      Well, long time no post. Went swimming the other day with Adam, Julia, Matt and his brother. Met the great Ryan of godly reknown. Ryan is some 13 year old kid with the drive to dance the horizontal mombo all over Julia (I'm sure that last line will be open to immediate criticsm and death threats). He spent the entire evening with us, hitting on Julia in the most obvious way, trying to shuffle off some of his friends-who-were-girls on me and Adam (no thanks, I said. I'm spoken for, I said). At the end of the evening while we men were waiting for Julia to change, he said to me and Adam, 'You know, I really like that Julia chick. She's hot. You know, I get my friends to say good things about me when I'm not around to the chicks I like, would you guys do that for me?' Me and Adam just smiled and nodded. As you could imagine, all the while home (to the bus stop, on the bus, to my house, in my house, leaving my house, to adams house and beyond) we were talking about whata great, great man that Ryan is. 'You know who owns this bus we're riding on? Ryan. He owns this bus, and all the busses. In fact, he owns the whole town. And the world! An beyond! Oh yeah, Mars, Saturn, Pluto. Wel, not all of Pluto. he shares half of it with King Melgazar. Yeah, they have a poker game every third friday, and me and Adam somtimes tag along. He's great people. Saved our asses in Nam. And WW2. AND WW1!! Yup, jumped on a grenade in our foxhole, saved us all. It was a beautiful act, but not nearly as beautiful as he. Rock hard abs, he has. Oooooh yessa, so rock hard they repelled the shrapnal from the grenade and killed three high rankning German officials in the process. One of whom was Hitler.'

      Oooah. Well now, isn't this a fad that's catching on fast. My two closest friends (Julia and Andrew) have both made respective blogs. This should be pretty cool to read, as they are pretty cool themselves. Well well well, not much is new. I went to Children's Hospital for an hour this morning and listened to a doctor tell me that is I stuck to my Vegan diet (long story, boring one at that) I could be a whole helluvalot smarter... Interesting.... Anyways, I blew off the other apointments I had at Children's and rushed to school for the double block. I didn't learn much, but I did learn my mark. 62.3%. Not too shabby for a guy who was told he was going to fail the course a little while ago. Andrew beat me up all day between German lessons this afternoon, because apparently I divulged secret information to his arch-nemesis. Who she is and what information about the pool I will post at a later date. Snigger snigger. Well, that's all for me, I'll talk to you all later. Nod

      Wow, I haven't posted since Thorsday? I feel so dirty... Anyways, I studied German with Andrew this afternoon for, something like, 3 hours! It was the mentally mind-damaging equivelant of being tortured by the Nazi Gestapo (secret police) in the fact that most of the insults were directed in English, but there was a fair bit of German flying around too. Went to the pool last night. It was pretty fun. There were some guys there who were friendly enough, but there were also 4 looking for a fight, one of whom was Mike Floyd. There's something seriously wrong with that man. He's always looking for fights, and'll make up reasons just to do one. Which he usually losses. Hung out with Crystal tonight. That was pretty cool, hadn't seen her for a loooong while. Hailey should'a just let us in the house in the first place, but, noooooooo.... jeez leweeeez woman.... Yay for Good Charlotte, though. =) Anyways, I used a couple new of catch-phrases today. One of them was 'The Horizontal Mombo' being a synonym for seeeeeeeeeex. The other being a quote from an old movie I was watching this morning. 'Nothing? Nothing!? Nothing, tra la la?!?!' -David Bowie as the Goblin King from The Labrinth And that's it for me, kids. Talk to you tomorrow. Nod

      Not much new here. My sister got mad at me because she read my Blog and found out I was using her Aveeno Body Wash. Beat me mercilessly she did. I went to audition for the Festival of Scenes with Adam the other day. It doesn't look good, bleak in fact, because Mr. Crymble has a thing against me. Last year, I volounteered to do the theatre production. Mr. Crymble (the drama teacher, I might add) confronted me later that day asking if it's alright if I come after school instead of at lunch. I said sure, why not? Knowing me, you've probably already heard this before. But, for those of you who may see me rarely (Crystal), have never seen me before (Kathleen), who I see all the time, but haven't been involved in my school life untill recently (Rourke), or who I've never seen outside of the hospital-Who does exist (Kelsey). Anyways, long story short, the next day Mr. Crymble pulled me out of Art class and talked to me in the hallway for, something along the lines of five minutes. He told me how he waited for a half hour after school waiting for me, how he missed his daughters Baseball game (which they lost) because of waiting for me. And, earlier that day, I had tripped on a desk and everyone laughed. The memory was still fresh in my mind, and I couldn't help but conceal a smile throughout his entire speech. So, Adam, if we get into the Festival of Scenes, it's because we are really, truly, the best of the best. And we will win through. No matter the cost. Nod

      I just wanted to give thanks were thanks is due. And that is everywhere but in Andrew's general direction. Really, have I ever encountered a more selfish and self-centered person. I kid,  I kid. Please don't hurt me. I'm sure Andrew's reading this now, fuming with his perma-rage while his face turns an even more passionate red. RED WITH BLOODY FURY! Andrew wrote everything on the last post up to the point where I boarded the bus with he and Adam. Minus a few tid-bits I added in here and there. Thanks Andrew. 'I can fly higher than an eagle. But you are the wind.... Beneath.... My.... Wiiiiiiiiiiingssssssss.....' Nod

      Well, here I am. At Andrew's newfound computer. I had to just tell Andrew not to tell me how to run my blog, but he can't be reasoned with.... Therefore, I've en-cancerated him... I'm sorry.  Yesterday was quite a day. It started with a call from Andrew himself. The man of the hour, if you will. 'Swimming?' he asked in his squeaky, upspeak voice. 'Why not?' I replied in my manly man voice. 'Now?' he asked again, this time, his voice rising with an air of confidence. 'Yes', I clearly stated, sending him back down the ladder of self-importance. Thus followed by an awkward silence. 'I love you,' I whispered, to which he replied simply, 'I know.' We then hung up mutually. I hopped in the shower, knowing that I only had a half hour to get to the bus stop. Thus following is an account of my Daily Morning Ritual. Firstly, I make sure there are two towels- one on the hanger, one on the floor. Secondly, I make sure that the heating and the fan are both on. I then get into the shower, and proceed to shampoo my hair, rinse thoroughly, and rinse clean, I then condition and repeat. Then I use Oxy Deep Cleansing Body Wash on my pink lofah sponge. After rinsing away the Oxy, I hop out of the shower thusly (bounce), shave (as I must do twice a day) and apply Neutrogena Pore Refining Lotion onto my face and rinse. Nextly, I apply my Self-Heating Daily Spa Treatment Mask, massage until it turns a sky blue, wait five minutes and rinse again. Back into the shower I hop, wetting my hair, and mix in Dove Two-in-One 24 Hour Weightless Moisturizing Shampoo and Condtioner. Rinsing thoroughly, I apply Avino Moisturizing Lotion into my sponge, wash it all over my body, and rinse thoroughly. I then get out of the shower, brush my teeth, flatten my hair and proceed with my day. However, in between showers, I gave Julia a phonecall whilst shaving. I asked her if she was going to the pool, and like all conversations with women, it was long, drawn out, and 75% pointless (please don't hit me). I concluded the conversation by suggesting she meet us at the pool, at a later time. I rushed out the door, being already 5 minutes late, and 'lo and behold, the bus that surely Adam and Andrew (Didn't I say Adam was coming? I think I did. Shattup.) would be taking. I hopped on thusly, and speedily arrived at the appointed destination, expecting to see Adam and Andrew at the pre-determined bus stop. But 'lo and behold (or else)..... They weren't.  I got off at the next bus stop and ran up the hill, while a passing-by jogger commented on my flawless form. 'Thank you,' I yelled back at him, and he laughed. Ouch. Adam and Andrew were just reaching the busstop as I reached it. Needless to say, I was angry. But, another bus speedily came, and we were due Westward once more. We arrived at the Leisure Center at about 12:30. There, we met Matt, his brother Aaron, and Steve. Us six guys swam around for a bit, finally agreeing to get a Water Polo game going. The quest for the Ball was long and arduous, involving three little girls who could seemingly dissapear and re-appear at will, and a little Asian boy who sucked at Basketball. In the end, one was throne at us from the pool, so we took it and ran. We set up the nets and got a game going. It wasn't long before other people joined us, trying to be as cool as I am. Including a reeeeally big guy in a black shirt who was reeeeeally unstopable. Fortunatley, he was usually on my side. Unfortunatley, when he wasn't, he headbutted me in the forehead, elbowed me in the eye, and was an all around ruffian. We got a ride home with Julia via Julia's dad, me, Andrew, Adam and I. Krystal, Steve, Matt and Aaron all went back to Matt's house, where I'm sure they were consumed by Matt's mother at the doorway. After I got home, I went to sleep. Slept for a half hour, had a shower, slept for two hours, woke up, got dressed in my Jam-Jams and went downstairs to eat popcorn and watch the DVD my sister Haley had just bought named, 'Princess Mononoke,' a japanese animation movie featuring the vocal talents of Gillian Anderson, Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Minnie Driver, Jada Pinketter Smith and Billy Bob Thornton. Goooood movie. It comes highly recommended by me, so go rent if not buy it. Go. Now. Nod.

      Wow. That was fun. I went to Chases' house for the first time. Ever. Well, that's not exactly true. Let me tell you a story.... It all started when I was around 7. My mom put me in 'Cub Scouts' because my best friend, Morgan was in it too. It was alright for the first... Hm... Year, I guess. But, as something usually does, something happened. One of the Cub Leaders was... Hm... Let's call him Chases' Dad, was always very critical of me, let's say. Anyways, one night we were in the gym and we were playing tag or some poor ass game like that that you play when you have no money for equipment. I was doing well, like I always do, and suddenly, BAM! Outa nowhere I trip and fall and skin my leg. I stayed down there crying for a little while Chases' Dad laughed at me and all the other kids did too. Ouch. Anyways, my crazy ass mom did some kind of weird charge thing and he had to apologize to me. Face to face. Man, was that awkward. Anyways, in about grade 9 I befriended a guy named Chase Dickinson. Quite a character was he, and always seemed to be getting into fights. Anyways, I was walking up Hammond Road once, and I took the time I do as always to glare up at the Cub Leaders house. And lo and behold, I see Chase going into that house. Nuts. Oh well, he's not that bad from the seconds I saw him tonight, and it wasn't even all that awkward when Chases' mom walked in on the steamy sex scene in the movie (Jason vs. Freddy) Lot's of Sodonomie jokes that night. Anyways, after the movie, Chase pulls out this crappy old video game system and we play this game called, like, Dragon's Lair. It's fun, it's like playing a cartoon. Anyways, more to come, I'm sure. I've let the general public know about me blog, so now all I have to do is let the praise come through.... Nod.

      I though I might take the chance to post some interesting fun fact's I've found out about my personna while adventuring at the site  urlLink Quizilla.com    What kind of insane guy are you?      What kind of Dark Person are you?    Dark shadow. Something has drawn you into darkness in the past, and you're now trying to get out of it. The darkness is already inside you, and getting it out will be hard, but if you try, maybe one day you can be who you want to be again. Don't give in!!!   What type of Soul do you have?    You are naturally born with a gift, whether it be poetry, writing or song. You love beauty and creativity, and usually are highly intelligent. Others view you as mysterious and dreamy, yet also bold since you hold firm in your beliefs.   What kind of Mythological Form are you?    You are Form 8,  Demon : The Destroyer.   "And The Demon took advantage of the chaos and seized civillization.  With grace and style, Demon slit The Goddess's belly and drowned the world in her blood.  The Goddess, The Demon, and the world were no more."   Some examples of the Demon Form are Seth (Egyptian) and The Horsemen of the Apocalypse (Christian). The Demon is associated with the concept of destruction, the number 8, and the element of earth. His sign is the full moon.  As a member of Form 8, you are a very strong willed individual.  You don't let others' opinions sway your own and you're usually not afraid to speak your mind.  However, some may see you as a bit overly passionate but it's just because you never back down from your values.  No matter what, you always do everything with style.  Demons are the best friends to have because they will back you up.   What feeling do you represent?    You represent... kindness. You're a very gentle, kind, and caring individual. You truely care about people and are generally well-liked.  Though sometimes you may be perceived as weak, you truely have a strong heart and a good desire to help others.  I think, all in all, I'm a pretty decent guy after looking at all these. Hey, take your own tests, tell me what kind of junk they tell you. I'll be here. Nod.

      Well well well. Here we are again, back at the ol'EQ machine. Except, what is this? EQ Severs are DOWN!? Well, I guess I'll post the latest Blog then. Sigh.... And I was so looking forward to it... Anyways, I thought I'd post my outstanding marks, proud as I am I'm NOT failing anything. German- 57% (just add on another 43%, 'cause I think I ACED that test today) Math- 72% (I just have a project and some work to hand in and I'll be home free!) Gym- 84% (I really should start speaking french in that classe. But, bien) And then my study block. Badaboom. The year at a glance. Well, not so much the year, more like a summester. Or term, I don't know school terminology. Nod.

      Just came back from the ol'gym with Adam. It was fun, but I only did half the time I usually do on the X-Trainer. Tomorrow I should go to his house and play X-Box, said he. And maybe I will, who knows what the future will bring? Anywho, tomorrow's Thursday and for those who aren't in 'The Know', that means a half-day. If you are not currently in 'The Know', please enter know. If you are not a member of 'The Know', please leave. Nod.

      There now, I think I'm gettin the hang of this thing. Just sittin here, eatin me oatmeal at 8:00am wondering if I'll make it in time to the Pep-Rally this morning. Doubtful. Oh well, I think it's alright to be late for that, right? RIGHT? Damned straight. But, anywho, I broke my promise. Please refer to last days Blog, and see somewhere before the end where I said I won't tell anyone about this untill(EXTRA 'L') it get's rolling? Well, I lied. Because I need a spell check and Andrew came on MSN as I was pondering this. Keep on truckin, AWS. For everyone's information, you may notice I say Nuts and Shapooka very often is you ever talk to me on MSN or otherwise. Nuts is just something I say around the house so my monkey neice won't pick up any (more) bad words, and 'Shapooka' is a comforting noise of my own design, used sincerely when someone is in pain to comfort them, or sarcastically when someone from North America is complaining how bad they got it.

      Well, this is the first Blog. I've always wanted to start a journal, and, well, here we are. This'll be to keep track of all the interesting things that go on in my life, as I've found that I have lot's of interesting things going on. For example, my several surrogate parents, my exploits of bravery, little jokes from Andrew's and Adam's, and BIG jokes from the bus. And by the way, I'm not going to tell anyone about this untill it get's rolling and I settle into a nice, sweat free routine. Oh well, tiptop and tally ho, wot? Onwards and upwards!

      Well, I'm off to go swimming soon. A just end to an entire day filled with nothing but chores, I think. I've also played MOH:AA off and on today. I love going through the levels using none lethal force (i.e. shooting them once in the leg, then knocking them unconcious with the butt of my gun) like the big nerd I am. Not a huge update, just wanted an excuse to change the little 'saying' thing at the top of the screen below 'tom's blog'. The evolution of this 'saying' section goes as follows-  Please. Read. No cancer bearing assassin is sneaking up behind you. Divert all your attention to the glowing mind box.  The original, baby! Let's thank God for that.  Man, I don't even go to the pool for the water polo anymore...  More brackets then you can shake a charred corpse at!  And now, I think I'll change it to something like-  NINJA! *summons shotgun* shik-shik...  Nod.

      Did you know there's been a rescent influx of my close and personal friends going to concerts latlely? I've never been to a concert before, let alone do I know who this Mayor of John is, Kelsey. Which I don't. Apparently, big bad Kelsey can sometimes convince her mom to let her let her stay home from school? I usually, you know, have to hit her with a bat or something so she's neutralized for 6 hours. My mom, that is, not hers.  So, I told my friends (Andrew and Adam (and Andrew's dad (I put him in brackets () because he's not technically my friend (althought don't get me wrong, I'm sure he's a great man (I mean, he put us all to shame in swimming, didn't he?))))) that I'd do the Triathlon with them, and training starts today. I know for damn well sure I couldn't possibly do a Triathlon now in my current asthetically pleasing yet sub-fit level, but it is my hope that this training will somehow help me with that. 'Train' me, if you will, to be able to be able to actually run (and swim and bike) that aforementioned triathlon. This 'Training' started today. At five. In the morning. In the pool. Doing laps... Actually, it wasn't that bad, as I used to be in competitive swimming and am pretty used to doing laps. But I suuure did pay for the time spent so ealry in the morning later on that day... There was a double block of Science today. I woke up at lunch and Adam was like, 'Hey, Thomas, did you get that paper done?' I was like, 'What paper?' He said, 'The one on the movie...' And I said, 'There was a MOVIE?!' (This was originally a letter to Kelsey, but I liked how I summed everything up so damn well I thought I'd put it in a bLog) (And on a totally unrelated topic, YOU'RE DEAD, S'NAY!)

      Wheeeeew.... What a day, what a day. Last night, my mom reminded me NOT to go to school, as I had a doctors apointment early tomorrow morning and we had to be out the door by 10. Unfortunatly, I syayed up reeeal late for another round of Conan O'Brien in Toronto, so I wasn't all that up to par when I was brought into conciousness at around quarter to 9 this morning. I hoped out of bed and was about to perform my extensive morning ritual (see 3rd blog for complete description) when there was a rapping, rapping at my bathroom door. It was my sister, Jxenna and her daughter/my niece Mia. It appears they needed the bathroom too. 'But I have a doctors appointment!' I argued. 'So does Mia!' and she picked the lock, grabbed me by the arm and through me out into the loft. I now realise it was a bad idea to teach how to pick locks, but, hey. Hindsight is always 20/20. I used my other sister's shower, Haley, and I've got to say, it was disguting. Loooong brown hairs all over the place, shampoo bottles and razors on the floor. Blech. Anyways, I finished up quick, through on some clothes and headed downstairs expecting my mom to be there grumpy because I was supposed to call the taxi about a half hour ago. She was not. 'Hm,' I thought to myslef. I opened her bedroom door and there she was, lying half dead from some weird flu. She said she wasn't going with me this time, and that I'd have to take the bus to the clinic. No problem, I take the bus to the pool all the time, and it's just a short walk from the leisure center to the clinic. I got five dollars for a late breakfast (or early lunch) and headed out the door with my sister's CD player in my pocket... He he he... That'll show'er that the morning ritual is not to be disturbed... I was walking up my street and I saw the bus leave. Crap. Oh well, so I sat down on the bench by the busstop and took out my book. It was at least a half hour before the next bus came, damn am I glad I brought my book. I got off at the stop I usually get off to go swimming, and turned into the building by the Iron Horse Memorial Clock. I went up to floor six and talked to the receptionist. I opened the conversation with a casual, 'Do you know what time it is?' She said no, she didn't. I guessed she wasn't much for small talk. Apparently, I'd missed my appointment and was not going to get another one. With a light heart, I left the clinic, and just walked west for about fifteen minutes, not knowing or caring where I was to go. I stopped in at Subway for a veggie sandwich, and got it in my head to go see the sights of Maple Ridge Seconday, our brothers to the East. I set out for Morgans' house, because from there, I could easily find my way to Merkley Park, and I was told by Morgan once that Ridge was just beyond there. It took me about a half hour of walking, I passed the familiar settings of Morgan's street, and I trudged down the pathway that connects Merkley to 221st street. I gazed out and whistled appreciatively. There in fron of me was a field and track far superior to our in the West. And, on the other side, was a huge set of bleachers, with one or two huddled circles of people standing on it. I continued my journey, making mental notes of all the different circles I passed. It seemed odd to me that they would be so easily defined from one another, almost as if each circle or crowd had it's own dress code. In our hallway and most of our school, people wear mostly the same things, regardless of what circle they were in. Here, it appeared that was not the case. I passed onto a road and infont of the school. I feared going into the school itself, alone anyways, because I have had bad experience with that kind of thing. Once, I was chassed away from Pitt River Middle School by there principle. I was just trying to find Rourke to tell him we were ready to go! In front of the school was the highest concentration of people I'd seen yet, but the most interesting were, of course, the Goths. They were closest to the road and were wearing what you'd expect a Goth to wear (that being black), but there apparent leader was something to see. Spikey, black hair, pale complexion, a long black coat, chains and hooks protruding from most orifices in his body, and red makeup trailing down his cheeks and up to his hairline from the corners of his eyes. I continued down this street, and I chose to change course onto Acadia Street, as it's name striked me as interesting. I questioned one of the local students if this road took me to the highway, and he said yes, so I headed down this route with a passion. Lo and behold, did the suburban innards of Maple Ridge vomit me out into my familiar surroundings. And no sooner than that, did I find a busstop with a crowd of people packing into a bus. I rode that bus all the way back to Davison Road, and at the mouth of the road, did I see my sister and her daughter/my neice. I quickly pocketed her CD player and walked with her home. It appeared she had been stricken with the same disease as has be-plagued my mom. I hope I do not fall into it's clutches as well... Nod

      'Hmm... Oh, hello. Didn't see you come in there. Now now, don't be shy. Take a seat.' You see the man you know as Tom lean back in his old recliner cusion chair. The plaid patterns covering the thing are faded and stained, suggesting a long life of seatings and sitting-like situations. 'Ahh... Where did we leave off? Ooooh, yes, that's right. I was talking about that great Ryan man, wasn't I? Seems like an age ago since we last sat down here in this old room, smoked our pipes and twiddled our toes, eh? Now, let's see what's happened to our hero since then...'   Sorry about the lame intro, but I've wanted to do a 3rd person thing since I started. If you've born with me this far, you must know me well. Or not at all and are reading on despite that nagging voice in the back of your mind telling you to press that back button on your browser, for the preceding and proceding proses contain nought but the insane self-dialogue of an insane and possilby mentally defficient man. The voice is all to correct, however, it is too late to turn back now. I have disabled this 'Back' button, and will only return you to this page once pushed! AAHAHAHAHAHAH!!  Actually, that's not true at all, and am ashamed at how blatantly I've just lied to you. Wonder why I haven't posted in so long? Well, as you know if you know me at all, I tend to not follow through with most things unless they mean a great deal to me. Not that this blog is anything but high quality stuff and that I am tired of it. I just don't... Do... Things... Like... Uh.... Julia, finish my scentence.  What? Oh, where was I? AH, 10:20 on the dot. Sorry, I'll post more tomorrow. Don't worry, as if Julia and Andrew naggings to update my scripures wasn't enough, Crystal asked me if I would too. So, like any man, I caved. Have you SEEN her eyes?  Anywho, I'll talk to you all tomorrow, I did tell my sister she could get on at 10:20, and look how the time has gone!  Nod.

      Well, long time no blog. After recovering from the incredible boredom that was my spring break, I've decided to take a wide swing at the ressurection of this place...  I turned 16 yesterday. WOOOOT!!! Finnaly, I can learn how to drive! Except, my stupid overbearing mom says she won't sign the forms that let me take the exam until I get a job. And she won't insure the car until I bring home straight B's on my report card... I'm thinking of applying at Mc D's, because John's nephew is a Manager there and John says he can get me in guaranteed... That remains to be seen, mind you, as I don't strike anyone let alone myself as someone who'll be able to hold their first job for any long period of time. By the way, speaking of being 16 - I'm inviting everyone to come to the theatres with me on Friday to go see a movie to celebrate my turning 16 and all. It's not a  Party    per say... More of a celebretory get together. The difference is this: I won't pay for your admission into the theatre (except crystal, because it's about time we did something that felt like a 'date') but, in return for my incredibly blatant cheap-ass-ness, you don't have to bring a gift. Not that you CAN'T bring a gift. You   just don't  have to bring a gift  . Get it? Oh, in case you've not noticed, I figured out how to work the Italics and Bold bits... -Nod

      Woo... Man, have I been sick the last few days. Seems to me I'm always sick just before a holiday break is over... Oh well. I'm going to go to school tomorrow... Which is unfair because apparently I missed a bunch... Adam came back. Andrew will be back tuesdayish... And i have no idea where chase went or when he's coming home. So I was sitting there watching a new episode of Angel when my neice came in to say goodnight. I gave her a hug and returned to my TV box, when I saw her leaning over my just refilled glass of Ginger Ale. I looked at her in a "what the hell do you think your doing?" look. She smiled, stuck her two year old tongue out and dipped it in the glass. Ewwwwwwww!!! Needless to say I pored it out... She's still sick and the LAST thing I wanna do is go through all that again... Some things I did on the fever I just don't... Feel... Like writing about. -Nod

      well, nothing really happened today until i went to starbucks with crystal, julia, hailey and they're travelling troupe. we all got coffees and sat around and kinda chilled. we had to cut it fairly short, because they had a part to get back too and i had heard whipers of swimming.  i went straight home after me and crystal parted ways only to jump out the door right after to catch the bus to go. only andrew and allon showed up. so we just did some lengths, some diving, lot's of robe swinging. we did this fun game we made up where we'd throw the ball in the bigger kiddie pool and then run with our arms above the water. it was pretty draining, lol. they kicked us out at 9:30 because the leisure center was closing at 10 and they thought it would take us forever to get changed. it was kind of awkward, cuz they kicked EVERYONE out at the same time... so there was like 20 other guys in there with us... -shivers- we walked to the busstop, sat on the bench, and this handicapped guy on a scooter sat right next to me. like, reeeeal close. he laughed at everything he saw, and i felt sorry for the guy, but also really scared for me... then, a weird old lady sat right next to allon and joined in our converstion. and took control of it! it was pretty creepy... we sat at the back of the bus with noone there except a normal looking guy. he asked the time (it was 10:02) and then cracked open a huge can of kokanee on the bus. ON the BUS! foam went everywhere, it was pretty nuts. he got off several stops later, staggering and falling all the way to the doors. andrew got off first. then allon. it was the last time i'll see andrew for a while, because the lucky bastard's going to mexico until next wednesday... grr...  allon got off at the video store, he said he was going to rent 'Scarface,' a very awesome movie if i do say so. with allon gone i was left alone with my thoughts... most of which were crystal related. speaking of which... HAPPY ONE MONTH,  CRYSTAL! I asked her out on valentines day 31 days ago and i couldn't be luckier!

      Hm. Hm hm hm... Hmmmm... Everything's coming together rather neatly, I'd say. Yesterday I had the day off (yesterday being Tuesday) because it was student/parent/teacher interviews day! The previous night I'd gone swimming with an unprecidented number of people-Andrew, Adam, Matt, Aaron, Amanda, Courtney, Krystal, Julia, Kiley and... I think there was someone else, i dunno... Anywho, needless to say I was tired after that 3 hours of swimming and then hour and a half of pointless walking around. I had to wake up early, however, as I had a doctors appointment early in the morn' the next day. I caught a ride with Leila (mother of Morgan and babysitter of Mia) and she dropped me off at the big tower place by the pool where the guy works. The guy did the usual check-up and sent me on my way. I caught a bus home because i'd promised my mom i'd not go galavanting around to MRSS again like I did last time I went to that very same doctor. sorry crystal... On my way out the door of the bus, who did I see but amanda and courtney, boarding the same bus i was just leaving on their way to the mall. We said our hello's and goodbye's and i headed home. With absolutely nothing to do but MoH:AA online (of which I was dominating that day with the sniper rifle) I contacted Andrew on MSN and got together for some signature Tom'n'Drew cliché wackiness. He was about to kick me out of his house because he and his mom were going to the P/S/T interview, so I decided to come along. Someone might as well care about my education, right? So I saw Mr. Guzyk, and I was about to talk to him when suddenly a family ran over to him first. So I went to go see Mr. Okada, my science teacher. He said he was happy with the way I've been doing, less chat, more study for tests and I should be good for a B. Mr. Guzyk was again busy, so I consulted my study teacher at the other end of the school. She had really nothing to say, so I went back to the main gym and was about to talk to Mr. Guzyk finally when Mrs. Brown, my social's teacher pulled me aside. I'm not doing as well as I could be, but I'll probably do fine was about the gist of it. Then FINALLY i finally got my bloody Mr. Guzyk, who's my English teacher. Nothing but good things did he have to say about me, just try not to talk to julier so much in class and shut up during silent reading. Other than that, I've doubled my mark in English and made an amazing recovery. Cool. I also saw Hidalgo, but this block is almost over and I must make this short. Man, I've seen three movies in the past four days! Starskie and Hutch on Friday, Passion of the Christ on Sunday and Hidalgo just last night! Cool. -Nod.

      Well, here I am in my study block. I did go down to andrew's house, though. Then to The Passion of the Christ. It was good, I must say. And I'm no religious zealot, believe you me. He had the best line, though. One of his disciples was, like, fighting off these guys trying to arrest jesus with a sword, and christ was like, 'Peter, put down the sword,' and Pete looked at Jesus like he was a nut. And Jesus said to him all smooth like, 'He who lives by the sword, will die by it.' WOOOO! Go GOD! Aaaaaaanyways.... In other news, amanda was late picking me up. it hurt, i had to say. i saw her on the way to school in her car, and i somehow go to school faster than her on my bike! It was quite the victoire. For me, anyways. I dunno about the rebublic of Iran, but I'm sure they SOMEHOW prospered... they always do... -shakes fist in trumulous rage- -Nod

      It was hailey's birthday yesterday, so happy birthday hailey. Crystal went to Hailey's house, and since Hailey lives so damn close to my house, they the three (Crystal, Hailey, and their mutual friend Amanda (or maybe it was Ashley, i dunno)) met me at Edith McDermott. We went to Starucks and got some drinks/low-fat brownies (all I had was a frappucino) and, after an incredibly long time in the baseball field and a staring contest of wills between me and Hailey, we all went to my house. yeah... We just sat on the couch, watching Simpsons until Mrs. Hailey's Mom picked up the three and left me standing all alone... -cry-.  But, luckily, Andrew phoned with good news. There was to be a meeting. A meeting of good and strong Men at the pool. So i slapped on my bathing trunks and set out with my trusty steed Adam's Car to the Leisure Center. There we (we being Adam, Chase, Andrew and I) met them (Matt and Aaron) and we did the usual rope swinging, cannon balls off the diving board, sauna, steam room, keep-away (teams), and the usual rapscallion-like activities I'm bound to get up to when at the pool. Anywho, speaking of Andrew, I WAS going to go down to Rourke's today, but apparently he had a 'work' thing at the Thai restaurant near the McDy's (I for one didn't know that it was involved in the drug trade around Pitt Meadows). So I might as well give Andrew a call. Play some MoH:RS. yeah. Take care of yourself and your loved one's. -Nod.

      I had a dream last night. It was nutty. Hence my MSN name.  Me and my family and Morgan's family were relaxing at a little place called Long Beach. And Crystal showed up (somehow) and told me that she was moving away. Like, faaaaar away. Anyways, her family was there (her mother and her step-dad which I've never seen before) and they were all nervous-like. They kept saying, 'Crystal, it's time to go,' and Crystal, 'We MUST leave now.' They left, but they came back. Very soon. Very violently. Seems Crystal's family was under some kind of curse, and that's why they wanted to move so quickly. They had been transformed into weirdly coloured were-creatures. The mom was a snake, the dad was an ogre thing, and Crystal was a wolf. They killed Morgan and his family and mine, but I got away, swimming under a huge bridge over the water. They eventually left and I was an orphan. A-boohoo. I journeyed on in my cool ass kickin robes (i was kind of a mage guy) and I eventually made it to this tower in a far off land. In this tower, there was this big Mage convention and I was there to find a spell that would release Crystal and her family. At this tower, I met Kelsey and her family (just her mom, actually. i'm amazed i remember what she looks like) apparently, Kelsey was an accomplished healer-type and she said she'd help me on my quest. As all this was happening, Crystal and her family were going on a mass killing spree looking for me. They'd taken out something like 3 villages single handedly and were seemingly unstoppable. We went outside the market-town that surrounded the tower and walked for a couple days, seeing the mass carnage the three had spread. Kelsey said she knew the spell that would cure them, so we pressed on.  Crystal and her family were at the spot I left thim, by a huge bridge that crassed and ocean. We fought for what seemed like 3 days (I accidently killed her step-dad with my staff-thing) and finally Kelsey cured them! And everyone live happily ever after... The end.  Yes, it's a lame dream. But it's my dream and I wrote it. Nod.

      Sigh... This is kind of a depressing post. As most of my readers know, things have not been going so well with Crystal and me. I sent her an e-mail asking her where she wanted to go in our relationship and why she just, all of a sudden, stopped talking to me one day. It's been three days now with no message back, and I'm loosing hope... In other news, Keith is a looser because he doesn't acknowledge the superiority of FF III. Quelle folle... While we're on the subject of FF III, Steven says he'll come through for me by the end of the week. He'd better. Else it'll be 'is 'ead it will it will. I saw Killbill Vol. I with Adam, Andrew, Chase and Greg tonight. It was pretty good, but kind of slower the 2nd time around. Still an awesome movie, though. Seriously looking forwards to Sunday, as we're going to go watch it then. Well, ta. -Nod

      Although my initial plan to see Crystal failed today, fate as always, smiles upon me. Krystal (Kerr is her last name, not Tomsgirlfriend) talked me up on the MSN and said she'd be in the neighborhood. She was wondering if I was busy and if I could help her and her pally's film a french project and, later, work on socials. And that we did. She swung by, and we headed to Badass Coffee. We got mocha's (she paid because of my stupid bank card)and we went to the park, where a bunch of people were setting up their camera. It was another project for this french, like 'Ultimate Cops and Robbers'. Well, theirs was called 'Capture the Ketchup', and it was quite entertaining. They scattered brightly coloured envelopes all over the field. In the envelopes were either salt, vinegar or ketchup. Salt and vinegar were each worth -10 points, and a ketchup was worth 3 points. Two teams, black and red, all with custom face paints (mine was cool. black all over my lower face and up the bridge of my nose coming up into a T on my forehead. also, a warrior rune and a cross were on either side of my face on my cheeks). Teams must collect envelopes and tackle members of the opposing team if they have envelopes of their own. If you succeed in throwing your target to the ground, you get their envelopes. After 5 minutes, the teams are called back and the envelopes are tallied up. There are four rounds of 5 minutes, we played on the field, in the woods, on the playground and in the water park. Afterwards, I was covered in face paint. I washed up partially at the public washrooms in the park and headed to subway with Krystal and some girl I didn't know. Me and Krystal left, while the girl went to her job at McDee's, and we returned home to work on socials. She got some done, I did nothing, and then I waited at the busstop with her. After I got back, I went on MSN for a bit, and Amanda logged on. She said she wasn't feeling well, so I asked if I could swing by and pick up the CD she made me. It is most awesome and I wuv it so... Eeeehehehehe!!! As I was somewhat pressed for time, I transplanted most of this blog from and email to Kelsey. Still laughing at how little you know about the Gods, Kel. -Nod

      Well, today was awesomely fun. At around noonish I, along with several others went to Jenna's house to work on a most extremely cool video project they were doing. It was in french (for the most part) and Julia, Jenna and the other Jenna had to make up a game. There's was called 'Ultimate Cops and Robbers'. There are two teams. Cops are armed with water guns and robbers are armed with water balloons. If you are hit by either of these weapons, regardless of what team you are on, you are out of the game and have to go to jail for the ramainder of the round. The robbers have in their possesion a football (or, 'Treasure'). This Treasure was stolen from the cops and the seek to reclaim it for unknown purposes... Probably sexual in origin. If the robber carrying said Treasure is hit by water, the game is over. The Treasure can be passed between robbers. The object of the game is for the group of robbers to make it all the way around the block and back to their hideout without getting killed or loosing the treasure. Needless to say, it was a blast. Lots of friendly fire on the cops team, though. LOTS of running scenes carrying heavy equipment... After that was completed, I went back home and Amanda picked me up. We met Courtnie at the Shell and took the bus to the Leisure Center. That's where a bi\unch of us were going to meet and go swimming. Unfortunately, it was closed, so we just sat around and waited for the people to show up. Once everyone came, we headed on down to Matt's house, played some football, ate some BBQ related products and watched the game. Which we lost, unfortunately... After the game, Matt plugged in the movie 'School of Rock'. I like that movie, but apparently it was not enough to hold Courtnie's attention, and she nodded off. Everytime I got up to get something to drink, she'd roll over and start flailing her arms at me. She snored (very loudly) and cried 'No no no!' and 'No Santa!' a couple of times. Oh, and she said, 'Shh shh shh...' once. All the while asleep. It was very disconcerting. When she woke up, she told us how in her dream she was abducted by Santa and became one of hs Elves. Hm. How quaint. Kiley's dad gave us a ride home, me courtnie and amanda, and kiley made her father out to be some big bad ogre. I found him to be pretty cool, so i don't know what she's on... as always, i'll update whenever something cool happens. ciao -Nod

      Well, this was kinda a fun day. First block we had sciences humaines, and we went down and ate the projects of the grade nines... That caramel pie was pretty damned fine. I got my resume done in D block, and after school i gave it in to the Shell, IGA and Subway. I think I'm definitly gunna get the Shell, but IGA wouldn't be too bad for like, a thursday and sunday thing. I walked my dog, too. Did my homework and am currently doing my laundry AND writing in my blog!! it's MADNESS! So, for the most part it was a pretty different day, except for the fact I still haven't talked to crystal for a good week or two. that's pretty standard stuff... -Nod

      Wheeeeew... What a fun night. Finally got around to celebrating my 16th year of existance. It would have been the crappiest of nights with any other group of people, but these were my closest friends - Adam, Allon, Amanda, Andrew, Chase, Julia, Julie, Krystal and Mike (all in alphabetical order). We assembles all at my house and kind of just talked innanely about the goings on of our lives. Mike came first... Then Amanda and Julie, then Allon. Julia next, then Andrew arrived, followed by Adam finally. By the time we left, it was about 5:20 PM. We went to the busstop and concluded we were going to go see Hellboy at Silvercity. After several well-timed busses, we made it to Silvercity by 6:30. The next showing of Hellboy was at 7, so we kinda kicked back and ate some dinner at the restraunts over there. I personally had some New York Fries fries and a coke. Then I bought some Whoopers (as is tradition) and we all headed into the theater. The movie was pretty good. Most of the trailers crapped ass, though. Except Punisher, which looks pretty cool. The movie itself was all about those damn Nazi's trying to destroy the world using giant tenticle demons. Which would've been a briliant ploy and I'm sure would've succeded easily had the instigators not been Nazi's. Let me point out, because I feel I have not stressed this enough in my blog. Nazi's are horrible, horrible people. But they're not nearly as good at what they do as they think they are. I mean, they lost world war 2, all the indiana jones movies, that movie with the neo-nazis and the nukes... I think it was called 'Ultimate Fear' or something... AND just now, they tried to destroy the world with evil demon creatures. In my books, Nazi's are only  slightly   less incompetant than Ninja, and only  just   as incompetant as, say... Skeletor. Anyways, I won't ruin the ending for you, but 7 out of the people who saw it with me thought it was fairly good. We waited at the busstop for about 2 hours until it finally came, and then it was smoooth sailing all the way home. Getting home, I arrived to find Paul and my sister Jenna in a heated debate about the teachers in our school. I found out that Paul does the greatest impressions in the world, and we bashed Mr. Duick, Mrs. Girard, Mrs. Goodwin AND my personal favorite, Tom-Eric. Wooo, man. Then the conversation turned slowly into a nice chat about the Final Fantasy games series, when my sister Haley joined our witty parlée. We talked about the Final Fantasy 10 game I borrowed from Allon, and the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles I rented for the Game Cube... Then we shifted to the greatest game of all time, Final Fantasy 3/6 (3 being for the SNES, 6 being for the PS1. Same game down to the letter, but 6 has cinematic cutscenes). We talked about the highlights of the game, like Celeste and her suicide attempt when her newly found father died and she jumps off a cliff. Then we talked about the opera bit and Paul said, 'I still remember the song Celeste sung at the opera house bit...' and he started humming it (it has no lyrics, because the game was made in like, the 80's and was mostly on the keyboard) and pretty soon, we had a huge song going, humming and roaring like the kinda drunk feeling you get when you stay up late. And late it was, pushing 1:15. We all went our seperate ways and I stayed up like a looser and typed up this blog. Appreciate my love. -Nod.

      Many people have been asking me what my perculiar jacket is made of. I then usually reply with a sly smile that it is made from the flayed and tanned hides of many newly born babies. I have to change the skins daily to keep them fresh, and the coat itself makes the sound of a crying child whenever i move my arms. Unfortunatly, it takes many children to replace even one day's worth of use, as i only use the back and scalp skin, and much magic because it is bound together by their souls. I believe the authorities are getting suspicious... Oh well, if they come after me, i'll just don my cloak and attack them with my Necromantic powers. Did i not tell you my powers as a Necromancer are boosted 50 fold when i wear the 'Cloak of Children Souls'. In other news, i found the song 'Whiskey in the Jar' by Metalica. Now, normally, Metalica is a little too 'Hardcore' for 'Me', but i reeeeally like this song. It sounds cool and like an irish drinking song!! 6 Days until the 60th Anniversary of D-Day, baby!  The Day? June Sixth, Nineteen-Forty Four. The Time? 6:02 AM The Objective? Various batallions of infantry will storm six beaches, codenamed Sword, Gold, Silver, Juno, Omaha, Utah with the hopes of taking out German anti-aircraft defenses. English troops will take Gold and Silver beaches, America will take Sword, Omaha and Utah. That leaves Canada with Juno. What happend? I'll tell you more as the week progresses... -Nod (oh, and... this is a very evil post... if you didn't know me, you'd think i was a deeply disturbed and all around evil individual... i mean, what kind of freak listens to metalica!?)

      While doing my laundry this morning, i came to a very important fact about myself. i found myself putting in relatively few socks into the machine, as opposed to the ratio of other cloth materials (over-shirts, petticoats, pantaloons, unmentionables and so forth). at the same time, i was wondering what i found most attractive in someone of the opposite sex. that being chicks. i've found that i'm looking for a girl with a guys size 9 to 11 foot and lots of white ankle socks she doesn't mind sharing. ALSO, continuing on this, i promised myself a little while ago i wouldn't shave until i fell in love. now, my sister mentioned an interesting point about this. how do i find love when i look like grizly adams? well, this is where i need some help. do i go through with my pact with myself, or do i just continue my regular shaving routine?  Answers to the foot-fetish thing and advice on the beard should be put in the comments section under this post. -Nod

      I changed my blog around to commemerate my 40th post. yay me. And also, here's a story to keep you entertained as i steal your money and children...  Kelsey (italic) and I (normal) were talking one rainy day on MSN...   Very original msn name you've got yourself there Tom    How’d ya come up with somthin like that?   Well, I spent years in silence with the Tibetan Shao-Lin monks, praying for divine favor and wisdom  Then, Aman Ryashi, my patron deity, came to me in a Shukan induced vision  And she said 'Amar un tuyen induviel kalondair...'  Which, of course means, ‘Follow the western light, and it will lead you to your destiny…'  Of course, the sun rises in the east, so I followed the moon  For several months I sailed in a tiny one man vessel, eventually landing on the shores which is now Triplee  Then, of course, it was inhabited only by cannibals. They swarmed me as soon as I left my boat   Lol!   I managed to take down five with my massive axe before succumbing to their poisonous arrows  I woke up with a beautiful native girl looking over me  She spoke in a quick, Spanish dialect that was hard to follow at first, but I picked up her meaning   Lol   She said, 'I am the chiefs daughter and high priestess to the one deity, Inuk’Shuk  'You, the blonde haired axe man, were foretold to come here and take me to fulfill my destiny, as Inuk’Shuk was told by another deity, Aman Ryashi'  So, I took her as my traveling wife, and with blessings from both the Aman Ryashi AND the Inuk’Shuk faiths, we journeyed on westward towards the setting moon   Dear god, where do you come up with this? You should write a book or somthin    Lol   Not done yet  Later on, I learned her name was Shojoorn. When she asked for my name in exchange for hers (as we were performing the name exchanging ceremony at the time) I was as surprised as she was to learn I hadn't actually had one...   So you just came up with 'Tom' huh?    Lol   No no…  We continued to journey westward, following the moon at night and hunting and resting during the day  When all of a sudden, we came upon the World's End   Cool! I've always wanted to go there!   We made camp by the shores of the World’s End, and I noticed the next morning, Shojoorn was visibly shaken  I asked her if she had had another vision  But she disregarded the question and continued to pack up  We stood over the world edge, when suddenly, a winged figure rose up and swooped away with Shojoorn in his arms!   Tough luck huh?   I knew that this was the terrible Chosooth! Vampire of the Worlds End!   Lol    Darn him, always gettin in the way   I followed him to his lair and fought a great and bloody battle with him that lasted four days and four nights  When no longer could I lift nor wield my mighty axe, I broke the shaft in two and plunged the wooden stake into his black heart  With an earth shattering scream, he exploded into flame, and from a fissure in the earth came a hundred hands of all the men he had sent to the underworld before their time, and they had their final, bitter revenge upon him by dragging his smoldering ruins down to the Plains of the Dead  I ran over to where my beloved wife, Shojoorn lay  I held her close and cried many tears  The tears fell onto her, reviving her once living body if only for a minute.  She said she had had a vision of all of this  Of her death and the death of Chosooth  And also, when before she crosses over to the Forever Plains,  Where she tells me my name   Aww, how sweet   The name given to me by Vana’Diel, supreme goddess of all gods  Tom   Lol, how special   I thought so…

      Went to andrew's after school today. He did his triathlon tuesday, and we're all exceptionally proud of how he soundly trounced adam by cheating. Way to go... Jerk. Rained today for the first time in a bit, it was a nice change of pace from the incredible heat wave of late.  Of which i contribute to global warming... D'you know how big the hole in the o'zone layer is!? Well, i have a book that tells me, 'Stupid White Men' by Micheal Moore. I'd get it for you... But i'm lazy, and for all i know about who's reading this, i don't like/know you.:D Such a funny book, though. He's the guy who made the 'Bowling for Columbine' movie (also very funny). Well, I'm on my way out the door. Thinkin i'll hit the oooold gym. After simpsons...

      So, I just got back from the gym. Today was a specially long inning to mark my 'One Week of Healthy Living' pact. And now I feel reeeeeally wiped... Blargh... I saw Mike'n Julie mom there, we chatted it up. I also read 'Stupid White Men and Other Sorry Excuses for the Stats of the Nation' by Micheal Moore... Sooooo funny... Last night was fun. Good kick-off to the long weekend. I headed down to the pool and met up with Jessica (or Jess) and her sister Alley. We found Matt and Aaron, then Erin arrived. Finnaly, after a good hour, Trevor and Amanda showed up. Matt, Amanda, Jess and me went down to Matt's Tae Kwon Do place and hung there for a bit, then me and Jess went to the bowling alley to meet up with the others. They, being as competant as Trevor, of course were not there. So me and Jess played some arcade games 'till they came. While we were there, three weird kids came up to us and engaged us in conversation. US! ... And the one with braces kept on patting Jess on the shoulder and back... Finally the rest of the group arrived and they left us alone. Me, Jess and Alley played one game, and Trevor, Amanda and Erin played another... I sooooo won in our game! After the first game, Jess and Alley had to leave, so me and Amanda just watched Trevor and Erin play another game (Erin crushed him). In the end, we picked Matt up from Tae Kwon Do and headed down to Mac's. He and Amanda went to his house to play some Shrek 2 (awesome movie... Pray for mercy from Pus! .... in BOOTS!) Me, Trevor and Erin got a ride home at Mac's from Erins mom. Thanks again. Aaaaaaanyways, that's about it. I think I'ma gunna give Andrew a call and finally see that damn movie he's always talking about. -Nod

      Weeeeee-oo. It's been a while. I blame Jess. And Kelsey. And my love of all things paintball. First off, Jess has gone away, far away to the damned east that seems to swallow the people closest to me whole and allow me ne'er to see them more. Saskatchewan (spelling?) she called it, but I know better... She must be imprisoned in the keep of the dread Necromancer!! Oh god! I must save her! In other news, I seem to be addicted to Kelsey's blog. It's just so... So fun to tease her about it on the commentaries. Fun, and easy too. I went paintballing for the first time ever sunday. Needless to say, I ruled some major ass out there. I mean, I was unstoppable! Except, you know, the two or three times I was stopped... That kinda sucked... But other than that, I was fairly awesome. Lucky, too. Adam'n them didn't believe my super power was luck, I'm sure I proved them wrong that day. Other than thaaaat, not too much is new. I am actually really for truth this time going to hotrocks today, and I'm going to see Spiderman 2 tomorrow -swoon- -Nod

      Beastman AIDS, Julia? How does one go about contracting such a rare disease? Just curious. Yesterday was fun. I set out on my bike with a number of items in my packsac. Items such as my yearbook, Matt's yearbook, Krystal's shirt, swim trunks, a scone... You know, standard adventuring stuffs. My first stop, not only for the obvious reasons, but because there was a deadline involved, was Jess' house. She and her sister were leaving at two to go to the island for a bit -She used to live there, I think she's going to see some friends- I made it there at around one forty and pretty much stayed until their father showed up to drive them to the terminal. I also got Jess to sign me yearbook :) My next stop was to Krystals' house. I made it there just as she was leaving for the busstop, so I decided to take the bus a bit with her (as it was going in the general direction I needed). We waited for what seemed like hours, and right when I was about to die from heat exaustion, it came!  I had to put a tooney in the machine because of my lack of foresight... And loonies... Me'n Krystal went to the mall for a bit, then she got on the 701 that took her to her grandmas', and I continued on bike to Matt's house. I was biking down the street with the Mac's on it, when suddenly I saw Morgan and his cousin Matt (different Matt) biking around. We joined up, went to Mac's for a slurpee, and biked to Matt's (Haynes) so I could drop off his yearbook. He wasn't there. He and Allon had gone to the hotrocks, apparently, but I'm not dissapointed. As far as I know neither Jess, Julie, Julia, Andrew, Adam, Erin, Chase, Krystal or any of Hailey's friends went. And they're the life of the party. So I gave his book to his mom, and his mom in turn gave me back my baby-skin jacket I left there a while ago! Thanks mrs. Haynes, but I don't think I'll be needing it today... Or these next three months... So, us three continued on and we stopped off at the OTHER Matt's house (Morgan's cousin). We played Battlefield: Vietnam on his computer for a while, that was pretty fun. That game has an awesome soundtrack. All these songs from the sixties... I then continued alone down to Morgan's house (as he and his cousing were getting a ride from his grandparents...), and there I not only had dinner, but also completed the SNES game Donkey Kong. Yup, the entire game in one sitting. All the way from Jungle Hijinks to King K. Rule himself. Hardest level? The first one in the industrial world... GAWD! We lost, like, ten lives there alone! Aaaaanyways, after dinner I biked home, talked to Erin for a bit, flaunted my chest on the webcam, and today I'm going to go see Stepford Wives on my sisters advice. Oh, and happy fathers day, Dad 'n' grandpa's. -Nod

      Aw... Man. Now, that was a funny movie. Dodgeball, that is. I just can't get enough of Ben Stiller, He's just so neat. What with his quaffed hair and 'Deus ex Machina'. Now that was unexpected! Too bad, Mrs. West. Instead of attending your own multi-conglomerate-supporting party, y'could've gone to see a movie with a gang of people you didn't know consisting of... Andrew! Krystal! Allon! Tyler! Amanda! And me, of course. Speakin of me (because, hell, when are we NOT?) I'm going swimming sometime today... At some place called 'HotRocks'. Should be fun. I'll talk to ye all later, then.

      Weeeooo... Well, this has been an eventful week, let me tell you. Nothing IMMEDIATLY springs to mind, but let me tell you. Even though Harry Potter 3 sucked so bad the first time, its sucky-ness was so much the second time around that its original foundation of suck couldn't support its overall sucky mass and it collapsed into itself, creating some kind of anti-matter gravity suck well. And it was still better then Titanic. Also, the company was good. First time around I saw it with just Julia. Which was fun, but none of our jokes made sense. The second time around I saw it with... Lesse here... Jess, of course. Her sister, Alley. Erin and Aaron. Aaron's brother (Matt, durh), Allon the Strong annnnd.... Julie! That's the one. Oh, and Jess' man-cousin. I will call him Mousin (a hybrid word of man and cousin, pronounced "muh-zin") for all intents and purposes. After the movie, I went to Julia's birthday party (this is saturday, by the by) and me, her, Andrew the Wise, Chase (not The Chase, some actor coincidentally named Chase), his girlfriend who sucks at Halo, Cam the Giant, Brandon, Matt (not Haynes), Krystal, Kiley and Hailee. It was fun, we tried to watch 'The Last Samurai' wich sounds cool, as sexy Tom Cruise apparently kills 100 ninja. We ate cake and food, which was VERY fun, because everytime Brandon ate something he'd say what it was. Like... 'Tomato...' 'Ketchup???' 'FRENCH FRY!!!' We went swimming at the wave pool, that was pretty fun. Loads of people there, though. Not like at the Leisure Center where we usually go. Oh, and for all the people coming over here from   urlLink Kelsey's Blog , I say, "Welcome to a significanlty more interesting and better typed Blog, over all." -Nod

      Oh, yes. And for everyone who wants to know (and I know you all do), I have assembled a mighy band of heroes.  Tom - No powers, he's kinda like Batman. Andrew the Wise - Has incredible intelligence and is able to manipulate object using only his mind Adam, The Electric Kid - Can expell electrical bolts from his body, and can disrupt computer systems The Chase - Has boundless super speed and is really rich Allon The Strong - Is really strong. Durh Matt - A good hand-to-hand fighter Rourke - An elf that's good with knives and a bow  And there you have it. You mess with me, you mess with them!!! -Nod

      359. That's how many Canadians died on June 6th, 1944, trying to fulfill the mission perameters of Operation Overlord.  8:12 AM, members of Queens Own Rifles squadron are the first to land on codenamed Juno beach. Like so many others to storm the beach, they find themelves running into a hail of bullets from virtually untouchable German machine guns. Out of the 900 men, 541 survived the initial assault to take out the anti-air defense further inland, and then capture an airport that was to be used to launch bombers far into German Occupied Paris and Berlin. Just thought you'd like to know... Oh, and Carmen's gone. Went to Montreal, just like Julia... Seems we're all being drawn down there by Julia's tales of boundless debauchery and poutine fries. And burgers with mayonaise... The freaks... Further news, Pitt Meadows Day is tomorrow. The weather forecast is iffy - predicting rain sometime in the afternoon. But the Fun Forecast calls for 100% chance... of FUN! Shutup. They can't all be good. -Nod

      Well, here within the library, I sit. Yesterday, at the end of the school day, I left EXS with the teacher yelling down the hall at me because I was supposed to be in detention. How fortuitous, then, that today, the one day of the week I would have to bear TWO HOURS with her, she should be absent, and the lovely Miss. Fenn should take her place. (Miss. Fenn also let me go to the library because I told her I loved her and was overfilled with joy that she should be here on this glorious and sunny day) Yesterday was also an exceptionally good day fo adventuring. It involved more baseball, an armed Shiek guard, an elephant-skin drum and, most importantly, Thomas Haney Secondary School. I'll tell you the adventure later, as I have it all written out in a conversation to Kelsey in the MSN logs... And why bother typing it twice? Long story short, I blame Jess for everything bad that happened, and she now owes me four hours of my life, three quarters and a dounut. Oh, and due to the all-around reaction to my previous post of baby skins and evil - I'm not really a Necromancer. Nor do I REALLY have a baby skin cloak. Happy? You've ruined the magic. -Nod

      Alright, many have asked about my dream wherein I (and my league of Super Heroes) saved Kelsey and her family from a ship full of pirates. So, in an effort to appease the masses, here you are. Enjoy.  So, there I was at home. When suddenly, the phone rang. It was Kelsey on her boat! She said she'd been captured by pirates and were being held for ransom! But, she contiuned, saying that once they received the ransom, the pirates were going to kill her and her family just for the hell of it! So, I blew on a conch horn that resounded throughout the nine worlds, and assembled together my might band of Super Heroes! Andrew, the Wise Adam, The Electric Kid Allon, the Strong Chase, The Chase And those without titles - Matt, Rourke, Krystal, Amanda, and Carmen. We all hopped on Amanda's boat (it was a little crowded...), and sped away into the sunset. We soon came upon them, and one of the pirates had a gun to Kelsey's head! He spoak in a thick, German accent, 'Giff us zee money or zis leetle girl vill be killt!' So I turned to Rourke and took his bow. I took an arrow and attached some string to the end of it, then let it fly! Fly it did, straight through the head of the German pirate. He dropped dead, but was suspended by the rope that stuck to the mast behind him. We used the rope to climb up, and Carmen and Amanda got the Wests to safety onboard Amanda's boat before the fight began. Chase was first up, super fast as he is, and he ran around pulling the pins on grenades that some of the pirates had.  Andrew levitated himself up, and lifted a life boat with his mind, throwing into a crowd of gaping men. Allon swung himself up, just as one of the pirates raised his assault rifle. The man shot him three times, and Allon just laughed, ran over to him, lifted him with one arm and threw him into six of his friends. The fight had really picked up when the rest of us got on, and immediately one of the pirates seized Adam by the the throat. Adam looked into his eyes, smiled, and sent a current of electricity powerful enough to kill five elephant through the man. Rourke leaped on deck, shooting arrows with deadly accuracy as Matt and Krystal followed, bladed gloves on, ready to engage the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. I leaped on board last, after Kelsey and her family got saftely off the blood drenched ship. But, right when I got on, a shotgun toating pirate blasted me backwards. I wasn't killed, fortunately I was wearing my chestplate, but I was knocked clear off the boat. With my axe and my armor weighing me down, I slowly sunk to the bottom. Luckily, Carmen saw me and dove swiftly through the icy water to retrieve me. She hefted my onto her shoulder, and swum back to the surface with such force that she leaped clear out of the water and threw me back onto the deck. I lifted my axe, ready for battle, and charged. Andrew had run out of lifeboats to throw around, so he settled on lifting men and throwing them at eachother or off the boat. Adam stood and the bow of the ship, firing off lightning bolts to protect Chase lying beside him, who had been knocked unconcious by one of the grenades. Allon was badly wounded, having been shot thirteen times (don't worry, he doesn't die easily) so Amanda got him off the pirate ship and onto her boat where she bandaged him up. Rourke was standing in the crows nest, shooting off arrows when he spied a singled out target. I looked around for more enemies to kill, but saw instead Krystal and Matt, fighting bravely against the pirates that surrounded them. I hefted my axe and charged at the pirates penning them down. I swung wide, and my axe got at least five of them. I knocked one to the ground by head butting him, and, looking up, I saw there were no more pirates to fight! We slowly withdrew, most of us cradling heavy wounds (I'm pretty sure a couple of my ribs were broken) back onto Amanda's boat. We went back into harbour, and the team went back to whatever they were doing before I'd summoned them. I hung around with Kelsey for a bit, and we went to go see Aliens Vs. Predator because her sailing trip had been cut short :D  A pretty cool dream. Awesome fight scenes. I loved it when the guy grabbed Adam and Adam just smiled, his eyes glowed white, and the guy goes flying across the ship, blasted back by a zillion volts of electricity. I also found out Amanda has the Super Power of Healing, and Carmen can breath underwater. Aww... Man. I can't believe she's leaving. Kelsey, that is. Not Carmen. Although, Carmen  is  going down to Montreal again soon, I think. No, I mean Kelsey. Oh well, she'll be back soon... Ish... Not really at all, but with all the postcards I expect (and I do expect alot of postcards), it won't be all  that  bad... I guess... -sniff- Sigh... I'm going to go for a run with Mishka-mish. Oh, I assembled a weird tenty-thing in the back and moved furniture when I wasn't in my room brushing up on my Tae Kwon Do skills. Just, y'know, to keep you up to date. Bye now. -Nod

      Talkin 'bout the Lord of the Dance, that is. Micheal Flately is his name, and man can he dance like a sweet zombie Jesus! I watched the video of it at Krystal's house after cleaning out her garage/soon to be bedroom. It was fun, I moved a fridge, a freezer, and a whole wacka bucha hella stuff. Hella heavy stuff. Like only&nbsp;a man could lift. A manly man. A strong man. With a hairy chest. And flowing, golden hair. Sorry, but I needed that masculinity fix. Y'know, after Kelsey paid... PAID!!! Not that I'm obsessing about this thing... Because, really, I'm not. Well, unless you define obsession as a compulsive preoccupation with a fixed idea or an unwanted feeling or emotion, often accompanied by symptoms of anxiety. Thank  you   urlLink dictionary.com . Maaaaan... Krystal's mom's so funny. I lurve her to pieces. He he he... We were moving some mirrors (me'n Krystal), and her mom comes in and says, "Well, where d'you want'em?" And Krystal was like, "Oh, well, maybe I could put them on the walls to open up the room." And her mom said, "Aw, nuts. I was gunna put them above the bed in my room!" Mortifying. For Krystal, anyways. I laughed myself into a conniption fit of internal bleeding. Anyway, I'm gunna find some way to keep myself busy. How? I don't know. But I'll find some obscure way. Maybe eat some grapes. Maybe walk the dog. Watch some T.V. Play some computer games... Go for a bike ride, take up smoking and see if it's really that hard to quit, continue watching 'Will and Grace'. I dunno, wild night... -Nod

      That's right. Kelsey. Adam. Andrew. All jumping OFF the good ship "S.S. Tom". Julia's always been  way  gone in her Starcraft game. Amanda's left me to hang out with Mitch more often, Julie's in El Paso... Or Halifax, same thing. Oh, wait, Krystal's finally home. I'm going to help her clean out the ooooold garage tomorrow. You know, flaunt my manly man muscles. Of course, compared to Krystal's arms -&nbsp;I'm a little girl with osteoperosis. Anyways, speaking of Kelsey (scroll up. Top of the first paragraph. Second scentence, third word. There, see?! We  so  were talking about Kelsey. And you had the audacity to question me...  ME !!) I popped by her house today and we watched a cooooool movie with Sean Bean in it called "Equilibrium". It was good, but they killed off Seanie B. pretty quick. Some cool fight scenes, though - Showing you sometimes guns are better closer up than furhter away. Her friend Ana came by and watched Drew Carrey. She seemed cool. We ate some home-made, low-phe chocolate ice cream :D it was goo-ood. Ana left, and me'n Kel went down... Uhh... Burard? I forget the name of the street. We got some vege-sushi. It was pretty decent, but I reeeeally have to develop my disgraceful inability to wield chopsticks. Her laughter burned wholes the size of quaters in my ego center, and... OMG!!! WORST PART!!! She... She... She... SHE PAID!!!! She's not alowed to pay! That's why I worked my ass off for four hours for some smelly cowboy on Monday! So I'd pay! It killed my manliness. Honest to God. I have no manliness left. My penis  was  18 inches long. And three feet... Around. Now it's down to a piddling 7. All your fault. Oh well, other than THAT... Incident... The day was awesome! The pet shop's pretty cool, but some of those fish gave me the willies... And not in a good, Las Vegas way. Next time we go out, Kel, I'm paying. And we're eating someplace ritzy. Like... Whitespot :D Unfortunatly, that won't be for some time... She's leaving for 3 whole weeks come Sunday.  -sniff-. Oh well, she says she'll send me lots of postcards and call me on our one month (which is ironically the day she get's back, the 21st of August). Before I left her to her evil workey place, we talked about dreams we'd had recently. Her's, she said, she came home from her sailing trip to find out I was dating... Dun dun dunnn... Someone ELSE!! Ooooh... You don't have to worry about that, Kel lol Mine was much better. It had pirates and me and all my super hero buddies were in it, using their powers :D. After that, I kissed her g'bye, had a good jog down to the bustop and enjoyed a luxurious ride home with my favorite newspaper. I can't believe Adam and Andrew are going away, leaving me at the mercies of a cruel and uncertain future. You bastards!!! On a related note, I saw the 'Bourne Supremacy' with Adam the other day. Good movie. Goooo-ooood movie. A little less action than the first, but cooler. And a little sadder. That's all I'm saying. That and... NOOOO!!! HIS WIFE GOT SNIPED IN THE&nbsp;BACK OF THE HEAD FIFTEEN&nbsp;MINUTES INTO THE MOVIE BECAUSE THE SNIPER THOUGHT IT WAS BOURNE WHO WAS IN THE DRIVERS SEAT!!!! AAAAAAAAH!!!! *ahem* -fixes tie- Anywho.

      Well, this was a huuuuge weekend in terms of things happening. First and most important, Kelsey figured out who NG, the girl I told her I had a crush on, was. Long story short, we're now going out :D  She came down friday, and I showed her around Pitt. We saw Spider man 2 (most awesome movie), had some Caesar salad, went to Julia's where we were ignored, went to Andrew, where we went to Julia's and were no longer ignored. We played some Halo and then Kel'n I headed back into Vancouver. Fortunatly, I didn't need to go all the way, because her dad picked her up at the Burrard Sky Train Station. Not that I wouldn't have minded bussing with her all the way home, but... Things can get dicey that late when you commute.  Saturday, Me, Andrew and Amanda got hugely lost and ended up walking for hours. Needless to say, there was heroism and water-getting on my part, neutrality and indecisiveness on Amanda's part, and cowardity and weakness on the part of Andrew... Turn back? Jeeeeezus Christ, man!  Sunday.... Is today Sunday? No? Damn. Alright... What did I do yesterday... Oooooh yeah, I saw King Arthur with Adam. It was daaaaaamned good, if you haven't seen it already, go. Go now, or.... Well, or die.  And today I cleaned some cowboy's log cabin up on 250th. He wasn't home, but his dogs and axes and guns and hats and boots were. And that told me aaaaaall I needed to know about this interesting hombré. Really nice property, too. Fences and pastures and rolling, tree lined mountains.&nbsp;Three dogs had he (all very cuddly and nice), in addition to his several sheep and two horses.  Soon, I'm going to go see "I, Robot" with me old pal John. Like, really soon. Eeek! Ok, five minutes. No sweat.  -Rushed Nod

      Seriously. Best song... EVER. Weird Al Yankovich does a bunch of cover samples from popular songs like "Get down with the sickness" with a polka beat! It's soooooo fuuny :D But -ahem- that's just me. Almost done my book, "The Wayfarer's Redemption". It was good, I thought. And I think it's the first of a series... So, that'll be interesting. Morgan's left, his dad came home, and he left me 'Return to Castle Wolfenstein' and 'Warcraft 3' both very good games, I do declare. OOOOOOH MAN!!! I just remembered. These painters came today to do our living room, and they asked me to pull out the car so they could pull in their truck. There was two painters -&nbsp;one of them was a middle aged guy, and the other was his daughter, I'm assuming. Looked about twenty something with blond hair. So, I hopped in the corrola and they stood on either side of me while I backed out. Everything was going well untill... CRUNCH. I looked over at the woman, and she had her hand over her mouth and was completely horrified. I 'apparently' hit their truck, and 'apparently' this is a bad thing. Oh well, I'll just ride it out. Too bad about it. I just kinda go out, looked over at them, mumled something about my dog and ran into the garage where I hid for a while. I lifted up a garbage bag and it leaked on me -vomit- eeeew... Last night I went to Julia's with Morgan, played some Halo (warthog wars!), went to Andrew's, left Morgan there and went to Erin's, where she DIDN'T fix my hat. Went back to Andrew's, left with Morgan to go home. Mogan's dad picked him up, and I went down to Mitch's to hang out with Erin and Julie. Oh, Mitch was there too. But to a much lesser extent. Well, I'm gunna go finish my book. Axis just found out his father and mother are still alive! But, just as he met his cousin for the first time, his cousin was KILLED by Lord Bourneheld, evil half-brother of Axis himself. Adios. -Nod

       Oh.   Wow.   Colours   and   fonts.   You  definitly  don't get those everyday. Actually, maybe I'll use the Italic from time to time, so as to more accuratly describe my sarcasm. As it is, my sarcasm and wittature can go almost damned unnoticed on the occasion! And it stings like a bitchy bitch...   Anywho, I got two different offers to go camping this weekend, but I couldn't go. Ironically because Morgan didn't want to go camping and needed a place to stay. Which is alright, because although that is my one real goal this summer (to go camping, that is), I don't see Morgan as often as I used to. Plus, he brought over the box set of Family Guy. Saw Phenomenon last night. John Travolta's wandering around drunk after his birthday party and gets struck by a bolt of light. Suddenly, he can absorb knowledge really easily, and reads eight books a day. He becomes really smart, developes the ability to move things with his mind, and accidentally cracks a code for the CIA. The FBI comes after him, but they eventually let him go because he didnt actually do anything wrong. Eventually they discover he had a malignant tumour in his brain and, although it was killing him, it also awakened most of the parts of the brain we're not using. Unfortunatly, it still was killing him. So, he died. The end. I like it. There was one line when Travolta was talking to some scientist and he was getting all frustrated when the doctor called him a fluke or something. John was like, "No, no. I'm not a fluke. It's a fluke what's happening to me, the tumour, but all my differences and powers... That's the potential. That's everyone's potential to be this way, when they someday use all of their minds!" Well, I didn't quote it well, but you get the picture. -Nod

      Another dream, in case you're trying to avoid these things as long as possible...  So I was at my grandparents on the island and was assembling lawn furniture, when who came out of the door but Jenna Shepard. She told me she was here along with Matt, Trevor and Natalie, and that they were staying at my grandparents house for absolutely no reason that would make sense now that I'm good and concious. I was installing a garbarator, when Jenna and them decided it was time for a walk. So, walk we did, right into a foggy forest. I got seperated from them, and came out of the forest at a twin rinks. I went inside, and there was a junior girl's hockey game going on. So what did I do? Grabbed a stick, strapped on some skates and jumped in there. I scored the winning goal and I took out at least five little girls before I got kicked out. So I left. I met up with Jenna, Matt, Trevor and Natalie a while later, and we returned to my grandparent's house. No sooner had we returned, then a boy came to our door. He said, "To arms, it's war! We need the Elite Guard!" Suddenly, I was on one of those amphibious troop deployers like they used on Saving Private Ryan. Adam, Andrew and Chase were beside me, and we were all in full armor. I had a shield and an axe, Adam had two bows (I don't know how he used them...), Chase had a Samurai Spear and Andrew had a scythe. The boat deployed us, and we were on the top of a valley. We looked down at the rest of our army, and ran down the hill into the pit of the valley. The king shouted to us, "There's my Elite Guard! Come, stand up front with your king!" Strangely enough, the king looked and sounded in every way like Christopher Walkin. That was cool, because, hell, I'd follow that man into the pits of hell anyways. Plus, we got front row tickets to a war :D Suddenly, we saw our scouts running back from the hill. Behind them were our foes... The Southrons from Lord of the Rings! Adam, Chase, Andrew and I met them head on, and I killed at least four. It was really graphic, too. Like, Killbill kinda blood. Suddenly, four enemy soldiers came up with arrows in their hands, and they threw them at us! I had my shield out, and Adam and Chase must've been fast. Andrew, however, got an arrow to the neck, and fell into my arms. I carried him to the side lines, and dropped him by the medical tent. The HUGEST guy followed me and started thwacking me with a club. I kept hitting him with my axe, but it would cut him. So, I just hit him a bunch of times in the head untill he fell down unconcious. When he fell, who jumped up finsihed him with her spear? Kelsey. Woo! Me and her ran back to the frontlines. Suddenly, their emperror came out, with a guard of TROLLS around him! There's Adam, firing off his two bows (still... How?), and Chase, dancing around them and jabbing with his spear. I put up my shield and drive at the nearest Troll. He goes down with a couple axes to the legs and belly. With that Troll out of the way, I go straight for their emperror. But, right when I get there, he gets impaled by Kelsey's spear. -sniff-. Stupid Kelsey, always taking my glory... Oh well. We won, and we got a big pep-talk by our king. Andrew died in the medical tent, and Trevor and Matt were executed (sorry guys) for deserting the army before the battle. They WERE going to execute Kelsey, too, for obvious reasons (ever see the disney movie Mulan?) but, they didn't because she was a big hero and killed the enemy emperror. Aw... It was fun, I've gotta say. Plenty of gore, but other than that, pretty awesome. -Nod

      So, I woke up at around five ish, groomed myself, ate some of those crappy bran flakes, and headed out the door. I reached the train station at around seven and had a lengthy conversation with the guard there who informed me of how to put my bike on the trains, and other such good informational stuffs. 7:23 sharp the train arrived. I went to the nearest car, two bikes already. The next one down also had two bikes, and as I was running to the last car, the doors shut and the train started moving! As it passed me, though, the doors opneed and I threw myself and my bike on. The train ride over was pretty much uneventful, I read basically the entire time. One thing I couldn't help noticing was the different smells coming from each stop. Pitt Meadows had the normal smell, Coquitlam was the same, just a little more carbon minoxide. Port Moody reeked like a hairy ass, and so did Vancouver (but less so, and the reek was covered by the beautiful smell of the sea). So, I ride out through the station (on my bike... he he he) and up the busy street of Seymour. I'll say one thing for the people there, they're brave as all get out. I mean, if I saw me barreling down a street coming right at the other me, brakes screaming and jacket flying... I'd, y'know, make some action to move out of the way. Or acknowledge the fact my physical life was in danger. But, hey, whatever. Went from Seymore straight onto a really big and winding bridge, with an incredibly small pedestrian zone that had not seperator between the cars and the walkers, and NO SPACE TO SHARE... It was kind of unnerving, but I got through it ok. The sea breeze was nice and refreshing, so I took off my jacket and rolled up my sleeves to rid myself of that damned farmers tan.... Something I did not accomplish. One weird thing about 7th avenue which was odd is that it ended at a park or a school several times, and I found myself having to hop a fair many fences and running up some park hills to continue down the avenue itself. Same with Dunbar, although it was much... Uh... Hilly-er. And there we more parks. I phoned Kelsey from a payphone on Dunbar. Neither her, nor I expected myself so early, but she said it was fine and that I could just come on down. Her's would be the house with the door open next to the bright yellow house. Eventually I got to 24 W and headed right. I passed by her house before noticing that it was the one I was looking for. I have to say, I had a good time. After deciding we probably weren't going to be able to see a movie (as the soonest matinée started at four, and I had to catch a train by six), we walked down some streets, passed her school, went into the harbour and hung out on her boat. We talked about her sailing mishaps and other stuff, then walked around a little more. We went into the Chevron and I got a drink, then we headed back to her house, deciding that we would watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre. All I have to say is, "Meh." I mean, it was basically a Jason movie with more gore. The characters and the plot were both predictable as hell, the only kinda jumpy parts were when you saw a silhouette run across the camera. Those were never expected. Kelsey was scared, though. He he he... I'd be watching it, and out of the corner of my eye, I'd see her jumping around on the sofa or putting her hands on her face. She should see The Blob. That movie freaked me out when I was little. After the movie, we took her dog Kayra (or something along those lines) for a walk. It was nice, the forest was cool, the fields were well kept, the bog was dry and the dog was reeeeeally well trained (envy). When we got back, her brother came in and made a nutty, sprite milk shake thing and started playing FFIX on the Playstation. Kelsey got some frozen blueberries (yum :D) and we sat down on the porch and chatted for a while. Eventually, and with the dog's help, we finished the berries and headed downstairs, where I got the grand tour of the basement and we played a game of pool. As I was destroying Kels- I mean... As the game was almost over, we just started playing a game of Kelsey's own design called 'Pool Hockey' or something like that. The object of the game was to put your balls (you were either stripes or solids) into the holes on the other side of the table, and stop the person on the other end of the table from getting their balls in your holes. It was fun, but resulted in many crushed fingers all around. After all the balls were basically thrown from the table, we cleaned up and went upstairs, where she saw my babyskin jacket and I wowed her with my violin talents. Of course, she wasn't THAT wowed, because she's much better than me and is still taking lessons. After that, I headed out, took (basically) the same route (even though I had to stop at EVERY SINGLE FRIGGIN LIGHT BACK)to the station. Got there with some time to spare, so I bought some pretzels and sat down to read. The train came and my pretzels and I (and my bike, of course) all went on the train. Arrived home home at around... 6ish, ate some salad, took the dog for a run in the park in the dark, watched some of the movie "Cold Mountain". All in all, a very good day. Lots of fun. Now I'm out the door to play some tennis with Andrew and Adam, bye! -Nod

      I'm nervous. Nervous as all hell. I've only ever ridden the train once, and that was with many people coming in with me, and no bike. Tomorrow is quite the oposite. Just me, full of bike and packsac (Oh, by the way, I've decided bussing down would be too much of a hassle) I've got so many options to get down there, I might just take the sea wall! 7.82 miles, however many kilometers that is. I think it's around 11... Which is alright, about my house to 242nd (for those who know Pitt geography) I'm catchin either the 7:23 or the 7:53 train out there... I'll phone when I hit W 16th avenue, if there's a gas station or something there, should be around 10ish. This is going to be the greatest adventure of all time. And, if I die (probably because of the harsh city air...), I also put this on my blog (because it was in dyer need of updating) so that generations to come will know of my heroism and bravery. This is Thomas. Signing off. -Nod

      Ahhh... What an adventure today! And normally, planned adventures don't go over so well. This one wasn't even the eventful, not until almost the end... But we'll get to the when we get to that now, won't we? So, Andrew and I set out at a little after two, with one goal in mind - Reach the mountains! We biked down Harris (northwards) untill it ended, and our passage was halted by two flowing rivers. We then sat on a bench and ate some food to plot our next course. We decided westbound was the wildest route, and might just get us to the mountains we longed for. We biked on westward untill our gravel path veered to the south. It then doubled back (and so did we, of course) in an easternly direction. By the river, it was so weird, it looked like a bayou in New Orleans. House boats moored, weird water structures... Swamps. Anywho, it appeared we'd doubled back on ourselves, and we cam up on Pitt River again, so we bike along the dikes (eastwards) until we hit a paved road. We followed this, turned acouple times, and ended up on a broken road going north and heading into the vagina-like section of the mountains. We were soon completely surrounded by the things (mountains) and we discovered we had accomplished our original task of finally reaching the mountains themselves. We stopped where the road turns to Pitt Lake, and discovered to our dismay we were both out of water. So, we made a quick stop at a swamp... Unfortunatly, we both found the stagnant water there a little "sub-par" for our tastes and pressed on in a southernly direction, back home. Lo and behold, did we come across a sign reading "Swan-e-set Golf Course and Country Club". Surely, I thought to myself, there must be many a water to be found there! But, Andrew, pessimistic as ever, was not fond of the idea. And, to my eternal shame, as we neared the Club House itself, he turned AWAY from adventure for fear of reprecution! I asked, as he turned from me, if he would like me to fill his water bottle. And so he put his bottle in the back of my packsac and I set off for the palace itself. (this is the best part coming up, by the way. So if you were only skimming the storyline so far, you should now probably snap to attention and really read) I assesed the situation as I put down the kickstand of my bike and left it next to the golf carts. Really fancy was this place, I felt like some dirty scruffy human wandering around and elvish castle. Very out of place was I, given the sign said "Appropriate Dress Required". The girl behind the reception desk from whom I asked directions to the nearest source of water, the girl in the chef's outfit telling me exactly were the bar was, even the girl behind the bar... Were all drop-dead gorgeous. I asked her, "Could I use water pitchers, ma'am?" she looked up, smiled and said, "Of course, help yourself." I pulled out my two water bottles (well, one of them was Andrew's) and she laughed a little before saying, "Go ahead, fill them up. Less glasses for me to clean, right?" So I did just that, thanked her again and headed towards the doors. I was stuck walking behind three young girls I assume were around twelve. One redhead, brunette and a blonde. I overheard their conversation, and this is how it went. The blonde girl said, "We should go pick some berries by the path," the bunette said, "Yeah, they smelled really nice on the drive over," (by this time, we'd both exited through the door) and the redheaded girl points to my bike and said, "Why don't we just take that bike?" Well, I walked right through them, sat up on my bike and looked at them with a smile. "Please don't," was all I said with a smile. They looked completely embarressed, and just stood their as I tipped my hat and rode off. I eventually met up with Andrew, who was waiting for me at the gate. After filling Andrew in on the adventures he missed and handing him his cool, refreshing elvish water, we headed off. We stuck mostly to the main road until it hit Harris, and after a huge wait at the lights (well, I would've just gone, but I was waiting for Andrew who was a light behind because I'm such a great friend and would never LEAVE a friend), I headed home, got some money, went to the shell, bought some juice, and came home. And here I am now, believe it or don't. -Nod

      Cool dream. Coo-ool. I just woke up (12:30 ish) and... Aw man. Very cool.  So, I lived in my house with my two sisters and my mom, and my mom was going to the okanagan. We lived on the same street we do in real life (Davison Road, except my old violin teacher (Florence) lived at the end of the street, and down Harris Road where Harris Park would be, was a massive canyon and wilderness we called "The Mile".  My mom left, and I said to myself, "Y'know, I'd really like to take up the violin again." So, I picked up my case and walked to Florence's. Along the way, my violin changed into a bow and arrow, and I guess I just accepted this random change and moved on. When I got there, she was all excited her number one archery pupil had returned to her, and she set up a practice session right away, to take place in the heart of The Mile. So, as she gathered supplies, I wandered around her house... I guess I kinda got lost, because when I saw the entrance again, all there was was her daughter (who looked suspiciously like Go-Go from Kill Bill, thanks Julia) who said she'd already left and would be waiting for me there. I set out, and walked up Harris Road. You know where the Langley Farm Market and the Old Rec-Center is now? Well, in my dream, instead of a parking lot, there was a winding garden path with an orchestra playing along it. I asked one young flutist, looked like the where-wolf chick from Ginger Snaps 2, you know, when she was hot? I asked her whether this path led to The Mile. She replied in a no-nonsence tone, "Yes. And you DEFINITLY don't need anything to pass through the portal." After that, I backed away slowly and pushed on. I forget what song the band was playing, but it was rather nice and it set the mood. I finally reached what I could only guess was the portal that girl talked about. It looked ancient and magic and a blue, fluid substance filled and danced around it. I stepped in, without fear, and instantly I was racked with pain. Crazy seventies transitional screen later, I stepped out into a bar. Not just any bar, mind you, but the bar from the game Resident Evil: Outbreak. So, I grabbed a shot-gun and went to town. Killed all the zombies in my sight, saved the aspiring blonde news anchorwoman (stupid selfish Andrew) and went BACK through the portal. After being racked by pain AGAIN and seeing nothing but magical heavy blue stuff, I emerged in what I expected the middle of The Mile's canyon would look like. Rocks, trees, canyon walls on either side. Standard stuff. Oh, and Florence was there, screaming at me. No, not at me, but at the giant snake/fish (I'll just say half eel) woman who had my in her grasp. We fought it for a while and pushed it back through the portal. She looked at me and said, "Don't you have your Moonstone!? Without your Moonstone when you go through the portal, you could end up anywhere! And all the devils and angels and everything in between can see you and hitch a ride on you to our reality!" She lectured me for a while longer (I just tuned her out) and we begun to practice archery. After the sun went down, I went home and kinda chilled there for a while. The next day, there was this Tournament taking place in The Mile, and so I brought me and my super-hero team (Adam, Andrew, Allon, Chase, Matt, Rourke) and also my sister, Haley (armed with an assault rifle/grenade launcher) to enter. We were pitted against The Avengers (the Marvel Comics answer to D.C.'s The Justice League, The Avengers had in it Captain America, The Hulk, Thor and several others). Nothing really happened until my sister and a female version of Thor were put against each other in a virtual target range. The object was to hit the targets, but Thor-woman kept throwing her hammer at Haley. In response, Haley shot her with a grenade, and she s'ploded. Now, not only did this kill She-Thor in real life, but it somehow also took out Captain America who was having a throwing knife contest with Allon at the time (Captain America sucked horribly, by the way. Kept hitting the top right corner of the board... I don't know why). So, we just kinda wandered off, and me and Adam entered in a race around The Mile (which, by the way, encompasses an area alot bigger than just a mile. That's just the tamed areas. The rest of it is wilderness and stretches on for a loooong while). Y'ever seen the movie Hidalgo? All the arabian racer guys were there, on their pure-bread horses. So was Adam, for some reason, robed in arabian garb on a horse. I was just on my bike... The race started. Adam and I stopped somewhere along the line to help some kid who got stuck trying to fix this grate to the sewers, and we all stopped at night by a bridge. Adam learned how to catch a fish by diving into the water with a rope by the one NICE arabian guy from the movie (Hidalgo, remember), and I (being a vegetarian and not eating meat like fish) ate some poisonous berries. I didn't know they were poisonous, but some random woman told me they were, so I made myself throw up by putting my fingers down my throat. It took a loooong time, like, ten minutes of trying. And I had to shove my fingers really, really far down there... Kinda freaky. For my braver (? no idea why) the random woman gave me 4 and a half blueberries. She HAD an entire bucket, but would she give me anymore? Nooooooo... The next morning, me and Adam got a headstart, and cheated by hopping on a train. We entered one of the carts, and it was like, old fashioned saloon-style poker. But, who was there? Andrew, Nick Quin and Julia... Dammit, Julia! The entire time you kept asking if we'd play Big Two instead...  Anywho, that's about where the dream ended, so I'll not take up anymore of your time. I also kind of dreamed about the end of Ginger Snaps Two, y'know, when the doorbell rings to the crazy girls house? I dreamed it was me, and I was all like, "I'm the greatest warrior in the land!" so she sets her were-wolf on me, and I tackle it and inject it with a serum that turns it back into a woman, completely cured. And then I taught the crazy little girl that what she did was wrong and she was completely cured of all insanity.  -brushes hands together- Done deal. -Nod

      Hey, titles would be a hella lot easier if I just keep putting "Live, From (Insert Current Location Here).... pt (Insert Number of However Many Posts From Last Changed Location).But, you all know me (unless you don't) and my 'Never Take the Easy Ways Out' spiel. Mowed Herr Uberholtz's yards today. Yes,  yards . As in 'More Than One'. Using a self-propelled lawn mower that was quite possibly possesed by Satan Himself or at least a Greater Daemon. Actually, the machine wasn't so hard to use once I knew how to use it. I still don't like the feeling of tools pushing or pulling me around, though. Give me a good push mower anyday, I likes the feel of complete control over machines... Ever since I saw movies like 'Terminator', 'I, Robot', and 'The Matrix'. Seriously though, something baaa-aaad's coming down the pipe involving machines taking over the world. And it's not go-anna be pretty. Mmm... I made the  biggest  sammich today... So big... Gaaaah... Like a loaf of bread but into two with stuff in the middle, that kinda hella big. Oooo, hey, I still gotsta go paint that there wagon. It was so good, though... -Nod

      The Germans, of course. Speaking of the Germans, I heard a very interesting story of our very own Herr Uberholtz. Apparently, he was the same age as my grandma during the Second World War (early teens) and Kleine Herr Uberholtz was on his way back from the market with sour crout for his mother. All of a sudden, he saw three Allied Bombers flying up the road behind him. He ran for a bit, then dived into a ditch just as they opened fire. He was unscathed, but the sour crout was split assunder. And his mother did scold him when he got returned home. Hm... Isn't that  convienient  for our old friend. Convienient that, instead of being a Nazi  soldier  at the time the world was at war, that he should be instead an innocent German boy with broken sour crout and the victim of Allied violence... I'm on to you, Herr Uberholtz!  Übrigens bin ich nicht wirklich rassistisch! Ich mag jene verrückten Deutschen aus Deutschland soviel wie den folgenden Kerl! Gerade versuchend, lustig zu sein, bitte nehmen Sie nicht Handlung!  See!? SEE!? I told you, I warned you ALL!!! -Nod

      Well well well well well now boys, today was abitty ticky now, wasn't it? Today was my first actual day of work, and I do mean 'Day'. Got up, had some toast and cantelope, and I went outside to shovel and cultivate Herr Uberholtz's back yard. Wasn't bad, I do like playing in muddy gravelly red rocky stuff that turns into cement. Actually, I did have fun because I had a lot of 'Creative Liscence' :D It's far from done, but I have another few days to finish, and I got a big enough chunk today completed that I need not fret. And fret I shalln't. After I returned auf den hause der Herr Uberholtz, I did many-an odd job for me ol' grampy. I shived gravel from soil, weeded the field, spread maneur and these weird white things, turned the field, mixed cement (by hand :D), cut steel pipes with a hacksaw and stuck them in the ground using cement AND cleaned out an old wagon I'm going to paint tomorrow. It was fun, I had fun. I really do love working, as long as it's work where I know what I'm doing, have lots of liberty doing it, and I can see a difference in whatever I do. And it has to be dirty and heavy :D Ahhhh...  Now I think I'm going to make myself a nice salad. I made enough cash today to pay off Hailee for her dog walking services she's providing over my little vacation here, so I might even make it out of here with a few pennies to myself. Hopefully enough to take out Kel somewhere nice, and maybe buy some new socks. I blew through 2 pairs today!!! -Nod

      Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee -gasp for breath- eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!! I went driving in my grandparent's neighborhood today, and I must say I ruled with an iron fist. I was fast, but smooooth, and I took the corners like a golden haired God of corner taking. I think the Aztecs had one called Huitzopoctli, but he wasn't golden haired. I think he was half snake, half bull. I don't remember now. Could have been half eel... Anywho, it's raining, so Herr Uberholtz hasn't asked me to do anything yet. I'm sure when he does, it'll probably be nicht besonders anyways. He he he... That's german, see? And so is he. Ahhhh... I'm so witty. Went into Courtney with my grandma today, and I got 5 pairs of new white socks :D!!!! Oh, and a cool light sweater. It looks like it's inside out, but it's not. Oh, it's not. I also found out what size my head was for hats. I was trying on cowboy hats, and I found out I had a large head. A  large   head. That hurts! I always considered myself a fairly aceraged sized headed man. More of a medium than anything else. Oh well, maybe it's all my curls... I guess I'll just have to live with a big hat... -sniff- Sigh... Still raining. Apparently, I'm still getting mail at home. :D thanks Kel. I got a postcard this time, and I'm talking to Jenna (my sister), trying to ask her if she'd type up what it says on it. I'll get her eventually. I tried to phone Kelsey last night, but I think she's out of range. I'll try again tomorrow. -Nod

      Woooeeey. Boy oh boy. Mushroom manure smells like a hella bad, I tell you what. Take it from me. And my once great boots. They're still great, mind you. Just smelly and great. So, my grandpa picks me up at around 11, and we shovel mushroom manure into his truck for the morning, then manage to be there VERY last ones to hop on the 12:30 ferry. The ride over was peacefull enough. I bought a vege wrap that was heavy enough to do arm curls with and I played this REALLY cool arcade game where you sat in a chair and shot at planes, but the chair MOVED when you looked around, and shook when you got shot and shot in turn. T'was most cool. The ride across the island was nice. I sure did forget how racist and sexist my grandpa was. Not in a bad way, mind you. Just in a "stuck in the 50's" way. Every two seconds he'd be like, 'There's another  woman  driver." Or something equally as offensive, but more racially inclined. He talked to me about some of the odd jobs he and his German neighbor had lined up for me. Apparently his German neighbors, Herr und Frau Uberholtz, live their day to day lives like clockwork. Down to the second. Takes their garbage out, walks their dog, goes out, come home... Same time, day in day out, every week. If I ever live that way, I want you, the reader, to end my life. Painfully. With Korean candies. I got a letter from Kel today, right when I was leaving with grandpa. He he he... She was really bored, so she decorated the envelope all crazily. With the craziness. I like it, it looks... Cool... lol Well, I'll be off. I'll update occasionally when I'm here. Bye now. -Nod

      The pain I speak of, mind you, is the intolerable pain of those damned Korean candies my dad sends us every so often. I don't know why I eat them. Possibly because they're incredible combination of crazy, sketched out designs on the wrapper is impossible for any man to resist. Erg... MERRRRMADON!!!! I can feel them shredding apart my intestinal lining like fireants carving a new colony for themselves out of wet clay! But I digress. Kelsey's gone, left Sunday. I phoned her Monday to leave a message on her cell, and she phoned me Tuesday to tell me her cell would be on until 9:00 PM. Unfortunatly, not only was I not there to receive said message, but I did not return untill 11:46 PM. Which, chronologically speaking, is past the time mentioned earlier. So, I left another message on her cell saying that Ana had left for Mexico, that I was going to the island for a bit come Thursday, and to have a good time. Oh? Didn't I tell you I was leaving for the island come Thursday? That's odd. You would think I would have told you when I first learned about it. Oh wait.  I am . I hate it when my mom does this, "Oh, by the way Thomas, you're going to your grandparent's house two days from now to help your grandpa in the garden." I mean,  come on ! It's not like I have any plans or I'm going to miss anything, but it's common courtesy! God... Learn some manners! Oh well, I like working in the garden, and I haven't seen grandpa Gordan or grandma Barb for the longest time. It'll be fun. Ahhhh... Oh man. I had the strangest dream last night. I went to Kelsey's house to pick her up for the movies, and her dad answered the door. Now, I've never seen her dad, but I'm just assuming he's  not  Christopher Walkin. Which he was in this dream. He answered the door and I said to him, "Is Kelsey home?" And he said, "Yes, hold on a second." So he walks away from the doorway, and I make as if to come in, and he turns around and goes, "No no no... You stay outside. With your keys out of your pockets, mister!" I step back a couple paces and, slowly, get my keys out of my pocket. "Hold'em up," He said, "Higher... There we go. Hold on, I'll go get her for you." So, I stood there, and Kel's brother, Doug, walked passed me and got into their car. Kelsey came and she's like, "Oh, so you met my dad." I put my keys back in my pocket and nodded. Suddenly, her dad appeared at the doorway! "Where are those keys?!" he demanded. I reached into my pocket and held them up high, standing straight. "That's right. You just keep it that way," he said, and got into the car with Doug. As he drove away, he shouted to me, "Where are those keys!?" And I shouted back, "Outside the door and up high!" And he said, "That's right! You just keep it that way!" And with that, he drove off. I went in and Kelsey's mom was painting some kind of room pink... And that was kind of the end. A very... Very strange dream. Why is it that when I don't know someone, they turn into a celebrity? Oh... Oh ho ho oh... My. I gotta lie down. I hate those goddamn candies. -Nod
