       for Horace     Flowers were blooming,  Voices were singing,  Clouds were looming,  My ears were ringing.  The night we danced  To a pounding beat  And we romanced -  I had sore feet.  I lent you money,  You bought me beer.  You called me "honey",  You yelled in my ear.  I gazed really deep  Into your eyes;  You fell asleep  Between my thighs.  And now we no longer  Go out any more.  I have grown stronger;  You've passed out on the floor.

       for Horace   We've been through this whole Big rigamarole - So why go through it again? You're telling me lies. Well, that's no surprise - But why go through it again? You don't avoid me, But our plans disagree - Why go through it again? I thought it was fine But you changed your line - Why go through it again? I'm left here alone And you're not going to phone - So why go through it again? It doesn't seem right; Me alone, every night - So why go through it again? You really can charm But it just does me harm - So why go through it again? I guess we agree We're both happy - Here we go through it again.

       for Wilhelm     The sun rises and so do I.  I look at you and want to cry.  Sometimes you can be so bad  And that is what has made me sad.  Often you are really nice -  That's a cheering-up device -  But not right now, for I am glum.  Sometimes you're a real bum.

       for Vincent     Like the rain falling gently,  The whisper of the leaves,  Your love flows through me  So I can hardly breathe.  The beams of the sun  Sparkle in your hair.  You're the only one  For whom I care.  A small pond of water  Glitters in your eyes.  You're lithe as an otter -  That is no surprise.  Your natural beauty  Is such a charm.  If you're good to me  I'll do you no harm.

       for Raoul   True love abounds when I look at you And often I think you can feel it too. The way that you treat me is special, I know, And no-one can take you away, Because your affection is all that you show Each minute and hour and day. Often they say that you're not very smart; I listen, but never believe. All I know is that you give me your heart So I've got no reason to grieve. I know you're committed, although not to me, But they say that's the best place for you to be. Some day I think it will all work out, So give me a call when they let you out.

       for Reginald   I stand on the bank of a little brook. I am not alone, but am afraid to look Into your eyes, for they might say That what I feel is for just today. You hold me close and do not speak. My breath comes quick; my knees are weak. You touch my hair with your woollen glove And whisper soft - this must be love.

       for Seymour   We played checkers for hours on end. I came to know you well. Actually, I might even call you a friend, But then, you never can tell.  You told me your entire family history: I listened to every word. Nothing about you remains a mystery Since everything I have heard.  There's one thing I can truthfully say And one can doubt it not: On that otherwise uneventful day You sure told me a lot.

      Slimy pianosamba and cocktails with umbrellas - the pale clouds of skinny cigar smoke - blonde beehives and suspicious moustaches - this is the snakepit of closet writers. Wandering through mixed metaphors you must dodge dangling participles en route to split infinitives. Ah, there she is: the captivating blonde in a slinky sleeveless black dress, smoking an American cigarette in a mock tortoiseshell cigarette holder and brazenly sipping scotch on the rocks. Won't you join me at my corner table for cocktails and a modest dissertation on the perils of living on the creative edge?  I often find myself wandering in a pastoral meadow bordered by a gloomy forest, where tiny blossoms peek out on sunny days. The sky is blue with a lonely cloud, and frequently I encounter a babbling brook. Birds generally sing sweetly as I bask in the warm sunlight and contemplate the symbolism of butterflies. Some days I might venture into the forest, where crackling underbrush betrays the presence of a gentle doe or a curious rabbit. As the breeze rustles through the leaves overhead, I lean against a tree trunk and become one with nature.  On occasion, I find myself in the city, where it is usually dark and raining. Streetlights continually bathe the damp streets in a forboding orange glaze, and around every corner is a steaming sewer. Neon lights flash the names of half-deserted bars. There is rarely any other person on the desolate streets, although I often hear echoing footsteps or laughter.  Have I told you about my overbearing mother? Oh, well, that's another story.  My life is full of characters, each with his or her very own personal stereotype. There's Jim, the macho letterman who drinks lite beer because it tastes great and is less filling. There's Marie, the shy quiet bookworm who has odd obsessions, among them, butchering unsuspecting paperboys. There's Tony, the party boy who knows when to just say no and go study in the library. There's Jennifer, the bulimic rock singer. There's Arnold, the sensitive guy.  And of course, there's me. Do you know why I write? I write because I'm an arrogant bitch, and to pick up dudes. Have I yet mentioned my fat overbearing abusive mother who has an obsession with Catholic priests? Oh I'm sorry, I shouldn't burden you with my problems.  But I write because my psyche drives me to it. I embrace experience, I feel the vibes, I experience what society in general experiences, and the feelings fill me until I can no longer contain them. I empty myself onto the page, I bare my soul to face the world naked, I win friends and influence people. Sometimes I can feel a thought in my brain, and I just have to take it out and put it on paper. Then I can go on again with a fresh, empty mind.  Oh, I'm forgetting myself. I think I neglected to mention the credits for "Freezing" - you know, the third track on side one of the album "songs from liquid days" by Philip Glass? Suzanne Vega collaborated and Linda Ronstadt sang it. The Kronos String Quartet performed it and it was produced by Kurt Munkacsi. And his brother.  Sometimes I wonder if I have chosen right in desiring to be a writer. But then I remember how society has placed its burden on me, and that my vocation has been sent to me from a higher plane, it's in my soul, I've been predestined to write.  Oh gosh - I'm inspired! Please excuse me while I proliferate on this slightly damp cocktail napkin.  The pianosamba weaves a gossamer web over the lounge, and the chartreuse leisure suits make a fitting accompaniment to the misplaced modifiers and obscure allusions. The writers continue to wildly gesticulate, splashing cocktails and strewing umbrellas and ashes from skinny cigars upon the floor. This snakepit indeed exemplifies the perils of living on the creative edge.

       for Brian   "You're sweet," you said, "Your whole life rhymes." You may think so, but oftentimes I think you're wrong; and then again (As I scribble frantically with my pen) You could be right, so listen, then. My life, it rhymes with words like "beer" And "sex" and "drugs" and other cheer- y things like "cigarettes", "parties", "clubs", "Bands", and "bars", and "English pubs". So there you go, I guess you're right, And what appears as rather trite Is quite correct, and tried and true, And all reveal-ed, thanks to you.

      What a day it's been.    I thought we would make it to Sunday School on time, but then June called and asked if I could take her kids for her... so I did. No big deal, we were only 15 minutes late... if that. Sunday School and church went well, though. I didn't go to Wendy's afterward, because I took the kids home... then Katya and I had pizza at home for lunch.  Then just as I was getting her set for her nap - Mark brought a whole bunch of people over. So no nap for Katya, or for me. Oh well.  We watched Benny and Joon. That's a great movie.   I'm tired. What else is new?

      Today we went with a bunch of friends to the Jays game. That was pretty neat. Katya played at the little playground they have there for kids, and after the game she got to run around the bases. She loved that!  The Jays won, which was really cool, because of all the games we've gone to see there, they've never actually won. And the guy who won Canadian Idol sang the national anthem.   Katya and Mark are sound asleep on the couch. I think I'm going to take Katya up to her bed.   The fish in the aquarium look like they're happy. If fish can be happy. I changed their water yesterday.

      Katya is up late tonight. Well, she fell asleep at 4:30 and it was virtually impossible to wake her up - until she woke up crying at about 9:30. So she is (supposed to be) watching Monsters Inc. right now. Actually, she's standing here beside me, leaning heavily against me... OK, now she's gone back to watch her show. Just before I got really irritated with her.  Last night we saw Black Rebel Motorcycle Club in Toronto. It was a really good show. My husband Mark, and Ryan who came with us, got to go backstage after the show and meet the band. I am really happy for him. He got his record signed and everything, so that's cool.  I am very, very tired right now. Otherwise I would write more.

      I'm listening to Johnny Cash.    The house smells like burnt plastic - a lid from one of Katya's cups fell to the bottom of the dishwasher and melted on the heating element.   Mom came over today. We did some gardening. It felt good to do that sort of stuff. I wonder why I don't do it on my own?   I had an interview for a job last week. It was ideal for me - exactly what I would like to do in my life right now. The interview seemed to go really well, but I didn't get the job. I knew it, too, in the back of my mind. Whenever I have a really good interview, I don't get the job. Why is that? Maybe I didn't come across as being desperate enough. Oh well. I just see it as God's will that I don't have a job just now. I think maybe I need to get my own house in order before I am responsible to someone else, as well. It makes sense. I think it's biblical, too.  I need to burn some incense to get that burnt plastic smell out of here.  It's raining. I'm glad. I feel like it should rain.

      Children are wonderful, the way their minds work. My daughter, Katya, for example, can do all sorts of incredibly irritating things, and just when I'm at the point of exploding at her, she'll do something so amazingly cute there's no way I can be upset with her. Talk about manipulative - but in the most innocent way!  We had a good weekend... visiting with old friends. It's good to have people that still care about you, even when you've changed. I'm a much different person than I was when I first met Cora, but we are still good friends - even after 16 years. Wow... that is a long time.  Katya is watching Veggie Tales Jonah right now. She loves that show... along with various other shows. I know it's 10 after 9 and she should be in bed, seeing as she has preschool tomorrow, but she actually had a nap today on our way home from Toronto, so she's staying up late. She's wearing the fluffy pink robe her Grandma gave her. She looks like a little pink Yoda. She's about as smart as he, too.  Box of 6 muffins, buy one get one free at A&P tonight. Why do I find that exciting?

      It sure has been a while...  Katya was a flower girl for her Aunt Amy's wedding. Katya looked so sweet, I was so proud of her.  She had a lot of fun, but she didn't get a nap so she was very, very tired.  We saw Echo & The Bunnymen for the 4th time. It's totally worth it, every time. Ian is so amazing.   We didn't go see Spiritualized. We were just too burned out from the wedding the day before.  I got the brace for my right knee. I'm so happy.   I also have gone back on my antidepressants. Hm. Maybe that's why I'm happy.

      Wow. Here I live on this quiet street at the edge of town... and I just witnessed a high-speed police chase, right in front of the house.  A black SUV with a flat rear tire, chased by three cruisers - lights flashing, sirens blaring... The SUV smashed through a chain-link fence... kept going... absolute craziness... I have never in my life seen anything like it.  I wonder what it was all about.

      Mark was on his way to work tonight and he inexplicably ran out of gas. The tank was easily 1/8 full when he left home, but as he drove along he could see the fuel gauge drop. When CAA got there and put gas in it, the van wouldn't start. They towed it to the garage, and tried again, but it still wouldn't start.  He decided not to bother with going to work at that point.  What else could possibly go wrong?  I got a brace for my left knee today. It helps! I'm so happy... I can hardly wait to get the brace for my right knee.  I dread the upcoming weeks, only because it's so busy, and everything involves money: Saturday is Amy's wedding (we still have to buy a present); Sunday we go see Spiritualized; next Sunday we see Echo and the Bunnymen (I think it's the 4th time now) and there's all sorts of stuff going on in between all that.  I think maybe I'll just go to bed.

      Well, maybe not lonely, but whatever.   It has been well over a week since I posted. Mark's had the week off work, so I haven't been online as much.   We had the Norfolk County Fair this past week. It was great fun. The afghan I entered won 3rd place. So that's cool. Katya enjoyed going on rides.  We ate some really yummy food, too.  My birthday was this past Saturday. It was neat - we had a Steak & Cake party and then just had people over. Very casual, but nice.   And today was Thanksgiving. I ate too much, but that's typical for going to Mom & Dad's anyway.   This afternoon we went to Sand Hill. That was so cool, I haven't been there in ages, and it certainly seems steeper now - but that could just be me being older. It was really nice, though - a beautiful day for a beautiful view of the countryside and the lake. Katya really enjoyed it, too. She had lots of fun in the sand, making sand angels and just running and rolling around.  On the way back to Mom & Dad's we drove past our old house, the place where I grew up. It's weird - it looks basically the same, except all the trees are absolutely HUGE! I would really like to be able to go in there and look around.   Mark went back to work tonight. He got pulled over by a cop for speeding, but fortunately didn't get a ticket. However, he will probably lose his pay for Thanksgiving Monday, since he ended up being late. That's just stupid.  I've been watching all these Disney Princess movies with Katya, lately. They all have to deal with incredible evil... but somehow everything turns out absolutely fabulously for the girl. I wish things were that way in real life. Where is my fairy godmother?

      Today we went to the butterfly conservatory with Lisa and Claire. The girls loved it. And they got along really well, too, which was an added bonus. I'm glad that Katya has a female friend her age. It was really neat to see all the butterflies, too. Katya didn't want to leave, because it was so beautiful there (that's what she said).  And it was beautiful... but incredibly humid. I got some good photos, though. I also figured out more about how my digital camera works. So it was very good.  The weather this evening was more like a hurricane than when the hurricane went through.  Weather is so confusing.

      So I went out and bought myself a coffee grinder. No big deal, right? Well, of course, I'd told my mom that I wanted one for my birthday (next week) - and, being a good mother, she got me one. So now she's disappointed, and I'm feeling guilty. What else is new?  Katya decided to wear her cool stripey cords today. I'm pretty happy about that - she's getting into wearing pants, just in time for the cold weather. We have to leave in a few minutes for her to go to school. But right now she's playing with her Daddy. Which is very good.  It's October. I like that.

      I guess the only real solution for that is to actually blog a little more often.  However, my little world is incredibly boring. Really. Leaves very little to blog about. But let's see...  OK, well today we went to Zellers and had our photos done. One of the family and a couple of just Katya. That little girl just LOVES to have her photo taken. After the photographer was done, Katya just hung around and posed for a while. lol What a funny.  My Avon business has been doing relatively well, considering I've only just started with it. I'm so happy.  Oh yeah, Katya is now 3. She had a fun series of birthday parties. She loves getting presents - but not in a greedy way. She is very polite and gracious. After opening each gift, she plays with it for a bit, then goes and gives a hug to the giver. That was one of the sweetest things I've ever seen her do - it was completely unprompted. Made me feel very proud of my girl.  We are also on the way to getting out of debt. Or at least reducing debt. It feels good. I'm also cutting back on the use of credit cards, which also feels good.  Life could definitely be worse. I hope it doesn't get that way.

      It seems almost like Christmas came and I missed it. Katya's been sick. I've been sick. We just got up after spending approximately 20 hours in bed. We got up a little bit, but have spent most of the last couple of days sleeping.  Right now Katya is playing games with her Daddy. She got a lot of games for Christmas this year; I guess because most games seem to start at age 3. So now there's lots of fun stuff to do with her.  Today we missed going to Mark's aunt & uncle's near Windsor. It's been a very low-key Christmas. I can't remember ever missing so much. Oh well.  Last night we went to the Panorama in the park and Katya really enjoyed it. She made some snow angels and ran around for a bit. I think the fresh air was good for her.  I hope she starts feeling better now.

      Yes, sure enough... when we went to bed there was just the lightest touch of snow on the ground. But this morning we woke up to beautiful light puffy snow - and it's still coming down. It's just gorgeous!  We were supposed to go to my cousin's house in Guelph today, but Katya just isn't feeling well. So it is a quiet "little family" Christmas at our house. Mark made waffles with his new waffle maker. They were very tasty. He played with our new FRS radios a bit, and was talking to a kid somewhere down the street, I think. I guess somewhere within 2 km anyway. Kinda neat.  I hope that you - whoever is reading this - have a wonderful Christmas and enjoy your holiday time. Remember the whole point of Christmas is Christ. He should be the whole point of your life, and I hope He is. He is the whole point of mine. God bless you.

      It was sure a letdown, weather-wise. It was relatively warm today. If it weren't for the wind, it would have been almost balmy.  I now have an additional two gifts to wrap before Christmas. I did have everything done, but we added a couple of gifts today. Then that should be it.  Tonight is Mark's last night of work till January. It will be nice to have him home for a while. Although I'm sure I won't be online as much while he's here... we'll probably try to watch some movies. I know we're getting at least one for Christmas, plus we want to go see Return of the King, since we haven't seen it yet.  I think I need to increase my antidepressant dosage. Either that, or get more sleep. Or else eat properly. Hm... Oh well.

      Hello.  Once again, we did not win anything on the 6/49. Nothing on yesterday's Super 7, either. Oh well. At least we had a good time at the Loewen family Christmas party today. We got some cool gifts. Katya got an amazing Crayola colouring kit thingie from Cousin Emily. I got a cool little angel fairy thingie from Bethany or Robin. And Mark got a couple of great plaque-mounted photos done by Cousin Steve. They are really nice, and will definitely find a place in our "Gallery Of Artwork Done By Our Friends".  I really do like the whole Christmas thing. Getting together with family that you only see two or three times a year. Eating really good food. Giving presents - and receiving them, too. All the pretty lights and decorations. And of course the whole point of it is Jesus Christ's birth. I thought it was so cool, on Coach's Corner tonight, Don Cherry even said to remember that Christmas is about the birth of Baby Jesus. How neat is that?  The next few days are going to be the highlight of the year, I think - and not least because of Katya. It is so great to see how a 3-year-old child sees Christmas. She talks to Santa like he's an old friend. She loves the gift-wrapped presents under the tree, and tries to guess what is in hers. She always wants to decorate Christmas trees. And she's just so happy. I think I'm going to go colour some pictures with her.   Have a blessed Christmas.

      Katya is asleep on the couch. So was I, for a bit... but the call of freedom was too strong - freedom to do whatever I want without Katya wanting me to be with her. She always wants me within about 3 feet - or less - of her. And if I'm doing something, she wants to be doing it, too. Or else, she wants me to stop what I'm doing immediately and be with her. So it's nice to have a little break.  It's snowing again, lightly. The birds have almost emptied the bird feeder a second time. I'm still waiting to see if Katya gets chicken pox.   Only a week till Christmas. I can hardly wait!  Ah, Katya's up... Wow. That was quick. She laid down again and went right back to sleep. If only it were so easy for me...

      It is most definitely getting deep out there. The sander has been by, and the snow plow. It's really very pretty. It would be a perfect night to go to the Panorama - except that Mark has to play at Streetlight, and I have care group... Oh well. Maybe it will still be nice tomorrow.

      This morning when I got up, all my fishies were looking a bit pale. Not slimy white like ich, but lacking in colour. So I removed one of their fake plastic trees, and cleaned the other one... I changed their water and tried to clean up a lot of the crud from under the stones. Once the initial shock subsided, they appeared to be a bit happier. My angel fish is looking a bit brighter now. Not perky yet, but shoot - it ate two dead fish eyes yesterday, so what can one expect? I'm just hoping I don't lose any more fishies...  A happier thing greeted my eyes this morning, as well. We've got a couple of inches of beautiful snow, and it's still snowing! I know, it's a drag for people like my parents who are responsible for keeping walkways clear. And really, for anyone who has to go anywhere, like my husband going to work tonight. Even for going to church this morning, it's a hassle. But it sure is pretty! And it's nice to get it now that Christmas is only 10 days away.

      We were at a Christmas banquet tonight, and a lady was explaining stuffing to a guy who had recently arrived in Canada from England. She said to him, "There's nothing unusual in it." I commented, "No, only the liver and heart and stuff like that." I'm not really sure what she was thinking actually goes into stuffing.  The guest speakers for the banquet were great - they are originally from Russia and are now starting a Russian-speaking church in Toronto. They were very humourous and entertaining.  One of my fishies died today. A neon. It's weird, when it died, its blue and red colouring disappeared and it was just a pale translucent sort of white. And the angel fish had eaten its eyes.

      Katya had fun at school today. And this evening, Mark even spent some time with us, so that was nice.  I feel miserable... physically. My head is stuffy, my nose is stuffy, my eyes are stinging, my throat hurts, and I keep coughing up little gooey chunks of stuff. Oh well.  Somehow, I have a strange feeling that chocolate will help.

      Banks do not exist to help people. Banks exist to make money. They don't care about people, they only care about people's wallets and how best to empty them.

      I hate banks and anything that has to do with other people managing my money. Once again we get slapped with a $35 fee for being short a few cents for our mortgage payment. All because we paid our bills a couple of days early.   Not only that, but it pushes us back another 6 months to a year before we can request overdraft protection. It sucks, sucks, sucks.

      Just now, in my backyard, I saw a number of sparrows, juncoes, red finches and - get this - a red-breasted nuthatch as well as a downy woodpecker. Amazing!

      My face hurts. I was fine this morning, only a hint of the same cold I've been fighting for the past week or so. But this evening my sinuses got stuffy - and now they feel very unhappy. Like my cheeks are going to pop or something.  Katya was exposed to chicken pox yesterday. That means that she could be all polka-dotted for Christmas. I wonder if we can manage to get the entire family deathly ill by Christmas. What fun that would be.  I don't really mean that would be fun. But you probably realize that.

      I woke up this morning and looked out the window and was greeted by lots of snow. It certainly looked Decembery. And the beauty of it is - there's still snow on the ground tonight!  My Christmas lights look really pretty.

      We went shopping yesterday, and the first thing we did in the mall was buy Katya a Care Bear. That was well worth the price, though - she was so happy for the entire shopping trip - no whining or anything. I guess there's something to be said for bribery/spoiling.  I just drank a huge glass of egg nog. I'm not entirely certain that was the best thing to do right before bed. Well, it's not just the egg nog - the fact that I ate 3 Strub's pickles, too, could be contributing to my slightly unsettled tummy. Pickles and egg nog... what a great way to celebrate the beginning of December.  Tonight Katya and I watched Nightmare Before Christmas. I've been trying to get her interested in it all November... finally tonight she was open to watching it. She actually liked it, I think. Or she just liked cuddling on the couch with Mommy and was willing to do whatever it took to get me to sit there with her. I don't know. Anyway, Katya, Care Bear, Blankie and I watched the whole thing.  And now, with my tummy full of two foods that disagree with each other, I shall go to bed.

      It's cold. There is a lot of snow. It's windy.   I'm not complaining... But it is cold.  I am glad that I live here, though. Four distinct seasons. A cold, white winter. A wet, muddy spring. A hot, muggy summer. A colourful, comfortable autumn. You can't beat it. In my opinion, anyway.

      I'm still around and blogging... even though it's been a couple of weeks, I haven't forgotten.   Tomorrow we are having a Chinese student move into our house. Her name is Rita, and she goes to the local high school. It will be very interesting, and different, to say the least. But I am looking forward to her being here.   We have lots of snow on the ground now, but it's so cold out it's not even fun to go out and play. Needless to say, we've been spending a lot of time indoors. However, Katya spends much less time watching her videos now, and has begun playing computer games. She is learning so much! It's great to see.   In two weeks it's time to register Katya for junior kindergarten. I can't believe it's come to that already! Last night we watched the video from when she was born - the day before when I had a huge whale belly, and the afternoon of her birth day. She was so tiny and helpless.   Oh well, I suppose I needn't feel old. She's still just a little girl.

      We finally have enough snow of the right consistency. Earlier this week (Monday, actually) we built a snowman. It's been ages since I've done that. It was pretty fun. Katya was quite excited about it.  Katya's gone to my mom & dad's overnight. It's nice to have a break in a very quiet house.

      It's a nice evening. It's snowing madly and there's loads of it on the ground. I wonder if tomorrow will be a snow day. For years I didn't care if it was or not - but now, if it's a snow day, Katya doesn't go to school. So shall be life for the next 14 winters...  It was Sunday. A very regular Sunday. Sunday school, church - we did worship today - potluck afterward... It was nice, we sat with Jodi and Andrew, and I chatted with Jodi, and Mark chatted with Andrew and it was just really cool. Katya and their little girl Moira love each other, which is great. I feel really happy about our church family. I'm so glad we have it.  Tomorrow we have an appointment at the lawyer's office about refinancing our mortgage. We are finally getting around to managing our debts. That's a good feeling, too.  Life right now is good.

      There is snow outside, but it's sunny now. And cold. And windy.  Katya is full of energy and I'm not quite sure what to do. I suppose I should play with her. I think perhaps she is craving attention - and I just want to be alone. I guess when I became a mother I gave up my right to solitude.  One of these days I will clean up my house. Well, I should maybe say one of these weeks... as it will take more than a day to clean up the whole house. I would like to get started on organizing the basement, so that we can actually use it, even though it's not finished.   There's just so much to do.

      Or Happy New Year, whatever.  It's been good. Katya is feeling much better now, and it seems like she's trying to make up for lost time of having fun. Which, consequently, is wearing me out. Oh well.  Yesterday we finally saw The Return of the King. How amazing was that?! Other movies we've seen (rented or otherwise) have been Pool Hall Junkies, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and Bowling for Columbine. And the old standards, including Ice Age and Finding Nemo.  New Year's Eve was good - we went to our friends Chris and Sarah's and played games. We met at Swiss Chalet in Brantford for dinner, the whole group of us, and then to their house. It was nice to actually celebrate the occasion instead of staying home sick, as I had the past few years.  Only a couple more days of "holiday". Then Mark goes back to work, and Katya is back to preschool on Monday.

      I got an anonymous letter in the mail today. I thought I would post it online so that the coward who couldn't sign her/his name to it would know that I received it OK.  It was addressed to "Mrs. Medinets".   You 2 are the wackiest people around. Every one feels sorry for your daughter because she has such strange parents. You might think it is cute but some day she will be embarrassed by you, other people won't want their kids to play with her (because of you), others will slot her into a category (negative) because of you. . ...think about it . . ..she will be held back and not free to be herself because of the way you want to look and act. It is not normal to hang around with people half your age, to dress like a teenager when you are not. . ...etc. . . . . . ..grow up and do everyone...even your kid ...a favour.   Isn't that sweet? There are a LOT of things I could say in response to that, however since the person didn't leave her/his name I can't see any point in it. But if you know me, you know how inaccurate the whole letter is.  Anyway, it would be laughable if it weren't so sad that someone actually resorted to such immature "tactics".   Have a fabulous day!

      Today I registered Katya for Junior Kindergarten. She is SO excited about it! She wanted to join in the class right away today, but I had to explain to her - again - that she won't be going there until after summertime is over. It's going to be a long wait!

      We've been having warmer weather, together with freezing rain/rain and that sort of thing. As a result, the head has fallen off our snowman. Fortunately, Katya didn't find that very tragic.  Katya fell asleep on the couch while I was making supper. That was about 5 p.m. It is now almost 8. I changed her into her nightie and put her in her bed about half an hour ago. She didn't wake up. I sincerely hope she doesn't wake up till at least 6 a.m. With my luck, that will not be the case. Needless to say, I am going to have to go to bed early tonight.  Yesterday we went to Future Shop and got a wireless router for Rita to access the internet. Hooray - no holes drilled in the kitchen ceiling. I also got new speakers for my computer - including a sub. I'm quite happy about that. For the amount of time I spend here, it's nice to have decent sound. It also allows us to have "dinner music", either playing a CD on the computer or else via MusicMatch Jukebox.

      I finally have my computer running again. I think I (and Phil and Jason) spent about 1/3 of my day getting my computer to work more or less properly. And now it does. So I can sleep easy.  The beauty of it all is, for all the work that was put into this keyboard today, I now have cable internet. It doesn't make that big of a difference, until I actually download something. Or transfer a file. Most impressive.   Today Katya wanted to go to the pet store, more than anything. She said she wanted to see the "kitties, dogs, parrots and chipmunks". I think she meant hamsters. She was very sulky until we actually went, and then she was totally thrilled. She didn't want to buy anything, she just wanted to look at them all. She's a really fun little kid.

      It actually is nice. It's warm, anyway. And I don't really mind the rain at all. It's spring, it's Southern Ontario - what do you expect? It's very nice.  Tonight was Katya's last night of Cubbies, till the fall. Poor little thing - she was so sad, she cried. She loves Cubbies, even more than preschool, I think.  My angelfish has eaten four neon tetras in the past 5 days. I don't know how much of an angel I'd call it - nasty thing.

      I had a great day today.  Mark and I took Rita and William (Chinese students) to Chinatown in Toronto today. We walked around a lot, looked at some things, had a very delicious lunch (genuine Chinese food - not North American style) and bought some groceries and miscellaneous items, which we would not be able to find in Simcoe. It gave us an opportunity to learn a bit more about them, and to connect a bit. It was a very good thing.  After we came home, Mom & Dad brought Katya home. She was so happy to see me, which was great, too. She loves to go to Gramma and Grampa's, and the fact that - even though she was only there for the day - she was so happy to be home with Mommy, makes me feel very happy.  While Mom & Dad were here William made us some real Chinese green tea. It's quite different from what we're used to here, as well. The leaves are whole, and the flavour is a bit more pungent - but still very good. I felt healthier even while drinking it. :-P We had some other yummy Chinese treats, too.   Later, Rita said that she and William were happy that we enjoyed the Chinese food. It probably makes them feel more accepted, that we are so willing to try their food and try to eat with chopsticks. I am very proud of myself - I made it through the entire meal without a fork! I bought some chopsticks to use at home, with the appropriate meals. And Rita found some cute little pink chopsticks for Katya! Katya tried to use them this evening, but quickly got frustrated. She made a really good attempt for a 3-year-old... but I think she realized that it is much more difficult than it looks - especially when Rita uses them! Katya said to me, "I'm not a big girl to use chopsticks." I reassured her that it took Mommy a long time to learn how to use them right, and that if she practised, she would learn how to use them, too.  It was a very good day. I'm glad that we have Rita living here. I'm going to miss her when she leaves.

      I enjoy port. This is a new thing for me. I've often thought about trying it, and now that I have, I like it. Not all the time, but it's a nice thing for once in a while. It's good with swiss cheese and olives. Or it may just be that - as far as I'm concerned, anyway - anything is good with swiss cheese and olives.  I shovelled snow this morning, while it was still powdery, before it got heavy from melting. In some places there are easily two feet of snow on the ground. It's insane.  Pretty, though.

      Indeed, it has snowed far too much.  This morning when I looked out the window, the ground was bare (except for some grass and pavement).   There is currently snow on the ground, somewhere in the amount of six inches or more.  Not a pleasant day.

      See, the weather got cold again and I stopped blogging.   Not really, but I've just kinda forgotten about it.  Today my friend Jen had her baby girl, Megan. She was born at 12:30 in the afternoon and weighs 8 lb. 2 oz. That's a very  happy and exciting thing! It's a second child for Jen and Adam, and a little sister for their almost-3-year-old son, Connor.  Our church has been working through the 40 Days of Purpose, based on the book "The Purpose Driven Life" by Rick Warren. I've been leading a weekly small group in my house; we met tonight. It was really good. I am seeing a lot of growth in all the people who have been attending - a lot of this was shown in the prayer time, which was a really wonderful time of worship. I've been getting a lot out of it, too. A lot of the stuff I'm "learning" I was already aware of, but never really "got". Now I'm reading it and it's starting to take on real meaning. The trick at this point is getting myself to apply it to my life. But then, there's something I just learned about today - I can't do it myself. I can only change myself if I completely surrender to God and let Him give me the power to change. Much easier said than done - but the rewards are unimaginably marvelous, to say the least.  I'm feeling quite content. Not complacent. Content.

      Wow, it's 15 degrees out! I've had the windows open and fresh air blowing into the house. It's amazing! Of course, they're still talking about 1 degree and snow next week - but who cares? I'm going to enjoy today for what it is!  June called me to come over to the shoe store today and I bought two pairs of sandals. That's right - sandals! A perfect day to buy them, too. It feels like a getting-ready-for-summer kind of day.  There is officially no snow on our property, except for some ice still in the fish pond. I figured that's a pretty good indicator that, unfortunately, my fishies probably froze to death. Unless they found a nice little hidden spot that didn't freeze. Not highly likely, though, I fear. I'll just have to wait and see. If they are, indeed, frozen fish sticks, I guess I'll have to shell out another $1 for five more.  Katya has gone to my mom & dad's till tomorrow morning. This has given me an opportunity to clean the house, slowly. And what I clean, stays clean. Until tomorrow afternoon, of course. Oh well. At least I'll have an evening in a tidy house.

      The weather is warming up and it's really feeling like spring is just around the bend! Our front yard is virtually snowless, and the back yard is well on its way there.  It remains to be seen whether my goldfish made it through the winter. There is still ice on the pond.

      Yeah so we went to the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club show last night at Kool Haus, and it was great! I think they were actually better than the last time we saw them. And they said that Toronto was the best crowd they'd had on this tour, so that is cool.  Today I gave my angelfish away, to be eaten by a couple of piranhas, apparently. Not a happy thought for me, but the stupid fish finally went too far... it killed one of my new platys. So after angel went bye-bye, I went to the pet store and got some more fishies. This time it's more of a variety... well, I got another platy, and five more neons, but I also got a crab, a snail, and a shark. The guy told me the shark wouldn't eat the other fish. I hope he's right.

      As we're coming up on Easter, I think it's a good plan to go see this movie again. I know I won't be able to make it this week, because we're actually going to go see Black Rebel Motorcycle Club on Wednesday... not quite the same thing.  Regardless of what you think of the movie, you have to hand it to Mel for doing what he felt was right. I've got huge amounts of respect for him.   urlLink Gibson breaks Hollywood's 10 Commands

      I talked to my mom on the phone today after church. She told me Aunt Annie died this morning.  She'd gone for surgery a week ago, I guess it was, for her back. It was a 4-hour surgery and she pulled through it fine... however a day or so later she needed a blood transfusion. She had some rough days after that, but I guess yesterday she had a really good day - she was walking with a walker and generally feeling pretty good, all things considered. But she never woke up this morning.  The funeral will be Wednesday or Thursday this week.

      Today was the day Katya had been looking forward to for weeks. Yes, today was the day she went to see Sesame Street Live with her Grandma and her Mommy.  After a rough night's sleep (she kept waking up Mommy every couple of hours), she woke up in a grumpy mood. Mommy didn't help much, because she was grumpy from not enough sleep, too. However, they both made it through the day until 2 o'clock, when Grandma finally arrived to take them to London.  First, the three girls went to Wal-Mart, where Grandma bought Katya two pairs of shorts with flip-flop sandals, two tank tops with butterflies on them, several pairs of panties, and a Snow White bathing suit. Then they all went to McDonald's for supper. After that, they went downtown and found a parking spot right by the John Labatt Centre, which was where the show would be.   Since the show wasn't to start for an hour, they went to nearby Covent Gardens. Mommy was very impressed and bought some coffee. Grandma bought some treats for Daddy and Grampa, and some really neat lollipops for Katya. Then they went to the Centre for the show.  Forty minutes seemed like a really long time to wait for the show to begin, but Mommy bought a program, and Grandma read it to Katya. Then the show started. Katya could hardly believe her eyes! There were Big Bird, Ernie, Bert, Cookie Monster, the Count, Zoe, and Elmo - and others, too - all in real life, right there in front of her! She was sitting in the 4th row from the stage, so she even got to touch Zoe's hand and she got a hug from another monster, when they were walking through the audience!  Katya had a really wonderful time. Mommy and Grandma had fun, too - but mostly just because they could see how great it was for Katya.  Katya fell asleep on the way home from London. Mommy thinks she knows what Katya's dreaming about tonight....

      Wow, yesterday was a busy day - sort of. It was fun, anyway.  I didn't get the rest that I had planned, but since when does my day go as planned, anyway?   As it turns out, June had either a 12 hour stomach flu, or else food poisoning, so Austin came over to our house for the day. Well Katya had so much fun with him here! The two of them played so well... mind you, today's big job is going to be putting all of her toys and clothes away, since they emptied out every drawer and box in her room and piled everything in the middle of the floor. You can't even see the carpet in there...  When we took Austin home after supper (June was feeling better), we brought some sparklers and a very small package of fireworks, so the kids had a great time with those.  So even though I didn't get the "rest" I had anticipated, I still had a good day.

      Thank God for instant cappuccino. It's 10 to 7 in the morning and Katya's been up for an hour. Finally at 6:30 I got up and got her to come downstairs so Mark can sleep - I'm really hoping that sometime this afternoon he'll supervise her while I have a nap.  There was a very loud thunderstorm around 5 this morning, and Katya came into our room then. Poor little thing was so scared. We've had a lot of thunderstorms this weekend. A pretty sucky weekend for campers. Seems to me it's been that way for the past few years - although I could be wrong. I haven't been camping for years, so I probably am not as aware of it as some other people would be.  Friday was our 10th anniversary. In the morning I took Katya to Mom & Dad's for overnight. When I got home, Mark had bought me an enormous beautiful bouquet... that was a big surprise, because he had no vehicle while I was gone! But Dan had taken him to the florist. That was neat. Then Mark took me out for supper, but he wouldn't tell me where, just that it was in Brantford. Turns out he took me to Red Lobster! I haven't been there in over 10 years, and I keep telling him how much I want to go there. So that was really cool, too. The food was fabulous. And for dessert they gave us a huge piece of strawberry cheesecake for free!  Halfway through dinner, while I was saying we would have to go straight home so Mark could get to work on time, he told me that he had another surprise for me - he didn't have to go to work! So we went to see Troy in Ancaster. It was a good movie. It wasn't amazing, but it was good... and Brad Pitt looks  so  good for a 40-year-old.  Saturday we went to June's for supper. We took all the makings for nachos. That was fun. Then yesterday we went to church, and Wendy's, and then hung out at the youth centre playing pool all afternoon. We went to Domino's in Brantford for supper, with Dan, Craig and Ginny. Then Ginny came over and we watched Stealing Harvard. It was an interesting movie... quite stupid but some parts were funny.  So now it's holiday Monday and there's nothing to do except rest. At least that's what I'm hoping.

      At least, every Sunday is like Sunday... but that's not even really very funny, is it? I must be too tired to be humourous, or something.  Overall, it was a good day. Mildly boring, but that's pretty standard for me. Picked up June & the kids for Sunday School and church. After the service, I took them home, then came home and had a few friends over for steak barbecue. They didn't hang around long, though. So we just chilled all afternoon. Around 4 my parents came and took Katya to visit my aunts in town, so that gave Mark and me a little time to ourselves. Then after Katya came home we just chilled some more.   Today was the first day of enforcing a bedtime for Katya. I put her to bed at 8:30. She cried and cried about it, but she was asleep before 9. So, although she and I won't be able to go to any of Mark's ball games, and we won't be able to hang out at McDonald's or DQ after the games, it's definitely a good thing to get the girl on a schedule of some sort. Besides, it'll save some money if we're not going out that one night a week. Although it will suck to miss all of Mark's games. Oh well, just another "mom sacrifice".

      At any rate, just another day. Although Katya and I did go to my mom & dad's today, so that was nice. I got a haircut. Yeah... that's about it.  The weather is truly summerlike. Very pleasant. I could stand this kind of weather for another three or four months. That won't happen, of course. This is Ontario.   Katya fell asleep very soon after we left Mom & Dad's. She's on the couch now, sound asleep. I'm not sure if I should put her in bed, or what. I fear that if I do, she'll wake up immediately.  Yesterday Katya asked where the shark was. She said that she wanted to see it. I had to explain to her that it had died, and that we wouldn't be able to see it again. She, naturally, asked why. It was our first real discussion touching on death. I'm sure there will be more of those over the next five to 10 years.

      Joy! I finally have a new computer. It's much faster and nicer than my old one (which will be inherited by Katya at some point). But naturally, with the new 'puter comes new frustrations. I can't get into my online banking. I can't run PowerPoint (yet) to do the songs for church. But at this time, I'm happy anyway!   Now I just have to drag myself away from this machine long enough to do some stuff around the house (clean, make food, play with Katya) and enjoy the summer weather we're having.

      I wonder how many other 30-somethings there are out there who can't get that Sinead O'Connor song out of their heads now that the movie Troy is coming.  What a day today has been - so much!  This morning, Mark and I took Katya to Zellers to get her a baseball glove. This evening was her first t-ball practice. She really seemed to enjoy it. I hope it goes over better than soccer did. So far, so good.  In the afternoon, Katya and I went to a pet store and while there I bought one of those really cool (at least I think so) treasure chests that go in the aquarium, and you hook it up to the air pump so that it bubbles every so often. I think it's really neat - Mark thinks it's way too cheesey. Oh well. Rita and Katya both like it, too, so Mark is clearly outnumbered on that one.  My new computer should be arriving this week - maybe even tomorrow - I can hardly wait!!!

      Yeah, no kidding, after all this time I've FINALLY got a copy of this CD. Took me long enough... Mark got it for me. Naturally I'm enjoying it. It was - what - just over 4 years ago that I saw Primus in Cincinatti, and only now have I got an album by them. I'm looking forward to seeing String Cheese Incident at Lollapalooza. Les Claypool is truly the most amazing bassist.

      It's nice and warm and sunny for a Monday. Katya woke up in a nasty mood this morning, but after she calmed down a bit and played with Daddy, she decided to count to 39. It was just strange. She's at preschool now. In less than a month she goes for her "preview" day for kindergarten. My little girl is growing up!  Quarter to 11 a.m. and almost 25 degrees... it's going to be a nice day. I hope.

       urlLink  Van Helsing movie review   We went to see this last night. It was pretty entertaining - not scary, kinda funny, kinda silly - I enjoyed it, although it certainly wasn't intellectually stimulating. Hugh Jackman looked pretty good, though. The thing that I think really engaged me is the fact that it's interesting enough - the whole vampire/monster/etc. bit (kinda touched on my "Science in Science Fiction" course in university - some of the books I read then) - but with all the evil that was in it, it didn't have that satanic feel that turns me off from so many of those sort of movies (Sleepy Hollow, for example). It certainly did leave things open for a sequel, which is one of those irritating things about so many movies that come out now. If we ever find it for cheap on used DVD, I'll probably buy it.

      Today we (Mark and Katya, June and Austin, and me) went to Ikea. It was a good thing. The kids love to play there, and I love to shop there. And now I have some furniture to assemble! Hooray! AND... after the furniture is assembled, I get to hook up some electronics! Woo hoo! What a great evening it will be.  Katya is sleeping on the couch right now. This is a slight problem... she'll be up ALL night at this rate. Oh well. Maybe I can get her to just watch shows on TV while I put together the furniture. Who knows, she might even be able to "help" me a bit.  The weather's been nice today. The lawn needs to be cut. I want to spray it, too, but the wind never dies down enough.

      For some reason, I'm feeling pretty down. I don't know if it's because of the weather (very rainy/stormy/changeable) or if it's because I haven't been eating as much (seeing as I'm trying to lose weight) or lack of sleep or what...  Maybe it's because my shark died today. I know, in my last post I said he was doing so well... and he was. Even this morning. But this afternoon he started swimming like crazy around the aquarium, just total madness... then he would lie there and do nothing... then finally he got jammed in the little rock/cave thing I've got in there, so I helped him out... but by that point he was almost dead. I put him in a little container with water, and he gasped a bit and looked around frantically... but that was it for him. I think maybe I'll bury him in the back yard. Flushing seems so unfair for such a pretty fish.  Today I registered Katya for t-ball. I think she'll like it more than soccer... at least I hope so. Because Mark plays ball, maybe she will make that connection and get into it enough that she'll actually wear the uniform.  Tomorrow we're going to Ikea. Maybe that will cheer me up.

      Which is what Katya just told me.  Katya is just now getting over a bout of tonsillitis. Poor kid, she gets so sick with that. She's still not 100% but she's getting her energy back.  The weather's been nice enough today that I actually got an iota of yard work done. Although really, if you look at everything I've done so far this year, I think it's more than I did all last summer... I can hardly wait till it warms up some more.  Mark and I are trying to lose weight. It's about time, really, for both of us. We're both trying to watch what we eat; Mark is doing exercise and I'm doing Pilates type exercises; and I'm also taking various types of herbal supplements. It's kind of too soon to be able to tell if it's really making a difference, but I sure hope it is. Otherwise it's such a waste!  My fishies are all doing quite well. My oldest neon died last week; the monster pleco cleaned up his remains. It was weird. My sharkie almost got ich, but I gave him some medicine in time to get rid of it. Hooray! My snail has grown. I don't see the fiddler crab very often, but I know he's in there, because every so often I see him waving his big claw. I really enjoy having fish. They're not very affectionate, as pets go, but they sure are quiet.

      Well, our boarder, Rita, just moved out today. I helped her move her things. She and her boyfriend (who lived next door) are going to be living in a very nice house owned and inhabited by one man (whose wife left him six months ago). He seems very happy to have them there.  I wish Rita well in all her future endeavours. I will miss her.  Now it's just our family here, again.

      So, I'll begin more or less where I left off.  Sunday Our church picnic. It was good. A very pleasant day, weather-wise. They set up a water slide down a hill... Katya went down it 15 times - no exaggeration. She had a blast!  Monday June and her kids came over. Katya bit Austin. June and I ate cake. I voted. I was greatly disappointed in the national results, although I'm very pleased with the way our local riding turned out. Katya played t-ball.  Tuesday (today) Mom and Katya and I went to Brantford. Mom bought lots of things for Katya, 90% of which was Disney Princess-themed. Katya is staying overnight at Mom & Dad's. Mark and I went out for dinner. Mark played ball. I cleaned Katya's room, removing a good 80% of the toys from her room, since she rarely plays with them anyway. I'm not sure why I used % twice in this section.  I'm very tired. I'm going to bed now. I plan to sleep in. I'm sure that it won't work out - it never does.

      My 3 1/2 year old daughter is playing with her Leap Pad. Her favourite book is "Princess Stories". She is listening to the song "Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo" and trying to whistle along.  Katya could whistle long before she could talk. When she was a wee baby, before she was one year old, and before she had teeth, she would whistle all the time. But as her teeth grew in, and she began talking more or less fluently, she lost her ability to whistle.  She desperately wants to learn how to play piano. For our 10th anniversary, my husband and I bought an electronic piano, so that we would have a piano available for Katya whenever she would want to play. She doesn't just bang on the keyboard - she touches the keys gently and rhythmically, as if she were playing a masterpiece. To her it is. To me it is, too. Some of her music sounds better than some of the things we hear on the CBC.  Katya loves to sing and dance. She sings "I Know You" (more commonly known as Once Upon A Dream) and dances around the living room. She sings lullabies for her Daddy when he goes to bed after work.   The best music that she makes, however, is when her Daddy makes her laugh.

      I feel like doing nothing today. Even Katya is being low-key.  We went to the beach yesterday - June, Austin, Katya, Mark and me. It was very windy, but comfortable. I wore only SPF 15 sunblock (actually not a block - just a screen) and ended up getting a bit pink in some spots. At least I don't look like a snowperson now.  Today was garbage day. It's very odd, because it's not windy at all. Usually it's very windy on garbage day. That way we end up with all sorts of interesting things in our back yard (how it gets through the gate I'm not sure, but trash is very resourceful...).

      Katya has two imaginary pet kitties. One is named Hessa and one is named Nessa. Yesterday they were Hissa and Nassa, but they've evolved to their new names. She has kitty toys for them and everything. They come with us in the van and they play with her in the house or outdoors. Hessa is pink and orange, I think, and Nessa is black and white and gray...  Our friend Jason is over visiting us for a few days. Well, he's visiting a lot of people, but he's staying with us.   Here is the sad news, though. We had tickets to  urlLink  Lollapalooza,  which, tragically, has been cancelled. I was so looking forward to seeing Morrissey again, as well as BRMC... and then The Flaming Lips, whom I've never seen... but that's life, I guess. So we've decided to go to  urlLink the Curiosa festival  instead. The Cure, Interpol, The Rapture, and Mogwai - among others - that almost makes up for it. I just hope they don't go cancelling that one.

      The kitchen table is a safe place under which my daughter can hide when there is something frightening on TV. It's a place for things to accumulate - the day's mail, newspapers, stuff that needs to be done... It's a meeting place, an eating place, a reading place. It needs to be cleared and/or cleaned several times a day. It has served as a desk. It has served as an easel. It has served many, many meals. It came in a box. I assembled it myself. I am proud of that. I did not get my kitchen table from IKEA. I find that mildly disappointing.  It's a good, sturdy table. I don't mind if there are marker stains on it. The various scrapes and scars on it don't bother me. It's a young table - it needs to build a history. I used to cover it with a tablecloth. I don't do that anymore. Now I have four placemats on it. They do virtually nothing to protect the table. They simply mark the spot where the dishes should go at mealtime. It is made of wood. It used to be a tree. It has not forgotten that.

      Today we went to June's for a birthday party for her kids. Katya was tired, I think - at any rate she was really touchy. But by the end of the night, after June's kids had gone to bed, Katya was being very sweet and nice.  She fell asleep on the way home.   As I was driving home, I was thinking about when I was a kid.  I remember going to people's places with my parents. Some of them, I know who they were. Others, I have no idea. But I remember how exciting it was to stay up late and be with the grown-ups. I remember curling up on other people's couches. I remember going outside and it was so dark, and the stars were in the sky. I remember how neat the streetlights and vehicles looked in the night, and falling asleep in the car.   It's neat to think I'm building these sorts of memories for my lovely daughter.

      My cousin Johnny died when I was barely three years old. I don't remember him at all. I hate that. He was my godfather. I know he loved me a lot, because my mom has told me that.  Aunt Annie died a few weeks ago. She was Johnny's mom. She was also Nicky's mom - he died as a baby, back in the '50s. Johnny died in 1971, in a car accident. My Uncle Nick - Aunt Annie's husband - died several years ago of a heart attack, the day before they were to move from their farm to their brand new house in town. All that is left of the family is my cousin Mary Ann. She is a strong person.  I look at photos of Johnny and I try to remember him. I don't remember much of anything before the age of 4, and even those memories are cloudy and dim. All my life, it seems, I've tried to remember something about him. Nothing ever comes.  In all the photos I have of Johnny, he looks really cool. I think I probably really liked him. I must have, since I feel such a need to remember him. I'm pretty sure that if he were still alive, I'd like him a lot.   Johnny will always be 17. He was racing in a car with some friends. I don't know who those friends were. I don't know how his death affected them. I don't know if they still, from time to time, remember Johnny, but I sure hope they do. I'm sure someone does, and not only when another funeral brings us to the place where his body was buried.  To me, Johnny isn't even a memory. He's just someone in a photograph; someone whose death caused enough pain that the family rarely mentions him. Someone very special to me - even though I know nothing more than his name and his face.   urlLink    Me, Cousin Johnny, and my brother Steve&nbsp; urlLink

       Tonight's blog is being done using my new speech recognition software, sans editing.   Good evening and how's it going .  I'm playing with my new toy tonight, and it is going to be interesting to see exactly what shows up on your.  So far it's going pretty good, but I have to say, when juice over this afternoon, and we were playing with it, a lot of this stuff just didn't make sense.  I don't know if it's because I don't speak clearly, or if it's because I'm Canadian and this is designed for an American accent, or if it's just that I have an practice did in the fourth to recognize my voice properly, but some of the things that comes up with are purely and she really miss furious.    I have to play a team Bolton many.  My mom and dad came to watch her play.  She was really excited about people like she usually is.  And she had a lot of fun of course.  After the game we plan to protect the church, was practicing with the worship team, and then after that To do a clean.    Catic did not get to bed until after market gone to war to many , she watched blue's clues for a while.  I know I let her stay up for two days, but we have not a ritual I guess you could call it, that we go through at that time, so it takes time to put it to bed.    Anyway, tomorrow we're going to choose house, for a barbecue.  It's also the kids for a party which they have together every year .    I hope that you have fun trying to decide I've said.  It makes just enough sense to not make sense.  Perhaps eventually it will make sense.

      Much better than bleach.  All I can smell is garlic.  I have a roast and potatoes in the oven, and I think I've put way too much garlic on them.    On a completely unrelated note, today I set up the speech recognition utility on my computer.   Now I can dictate my blog to the computer, and edit it afterward.  Maybe a bit tedious, but it's kind of fun.  Actually it's really fun, because it's neat to see what my speech is recognized as.  I will continue to experiment with it, and probably get tired of it in time, but for now, it's a lot of fun.

      I was doing something near the kitchen sink today when it dawned on me that the unpleasant odour I detected was coming from the drain. So I decided to pour some bleach down the drains, and also wash out the sinks with bleach.  Great.  I highly suspect my entire house reeks of "fresh new scent" bleach right now.  I wouldn't know -  The same "fresh new scent" has permeated my nasal passages and now everything smells like bleach to me.   And I have a headache.

       urlLink Morrissey's 'Bush' comment   Like Morrissey hasn't made a political comment before? The only difference is that now there is the internet, so it's easier for people to make their reactions public. Also, he's international now.  And what's with the songs they chose to mention in the article? Where's "How Soon Is Now" or "Panic"? Obviously they just picked songs they think make him look bad.   I hate the press.

      It is very quiet right now. Katya is not home. I could be playing music loudly, or something, but I'm not. I'm not sure why. Oh well.  Yesterday Katya and I went next door, to swim in the pool. With water wings, and holding on to a noodle, Katya swam all by herself - from one end of the pool to the other, and all the way around the pool, over and over - the whole time grinning and yelling "I'm doing it!" She was SO excited. So was I...  The day before that we went to the beach with June and Austin (and Mark). Katya and Austin ran the length of the beach chasing seagulls (or eagles, as Katya calls them). It was a fun day.  Also yesterday, Mom and Dad came and picked up Katya. She stayed overnight last night and she'll be coming home tomorrow. I miss her. I'm supposed to be cleaning the house. I've done some work in the kitchen, and I'll do some more yet tonight. That way tomorrow I can try to get her bedroom tidied.  This morning, Mark and I went to the casino in Brantford. It was fun. We didn't come out ahead, but we didn't lose much, so it was good. I spent some time with June today, too.  For supper tonight I made homemade chicken soup and homemade bread (in the bread machine). I'm a little bit proud of myself for that.

      Hello again.  Today Mark led worship at church again, it's been a while. I played bass and sang. I have nasty blisters on two of my fingers. It makes it hard to type. I think it went well, though. Carl played guitar with us. I really like when we do worship with him - we get some really nice harmony going with the vocals.  After church we went to Camp 31 with some friends, for lunch. The food there is SO good - pulled pork - yum! And the servings are big... we brought lots of food home with us. I think we'll be going there a lot this summer, like every time we're in Port Dover. Katya slept almost the whole time we were there. I ate so much that I wanted a nap when I got home, but of course she was wide awake. I tried to nap while she watched some shows, but it just didn't work. Oh well, maybe I'll try to go to bed early tonight.  My house is a disaster. It desperately needs cleaning up. I will try to do some of that tomorrow, while Katya's at preschool. Maybe even a bit tonight. I have to remember to take the van to the garage tomorrow morning. Maybe I'll bring Katya's stroller along and leave it at the preschool, so I'll have it for picking her up afterward.  Wow, this is a really rambly post. I'm even boring myself.

      Today was the Grand Opening of Food Basics here in town, so Katya and I went there in the morning. I think half of Simcoe was there! There were some good prices there, and they have a really good international food section. I think I'll shop there sometimes, but I doubt it will completely replace Zehrs.  Katya had a great time at her kindergarten preview. She already loves both the kindergarten teachers, just from an hour there. They did a craft and sang songs and read a story and played with toys and saw some cocoons. While they did that, the teacher (one of my best friends in Gr. 13) told the parents all about the program at the school. It's very individualized, which is cool. I'm feeling a lot better about sending Katya there. Especially seeing how well she adjusted to it - so much better than about half the other kids. Preschool is a definite advantage there.  After that we (all three of us) went to the funeral home to see my aunt. I explained everything to Katya as well as I could think to, before we left and once we got there, before we saw her body. Katya was quite uncomfortable with the whole thing. She got my mom to carry her to see Aunt Annie, and the look on Katya's face was very unhappy, although she didn't cry. But I think she more or less understands death now. She wanted to leave right away. We spent the rest of the afternoon at my aunt's house. Mom and I made supper for my cousin and her family, and some of her friends who had come.  Tonight when I put Katya to bed, I asked her about seeing Aunt Annie and if she had any questions. She said "no". But then she was quiet a bit, and then said "Yes". She asked if "the bad man cut Aunt Annie's body off" (like from her Disney movies), and so I tried to explain it to her again, that Aunt Annie was old and she had been sick and had an operation, and her heart just couldn't work anymore, and that now her "thinking and feeling part" is with Jesus, and only her body is left here. I think she's more or less OK with it now. I won't mention it again unless she brings it up. I just hope she doesn't have any nightmares.

      I have a new favourite book. I knew it would be my favourite from the moment I first heard about it. But it wasn't until today that I actually got my hands on a copy of it. And I'm so excited.      urlLink This book  could have been written by me. The author is completely in my head about the topic. And I find it truly reassuring that I am not a freak - or if I am, at least I'm not alone.     I have found errors on a bronze plaque attached to an historic building. I have found innumerable errors on signs everywhere. I have found errors in at least two different editions of the Bible. I first began noticing errors in Grade 5, when I corrected my teacher's spelling weekly, if not daily. This eventually, over the years, led to my most suitable employment as a proofreader at  urlLink our local daily newspaper  - which, sadly, but not surprisingly, has gone downhill grammatically since I left (since they didn't see fit to replace me).     Are there any other sticklers out there?

      Hi.  I know it's been a while. I haven't forgotten about you. I've just been... distracted.  Yes, it's a feeble excuse. Would it be better if I just said that I've had nothing to say?  OK, all right, I understand. I should have blogged. I know you've been waiting to hear from me. I'm sorry.  I'll try to do better from now on.  Will you forgive me?

      This morning I got a phone call from Rogers offering me an amazing deal on a family plan for cell phones (PCS, what have you. I still call them cell phones). I said that I think our current contract with Bell doesn't expire till sometime next year, could you call me back. So she said they'll call in February.  Later on today we discovered that we had misplaced our cell phone. We looked all over and couldn't find it.  When we got home, I called Bell Mobility to find out when our contract expires.   Turns out it expires 13 days from now.  Then we found our phone.  Now I am researching "wireless plans" - the family type, where my husband and I will each have our own phone. As far as I can tell at this point, I want to go with Telus over Rogers (those are my only options, geographically, as we don't want to stay with Bell). I'm really not sure what phone to go with.  That is where I need the assistance of you, my faithful readers. If you are Canadian and have a cellular plan, please tell me with whom and how you like it. Also if you have friends with better (or worse) plans than you, I'd like to know. I'd like to know about service, coverage, pricing and customer service.  Also - and anyone with a cell phone can help me here - what brand/model of phone would you recommend?  I really appreciate your help.   Thanks.

      My daughter has just informed me that she is happy.  Here is what she is doing:  She is painting. She has three little pots of paint, each one a mixture of red, yellow and green. The paper I have given her is covered with various splotches of paint. The newspaper intended to protect the table is covered with various splotches of paint. My daughter is covered with various splotches of paint.  She is wearing a tank top. Nothing else. Apparently she likes to paint in the semi-nude. She is an artist.  My daughter is happy.

      Katya is dancing to "What's This?" on Nightmare Before Christmas.    There is a goldfinch perched on a tall weed-flower in my back yard. He is pulling the seed pod apart, eating each seed in it. It's one of the most wonderful things I've ever seen. He's getting seeds the way he should, not from a feeder, but from the plant itself. I knew letting my back yard grow wild was a good thing. It is so much more satisfying than watching him eat from a feeder.

      It was a good weekend.     On Saturday, Cora and Rob, my friends from Toronto, came over and stayed overnight. It's so good to see them again. Cora's been my friend since 1987 - first year university. I am so glad that our friendship has been preserved, even though I've changed so much since then.    Cora and Rob left this morning when we left for church. After church, we spent the afternoon at  urlLink June  and Shannon's. June and I spent about an hour in bed, reading Reader's Digest and chatting. Mark and Shannon watched the kids. It was wonderful. Later on, June made up Mark like a drag queen. I took photos. They should be interesting.    Mark goes back to work tonight. We've had a good two weeks while he's been off. It sucks that he has to go back, but at the same time, it's good to be getting back to routine.    I'm sure that 17 years ago, when Cora and I first met, I never thought I'd be happy about anything to do with "routine".

      Friday morning. 8 a.m. What the heck?    Yeah, I'm online. Not in bed. I've had time to add another toy to my blog site, as well as a few comments to other blogs. I've begun to compile songs for a CD I want to put together, featuring prominent songs in my life (I will probably blog the playlist once I've got it figured out). I've watched Elliot Moose and Peep with Katya... oh yeah, that's why I'm up. That dear child is convinced that the moment the sun begins to peek over the horizon, it's time to get up and get dressed. I've at least managed to keep her in her nightie. Well, until just a moment ago when she put on her so-called "Sleeping Beauty dress" - a large red satin dress that was once used at someone's wedding by a junior bridesmaid.    Later this morning we'll be going to visit my mom and dad. That's a good thing. Mom will often let me have a nap while she looks after Katya. I'm looking forward to that possibility.    Katya is now singing a song that she's making up about Friday. I think I'll go listen.

      I have been doing some online research.  "Light beer" has a different meaning in Canada than it does in the U.S. Go figure.  In the U.S., light beer is beer that has less than 100 calories per bottle. In Canada, "light" has nothing to do with calories. All it means is that it has 4% alcohol or less.  I wish I'd known that before I went out and bought a 2-4 of light beer.  Moral: Do your research BEFORE you buy something, not after.

      My husband and daughter and I spent a lovely weekend away, at my mother-in-law's "friend's" cottage, north of Owen Sound.  No computer, no cable, no DVD player. There was, however, a microwave and dishwasher. Some cottage!  On Sunday we went to Red Bay. What a great beach for Katya! We were at least a quarter of a mile out... I don't know distances well enough to say for sure, but we were WAY out there... and it was barely up to our waists. Katya could play in the water and we didn't have to watch her too closely, because it wasn't anywhere near over her head. She had lots of fun. Because the water is so shallow, it was very warm. I mean, bathtub warm - no exaggeration! And there were all these little minnows swimming around. If I stayed still in one place for long enough, I'd be surrounded by them, and they'd nip on my feet. It really tickled!  On Monday, before we went home, we went to Sauble Beach. Now there's a beach! The words "vast expanse" come to mind. I actually laid in the sun for a while, and believe it or not, with my SPF 40, I actually got the beginnings of a tan! Katya, on the other hand, got a bit burnt. Not painfully so, but a bit pinker than I'd have liked. After spending two hours on the beach (and in the water), we went to the shops. I bought - wonder of wonders - a bikini! I haven't had one of those since... well... ever. But it actually doesn't look that bad on. And if I continue with my thrice weekly workouts, by the end of the summer it should look pretty good.  So now we're getting back into routine. I have several piles of laundry to do, which I'm leaving till sometime later. This afternoon I have to do something not routine, which is go to my late aunt's house and pick out stuff that I want (furniture, quilts, pictures, etc.).  I just realized I have to clean my house. This week is "company week" - we're having house guests tomorrow and on the weekend. Ah well...

        I have been meaning to post this for a while. It was written in 1990 - well before blogs, the internet, or even a PC in every home.    The first thing I remember: Moving from a house I no longer know to the house in which I grew up. Grey insulbrick and bright sun. Green grass and - "Who is that little girl on the step of  my  new house?" I thought. We were three. You lived just around the bend, on the other side of Big Creek. I had just moved onto your grandparents' old farm. This is how we grew up together.  With our respective brothers, we played in the hay mow in my dad's big barn. We climbed up on to the high beams and jumped way down into the deep loose straw. We built elaborate forts with the bales. We looked for kittens in your dad's barn. When I was big enough, I could ride my bicycle to your house. We rode our bicycles together around the concession. We rode our bicycles on your paved driveway. I stayed overnight. In your room, you had a dimmer switch. Ken and Barbie did nasty things. We found a big June bug under your bed. You stayed overnight. We popped popcorn. We talked. We laughed. We played with your Lite Brite. We played on your piano. We swam in your swimming pool. We played in your parents' trailer. We slept there overnight. We talked about what we'd do. Now. Later. Tomorrow. The future.  We spent less time together as we grew older. Seven months younger than I, you were in the grade behind me. We met new people, made new friends.  We still sat together on the school bus. We still visited. Now we listened to each other's records and tapes. We talked about the boys at school. The day before you started high school, we went for lunch at the Coop. It was a sunny day, but we sat inside. We ate hamburgers and french fries. We laughed a lot. We talked about what we'd be doing in ten years. That was eight years ago.  This summer I saw you at the Country Kitchen, where you were working. We decided to spend a day together. When my parents went to the States for a few days, you came over. I cooked a lasagna. We went to a slo-pitch game. We talked about people we knew. We talked about plans for your wedding next September. You were going to secretarial school. I wanted to be a writer. We talked about the future. It felt like no time had passed since we had last spoken. That was five months ago.  Saturday, I thought I should call you. Sunday, I didn't. Monday morning I woke to my mother's report. She called. She verified. I felt as if part of me had been wrenched away. My parents and I went to see your parents. They cried. I cried. I cried. That was one week ago.   It was summer. I was wearing shorts and a short sleeved shirt, light coloured, with flowers. I was walking down Main Street going into Port Rowan. You and your mom and dad were on the front lawn of a house. The house was small, with white wooden siding and deep green scalloped trim. The grass was lush, a living green. You were dressed similarly to me - shorts, short sleeved shirt, light coloured, with small flowers. Your hair was wavy, light golden brown. The breeze was soft and warm. I stopped on the sidewalk in front of the house. Your dad, wearing a light blue short sleeved shirt and old jeans, smiled and said you were ready. You got up from where you were sitting on the grass, and began to walk along the sidewalk into town with me. Your mom spoke, and we stopped and turned. She said, "Arlene told me to tell you to wait until she'd finished her tea." We paused, then you said, "That's okay, she's already said 'bye." We turned back toward town and walked along the sidewalk. On the next block over, on the left, there was a parade we could see between the houses. A band was marching, wearing red jackets. The breeze was gentle, but warm and enveloping. You were on my right. I turned to you as we walked, and said, "You don't look dead." You looked back at me with a loving smile and said, "No, but you do. Where I am, everyone is so  alive ."   Wednesday was your funeral. I cried.  (February 19, 1990)

      My sweet darling daughter, who usually loves everything and is gleefully happy, has decided that today she hates everything except Sleeping Beauty.  For example, one of her favourite television shows has just come on. Katya yells, "I hate Angelina. I love Sleeping Beauty." A moment later, she says, "Hey, we have this one."  She is now watching Angelina quite happily. But I know if I asked her, she would tell me she hates it.

      It is currently 6:49 a.m. on Sunday morning. What am I doing up at this hour, you may ask. Suffice it to say, I have a 3 1/2 year old daughter whose wake time has to do entirely with the sun and not at all with the clock. Even with a dark shade over the window, a room facing East gets light at the moment the sun peeks over the horizon - whether the sky is clear or overcast.  If it were just me, I would stay in bed and put a show on the TV for Katya. However, Mark is home (it being Sunday morning, besides, he's on holiday for two weeks), so I - out of consideration for him - followed my bright and happy child downstairs.  It is currently 6:53 a.m. I have been awake for an hour.  Thank God for coffee.

      ... have been something else.  Yesterday I formatted my hard drive. Stuff was not working properly, so I just cleared it off and started from scratch. I got to bed at about 4 a.m. Stuff is working much better now.  Today was the first day of my new job. It was mostly getting familiar with the store and starting to learn about the wines. I enjoyed it; I think I'm going to like working there. The people are all very nice.  Mom picked up Katya from school, so that left me free for the evening. We had a worship practice, and since June was over (sans kids), after Mark left for work we decided to do something we otherwise wouldn't be able to do. So we went to the casino in Brantford. It was fun, but I wasted bunch of money. Oh well. After that we went to Domino's. We had a good time, but we were both pretty tired.  Well, I still am tired. I need to get to bed - I work at 9:30 and here it is already 2....

      Yesterday we went to the  urlLink Curiosa  festival in Toronto. Besides the ridiculous cost of concert shirts (bought one for $40) and food (beer and jumbo pretzel for $9.25), it was a great concert-going experience. Naturally, I prefer club gigs, but this sort of show had to be at a larger venue ( urlLink Molson Amphitheatre ) because of its two-stage nature.  I found it highly enjoyable. As I mentioned, there were two stages. I only saw one band at the second stage ( urlLink Cooper Temple Clause ), but I thought they were fairly good. The setup there was much more to my liking - more like one of the larger clubs. It would have been a much better location for  urlLink Mogwai , which was actually the first band I saw. As with the first time I saw them, they were fabulous. And loud. However, the huge and wide-open space at the Amphitheatre really didn't do them justice. I much preferred their show at the  urlLink Horseshoe .  After Mogwai was when I went to see Cooper Temple Clause. I got back to the main stage just in time for  urlLink The Rapture  - again, a fabulous performance, although I preferred their show at  urlLink Kool Haus . They were a lot of fun, at any rate.  During the break after The Rapture is when I wandered about in search of sustenance. I had the option of purchasing water for $3.50 or beer for like $5... obviously, the choice was beer. The pretzel I bought was rather good, and from what my husband said it was much better than his rather disappointing  steamed  sausage. Steamed? Come on, people - really!   urlLink Interpol  was next. It was the first time I had seen them. I was not disappointed. They are definitely better live than on disc - and they're great on disc. I'd love to see them in a club gig. The singer sounded even more  urlLink Ian Curtis -y than recorded. I was impressed.  I missed the Muse show on the second stage, but it's not killing me. I was sticking around for the main event -  urlLink The Cure . They were fabulous. For a fat, old guy, Robert's simply amazing! His voice still does everything it's supposed to. And I enjoyed this show much more than the first time I saw them, which was in (I think) 1993 (wow - is it really 11 years?).  You know, even with all the younger, bizarrely attired people there, I didn't feel out of place. I've been a Cure fan since I first heard them in 1986. And I know, even that makes me a latecomer. There were some fabulous people there with grey hair and fanny packs - but you know that they are the original Cure fans. It was very cool to see them there.  I rarely have anything good to say about "arena" shows.  urlLink The Verve  was an exception. So was Curiosa. I was - and remain - truly impressed.

      I don't even feel like blogging tonight. But I am.  Katya is asleep on the big blue chair, watching Sleeping Beauty. Go figure. The first thing she says to anyone she sees - not meets, but  sees  - is something involving Sleeping Beauty. Today at church, the King's Kids leader asked the kids to tell her something that makes God special. Katya said that He made Sleeping Beauty.  I've been attempting to tweak my computer lately. Adding plugins, actually. To MSN Messenger (Plus!) and to Firefox. The result? Things were going well, for a bit. I was getting all sorts of cool stuff. But, (again) go figure, I overdid it. Now I can't login to MSN Messenger at all - so it's plain, boring little Windows Messenger for me till I can figure out how to fix it. I can still use Plus! on WM but it's not near as much fun. Also, my Gmail notifier doesn't work properly anymore. That I really can't figure out.  Oh well. You'd think after this many years I'd have learned to leave well enough alone.  I  am  blonde, though.

      This morning it was the red platy. Drifting, lifelessly, behind the rock cave. They have been working on its tail for some time now. The tail was gone. The fins were gone.  It still had its nose.  I wonder if the pet store needs any more puffer fish.

      I was sitting at the table, eating lunch, when I noticed my largest danio floating at the top of the tank. I looked more closely, and it became very clear that not only had his nose and tail been nipped off, but his belly was split open and mostly emptied.  I removed the fishy corpse and flushed it.  Then Mark asked how many neons I was supposed to have. I examined the tank again, and it appears that I am missing three of them.  My puffer fish have very fat bellies.

      It's a nice rain today. Not too hard, but not too light, either. Katya came to me and asked if she could go out and play in the rain. I figured, why not? She's a kid - it's fun. So I told her, sure. She went upstairs and changed her clothes into pants and a sweater; put on a jacket (including hood) and boots, and got her umbrella. Then she went out and jumped in some puddles and had a great time. I took the obligatory photos. After a bit she came back to me and said she didn't want to play in the rain anymore, so we came back into the house.  These are the kind of days that make up for all the crappy ones.

I had a bit of free time today, and I looked half decent, so I decided to drop off my resume to her.  As I walked into the store, she greeted me happily. I handed her my resume in an envelope, and she said, "You have amazing timing!" Turns out today was her first day back at work after her vacation, and they'd had some major scheduling issues while she was gone. Just this morning she was thinking about me, wondering if I still wanted a job there. Without even looking at my resume, she took me aside and asked how soon I'd be able to start working; and can we meet tomorrow to talk it over. She would like me to start as soon as possible.  I can still hardly believe it. I was praying about this job, and basically said to God, "OK, I'm going to apply for this job [at that point I wasn't even certain there was a job; it was only something that had been hinted at], and if it is Your will for me to be employed at this place and at this time, then I believe You will make it work." So it looks to me like God has put this one together for me. I'm feeling pretty good about it - although still somewhat overwhelmed.
