       w00t w00t. so uhm Ill just make this blog in english cause i think most people will read it in english. or... uhm... yeah.     &nbsp;   Concert crap:     &nbsp;     Chivo - Chivo - Chivo - Chivo -  Fecha: Domingo 18 de Julio. Hora: 5:00 p.m.Lugar: Gospel Music, Outlet Mall, San Pedro.Valor: ¢1.000.Grupos: Osho, No Resolution?, Up Shock, Neginot, Días de Agonía.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;   Ok, so this was my first time at going to Gospel. I shouldve known this before, but people there told me the concerts at Gospel generally start at about 6:30. i got there at 4:50. The concert started at 7 pm. *gonk* well, that was a lowdown on the café, since most people got there early. Not at 7.     &nbsp;   I only got to see Neginot, Up Shock, Dias de Agonia and No resolution?.     &nbsp;   The concert started out with neginot playing. I basically went to the gig to check out neginot, since i know the bassist dude and wanted to listen to them. So basically you could say the play death metal? You know, a hardcore type of scream, and some changing riffs... everyone in the band can play really good. The singer was constantly jumping up and down the bandstand, blah. Sorta got everyone in the mood, and the sound guy was using them to try out noise. everyone was just getting seated when they played.     &nbsp;   next was... no resolution. I cant really remember these guys, i liked them but not that much. their music could get better anytime. sorta crappy riffs and crap that made me hungry. yeah, hungry. anyways, ill give this band 6/10, just because i cant really remember them.     &nbsp;   Then came dias de agonía. i had never heard this band. First of all, every guy in the band was straight edge, from what i could see. These guys play hardcore. Just hardcore. Didnt really get the lyrics because of all the screaming. The singer dude looks gay. i mean, maybe he was trying to look tough, but he really looks gay. like hes coming at you to rape you. the drummer got his drum loose and they had to stop playing. everyone clapped except me, who... was maybe too tired. the singer really needs to know how to sing. i mean, yeah, screaming sounds cool but if all you hear is GIAR GIARR YEARHG! for like 20 minutes it gets boring. overall good band. but not worth buying their cd.     &nbsp;   then came upshock. ok these guys i had already heard, but i dont like them that much anymore. its general punk that you would get by listening to pennywise. the singer was constantly wooing out the lyrics and then screaming a bit. Really retarded. and he's like 40, i mean, what the fuck. ok this band sucks ass, dont even pay for one of their concerts. get a guitar and make quick noises and there you have upshock.     &nbsp;   so basically lets talk about the place. Its your general internet cafe, a 20 by 20 room with red dim lights. The sound guy sucks. He plays the music so loud i got bored and left. it starts hurting after a while. specially when they play hardcore. The room is so packet up with chairs theres no room for skanking/moshing. besides, all the people gather around the center like if they cant get to see the band from 10 meters away.     &nbsp;   There was this slipknot fan dude who kept making coreography to the music, looked kinda like a dj with no turntable. the only difference between the dj and this dude would be that uh.. yeah.  BEWARE  you might find this guy at a concert. he wears bike glasses so that he can aerodinamically soar to the bar, wears a slipknot hoodie and finger cut gloves. I dont know why everyone knows him, but to say the truth i really couldnt care less.    The pit consisted of 4 people. The slipknot dude and three other kids. well there was a big guy but whatever. The reason of why you cant make a pit in a 1x1 four people space is that you cant move around. these guys were waiting for the other guy to finish so that they could punch the air like a moron. Then there was the human windmill. who moves his arms so fast you can actually see them.     &nbsp;   basically the concert sucked. i did enjoy listening to neginot though. I told the bar dude to get some ear plugs or he'd go deaf.     &nbsp;   There was also this little 5 year old girl in there. apparently i was the only one who cared, because all those other motherfuckers just laughed at her. i mean, she was with her mom, who worked at the café, but what would happen if you see a hardcore show everyday since you were 5? i mean come on, how can a little girl be in a place like this? yeah anyways. i saw like 6 ppl from school. blah.     &nbsp;   like, everyone at the concert was wearing like 50,000 colones in clothes. what the hell, arent they supposed to be the working class? anyways ill rant about this tomorrow or some other day when i have the time. and i also have to talk about the art exhibition i went to today. it was.... lame. yeah. but now its 11 pm and i needa sleep some. bye bye

        i cant believe where everything is going. this new media, this new thought. yes, be free, be unique, but guess what? everyone is thinking the exact same bullshit that you are, and everybody is a fucking freak. not saying it is bad, but they rub it on your face and it feels like shit. and if you had been in my exact same position you wouldnt be laughing. you would be crying or drugged up somewhere in the country. i made a difference and this is what i got to see: how everyone has gone down to a level where it isnt even WORTH trying to change a thing. anyways. i think i should talk about something nicer, but there isnt anything nice to talk about. oooh how great, youre a fashion victim! and you, you spend your money like there is no tomorrow. and how many people actually care about suffering? no time for things we need while people starve and people bleed. thats what the song says, and none of you will ever move your picture because your explanation of the world is a label with some clothes on it.    and drugs. fuck i hate drugs. whats so cool about doing them? oooh look i drink this liquid that looks like dehydrated person pee and tastes like crap just because everyone accepts it.&nbsp; whats so cool about that? "oh i heard that smoking makes you forguet your problems" it doesnt. it only delays it a bit and then fucks up your health. and guess what? youre a fucking sissy piece of shit if you cant even control your own emotions. ooooh im so tense i need a cigar. you lame piece of degenerative crap.    second, everyone just acts like a total asshole. im getting bored of you all trying to act to some stupid rule of society, and deep inside i know that none of you are like that. stupid two faces, bunch of motherfuckers. heres a little secret of my own: I hate you all. im just waiting for the day when you will die so that i can live my life happpily ever after without having to worry about your stupid prejudices. sick of your dirty looks, of your inching away, ASSHOLES.    so yeah, the world is going downhill and im staying on top of it to watch it fall. maybe its just for the kicks, i dont know, but i surely dont wanna be part of this thing you call "being cool". jesus.   &nbsp;

      So lets talk about the art expo. In a word, you can say it was... lame. It was a glass-fusion, wood carving, sculpture, painting expo. O.o yeah. It was three artists, dont remember their names but who cares, i mean, they sucked! ok lets rate the painings:  Annoying. The guy just grabbed a brush, dipped it in his six color staedler kids paint, splotched a bit on the paper and "there you have it, its a volcano!" bleh. and then he folded the paper to make a "visual effect" on the art. on the volcano. i mean, come on,  the paintings sucked .  &nbsp;  ok now the wooden things. its basically a piece of wood that has een shined out. then you make three little holes: the boobs, and the stomach. then in the holes put a stone in them and it looks like a pregnant person. you know what the worst part is? that  every single wooden carving had the exact same shape !&nbsp; Then there was this piece of wood that had like writen "ove, love, lo ve, lo ve?" written on it. then there was a dick right below it. this was probably the worst thing in the WHOLE exhibition. i mean, i think the guy who wrote this crap really wins the prize.  &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.funfreepages.com/prize/yourock.jpg  &nbsp; So what the heck, i realy wrote that on the guest book.  &nbsp;  uhm now there comes the glass things. ok its pieces of pearlescent crushed between two glassplateswith different colors. it was generally a triforce with different colors inside a circle. if thats art, well good riddance.  &nbsp;  some of the sculptures were cool, but they  were all the typical "girl coming out of a rock" thing . there were about 5 of these. if i was gonna make a scuplture, id make batman climbing out of a stone with a hotdog in his hands and name it "scotch tape" and it will have a better name than evryone else's art. and i will become leader of the world and paralize you with my lazer beams.  &nbsp;  but thats just me.

      and i wonder, how many so called "punk rockers" do something?  because singing about it is certainly not gonna do anything. id like to see a singer climb down the bandstand and start a march. but they wont do that. all our heroes are dead or corrupt. - international noise

        These last months&nbsp;I had being watching the news about the the situation between Mexico and the&nbsp;United States. Like most of you may know the U.S. don't wants&nbsp;to allow&nbsp;people to pass through the border between these to countries.&nbsp;I really comprehend this action made by de U.S. since, among the average foreign Mexican in the U.S., there are&nbsp;drug&nbsp;dealers and people you wouldn't like&nbsp;in you country if you are a straight president&nbsp;with a high and strong moral. The problem I have with them is that they generalize making everyone look like a drug dealer. They complain about us being the ones that sell the cocaine, marijuana, and so on, but I wander who are the stupid that buy it? Where ever you go in California or Texas or any of those states that are close to Mexico, they see you as just another Mexican that came here because, either we cross the border to see&nbsp;what the land of the free is all about&nbsp;or ether because they are so merciful that saw&nbsp;you and saw the misery&nbsp;you were living in&nbsp;your tree house with a roof made out of palm trees' leaves. Mexicans&nbsp;went&nbsp;there because the U.S. crashed Mexican economy with their NAFTA&nbsp;starve-to-death-agreement in the early 90's. Whether you are Brazilian, Venezuelan, Ecuadorian, or Nicaraguan they see you just as another pathetic-ignorant-country-music-lover-Mexican with no&nbsp;right to look at their pair of omnipotent eyes. These discrimination and indifference to latinos irritates us creating a situation just like the one you have with the black people. I wander why is it. Your politicians, they are making a fascist country out of yours and that's because&nbsp;you discriminate,&nbsp;you are afraid of everything that is different from you, black, Latino, Chinese, Indian, all those so called "minorities" are just what you are afraid of because they aren't minorities and you know that.

       ¿Qué es la paz? La verdad es que no sé. En un mundo donde los políticos no son nada más que fascistas enmascarados con hambre de poder y guerra, uno no puede distinguir entre blanco y negro. ¿Qué clase de personas elegimos para que nos representen me pregunto? Tenemos lideres obsoletos que sirven para nada mas que destrucción la tan llamada “sociedad civilizada”, que no es más que un circo de payasos y malabaristas que de intelectuales y humanistas. El mundo en el que vivimos no es nada más que la decadencia del ser humano. Hoy no se puede sembrar y cosechar frutos para mañana. La&nbsp; sociedad de hoy es una banda de cuervos que en el momento más inoportuno arrancaran el ojo del débil y el necesitado. Muy pocos se preocupan de los demás. Esos tienen que ser nuestros futuros lideres. Seamos solidarios, compartamos ideas, seamos consistentes con las ideas y miremos hacia un futuro unido, porque en el momento más insospechado, va a venir la maquina a destruir todo para fortalecerse y en ese momento no habrá mucho que hacer. Todo el mundo estará entontecido con las ropas de marca, autos de lujo, y en sí será una sociedad consumista.

      gueeeeno. hace unos dias estaba en el parque de daiversions aca en costa rica. lo linda que es mi costa rica y su bonito monopolio de parque de diversiones. :)  aunque por un lado es bueno. osea, quien querria hacer un parque de diversiones en costa rica? O.o pero bueno. estaba en uno de esos chunches de agua.. como se llama? el que no es el reventazon, el... ese. mis contactos aqui me dicen que es el pacuare. mushas gracias. bueno. llegando al final de las escaleras en el pacuare, ustedes pueden observar que detras suyo, volviendo a&nbsp; ver para las afueras de nuestro afamada construccion, se ve un caballito. si muy bonita la yegua esa, pero lo que uno no se da cuenta es QUE EL COCHINO CABALLO ESTA DEBAJO DE UNA ANTENA ELECTRICA INDUSTRIAL.   y no tengo nada contra la electricidad. no soy como el mae "rebeldon que no prende el microfono porque esta tan enojado con el sistema que no usa su corriente electrica". no no, mis segnores, no estoy aqui para discutir esas... "cosas". solo les queria decir: como se va industrializando/ poblando/ "desarrollando".  osea, di si, no me voy a poner en varas de que es malo para el ambiente, porque aca ya todos lo sabemos, y si, entre mas edificios y menos arboles tenga un pais, mas "desarrollado" lo es. pero que raro que la gente necesite esto. di, no les propongo la solucion porque soy muy estupido e ignorante como para averiguarlo (y la verdad me da mucha pereza, no joda, toy en vacaciones) pero les meto el problema aunque sea por la nariz para ver si algunos de ustedes (ya que son todos tan "inteligentes" y estudiosos) saben que hacer. yo no. pido una patada en el culo.   y como my compita aqui abel pachuco dice: muchas gracias.

      Meh. Been feeling a bit depressed and empty lately. My parents are starting to lecture me everyday. 'Tis a real bitch. They're always telling me I'm too hateful and angry, and they're so damn nosy. Searching my room, always looking at me suspiciously. I know it's only because they care about me, but I can't help but feel annoyed and slightly pissed off.  Anyway....I got a phone call from someone I didn't even know today. It was....weird. She knew who I was, but I had no idea who the fuck she was. =\&nbsp; The conversation went something like this... Me: *picks up* Hello? Her: Is&nbsp; Angela there? Me: This is her. Her: Oh hi! This is blah blah blah. (Note: she didn't really say "blah blah blah", but I was distracted and didn't hear what her name was) Me: Ummmmm....hi Her: Do you know me? Me: ....I don't think so.... Her: I'm one of Olympia's friends. Me: Oh, cool Her: Have you seen me? Me: ......I don't think so.... Her: Oh. Are you going to Timpview? Me: Yeah... Her: Cool. I might go. Do you know anyone that's going there? Me: Errrr...just some of the people from our school. Her: Oooh, do you know blah blah blah? (Can't remember who she said) Me: No.... Her: What about Cecelia? Do you know her?  Me: No.... Her: Do you know blah blah blah? (you get the point) Me: no.... Her: dang, you don't know any of the people Olympia hangs out with! Me: Heh. Her: Do you know Cruz? Me: Yeah.... Her: Cool. You know Javier right? Me: Yeah..... Her: *launches into long story about how Javier is moving to Springville* Me: Fun. I know people who live there. Her: Cool. Are you Mexican? Me: No.... Her: I always thought you were Me: Nope, sorry. Her: Are you Mormon? Me: No.... Her: Are you Catholic? Me: No.... Her: So you're nothing, eh? Me: I suppose you could say that... Her: Well, I have to go! Me: Bye. o.o  God. That was an awkward conversation. Considering that I had no idea who she was, and all. I hope she didn't think I was rude. ^^;;;;  Ugh, anyway, I'm off to post in my LJ, then study for my English exam (WHY ME?! *screams at the sky). Night all.

      today i was buying swimtrunks cuz were going away to the beach tomorrow. so i was in the dressing room,trying to put on the trunks (i also realized my pants weight a lot? O.o) and there was this really crappy/commercial reggae on the radio... and the music ended and then the dj started accepting phone calls.   most&nbsp; of them were rants about the government, so here's one i snatched into my memory:  why does the government spend all that money on tourism and not on rebuilding the goddamned roads that we have?  i mean comeon, the roads have like huge holes in them and what does the MOPT do about it? they start drawing hearts on the street?! HWY DO YOU HAVE THAT STUPID GUY IN CHARGE?!   and what would happen if they actually got to fix the streets? more tourism! because the gringoes get bored of crappy roads, dont you get it?! how many gringos have ever set foot on say, [insert name of remote place in costa rica here]? why? because theyre not gonna spend four hours in a grav-- i mean, swamp type of road, just to get to a goddamn beach/thing/whatever.  so i say, get better roads, get better tourism. invert on tourism, and you only get a bunch of gringos infesting the local mcdonald's up.  *licks the reader*

      If youve read the last two blog entries from esteban and messeguer you may already know that i (gurdian)&nbsp;am being hunted down.&nbsp; People in 07 are too proud.&nbsp; They think they are so united but still they exclude and pick on people.&nbsp; I have started my own little revolution against it and&nbsp;the AGUANTE&nbsp;constantly tries to crush it.&nbsp; It all started when i got drunk at a party and insulted the kiddies there and pablo and manu tried to beat me up.

       First of all I will have to explain what does&nbsp;"aguante" means&nbsp;and what does the "aguante la&nbsp;'07" means as well. "Aguante"&nbsp;it's&nbsp;like to confront something with brave, so you can guess what does "aguante la&nbsp;'07" means (for the ones that couldn't guess it, it is like "you can do it generation '07"). Generation '07 claims to be a united and powerful generation in which everyone is an&nbsp;important part of the generation '07 society, kind of like communism, including the dictatorship part of it since if you are not part of it they want to kick your ass up to your face as you could see with the rant Felipe did about Friday's party in Pablito's house (if you didn't then do it). Now the truth is that this unity is as true as George W. Bush being a "peace president". On our generation (or class) many people is bullied everyday (in school days), like Gay J (he deserves it since he is annoying) Patricia, Mow Mow, Tatiana, Oscar... And the list goes on and on. I personally have being bullied for about&nbsp;two and a half years, which means I have being suspended and have had to fight some of the persons who bullied me. The curious thing about it is that some of the people who bullied me now are trying to be nice and sometimes it pisses me off, because I think I have more friends in other generations than in this generation '07, and when someone who bullied me&nbsp;found&nbsp;me talking to someone from other generation they start being hypocrite and start acting like they have always being my friends. Now you can like have an idea of how is our generation. These doesn't means there are good persons in the class, but unfortunately there is more bad than good in my opinion, like for every 5 persons 2 of them are cool. This ratio is not objective since it is my opinion. Now back to the main theme. If this generation is united then why the bulling? That's because it's not true. If someone deforms your face no one will care about it in fact they will just stare a you wail they do it. Our proud generation also comes with its own home page:  urlLink  www.tuleparty2nite.4t.com  . At the beginning it was owned by Tufo, Fabro, and Chris (friend of us). Then Fabro left and came in Carlos, there it start the reing of stupid polls. They first made a poll which said: Who is the most freak in our generation: in which featured Felipe, Gurdian, Tatiana, Daniela Montealegre, some other persons I don't remember and me. This poll was made by our hypocrite (according to what people have told us) friend. Then it came another poll in which it said: Did you went Patricia's party, options,I wasn't invited, No, Yes, I don't fucking care. In the comments they start to making fun out of her. Finally I post a page long comment complaining about this generation and our friend Chris delete the poll. Now the web page is mainly owned by Chris since Tufo doesn't care about it and Carlos left the web page. I think mainly that's the main stuff about the problem and with that, you reader, can see our opinion. Thanks.

      So! Review of last night's "party"!   *ahem* ok first of all, whoever wrote down those instructions and directions on how to get the is like an idiot who shouldnt have been born (pablo?) i mean, a brick colored house with two palms on it? thats like so totally perfect, considering that every  goddamn house in the place was brick colored and had at least two goddamn palms on it.   Even if you DID follow the instructions, you would've ended like two blocks down the road, looking at the guardhouse. probably in the park with the rocks (park with rocks? wtf?). but i got there! after like 8 phone calls. xP&nbsp; but pablo is an idiot. its like "keep going! now turn to the left, turn to the left again, again, and turn to the left! youre there! (if you noticed, i just made a turn around the block) god!    So i was there in the terrace/livingroom/thing next to garden/bar and kinda bored. like, chris making out with manuel's sister (o.O) and blah. and everyone talking about how they wanted to beat gurdian and estebitan up. its like   pablo: "DID YOU HEAR?! i wanna kill gurdian! he's such a loser! i mean, he actually told me that i wasnt a true 07'er! can you believe it?!"  manuel: "DUDE! what an asshole! do you wanna beat him up?"  pablo: "yeah! thatll teach him!"  daniel: "When he comes, i join! and i wanna beat estebitan up!"   and hte convo goes on, but you get the idea.   but i mean, what the fuck, even chris got mad at me for saying "he's kida tright about it" and he like gave me a strange look and stuff. O.o;   so yeah, if any of you get into a fight, i get in, im not letting everyon beat you two up. (ill get my ass kicked too, but not so badly haha)    but the party was kinda boring. i mean, what the hell? i arrive there and people (drunk) start talking about my edge. what the fuck? and its all like: "what do your fist say?" "uh... drugfree" "WOW!" "uh.. yeah." and then they start talking to like each other, and these two "punk" kids (who seem like they just got out of the quiksilver store, with beanie and all) start talking to me about punk. O.o;   one word: i dont care! one more word: I cant count!   who the hell wants to talk about punk? its like:  kid: since when are you edge?  me: like 3 years ago.  kid: cool.  me: uh yeah.  kid: you like hardcore?  me: uhhunh. you?  kid: yeah..  me: like what bands?  kid: uh... crass and uh.. green day.  me: ok.  kid: you?  me: [dump bandlist here]  kid: oh. ive heard minor threat!  me: good. i uh.. gotta go.

        Esta misma noche del&nbsp;25 de julio del 2004&nbsp;a las 0:18 am. Felipe Gurdián y yo (Esteban Alvarez) comenzamos el plan para un nuevo movimiento llamado “Unidos sin Hipocresía”. Este movimiento tiene 7 pasos fáciles de seguir si nos da el apoyo que necesitamos para que funcione (Messeguer esto también es para usted).&nbsp;     &nbsp;    1) Todos tenemos que ponernos el mismo nick en MSN:  -¡¡¡¡¡VAMOS A UNIFICAR ESTA GENERACION Y DEJAR DE SER HIPOCRITAS!!!!!  Seamos honestos tenemos una generación dividida y no podemos sacarnos este nick por nada  2) Explicaremos este plan a dos de nuestros amigos (Robin y Jose) y pediremos su ayuda  3) Pondremos propaganda que incite a la unión de esta generación alrededor del Colegio Lincoln  4) Pediremos a la gente que defienda a los molestados y los ayude  5) Hacer reuniones o “fiestas” y vamos a poner a la gente a q se siente y hable de este nuevo cambio y de la forma hipócrita q muchos hemos actuado entre nosotros  6) Vamos a mantener esto con constancia y con fuerza y con esto también buscamos q la gente no se pelee y q la gente se apoye si no es mucho pedir  7) Cada paso que se cumple se tiene que hacer con ganas y con fuerza para que la gente vea q este plan no es cualquier estupidez que no va funcionar como el anterior. También vamos a tratar de mejorar este plan con propósito de mantener unida esta generación   Estos pasos necesitan de constancia y de empeño así que por favor el que lea esto sea fiel a nuestra idea. Y para Messeguer, Jose y Robin: tenemos que mantenernos en  contacto todos los días , absolutamente todos los días y comentar sobre esto para ver como van nuestros planes. Gracias. Ojalá esto no sea para ustedes más que letras al azar y que de verdad esto signifique algo para ustedes, porque al final esto nos va a ayudar a todos.&nbsp;        A final word, wait it's not a call to action. We ain't no sect we ain't no fucking faction. Unity unity you’ve heard it all before. This time it's not exclusive we want to stop a war. Unity as one stand together. Unity evolutions gonna come. – Operation Ivy

      okei ya estoy harto de toda estra mierda de que si los mae playos se pueden casar o no.  primero que todo, me gustaria acalarar que TODA ESTA MIERDA sobre estar casado o no es un monton de picha. que significa estar casado? todacia no se para qué el registro civil quiere saber si uno esta casado o no. me parece una imbecilada. es como que en su cedula saliera si ud tiene tele o no. a quien le importa? toy seguro de q a mis apreciadas figuras de autoridad no les importa.  ahora, para que tanta mierda de que los playos no se pueden casar? okei, diganme PORQUE PUTAS NO!?  porque va contra la iglesia? y que?! entonces para que dejan que hayan nightclubs por toda la ciudad? porque matan gente? porque es que los pedazos de mierda que se estan quejando TAMBIEN HACEN PECADOS?!  porque desde mi punto de vista es lo mismo serplayo que cometer un pecado: sigue siendo un acto contra dios.  ahora, no es que tenemos que mantener la distancia entre el estado y la iglesia? ahora, QUE PUTAS ESTA PASANDO AQUI?! porque lo que veo no es gente discutiendo el tema con un apunte objetivo, son un monton de playos de la iglesia quejandose de que dios no quiere esto y dios no quiere aquello y si no lo hacemos nos quema la casa. saquen a los padres de la tele y de los periodicos! porque con uno de esos cogechiquitos aqui no va a cambiar nada.  y que pasa con la gente que nisiquiera es catolica? esa gente q se casa con omo 20 zorras porque les da la gana? esa gente que?! no es que se merecen un voto en esto? AH PERO NO! los unicos con derecho a discutir son el padre minor y mister bush. no me jodan, al chile, si van a empezar con esta mierda al menos hagan algo con otros temas como "porque es que todos los padres son unos violadores?" no se pongan a discutir con los playos. hasta donde yo se, ellos no pasan violando a los menores como ustedes.  bueno, y mi punto final:  en conclusion, yo quitaria la vara de poder casarse "civilmente" porque estaria enfocando solo un lado de las religiones. no todo el mundo es igual. que se quite la posibilidad de casarse! y ya no hay mas problemas!  p.s.: a los playones que se quieren casar bajo el nombre de la iglesia: no pueden. metanselo en la upa, monton de estupidos. eso es como querer unirse a una secta satanica porque le gusta dios. es como hacerse sXe porque le cuadra emborracharse. es una imbecilada. callense y den una buena discusion, no una mierdita sobre jesus.

      I've decided to post the tab for part of one of my favorite guitar riffs. It's from the Goldfinger cover of 99 Red Balloons. I've never seen it tabbed this way, on any sites with guitar tabs, but I prefer playing it this way.  Goldfinger plays it with heavy distortion, which is why it sounds spiffy.  E------------------------------------------------------------------ B------------------------------------------------------------------ G----------------------------------------------------------------- D--------------------4h6p4------------------------------------------ A----7-7-4h7p4-------------7-7-4h7p4-------------4h7-------------- E-----------------------------------------------7-7--------------------  Click  urlLink here  for the tab of the whole song. There are mistakes in the solo, and possibly in other places, so watch out for those. Other than that, it's a pretty good tab.  Note: blogger won't let me post the vertical line-things, which is why the tab looks messy.

       so what the heck are people thinking.  actual news in costa rica:      (transcribed from my memory)      "some random guy from the states wants to come into costa rica to search for gold in somewhere blablabla. this will give costa rica more money and more jobs. bla bla bla"      ok i mean, WHAT THE FUCK.      id like to point out that this guy's 'gold search' is going to be sponsored by the govenrment. BY THE GOVERNMENT. JEBUS.      and theyre not even fucking sure if there is gold in the place. what if there's no gold in the goddam area? well the government, not the guy, will have spent millions of dollars to find out that theres no gold, they just fucked up the environment, and they have an external debt because of some weird treaty the country made. (like always)      what jobs is it gonna give? because they always say "oh, its gonna give jobs" but its bullshit. they usually do this: ok lets bring 40 locals and make them work 10 hours a day at minimum wage for a year. after that, they fire them all. jesus man, that was hell of a job oportunity, specially when the next people you hire are stupid gringo tourists who propel sexual tourism. go figure.      out of the gold that is extracted, how many of it is the country gonna keep? this are the things that my beoved president would probably do:      1- donate the gold to the US for no apparent reason   2- share the money among themselves   3- spend the money on building roads, which translates to having Ignacio Santos buying cars with the money, or making random amounts of cement poke out of the roads, ike you can see near plaza del sol.   4- give it to the guy who promoted the gold thing.   5- give it so that we can "boost tourism" which means sped it on nightclubs and more advertisements of night clubs along the road   6- give it to the church, so that priests can become richer   7- give it to me. ill make good use of it, trust me. xD   8- give it to the MEP, so that THEY CAN ACUTALLY PAY THE TEACHERS   9- im out of ideas.      well you get the idea.      second, why would i want to help them make this proyect? so that the president can become richer and NOONE noticing? fuck off, im not paying my taxes for that.      can you imagine the enviromental damage? ok lets see:      -the biggest erosion that costa rica has ever seen, apart from the teca wood.   -lots of dead fish because there's no water   -less frests, more dirt roads   -houses having entire mountains falling on them      well you know. read mamita yunai. whats going on right now is the same as to what happened 70-100 years ago, in the book. (i donno when it was. sue me.)      i say, fuck the proyect. thats not the goddamned way to go. and if youve got a problem about it, im fucking waiting.          NO REFORMATION WITHOUT  REVOLT

      CONFLICT LYRICS  The Guilt And The Glory (How Many More Lies)   Do you know that at least 70% of the human population of this planet starve and many more do not get enough to eat? You must now be familiar with reports of the famine In Ethiopia, where the weather has been so dry that crops fall, where the people are so hungry they have to walk many miles to the nearest relief station where there might be food If proplr have been generous. In any one station at least 40 people a day die. totally shriveled. They haven't the energy to brush away the flies that are waiting for THEIR meal. These poeple are the victims of our western governments. In Britain alone there are massive great food stores where surplus grain sits, In the EEC there are food mountains, In Amrerica farmers are paid to destroy part of their harvest, while big corporations plunder the 3rd world countries at the expense of the natives. Why Is this - economics, the science of greed. That which says people must pay western prices for their food. Natural starving countries can't afford this especially when their government takes the best fIrst. The western government have plenty of money. They tax us on our income, then they tax us on what we buy. They take the money we have worked for and use It to buy arms. They would rather be able to destroy the world 12 instead of 10 times over than transport surplus food to those who die. Indeed, they become 111 through obesity. Must we tolerate these obscenities? When soon even we may be starving because of their taxes. Some people don't see the connections between big bussiness and destruction. The biggest murderers are MacDonald's. Not only do they breed and slaughter millions of cattle, great rain forests are pulled down to make way for grazing ground. This destroys hundreds of unique species each time not to mention the fact that we need trees to produce oxygen for the planet. Many birds In North America migrate to these forests, on arriving and finding no forest they die. The drop In population of birds means more insects and the Americans only answer to this is pesticide. We all know about factories who manufacture pesticide, you know about Union Carbide. They're an American Company who set up dangerous plants. It doesn't matter, nearly 3,000 Indians are now dead due to their callousness, thousands have strokes and injuries that will never heal. Innocent people who had done nothing, whose life is not easy anyway, and why? So America can steal food from the starving millions. Nearly all big bussiness, is based on explanation of the worst kinds. Cosmetic companies use dead animals to make their products, then poison many more by feeding it to them with the end result of encouraging sexism by convincing men and women to look the same as each other. Advertising promotes this and advertising of any kind usually portrays women as a sex object only, there to be raped. Drug companies (like Roche &amp; ICI) claim to Invent new drugs to cure Imagined diseases. Thousands die at the hands of their useless research. They try to make drugs to cure heart disease which was originally caused by the sufferer eating meat and dairy products to excess. Booker McConnell own everything from butchers to health shops, as long as the cash rolls in who cares? Other companies who make machinery and domestic appliances (like Thorn EMI.) also makes defense gadgetry. British Aerospace specialize In fighters in favour of passenger jets. Governments pay more for weaponry that domestic consumers pay for domestic items. That's why many many comapnies world wide clamour for defense orders, some would go bankrupt without them. The final Industry, uranium mining, sponsored in Britain by RTZ plunders the landscape, kills the wildlife,exploits the natives and gives them cancer. The product makes bombs to kill all and 15 used for nuclear fuel. The kind of power that produces waste which can be pumped Into the sea In Cumbria. Deformed babies and children dying and leukemia are coincidences we are told. how many more lies must we listen to?

      What the fuck is everyone thinking? i mean, they get mad when they find out this psycho guy kills cats, but theyre all too happy eating their fucking hamburguer. for god's sake.  i showed this link:  urlLink http://www.textfiles.com/anarchy/MISCHIEF/1001cat.txt   and people got pissed off. why? because they couldnt believe i would kill a cat.  "you woud kill a cat? what did the cat do to you in your life?"  at least in my eyes, its the same to kill a cow, than to kill a cat, than to kill a squirrel, than to kill a fish, than to kill a human. youre still a killer, you took someone's life away.  so why do these people complain so much? i mean, maybe i'm not vegan, but if i went vegan it would be for the good of it, not so that only one animal loses its right to live.  anyways, my dad just talked to me so i lost interest in going on writing. i guess you get the idea.  bai.

I FUCKED A SLUT AINT I COOL!?"  it pisses me off. specially the way these people look at girls. "sex object only" come on, you couldnt get worse like that. a girl is not a fucking prize. i could go to any fucking place and get a blowjob whenever i cant, but its just not cool. wow your best friend is a slut so you brag about it, but deep inside you know she has fucked basically every other guy you know. thats not fucking cool. it makes you sound like an idiot actually.  anyways, if what you wanna do in your life is be a "fuck machine" go ahead, but youre no better than anyone else around here, and i dont fucking need you scrubbing it in my face, asshole.  thank you.

      In response to one of Felipe's previous posts:  Sex is supposedly "in" right now. Take MTV for example -- nearly everything revolves around sexuality. If mtv says it's cool, half the teens in the world will think it's cool. The minds of teenagers and children and easy to manipulate, and brainwash. There's really not much we can do about it. I think it's safe to say that more people will believe mtv/abercrombie/etc rather than a few kids who can actually see the truth, or at least something near the truth.  If everyone wants to fuck around, it's their choice. In fact, I have a friend who lost her virginity earlier this summer. She's only 13, and she did it with some older guy. The guy, I've heard, only likes girls who are pretty and easy. I lost a ton of respect for her.   We can hope that they'll understand someday (although hope is usually just a waste). It just sucks how so many people lack common sense these days.

       What are vegans in a short definition: people who try to change the world without thinking too much. The simple fact of not eating any meat is stupid. You say you don't want to become an animal killer, but I bet you eat and wear child-made products and you don't give a fuck. I'm sure you don't think about it when you buy your tasty Milky Way with processed chocolate in a poor African country, or when you buy your Quicksilver shirts or your Nike shoes, I can understand that because you also have to be worried about what people say about you in school. Let me tell you something Tilio told me: ""School" is just a fraction of your life" and that is true, unless you are going to die at the age of 20 and you know it, then you are really fucked up.  I hate those "persons" who call them self humans and claim to be charitative, while they spend 50 cents for every $5 invested in their mascots, to charity. That is hypocrisy not compassion. Showing off their $100 shoes and their father's brand new Porche Carrera GT. I think that's the worst combination in a human being: hypocrisy and superficiality. If you want to be hated for the rest of your life, this is the key for your success, either this or killing the pope and twenty babies, but that is sick and difficult. Today the average human has became blind, shallow, and ignorant. Just like Felipe or Susi (Felipe's alter-ego) put it: Who the fuck cares about you having sex with a bitch! Good for you, but you may end up with herpes or aids or even a child, so now, does that worth it? Now, everyone cares about what's good for him. If you are combulsing in the middle of the street they see you as an animal with nothing to lose and probably most people think you are crazy. Only few are the ones that stop and help you, few are the ones that really care about you and the million persons around them. Those few are the ones that difference us from ants, they don't walk in one direction and fuck everyone who is on their way. They stop and talk to you and gives a meaning to what does being a Human is. If you enter a store nobody cares of saying "Good Morning" or "Thanks", everyone's is thinking "Dude, that's cool, I want it and nobody is going to take it away from me, even if don't buy it ever. Yes! I am a soul-less consumist, BUY! BUY! BUY! MC DONALD'S, QUICKSILVER, CELL PHONES, MORE!!!." Today it is like if you are   the only human left in the world and everyone else is just inferior.  Consumism is another thing is making everyone look like an ant. I say an ant because ants keep walking without caring about the other ants, they only fulfill their mission and nothing else. They don't talk they only work. The only difference between ants and humans is that ants are more consent with what they do and how they do it. We harass with the environment killing the animals and lately killing our selves. The good thing is that at least we are trying to improve and to correct our mistakes, but still not all the countries do that, for example U.S., Kyoto, does it tickles something? If it does then fuck you for doing nothing!!! Continuing with the subject... consumism is what is making us all the same. Disney is the ultimate consumist empire. There you can pay for a hotel and you can buy food, toys, shirts, toys, play in the theme park, and buy toys! You pretty much can to everything there, and since everything is Disney's monopoly in there you just consume. You may be asking your self... What about it? And that is exactly my point. Nobody cares. They just accept it, like if its normal, and certainly it is normal. Everyday we read advertisements, watch advertisements, and some people are even human advertisements. That is not bad at all, what is bad is to buy things that we don't need. Things that are just unusable is what is stupid. You could invest with that money in other things, either for needed people or just throw it at the bank. Other thing that comes along with this problem is than people feel insecure about them selves because they don't fit with the stereotype companies show to the consumers in the advertisements. Many fat people end up having problems for using products and pills that promise you you will lose all the fat in your body, and the ironic thing is that after those advertisements finish Mc Donald's, Taco Bell, Subway, KFC, commercials come in. What the fuck! Corporations are using us and the only thing that can help us decide what we want or what we need is us.  End    PD.: I don't know how I started talking about vegans and finished talking about self determination.

      School starts in a week. Hopefully, I will be able to finish my summer English assignment before then. I really need to get it together, I've only finished about a quarter of the novel. DDD: Schedule: 1. French 1 2. Biology 3. Geography Honors 4. World Civilizations 5. Honors Art 6. English 9 Honors 7. Algebra 2  Blah, I can't believe I'm taking every honors/"advanced" class available for my grade (9). >. I really hope this school year will be better than the last. I got into a ton of trouble this past school year, and I hope my record doesn't carry over to the new school. I'm kind of annoyed because I have Geo Honors and World Civs with a really annoying Star Wars fan who loves to argue with teachers over stupid topics. It would've been nice if 9th graders could take US History, since my expertise includes The Civil War, but World Civs and Geo Honors will be fun too, I suppose. Yeah, yeah, enough of my ranting over school subjects. I'll just end this now, since I seem to have nothing else to write. Ta.

       this is a current event i have it due this friday for US HISTORY so its is full of shit.  Article:   urlLink  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3549408.stm                This article is about the rise of oil prices in the world setting a new record in history. This is caused by the menace Iraqi militant cleric Moqtada Sadr set after rejecting calls to end the fighting. This implies that Mr. Sadr may sabotage refineries and pipelines in Iraq since Sadr followers had taken over the cities of Basra, where 90% of Iraq’s oil exports go through. Iraqis officials shut down the plants to avoid a possible attempt of a terrorist attack. This reaction caused the rise in prices. In the article also talks about the impact Yukos may have with this. Analysts say it will take about six weeks for the effects to come.             It is pretty obvious that this is a great problem the world is undergoing. The simple fact that oil has made a new record in prices alarms everyone. If oil prices are high, then, considering that much of world’s oil comes from the Middle East, countries around the world will suffer its effects. Another problem within the subject is the effect it may cause to Yukos, which is one of the world’s biggest oil companies, since if it haves a big impact on Yukos economy, then prices will go even higher aggravating the problems.

       hoy me conto mi amigo felipe de ese comentario q puso ud. me parece bien q piense de esa forma, pero me gustaria q escuche al menos mi opinion antes de saltar a concluciones.     primero me voy a presentar. me llamo esteban alvarez y estoy en el hueco de la lincoln. si, seguro ud esta pensando... otro hipocrita q juega de ser revelde sin causa... pero dejeme decirle q yo no soy asi. agradesco a dios todos los dias por haberme suituado en una familia q tiene el dinero para darme d q comer todos los dias y para darme la educacion q "nesecito". esto y mas siempre pasa por mi mente y ...pienso q ojala pudiese ayudar en algo servir para algo, ser algo mas q un digito en el registro civil... tambien ha de pensar ud q yo soy un hipocrita por qjarme del colegio licoln y a pesar de ello seguir alli, pero sabe por que lo hago? porq yo pienso q si yo estudio y me esfuerzo lo suficiente podre ser alguien para cumplir mi anelo. suena como q si me interaza la politica pero no. yo qiero ser medico y no un medico vendido q nada mas le interesa ganar mas dinero, yo qiero ser un verdadero medico. a lo mejor no le interesa saber en absoluto esto, pero dejeme decirle algo... con esto qiero q vea q yo no soy cualqier otro superfulo de la lincoln, yo ya encontre mi proposito en la vida.  a mi personalmente no me gusta conciederarme un "punk" porq eso es ser un "poser" y a mi no me gusta rajar en ninguna forma, pero como ser humano y por mi imperfeccion como tal, a veces lo hago, y despues pienso lo tan imbecil puedo ser. yo no busco su aprovacion ni tampoco su amistad, si la consigo de alguna forma me es indiferente. lo q qiero q qde claro es q yo no soy un "punk" ni "rude boy" por q es una "moda", a mi me gusta esta musica y la lirica en ella q me hace pensar... yo tengo el poder para hacer una diferencia. tal vez sea solo un sueño nada mas... tal vez sea nada mas estupides... pero quiza sea posible, y gracias a esta ultima yo soy qien soy.  en nuestro "prestigioso colegio" nosotros somos odiados. quiza sea porq nosotros qeremos q la gente como nuestros compañeros de clase habra los ojos y vea lo q pasa en el mundo, pero no la gente es cerrada y discrimina. a ellos les gusta vivir en su burbuja y nada mas. yo personalmente solo tengo 4 amigos en toda esa muchedumbre y lo ironico de todo esto es q esa gente nos odia por ser diferentes y qjarnos del factor comun en ese colegio, la superficialidad, y tratamos de ser simples lo mas posible, y en la otra mano los proletarios nos odian por "tratar de comprenderlos".  me da pena q ud haya tenido q vivir todo lo q vivio en su infancia. pero creame yo trato de cambiar el mundo en q estamos, y si.... ojala algun dia nos encontremos... para ver que.

      the cafta agreement destroys the environment, american companies come to third world countries and destroy the land. when the soil wont produce any more, they leave the country, sell the land back to the government, and go on destroying other countries.  the companies that come here do not produce any jobs. sure, the government says "oh this new hotel they are building will bring jobs to the area" but what the companies do is to hire locals for a month, fire them and then hire americans to work there.  the companie's wastes are thrown into rivers, which then spread an epidemic across the country. the municipality or however you call it in english wont do anything about it, because the local company is constantly giving them money, so they wont do anything. have you ever been fired because you didnt give out a permit to some random conpamy you dont even know? because giving out the permit would be illegal? therefore, if any problem arises, you are the guilty one. but the mayor keeps acquiring money, and if you dont give the permit, he wont get money, and so they will fire as much people as needed just to get 100 bucks  people do not need an american company to come into a 3rd world country to fuck around with the poor. did you know that if we want CAFTA to exist, all 3rd world countries would have to close every company currently on a monopoly? did you know that almost every country depends on these monopolies to exist? why? well most of the money goes directly to the government. the government, in exchange, gives free services to the lower classes, and people without economical advantages. if there was no monopoly, the country would probably go un-communicated, most parts would have no more electricity or phone lines. the american countries that come would also come in with really high prices, and probably the middle class wouldnt be able to afford it. The high class would be the only ones getting any services, therefore they would be the only ones aware of what is going on in the country.  what for? so that the gap between rich and poor can widen? so that the people with money can puppeteer what goes on inside the country?  did you know that after the treaty is signed, any copyrights made in the country will belong to the united states' government after ten years? what does this mean? that if i write something, the author will be the united states. that the united states can change whatever they want to change, whenever they want to.  did you know what happened to mexico after the agreement was signed? they had an economical deficit. sure, the u.s. says "oh mexico's economy rose like hell after the treaty was signed" bullshit. we all know what really happened to mexico. after walmart came into mexico to exploit the comercial areas in the country, the country lost mos of its money, and then the economy "rose" when they had to sell the national bank... to the U.S.  for what do we need any american countries? doesd america really need to steal more money out of poor people? do they need to come in here to destroy the country? why do i have to say yes to anything that a pissy gringo tells me to do? since when do i follow orders from someone who enjoys killing people? if theres someone who needs the be the US's yes-man, let him be, but im gonna stand against him with everything ive got. so that the americans can laugh at me and spit on my soil? no thank you.

      Today was the first day of school. It was -horrible-. DDDD: I have like no friends in any of my classes, and even worse, ALL of my classes are infested with preppies. The only class that wasn't infested with freshman preppies was my Biology class-- which the freshman preps were too stupid to get in to. XD  Unfortunately, I have to deal with the sophomore/junior preppies in that class. And my World Civs class is mostly sophomores/juniors/seniors, according to the teacher, which doesn't make me feel any better. And I thought I had it bad last year, when I had all these loud annoying smart alec skaters in all my classes. Now it's worse. I actually wish the skaters were back in my classes-- they actually had a decent taste in music.  Yeah. I got lost between all my classes too. -.-;;;  Timpview has god damn ENORMOUS, long, hard................................................................................................ buildings.  I suppose the only classes I'll be looking forward to this year are French and Honors Art. Hell, I don't know if I'll even be looking forward to those. I have a test tomorrow too (in my English class). What the fuck....on the second god damn day of school. DDDD:  God.  School is already making me want to fucking hurl myself off of a tall building. *pounds head into a brick wall and screams*
