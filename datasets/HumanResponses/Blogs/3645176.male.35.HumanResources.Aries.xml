						   "This is an interesting exchange."  It is absolutely ignorant to state that one who does not speak "Spanish" is cannot claim to be Hispanic. There have been Hispanics in the present area of the United States of America (Santa Fe, Los Angeles, Albuquerque, etc...) whose ancestors have been here for over four hundred years.   Another point to make is that if an African-American does not speak "African", then do you not consider them to be a minority or African-American? Would you disqualify them from a minority based scholarship if they did not speak any of the languages from the continent of Africa? No, and to be quite honest it would be very unethnical. So, to get to the point, it is wrong to condemn Hispanics because they do not speak Spanish and it is wrong to make the statements that you made about their not being a minority.  Posted by: J. Smith on April 16, 2004 08:31 PM   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- "I had to respond"  J. Smith,  You said, "...if an African-American does not speak "African," then do you not consider them to be a minority or African-American?"  How does one speak African? I did not know that there was such a language?  You have a lot to learn before you speak on this subject. That is evident in your use of the term "African-American." Can you tell me what an "African-American" is?  Daniel  Posted by: Daniel E. Smith on May 26, 2004 03:10 PM   urlLink Go here to see the entire list of postings

						   "As you can see I've visited this subject before."   The Honorable Hannah-Beth Jackson 35th Assembly District, State Capitol P.O. Box 942849 Sacramento, California 94249-0035  Dear Assembly Member Jackson:  Governor Elect, Arnold Schwarzenegger plans to reverse the legislation Gray Davis signed regarding the granting of California drivers’ licenses to undocumented immigrants. I was troubled to read in the October 9th, 2003 edition of the Ventura County Star that there was little sentiment in the legislature to go along with his plan.  I do not agree with the arguments put forth by the supporters of the drivers’ license for illegal immigrants. I believe that Governor Davis felt much the same way, even as he signed this “give away” legislation into law. He was counting on support in return for rewarding those who would circumvent our laws…as we now know, he was wrong.  As a world traveler, I can make my point with a few examples. First, I was driving in Belize with nothing more that my California drivers’ license, my passport and my visa. I was stopped at a checkpoint where I was asked for my ID. I gave the officer my drivers’ license and my passport and I was sent on my way. In addition, I have traveled to, and driven in, Mexico with nothing more than my California drivers’ license. The point of these examples is that, they knew who I was, why I was in their country and how long I would be staying.  If we cannot answer with certainty who someone is, where they are from, why they are in California and how long they will be staying, they should not have the right to drive here, or even remain in the country. If we do know these basic facts about someone, let them drive using their own license and insurance in the form of a bond. It’s that simple. Moreover, imagine how we as Californians would look if someone like Muhammad Ata was flashing a legally obtained, DMV issued ID?  I urge you to assist Mr. Schwarzenegger in his effort to bring back validity to our drivers’ licenses and mend the security gap left by Gray Davis’s act of desperation. Please urge your colleagues to overturn this law that rewards the unlawful and helps those who would harm us blend into the mainstream.   Respectfully Submitted,  Daniel E. Smith

						   June 16, 2004   The Honorable Arnold Schwarzenegger Governor of the State of California State Capitol Building Sacramento, California 95814   Dear Governor Schwarzenegger,  I noticed today that SB 1160 (a bill that would allow illegal immigrants to receive California drivers’ licenses) is moving its way through the state Legislature. I am not writing to tell you the reasons why it should not become law, but rather why you cannot let it become law.  Last year many Californians, myself included, recalled Gray Davis and elected you to keep illegal immigrants from receiving drivers’ licenses and to repeal the car registration tax increase. We did not elect you to expressed reservations about parts of such a bill, or to work to find common ground, but to kill it…and you know this.  I was happy when you made good on your promise to repeal the mistakes made by Gray Davis; I think we all were. However, now that SB 1160 is in the news and apparently working its way towards your desk, I’m getting worried. You need to make a stand, publicly, against SB 1160, in any form or any bill like it.  I like you and I will stick with you if you stand strong against this attempt to harm our state. Simply put, if California grants drivers’ licenses to illegal immigrants then someone else will be our next governor.  Sincerely,  Daniel E. Smith

						     - FORMAL COMPLAINT AND REFUND REQUEST -   MAY 6, 200X   FROM:   DANIEL E. SMITH VENTURA,CALIFORNIA                                          TO:   BRUCE THOMPSON, SERVICE MANAGER HARBOR CHRYSLER                                                   STATEMENT OF ISSUES    On January 31, 200X I brought my wife’s 1995 Chrysler Cirrus (VIN# 1C3EJ56H1SXXXXXXX) (hereafter “the car”) into Harbor Chrysler for repairs. The car had an intermittent shifting problem with the transmission, flickering instrument lights and a rear defroster controller that turned on and off erratically.  In order to repair the transmission’s shifting problem your technician(s) replaced the Solenoid Valve Body at a cost of $484.14 (invoice #XXXXX). It was also recommended to me that the A/C controller and something called a “Multi Function Switch” be replaced to correct the flickering instrument lights and defroster controller at a cost of over $550.  Replacing the Solenoid Valve Body did not remedy the problem for which it was brought in, and the car continued to have problems shifting passed second gear. Furthermore, I fixed the flickering instrument lights and defroster controller by cleaning and tightening the ground cable, which was loose and easily diagnosed. After this first visit to Harbor Chrysler at a cost of $484.14, I had a car that was not fixed and recommended repairs in excess of $550.00 that were completely unnecessary.  On March 14, I returned the car to Harbor Chrysler for the same shifting problems of the initial visit. A second diagnosis was made that called for the replacement of the Transmission Control Module (TCM) (invoice #XXXXX). Again, I trusted your technician(s) and authorized the repair to the sum of $129.77. Authorization to replace the TCM was given with the stipulation that it was being granted on the basis that a new TCM would be the cure to the shifting issues. This repair did not improve the shifting and the problem became more frequent.  I returned the car on March 19, 24 & 26 in hopes that Harbor Chrysler could find the problem that had now cost me a total of $613.91, as well as an unacceptable amount of time and grief.  On March 24, your technician(s) advised me that the car needed a new wiring harness installed at an estimated cost of $1,850.00 (invoice #XXXXX). Also, when the car was returned to me it was permanently stuck in so-called “Limp Mode” and would not shift out of second gear. Basically, the car was restricted to about 20 MPH and had to be driven home on surface streets while making frequent stops to allow traffic to pass. This was unsafe and a complete waste of my time.  My wife works in XXXXXX about 40 miles from home and since this is her only car, we needed to have it repaired as soon as possible. I decided to get a second opinion and paid to have the transmission opened up to get to the cause of the improper shifting.    STATEMENT OF FACTS    1)	On April 8, 200X, I had the clutches and seals in the transmission replaced by an independent shop because they were in fact worn. I personally inspected the pieces and saw that the clutches WERE black from wear and the seals WERE hard and flattened. My wife has been driving the car for almost a month now and the problem has not resurfaced. 2)	 Out of fairness to Harbor Chrysler, I allowed almost 30 days to see if these independent shop repairs would hold up, and they have. 3)	The replacement of the Solenoid-Valve Body and the replacement of the Transmission Control Module by Harbor Chrysler did not fix the problem and therefore were unnecessary repairs totaling $613.91 4)	Harbor Chrysler’s recommendation of replacing the wiring harness for $1,850.00 was also unnecessary and would not have fixed the car; the car is operating perfectly now in the absence of a new wiring harness. 5)	The competency of your technician(s) must be called into question for not finding a loose ground cable and instead recommending over $500.00 in repairs that would have not remedied the flickering lights or defroster control switch. I am not joking when I say I was able to fix this problem in less than an hour; most of that time was researching the symptoms using the Internet.    SUMMARY OF COMPLAINT    Had I continued to let Harbor Chrysler make the repairs that were being recommended, I would have spent approximately $2,400.00 and I would still have a disabled vehicle. With so much money involved and a car that was still not fixed, I fear that resolution would have been almost impossible to reach. I believe that my decision to get a second opinion saved money and time for me as well as you.  Harbor Chrysler has wronged my wife and me to the sum of $613.91. This amount must be refunded to us as soon as possible. With the references to “Satisfaction” printed on your invoices and the mail-in cards you leave in the cars, it appears as if you take the customers’ satisfaction seriously. As you were the ONLY person that treated me with concern and respect during this ordeal, I hope that you will be able to “Satisfy” my wife and me. I am prepared to take further action if this matter is not resolved.    HARBOR CHRYSLER NEEDS TO RESPOND WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF RECEIPT.   Respectfully submitted,   DANIEL E. SMITH

						   June 16, 2004  The Honorable Tom McClintock State Capitol, Room 3070 Sacramento, California 95814  Dear Senator McClintock,  As a citizen of California, I am concerned with the aim the ACLU has taken at the city and county seals that depict a cross. I am sure you are aware that in the City of Ventura we have had our own problems trying to keep the cross at Grant Park.  I would like to know if a statewide declaration can be made that would take the cross off the table as a purely religious icon and proclaim it, as well as other historically relevant icons, as a symbol of California’s heritage worthy of protection. If there needs to be a ballot initiative to enact such a proclamation, I would like to know what would be required.  Being able to refer the ACLU’s challenges of the cross to the State level would save the cities and counties a great deal of money in replacing their seals, as well as move the fight in to an arena where the ACLU could be deal with.  At this time, the challenges are being met with officials that are fearful of the price of fighting. Some things, history included, are worth fight for.  I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this matter.   Sincerely,  Daniel E. Smith

						   Ted,  "Neo-McCarthyism?"; No, it's the free-market at work. If 99% of the hate mail were anonymous non-readers then your employer would not give a crap. When they start loosing customers is when they take action.  Free speech, free-market...it's all free - here anyway. So say what you want to say and we'll buy what we want to read. Where is it said that one must be able to sell their opinion? You can sell it if you want, but we don't have to buy it.  We like people like Michael Moore, Al Franken and Bill Maher as long as they are NOT on our side. Also, the louder they are the better. Al Franken and Bill Maher can make a living in comedy…they are talented and really funny. You and Moore would be a harder sell.   You say that the Right cannot compete in a battle of ideas, yet it's the Left that sinks to name calling, screaming and theories of conspiracy. Such attacks do nothing to help anyone; except maybe the neo-slave drivers (the Godless, Multicultural, Socialist types) in Washington. For the record, those of us who really appreciate diversity (me) would never do it such a disservice as to mandate it and cram it down peoples' throats.  Get real man, we choose our politics based on out ideas. We do not get our ideas from politics. So you are wrong in believing that your critics are a bunch of zombies hyped up on Limbaugh, ready to do the bidding of some political party. We’re all different and do not belong in a box with a label on it.  Daniel

						   Ted,  I took some time to go back through your archives and, you know, I think I like the oddity know as Ted Rall. Let me list the reasons why:  1. You keep up with Rush Limbaugh, WAY the hell more than I, a Republican, do...and carefully I might add.  2. You are SO easy on Kerry that it's almost an endorsement, and that can only help Bush.  3. You go on something called "Air America" (a subscription radio show I think) where the idiots will love you and everyone else will see you for what you are...and hopefully draw a link to you, the ACLU and Democrats in general.  4. You go on Fox to help their already booming ratings.  5. You get down in the gutter with all of your fowl-mouthed emailers that for some reason you think are Republicans. Waste you time on them...I don't know who they are, but registered voters I'll bet they are not.  Thanks Ted!  Daniel

						   After reading Ted's reply, "Teddy, Are You Queer?", to some hate mail I had to respond.  Ted,  There you go again. You are missing the point. Nobody really cares who you choose to "partake of sins of the flesh" with; except maybe the person who sent the email. Nobody really cares that you hate Bush and Reagan; it's how you choose to say it.  It's not "dimestore [sic] psychology" at all…it's just a careful observation. People who have a "mad at the world" attitude usually have some, not so deep, reason for it. I've seen it too many times, especially in homosexuals and people who've had a rough childhood, not to notice it in people like you.  Homophobia, what is that? The people I know and associate with, many of them Republicans like me, do not use this term...we have no reason to. When we (Republicans) say we want a strong defense or lower taxes, we don't mean just for heterosexuals. You need to free yourself from the labels and name-calling.   So remember, we don't care if you are queer or not. We don't care if you hate Bush and Reagan. We do care that you, as a semi-national personality, are distasteful, rude and do nothing to promote healthy disagreement about policy.  Daniel

						   Ted,  I have to respond to your remarks about our beloved former President Ronald Reagan and American hero Pat Tillman. Your remarks were insensitive, ill timed and just rude. I don't think worms like you know or care what service to your country really means. I also am compelled to comment on the tactics you use to shield yourself from what is true and just.  When responding to USPropMgnt you attack only the syntax of the email, not the content. This was a childish retort. If debating is an art, then this tactic is the "finger-painting" stage of the form. When you cannot refute what is said, attack how it is said or who said it. I have seen this used a thousand times by those who are not really mad at the person on the other end of the debate, rather just mad. Mad because their parents were drunk or high all the time, pissed off because they were picked on as a child or angst-ridden over not being able to be themselves because even they are ashamed.      In your response to an email from junky54 you said, "They actually think we can win in Iraq...That's what you get when you rely on Fox for your news." What's wrong with Fox? They let people like you come on to express ridiculously unpopular views.  As for winning in Iraq, you should refer to what the objectives were. First, that Saddam and his sons must leave Iraq. I'd say that two dead and the other deposed and in custody is a win on that point. Also, Iraq's weapons and weapons programs of mass destruction must be opened up to full inspection and eliminated as a threat to the world. This has also been accomplished. Also, removing Saddam from the business of supporting the families of suicide bombers. This has also been done.  There is also a quiet victory in Iraq…one that you can add to the list of things you fail to understand. By invading Iraq, our President made it the arena for the world's terrorists to make their last stand; not New York or London, but Iraq. It's much like the concept of a lighting rod. Offering an able and specialized part in an area that you are most likely to be struck, but in a way that you are most prepared to deal with a strike. This simple and effective plan has lead to the death of many of the world's terrorists. Terrorists who would kill shameless people like you just as fast as they would a kind one.  I will have to say that I get a kick out of watching you on Fox in much the same way I get a kick out of watching shows on the KKK and the Nazis. Crass people spouting their elitist views…people with no right to claim superiority over anyone. What makes this so entertaining is that you think you are the smart ones. A fool that knows he's a fool is just a fool, but a fool that thinks he's the smart one...well, that's comedy.   Also, reading your hate mail from other fox viewers is quite entertaining. It is the labeling of your detractors as some kind of illiterate right-wing Bush brigade that is brainwashed by Fox News that shows your true colors. As people like yourself tend to do, you throw a label on people in order to dehumanize and attack them, often turning one "group" against another. I'd bet that many who write to you have no party affiliation and no history of voting. Many may not be able to find Iraq on a map, but that's some of them. Some are Republicans, some are Democrats and some are people who just don't like you because of the distasteful things you say.  You need help Ted, help to work through your issues, but not from me. It's going to take someone with a hell of lot of alphabet soup after their name to get you to open up and set your tortured soul free.    Daniel

						   June 16, 2004  Paul Stafford, Winemaker Turning Leaf Vineyards P.O. Box 1130 Modesto, California 95353   Dear Mr. Stafford,  I am writing to thank you and the entire Turning Leaf organization for consistently making great wines at a great price, as well as making them widely available. Over the last eight months my wife and I have had our first child and I quit my job to start my own business. Admittedly, times have been a bit tighter here than they once were, but thankfully one thing has not changed, I am still able to enjoy my favorite wines.  Even before life in the Smith household changed so dramatically, Turning Leaf California Merlot and California Cabernet Sauvignon were favored for their balance, their body and the consistency of these elements from bottle to bottle. Especially now, I am grateful for the value of Turning Leaf wines because I would not want to drink a bad bottle of wine at any price. I have found your wines to be better than many others, others often at three or four times the price.  Please make sure that everyone at the vineyard knows that their efforts are greatly appreciated. For you, Mr. Stafford, I thank you for making Turning Leaf wines everything wine is supposed to be. As things go on changing here at home, I will continue to drink, to share and to gift the wines of Turning Leaf Vineyards.  Sincerely,   Daniel E. Smith
