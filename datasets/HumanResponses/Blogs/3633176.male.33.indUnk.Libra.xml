      Where do we draw the line? Class issues are not being discussed by either political party.  What are our options?

      I have taken a break from teaching to get a taste of real life.  The saying "Be careful of what you wish for" definitely holds true here.    There lies the irony- in order to confront such issues one needs to see how it plays out in reality every once in awhile.   Ha! I am experiencing the joys and pains of management as a woman of color- where it can be used to fit  a quota or image but seen as a viable threat at the same time.   The workplace in many ways does not differ from the classroom.  All actions are contigent on the environment/structure in place.  If predjudices and stereotypes are to cease it will only happen when all players take an active role to ensure this happens.  How often does it happen in either environment- work or classroom?  Or for that matter in the home?      What are the risks in the workplace for one to confront such issues or is it greater in the classroom? How do our social constructs intersect in either positive or negative ways?
