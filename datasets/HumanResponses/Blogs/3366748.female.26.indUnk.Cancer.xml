      I really enjoy having a job where I can work like a dog overtime for six weeks, and be off for six weeks.  However, when I don't have anything planned for the off six weeks, I tend to get bored.  Like this six weeks, I am off and I don't have anything planned.  I am taking some internet distance learning courses for the summer session, but they don't start until June 1.  I tried to access the courses, too, and it won't let me until the start date.  Dammit.   I have decided to take whatever I can through distance learning, because of the busy 6 week period at work.  During that 6 week period, we travel a lot and are often gone from 5 in the morning until 10 at night.  I know it sounds like a bitch, but that's what I get for getting 6 weeks off every three months.  When I get to a point where I can't take anything dl anymore, I am going to sh=chedule all my classes for Tuesday, Thursday, and just be unavailable those days.  Which sucks, because during the busy 6 weeks, two days off is a LOT of money, but what can you do?   I spent today on a mission.  I wanted to cook or bake anything I could with whatever I had on hand, (no running to the store for one thing allowed) and then freeze it for a later time.  Thank God for allrecipes.com where you can enter ingredients you have, ingredients you don't have, and it comes up with recipes for you.  One recipe that came up that sounded really good was tres leches cake.  But the problem was, was that I only had 2 leches.  I only had regular milk and a can of evaporated milk.  I didn't have "condensed milk".  I wondered what would happen if I made dos leches, but decided against it.   I eventually got to use the can of evaporated milk in banana cake.  The banana cake smelled so good while it was baking.  It is now in the fridge.  Good for breakfast for me and John over the next few days.  I also made a really sad excuse for an ommlette, but with ketchup it was really good.  John ate most of it when he came home for lunch.  I made peanut butter cookie dough and froze it for when I am ready to make cookies.   Cucumbers were on sale at food city, 6 for a dollar.  I also had a coupon for Italian dressing, and with double coupons, I saved a dollar off of dressing that cost 1.99.  I got these bargains yesterday, and made a big cucumber salad, chopped up whatever tomatoes and chives I had in the fridge, and saved the salad in the fridge.  It's really good!!!

      My relationship with John- Sometimes I wish it had happened five years ago.  When I was younger, I was obviously much more romantic than I am now.  I can remember being younger- and it wasn't all that long ago, like 4-5 years ago- and dreaming about the day when I found the "one".  Back then, I had all these little romantic fantasies about "being with the one I love" and doing all kinds of wonderful things for him like buying his favorite snack and leaving it on his desk with a bow, and talking all mushy, and going for walks in the rain, I mean all these little romantic things.  Most of them I can't even remember now.  I always saw myself being just soooo in love and sooo trusting, and soooo mush talking.  I always dreamed of being a super wife and mom, especially a mom.   Thinking back, I think that all just went away as soon as people around me started threatening me with, "You better find happiness in yourself".  "No man's going to take care of you".  "Don't count on men, you better take all you want in a man and find it within yourself".   So scared shitless, I did.  Over the next few years, I did as I was supposed to- "found happiness in myself" instead of with a forbidden MAN, got all independant, tried to rid myself of any desire for a husband or children, because it was "The thing to do".  Of course, I mean marriage oppresses women, and I had to be "independant" and prove it to all the jilted women barking in my face that having a man in my life could never be a good thing.   Four years or so of this, and John comes into my life totally unexpectedly.  We click big time.  For the next few months, I forget about how I'm supposed to be all womynly and not want a man, and just focus on how great John is and how wonderful it feels to finally have someone in my life to talk to, that's not some catty ass woman.  Before we know it we're in love.  Not like overnight or anything, I am sure it took time.  I don't know when it happened.  But John is like another half of me.  I love being his partner.    The only problem is is that I feel... well not guilty about having a man in my life, but more like ashamed.  Ashamed for finding happiness with a man when it's only supposed to be about happiness with myself only (and maybe a cat if I find myself *GAAAASP* longing for a child). The shame causes me not to be as close or romantic with john as I would like.  Don't get me wrong, we have had our romantic episodes, but it's not like they're every day or anything.  The shame causes me to actually lie to people I meet and say that I'm single, because I'm afraid they'll be feminists and dog me for it.  I'm afraid to hold John's hand in public and display PDA for fear that there will be a feminist lurking who will think that I'm some kind of sorry ass excuse for a woman for actually being with a MAAAAAAANNNN.  Feminism terrorizes me.  I have always felt just shaken to death over not being one.  I can't help not being one.  But I still fear their wrath, sarcasm, and how they can't get any kind of freakin point accross without displaying this spouting anger.    It's something I will have to get over if I want to actually allow myself to fully love John.  I do love him, but it's so hard to be close to him after all these years of feminism being shoved down my throat.  It's definitely something I will have to get over if I have a baby.  The last thing in the world I ever want to find myself in is finding out that I am pregnant, and succombing to all the mother fuckers who are going to insist on what a horrible thing that is, instead of being happy for me.  I so look forward to being a mother.  I also look forward to being a mother without guilt that I am doing something wrong, that children just RUUIIINNNN women's lives and pardon the fuck out of me for being thankful that I brought this child into the world.  I look forward to so much in the future.  I just wish that shame left me.

      I knew what the definition of a Christian testimony was.  In the past eight years that I had been a born again Christian, I had sat and listened to more individual testimonies than I could count. Prior to the introduction of almost every one, there seemed to be a need to give the definition of a Christian testimony over again, just in case there was an unsaved person, or a baby Christian in the house that did not know.   At descipleship group, however, all 10 of us college age young women were mature Christians, and no one needed definitions of every day born again lingo.  Even so, the night of "Testimony week" in descipleship group, our group leader April decided to be formal and give one anyway.   "A testimony is when you tell people what the Lord has done in your life", she began.  "It's simply your own statement of how you have been changed since having Jesus Christ in your heart." We all nodded in agreement, sitting in a circle in April's living room, wondering who would go first.  After a minor pause of awkwardness, Jennifer cleared her throat and said, "I'll go first." She was already starting to cry.  Choked up, she stated, "This is very hard for me".   But everyone was supportive.  That's what descipleship groups were all about; small groups of people caring for each other, being an encouragement to each other, opening up, learning, studying the Bible and praying together.  Our community church was rather large, with more than 2,000 people.  The college age youth group alone was over 500 strong, since the church was located just a few miles from Arizona State University.  Since the college group met twice a week on Tuesday nights and Sunday mornings with almost all 500 attendees every week, our pastor divided us up into groups of 10-12, men with men and women with women, so that we could meet in homes and study with each other on a more personal level.   Now that it was testimony week, it was about to get even more personal.  "I was raised Catholic," Jennifer started, still choking up.  "So I was raised to believe I was saved, just because I had been baptized as a baby.  I never questioned anything, I just took my parents word when they told me that I was Christian.   "Then, when I was 12 years old, my parents announced that they were getting a divorce.  My father moved out, and I hardly saw him after that, maybe once a month or so.  It was very hard on my brothers and I to be without a father in our lives, not only emotionally, but it was a financial strain on my mother as well to be a single parent.  We had to move from the suburbs to a small apartment in a bad part of the city.  My brothers started acting out, and my mother attributed it to their being boys without a father.  In her eyes, it was worse to be a boy without a father than to be a girl without one, so she paid more attention to them." Every eye in the room was now filling up with tears.  "After I started high school, I got into some very unChristian things.  All the other kids were doing drugs, and so I started doing them, too.  I got into marijuana and alcohol.  I started practicing witchcraft.  I was going to parties almost every weekend, and when I was 15, I started having sex.  It started with just a one night stand with a boy from school that I hardly knew, but after that, I couldn't be without a boyfriend, and all throughout high school, I went from boyfriend to boyfriend.  I think because I didn't have my dad around, I became so sexually active in order to make up for having a lack of male roll model.   "When I was 18," she continued, "One of my friends introduced me to Jesus Christ.  Of course, I thought I already was a Christian, being Catholic and all.  But my friend helped me to realize that the life I was living was not holy.  She helped me to realize I was a sinner, and I think at that point in my life, I was tired of living that way.  I was tired of meaningless relationships with men, and the party scene.  I wanted something real for once in my life.  So I prayed with my friend the sinner's prayer.  I repented of my lifestyle, repented, and asked Jesus into my heart.   "Right away, there was a change in me.  I stopped doing drugs and I stopped drinking.  I went to church or Bible studies any chance I could get, and every time the door was open.  Jesus became the man I was looking for, to hold onto, to rely on, and to be a Daddy to me.  I no longer needed to have a boyfriend in my life.  Jesus was the one to fill me up the way I needed to be.  I even went to a purity class, and said a special prayer to be forgiven of my sexual past.  I was given a ring of purity from the teacher and vowed not to have sex again until I got married." All throughout the room, there were sighs and tears, and some of the other girls were whispering, "Isn't that awesome?", or "Isn't God wonderful?"  A few people hugged Jennifer, as they all cried.  Tissues were being passed around the room.  After a long pause, April took center again and asked if anyone wanted to give their testimony next.   Again, there was a pause, and finally another girl named Jessica raised her hand and said, "I'll go." "Well, I started having sex when I was fourteen," she started.  "And like Jennifer, I was using boyfriends to fill that void in my life that I should have been filling with Jesus Christ.  I think by the time I graduated high school, I had been with over thirty men." There was a slight gasp around the room.  Jess continued, "My life was just a downward spiral.  When I was 17, I found out I was pregnant the first time.  My parents kicked me out of the house and I was forced to live on my own.  I went to live with a new boyfriend of mine, not the baby's father- the baby's father had left me when I told him about the baby, and this was someone new I had already met by the time I was 4 months along.  So I moved in with him, and it was wonderful until the baby came along.   "After my son was born, my boyfriend started getting violent and started hitting me.  When my son was 2 months old, I left him and lived on the streets until I found another boyfriend.  I moved in with him, and in a few short months, I was pregnant again.  However, this time it was no different.  The father of my second child was violent as well, and even kicked me in the stomach when I was pregnant.  I ended up in the hospital with internal bruising and delivered my daughter prematurely.  She survived, miraculously, and I went to live in a domestic violence shelter.  They helped me to get a job, and out on my own, and after I got on my own, I met a new boyfriend who was really sweet and nice to me- not something I was used to.  However, I mistakingly got pregnant again, and as soon as I told him, he started becoming abusive to me as well.  This is when a friend introduced me to Jesus Christ.   After I got saved, I felt like I had this peace that I never felt before.  Men had always hurt me, but Jesus would never let me down.  Through my church, I learned how to find strength as a single parent and how to get along without men.  Being a single parent is so hard, harder than you can ever imagine.  But because of the Lord Jesus, I am able to do it.  My favorite verse in the Bible is that no weapon formed against me shall prosper.  Every time I read that, I am reminded of how strong I am because of Christ, and that I can do it through him, and through him only." Again, more tears filled the room, more tissues were passed, and more hugs were given.  Again, April took center and asked if anyone else wanted to go, and again, more girls stood up and gave testimony after testimony, each one seemingly more dramatic than the first one.  Each one containging more and more promiscuity, divorced parents, drug use, and the like.   Before the night was over, April turned to me, because I was the only one who hadn't "Gone".   I sat there kind of dumbfounded, not knowing really what to say.  There wasn't a whole lot I could say.  I was 20 years old at that point, and for almost half of my life, every single Christian testimony I had heard contained at least three of the necessary components that made testimonies so tear jerking- promiscuity, drug use, single parenthood, divorced parents, and/or absent father figures, being raised Catholic, being poor, living in a bad neighborhood, being molested by someone like mom's boyfriend, etc.  The number one problem that I faced at that moment was that my life contained none of those components.  My parents were married.  I never did drugs, unless you count the one time in junior high when a friend blew marijuana second hand smoke into my face and I got a contact high.  My father was present in my life, I lived in the suburbs, we were not poor, I had never been molested or suffered any other type of abuse.  And to top it all off, the real doozy.   I had never had sex.   Therefore, I was not a single parent, and understood nill about using boyfriends to fill voids and such.  I had had a boyfriend in the past, but there were no voids, and the furthest we ever went was making out without shirts.   I remembered a time when I was sitting in church listening to the pastor, and he gave the story of the woman at the well, who had had five husbands and was currently living with a man who was not her husband.  In the Bible, this woman met Jesus, and repented and turned away from sexual sin.  I remembered my pastor using her as an example to teach us that those who had more sin in their pasts (like having sex), and ended up getting saved and repenting of these sins, tended to love God more than those who had less sin in their pasts.  Hence the quote from the Bible, "He who is forgiven of much loves much.  But he who is forgiven of little loves little." In remembering this quote, I looked at all the girls surrounding me and felt low.  They had all been forgiven of "much", and therefore, in any really really strong Christian's biblically logical point of view, they loved Him more than I did.  Even though it seemed logical to most Christians I knew, in my heart, I felt differently.  There had been many times in my life when I felt so close to Christ, that it could only be described as love.  There were all the times I sat in my room reading my Bible and feeling that overwhelming peace of the Holy Spirit, all the times I stood in church singing hymns, and feeling that strong sense of love come over me that I only got during worship, all the times I prayed, but didn't know what to say to the Lord, and all of a sudden got an a-ha moment of the fact that it did not matter that I didn't know what to pray- it just mattered that I came to him in the first place.  In my young mind, on the inside, the only words that I could have possibly used to describe these moments with God were love, trust, belief, and surrender.  But at the time, I didn't know how to use those words to describe my experiences with the Lord.  On the outside, things were different.  In church, there were constant challenges in the pastor's sermons, challenges which made us question ourselves, and examine ourselves to find out if we were "really saved" or just "Talking the talk".  The constant challenges which made me examine my "real motives" for doing things like praying, coming to church, or reading the Bible.  In sermon after sermon, those of us listening always seemed to be asked in a condescending tone that automatically suggested a negative answer, if we were "really" believers, or "Just thought we were".  Were we coming to church because we "Really wanted to know God", or did we just want to come to see our friends.  When we prayed, did we "Really talk" to a God we "really believed in" or were we just murmuring words in our heads and not directing them at God?  When we sang in church, were we "Really worshipping Christ" or were we just singing, without any heart put into worship?  Something about the tone in which these questions were asked always made me just automatically disregard any faith I had and any spiritual experience I had as ungenuine, and give into the pastors' perception of me from way up there in the pulpit as not having "real" faith, and having to somewhat start over in my faith journey.   It was that scrambling, inadequate inner struggle, on top of the fact that my visible past hadn't contained any of the necessary sad components for a tear jerking testimony that made me speechless when April called on me to give my testimony.  At the time, inside, I was screaming, Oh, God, oh God, how do I get around the fact that I don't actually have a good testimony.  In what seemed like a moment of desparation, I thought, well, maybe I can lie and say that I was promiscuous, too.  But I right away thought, no that won't work.  What if they ask me some exposing questions like what kind of moves I used, or how often did I experience orgasm? But it wasn't just the inability to describe sexual peak that I was worried about.  It was the inability to describe that one moment that they all knew so well- the moment when Jesus came into their hearts, and from then on, it was just all happily ever after.  Jesus was their daddy now.  No more doubts, no more sins, no more dark moments or times of desparation and tragedy.  Their lives were just all gloom and sadness before the moment and all peaceful and joyous after the moment.  In my 20 years, I had not had a moment like that.  In their eyes, perhaps it meant that I was not really saved, which was why I couldn't admit it.  But I honestly also couldn't give such a cookie cutter testimony the way they did, despite the fact that my life contained none of the necessary sad components.  It didn't mean that I didn't have a story to tell, even though that's what I thought at that time.  Every human being that has ever lived on this planet has a story to tell.  Mine was just, not only different, but also too complex to fit into a five minute oratory beginning with parental divorce, sex and drugs, peaking with the moment of accepting Christ, and ending with happily ever after- never again being lonely or doubtful, sad or full of anxiety.   One of the millions of things that ran through my mind as April and the others starred at me actually was my first experience being exposed to Jesus in a born again atmosphere.  But I wasn't smiling fondly at the memory.  I was agonizing over the fact that it didn't mesh.  I could only make it sound so after school special-ish.   "Well" I started, with my voice shaking.  "I was 12 years old and in the 7th grade." They nodded, all looking at me with support, and kleenex, and happy smiles, all getting ready to cry at the perfect moment.  "And, uh- I came home from school one day, and when my dad got home from work, my parents told me that they were talking about putting me in a private school.  They were starting to get uncomfortable with the public school.  You know, drugs and all." "Did you do drugs?" Jessica asked.  "Oh, uh, uh, no I didn't," I replied.  "I mean, once.  I did marijuana once, only I didn't really do it.  One of my friends just... just... blew it in my face.  And I got high just a little bit and well, that was it." They all looked at me dumbfounded.  "Well, um," I continued.  "I was in 7th grade then.  And my parents told me that they found a Christian school in the next town which was a non-denominational Christian school.  My parents are both Greek, so they belonged to the Greek Orthodox church.  My mom was under the impression that 'Christian school' meant all Christian denominations including Greek Orthodox, but it was really just Baptist." "What's Greek Orthodox?" one girl in the group asked me.  "Are you Jewish?" "No," I replied.  "No, I'm not Jewish.  Orthodoxy is similar to Catholocism.  The difference between Catholicism and Orthodoxy came like a thousand years ago when the Eastern countries like Greece, Russia and so on split off from the Catholic church, but it's still very similar to the Catholic church, only with minor differences." "Does your family pray to Mary?" April asked me.  I replied, "No, well, not exactly.  There are a lot of saints, but I think a lot of the saints are different from the Catholic church's saints.  I'm really not sure.  I never really got into it.  By the time I was old enough to understand, I had already started going to the Christian school." "Oh", they all seemed to say.  Jennifer told me, "So you probably never learned about who God really was, either, huh?" In essence, I wanted to tell her no, I didn't.  For the sake of going along with the crowd, I kind of haphazardly made this into the typical "I was raised Catholic" testimony, only I was raised Orthodox.  In reality, I did learn about God in the Greek Orthodox church.  Granted, every service I sat through as a child (which wasn't that many since my parents and I were Christmas and Easter Christians) consisted of nothing but chanting, so I never actually got anything out of the services.  I did however, occasionally go to church camp, and Sunday school where I learned about Christ.  My parents also taught me things from the Bible at home.  Ironically, even before I "got saved", I periodically felt the presence of God, even when I was a little girl.   It often came as I starred at a Byzantine icon, or watched my mother light a candle in church, or smell the incense in church.  Other times, it came as the seasons changed from winter to spring to summer to fall, and I would step outside and feel this cleansing, refreshing excitement as I breathed air that was different than that I had gotten used to breathing over the past few months.  I often sensed God when I prayed as a little girl, and can remember praying as far back as my memory can take me.   But in the 8th grade, in my first days at the Christian school my mom had heard about, in the midst of being the new kid in school, getting used to strict dress codes and smaller class sizes, I quickly learned about the plan of salvation.  In the mornings, we either had chapel services or Bible study.  Monday, Wednesday and Friday, it was chapel, and Tuesday and Thursday was Bible study.  In chapel, we always heard a sermon about either the plan of salvation, or some Christian issue like why evolution was false, why rock music was a sin, or why we should listen to our parents.  Attending services like these were total culture shock for me, since the only services I had ever been in were Orthodox ones, with nothing but chanting.  The very first time I walked into one of these chapel services, one of the first things that ran through my mind was, that I didn't know how Baptists made the sign of the cross.  I knew that Greek Orthodox people made it with the first three fingers touching together, and that Catholics made it with none of the fingers touching.  But I had never known how other denominations did it.  In my mind, I pictured them all doing the sign of the cross with the thumb, or perhaps the thumb and pinky, instead of the Orthodox way with the thumb, middle and index finger.  Needless to say, I was mildly surprised when, on my first day of school, after the first opening prayer, I opened my eyes, lifted my hand to my forehead, and looked around to see no one crossing themselves.  Improvising, I used my hand to kind of wipe imaginary sweat off of my forehead, pretending that the imaginary sweat was the reason I was touching my forehead, and not because I was about to make the sign of the cross.   My other adjustments came from the fact that the Baptist church preached in English instead of constant chanting in foreign languages.  So instead of being the squirmy, bored little kid, kicking the pew and constantly asking mom if church was almost over, I now was able to listen and actually get something out of it.  I don't know exactly when I first learned about the plan of salvation, but I do know that it was very, very soon after starting school there, because the plan of salvation and being saved was all anyone ever really talked about around there.  I can't remember the date like most other Christians can, but the very first time I accepted Christ as my savior was typical of many people's experiences.  I went up to one of my teachers after school and told him I was ready.  He took me into a corner, explained the whole thing again, just as I had heard it in chapel that morning; how in the beginning, God created Adam and eve, and he created them perfectly; then Adam sinned against God by eating fruit from a tree which God forbade; and how since then, men and women have been destined to an eternity in hell for a punishment for their sins; but 2,000 years ago, God sent his one and only son to be the once and for all sacrifice for all of us; that whoever believes in him and accepts his gift of salvation will be saved from all sins, and will go to heaven, instead of hell; and that all I had to do was pray- "Dear Jesus, I know that I am a sinner.  I repent of my sins, and I accept your gift of salvation.  I believe that you died on the cross and rose again, and I invite you to come into my heart to be my lord and savior.  Thank you for saving me.  Amen".   When I prayed the prayer with my teacher, that very first time, right away, the only thought running through my head was that I was so relieved and glad to have the truth.  I kept thinking that if I had spent the rest of my life in a chanting Greek Orthodox church, I probably would have never heard the plan of salvation, remained lost my whole life, and ended up going to hell.  The feeling that came over me at that moment was total complete relief.  So when my teacher asked me, "Do you feel any differently?", I was able to answer, "Yes" and be telling the truth.  When I told April, Jennifer, Jessica, and the other girls at descipleship group that story, I found myself getting choked up a little bit at the memory, but as I looked around the room, I noticed that no one was passing kleenex for my story.  Instead, they were all looking at me with forced smiles.  There was something about the looks on their faces that said, "That's it?  Just an 8th grade school girl from a chanting church backround?  No sex, no drugs?  No horrible chain of boyfriends, no abortion or domestic violence?" After a long pause, April cleared her throat and through that forced smile, told me, "So basically, your testimony is one of being blessed." "I don't understand," I said.  April said, "Well, while most people have testimonies of what God has done for them in their lives, yours is more of a testimony of how good he is to his children, and how he can remain faithful and continue blessing us." I grimaced.  If that was the politically correct way of saying, "Your testimony sucks" then I guess I could live with that.

      Dear Rebecca, You may not remember me, but I wrote to you a long time ago.&nbsp; I absoltely loved your book "To Be Real".&nbsp; In fact, I often pull it out and read just your preface when I occasionally feel like it.&nbsp; I have not really read any of the following chapters, just your preface, because it puts into words precisely how I have felt in the past about being in feminist surroundings. So many times, it feels like the feminist movement abolished one "only way to live", only to create another "only way to live".&nbsp; I have beat myself up so many times over doing things in life which seem "unfeminist", only to later realize that it isn't my choices or my confidence in myself to make the right choices that I feel stupid about- it's my intimidation of the feminists in my life, mainly because they seem to manage to express themselves with such hostility most of the time. I am 26 years old and have trickled through college the past 8 years, taking one class at a time, two at a time, off for a year, and so on.&nbsp; However, I was not unsuccessful.&nbsp; for the past eight years, I have remained debt free while living on my own, working full time, doing meaningful volunteer work and even got to travel out of the country a couple times to do volunteer work abroad.&nbsp; I have always been the person who wanted to do things now and not four years from now like all my friends.&nbsp; College was an accessory and not a necessity.&nbsp; With regards to getting married someday, everyone always gave me the same advice- Do not get married until you are fully and completely in love with yourself first, or else marriage will only hurt you.&nbsp; I took their advice one step further, which seemed to step on a lot of feminist toes in my family.&nbsp; I applied that principle to college as well, telling myself, if I can't be successful without a degree first, then how will I be successful with one?&nbsp; When I explained my philosiphy to my mother and aunts, you could see non-verbal daggers followed by a quick insinuation of, "Well, that's not exactly what we meant". I was also insecure about going to college while living on my own.&nbsp; I was afraid it would interfere with work, and I would be unable to support myself.&nbsp; I also dreaded the idea of being over busy and dog tired from "doing it all". When I got married this year, hell broke loose.&nbsp; In the eyes of the feminists in my life, my whole world was over.&nbsp; They assumed that I was some kind of Cinderella in distress, only doing this because my life was shaky and my self esteem bad.&nbsp; In their eyes, clearly it was the lack of education.&nbsp; I got all kinds of warnings about the divorce rate, demands that I spell out my whole life plan for "Just in case you break up", testimonials of every bad marriage and more.&nbsp; I got silent treatment, screaming treatment, you name it, but I still got married.&nbsp; My husband is my best friend, and the most calming person I have ever met.&nbsp; If I did ever end up divorced from him, (which is unforseeable), I would be upset for a short while, but underneath it all be eternally grateful that I got to spend X amount of years with such a wonderful person.&nbsp; I don't see the point in not marrying because 50% ends in divorce.&nbsp; That's like saying X amount of people have been laid off and unemployed... better not ever work?&nbsp; I am going to live my life regardless. After I moved in with my husband, I had a lot of problems allowing myself to be close to him and allowing him to be my life partner so to speak.&nbsp; In the beginning, I felt guilty and ashamed for "giving up and getting married" so to speak.&nbsp; I got mad if he paid a bill or vacuumed, or gave me an oil change, because I was *supposed* to be doing this life all alone.&nbsp; When he suggested that I cut to working part time and attend school full time so I can finish my degree, I wanted to, but I was afraid, and rightfully so.&nbsp; Within time, the idea started appealing to me more and more and I finally enrolled in the University full time, and will be getting a bachelor's in social work in about a year and a half or so. Part of the women's movement was giving the women a chance at receiving higher education.&nbsp; You would think that the feminists in my life would be happy, but in their eyes, my efforts are null because I am living with my husband, and not really paying the majority of the bills.&nbsp; I, however, am glad that I can dive headfirst into my studies for the first time since hs graduation.&nbsp; I am excited about being a social worker.&nbsp; I not only get financial support from my husband (That's only a minor part of it), but he gives me mental support, verbal and intellectual support as well.&nbsp; I will be sitting at my desk studying one of my books and he will be sitting accross from me studying another of my books.&nbsp; My mother and aunts always painted a picture for me that depicted men as tyrants, only wanting women to be illiterate, barefoot and pregnant.&nbsp; But my husband is the polar opposite of that.&nbsp; I often feel like I have made one "feminist choice" by returning to school, only to nullify it by making the "unfeminist choice" of living with a man.&nbsp; It makes me feel like crap, until I read that preface in your book, which kind of throws sarcasm and what women are "supposed to" like, dislike, do, not do, etc. One of my goals as a social worker is to create more incentives for more minority families to adopt children.&nbsp; Out of curiosity, I was wondering if you have any views on the issue or would like to offer any tips as to what would be appropriate. I also sometimes dream about becoming a writer.&nbsp; I seem to have 3 or 4 books in my head waiting to be written down.&nbsp; Soemday, hopefully, I will have my own website with a "list of titles" of my own. Thanks for inspiration and humor. Sincerely, Danielle

      &nbsp; next discussion>>   rate this post  Thanks for telling me I don't need therapy! I am glad someone else feels the same way I do about it. Your message was comforting. I am feeling a lot better the past couple of days. You are right, I don't have any "real" reason to go to therapy, I am happy, my relationship is healthy, and my husband is wonderful, and things are going well otherwise. The only thing that I Was thinking of going for was the overwhelming guilt I feel because of my exposure to militant feminism. It came upon me the other day like a ton of bricks because I was overbusy and overtired. One of the haunting things that overwhelms me with guilt is that I am going back to school. Should be a good thing, but the truth is, is that if I was not with my husband, I would not be in school. It was always something I wanted to do, but I never was like those people that had to have it to be a worthy human being. I always thought, if I ever get to do it, then fine, if not fine. I am successful with or without it. When I moved in with my husband, one door opened after another. I Was able to return to an old employer and work only part time, and registered for classes. I am going for a bachelor's degree, and it is a very heavy load. Honestly, I would not be doing it if not for living with my husband, because if I were living alone, I would be working full time and worrying about supporting myself. So in a way, I feel like I am cheating by having his support. I do help with the household bills, however, we hardly have any bills. We are debt free, cars and all. The financial support I get from my husband, however, is extremely minor compared to the support he gives me verbally, mentally, spiritually, and intellectually with college. He even gets into what I am studying and learns it himself. I'll be sitting at my desk studying one book, and he'll be accross from me studying another of my books. There have been times when I have freaked out, announced that I was going to get a full time job, and quit school, just because it's so hard to shed that mindset that you're useless if a man helps you. My husband has even tutored me in algebra. I don't like the mindset that all men want is their wives to be barefoot, pregnant, illiterate, and confined ot the house. My husband would have never married me if I Was like that. He is totally NOT the stereotypical abusive man. He's a great guy, and a great best friend. He makes it clear to me on a regular basis that he is not only proud of me, but that he wants to be like me, and that I don't have any obligation to him for money or sex, or anything like that. (We have sex, but you know what I mean). Today we were talking, and the subject came up of him going back to school when I am finished. It makes me soooooooooo relieved to think about switching "roles" with him in a few years. It would really help in making me feel less guilty about me being in school now. Have me be the main breadwinner and him the student. I am so excited about that, and can't wait. It will not only make things even, but my husband is a genius and *should* go to school. He's a mechanic now, but is thinking of majoring in either aerospace engineering or interior design. It's ultimately up to him, but I am rooting for the aerodynamics thing. There was a great thread about feminism on the stay at home or work debate. It was under "question of the week" and entitled, "Generational feminism". Reading it was very "kewl". For once, a discussion about feminism without nastiness, sarcasm, and complete intolerance of someone not agreeing. (Well, there was some, but for the most part, the thread made me feel a lot better about things). The women discussed differences between the older feminists (50's and 60's) being more about insisting women work, while the younger ones (25-40's) making feminism about having the choice of working or not. I never thought about the age of feminists being the difference in that whole metamorphasis. I always scratched my head as to why the old feminists in my life were so much the former, while the ones on the internet were so much the latter. Maybe their age is the reason. It makes a lot of sense. A lot of people insist that women "back then" didn't have choices to go out and work. I always wonder, who set it into place to NOT give them choices? Was it the law? Men? The previous generation? I feel like my mother when saying this, but "WHO'S *THEY*?" There's a popular saying that no one can make you inferior without your consent. I believe that these women did have choices all along, just didn't want to accept it. Or didn't know. Or just wanted to complain. Besides, all my great grandmothers worked. So they obviously had choices. By the way, I like the term "Texas transplant". Yes, and I am proud of it. Believe me, when I moved here, I didn't know that left wingers were going to hold ALL Texans responsible for GW. Please. I know that that's what was behind that comment. Might I remind you that we had a march for women's lives here. And not all of us like Bush. Remember the Dixie Chicks? Take care, and thanks for the reply. ~Danielle~ Y'all com back now, you hear? :D

      I have read a little bit of the debate, and it seems like most of the people answered against marriage. To be honest, that really hurts. The last time I checked, this life was about choices. People have the right to choose whatever path they feel is best for them, and for some, that means getting married. Even when there are some people out there that think "people" (in general) "shouldn't" get married. I am in my 20's and have a wonderful husband. He is the best friend I ever had. Yes I love him, why is that a bad thing? I chose to marry him, and that is my business and no one else's. If someone else wants to stay single, then that is their choice, but why would you take your bad experiences and blanket them onto everyone else and think that people shouldn't get married? Do you people expect those of us who are happily married to just go get a divorce and never see our spouses again just to please you? Correct me if I am wrong, but the last time I checked, I was responsible only to myself and not to some strangers on the internet. I personally cannot help it if other people chose to marry people that were bad for them. If people out there have had bad marriages, then I am sorry, really I am, but don't think that everyone out there must go through the same thing as you just to make you feel better. Don't tell others how to live their lives. I married my husband in my mid 20's, and no everything has not been perfect, we have had our ups and downs and our problems. But who doesn't? Marriage is hard, and so is living alone. Life is hard. Getting a JOB is hard. Working at a career or a job takes commitment, and the chances are you won't have that job forever, either. Does that mean people should stop working? Being in a family is hard, whether you are married or not. All relationships are hard, does that mean we should all cut ourselves off from everyone we love? I sure hope not. As many ups and downs as we have had, altogether, my life with my husband has been mostly great. I don't EVEN regret marrying him, and why should I? Just because someone else's husband beat her up? I am sorry for that, but my husband is not like that. I shouldn't have to live my life by other people's demands. I don't OWE certain women ANYTHING just because they had abusive spouses or "jerk" spouses. So sue me, I have a happy marriage. And I am most likely going to stay in that marriage. I hate the assumption that all women who choose to get married must be depending on the man to take care of them, and that they can't care for themselves. BS!!! I lived alone for over 7 years when I got married. I never got a dime from anyone except from the occasional birthday money from mom and dad. I got my degree while living on my own and even travelled to many different parts of the world either alone or with work. So don't tell me I don't know how to take care of myself!!! I also hate the assumption that women only get married for the wedding day and not the marriage. We got married at justice of the peace. I hated the idea of the wedding. That was such a bad generalization, I wanted to puke!! Also, why should I have not gotten married because we "might end up divorced someday"? You know what, I might get laid off from my job someday. Should I have never gotten this job? I might get killed in an accident. Should I never drive again? My mother might die, my friends might move away and never see me again, my dog might get run over, my coworkers might move on. Does that mean I should cut myself off from my mother, my friends, get rid of my dog, and not become friendly with people in the office? So then why should this "gambling" factor mean that I shouldn't have gotten married. BS again!!! Let me tell you- it looks totally unforseeable that we will ever get a divorce. But IF we do, and that is a big IFFFF, then I admit, I will cry for a while. I can't sit here and tell you that it won't hurt, it will. But ultimately, deep down, I will have been better off having been married to him than if I had never met him. That's how wonderful of a person he is. I will have been so thankful for X amount of years with such an awesome person who was my best friend through thick and thin, that it will eventually overshadow any sadness. I will have been an extremely lucky person for having KNOWN him, let alone being married to him. I have been through a lot of pain in my life, and have lost a lot of people and a lot of dreams, and things. But I don't regret having done any of it. To those of you who think "people shouldn't get married", then do everyone a favor and keep that opinion to yourselves, true of your own life. Let others live their lives as they seek fit, and do not overgeneralize. Some of us have made smart choices in who to marry. I apologise if others have not.

      I get my daily horoscope sent to my email every day.  Today it was so right on.  Here is a copy paste of it:  Remember that you don't always have to echo the opinions of those whom you admire. Someone will greatly respect you for speaking your own mind. Be careful when dealing with others, as a miscommunication is very possible. So long as you keep your eyes and ears wide open, you should be able to calm a storm before it gathers momentum. Others may seem aloof, but realize that it may just be that Cancer sensitivity coming to the forefront. Since family is important at this time, rather than letting your feelings be hurt, retreat instead with the ones you love. No one else really needs to know about your internal conflict. Put it behind you, and move forward.   I am attending college and majoring in social work.  I am majoring in social work, because my main goal for the past five years has been to help children.  Virtually all of the roll models I have have degrees in social work, and have started out working as a CPS caseworker.  That position makes me nervous and there is a lot of internal conflict.  I want to always, ALWAYS do the RIGHT thing when it comes to children.  I have worked closely with CPS workers in the past, and admire them, but I don't know if I am prepared for all the intensity, the criticism, and so on.  I have a while to finish school, tho, and in that time, I can work on asserting myself.
