      Have you ever been lying in bed, right on the verge of falling asleep, when you hear a noise that sounds exactly like what a homicidal knife-wielding maniac trying to sneak into your apartment probably sounds like, and then you get really scared and you can't sleep? Oh. Uh, me neither.

      So, I'm eating  urlLink yogurt  while surfing the Internet, admittedly paying less attention to the yogurt than to the Internet, when I look down to find globs of yogurt on  urlLink my desk  and the carpet, as well as dribbled down the front of  urlLink my sweatshirt . So much for hand-mouth coordination.

      Today, the guy behind the counter at Chili Pepper's said he'd like to take me to  urlLink Cancun . He said we could dance all night long, and drink and drink and drink. Presumably, he thought this would be enticing to me. However, it so happens that physical activity, alcoholic beverages and lecherous old men top my list of "Things I Try to Avoid At All Costs, Because They Make Me Want to Throw Up."

      It's funny how the rest of the America thinks Californians live in a perpetual state of  urlLink seismic activity , because it's totally not true, especially here. Pretty much everyone I talked to said that when they felt the shaking, they immediately assumed there was a logical explanation that had nothing to do with earthquakes. Like, when I noticed the counter I was leaning against was vibrating, I did not think "It's an earthquake!" I thought, "Is the washing machine on?" When I realized the washer was off, and the vibrations got stronger, I did not think "It's an earthquake!" I thought, "There must a really big truck driving by." When I looked outside and saw no truck, and my apartment really started shaking, I did not think, "It's an earthquake!" What I thought was, "Uh, is it an earthquake?" Like, had it not been for the stuff lying on the floor around me, I probably would have convinced myself it was just my downstairs neighbors  urlLink Jazzercising  violently, or some  urlLink cows  stampeding down the hill or something.  So, after my apartment stopped shaking, I tried to call people in hopes of confirming that a seismic event had, in fact, occurred and I wasn't completely insane. But I couldn't call anyone. And no one could call me. My  urlLink cell phone  was pretty much useless. Which seems odd, because isn't that a basic premise of the technology, to be a convenient and reliable form of communication in case of an emergency? So, now I know that, should disaster strike, my phone is not to be counted on for anything more than providing me with the option of listening to the ringtone version of  urlLink "Rock Your Body"  as I die a slow, painful death.  Then I went to work, where, in honor of the earthquake, we ate  urlLink pizza . Ah, to be callous, cynical and unaffected by tragedy.

      Apparently, my grandma is still getting used to the idea that I'm living on my own. I sent her a Christmas card, and she excitedly called my mom to tell her about it.  Grandma: "I got a card from Chrissy!" Mom: "Oh, you did?" Grandma: "From her house!"  She then proceeded to read aloud my address as written on the envelope.  I guess the older you get, the lower your "cause for excitement" bar is set.

      It seems  urlLink people are freaking out  because online directories often include a link to an online maps site, so that anyone who looks up your name and phone number on the Internet can get a map to your house. So everyone's all worried about privacy and personal safety and whether a murderer is going to ring their doorbell tomorrow because he looked them up on  urlLink MapQuest . Listen, if somebody REALLY wanted to kill you, do you honestly think getting  urlLink Google  to take your name off their list is going to save you? Like a murderer is going to say, "Huh ... I can't find my intended victim on  urlLink WhitePages.com . Oh well, looks like I can go to that  urlLink knitting workshop  tonight after all." No! He's going to keep looking! In fact, he might even resort to a phone book or a  urlLink Thomas guide  or some other non-digital form of public record from which online directories cull their information in the first place. Freaking technophobic crybabies.

      So, I was reading this  urlLink story about companies being stingy with year-end bonuses , and it talks about this one company whose employees are all butt-hurt because they are only getting $10,000 this year. ONLY TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. Could you imagine? "Oh, do you like my  urlLink brand-new super-expensive car ? I just bought it today with my fucking enormous Christmas bonus." I got like $90 from my employer last year, and I was like "Woo hoo! $90!" Seriously. I think $10,000 would send me into cardiac arrest. However, if the kind folks at  urlLink Lincoln Electric Holdings  would like to send one of those pathetically measly bonuses my way, I'll take that chance.

      It's a little bothersome to me that  urlLink McDonald's  is promoting its "NEW"  urlLink Chicken McNuggets , "Now with all white meat!" As if to say, "Before, God knows what we put in those things, so we really can't blame you for not eating them. But now, rest assured, it's all white meat! So dig in!" And I can't be sure of this, but I'd bet the core demographic of McNugget-eaters consists of children under age 12. Meaning, from the day the idea of Chicken McNuggets was hatched in like 1983, up until about a month ago, the people at McDonald's were totally fine with the fact they were feeding our nation's fragile, still-developing youngsters deep-fried chicken byproducts. Good thing it hasn't adversely affected America's  urlLink fat ,  urlLink diabetes-ridden ,  urlLink heart-diseased ,  urlLink lazy  youth ...

      I went to the  urlLink Gap  today to exchange some gloves my sister got me for my birthday (they were large; I am small). While browsing the selection of festive winter accessories, I noticed the store carried an abundance of mittens, which made me think: What the hell for? I mean, I understand the whole thwarting frostbite thing, but gloves are just as good for that, with an added benefit: While wearing gloves, you can still use your fingers. If you're wearing mittens, and a situation arises in which the ability to separate your fingers more than a quarter-inch from each other is crucial, you're out of luck, buddy. Say, for instance, you are at work, and your boss walks up to your cubicle and is like "I want that annual report on my desk ASAP!" and stands there glaring at you. You don't want to get fired, so you frantically start typing, except your fingers are bound by mittens, so all your boss sees while he stands over your shoulder is this:   asd;lfasdflkjasdfj;adsfj;dfaj;ksafierwqioadfsjk;dsfajk  (this is where your mittened hands accidently hit caps lock) AFDJSKADSF;JADFS;REQUIERQIWU[REQUIWFADJS;CVNFAJDKL;ADFJS;  And now your dumb mittened ass is  urlLink unemployed . Good job, mittens for hands.

      So, I was standing at  urlLink Subway 's drink station, filling my 22-ounce cup with  urlLink Cherry Pepsi , when I noticed a teenage boy watching me from about two feet away. I ignored him.  "That sandwich looks good," the boy said.  "That sandwich" was wrapped in Subway paper, in a plastic bag.

      I just went to check on Frog before I went to bed, and she has snail eggs all over her. She must have sat on them by accident. You would think she'd notice a bunch of snail eggs stuck to her. I certainly would notice if I had snail eggs stuck to me. Except maybe if they were in my hair. Or stuck to the seat of my pants. But Frog doesn't have hair OR pants, so there's really no excuse.

      Oftentimes when the U.S. government decides to  urlLink recall  a particular food product, it's because said product contains "undeclared ingredients" that could cause certain people to break out in hives or throw up or die or something. Usually the "undeclared ingredients" are things like nuts or wheat, so you don't ever hear about the recall, because nuts and wheat are boring. It's only when something generally considered to be inedible  ends up in food that you hear about it. Por ejemplo:  WASHINGTON (AP) —  urlLink Hormel Foods  is recalling about 104,000 pounds of  urlLink Stagg canned chili  from stores in 16 states because it may contain plastic and other material, the  urlLink Agriculture Department  said Wednesday. Department officials said the pieces of plastic came from a calculator. No injuries have been reported. Hormel, which owns Stagg Foods and is based in Austin, Minn., issued the recall after receiving complaints from consumers.  Now, I've never actually made chili from scratch, and because of that I'm far from an expert on this topic, but even so, I would imagine that a calculator is not an integral part of the chili-cooking process. Beef, yes. Beans, yes. Modified food starch, yes. Calculators, not so much.  Being a  urlLink copy editor  whose job it is to scrutinize stories for what we in the journalism industry call — please excuse the complicated terminology here —  "holes," I am able to see that the reporter left out some vital information, such as: How in the hell does a  urlLink calculator  end up in a pot of chili? This "hole" leaves you, the reader, to imagine scenarios in which this could plausibly occur. However, to save you some time, I've gone ahead and imagined the plausible scenarios for you.   Plausible scenario No. 1:  A spy from rival  urlLink Dennison's  snuck into the chili kitchen and, being a corporate type, was unable to come up with a more imaginative  urlLink sabotage  scheme than yelling "Is that  urlLink Andy Dick ?" and tossing his calculator in the chili vat while everyone's heads were turned.   Plausible scenario No. 2:  The overworked and underpaid cooks decided to torment the socially awkward company accountant by taunting him with mean-spirited nicknames such as "Pencil Neck," "Four Eyes" and " urlLink Tucker Carlson " while dangling him upside-down over a vat of steaming chili, thus enabling his calculator to slip from his pocket protector into the  urlLink pool of mushy goo .   Plausible scenario No. 3:  In a case of quality control gone awry, a bean counter, whose job it was to actually count the beans, was walking toward the chili vat with his trusty bean-counting calculator in hand when he  urlLink slipped on a banana peel , sending his calculator flying through the air, narrowly missing the head of Bob the Chief Executive of  urlLink Tomato Paste , and finally coming to rest in the vat of chili.  So, I think those are probably the most likely ways that calculator ended up in the chili. Am I right or am I right?   P.S.  While I was looking for a calculator link, I came across  urlLink The Love Calculator , which claims Jimmy Fallon and I are only 26 percent compatible. Luckily, I'm smart enough to know that you can't believe everything you read on the Internet.

      So, I just watched the latest episode of  urlLink "The Real World San Diego"  and, I have to say, that guy who called the police on Robin is the biggest pussy in the world. I mean, okay, she socked him, but he was clearly asking for it. Any dumbass can tell you that you can't yell insults at someone, especially an inebriated someone, and not expect some kind of retribution. And how hurt could he have been, having just been punched on the arm by a drunk chick? He didn't fall to the ground in agony. He wasn't even bleeding. He just stood there and yelled at her some more. So, you gotta wonder what he was thinking when he called the police. "Dude, no way some 'Real World' chick is gonna sock me on the arm on national television and get away with it. I'll show her! I'm going to call the police and file battery charges against her, even though I'm not really hurt at all and I probably deserve even more of a beating because I'm clearly a sissy bitch." And when Robin was getting arrested, you could see the guy standing there with the cops, looking smug as hell. Yeah buddy, you look real cool standing there watching her get cuffed over a scratch on your arm. Moron.  And the worst part of the whole thing is, I'm sitting here writing this blog entry in support of Robin, when I  actually think she's the biggest idiot in that house. See, sissy guy with the scratched arm, you are SO LAME that you're forcing me to take her side. Way to go.

      I'm a big fan of  urlLink Crest Whitestrips . So I was pretty excited to see they now have  premium  Whitestrips, because I'm impatient, and if my teeth can reach a level of whiteness previously known only to  urlLink Hollywood celebrities  and  urlLink fluorescent lighting  in seven days rather than 14, sign me up.   But I can't help but wonder if Crest is up to something. I mean, a few years ago, when Whitestrips debuted, Crest was like "Hey everybody, we can make your teeth super white in just 14 days!" So everybody went out and bought Whitestrips like crazy, so excited about the prospect of blindingly white teeth in but a fortnight. But now, the clamor for Whitestrips has died down, so Crest unveils the premium Whitestrips, promising whiter teeth in half the time it took before. So what happens when sales of these Whitestrips dwindle? Will we then see whiter smiles in 3.5 days? For all we know, the people at Crest are sitting on a secret Ultra X-treme Whitestrips to the Max version that would make our teeth whiter in like 35 seconds, but they know we're stupid and will settle for a week or two, so they're dragging the process out and cashing in. Jerks.

      In a day and age where you can customize everything from  urlLink your makeup  to  urlLink your Nikes , it should come as no surprise that people are now  urlLink customizing their dogs . Apparently, the especially trendy pets are  urlLink poodle  mixes, which begs the question: Why? Why would you ruin a perfectly good dog by introducing poodleness into its bloodline? Poodles are quite possibly the ugliest dogs in the world. And they most definitely have the worst hairdos, except for maybe  urlLink this guy . And they're completely useless. I mean, how many times has a poodle scared a  urlLink burglar  out of your house?  urlLink Alerted the authorities after you fell down a well ?  urlLink Brought you a barrel of water when you were stranded in the Swiss Alps ?  urlLink Helped you and your vanful of groovy friends solve a mystery ? I'd venture to guess NEVER. Because poodles are good for nothing, except mocking. Plus, they're French. So they probably have mad B.O.

       1:24 p.m.:  Upon arrival at work, notice  urlLink Krispy Kreme  doughnut box perched on desk. Peer inside and see six delicious-looking glazed doughnuts. Suddenly become consumed with desire.   1:25 p.m.:  Decide to put work first and endeavor to resist temptation.   1:26 p.m.:  Sneak peek at box of doughnuts. Make sure to look away quickly so that doughnuts do not notice.   1:27 p.m.:  Sweet smell of doughnut glaze wafts from box. Doughnuts are teasing me.    1:28-2:59 p.m.:  Furtive glances at doughnuts turn into prolonged eye contact. Hunger for doughnuts grows.   3 p.m.:  Go to afternoon news meeting and stare longingly out window at doughnut box in cubicle.   3:15 p.m.:  Sit back down at desk and attempt to ignore doughnuts.   3:16 p.m.:  Cannot resist doughnuts any longer. Promise myself I will eat only one.   3:17 p.m.:  Gingerly open box and inhale deeply. Feel weak. Take two.   3:18 p.m.:  Carefully wrap doughnuts in napkin and steal away to lunch room for some privacy.    3:19 p.m.:  Heat up doughnuts in microwave for 15 seconds. Eat them really fast.   3:20 p.m.:  Return to cubicle with every intention of saving rest of doughnuts for later.   3:25 p.m.:  Cannot get doughnuts out of head. Offer doughnut to colleague in cubicle next door. Breathe sigh of relief when he politely declines.   4:17 p.m.:  Delicious doughnut smell is distracting. Push doughnut box farther away from me.   4:19 p.m.:  Miss doughnut smell. Pull doughnut box closer.   5:15 p.m.:  Colleague calls me from home to inquire about status of doughnuts. Assure him all is well.   7:49 p.m.:  Accidentally type "campaign doughnuts" instead of "campaign donations" in a headline.   8:24 p.m.:  Stop working to daydream about our future together. Picture myself, illuminated by the morning sun, savoring a delicious-if-not-healthful breakfast of doughnuts and orange juice. Fill with inexplicable joy.   10:30 p.m.:  Finish work. Embrace box of doughnuts and walk out to car.   10:34 p.m.:  Arrive home, set doughnut box on counter, wrestle with temptation.   10:35 p.m.:  Eat doughnut.   10:36 p.m.:  Eat doughnut.   10:37 p.m.:  Call sister to offer her last remaining doughnuts. Leave her the following voicemail message: "Hi! Um, I was calling to offer you a Krispy Kreme doughnut, but by the time you get this, I will probably have eaten them all. Sorry."   10:38 p.m.:  Eat last two doughnuts.   10:41 p.m.:  Get tummyache. Swear off Krispy Kreme doughnuts for good. Or until another box comes along ...

      I've never really been interested in that whole "religion" thing, or paid much attention to that  urlLink "Jesus"  guy. But  urlLink this sounds like a pretty good deal  to me.   I'm not really into  urlLink Tony Hawk  though. I wonder if the Lord would kick down some omnipotence for my  urlLink Sim  instead. Like maybe let my Sim walk on water, so I don't have to spend all those simoleons on ladders for her swimming pool. Or maybe give my Sim the power to pull loaves and fishes out of her ass when her hunger meter is low. Well, not literally out of her ass. Wait! Yes! Out of her ass! That would rule.

Okay, now imagine that tiny little insect in your car is actually a  urlLink GIGANTIC CARNIVOROUS BIRD OF PREY :  TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (AP) - A vulture flew into a tractor trailer's cab Sunday along a rural highway in southernmost  urlLink Chiapas state , triggering a crash that killed one person and injured two, authorities said. The buzzard was pecking at a dead animal alongside a highway outside the community of Angel Albino Corzo when a truck hauling construction equipment roared past, frightening the bird, according to the Chiapas state attorney general's office. The spooked vulture bee-lined its way through an open window and into the truck's cab, causing the driver to lose control of the vehicle and careen off the highway and into a shallow ravine nearby. The driver was killed instantly. Two people who were riding with him were injured. And you were all worried over a  urlLink bee .

      I was impatiently switching radio stations while driving down the street today when I came across  urlLink "Hey Ya"  — on the  urlLink adult comtemporary station .   What's next,  urlLink Jay-Z  on  urlLink VH1 ?  urlLink Oh wait ...

      So, for the last few weeks, I've been getting an unusual number of "unknown calls" on my cell phone. You know, the ones from people who, in the interest of maintaining their privacy, or perhaps out of un urlLink justified  paranoia, feel the need to block Caller ID. So, I never answer the unknown calls, because what if it's someone stupid? Someone stupid who blocks his number because he knows that I would not answer the phone if I knew it was him calling because I think he is stupid? I don't want to talk to someone stupid.  Also, the unknown caller never leaves voicemail messages. Presumably because he's stupid.   Anyways, late last week, Robin, who is not stupid, suggested that I answer my phone the next time I get an unknown call so I can find out who it is. So today, at 5:06 p.m., my phone started ringing, but by the time I realized it, Mr. Unknown Caller had already hung up. Fortunately, he called back at 7:59 p.m. and I answered. Our conversation follows:   Me:  "Hello?"  Unknown Caller:   (about three or four seconds of silence)  ..."Hello."  Click.   What?? After two weeks of being harrassed by near daily calls, all I get is "Hello"? No polite chit chat, no heavy breathing, just "Hello"? Is that really all he had to say? I mean, I would think that, after sitting there listening to my phone ring for weeks, the guy had plenty of time to prepare something a little more substantial for the day he finally got through to me. Like maybe, "You're right, I  am  stupid."

      So, did I mention how I ordered  urlLink a horseshoe set  (a Christmas gift for my dad, not for a  urlLink horse ) from  urlLink Red Envelope ? And how they sent me two of them by mistake? And how I kept both of them? Even though I only paid for one? And did I mention how the company reported Friday that  urlLink it failed to meet its earnings expectations over the holidays because of problems with distribution and shipping , an announcement that sent its stock prices plummeting 28 percent? I feel so guilty.

      I was having lunch with my mom today when an old friend of hers from high school came over to our table to say hello. So they're like "Blah blah, niceties and chit chat" when the old friend says to my mom, "Is this your daughter?" Referring to me. And my mom's like, "Yeah, she's my oldest." Then the old friend turns to me and is like, "Oh, do you go to Nipomo?" Meaning,  urlLink Nipomo High School . Meaning, she thought I was 15. Meaning, I suddenly became very annoyed. I wonder if this is how  urlLink Webster  feels ...

      Have you ever played  urlLink The Sims ? If not, DON'T. Seriously. It's addictive. It's the heroin of computer games. You sit down to play it, just for a few minutes, because you seem to remember the last time you played your Sim had to go to the bathroom, and it's been a few days, and you're not a cruel person, so you turn on the game so your Sim can pee, and then you notice that your Sim is also hungry, so you have her eat lunch, and then she just puts her empty plate on the floor, and you don't see the maid around, so you tell her to clean it up, and then you notice she's bored, so you make her watch TV for awhile, but wait, the newspaper is here, she better read that in case there's a better job in there, but now she's bored again because you made her too playful and she hates to read, so you let her watch TV again, but now she's lonely and keeps crying, so you have her call the Sim boyfriend you made for her, and he comes over, and you have to make them talk to each other because you want them to get married but they're still acquaintances, so they keep talking and talking and talking, and you're impatient so you make her kiss him, but it's too soon so he's pissed, and now they don't want to talk, and she's bored again, so you make her go study cooking so she doesn't start a fire in the kitchen again, but she's too depressed to study, so you make her take a bath in that $3,000 super fancy bathtub you bought after you figured out the  urlLink cheat code to get more money , and then you look around and realize you've been sitting at your computer for 17 hours straight.   That's 17 hours you could have spent  urlLink blogging !

      Today I was approaching the Madonna/Higuera intersection when I noticed a homeless guy standing on the sidewalk holding a cardboard sign. I meant to ignore him, because I've found that eye contact encourages begging, and if he were to say something to me then I'd have to pretend not to have noticed him, because that's easier than telling him to get a job, which is what I want to say whenever a homeless person asks me for change because I'm a cruel and heartless person. But he would see right through my quickly averted gaze and know I really did see him but are callously making like I didn't, and then he'd think I'm a terribly rude person, which I am, but that's beside the point. However, if I ignore him from the get-go, then he might think that I'm actually a kind-hearted, generous soul who probably would have given him a couple of bucks, a hamburger, and maybe even a ride into town had I not been so focused on the road ahead of me. It's all about perception.  So like I was saying, I meant to ignore the guy, but I couldn't help but notice that his sign did not say "Will work for food." In fact, it didn't say  urlLink anything that cardboard signs held by homeless guys usually say . What it said was, "Come on, smile!"   Of course, I'm the kind of person who, when told to do something, will make every effort to NOT do it, just to be difficult. So I prepared myself to frown convincingly as I drove by. But then something funny happened.   The homeless guy started dancing.   It was just a little bootie-shaking. Not like he broke into  urlLink the Roger Rabbit  or anything. But it was funny. I mean, how often do you see a homeless guy dancing?   I had to smile.  And as I drove past the dancing homeless guy, something inside me changed. I thought about how long he must have been standing on that corner, under the hot afternoon sun, making a fool of himself in order to brighten the day of a perfect stranger. And I wondered if any of the hundreds of people driving by that afternoon had chosen to return the favor and brighten his day a bit. And I knew what I had to do ...  I drove home and blogged about it!   (What, did you think I was going to go give the dancing homeless guy some money or something? Didn't you read the part where I said I'm cruel and heartless? Sucker.)

      So did you hear about  urlLink Michael Jackson going incognito at Wal-Mart ?  What's up with that? I mean, sure,  urlLink Wal-Mart  isn't  urlLink the coolest place to be seen . But is the potential for embarrassment so great that it's necessary to cover your entire face with a  urlLink ski mask ?

      I can't stop thinking about puppies.  Maybe it's because I hardly ever see Jake and Brandi anymore. Or because an increasing number of people I know are getting dogs. Or maybe I've been watching entirely too much  urlLink Animal Precinct .  Whatever the reason, I've got puppies on the brain.  So I bought this  urlLink really cool book  that has all kinds of pictures of all kinds of dogs, and it's sitting on my  urlLink coffee table , so I can't help but look at it whenever I'm sitting on the floor where a couch should be but won't until Thursday. And everytime I look at it, I think about how much fun it would be to have a loveable, huggable puppy there next to me, chewing on the table and peeing all over the carpet. (I added that last part in an effort to temper my longing. It didn't work. Longing continues.)   I'm not exactly sure what kind of puppy I want, though. Besides Jake, I mean. Because, as you know,  urlLink my favorite kind of dog is Jake.  It's too bad he's old and poops everywhere, because I would totally let him live with me. We have a lot in common — we both like to eat french fries, we both fall down a lot, and he sleeps almost as much as I do. We're a perfect match.  Unfortunately, as I said before, he poops a lot, so he's staying with Mom and Dad.  So I was thinking that I'd really like an  urlLink English bulldog . You know, like  urlLink Lola Osbourne . I actually had a bulldog when I was little: Buster the  urlLink Pound Puppy . He was gray and flame-retardant and, unlike Jake, he hardly pooped at all.  Anyway, out of curiosity, I did a quick search on  urlLink Yahoo! classifieds  for  urlLink English bulldogs , just to see how much the little guys go for. I expected them to be kind of expensive, but I was wrong — they were EXTREMELY expensive. RIDICULOUSLY expensive.  LUDACRIS LY expensive.   Just how expensive are these dogs? Let me break it down for you ...   For the price of one English bulldog puppy (I'm using the least expensive price in the classifieds here), you could buy:  • 22  urlLink Lacoste polo shirts   • 10  urlLink llamas   • 159  urlLink autographed headshots of your favorite Real World/Road Rules cast member   • Six-tenths of an  urlLink Audi A4  (base model)  • 1,500  urlLink Whoppers  at 99 cents each plus 7.25% CA sales tax  •  urlLink My couch    Now, maybe I'm just being cheap here, but ... $1,590? For a dog? How can anyone get away with charging that much? It's not like dogs are hard to come by. I mean, people are always giving away dogs — at the pound, in the EZ Ad, in front of the grocery store — for FREE.   I could maybe understand paying that much if the dog already was trained to do really cool tricks, like juggle, or wash the dishes or do my taxes or something. But I bet the dog isn't trained at all. In fact, I bet that $1,590 dog is so completely untrained that he'd poop all over the house, and then try to eat it. And then barf on  urlLink my shoes .  Maybe I'll just steal Jake after all.

I'm pretty open to suggestion here, but I would be partial to destinations in close proximity to  urlLink shopping malls ,  urlLink Ikeas ,  urlLink zoos ,  urlLink Krispy Kreme doughnuts ,  urlLink puppies  or  urlLink Jimmy Fallon .  Think it over and get back to me,  urlLink America .

      Have you ever asked a spoon to do a knife's job?   I have, and let me tell you, the spoon just does not cut it.  It all started around 2 a.m. last night, when I suddenly became very hungry. Because I don't know how to cook and I rarely buy anything at the grocery store besides  urlLink Rice Krispies Treats  and  urlLink juice boxes , it was slim pickins. So, after much deliberation, I decided to prepare a quick snack of  urlLink peanut butter  on  urlLink toast .  The toasting part was easy enough (I'm a quick study in the kitchen) but I ran into problems with the application of the peanut butter. You see, due to circumstances not at all beyond my control, every one of my knives, with which I had planned to spread the peanut butter, was in the sink, dirty. (As opposed to  dirrty , which would involve the knives wearing leather chaps and humping half-naked men.)  So, there I stood in the kitchen, with my toast quickly cooling and no clean knives in sight. I knew I had to act fast, so I pulled open the drawer in which my utensils reside and grabbed a spoon.   It was a fatal mistake.  Okay, maybe that was overstating things a little. It wasn't a  fatal  mistake. But the spoon didn't work as well as I thought it would. I mean, it certainly allowed me to have a larger amount of peanut butter at my disposal than a knife would have. But all the peanut butter in the world will do you no good if you can't get it off the spoon and onto the toast.   Which leads me to the moral of this story: You should always just eat the Rice Krispies Treats.

      So, did you hear about the 9-year-old girl who plans to  urlLink stick a balloon up her nose, hold it with her toes, and inflate it  on  urlLink Letterman  tonight?  "She's very, very intelligent," her proud stepmom told  urlLink The Associated Press . Now, maybe it's just me, but if I were to see someone sticking random objects up into his or her nasal cavity, "intelligent" is probably not the first adjective that would come to mind. It would probably be something more along the lines of "mentally retarded."  It appears this girl isn't only motivated by retardedness, however; she's also driven by the prospect of fame — the article mentions that she "dreams of becoming a pop star." Clearly this is not as far-fetched a dream as it was once was, since pretty much anyone can get a record deal these days; I think it's the free gift when you buy a  urlLink Ronco rotisserie  off QVC.   So what I don't understand is, why isn't someone pulling this girl aside and talking some sense into her? I mean, if you are an aspiring pop star, is this really how you want to introduce yourself to the world — with a balloon up your nose? What kind of first impression is that? And you know that shit's going to be all over the place if she ever makes it big. Can't you already see the  urlLink Access Hollywood  exposé?  And what if this girl  doesn't  go on to become a mega-superstar teenybopper? What if blowing up a balloon with her nose in front of a live studio audience on late-night television is the highlight of her career? What if she's forced to live the rest of her life in relative obscurity? Like normal people who don't shove balloons up their noses?   God help her.

      The secret's out:  urlLink I am a dumbass .  I must admit, however, that he's right. I am a dumbass. Maybe I should put that in the title of my blog, as a warning to lonely, judgmental blog surfers that they should read no further, lest they be overcome with inexplicable irritation over a complete stranger's lack of interest in our nation's politics.  Now, I sense a bit of hostility in his comment. I wonder what he's so upset about. He can't possibly be mad at me, someone whom he has never met and knows nothing about. Because that would be silly. There must be some other reason. Did he have a bad day at school? Is he upset that he has nothing better to do on a Friday night than sit in front of his computer insulting strangers via blog comments? Perhaps he's just jealous that I'm funny, while he's merely "smoove." In any event, I'm sure his anger is misdirected.  I am also concerned that he is lobbing insults at people without first knowing the facts. He really can't say for sure that I'm a dumbass, based on a sole blog entry. Yet he made no effort to confirm his suspicions through further investigation. He didn't even consider that there could be special circumstances surrounding my lack of voter registration ... ness ... that would shed light upon the whole affair.  For example, maybe I'm only 12 years old. Does being a minor and therefore ineligible for voter registration make me a dumbass? I don't think so.  Or maybe I'm  urlLink a Cuban national who sailed to the Florida coast in a 1959 Buick , and because of my status as an illegal immigrant, I am not allowed to participate in the voting process. Now, does that make me a dumbass? Clearly, the answer is no.  Or maybe I'm blogging from my cell at  urlLink San Quentin , fervently wishing I had never killed that man so I could join my fellow Americans in casting a vote on Election Day. Would you call me a dumbass for that? You better not.  Or maybe, just maybe, I  am  registered to vote, as I have been since I turned 18, but I moved to a new city and haven't gotten around to filling out a  urlLink change of address form  yet, the same way I haven't gotten around to hanging anything on my walls or unpacking my CDs. I don't even have a  urlLink couch  yet for crying out loud. And maybe I threw that last line in there for comedic effect — because I knew my friends, the people who actually have a reason to read this blog, would shake their heads and, with a chuckle, say, "That Chrissy."   Only under their breath would they mutter, "Dumbass."

      I bet a copy editor got blamed for this:  VANCOUVER, Wash. (AP) —  Barbara Bennett wanted to sell her  urlLink Brother brand sewing machine , so she bought a classified advertisement under "Miscellaneous" and "Items under $50" in  urlLink The Columbian  newspaper.   Instead, the words "sewing machine" were accidentally dropped, leaving a "BROTHER" for sale ad.   One caller wanted to know if the price was negotiable. Another, upon hearing what was really for sale, said merely, "Thank you," and hung up.  Now, I would argue that the best part of this story is not the typographical error (I've  made  seen funnier ones), but rather that people actually called in because they were interested in purchasing someone's brother.  Which got me to thinking: I wonder how much Tommy would go for.   Granted, he's not in very good condition, what with that "Now that I've dropped out of school and abandoned the picket lines, I have all the time in the world to eat" potbelly of his, not to mention his tar-blackened lungs and the fact that he's allergic to pretty much everything.   And, he's not very useful. In fact, he's pretty much good for nothing. Unless you're in the market for someone to eat all your food, steal your money, sell your CDs and crash your car. In which case, Tommy's your man.  Of course, he smells pretty bad, so that's something to consider. Plus, he refuses to get a haircut, so he looks kinda like a  urlLink gorilla . And if it's a gorilla you're looking for, you might as well go all out and get the real thing. I'm pretty sure that's not against the law or anything. (Just make sure that, if you live in Massachusetts,  urlLink you let your gorilla ride shotgun .)  I know none of that sounds especially tempting, but as everyone who's ever worked at a  urlLink fast-food restaurant's drive-thru window  knows, it's not what you're selling but how you sell it. The item in question doesn't have to be a good buy; it just has to  sound  like a good buy.  So clearly what I would need is a catchy jingle. Something like, "Double your pleasure, double your fun, with Tommy (I don't mean the gun)."   Yeah, that's lame. How about just a slogan:    urlLink A little brother'll do ya.    urlLink A brother is forever.   urlLink A brother is a terrible thing to waste.   urlLink Like a good brother, Tommy is there (or he will be, once you buy him and take him home).   urlLink Tommy. Don't leave home without him.   urlLink Tommy makes hamburgers taste like steakburgers.   You know, something along those lines.  Maybe I should just rip off  urlLink the Olsen twins . I'm pretty sure my sister and I ad-libbed our own version of that song once before, although I don't remember how it went. It probably mentioned that Tommy stinks though.

      For the record, I think politics is boring ... are boring ... whatever.  So I generally try to ignore political stuff, which is hard, considering I work at a newspaper. But so far, I have managed. Until today.  You see, a lot of people have been asking me which candidate I am endorsing for the 2004 presidential election.* My initial plan was to wait until the unbearable humiliation of repeated primary losses manifested itself and narrowed down the unwieldy field of Democratic hopefuls to, say, one.  urlLink This has been going pretty well.  However, as I believe I have mentioned before, I am  urlLink impatient . I've been becoming ever more unsure that I could wait for 36 more states to hold primary elections. I mean, these people are voting  urlLink until June ! If I wanted to wait that long, I might as well do a bunch of research and think really hard and decide for myself. And wouldn't that be a waste of time.   urlLink So thank god for the Internet.  Now I know that, come Election Day, I can check the box right next to the name of my man  urlLink John Kerry  in complete confidence.  That is, if I ever register to vote.   * This is a lie. No one ever asks me that.

      Every day, as I'm driving to work, I pass a  urlLink Yellow  freight truck parked along the side of the road, and every day, as I cruise by, I look out my car window at its boldly stated logo, and I think: "LIARS!"  You know the trucks I'm talking about, right? Those big ones that, despite the large letters announcing "YELLOW" all over the place, cannot disguise the fact that  urlLink they are actually orange . In fact, there is not a single part of those trucks that could qualify as "yellow." It's an outright falsehood made ridiculous by its audacity. I mean, who do they think they're kidding? Clearly, the truck is not yellow. Even a 5-year-old could tell you that. Telling people that your truck is yellow does not make it yellow. It's like, those girls who are really ugly and also fat but wear shirts that say "Hottie." (Note to aforementioned girls: We don't believe you.)  So what's the deal with Yellow Transportation Inc.? Are they being  urlLink ironic ? Was the guy they hired to paint their trucks  urlLink colorblind ? Is it that their CEO has beef with  urlLink Binney & Smith  so he's hatched a sinister plot to trick the people of America into thinking that since Yellow is orange, orange is yellow, thereby throwing the crayon industry into utter turmoil? Because that would be cool.  Unfortunately, the official answer isn't so exciting. It's something to do about  urlLink safety , being able to see the trucks from far away so you don't get run over and die, stuff like that. So basically, their justification for lying has to do with a remote threat to public safety. Who runs this company,  urlLink the Bush administration ?

      I'm pleased to report that I've finally received one of  urlLink those emails from that crazy Nigerian guy  who needs your help transferring a crapload of money into an overseas bank account and promises to kick down a significant portion of that money to you in return. You know, that scam that has everyone from  urlLink hapless eBay users  to  urlLink Brazilian banks  forking over ridiculous amounts of money to people they've never met in countries they've never been to in hopes that after it's all over they'll finally be able to swim around in a mountain of gold coins like  urlLink Scrooge McDuck . And not only do these morons empty their bank accounts for this guy, they actually go to Nigeria — despite the  urlLink U.S. Department of State's warning  that this is a very bad place — in order to collect their promised-but-sadly-nonexistent fortune. Once they get there, of course, they quickly find themselves both broke AND dead, because this is a Third World country roiled in violence that we're talking about here.   Even so, I'd heard so much about this scam that I felt kinda left out because Dr. Arliru Ayodele, the purported chairman of contract advisory board of the Nigeria Department of Petroleum Resources, hadn't yet bothered to ask for my help. I mean, what am I,  urlLink chopped liver ?  That's not to say I'm going to help him, of course. I'm no  urlLink sucker .  You know what just occurred to me?  urlLink Nigeria  has the Internet. Weird.

      I'm still liking the orange, but I brought back the green for old times' sake.  My Dreamweaver trial period expires in nine days, so unless I find a crack for it, or $399, this'll be the last big shake-up for a while.

       Question:  What do the Sunday edition of  urlLink The Tribune  and  urlLink a prescription medication for genital herpes  have in common?   Hint:  It's not me.   Answer:  The slogan, "It's a brand new day!"   Which obviously means the people at  urlLink GlaxoSmithKline  are sneaky, slogan-stealing rat bastards! And the people at The Tribune are huge  urlLink No Doubt  fans.

      For a while now, I've been thinking about how to spend my life savings. At first I thought I'd buy a house, but then I remembered that  urlLink I live in one of the nation's least affordable housing markets , which means I'd have to buy, like, a  urlLink vanagon  and live down by the river. But then I'd be a hippie.  urlLink And hippies suck .  So then I thought, well, maybe I should buy a  urlLink really cool car . But then I remembered I already have a  urlLink really cool car . Okay, a kinda cool car. A not-so-much-cool-as-still-operative car? Whatever.  Anyway, I still hadn't decided on what to spend my money when I came across the news that  urlLink Grand Royal is for sale.  Perfect! I'll buy a record label and then sign a whole bunch of bands and make all kinds of money! And then I can spend my days lounging in  urlLink Saint Tropez  wearing Gucci loafers and drinking Cristal with Jay-Z and P. Diddy and Jermaine Dupri and all those other blinged-out, record-label-owning rappers. And maybe Jimmy Fallon would be there, too! How cool would that be?  Unfortunately, after I did  urlLink a little research , I found that the Grand Royal spoils consist mostly of cassette tapes from  urlLink bands no one's ever heard of  and  urlLink Luscious Jackson  tank tops.   I don't think that's going to get me to France.

      Today's  urlLink Groundhog Day ! Which means that, as I write this, thousands of people are holding their collective breath in anticipation of the moment when Punxsutawney Phil pops his furry little head out of his burrow and lets them know once and for all just how much longer they have to wear those  urlLink stupid earmuffs .  I know what you're thinking: " Thousands  of people? Surely, you are exaggerating."   I understand why you would think that, as I have been known,  urlLink on occasion , to stretch the truth a bit. However, my good friends at  urlLink The Associated Press  would never lie to you. Never!  So, you see, there really are thousands of people standing in the snow, possibly in the early stages of frostbite, eagerly awaiting Phil's prediction.   I know what you're thinking: " Eager ? Come on. It's not like they're out there chanting the groundhog's name. Is it?"  I'm afraid  urlLink it is .  I know what you're thinking: "What kind of  urlLink moron  gets up at the crack of dawn to sit in the freezing cold and wait hours for a rodent to be prodded out of its hole so it can look around and not understand what the hell is going on because it’s a GROUNDHOG for god’s sake."  That's a fine question. Why don't you  urlLink ask the furry one himself ?

      Don't worry, I'm not going to bore you with my thoughts about  urlLink "the greatest super bowl ever."  This is mainly because I sat with my back to the TV screen for most of the game, turning around only during the commercials, and even then only if someone else was laughing at them, so I really couldn't tell you anything about the actual sporting event, including who won, or even who played, for that matter.   Football, schmootball.  I did, however, happen to catch the  urlLink "lamest super bowl halftime show ever."  Seriously. Who picked these performers? Was it that every pop star who had a hit in 2003 was booked, so they had to resort to pop stars who had a hit sometime within the last 15 years? I mean,  urlLink Kid Rock ? Who listens to Kid Rock anymore? Even Pamela Anderson-I-Mean-Lee has had enough of that guy. And don't get me wrong, I love  urlLink Nelly , but  urlLink "Hot in Herre"  is so 2002. And Janet Jackson? What?? "I know! Let's bring Janet Jackson onstage and have her sing  urlLink some songs from 1989 ! And then  urlLink she'll show her boob !  urlLink Genius !" I really don't get what she's even doing there. Is she jealous that  urlLink Michael 's been getting all the attention lately? Did she think if she let  urlLink Justin Timberlake rock her body  she could get a piece of  urlLink Britney 's publicity? Lady, you're 40. We don't want to hear about you lusting after boys at a party.  urlLink "I'm gonna have to ride it tonight"  — yuck. Why don't you go put on some more clothes and simmer down a little. Shit.

      So,  urlLink Janet Jackson and Jermaine Dupri , huh?  That one slipped right by me.  So I guess now that the whole  urlLink "wardrobe malfunction"  thing has died down (two months,  urlLink 200,000 letters to the FCC , and a series of congressional hearings later), what better to get Janet back in the media spotlight than rumors of a marriage? Hey,  urlLink it worked for Britney .   Which brings up an interesting point: What's Janet Jackson doing taking cues from Britney Spears? I mean, Janet has, what, 30 years more experience in the entertainment industry than Britney? Janet should be blazing the trails here, not following Britney around and scooping up her leftovers (like, you know,  urlLink Justin Timberlake ).  Also, how ugly is  urlLink Jermaine Dupri ? Blech.

      I have some things to say, but not enough of any one thing to write extensively. Does that make sense? I don't care.   •  urlLink I'm feewing wucky:  I just realized that if you click on "preferences" on Google's Web site you can change the language that its tips and messages are displayed in. So if you prefer to do your Web searches in, say,  urlLink Arabic  or  urlLink Scots Gaelic  or  urlLink Elmer Fudd , you're in luck.  •  urlLink Popsicle pushers:  It seems not even your neighborhood ice cream man is immune to street violence, particularly if your neighborhood is the Bronx.   •  urlLink It's not easy being green:  Usually when animals can blend into their surroundings, it saves them from becoming someone else's dinner. Unless you are a tiny green frog hiding in spinach. Thank god the little guy was spotted before having a run-in with a  urlLink Salad Shooter .  •  urlLink This one's for the children:   urlLink Jordan Knight , whom you'll fondly recall as the New Kid on the Block with the highest voice and longest rat tail, has remixed all the group's hits to make their circa-1990 songs sound "2004." As if that's necessary. I was curious to hear just how bad these remixes sound, so I went to  urlLink Amazon.com  looking for clips, but alas, none to be found. I did, however, learn that people who bought this CD also bought CDs by Nick Lachey, JC Chasez and the American Idol kids. That figures, huh?  That's all. Smell you later.

      Have you ever noticed that juice makers are liars? I bought some of that  urlLink Minute Maid Strawberry Raspberry "juice beverage"  (that's what they call it), and while perusing the label I noticed the No. 2 ingredient listed, after water, is pear juice. Next is "sweeteners" and after that is apple, strawberry and raspberry juices. So ... wouldn't this beverage be more accurately called Minute Maid Pear Apple Strawberry Raspberry? I know I'm being a copy editor here, but come on. Why keep the pear and apple juice a secret? I can't imagine anyone picking up the bottle and saying "Ew, it's got pear AND apple juice in it? Nevermind." It's not like they're putting some gross juice in it, like  urlLink freckle juice , or  urlLink pimp juice , or  urlLink Juice Newton . And why are they watering down this beverage with pear and apple juice anyway? Are they afraid the juice-drinking public would not be able to handle the strawberry and raspberry juices alone? Could my fixation on this topic be a manifestation of boredom from having an entire week off work with nothing to do but watch MTV and scrutinize the nutrition facts on fruit juice labels? Perhaps. Now if you'll excuse me,  urlLink "Taildaters"  is on.

      When did going to the grocery store get so complicated?  I mean, I'm all for  urlLink freedom of choice , but when a simple trip to the store becomes an hourlong odyssey through a labyrinth of innumerable yet nearly identical consumable items, something's terribly wrong.  Let me cull an example from my recent trip to the store.   (I should say "trips," plural, as I could not fit everything I wanted to buy in one cart, and though I briefly considered using two carts instead of making two trips, the folly that I envisioned would result from my feeble attempts to control two rickety, wandering carts brimming with frozen dinners and snack foods  quickly put that notion to rest.)  (And in case you were wondering what the hell I bought that took up so much room, considering I'd have to pretty much empty your grocer's freezer to fill up the cart with frozen dinners and snack foods, and then I'd just have to donate it all to a homeless shelter or something because my apartment is tiny and my stomach even tinier, let me assure you that it was really just one important, albeit large, item: a 24-pack of  urlLink Charmin . Because toilet paper is really the only item that you just can't do without, and I live in fear of the day when nature calls in the worst way and my only options are the stripped-bare cardboard roll or a terry cloth hand towel. Clearly, over-preparation is the only choice here.)  (But I digress.)  So, one of the things on my list, which I did not fit into my  urlLink haiku , was toothpaste. Used to be, the only real decision that had to be made here was what brand. I am loyal to Crest, dating back to the days of Sparkle Crest with those  urlLink glittery gel guys with the 50s-style hairdos and sunglasses , so that makes things easy, right?  Wrong.  So I'm walking through the personal hygiene aisle, awash in fluoride-fortified dental cleansing products, and I stop in front of the Crest section. Only then do I realize the complexity of the situation. There before me are approximately  urlLink 35 million different kinds of Crest toothpaste . We're talking row after row of pastes, gels and liquid gels.   Now, I'm a fan of the gel, so I know I can rule out anything that appears to resemble paste or liquid. Easy enough.  I also know that I want mint-flavored gel, none of that new-fangled cinnamon or citrus nonsense. This proves to be a little more difficult, as there is no "mint" flavor per se — rather, there are multiple varieties of mint-esque flavors with names so vague that it's impossible to tell which I'd prefer most. Should I pick fresh mint? Or cool mint? Perhaps cool peppermint? Or maybe energizing mint? How about extreme herbal mint? I'm disappointed to see there's no extreme headache mint, because that's what I'm really feeling at this point.  So in my puzzled state, I decide to abandon the flavor issue and focus entirely on the toothpaste's qualities. I want something that'll whiten my teeth. That should limit my choices, right?  Wrong, again.  It seems there is no shortage of Crest toothpastes with some kind of whitening ability. To wit:   Crest Extra Whitening Crest Dual Action Whitening Crest Baking Soda and Peroxide Whitening Crest Whitening Plus Scope Crest Tarter Control Whitening Plus Scope Crest Vivid White And so on and so forth. You get the idea.  So after I was forcibly escorted out of the store for kicking down the Crest display in a fit of indecisive rage, I started wondering why in the world Crest can't just combine all the best elements of all their different toothpastes and create some kind of  urlLink Ultra X-treme Toothpaste To The Max , a sort of dental panacea that would eliminate the need for myriad toothpaste varieties. You know, something like Crest Extra Vivid Dual Action Baking Soda and Peroxide Whitening With Tartar Control Plus Scope and Pro-Vitamins Maximum Hold Movie Theater Butter Flavor.   Don't tell me you wouldn't buy that. Mmm ... butter.  Speaking of which, that brings me to another difficult supermarket decision, this one in front of the microwave popcorn shelves. If only popcorn makers would adopt some sort of universal guideline for butter flavoring, perhaps one that involves a scale on which the level of buttery-ness could be marked for comparison purposes, so you don't waste half your day wondering which has just the right amount of butter: Butter, Old-Fashioned Butter, Extra Butter, Movie Theater Butter, Butter Lover's or Ultimate Butter?  And don't even get me started about what the hell differentiates  urlLink franks from wieners .   I will end this post with a fitting verse from a song by 1980s New Wave icons Devo: "In ancient Rome there was a poem about a dog who had two bones. He picked at one. He licked the other. He went in circles till he dropped dead."  urlLink Freedom of choice , indeed.

      So you know that  urlLink "I Don't Want You Back"  song that's always on MTV? The one that, even though it sounds pretty gay, you just can't bring yourself to change the station when it comes on the radio? The one that's sung by that whiny guy who might be good-looking if he didn't vaguely resemble  urlLink Danny from the New Kids on the Block  and  urlLink wear orange sweatsuits with Tims ? Yeah, that one. Have you heard  urlLink that one girl's response  to it? It's awesome. It seriously made me laugh out loud.  urlLink "Your sex is wack."  Ha.  In a related musical note (ha, again), have you noticed that  urlLink "I Don't Wanna Know"  song by Mario Winans apparently features P. Diddy and Enya?  Enya.  I thought we'd rid Top 40 radio of her after that "Sail Away" song in 1997. And I thought that again in 2000 after that ... other Enya song that was popular for some reason. And now she's infiltrated R&B. What's next? Lil' Jon and the Ying Yang Twins featuring Enya? God what a terrible song that'd be.

      I really need to go to the grocery store, as I am running out of things to eat. This is a serious matter, because I never really had very much food in my apartment to begin with. I think I'm down to a carton of milk that was best used two weeks ago, some ketchup packets and about 37 cans of Vanilla Coke. So this grocery shopping thing is getting urgent pretty quick.   In anticipation of me getting off my ass and driving the half-mile down the street to the  urlLink store , I have started writing a grocery list. In the form of a haiku. Ahem ...  urlLink juice boxes ,  urlLink cookies   urlLink microwave popcorn ,  urlLink cheese puffs   urlLink laundry detergent  Those are really just the essentials. You know, that which I cannot live without. If I feel so inclined, I might also pick up this stuff.  urlLink ice cream ,  urlLink Lucky Charms   urlLink green apple Fruit by the Foot   urlLink water for my frog  I know what you're thinking: "None of that stuff has any sort of nutritional value whatsoever, except for maybe the laundry detergent, and you probably aren't even going to eat that. You better pick up some of that fortified food they're making nowadays, with the folic acid and calcium and whatnot, before all that lack of essential vitamins stunts your growth."  Too late!

      I am proud to announce that, with the help of yours truly, Apple's  urlLink iTunes Music Store  has sold  urlLink 50 million songs .  That's right, my zealous song-downloading efforts, as well as $20.79 in hard-earned cash, have helped propel Apple to the forefront of the commercial music download market.  To celebrate this great acheivement, I am going to reveal, for the first time ever, the top 10 most played songs in my iTunes library.  Without further ado ...  10. "It Was a Good Day," Ice Cube 9. "Swing, Swing," The All-American Rejects 8. "Wat Da Hook Gon Be," Murphy Lee 7. "Fat Lip," Sum 41 6. "If I Could Go," Angie Martinez 5. "Hey Ya!" OutKast 4. "Can't Stop, Won't Stop," Young Gunz 3. "Tipsy," J-Kwon 2. "Through the Wire," Kanye West And the No. 1 most played song in my iTunes library is ... "Toxic," Britney Spears  Uh. Okay, so I have a really good excuse for that Britney thing. I won't bother you all with it here, but uh, trust me. It's really good.

       urlLink I guess there are no hookers in Afghanistan.   I wonder how he decided which one to do it with. Like, did he walk around the village, sizing them up, checking out what they had to offer? "My, don't you have a pretty mane. Now show me what you're working with!"   And don't you think the donkey would be like "What the ..." and get the hell away from that guy? I would, if I were a donkey. I would regardless, actually. Afghan guys are gross.

      One of you has a virus.  How do I know this? Because today I got an email from "noreply@yahoo.com" purporting to be from Yahoo! Mail administrators saying the following: "Our main mailing server will be temporary unavaible for next two days, to continue receiving mail in these days you have to configure our free auto-forwarding service." Attached to this message were some files that I did not download, because, despite what some people say,  urlLink I'm not a dumbass . Most of the time.  I am, however, curious, so I had Yahoo! scan them, and it turns out they were infected with a  urlLink worm . (Oddly enough, the worm is called "beagle." As opposed to a more worm-like name, such as  urlLink "Slimey" . Or "Gross.")  Which means that someone I know, who has my email address in their (probably Outlook Express) address book, and whose PC runs  urlLink Windows  and possibly  urlLink Kazaa , is a moron.  No offense. But come on. Don't you update your antivirus software? Well, me neither, but I don't have to. I have a  urlLink Mac . Ha.  Anyway, I didn't actually write this to be mean and make fun of people who  still  don't understand  urlLink why they shouldn't just download things off the Internet willy-nilly .   Yes I did. Suckers.

      I hate my neighbors.  This is not a new thing. I've hated them since the day they moved in and parked their U-Haul in my parking space. (Okay, so it's not actually  my  parking space, since the spaces aren't assigned. But it's the parking space I always park in, and I've grown very fond of it during our time together, and doesn't that count for something?)  I also hated them when they put that  urlLink lame welcome mat with the watercolor-esque rendering of a cat standing in a field of flowers  on their doorstep. And I hated them when they  decorated  desecrated their porch with  urlLink ugly white wicker patio furniture . And I hated them  urlLink that day they were cooking something so gross that the fumes came up through the floor and stunk up my apartment .  Most of all, I hated them at night when I couldn't sleep because all I could hear was loud but muffled TV noises traveling up through their ceiling to my floor. Once I got my iTunes-equipped iMac, however, I turned up the volume and got over it.  But now they've done did it. They've complained to the landlord about me. And I hate them once more.  You're probably wondering what I did that was so unreasonably annoying that my neighbors felt compelled to complain. I wondered that same thing when I was awakened in the wee hours of the morning (9 a.m.) by a phone call from the landlord relaying my neighbors' complaint. I spent the whole morning wondering, as a matter of fact. I went over the events of the previous night over and over again in my mind, trying to figure out at what point I became a neighborly nuisance. And then I finally I realized what I did: Nothing.  It was actually my sister who had been unreasonably annoying the night before. You see, we had just come home from San Jose, and she had to pee, but she let my friend Shannyn use the bathroom first. But Shannyn took an exceptionally long time in the bathroom, presumably because she became distracted by the mirror. So while Shannyn gazed at her reflection, Dani was doing the "I have to pee real bad" dance around my house, pacing and hopping and whining in an unreasonably annoying manner, made even more so by the fact that she was wearing sandals with heels, so when she paced and hopped and whined in the kitchen, she made quite a racket.   And that, my friends, was how I got my first noise violation.   Did you notice I said "first"? That's because I got another one the very next day. Except my sister wasn't around the night before, so I couldn't blame it on her. So, once more, I was left wondering — wondering how loud I could have been walking around in socks, wondering what I did differently that night than on any other night I spent by myself in my apartment, wondering why my neighbors were such whiny bitches.  So I responded the only way I know how — with a counter-complaint.  That's right. I emailed my landlord and told her all about how I don't understand how my walking around in my kitchen could bother my neighbors so much, considering they weren't asleep, which I know because their TV kept me up until 3 a.m., much like it does every other night. In fact, I'm not sure those people sleep at all, because I their television is the last thing I hear before I fall asleep and the first thing I hear when I wake up.   Which was all pretty much true, except for the part about keeping me up, because it doesn't. But it used to. So it was true once. And that's good enough for me.  Anyway, I'm pleased to report that, as I type this, I hear nothing but the quiet hum of my G4 — no loud but muffled TV noises emanating through the floor tonight.  I would claim victory here, if it wasn't for the fact that I am now forced to travel across the kitchen floor by way of a quiet, sock-clad shuffling motion, so as not to give the whiny bitches downstairs any ammunition.  Yep. I hate my neighbors.

      It seems prepubescent boys aren't the only thing Michael Jackson is obsessive about.  He's also  urlLink way into KFC.   Can you blame him though? KFC is  urlLink SO GOOD ! If I had a private jet, I'd probably eat nothing but KFC while I was flying around too.   Yes, I loooove KFC. But  urlLink  I hated the colonel, with his wee beady eyes, and that smug look on his face: "Oooh, you're going to buy my chicken, oooh."   In a related thought, doesn't the phrase "finger-licking good" sound super inappropriate when in close proximity to the words "Michael Jackson"?

      Have you noticed Jay-Z's been dressing better these days? Fewer size XXXL  urlLink sports jerseys  and  urlLink T-shirts . More  urlLink nice printed button-down shirts . Still rocking the jeans big enough to stuff a few Lil' Bow Wows in each leg, but that's cool. Keep it real.  My guess is  urlLink Beyonce 's behind it all. You know how girls are always trying dress their boyfriends better. By "better," of course, I mean "in whatever manner of clothing the girlfriend deems appropriately fashionable at that point in time." But the boyfriend goes along with it, because boyfriends will generally do whatever they can to prevent their girlfriends from  urlLink nagging . I can't say I blame them.   So yeah, Beyonce's totally behind Jay-Z's style shift. I bet she buys ungodly amounts of super expensive clothes for him, and while he's trying the new stuff on in his private dressing room, she sneaks into his closet large enough to comfortably house a family of four and grabs all the ratty old T-shirts and pants with the broken zippers and holes in the crotch and throws them into his top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art  urlLink Dumpster .  Of course, even then, Jay-Z's stocked with tons of  urlLink ugly Roc-a-Wear gear . And I bet when he goes to Beyonce's multimillion-dollar mansion to pick her up for a fabulously expensive date, in which they sail on a huge yacht to some remote tropical island and then buy it, he's  urlLink all Roc-a-Weared out , and I bet after she has a few of her servants open the door for him, she just stands there with a look of pure disgust on her face.   Beyonce: "You're not wearing THAT are you?" Jay-Z: "Jigga what?" Beyonce: "You look like you just jumped out of a  urlLink Ying Yang Twins  video." Jay-Z: "What you want me to do?" Beyonce: " urlLink Change clothes  ... and go!" Jay-Z: "Yes, dear."  Sexy sexy.

      You know how every once in a while (particularly if you're eating at  urlLink McDonald's ) you'll be chewing your food and something in there just doesn't seem quite right, so you pull it out of your mouth for closer inspection, and it's just like a chunk of fat or a piece of bone or somebody's thumb or ... wait. CHICAGO (Reuters) —  An Ohio woman was served a salad containing part of a restaurant worker's thumb sliced off while chopping lettuce, a health official said on Friday.   The woman "thought it was gristle or something like that" when she tried to chew the unexpected garnish, said William Franks, health commissioner for Stark County. Are you retching? Me too. Sorry about that.  But how happy will you be the next time you extract a partially chewed chunk from your mouth and find that it's just gristle? Unless it really does turn out to be a thumb. But that won't happen. Maybe.  Bon appetit!

      Did you hear the one about the  urlLink senior citizens throwing blows over the salad bar at their retirement home ?   And that's not a joke, which is why it's funny. Can't you just picture all those old people yelling and punching and running around? Except it'd be like in slow motion, because, you know, they're old.   I actually saw some old people fight once. At Burger King. There were like cliques of old people who would hang out all morning eating their  urlLink sausage Croissan'wiches  and 25-cent coffees, and they'd always argue over the  urlLink L.A. Times . Like, they were always trying to get to Burger King earlier than the others (in some cases, before we were even open ... and we open at 5:30 a.m.) so they'd have the first crack at the newspaper. And then they wouldn't share the sections with the old people they didn't like. And one time, two of the old guys got so heated over the newspaper that one of them pushed the other one down to the ground. It was sweet. I mean, sad. Yeah. Definitely sad.  So the managers decided that, since the old people clearly were unable to share the newspaper like civilized human beings, none of them would be allowed to read our newspapers any longer. That's right — we took away their newspaper-reading privileges. The old people were on restriction.   And this is why this whole brawl over the salad bar thing doesn't surprise me. Old people can get pretty testy. Although I must admit, I'd be pretty testy too if I noticed the guy in front of me was putting his dirty old fingers all over the food I was about to eat. Because I HATE when people touch food and then leave it for someone else. I mean, if I wanted your E.coli on my lettuce, I'd ask you for it. Jerk.   One thing that's questionable about this story, however, is the part where they say the guy's 80-year-old mother "jumped in to break up the fight." Surely they must have meant to say "shuffled in to break up the fight." Because I'm pretty sure that if that 80-year-old woman were physically able to jump anywhere, she'd jump right out of that twin bed, over her bedpan, out of the nurse's way, over the hedges and into a waiting taxi. Know what I'm saying?

      Every now and then, I run across an online quiz that really opens my eyes, one that illuminates some aspect of my life that I had — perhaps subconsciously — buried or ignored, one that teaches me something about myself I had not previously realized. One of these life-altering moments occurred tonight, when I discovered that  urlLink Raz B is my babydaddy.

      I just downloaded the first single off the Beastie Boys' new album off  urlLink iTunes . I don't know if I like it yet, though. I'll get back to you on that.  Oh, and if you get a chance, ch-check out their promo photo (it's on  urlLink iTunes ) and tell me, who is that old-ass guy standing to the left of Mike D? I mean, holy crap. It's like they've replaced Ad-Rock with a 60-year-old man. I hope that's just, uh, bad lighting or something.

       urlLink Blender magazine  has come out with its list of  urlLink The 50 Worst Songs Ever . I was mildly amused to find that one-tenth of these songs falls under the subcategory of Songs That I Either Paid Good Money For Or Recorded Off The Radio In Junior High, And Which I Probably Still Have On Cassette If You Feel Like Driving Around In My Car And Bumping Them:   "I'm Too Sexy"  by Right Said Fred (No. 49)  "Hangin' Tough"  by New Kids on the Block (No. 46)   "I Want to Sex You Up"  by Color Me Badd (No. 41)   "Rico Suave"  by Gerardo (No. 37)   "Ice Ice Baby"  by Vanilla Ice (No. 5)  Maybe this is just nostalgia talking, but I really don't see anything wrong with those songs, unless being irresistably catchy to the 13-year-old ear is wrong. And I don't think it is.  There are a number of other songs on the list I could subcategorize as well. For example ...   "Make Em Say Uhh!"  by Master P (No. 36) — Song That My Sister Paid Good Money For Just A Couple Of Years Ago, Which I Recorded On A Cassette And Still Listen To Regularly In My Car That Does Not Have A CD Player Because I Am Not Cool   "Mesmerize"  by Ja Rule feat. Ashanti,  (No. 45) — Song That, In Spite Of The Corny Video Where They Rip Off "Grease," I Actually Really Like But Would Never Admit It ... Whoops   "Greatest Love of All"  by Whitney Houston (No. 30) — Song Whose Lyrics I Successfully Used In An Article For The  urlLink Mustang Daily  But I'm Not Sure Anyone Noticed   Not to mention several Songs From The Mid-'80s That I Don't Remember Paying Any Attention To At The Time They Were Released But Whose Lyrics And Or Tune Inexplicably Started Running Through My Head When I Read The Titles, including  "Broken Wings"  by Mr. Mister (No. 19), and  "The Final Countdown"  by Europe (No. 27)  I'm kinda perplexed about the absence of Richard Marx songs on the list. I mean, who sucks more than Richard Marx? I sure can't think of anyone. Did you know he has an album called "Repeat Offender"? I'll say.

      My  urlLink couch  is famous! I saw it on  urlLink TV  tonight.   Hey, wait a second. What was my couch doing out so late? It didn't ask my permission to leave the house tonight. And it didn't even bring a jacket!  My couch is so busted.

      So, I was reading this  urlLink otherwise boring news story  about Condoleezza Rice's denials that President Bush had made up his mind to invade Iraq in January 2003, three months before he publicly announced his intentions, and I came across this paragraph:   In the January meeting, Rice said on CBS' "Face the Nation," she and Bush were at the president's ranch in Crawford, Texas, considering the Iraq situation. In such sessions, she said, Bush "kind of thinks out loud."  So that's the administration's excuse for President Bush: He didn't actually  mean  it when he said all that stuff in January about going to war; he was just thinking out loud.   Now, I thought that explanation sounded vaguely familiar. In 0.72 seconds flat, Google confirmed my suspicions: "I think out loud — that's my problem," Jessica Simpson told  urlLink USA Today  in January. She didn't actually  mean  it when she said all that stuff about buffalo wings being the meat of buffalo; she was just thinking out loud. See how that works?  So clearly what this means is, White House officials have become aware that Jessica Simpson is quickly succeeding Bush as America's Favorite Person To Make Fun Of, and they are stealing her lines in a desperate attempt to cling to what is possibly the only remaining incidence of Bush being America's Favorite anything at all.  It's rather sad, isn't it?

      I remember a kid named Manny who lived across the street from me when I was younger. I didn’t know him very well; we were in junior high, past the age where we might have played handball or rode bikes or caught bugs together, not quite at the age where we might have actually acknowleged each other’s existence, instead of completely ignoring each other, as junior highers are want to do.  I remember he was a year older and considerably cooler than me. Not “cool” in an athletic, student-body-president, object-of-innumerable-infatuations sort of way, but “cool” in an obnoxious, smart-alecky, troublemaker sort of way. The kind of “cool” most appreciated by 13-year-olds.  I remember we used to ride the same bus home from school. We probably also rode the same bus to school in the morning, but for some reason, possibly sleepiness, I have no memories of that. During the rides home he was always entertaining everyone, yelling and laughing and joking around. We all thought he funny. Our bus driver would probably have disagreed.  I remember the first time I heard someone say “Not!” As in, “I actually mean the opposite of what I just said!” It was Manny, on the bus ride home. I don’t remember what he was yelling “Not!” about, but I remember thinking it was so funny that I told my dad about it when I got home. I remember my dad thought it was funny, too.  Until a couple of days ago, I had forgotten all about that kid named Manny. I forgot about how he had lived across the street from me. I forgot about the bus rides home and “Not!” I forgot about how I hadn’t seen him in years. I forgot about how he got sent to prison.  I forgot that Manny killed someone.  Weird, the things you remember.

      I just watched the latest episode of the  urlLink Inferno , and I got three words for you: Katie is rad.  I mean, to watch Katie's team hatch their secret plot to toss $10,000 to the wind just to get her in the Inferno, to watch Katie during the mission put her chain-smoking on pause as she slowly comes to the realization that something pretty fucked-up was going on, and then to watch Katie, despite having borne the brunt of the itching powder and going up against self-proclaimed jumproping pro Julie, emerge from the Inferno victorious — that was awesome beyond words. I was totally rooting for her, just like Coral, but not, because I hate Coral. I still like Veronica though. Go figure.  But Katie's determination is crazy. You have to admire that. I mean, if it were me, I'd totally walk into the Inferno like "I'll show YOU, Road Rules!" and then I'd march right up to that treadmill, step on, and, after approximately 30 seconds of this rare physical exertion, promptly fall off and vomit. Or else I'd be scratching so wildly I'd lose my balance, trip over my newly  urlLink Puma-fied  feet, and promptly fall off and vomit. Or else I'd suddenly feel very faint, and realize I couldn't feel my fingers, and start crying and drooling, and when Darrell ran over to wipe my chin he'd apply a little too much pressure, and I'd promptly fall off and vomit. In any case, it'd be  urlLink Game Over .   So the fact that Katie could suck it up and tough it out and make her team look like a bunch of conniving jerks made me feel like dancing around to  urlLink that music that Mario hears when he catches one of those bouncing, flashing stars that live inside bricks that don't smash into little pieces when he head-butts them .   But did I actually dance? Only me and  urlLink Frog  know for sure.  p.s. Another reason Katie's cool: She's the only one who's got love for the  urlLink Beastie Boys .

      The Grey Album? Boring. But  urlLink the Black and Blue Album ? Genius.  P.S. December 4th is my birthday, too! I bet Jigga and I would get along really well. Like, if we went out hustlin' together, or big pimpin', we'd probably have a pretty good time. He'd be like, "Bounce with me, bounce with me" and I'd be like "You got it, Jay-Z!" Then he'd be like "Change clothes," so we'd put on all kinds of Roc-A-Wear gear and go the mall and make fun of all the Sean John stuff. Then we could get in his Bentley and drive over to 7-11 and get  urlLink Slurpees  because they are giving away iTunes songs, and if Jay-Z won a song he could give it to me because he sure doesn't need it since he's a millionaire and all. He could keep the Slurpee though.

      So, as I pulled into the parking lot of my apartment complex tonight, I was greeted by  urlLink Tupac . Or, more precisely, by the sound of a Tupac song blaring from an apartment across the way. Now, I like Tupac as much as the next guy, but IT'S ONE IN THE MORNING FOR CRYING OUT LOUD. Have these people no sense? I mean, here I am tiptoeing around in my socks for fear of awakening the bionic-eared beast that is my neighbors, and the dumbshits across the parking lot are thuggin' it up at full volume with no regard for those among us who have no tolerance for loud rap music. Luckily for them, I am not among the intolerant ones, so it won't be me calling the landlord tomorrow morning. In fact, I might have even yelled at them to turn it up louder, as I do like that song, had it not been for the high probability that in doing so I would have aroused the attention of my neighbors, which would then likely lead to me coming home from work tomorrow to find the locks changed. Bastards.  UPDATE: 1:53 a.m. There are now numerous people hollering along to "Wanna be a baller, shot caller, 20-inch rims on the Impala." Seriously.

      Kids these days. Walking around with their hair funny colors, and their pants drooping so low you can see their knickers. And then they got earrings stuck where there ain't no ears — in their noses, in their chins, even in their privates!

      The only good thing about the long and unfortunately unscenic drive up the 101 to the Bay Area is  urlLink K-Don . Why? Three words:  urlLink Kid 'N Play.  I strongly believe that the world would be a better place if it had a soundtrack consisting entirely of rap songs from the early '90s.  •  •  •  While driving through Salinas, I heard that one Big Pun song.  urlLink "Hot tub Sippin' bubbly Rubbin' your spot love Got you screaming 'Punish me' "  You know what I'd be screaming? "Get the hell off me!" The man weighed 400 pounds. When he says "I'm not a player, I just crush a lot," you gotta believe him.   •  •  •  I must say that, even after months of its seemingly continuous airplay, I'd rather listen to "Hey Ya" 50 times in a row than listen to "I Like the Way You Move" once.   •  •  •  Yep, yep, yep, it's  urlLink all G-double O-D good .

      I bought a  urlLink yellow T-shirt from J. Crew . I like it. Even though it's yellow. I can't remember the last time I wore yellow. Probably in the '70s. Don't remember much of the '70s. I smoked a lot of dope back then, you know.  Speaking of the '70s, Jackie from  urlLink "That '70s Show"  is dating  urlLink Macaulay Culkin . Even though he's  urlLink ugly .  Speaking of ugly, note to the large-assed woman I saw today wearing tight-fitting camouflage pants: It's not working. Your ass still looks fat.  Speaking of fat, sometimes a little extra body weight comes in handy. Particularly if you are a  urlLink small rodent in the path of a vaccum cleaner .  Speaking of vaccum cleaners, and yellow, but not fat or ugly, I thought about buying one of  urlLink these  after seeing the incredibly convincing commercial on TV. Weak suction? Tell me about it. Clogged filters? I feel your pain, man. So then I saw the vaccum at  urlLink Target . It cost $399. And all of a sudden, weak suction and clogged filters didn't seem so bad.

      I totally just bought four cookbooks. And I don't even cook.  I'm such a sucker.  It all started when I got this thing in the mail from  urlLink The Good Cook  that offered me four cookbooks for $1 each if I'd just join their book club. I'd only have to buy two more books at regular price in the next year. Unless, of course, I took advantage of their special bonus offer and bought one additional cookbook now for half price; then I'd only have to one more book at regular price in the next year.   You'd think I'd have known better than to get mixed up with these cookbook folks, having been previously taken for a ride by  urlLink Columbia House , where "regular price" means "twice as much as you'd pay at  urlLink Target ."  But then you'd be underestimating my suckerability.  You know what did me in? While waiting for  urlLink "The Inferno"  season finale to come on, I watched  urlLink "Desserts Unwrapped"  on the  urlLink Food Network . This made me hungry. And I started thinking about all the delicious desserts I could make, if only I knew how to make desserts. Next thing I know, Road Rules has kicked Real World's ass, and I'm ordering cookbooks like they're going out of style.  So, yeah, any day now I'll open my mailbox to find  urlLink "The Artful Cupcake" ,  urlLink "Whimsical Bakehouse" , and a couple other selections that I can't tell you about because they are going to be gifts, and you can't keep a secret.  I can tell you this: There are cupcakes in your future. Lots and lots of cupcakes.

      Why is it that every time the cops on  urlLink "Cops"  pull someone over and start asking questions, the suspected ne'er-do-well always prefaces his (or, tonight on  urlLink "Cops: Bad Girls,"   her ) answers with "I'm not going to lie to you" — and then totally lies? As if the police officer who just pulled you over for driving a stolen vehicle the wrong way down a one-way street at approximately 2.5 times the speed limit at 4 a.m. is going to be like, "Well ... since you said you aren't going to lie to me ... then I guess I have no choice but to believe you. So whose 10 kilos of coke is that, anyway?"

       urlLink Worst idea ever.  Why? Because under the terms of this bill, I could be sent to Iraq. That's right, me — all 105 pounds of spastic, limp-limbed, nausea-prone, lilly-livered Chrissy, in the harsh desert war zone of Iraq, forced to battle legions of America-hating, rocket-launcher-wielding, fury-filled, wild-eyed, unkempt insurgents. Without cheeseburgers. How much would that suck? The gubment says  urlLink it ain't gonna happen . We'll see about that.

      So you know that  urlLink Hoobastank  song that everyone likes? The one that's on the radio all the time? With the video where the singer guy runs over some girl and then she's dead but not really?  I like it.  Took me long enough, huh? I know, I know. It's just that I can't like mainstream radio alternative rock songs right off the bat, especially those slow ballad-y ones. Something inside me (vocal chords) screams "Mainstream alternative radio rock! BAH! Change the station!" Probably because deep down I know that if I listen, I will like. And sure enough. After weeks (months?) of tactical avoidance, sometime in the last few days I accidentally listened to the whole song all the way through. And now I like it.  So I've been listening to it on repeat for the last hour (I'm obsessive with music like that) and, I must say, I do hope that not-really-dead girl forgives the poor Hoobastank guy. I'm not sure I can take any more of his remorseful, heartbroken pleading. Because what if they don't get back together, and he keeps making these heartfelt mainstream alternative radio rock songs, and I keep liking them? What if I become a full-fledged Hoobastank fan? How embarrassing would that be?  For any full-fledged Hoobastank fans out there who think there's nothing wrong with that, I just want you to know: I found a reason to NOT be a Hoobastank fan. And the reason is: You, as a Hoobastank fan, probably find it perfectly reasonable to  urlLink pay $25 a year to be a member of their fan club .  Kids, this is not reasonable at all. Go spend that $25 on something useful. Like  urlLink cocaine .

      So I just now opened iTunes and saw something called " urlLink Party Shuffle ." I guess it appeared last night after I did the Software Update thing for the first time since like January. Anyway, I promptly clicked on it, because how can you not click on an icon named "Party Shuffle"? I mean, how fun does "Party Shuffle" sound? I can't wait to find out more! My first thought was, New Dance Move!, perhaps something all partygoers could do simultaneously, along the lines of the "Electric Slide," or the "Boot Scoot Boogie." (I'm actually not entirely sure whether that last one is a dance or just something  urlLink that cowboy guy from the Real World  made up.)  Disappointingly, the "Party Shuffle" is not a cool new dance. It's actually just a list of songs iTunes randomly selects from your library, I guess to save you the trouble of picking out party songs yourself. So, were I to throw a party right this minute, you'd have the pleasure of hearing the following funky beats:  • "Faded" soulDecision • "Wake Up" Snoop Dogg • "B.O.B." OutKast • "Ms. Jackson" OutKast • "So Fresh, So Clean" OutKast • "In Da Wind" Trick Daddy • "Follow the Light" Dungeon Family • "Can't Stop, Won't Stop" Young Gunz • "What Ya Want" Ruff Ryders • and a ton of Beastie Boys songs, including "Boomin' Granny"  Interestingly enough, it seems as though iTunes is aware that any party I'd throw would suck, and accordingly selected only 56.9 minutes of music, just long enough for the three people I know to arrive, exchange pleasantries, eat a couple of cupcakes, and then make a break for it just as I pull out my  urlLink Muppets Monopoly .  I should have known you guys were more of a  urlLink Simpsons Clue  crowd.

      With all things '80s coming back to haunt us like zombies from "Thriller," it was only a matter of time before we started seeing the  urlLink Garbage Pail Kids  again.  You remember those, right? The trading cards featuring pictures of Cabbage Patch Kids suffering from an endless variety of whimsically grotesque deformities, illnesses and injuries, often involving vomit, snot and worms.   This time around, the cards include some new characters inspired by such beloved pop stars as Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera.   Now, Justin Timberleg doesn't look a thing like Mr. Rock Your Body. But the artists did a pretty good job with  urlLink Christina Ugliera  — she looks almost as dirrty as the real thing, if you ask me.  You know what the best part of Garbage Pail Kids was?  urlLink Finding one that had that name of someone you know  and then being like "Ew! Gross! This is YOU!"  I'm  urlLink Christine Vaccine .

      Saturday's episode of SNL was Jimmy Fallon's last.  You might expect me to be terribly upset by this. "Chrissy," you might say, "won't you miss Jimmy's  urlLink controversially tousled hair , his Adam Sandler-esque song parodies, and his tendency to distract his castmates during skits by giggling uncontrollably?"  Yes, I will. (Heavy sigh.)  But it's all for the better. See, he's thinking he's moving on to bigger and better things, like lead roles in blockbuster movies and multiplatinum albums, which would elevate his celebrity status to one of mythic proportions.   But, really, what are the chances of that? I mean, I hate to be a pessimist (ha), but how many SNL grads have achieved that kind of success after leaving the show? For every  urlLink Bill Murray ,  urlLink Mike Meyers ,  urlLink Ben Stiller  and  urlLink Adam Sandler  there's a  urlLink Charles Rocket ,  urlLink Tony Rosato ,  urlLink David Koechner  and  urlLink Dean Edwards .  Not to mention  urlLink Gilbert Gottfried .   So, if post-SNL history is any indication, he'll star in a few so-so movies, make some guest appearances on popular TV shows, record a few more  urlLink comedy albums  no one will buy, make some guest appearances on unpopular TV shows, join fellow SNL alumni Gilbert Gottfried and Victoria Jackson on  urlLink "Hollywood Squares"  and quietly fade into obscurity.  And that's when I will woo him with a  urlLink very pricey omelet .

      Have I told you that my driver's license is expired?  Not like, expired a week or so ago. More like, five months ago. You know, way back in 2003, the year 50 Cent dominated MTV, reality TV was all the rage, and America was at war with Iraq.   Hmm, that probably doesn't bring my point home quite the way I wanted it to. Allow me to further emphasize the extent of my license's expiration:  • If my license were cheese, it'd be  urlLink viejo y petrido .   • If my license were a TV show, it'd be on permanent hiatus.  • If my license were a president, it'd be one of the dead ones.   So yeah, long gone.  But this has not been a problem for me, as I never really do anything that requires proof of current identification anyway — I don't smoke, I don't drink, I don't rent pornos,  urlLink I don't vote . I actually don't ever leave my apartment. So what do I need ID for, anyway?  I'll tell you what I need it for: my ego.  So that the next time I'm at Vons picking up some margarita mix for my mom (she's a lush) and the horse-faced cashier gives me some of that "Whatever, teeny-bopper" attitude, I can bust out my non-expired driver's license like "That's right, horse-face, now bag that shit." Which would have been much less demoralizing than what happened the last time I was at Vons, when I busted out my expired license, got attitude, insisted I was 26, got more attitude, and left empty-handed.  Damn my youthful good looks.

      So I was reading about how  urlLink A.C. Slater totally cheated on his wife of two weeks  (can't you see  Jessie Spano shaking her head in disgust) and somehow I ended up on IMDB reading  urlLink memorable quotes from "Saved by the Bell."  Now, I always prided myself on not watching that show, because it seemed super stupid, and I was probably busy anyway, reading encyclopedias or filling out those  urlLink Publisher's Clearing House sweepstakes  forms. But damn if those quotes weren't funny. I mean, I'm really sorry I didn't give this show a chance. The jokes are just so ... well, let me give you an example so you can see for yourself.  Mr. Belding:  Screech, you can't elope.      Screech:  Who're you calling a cantaloupe, you melon head? I would continue to elaborate on my unexpected enjoyment of this goofy banter, but that hilarious quote has me hyperventilating and I need my hands free so I can hold a paper bag to my mouth and breathe before I pass out from lack of carbon dioxide. Cantaloupe ... genius!

      For as long as I can remember, I've wanted to kick ass. Unfortunately, the size of my muscles does not match the size of my irrepressible rage. But once I get my hands on one of these  urlLink bad boys , and figure out how to persuade my archenemies to sit down on it and pull the lever, I'll be unstoppable.

      Everyone's favorite dictionary publisher, Merriam-Webster (a company that, as you likely know, was co-founded by brothers George and Charles Merriam and  urlLink Emmanuel Lewis ), has released their  urlLink Top 10 Favorite Words  for 2004. Because I have a feeling you're not going to bother to click on the link, I will define each word below, and include an example of its usage. Ahem.  1.  defenestration  a throwing of a person or thing out of a window.  If Chrissy knew one of those circus strong men, she'd certainly ask him to engage a certain assistant city editor in defenestration.   2.  serendipity  the faculty or phenomenon of finding valuable or agreeable things not sought for.  Chrissy knew it was serendipity when she found that Tootsie Roll Pop in her car, because it was lunchtime.   3.  onomatopoeia  the naming of a thing or action by a vocal imitation of the sound associated with it (as buzz, hiss).  The waiter at the fancy Greek restaurant didn't laugh when Chrissy ordered the onomatopoeia.   4.  discombobulate  upset, confuse.  A drive around town can easily discombobulate Chrissy, probably because she's mildly retarded.   5.  plethora  excess, superfluity; also : profusion, abundance.  Chrissy has a plethora of white T-shirts from the Gap.   6.  callipygian  having shapely buttocks.  If a strange man were to refer to Chrissy as callipygian, there is a very good chance that she would throw up on him.   7.  juxtapose  to place side by side.  When you juxtapose Chrissy and  urlLink a drawing of Popeye's girlfriend Olive Oyl , you can clearly see the former is the pinnacle of ass-kickin' buffness.   8.  persnickety  a: fussy about small details, fastidious; b: having the characteristics of a snob.  At her workplace, Chrissy continually demonstrates that she is versatile enough be both definitions of persnickety at once.   9.  kerfuffle  a disturbance or fuss.  Wherever Chrissy goes, she causes a kerfuffle, particularly if she screams and flails her arms about wildly.   10.  flibbertigibbet  a silly flighty person (or  urlLink a foolish woman ).  You could say Chrissy is a flibbertigibbet, but then she'd probably kick your ass.   Now, don't get me wrong, those are all good words, and I can certainly see why some people with less extensive vocabularies would consider them their favorites. But, I'm sure you'll agree, there are plenty better words out there, words more deserving of a spot on that list than "serendipity" and that other gay shit. So here, in no particular order, are Chrissy's Top 10 Favorite Words for 2004:  1.  urlLink butthole   2.  urlLink lop   3.  urlLink booty   4.  urlLink cockamamie   5.  urlLink hornswoggled   6.  urlLink zoinks   7.  urlLink dastardly   8.  urlLink sabotage!   9.  urlLink fandango   10.  urlLink cupcake   Mmm ... cupcakes.

      Today I cleaned out the trunk of my car. Here's what I found: 4 plastic shopping bags, 2 newspapers, 6 pieces of junk mail, 2 water guns, 2 pages of Yahoo! Maps directions to Costa Mesa, 1 purple pen clipped to 1 yellow legal pad, 1 white hooded sweatshirt, 2 Happy Meal toys, and 1 textbook for a public-speaking class I took 3 years ago. Not bad.  Since I'm on the numbers tip, let's talk about  urlLink that crazy Southern Baptist family  that has 14 kids, with a 15th on the way, and they all have names that start with J.   That totally rhymed.   Anyway, yeah, 15 kids with J names. Names like Jedidiah, Jeremia and Josiah. And guess what the dad's name is? If you guessed Jim Bob, you sure know your baby-makin' rednecks. Not that there's anything wrong with baby-makin' rednecks. My best friend is a baby-makin' redneck. Hey, I just channeled  urlLink Jeff Foxworthy :  You might be a baby-makin' redneck if ... you're making so many babies that you can't afford to buy them all clothes so you make them sew their own, just like the crazy Dugger family, who clearly need some sort of contraception intervention, perhaps in the form of  urlLink Trojan Man .   Yeah, you read that right. Jim Bob Dugger. You can't make this stuff up.

      Best Web site ever:  urlLink Dogster .   You might dismiss this site as a lame ripoff of  urlLink Friendster , but I say it's taken the weak Friendster premise and improved on it. Because other people's dogs are way more interesting to look at than other people's friends.  Out of all the puppies on the site, I love  urlLink Mongo  the best. He's no Jake, of course, but he's cute nonetheless. And his name fits him perfectly.  If I were to get a dog, I think I'd name it Barney. Even if it were a girl. Doesn't Barney sound like a good dog name? Or maybe I'd name it Ernie, after my dearly departed fish. Or Farley, after a bulldog I saw at the beach.  You know what would be a funny name for a dog? Cat. Think about it. "This is my dog, Cat." That's funny.  Hey, look,  urlLink my sister's on Dogster . Heh heh.  Oh, and speaking of dogs, did you see Snoop on SNL? He did a skit about how sad he was now that "Friends" is over ...  urlLink funny stuff .

      He wandered away over the weekend. We can't find him. He hasn't found us.  He's so old, and he can't hear very well, and he's all alone. He's away from his doghouse, away from his food dish and water bowl, away from Brandi, away from us. Away from home.  Keep your fingers crossed.

      So, did I tell you about how I decided to go running the other day? Like, for exercise? Worst decision I ever made. Well, maybe not the  worst  decision I ever made. The worst decision I ever made was probably the time I decided to sniff the new laundry detergent my dad bought to see if it smelled as good as  urlLink Surf  and consequently discovered that laundry detergent powder burns like a mother when it goes up your nose.  Yeah. That was definitely the worst.  So, anyway, I ran. For a few feet, anyway. Then I had to stop, for fear that I would soon exhaust the dregs of physical strength left in my body, forcing me to collapse on the sidewalk in a pool of sweat and tears, a scene made all the more tragic by the fact that I was only about half a block from my apartment.   So then I walked home and took a nap. But that is not the last the sidewalks of Rockview Place have seen of me! I will not give up! I will keep trying to run! And someday you will see me running along  urlLink the streets of San Luis Obispo , a blur of  urlLink Adidas  and prominent calf muscles, and I will be smiling, because I'm not throwing up.

      There was a  urlLink phone book  sitting outside my front door yesterday. When I saw it, I was on my way to work, so I just tossed it in the house and left. Today I went to put the new phone book in my designated phone-book drawer, only there was no room, because there were already  urlLink two other   urlLink phone books  in there.   That's right. I am now the proud owner of three phone books.   I have just one question: Why? All of the three phone books cover the same semi-rural area. None of the three phone books are more than seven months old. Each of the three phone books appears to have been published by a different company. Shouldn't one phone book suffice? It's not like this is some hustling and bustling metropolitan area with its millions of residents constantly in search of elusive phone numbers. This is cow town. Cows don't have phones.  Now I have to figure out just what I'm going to do with these three phone books. I certainly won't be using them to look up phone numbers — all my business is taken care of via El Interneto. And as for the business that isn't taken care of that way, well,  urlLink Domino's  prints its phone number right on its coupons, so it's all good.  So what do I use all these phone books for? Here are my ideas so far:   Step stool  I'm pretty short, so I'm always looking for easier ways to reach things than jumping up and down, climbing, or enlisting the aid of a tall person. The idea of standing on a stack of phone books sounded promising until I tried it and realized that I was only five inches off the ground. From that vantage point, I was able to see that my three phone books were not going to be much help in this regard. To get within reaching distance of my uppermost kitchen cupboards, I'd clearly need phone books from a much more heavily populated area, such as  urlLink India .   Weight training  The circumference of my biceps is about equal to that of an average-sized person's pack of  urlLink Rolos . Therefore, I could stand to bulk up a bit. And what better way to build muscle than to repeatedly lift a short stack of floppy, unwieldy phone books? Bonus: If you accidentally drop the phone books on your head, it would hurt considerably less than, say, a dumbbell.   Airborne defense  You never know when the terrorists are going to strike. And you never know how they'll strike, either. So it's best to be prepared for anything, which is why I think having my own personal  urlLink fleet of airplanes  would be well-worth the time and effort put into constructing them. ( urlLink Origami  isn't as easy as it looks, you know.)   Percussion in my one-man band  That is, my one- wo man band. If you're wondering why you haven't heard of my band yet, it's because I'm still in the practice stage. So far, I have mastered the  urlLink kazoo ,  urlLink maracas  and the  urlLink keytar . All I need is a stack of phone books to drum on and some cymbals strapped to my knees and I'll be jammin' in no time.

      I just remembered that when I was little, I had a book about grammar. Well, not really about grammar, I guess. I think it was kind of, like, secretly about grammar. It was grammar on the down low. Like you know how children's books appear to be about one thing to children, but adults can see the book is really about something else entirely? So, when I was little, the book appeared to be about (my memories of this are very fuzzy) some guy walking around a factory where sentences were made, and something malfunctioned so all the sentence parts were messed up. The one thing I remember most is that there were "dangling modifiers," like they were actually dangling off scaffolding or something. Anyway, now I can see that the book was really trying to teach me grammar. I guess it worked, seeing as how my job's all about the grammar. But isn't that weird? I really liked this book about sentence structure, and then like 20 years later I'm a copy editor. Weird.  You know, books seemed so much more interesting when I was a little kid. When reading was still all new and exciting. Now reading is old and boring. Like  urlLink Congress .  I learned to read when I was 3. According to my parents, one day I was sitting on the floor with a  urlLink TV Guide , babbling, which I guess I did a lot, because they just ignored me. Then after a while they started listening to the babble and realized I was actually reading the TV Guide aloud. So I guess that means my first favorite book was the TV Guide. That figures, huh? Because I watch all kinds of TV.  This got me to thinking about other books I really liked when I was little. There are a few books I remember carrying around and reading all the time whose titles and subject matter I cannot recall for the life of me. I had one book that was yellow and had something to do with  urlLink Art Linkletter . I'm not even really sure who Art Linkletter is, but I remember his name from this book. I had another book that I think was one of those "random facts" type of books, but the only "random facts" I remember is that it talked about how you could kill werewolves with silver bullets and vampires with wooden stakes. I only remember this because it scared me.   There are a couple of books whose titles I do remember ... but the title's just about all I can remember.   Septimus Bean and his Amazing Machine:  I remember nothing about this book except for the cartoony illustrations of medievally dressed characters, which I think about every time I go to the  urlLink Round Table  in A.G. and sit at the booth with posters of similarly drawn pizza-loving knights and maidens on the wall. For the longest time (that is, until just now, when I did a Google search) I thought the name of the book was "Septimus Bean and his Flying Machine," so that probably means Septimus Bean's machine is so amazing because it flies. Or maybe it cooks pizza.    urlLink The Very Hungry Caterpillar :  My cousins had this book, so I got to look at it whenever we went to their house. I remember thinking it was the greatest book ever when I was little, but I looked it over at Barnes & Noble recently and was not impressed. I suppose my standards for interactive entertainment have raised considerably since I was 4.   Bagdad Ate It : I used to check out this book from my elementary school's library all the time so I could bring it home and read it to Tommy when he was a baby. From what I remember, it was about a little puppy that grew into a big hungry dog that ate everything, including, if I recall correctly, a brown paper bag, and that's how he got his name. But that last part might not be true. That might be just how, as a child, I imagined he got his name, and over the years my mind distorted the imaginary hypothesis into the truth. You know how that goes.    urlLink Bread and Jam for Frances :  Again, I don't actually remember anything about the plot of this book. What I remember are the pictures of  urlLink bread with jam on it and eggs in little cups . A 32-page book, and all I remember is the food. So I was just reading about the book on Amazon.com, and it seems to be about Frances being picky and only wanting to eat bread and jam, so that's all her mom gives her, until she gets sick and tired of bread and jam and decides she wants to eat what everyone else is eating. Now I can see why I really liked this book when I was little: Frances' mom was nice. My mom would have NEVER let me eat bread and jam all the time. If we were eating dinner, and I had recited some kind of cute little poem about how I don't like what we were having for dinner, and then asked for bread and jam, my mom would have yelled "EAT YOUR FUCKING DINNER!" so loudly that people the next block over would have been frantically stuffing food in their mouths and whimpering. My mom was a dinner nazi. I remember sitting at the kitchen table, alone, in the dark, staring at a pile of canned beets left on my plate, while the rest of the family watched TV just a few feet away, for what seemed like hours, until my mom finally gave up and sent me to my room. To this day, I do not eat beets.   So anyway, I haven't seen any of those books in years. I do, however, run into the TV Guide from time to time. I don't read it, though. That's what Channel 6 is for.

       urlLink Donnie Wahlberg  was on " urlLink Boomtown ."  urlLink Joe McIntyre  was on " urlLink Boston Public ." And now Jordan Knight is the latest New Kid to land a starring role on national television —  urlLink he's joining "The Surreal Life."   Poor Jordan. That's got to be a blow to the ego. I mean, Donnie and Joe are on these critically acclaimed (albeit short-lived) series, and Jordan's sitting at home in front of the TV asking his cat, "Why can't I get a piece of this?" So he starts going to auditions and putting himself out there, but no one's interested, even though he got rid of his  urlLink rat tail . Then  urlLink VH1  comes knocking, and Jordan's desperation flings open the door and invites VH1 in for some  urlLink Taster's Choice . "A reality TV show for celebrity has-beens? I'm there!" So sad.      Which New Kid most resembled a hairy ass primate?         Joey Joe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donnie D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jordan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ape&nbsp;Face&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;

      You know what my  urlLink horoscope  says today? "You're a funny person." Isn't that amazing? It's totally right! I  am  a funny person! I think those astrologers are on to something after all.  Now,  urlLink this  proves it. The part about me being "slightly dangerous" — that's right on. In fact, it might even be an understatement. Beware of Chrissy!  I've actually been trying to warn people about my dangerousness for a while now, but nobody seems to take me seriously. For example, I used to sing the chorus of  urlLink Eminem's "Kill You"  to my brother, but I'd change "Shady" to "Chrissy." For some reason, this did not frighten him. He'd just laugh. I'll just have to show him that Chinese astrology thing as proof that I really am  urlLink bad news .

      To the nine people who stumbled upon my blog in the last week while searching the Web for " urlLink ghetto baby names ": Sorry to disappoint you. No ghetto baby names here!  Although I am curious as to why you guys are all looking for ghetto baby names. Is there a little ghetto baby on the way, and you can't find any appropriate names in the  urlLink baby book section at Barnes & Noble ? Do they have Barnes & Noble in the ghetto? You never hear rappers talk about chillin' at Barnes & Noble. Maybe rappers just don't go there because that's where all their babymamas are hanging out, looking up ghetto baby names.  Hey, speaking of rappers, what's up with  urlLink that crazy DMX ?

      Tonight at work an intern sat in the  urlLink cubicle  next to mine. All night long, she kept turning to me and saying, "Can I ask you a question?" All night long, I fought back the urge to turn to her and holler "NO!"   But it'd be too late because, apparently unbeknownst to her, she had already asked me a question. I hate it when people ask me if they can ask me a question. Because they are asking two questions when only one question is necessary. It's a waste of time. Just ask me the question already. Geez.  Actually, don't ask me the question. Don't bother me. I'm working. See how I'm staring intently at my computer screen? How my fingers are hitting the keys on my keyboard in rapid succession? How I have a thoughtful, or possibly bored, look on my face? That means I'm busy thinking and stuff. So leave me alone.  Of course, I answered all her questions, because I realized this would prevent her from screwing things up, which would annoy me even more than all her questions put together. And the more questions I answer now, the fewer questions I'll have to answer later. I hope.   urlLink If only I could telecommute.

      So, I was just beginning to think that maybe having Ah-nold as governor wasn't all that bad, when I found out that  urlLink he wants to kill lovable puppies and kittens . ( urlLink Here's the username and password .) Sch'negger wants to repeal the Hayden Act, which requires animal shelters to hold stray dogs and cats for six days. He'd rather have those dogs and cats euthanized within 72 hours — even if the shelter was closed during that time. And he wants other stray pets, like birds, hamsters, turtles and pot-bellied pigs, killed immediately. And it might not even matter if a pet's been microchipped, because the animal shelters wouldn't be required to search for the pet's owners.   That's why I've now decided that he sucks.  He's doing this just to cut $14 million from the state budget. That sounds like a lot of money, until you consider how much alternate budget-cutting solutions would save. For example,  urlLink getting rid of the state's 300 advisory boards and commissions that are pretty much good for nothing anyway  ( urlLink username and password ) would save more than $360 million a year. Plus, no lovable puppies and kittens would be killed in the process. Sounds like a good deal to me. How about it, Arnie?

      It seems all the cool kids are playing  urlLink video games from back in the day.   And why shouldn't they? That was some fun stuff.   I used to play Super Mario Bros. like all day long. And I'd get really stressed out about it, too. I'd get all into it, and if anyone bugged me while I was playing you can bet there'd be hell to pay. We found this cassette tape where either me or my sister recorded me playing Mario Bros. for like half an hour. All you could hear on the tape was the theme music for like ever, and then there's a part where I yell at my sister for distracting me or something. And then I beat a level, and you could hear me running down the hall hootin' and hollerin' about it to my parents, as if they cared. It's really a very fascinating recording.  This didn't occur to me at the time, but isn't it a bit strange that out of all the people who could potentially save the life of a princess, it takes a couple of Italian plumbers with bad mustaches? You know what else is strange? That Mario can  urlLink bust a move .  I also liked to play  urlLink Excitebike  once in a while. I would make my own track, picking the ramps and obstacles according to the letters they were assigned, so the resulting course would spell something really meaningful, like "Chrissy is cool" or "I love NKOTB," although no one else would know the course spelled anything because all they'd see were jumps and mud puddles. But I knew what it said, and that was enough.   urlLink Adventure Island  was a cool game. We didn't own it, so I'd have to borrow it or have my mom rent it. I don't remember much about it, except that you were this little island boy who could skateboard around and try to get fruit. That actually still sounds like a lot of fun to me. I would love to be able to skate around grabbing apples and bananas out of the air. That would rule.   urlLink Duck Hunt  was cool for a little while. It kind of lost its appeal when a friend of mine showed me that you could point the gun so it touched the middle of the TV screen and just pull the trigger, and no matter where that duck was, he'd get shot.   I was all about  urlLink Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!  for a while. My mom bought that game for my dad, but I played it way more. He could only get to  urlLink Soda Popinski , while I could actually make it all the way to  urlLink Mike Tyson . He punched me out every time, though, as promised. That game also caused me major stress. I'd play it all afternoon and would have to take breaks because I'd get headaches and my thumbs would hurt. I was hardcore.   urlLink Paperboy  — now that was a great game. I LOVED playing Paperboy. I would break every window, which is probably pretty close to what would happen had I been a paperboy in real life. Hey, and now I work at a newspaper. Is that weird or what?  You know what's a deceptively difficult game?  urlLink Pac-Man . I never really played it when I was younger, except for this one time at  urlLink Shakey's . Oh man, I just had a Shakey's flashback ... cheese pizza, chicken and mojos ...  urlLink Wherefore art thou, Shakey's ?  But I digress. So yeah, to the casual observer, Pac-Man appears to be cake. You just go around eating the little pellets and then you eat the big pellets and the ghosts turn blue and you eat the ghosts and you're done. But I played it just recently and, let me tell you, this game is so not cake. I know there's some kind of strategy involved here, but I have yet to figure it out. See, I try to eat all the little pellets and save the big pellets for later, but then some crazy ghost gets too close and then I have to eat a big pellet, and then I have to chase him down to show him what's up, but he's a quick little sucker, and I just barely get to eat him before the big pellet wears off, but by this time his little ghost friend is creepin' on the come up, so I have to go eat another big pellet, and then I chase him down, and so on and so forth until all the big pellets have been eaten and there's still about 20 million little pellets left but I can't do anything about that because I've been cornered by a bunch of pissed-off ghosts. Then it's Game Over. So tough.  You know, it's too bad my brother stole our old Nintendo games and controllers. I could really go for some  urlLink Dragon Warrior  right about now.

      Did you hear the one about  urlLink the woman who, after falling off a toilet at a hotel, tried to sue the hotel for damages, not because she was injured, but rather because the incident caused her to develop a toilet phobia ?  What a bunch of crap. I mean, I could understand her being afraid of toilets if something really traumatic had happened while she was sitting on it, like if the toilet ate her or something. But she only fell off the thing. What's that, like a two-foot drop? Come on. Annoying? Yes. Embarrassing? Could be. But phobia-inducing? I think not.  If every minor mishap or unfortunate consequence I suffered due to to my use of an object or participation in an activity resulted in an irrational and obsessive fear, I'd ... be irrationally and obsessively fearful of a lot of things.  Here is a partial list of things I'd claim to be phobic about if I were that crazy toilet lady: • ovens • laundry soap • volleyballs • soccer balls • roller coasters • swimming pools  • tennis • rain-soaked concrete steps • beds • pink lemonade • Pontiacs  See, and I'm not scared of any of those things. Especially not pink lemonade. Don't give me any, though.

In the process, I ...  • spent approximately $150 on  urlLink cake-making supplies  and  urlLink ingredients ; • washed the same bowls, spatulas and measuring cups about 15 times; • stained three T-shirts — two with melted chocolate and one with pink frosting; • inadvertently smeared various colors of frosting on a door jamb, in two drawers, on the floor, inside the refrigerator, on the backsplash and all over the countertop; • stained about 10 percent of my right hand with pink food coloring; and • suffered second-degree burns on two of my fingers.  That last one deserves elaboration. You see, I was wearing oven mitts on both hands, but it's really kind of hard to maneuver in those things, what with the decreased finger mobility and all, so I took one mitt off to open the oven door, and then I reached inside to pull out the rack on which the cakes were sitting. Unfortunately, the hand that grabbed the rack was the mitt-less one. Pain ensued.  Since I had no burn ointment or cold compresses lying around, I held a can of  urlLink Wild Cherry Pepsi  in my injured hand to relieve the throbbing, burning pain for the remainder of the chocolate-cake baking and buttercream-frosting making endeavor. Having a Pepsi in one hand slowed me down considerably, but the cake was eventually finished, and I hear it was delicious. I wouldn't know, personally, because I was too mad at it to eat it. Stupid cake.

      So let me get this straight: We have  urlLink pandas watching porn ,  urlLink orangutans taking paternity tests  and  urlLink rodents cheating on their mates . It's like  urlLink "Wild Kingdom"  meets  urlLink "Montel Williams"  up in here.  American society must be contagious or something.

      So the other day I was standing around at  urlLink McDonald's , waiting for  urlLink my order , when the greasy-haired manager boy leaned across the counter and said to me, "You work at  urlLink Supercuts , right?" So I was like, "Uh, no ..." because I don't, and then the acne-faced register boy interjected, in a "duh" sort of way, "She works at  urlLink Gottschalks ." To which I replied, "No, I don't work there either." And then they both felt stupid. It was pretty cool.

      Speaking of names (keep reading, you'll get there), Boise State University is changing the name of its Pavillion to  urlLink Taco Bell Arena.  Apparently, the  urlLink fast-food company  has agreed to pay the school $4 million. In chalupas! Ha!   So not only are the women of this country naming their children after pop stars and TV characters (seriously, keep reading), but now the universities of this country are naming their pavillions after corporate purveyors of Mexican food. This country's going to  urlLink hell in a handbasket .  Then again, $4 million is an awful lot of money. I can't say that I myself wouldn't be tempted by such an offer. In fact, now that I think about it, Taco Bell Janocko kinda has a nice ring to it, don't you think?  I wonder how much Taco Bell would have had to wave in Idaho's face to get them to rename the entire school. Or the entire state! (Cue fantasy sequence.)  Person #1: "Where did you say you moved here from?"  Person #2: "Taco Bell. You know, the state formerly known as Idaho."  Person #1: "Oh, right. So you made a run for the border? Ha, ha." Person #2:  (Punches Person #1 in the face.)   ¡Olé!

      So,  urlLink Madonna's changing her name . To Esther. Which is ugly, but also more appropriate. You know, because Madonna refers to a  urlLink virgin , while Esther means  urlLink star , and she's certainly made it clear that she's less the former than the latter.  You know what Christine means?  urlLink "Follower of Christ."  My mom got that all wrong, didn't she?   It's not really her fault, of course. She was, as always, just trying to be trendy. According to the  urlLink Social Security Administration , Christine was the 22nd most popular baby name in 1970s. In 2003, it ranked 332. I'm getting less popular every year. How much does that suck.  You know what else sucks? Crazy mothers who name their baby girls after celebrities. What's that about? The  urlLink top 1000 baby names list  is riddled with pop culture references.  Mostly, mothers pick famous singers as namesakes: •  urlLink Ashanti  was the 117th most popular name for baby girls in the United States in 2002. The year before, it was number 832. •  urlLink Aaliyah , which ranked 91 last year, was not in the top 1000 names until 1994, the year "Back and Forth" came out.  •  urlLink Mya  was 118 on the list last year; the name first appeared in the top 1000 in 1998, the year of "Ghetto Superstar." •  urlLink Alanis , which is a really ugly name if you think about it, ranked 735 last year, and first appeared on the top 1000 list in 1997, the year she was nominated for a Grammy.  Mothers also seem to prefer names used by fictional TV and film characters: •  urlLink Felicity  was 625 last year. The name appeared on the list in 1999, the year after the show debuted. •  urlLink Meadow  was number 769 last year, but was not on the list until 2001, two years after "The Sopranos" debuted. •  urlLink Trinity  has been rising in popularity since  urlLink "The Matrix"  came out in 1999. In 1998, it ranked 555; the next year it jumped to 216; in 2003, it ranked 57.  And once in a while, mothers are inspired by real life: •  urlLink Laci  ranked 443 last year; the name was 942 in 1992 but then fell off the list and didn't reappear until 2003.  But famous names don't always get more popular: •  urlLink Hillary  hovered in the 100s and 200s until 1994, when it fell to 556. The name continued its decline, falling off the top 1000 chart in 2002. •  urlLink Britney  had been declining in popularity until 1999, when it jumped to number 206 from 446. The name rose to 139 in 2000, but has been falling since she decided to go "bad" in 2001. Last year Britney ranked 325.   Now wasn't that interesting? It only took me about 15 hours to look it all up. See what I go through to entertain you guys?  Oh yeah, 378 baby girls born in the United States last year were named Princess. That's right.  Princess . People are such idiots.

      Did I mention my  urlLink new cookbooks  came? Yep. I even got to use one of them today — to kill a spider. It was a big ugly black one, and it was totally sprinting across my living room. Seriously, it was like the  urlLink Speedy Gonzales  of arachnids. So I had to act fast: I threw the biggest, heaviest cookbook at it. My neighbors better not complain about the "thud." Or else I'll aim the cookbook their way. That's gonna leave a mark.

      Milli got to see the  urlLink Beastie Boys   urlLink perform live  last week. But I'm not jealous, because I got to watch them perform on  urlLink MTV  just a few minutes ago. They were on some sort of special show commemorating the release of  urlLink "To the Five Boroughs."  The show's host, whom I've never seen on MTV before, was clearly stoked about it. He kept making little comments and puns related to Beastie Boys lyrics, but in a show-offy way, like he really thought he was being clever. At one point, he was asking them a question about something they said in an interview in 1989, and he added helpfully, "That was the  Paul's Boutique  era." As if they wouldn't know that. Dumbass.  Anyway, I don't really like  urlLink concerts . I mean, they are cool in theory — your favorite band, singing your favorite songs, right in front of you — but in reality they just don't do it for me. Part of it is the whole crowd thing. I just don't like being around thousands of screaming, singing, dancing, sweating, stinking strangers. Screaming, singing, dancing, sweating, stinking  friends  — that I can handle. But strangers — no thanks.   Also, I only want to hear the songs that I like. I'm impatient like that. I don't want to hear stuff off the first album that didn't sell very well because it sucked, or stuff off the current album that isn't on the radio because it sucks, or stuff off the next album that isn't out yet but probably sucks. But when you're at a concert, you can't stop them from playing that stuff. There's no "skip" button. You can't fast-forward. You just have to sit there and tune out, maybe go get some  urlLink nachos  or something, until they play a good song. And that's boring.  And songs never sound right when they're done live. Something's always off — the singer's voice isn't up to par, the music is changed up, the lyrics are ad-libbed, they throw in some kind of crappy medley, they "take it to the bridge." Why give up your hard-earned cash to hear a sucky version of your favorite song when you can put on your CD and hear it just the way you like it?  You know what the best part of a concert is? When it's over, and you go back to your car, and then you sit there for three hours surrounded by 50 million other cars trying to get out of the parking lot before you. Oh wait, that part sucks too.  I'm such a no-fun-nik.

      I know you've been eagerly awaiting this, so let me cut to the chase and ease your anticipation:  urlLink Strawberry Mike and Ikes are delicious .  In fact, all the new Mike and Ikes are delicious. As are the old Mike and Ikes. Mike and Ike = always delicious!  Fortunately, the  urlLink convenience store  at which I purchased the Mike and Ikes had both  urlLink the old boxes and the new bags  to choose from, so I bought both in order to conduct a Mike and Ike taste test.  Unfortunately, my palate is not as discriminating as one might have hoped, so I really couldn't taste much of a difference between the new Mike and Ikes and the old Mike and Ikes, although my sister says the new ones do indeed have  urlLink more fruit juice flavor . I don't know. They all tasted the same to me — delicious.  My sense of sight, however, is quite keen, so I am able to report that the new ones are, sadly, smaller than the old ones. Which doesn't make sense. I mean, here they are touting the new and improved Mike and Ikes, wanting us to taste the bigger Mike and Ike flavor but then giving us smaller Mike and Ike candies. They are essentially taunting us — "Isn't this new Mike and Ike candy so delicious? Too bad there's approximately a quarter of an inch less of it to savor! Ha ha ha! Now buy some more!" Those jerks.  On a semi-related note, throughout these last two posts I consistently mistyped "Mike" and "Ike" as " urlLink Nike " and " urlLink Ikea ." Corporate America would be so proud.

       urlLink Strawberry Mike and Ikes!  I'm really excited about this. Because, if you think about it, strawberry is really an underrepresented flavor in  urlLink candy land . Everything's always cherry this, cherry that.  urlLink Black Cherry ,  urlLink Wild Cherry ,  urlLink Very Cherry . I mean, cherry-flavored candy is tasty and all, but geez, enough already.   If it weren't for  urlLink Starburst , strawberry would be conspicuously absent from popular candy brands. Think about it — how many strawberry-flavored candies can you name? That's what I thought. And Starburst's strawberry is pretty weak, so it's not even a fair representation of strawberry candy's deliciousness.  You know what's good? Those  urlLink strawberry Sour Punch straws . Now that's some good strawberry candy. They remind me of  urlLink high school . You could buy them on campus. I ate them like every day. I remember one time I was eating them on the way to class and some random girl walked up to me and was like "Hey, can I have one?" and I was like "No." Heh.  Anyway, I'm stoked that they've added strawberry to Mike and Ikes. It's going to be so much better than  urlLink that StrawBana crap  they used to have. Remember that? Me neither. I do, however, remember Cherri and Bubb. But we haven't kept in touch.  So yeah, I can't wait to get me some of those new Mike and Ikes.  urlLink 7-Eleven , here I come!

      So, have you heard about how  urlLink just about every cosmetic, personal hygiene and skin-care product you've ever used is probably giving you cancer as we speak ?   Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration. The Environmental Working Group, who's behind the  urlLink report , says the public should be "concerned, not alarmed" about the findings. I don't know about you, but hearing that my Olay moisturizer, St. Ives body wash, Pantene shampoo and conditioner, Dial hand soap, ChapStick lip balm, Secret deodorant, Infusium 23 leave-in treatment, Vaseline lotion and Crest toothpaste contain harmful impurities, unstudied ingredients and possibly even  urlLink carcinogens  (coal tar?  what? ) has me concerned AND alarmed.  But being the skeptical girl I am, I wonder if this is really as bad as it sounds. I mean, these companies wouldn't poison their loyal customers; it's not good for the profit margin. Unless they are in cahoots with oncologists, or funeral homes. But that would be ridiculous. I think.   So I'm sure we'll soon be hearing from experts telling us not to worry about all that alpha hydroxy acid, lead acetate and formaldehyde in our personal-care products. In the meantime, however, I'll be hanging out with a  urlLink bar of Ivory  soap. It's 99 44/100 percent pure, just like I used to be, before the heroin.

      So, as part of my sporadic interest in health and fitness, I was perusing  urlLink exercise.about.com  when I came across  urlLink this Healthy Body Calculator thing  that was pretty cool, in a health-and-fitness type of way.  You fill in a bunch of boxes about your height (I'm 5'1"), weight (I don't have a scale, so I guessed 110), your activity level (10 hours of sleep and 14 hours of being sedentary ... that sounds bad, doesn't it?) and so on and so forth. Then it calculates how healthy you are. Turns out, I'm within the healthy body weight range, which makes sense, but since I have a small frame for my height, I should weigh closer to 100 pounds. I blame those delicious frosted cookies with sprinkles.   Oh, and my waist-to-hip ratio indicates that I'm an apple shape. Now, I must have measured something wrong, because I don't look like an apple to me. I'd say I more closely resemble one of those  urlLink long, lumpy squashes . Or a  urlLink zucchini . You know, if these health experts really want to convince people that they need to lose weight, they should probably change up the imagery a little for emphasis. You know, instead of saying you're shaped like healthful fruits and vegetables such as apples and pears, they should say you're shaped like a  urlLink Hostess Sno Ball , or perhaps a sack bulging with lard. (By the way, I would not recommend searching  urlLink Google images  for "lard".) I really think that if a doctor gravely informed me that I must lose weight because I am shaped like a family-sized bag of Lay's potato chips, I'd take his recommendation more seriously.  But anyhoo. This body calculator thing also told me that, if I am to lose a pound a week to reach my ideal weight, I should consume 1,310 calories a day. I wonder how many calories I usually eat. I would consider what I ate today to be healthier than usual, as I didn't eat any cheeseburgers, but since it's fresh in my mind, let's break it down anyway.   Breakfast  I didn't eat anything, because by the time I woke up, it was nearly lunchtime, and I figured I'd just wait it out. • Glass of Tropicana Fruit Medley juice: 140 calories   Lunch  I ate a salami sandwich. Salami, that's good for you, right? • French roll: 220 • 4 slices of salami: 90 • Slice of swiss cheese: 70 • Mustard: 0 • Little lunch-size bag of Ruffles: 160 • Water: 0 (I guess, the label doesn't say)   Snack  I love  Jamba Juice. • Strawberry Tsunami smoothie: 530   Dinner  I ate a salad that consisted entirely of that  urlLink lettuce that comes in those bags  and croutons. I used lettuce from two different kinds of lettuce mixes, so I can't figure out for the life of me how many calories that would be. I'll just make something up. • Lettuce: 35 • Three Cheese Italian dressing: 130 • Croutons: 45 • Half of french roll: 110 • I Can't Believe It's Not Butter: 40 • Cherry Pepsi: 160   Snack  • Grapes: 60 • Two delicious frosted cookies with sprinkles: 340 • Water: 0  So, that adds up to ... 2,130 calories? Holy shnikes! No wonder that health calculator thinks I look like an apple.   Ever-helpful, the calculator has suggested ways I could burn off some of those calories, but not all of them are feasible for a variety of important reasons: • Washing and waxing a car for 45 to 60 minutes (Car washing on apartment premises is a violation of my lease. That's also why there's a three-inch layer of dirt and dead bugs covering my car. Blame my landlord.) • Washing windows or floors for 45 to 60 minutes (I'm not Cinderella.) • Playing volleyball for 45 minutes (The potential for injury due to the ball repeatedly hitting my head is too great.) • Playing touch football for 30 to 45 minutes (I don't like to be touched.) • Gardening for 30 to 45 minutes (Both my plants are dead.)  • Wheeling oneself in a wheelchair for 30 to 40 minutes (I am able-bodied.) • Shooting baskets for 30 minutes (My basketball is covered with valuable autographs of Tribune employees.) • Fast social dancing for 30 minutes (No.) • Pushing a stroller 1.5 miles in 30 minutes (I ain't no babymama.) • Raking leaves for 30 minutes (I don't live in New England.) • Water aerobics for 30 minutes (I am not an old lady.) • Swimming laps for 20 minutes (Swimming makes me throw up.) • Wheelchair basketball for 20 minutes (Once again, not a gimp.) • Bicycling 4 miles in 15 minutes (My mom sold my bicycle like 15 years ago.) • Climbing stairs for 15 minutes (Where are there steps that take 15 minutes to climb? I'd have to go to like the Washington Monument or something. And that's too far away.) • Shoveling snow for 15 minutes (Oh wait, this one's totally feasible. My bad.)  So, that leaves walking and running as feasible ways I can burn calories. That sucks. I hate walking and running. If people were meant to walk and run, God wouldn't have invented cars, you know what I'm saying?  Damn those delicious frosted cookies with sprinkles.

      Have you ever considered endangering your life, as well as your beloved Honda Civic, just to teach a complete stranger a lesson?   Then you've never watched in your rear-view mirror as a fellow commuter passed you on the right shoulder while you drove in the slow lane of the freeway at 80 mph.   That's right: I was going EIGHTY miles per hour! In the SLOW lane! And Mr. Impatient Above-the-Law Arrogant Jerk passes me on the SHOULDER! In SANTA MARIA!   I was so shocked I didn't even think to catch up and shake my fist at him.  But as I watched him approach me at a speed that appeared to be in excess of Mach 7, I seriously considered drifting further to the right to see just how far off the road this guy was willing to drive. Could his sporty performance tires grip brush, rocks and dirt as well as they grip curvy paved highways? For a split second, I thought the risk of a totaled vehicle and personal injury and/or death was worth finding out. Of course, I didn't do it, and that's why I am alive today to tell you about it, and to wish I had been driving a semi.

      So, who was the biggest star at the  urlLink Democratic National Convention ? Did you just say  urlLink John Kerry ? Are you nuts? It was totally  urlLink Ben Affleck .  Apparently, he's been walking around Boston  urlLink shaking hands ,  urlLink making speeches , kissing babies, looking hot ... uh, that is, because it was crowded in that convention center, and stuffy, and you know, those wool suits don't breathe very well, and stuff.  So yeah. Ben likey the politicking. He's even  urlLink going on the road with Kerry and Edwards this weekend  to stump in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. "It's exciting. In some ways I'm better at this than acting. I mean, not that I think I'm bad at acting." Oh no, of course not. You're great at acting, Ben. How else do think  urlLink "Jersey Girl"  got that  urlLink Oscar  nomination? Clearly your 37 crying scenes had quite an impact on the Academy.  Make-believe Hollywood honors aside, I gotta say, my man John Kerry chose the wrong guy for his running mate. Ben Affleck would be so perfect as vice president. Think about it: He's everything that Kerry isn't. He's charming, he's funny, he's easy on the eyes — come on, do you really want to spend the next four years staring exclusively at that  urlLink Herman Munster  mug? Let me tell you, after that first State of the Union speech, your eyes will be sorely in need of some pleasant visual imagery, and John Edwards will not be able to help you there, because he looks like  urlLink John Ritter , but with plastic hair.  But even though Ben Affleck differs from Kerry, he is not so different as to be beyond the realm of political possibility. For example, Ben, like Kerry, is tall. And Ben, like Kerry, is rich. And Ben, like Kerry, is from Massachusetts. They're perfect for each other!  And how much more exciting would the vice presidential office be with Ben sitting in it? As it stands, the only time you hear about  urlLink Dick Cheney  is when he has a  urlLink heart attack  or when  urlLink Halliburton  breaks the law. Booorrriiing. But you know Ben would be out there livin' it up at Hollywood parties, high-rollin' at the casinos, humpin' around at the strip clubs. Now that's the kind of stuff I want to read about in the newspaper.  Another benefit to Ben Affleck being the Democrats' No. 2 man: Unprecendented voter turnout. You think  urlLink Bill Clinton got everyone all riled up ? The man looks like a squished-up loaf of  urlLink Wonder Bread . Get Ben Affleck in there, and you've got yourself a riot. Not only that, but the number of 18- to 24-year-old females registering to vote would shoot through the roof. Those  urlLink Rock the Vote  guys would be out of jobs for sure.  But perhaps the best thing about Ben Affleck as Kerry's running mate would be no more  urlLink photos like this . Get a room, guys. Sheesh.  See you at the polls!

      You know how they say, "With the good comes the bad"? Nothing illustrates this concept better than what has just happened to me.  You see, I came home from work tonight hungry, as per usual. So I looked around my apartment for something to eat, but because I don't cook or even go to the grocery store very often, the pickins' was slim. I was seriously considering eating some  urlLink leftover whipped cream frosting  when I remembered that I just bought these two giant boxes of  urlLink Apple Jacks  from  urlLink Target  the other day. This made me very happy, because Apple Jacks are delicious. I became even more happy when I checked the fridge and saw that the quart of  urlLink milk  in there doesn't expire until tomorrow. This clearly was meant to be.  So I ravenously ate two bowls of the self-described "crunchy sweetened three-grain cereal with apple and cinnamon."   Wait — so there really are apples in Apple Jacks? I thought it was just a clever name. You know, like how there's no pepper in  urlLink Dr Pepper , and no  urlLink icebergs  in iceberg lettuce. Because Apple Jacks certainly don't taste like apples. And you mean to tell me that not only is there grain in Apple Jacks, there are three different kinds of grain? I guess it's hard to see all this alleged grain what with that thick layer of frosted sugar coating those little Os.  But I digress.   So I ate two  urlLink bowls  of Apple Jacks. They were tasty, and they quelled my empty stomach's angry growls. This is the "good."  And now for the "bad": The roof of my mouth hurts like a mofo. Those Apple Jacks done kicked my  urlLink hard palate 's ass.  How can a cereal be so delicious yet so hurtful?

      Check out Inde as she's never been seen on the Internet before!     Inde, the cutest puppy ever, takes a breather after a long day of viciously attacking the rope toy, that pink pillow, and one of my dad's socks.      Jake, the "top dog" of the Janocko household, keeps an eye on the wiley puppy as she trots over to her next gnawing victim.   That puppy's got some teeth on her. We probably should have named her  urlLink Bitey .

      So, that  urlLink banana cake  I was talking about making? Tasty. Not only did I get mad compliments and a request for the recipe (that's for me to know and you to find out, sucka!), but my mom even declined my suggestion that she bring a piece to my  urlLink grandma , on account of the cake being "a precious commodity" and her being greedy. And the best part about this whole cake thing: I totally didn't burn it.   But I know you're still unconvinced. Because when you think "banana cake," it is likely that your next thought is "yuck." But trust me — it was delicious. Even ask my mom and dad. Because it's not like they'd say it was good just because they are my parents and they don't want to hurt my feelings because I spent all day making it and I might cry if they said it was gross ... would they?

      Guess what? I'm wearing an apron.  Yep. I'm sitting here at my computer, blogging away, inexplicably clad in an apron. Well, inexplicable to you. I know exactly why I'm wearing an apron. And it's a perfectly good reason, too.  You know how when you go shopping and you buy like a really cute shirt, and you are so excited about it that you put it on as soon as you get home so you can look at yourself in the mirror and prance around and generally just revel in its greatness? Well, I bought an apron, and I'm excited about it, so I put it on, and now I'm reveling.   Do I hear  urlLink snickers ?  Hey, it's not like I was walking through the mall and totally fell in love with some ruffled little smock emblazoned with apple pies and kittens that I saw in the window of  urlLink April Cornell . It's just that I've learned from  urlLink my previous baking escapades  that an apron would come in handy, so I bought one. And it's pretty cool, for an apron. It's from  urlLink Crate & Barrel . It's yellow, and nondescript, with pockets that I'm sure will be very helpful tomorrow when I'm baking a chocolate-glazed banana cake with french custard filling.  I'll keep the bananas in them.

      So, I went to  urlLink Taco Bell   urlLink again  tonight, and when I walked in the restaurant there wasn't anyone at the register, so a boy in the kitchen who saw me said "Hi" and started walking to the register. But then some other boy showed up, probably because he was supposed to be at the register but for whatever reason had abandoned his post. So the kitchen boy, upon seeing the register boy, turned around and retreated to the kitchen, and the register boy walked up to me and initiated the following conversation:  Register Boy (referring to Kitchen Boy): "Do you know that guy?" Me: "No, I think he just came up here to take my order." Register Boy (in an exaggerated whisper): "That's because you're pretty." Me: "Uh, can I get a chicken Burrito Supreme? To go?"

      I had  urlLink Taco Bell  for dinner tonight. I also had Taco Bell for dinner last night. And the night before. That's not normal, is it?   Before Sunday night, I probably hadn't eaten Taco Bell in like two years. At least. I go through phases with fast-food like that. I used to go to Taco Bell all the time when I was still in school. But more recently I've been  urlLink all up ons   urlLink Carl's Jr.  and  urlLink McDonald's . So much so that I get mad 10 percent discounts, fresh fries, bigger soda cups, and even coupons for free chicken sandwiches. Fast-food worker boys like me.   Yep, three days of chicken Burrito Supremes and nachos. Hey, speaking of nachos,  urlLink this guy sounds like fun , don't you think?

      So, two men get in a fight over a toilet at  urlLink Burger King . Now, I have to ask: How does this happen? How do you spend so much time in a public bathroom that fellow patrons get pissed off at you? And how do you have to go soooo bad that any delay spurs you to attack a fellow bathroom-user in a furious rage? I don't get it.  It makes me wonder how long that guy was in there for. Like, was it a reasonable amount of time and the mad guy was just being impatient? Or was the guy in there for, like, days. Because I could see how that would be frustrating. I mean, what does a person do in a public bathroom for that long? Peeing does not take but seconds, and as for good ole No. 2, that's an activity that should take place only in the privacy of your own bathroom. Seriously. How gross is it when you walk into a public bathroom and it reeks of poop? Not just poop, but  strange  poop. Is there anything grosser? I'm on the verge of a dry heave just thinking about it. I say, unless you brought a can of  urlLink Lysol  with you, hold it in. You can wait.   Hey, but how funny would it have been to watch those knuckleheads chase each other around the restaurant with their weapons of choice? "Feel the wrath of my tiny, dull-bladed pocket knife, you toilet hog!" " urlLink Step off , homey, or I'll bust you in the head with this straw dispenser!" Dumbasses.

      Did you hear about  urlLink the grandma who thwarted a robbery attempt by showing the perpetrator-to-be family photos, which put him to sleep, giving her a chance to call for help ?   Grandmas are cool.  I hung out with my grandma this weekend.  urlLink She's the funniest . She told me a story about how she brought home two pieces of cake from a barbecue, but because she's watching her weight she didn't want to eat the two pieces of cake, but she didn't want to waste them either, so she gave them to her  urlLink dog .   She also told me a story about how she went grocery shopping at  urlLink Albertsons  and, despite her best efforts, could not resist the newly installed  urlLink Krispy Kreme  display. After walking past it several times, she finally relented and bought a half-dozen doughnuts, reasoning that the last time (also the first time) she had Krispy Kreme doughnuts was last year, so these would be her doughnuts for this year. My uncle ate two of them. She ate the rest. Duchess didn't get any this time.  But the best story she told me was about the first time she met my grandpa. It was at a fiesta in their  town . She was invited to sing for everyone, and after her performance my grandpa went up to her and introduced himself. He told her he wanted to come visit her, and she got really embarrassed. So the next day, when she saw him walking up the street to her house, she got nervous and hid in a closet.  And you thought that only happened on sitcoms.

      Remember that  urlLink last batch of cupcakes  I made? I gave a dozen of them to my parents, but six more wouldn't fit on the plate, so I kept them. Today, two days later, I still had four left. Knowing that at this rate they'd grow penicillin before I ate them all, I brought them to work for my colleagues to gobble up. Good thing, too, because when I went home for dinner there was an army of  urlLink little black ants  crawling around my countertop — the same countertop on which the cupcakes sat just a few hours earlier.   Which makes me wonder whether the ants came into my apartment with the sole intention of eating my cupcakes. Like maybe they sent a scout ant over to my countertop earlier to see if there was anything good lying around, and the scout saw the festively decorated cupcakes and gleefully returned to ant headquarters to report the news and round up his hungry ant friends, but being as these ants are about three millimeters in length, the entire escapade took considerably longer than anticipated, and by the time they all arrived back at my countertop, there was nothing to be had except a discarded  urlLink cheese wrapper  and an empty  urlLink Dr Pepper can .   But then again, the ants' visit could have been pure happenstance. Maybe the ants were just making the rounds in the apartment complex, and they were like "You know, we haven't been in No. 3 since that short girl moved in. Let's check it out." So they excitedly got all their ant buddies together and made the trip to my countertop, where they looked around hopefully but, alas, found only a discarded cheese wrapper and an empty Dr Pepper can.  Either way, the little ants would have been terribly disappointed. But don't worry, they weren't disappointed for long, because then I came home and killed them all. Heh.

      It's 80 degrees in my apartment right now. By "right now" I mean "1:30 a.m." And by "80 degrees in my apartment" I mean "about 30 degrees warmer than it is outside." My pajamas are sweaty.  Luckily, I bought a  urlLink fan  from  urlLink Target , and I hauled it in here so my  urlLink computer  doesn't explode, or whatever terrible thing computers do when it gets hot. I know that something bad happens from my days spent inside the computer lab at  urlLink school , where the lab monitors were always writing the current inside temperature on the white board as a threat.  So with the fan on, taking the  urlLink wind chill factor  into consideration, it's probably a cool 77 in here. Stupid hot apartment.  But to be fair, it's not all my apartment's fault. You see, I cooked up a bunch of cupcakes this afternoon. I wanted to use up the frosting left over from the  urlLink last batch of cupcakes , which were burnt, just like the new batch. I'm thinking it's the oven, as opposed to human error, because I made  urlLink totally different batter  this time, and I pulled the cupcakes out a minute early, and they were still extremely well-done.   So I think the oven is just being a jerk. I don't know why, though. Maybe I'm overworking it. Maybe it's sick and tired of baking. Maybe, while it's preheating, it sits there watching me pour the batter into the pan and plots its revenge: "Yeah, I'll bake those cupcakes, all right ... until they BURN! Mua-ha-ha-ha!"  But, just like the previous charred batch, these cupcakes still taste delicious. And they are especially festive, thanks to a wide variety of multicolored sprinkles, including some lime green  urlLink Shrek  ones I just bought at  urlLink Vons . I love  urlLink sprinkles .  Anyways, had it not been for me having the oven on, it'd probably be not quite as  urlLink hot in herre . That'll teach me to bake in the summertime. Maybe.

      For more than 10 years now, I've excitedly sung the  urlLink lyrics to "Jump Around"  whenever the occasion calls for it. Like you know, when  urlLink the song comes on the radio , or when someone says something about jumping or  urlLink John McEnroe . On those occasions, I bust out the lyrics with pride, loudly reciting all the words until I get to a line I don't know, which is when I mumble some made-up gibberish that sounds like it could conceivably be the same words uttered by  urlLink Everlast , if Everlast was prone to speaking in tongues.  So I am happy to announce that, with the help of the Internet, I have finally deciphered one of the few "Jump Around" lyrics that have stumped me since eighth grade.  Here is the couplet as I've been singing it since 1992: "I got the skill, come get your fill cuz when I shoot (mumble mumble), I shoot to kill."  Here is the couplet as it is meant to be sung: "I got the skill, come get your fill cuz when I shoot the gift, I shoot to kill."  See, the reason I hadn't been able to figure out the lyrics all these years is that I had no idea what it meant to "shoot the gift." I would never have guessed that's what Everlast was saying because that phrase made no sense to me. Shoot the gift? Why would you shoot a gift? Wasn't it wrapped nicely enough for you? Did it contain a severed head? ("If it's a severed head, I'll be very upset." —  urlLink Wayne Campbell )  But thanks to  urlLink Urban Dictionary , I now know what it means to  urlLink "shoot the gift" . And I am finally able to recite the second verse in its entirety without mumbling.  So get out your seat and jump around!

      On Saturday, Robin and I made cupcakes. We burned them. But we cut the burnt parts off! Then we covered them in frosting and  urlLink sprinkles , and I brought them to work.  So what happens when you try to feed your co-workers burnt cupcakes? Why, they eat them, of course! And then they say really nice things about them, such as ...   • "It was one of the best cupcakes I've ever had."  • "Wow, these look really nice. You should enter the  urlLink county fair ! No, really, you could win some money!"  • "Were these for a photo shoot? ... Oh, I thought they were for a photo shoot or something because they're decorated so perfect. You almost don't want to eat them because they look so perfect ..."  • "They're not  that  burnt."  • "Are  urlLink these   urlLink salmon eggs ?"   • "They're delicious!"  See, you know we got the skills when even our burnt cupcakes taste good.

      You know what's a lot of fun?* Internet name generators. There's  urlLink tons of 'em  out there, just waiting for you to type in your real name and see what hilarious new moniker is spit out.

I mean, I hope you don't know all my other names, because if you do, that would mean you've been typing my name into random Internet name generators, and that's kinda stalker-ish, wouldn't you agree?  • My  urlLink porn name  is Ruby Wilde.  • My  urlLink gangsta name  is John Cougar Weasel Boy.  • My  urlLink Wu-Tang name  is Dependable Skeleton.  • My  urlLink pimp name  is Suede Chrissy Flex.  • My   urlLink Louis Farrakhan African name  is Huggy Bear.  • My  urlLink mob name  is The Umpire.  • My  urlLink prison bitch name  is Count Suckula.  • My  urlLink Chinese name  is Ji Shu-han.  • My  urlLink Transformer name  is Electrowide.  • My  urlLink Canadian hockey name  is Shane McJanockochuk.  • My  urlLink pro-wrestler name  is The Castaway Cowgirl.

      I just had the best drive home EVER.  Well, maybe the second best drive home ever. The first best drive home ever was probably the one where Shannyn insisted on learning all the words to " urlLink Big Pimpin' ," which required listening to each line of the song approximately 57 times in order to decipher it and then commit it to memory. Yeah, that was definitely the best.  But tonight's ride home was a close second. And what made this ride home so great that I couldn't wait to tell you about it? One word (two words? three letters? one acronym?): MTV.   You see, when I first switched the radio station to 95.7, I heard "Express Yourself" by N.W.A. Then "Humpty Dance" came on. Then "Jump Around." This is where I got really excited. Had I not been driving, I certainly would have been jumping. Then "Tennessee," Snoop's "What's My Name?" and "Rebirth of Slick" came on, and it occurred to me that something strange was going on here. I mean, how rare is it to hear so many great songs from back in the day all in a row? You'd think by this time the deejay would've stuck some  urlLink Usher  or  urlLink 50 Cent  in there somewhere. And that's another thing — no deejay. That's right, no annoying chit-chat between songs, just a few seconds of peaceful silence, kinda like on a CD.  Actually, EXACTLY like on a CD. But not just any CD. 95.7 was totally playing  urlLink "MTV The First 1000 Years: Hip Hop."   I've never listened to music in my car that had me as excited to be driving around as that MTV CD did. I seriously didn't want to turn the radio off. In fact, if it wasn't nearly 2 a.m., I'd probably be still circling the block rapping along with Ice Cube's "It Was A Good Day."   There's only one thing that could make this CD better:  urlLink "Ditty" . And possibly Jimmy Fallon.

      I was just browsing the latest  urlLink Williams-Sonoma  catalog when I came across the following sentence: "To ensure freshness, purchase mussels from a reputable fishmonger."   Fishmonger?  I've definitely heard the suffix "monger" before, but never used in such a serious, straightforward manner. Doesn't that just sound wrong?  So I looked it up, and it turns out that "monger" means  urlLink "Someone who purchases and maintains an inventory of goods to be sold."  So that sentence totally makes sense. But isn't that the most ridiculous way to refer to a fish-seller you've ever heard? Even "fish-seller" sounds less ridiculous.  You know, I think I'm going to start a business selling cookies. So I can be a cookiemonger!

      This afternoon at work I was thirsty, so I bought a 20 oz. Dr Pepper from the vending machine. I love  urlLink Dr Pepper  anyway, but featured on this particular bottle of Dr Pepper was  urlLink Spider-Man , whom I also love, which made me love this Dr Pepper even more. So there was a whole lotta lovin' going on in the break room. But this Dr Pepper bottle also featured something else: the words  urlLink "Win 1 of 10 Dodge Vipers!"  Now, this was exciting — just by drinking up some Dr Pepper and looking inside the bottle, I could get me a new car! How cool is that?  So I drank and I drank, until I could drink no more (because the bottle was empty). I then held the bottle up to the light and peered inside through the clear plastic window that was Spider-Man's eye. And there, printed on the inside of the label, were the last three words I wanted to see:  "Please try again."  They ALWAYS say "Please try again." Bottle caps, candy wrappers, game pieces of all kinds. Wherever there's a good prize to be won, there's also the phrase "Please try again."  It's really quite maddening.  But the thing is, when I see "Please try again," I can't help but feel hopeful. It's like the bottle is begging, pleading with me: "You have a shot; just one more soda, and that fabulous prize could be yours!" The bottle wouldn't mislead me into thinking I have a chance when there's actually no chance in hell, would it?  Would it?   So, I will try again, and again. I will meticulously feed handfuls of crumpled dollar bills into the vending machine slot, pour ounces upon ounces of this carbonated beverage down my throat, and repeatedly look into Spider-Man's eyes to determine whether this is the day I will be vindicated. All in hopes of winning a Dodge Viper.  And you know what? I don't even like  urlLink Dodge Vipers .  I do, however, like to watch  urlLink Spider-Man dance around like he's gay .

      You know how on  urlLink Yahoo! mail  they have those little ads running down the left-hand side that consist of a brief line of text accompanied by a little graphic icon to illustrate the ad's point?  Well, this ad left me a little confused:      What's that icon supposed to be telling me? "Check your credit for free, you wiener!" I hope that's not it. Because that's not very nice.  It could be some kind of hot-dog giveaway. Maybe there just wasn't enough room in the ad to describe it in full. "Check your credit, and receive this tasty-looking hot dog for free! (While supplies last.)"   Or maybe the hot dog is just supposed to be an attention-grabber. Like, the guy who designed the ad lives in India or somewhere, and when he got the assignment to create an icon he thought, "Now, what in the world would capture the attention of American email users? (Strokes his chin in thought.) A book? No ... A U.S. flag? Maybe ... Lindsay Lohan? Perhaps ... Wait! I got it! A HOT DOG!"  In which case, it totally worked.

      The reporter who wrote this story seems to think it is odd that this woman's pet rooster rode along underneath her car for 45 minutes. I would argue that what's odd is that this woman has a pet rooster.  Huh, maybe it's  urlLink not so odd  after all. They don't have dogs in the heartland or what?

      Today while driving home I noticed a  urlLink Saturn  in front of me that was decorated with a  urlLink K-Life  bumper sticker and a few of those  urlLink unauthorized decals showing Calvin praying in front of a cross .  Apparently to ensure that no one misses the point, the Saturn also featured a  urlLink vanity license plate  that said "H8 S8N."  ---------  "Error: Sorry. The plate you have chosen is not available."     Major bummer, dude.

      •  urlLink Chocolate mayonnaise cupcakes.  I know mayonnaise is mostly just eggs, and you put eggs in cupcakes anyway, but it just seems wrong, don't you think? •  urlLink Mounds chocolate cupcakes.  Have I ever told you how much I hate coconut? I really hate coconut. •  urlLink Low-carb cupcakes.  Almond flour? Splenda? Sugar-free pudding? What's the point? •  urlLink "Cookie Monster" cupcakes.  How you gonna make a red-nosed, green-furred, antennaed creature and pass him off as Cookie Monster? Lame. •  urlLink Spam cupcakes.  The people at Hormel are sick bastards. •  urlLink Tron cupcakes.  Whatever. •  urlLink Janet Jackson's breast cupcakes.  I'm sure they're very tasty and all, but ... no.

       Me:  "Hi, can I get a chicken Burrito Supreme and nachos?"  Taco Bell boy:  "Do I know you?"  Me:  "No."  Boy:  "Yeah, I know you from somewhere."  Me:  "Probably from here."  Boy:  "No ... do you go to  urlLink the high school ?"  Me:  "No."  Boy:  "How old are you?"  Me:  "26."  Boy:  "Oh, so you don't go to the high school. ... Do you have a sister?"  Me:  " urlLink Yes , but she's 24."  Boy:  "Oh. Do you have another sister?"  Me:  "No. You don't know me."  Boy:  "Yes, I do, I know you."  Me:  "You probably know me from here."  Boy:  "No, I've never seen you in here. I know you from somewhere else."  Me:  "No, you don't."  Boy:  "Yes, I do." We stare at each other.  Boy:  "What did you order?"  For the love of god. If I look familiar to you, it's because you work at Taco Bell, and I eat at Taco Bell. It's really that simple. Now stop messing around and give me my food. Shit.

      Looks like  urlLink pop culture as baby-name inspiration  isn't unique to the U.S. —  urlLink the U.K.'s all over it . I'm looking forward to the next generation of English monarchs being named Alfie, Poppy and Apple.

      When we were younger,  urlLink my sister  and I used to fight. A lot. And I don't mean we'd simply argue, or quarrel, or even bicker. I'm talking about fights. Rolling around on the floor, legs kicking, arms flailing. Hair pulling, arm twisting, punching and pinching. Screaming.  You know, those kind of fights.  Of course, we don't do that anymore, because we are adults, and also because she is now bigger than me. But back then I was the stronger one, so you know it was on.   Our fights erupted over all manner of things. Mainly, though, you could trace the disagreement back to my sister willfully refusing to do whatever it was that I had told her to do, even though I was older and bigger and, duh, smarter. And this would make me angry, because I was not only bossy but also short-tempered. And then I would yell at her, and she would ignore me, and I would yell at her some more, and then she'd throw a cup of  urlLink lemonade  or something at me, and then I would cry, because I was frustrated and also wet, and then — voila! — a wrestling match on the carpet.  We did have some standard fight-inducing scenarios. There the "No, YOU turn it off!" fight. We had this fight every night around 8 p.m., and it was made possible by the fact that we shared a bedroom. The moment my parents announced it was bedtime, the race to get under the covers was on. Regardless of who won, we'd both be lying in bed with the light on, insisting that it was the other one's responsibility to turn the light off. This would usually last until our mom yelled at us to be quiet, and, out of fear, one of us (usually me) would give in, get up, and flip the switch. (Our mom was extremely fearsome.)  Another common lead-in to blow-throwin' was the "No, YOU put it away!" fight, where an item (commonly a  urlLink cereal box  or a pitcher of  urlLink Kool-Aid ) would be sitting on the table, because both of us had just finished using it, and neither of us wanted to be the one to put it back. So one of us, most likely me, would tell the other one, most likely Dani, to put the item in question away. Dani would refuse, and tell me to do it myself. I would then say, "But you took it out, so you have to put it away!" To which Dani would reply, "But you were the last one to touch it!" And I would say, "You took it out, you put it away!" And she would say, "You were the last one to touch it!" And so on and so forth. This would go on for several minutes, until interruption came in the form of either parental intervention or fisticuffs.  But probably the most frequent fight we had was over the TV. You would think that, being so close in age, we'd want to watch the same TV shows. This was not always the case. For example, on weekday afternoons when I wanted to watch  urlLink "The Brady Bunch,"  she wanted to watch  urlLink "The Dukes of Hazzard."  Inevitably, we would resolve this by grappling on the floor in front of the television.  But really. "The Dukes of Hazzard"? What kind of little girl would rather watch two men jumping their car over culverts to the tune of banjos than a bunch of other little kids doing kid stuff, like going to school, playing on a see-saw, building a clubhouse (No girls allowed!), riding a bike into the garage door and breaking her glasses, wearing plaid bell-bottoms, and singing in a talent competition? An abnormal little girl, that's what kind.  So I never understood what Dani saw in Bo and Luke Duke. But I'm sure she'll be relieved to know that she's not missing much at this year's  urlLink Dukesfest , as  urlLink Bo and Luke apparently had prior engagements . (What, are they shooting a countrified version of  urlLink "I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!" )   urlLink Someday the mountain might get 'em ... but the law never will.
