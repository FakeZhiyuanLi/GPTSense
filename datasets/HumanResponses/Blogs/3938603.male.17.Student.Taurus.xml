         We had rolled down into the valley of Maple Springs, New York on Route 430 under a midday overcast that had spit drops of rain for most of the day -- the type of light drizzle that really could deprive the scenery of its slim satisfaction; sort of caving the sky upward and tunnelling towards the apex above. Parking, we got out onto the dampened, beat down hayfield that was Midway Park; its grass lot divided by a thin meshed steele fence that served, almost, as a frame for the structures we were walking out to.    From this point of view, the preoccupied hustle of children and their mundane parents suggested a cautious, unknown expectation for joy, like a crowd to an execution fatefully spread about the landscape waiting for the moment when the rusty nails and seams of the establishment split and collapsed. Nearly unfortunately, the park had died hard, last feeding its need for restoration in 1997, but its real age showed in its 106 year old ingenuity, as if to suggest that someday soon, it would fade to some better place, some amusement park arcadia.     Our purpose in itself was simple enough -- a bite to eat and a temporary glance at Lake Chautauqua; the proverbial meeting ground for the summer faithful of New York's southwest corner, somehow still with an engaging reflection rippling off the water surface, the lake still seemed battered and abused, perhaps begging for some sort of asylum.     The promotion of this old rustbucket was flattering but not entirely original, a plethora of public relation pertaining to the park's history and pasttime, as if to avoid the simple and perhaps more appropriate way to say: "We're old. Really, really old".    Maybe in truth, though, the carnivalistic atmosphere of the grounds was once a bustling place of business and entertainment, I for one remember the lasers show when I was younger, there, and sitting on the grass towards the edge of the road I had been amazed at the simplicity of a few colored lights moving around over the large slide to the back corner.     Exiting, I had mentioned that it seemed like this place was more an excuse than a reason -- as if to say that even as a child now I don't know that I could enjoy the decaying atmopshere and depressed age of the parents overwatching the chaos rumbling about. It was the type of joy I saw in the toddlers eyes who were there, banging away at the pinball machine or racing the line at "The Dragon", that made me question the pureness of the joy that I feel now, or that if it was just in this time that I realized Midway Park's slow and obvious death, and that maybe it was just absent to the eyes of the children who wanted, but moreso needed, that kind of fun...    Directing ourselves to a different type of experiment, we drove over to Audubon: A 600 acre festival of nothing but high grass, woods and rabbit droppings. It had seemed like one of the better places to be in the damp atmosphere; a quiet untapped resource of study that challenged you to dig deep and find cause.     I remember being there in 3rd grade and standing in a field of wild flowers and asking myself at the time what exactly the point was  and where I'd rather be , perhaps on a roller coaster or endulged in a game, but not in school, no, that would make do... But now the land seemed more worthy, and its creatures more interesting. How often do we, as people, stop and look at the things around us?    A slight hike down the trails had led us to a carved out, circular ridge that seemed to look down on the environment below. It was at that point that the one unwelcomed guest to this discovery had crawled up from the woodwork and began to knaw away at the back of my head. Flies, the size of golf balls, or bigger, maybe, batting the top and sides of my face like dull darts launching from a distance.     And like we were intruders, they chased us back to the parking lot batting the back of our heads aimlessly and pointlessly until the reviving sanctuary of pavement caused them to retreat in dismay. This was, in truth, the most disappointing of defeats. To be battered and sent backward by a few relatively small, meaningless objects thats sole point and purpose is to run straight into bright things.     I think I realized, heading back for the evening, that I sort of enjoyed the Audubon more than the cold steele of Midway Park; even though the place was meant for children in the first place, the food and the lake scenery was desirous only within itself, and taken on the only recognizable life of that trip -- a life that begged for it's own end. There was no life in the food, no life in the view, no life in the advertised history of the place that was no more than a scatter plot of machinery anymore.     I don't really think this is some sort of self serving maturation, but rather a testament to the idea that when one puts forth objectivity to the scenery around them, they enjoy it as much as the manufactured pleasure in amusement parks and fairs. I think at this point, I would rather be at a place full of flowers, and water, and life breathing along with me than bathing in concrete.     Maybe those environmentalists were on to something afterall.

         What are we? Life is the theme, with death rapped inside. But it's just the story we're playing out -- page by page -- and with the next anything can happen. That is a lateral thought. The world is just like dreams. Anything can happen, because you  truly  don't know from this moment to the next what life brings. Isn't that kind of scary? Think of your heart. A single organ with a single constant. Tick tock, tick tock. Does it stop tomorrow, twenty days, forty years? When is your ticket out? When do YOU leave us? And who exactly is "us", anyway? And does any of this matter?    Maybe we're just consumer organisms taking up space with fancy concepts and over important mechanisms leading ourselves towards the cultural climax offfffff: NOTHING. The end. Death, darkness, decay, what have you... I think that life comes with the idea of the fear of the end -- we are the first organisms on earth, perhaps, and perhaps not the last, that can justify the idea of our own end, that could reasonably see that there is a final death, and nothing after.     Does fear initiate hope, or the other way around? Do we only have faith because we have to? What kind of faith is that? Look: I want to believe in God, but why am I not open to these feelings that other people seem to have? Is this some sort of lottery? How is that fair?     Jamestown is a vaccuum. I guess every place is. You get around to living in a small place for too long, and you start to regret everything around it. Stuff isn't that simple around here anymore. Let me be brutally honest for a minute: There are things to do here. There are things that make life a little more enjoyable then it once was. There are people who are worth their merit. There are people worth what you have to exert to be around them. But life here is  not  fulfilling. It's the same corner of nowhere, every day. It's the same idea that we grasp nothing withstanding from our own little community. And then, to be a pessimist, there are plenty things wrong with this city. The meat and potato mentality. Old solutions to the same problems, that were spawned under this system in the first place. No one is thinking abstractly. Everything is uniform. This is a place full of history, full of light, and life. The mountains, the forests, the lakes, the hundreds of years of culturally significant people all somehow defined by a Lucy Desi Museum and a Fenton Estate. Two buildings. Two, God Damned buildings. Is that it folks? Is that what we are? Live and be done with it?     When I dream about moving away, about growing up I guess, I dream about having somewhere to go in my free time. I dream about tight bonds with friends. Some place full of colors, and lights, and mind exercizing experience. Where is my mind exercizing experience?     This area is a funny place. Chautauqua Institution's #1 on their program list is "Building a Global Future". How exactly do you build a  Global  future, when you need a gate pass to get in your establishment in the first place?! That's the type of thing you come to learn to expect around here. Complete, lack-of-sense BS. Stuff that makes you wonder who is doing the hard thinking around here. If you're really alone in your depth.     I met some nice, middle-aged, snobby rich Missourians this past weekend at my Uncle's 30th Anniversary Cookout. They are crazy rich, like, rich enough to buy half of this city type rich, and to be honest, I don't really like them either. Now I get the idea that they're obviously the extreme -- but I think I get the idea that both ends of the spectrum are kind of self centered, self serving sad excuses for existance.    I bring this up because I get the idea that people think that the exact opposite of what they see or what they are is a good thing. Look at the clothes we wear, the music we listen to,  the goals we strive to obtain.   They're all aimed toward making money, and becoming snobby, "better" people. But these people seem no better. In fact, they seem no more intelligent, no more diligent, and perhaps less so. They might just be a bigger waste of air, a bigger dumpster of life.  It doesn't surprise me to find that the character of average people is twice as good as that of anyone spectacular, no matter what kind of spectacular they are.      I'm starting to get the idea that a middle ground is not that hard of a thing to obtain. It's just not, it's just that a lot of people don't get the picture. Maybe a lot of people act out because of some situation in their life, I don't know, but I know that it shouldn't take as much effort as it does around here. Nothing should. And maybe that's the problem. Around here, you've got to try a little bit harder, and I don't necessarily appreciate the inconvenience.    But this raps back into my larger point -- maybe we aren't meant to enjoy anything. Have you ever tried to think about something entertaining that doesn't exist -- something filled with joy and excitement that no one knows about? I come up empty. I can't seem to beacon an idea. For people who committ suicide, maybe that's the answer. Maybe life was just not fulfilling enough in itself. Maybe no matter what happened, there was no amount of happiness that could fill them.    Think of it this way. Take a random thing and say that it would bring the most joy to you, in your life. Is that it? Is that the climax? Is there no greater level than that? Or perhaps the true question, is there no greater level in life? I try to comprehend something like that; try to recognize the immeasurable joy, and put some sort of label on its feeling. But I don't know that it can be done. I think it's just so of circular. If it exists, its rare, and unexplainable... maybe for a reason.     When you think about it, in general, things are better than they usually seem. There are always blue skies and smiles waiting around the corner, and even as we grow old we learn to recognize that life is sort of story to be enjoyed rather than a game to be played. But there is no definite answer to living -- in fact, only the understanding that there are too many questions. Sometimes, for some people, good feelings come by far too little, and for those lucky ones, they come by in a much greater frequency. Personally, I think that I will find a lot more joy elsewhere, but I've stopped banking on it.    I once had the idea that if I closed my eyes and saw a car, a girlfriend, and no drama, that I would be happy. But you can't bank on it. Because if it falls through; if something goes array, then so do you. Crutches are awful, awful things.    Sometimes, it's just better to learn how to enjoy the fall, then to try to hold yourself up.

        I stand in the heart of a portrait. This is my drug. This is the early spring of my reckoning; the life, the concept. The old house in the corner of my imagination that I've been seduced to explore, and each broken step to its balcony serving as a boundary; this, in my brain, is where I meet my fate. Sadly, this is a slight obstacle in my daily being, but for once I find resolve in progress, and keep pushing further, finding a way through this haunted, reoccuring wall.  And in the dying moments of my struggle, when I stop to collect my pulse and wholest being, I recognize the fatal flaw: That in life we are all imperfect, and I share this loose bond with everyone. So then, I must remind myself to keep striding against the ripping tide of life, and in failure, to try a different strategy, for the prize is always there -- always waiting, always lurking in the dark distance of my soul and always hoping I someday find my way ashore.  Somewhere in a field far off, there alone stands a wildflower, a courageous metaphor of blossoming light, that grows to the silent humming of Mozart in my thoughts. Slowly as I watch it blossom, it finds light, and nurturing and love. It finds the care of another, the perfect pattern of sunny days, and the end of hope, for all hope is truth.  And if this flower never exists, or in the least dies in the storm of my waining patience, I'll know that somewhere in that field of my conscience lied a beautiful seed, and that is worth the snapshot of my life.  All optimism is a product of waiting, and sometime it will eventually fade away. The reason for this , no matter its tear or joy, lies somewhere in the path before me.

        But in reality, I've got nothing. Just the horn in the distance, bouncing off the canvas blue, thats painted the ceiling of my mentality. You're riding the peaks and valley's of your timeline in fluid motion, kid, way to roll with the punches now. But as much as you're getting swung at I'd say you'd be good at dodgeball.  Or calypso dancing.  In all it's imperfection the everyday conquest is a chore unraveling in branches and chapters, and we're excited for the read; the next fix, but who overdoses with life? Shower in gold and knowledge and find your thoughts spinning negatively, while a man on the corner can whistle an upbeat tune. Like suicide's the only escape for the weary, admiration is the poison of choice for the soul.  Breathing's just a sliver of satisfaction, in this put-on world we digest. You're all made up and ready for your show, but you jest in your quiet, you're a bleeding heart like every fans you touch, and fame is just a word.  Live like a snowflake and be prepared to tango, it's a quick descent but you're dangerously unique. Wait until the dusk for a perfect sunshine, and pose for memory, this is as good as it gets.  And it sounds flimsy to say and all, but happiness is what you make it.

         Bending and breaking, enigmas all their own -- unfairly connected, conjoined at the bone. Rhapsody on the sidewalks in the summertime, like sweet concrete wildflowers, the smell of a new industrial day. Warm me. Soon, you lose your identity to the quiet darkness, and whatever future fortune is the future you believe, believe at least that the present is full of mystery.  And everyone's so lovely; everyone but you and I, staring at each other in the mirror naked in disguise. Like flesh to the wolves; flesh to ourselves. We live in divided little clutters, endorsing our own anatomy. Where the heart beats -- underneath the ribs, is where the home is. No where else. Find me a plot of land, or a roof, but only in the heart's steady repetition do I entirely trust.  And so then, do you have the potion that stirs the ideas they raised us on? Love and money, fortune and fame. When we're too ignorant to know the difference, is when the fairy tale is told. Sadly the reflection of this is in our eyes years later, as alone we sit, and perhaps completely surrounded by life and love, to realize that in the end, all the goals you set your soul forward to are as invisible as the soul itself.  Whoever works, works in unknown ways. But like the beat of a drum, we follow lifes rhythm, and blame it on the wind, and blame tragedy, and luck and tuck away shame. Who we are, as people, is the definition of what we are, as beings.  Like the completion of a sculpture, the earth has molded together so well. The sky and grass reflect each brilliance towards the middle; the stage, the spotlight. If you find yourself searching for answers -- looking for love or victory or assurance, know that it first must be from you. It always shows in your eyes. Like animals, it is the sense we see and fail to recognize except in the pit of our stomaches. Like a great intuition, it is the lost connection, the missing piece to who you are, to who I am. The ability to control this emotion, like we control everything we breath.  In the pitch black a star is welcome, because even the sky hates to be alone.  And if you asked me "Who are you," now, I don't think I'd have an answer...
