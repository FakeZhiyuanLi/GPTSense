      I found&nbsp; a couple of&nbsp;articles that are very insightful.&nbsp; I think any runner on the regime (moderate to beginner) can make use of this information.  The first&nbsp;article discusses proper running technique.&nbsp; There is a lot of technical terminology that may not make sense to everyone in both articles.&nbsp; Don't worry, as regime members we'll probably sound like the author soon.   urlLink Proper running   The second article has to do with knowing when buy a new pair of running shoes.&nbsp; Running mechanics and foot anatomy are apparently a&nbsp;big part of shoe wear.&nbsp; Print this out and read it on the plane or something.   urlLink Is it time?   &nbsp; Enjoy...

      I thought I could add a post that is informative rather than just posting training results.  It happens to be information that FX couldn't provide to those that follow his regime ;)  It has to do with that infamous word "Fartlek".&nbsp; The URL below is for an article that explains everything you ever wanted to know about Fartlek.   urlLink "Fartlek" explained &nbsp;  I'll keep digging for more informative articles that can help us out in our training.

      Today was Another run through Sindelfingen early in the morning.&nbsp; I found out that the hotel is only a mile away from downtown Sindelfingen (where all the restaurants are including Funzel).&nbsp; And it's very hard to get lost in this town because everything is so closely knit together and it's not very large.&nbsp; I kind of decided my route on the fly this morning (it's always fun to do that)  Results: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pace&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distance 1st Half:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9:31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 23:36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.47 mi 2nd Half&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~10:15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 19:36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~1.9 mi  You may be wondering why I have approximated my distance and pace today.&nbsp; Well, on the second half, my GPS batterry ran out.&nbsp; I was running at little less than a 10min/mile pace at the time.&nbsp; It seems like every morning there's a new adventure with the watch.&nbsp; I thought it was supposed to warn me beforehand about the fact that the batteries are low.&nbsp;   Who did I buy this watch from again?&nbsp; You can add this to the list of reasons why we need to take over the regime ;)  Honestly though, I think this is related to the rechargeable alkaline batteries that I'm using.&nbsp; It's a known fact that they have a tendency to lose power much faster than regular alkalines.

      Another run through the streets of Sindelfingen.&nbsp; Clear skies and the temperature was about 7 deg. Celsius (perfect for running).&nbsp; I ran through a portion of downtown Sindelfingen and then made a right turn which led to a large park.&nbsp; It seems like all roads lead back to the Marriott hotel somehow because no matter which way you turn, you end up back on Mahdentalstrasse (road where Marriott sits).  Results: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pace&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distance 1st Half&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:04&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17:30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.74 mi 2nd Half&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9:52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18:20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.86 mi  Total&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9:58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35:50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.59 mi  &nbsp; If you are wondering why I was almost an entire minute over on my second half, I discovered an interesting feature of the timex watch.&nbsp; I was close to the hotel and&nbsp;I saw that I&nbsp;was on minute 16:30&nbsp;on the second half, so I figured I needed one more minute and I'd be done.&nbsp; However, I kept running and expected the minute counter to change from 16 to 17 (as one would naturally do) but it set itself back to 16!&nbsp; I was not jetlagged, phased out, or on crack.&nbsp; Trust me, this happens and I thought it happened before, but this time I can confirm it did so.&nbsp;   Anyways, it's not a big deal.&nbsp; But just thought I'd let you guys know in case it happens and you start wondering if you are going crazy.

      Well, no training on Saturday and Sunday. I came home late afternoon on Saturday and was too tired for a run...was reading on the plane 10 hours straight and didn't get any sleep. Sunday was bad cause my right knee and ankle were swollen. It started to hurt already last week and I hope it's not because of my brandnew shoes.  Went running this morning though - with the help of 2 Advils I went for a 41 mins run at 5.30. I didn't follow today's training schedule and just went for a steady pace run: Distance 4.018 with a 9.56 pace.  Will go to the pharmacy today to get some medication, hope I can run tomorrow morning. Even simple walking hurts.  Take care guys - wherever you are keep running!  Katrin  PS: I didn't know how many hills we have in Herrenberg - holy cow!!

      As the quest for the US Half on 10/17&nbsp;continues... the training gets progressively harder.&nbsp; Whenever we think that the training and wake-up times stink, just think of the overall goal: being&nbsp;prepared to run 13.1 miles through SF.  Today, I ran through the streets of&nbsp;Sindelfingen.&nbsp; It wasn't bad at all, I went&nbsp;through residential areas and a park before I&nbsp;ended up back at the hotel.&nbsp;   Results:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pace&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distance 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9:33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10:02&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1.05 2f&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9:12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 3:01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.29&nbsp; 4f&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9:22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5:01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.53 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.30 6f&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9:25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5:01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.53  7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3:01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.29  T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9:39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34:06&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.53  &nbsp; P.S.&nbsp; Still looking out for a&nbsp;Bobcatt sighting.

      Again, another run in Tiergarten park.&nbsp; I started in the area near Postdamer Platz and went to the Bradenburg gate, then looped&nbsp;all the way around the other side of the park until I reached the statue of Victory (and then about another 30 mins of running after that).&nbsp; It was a most excellent run and the weather was great.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pace&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distance 1st Half&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.9mph&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:09&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 35:01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.45 mi 2nd Half&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.6mph&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;10:39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 35:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.28 mi   Total&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70:01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.73 mi    &nbsp; Now I need to think of how I'll get through the 75 min run this weekend.

      I was lucky enough to&nbsp;do my&nbsp;Saturday run&nbsp;at Tiergarten park in Berlin.&nbsp; It's a very large park in the center of Berlin that houses many museums and monuments.&nbsp; According to Kendra, there were tons of completely naked men sunbathing in the park on Friday.&nbsp; I was not fortunate enough to catch such a glimpse since it was a little chilly and cloudy at the time I ran.   Results for the day:   Speed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pace&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time  6.4 mph&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9:18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.22 mi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30:01   Ok, obviously I didn't follow the directions "35 min run with 4 strides at the end"... I guess I just assumed the regular 30 min run.&nbsp; Apparently with this training program it isn't safe to assume anymore.

      Alright, so I will be continuing training in the sand and surf next week.  But you all should continue your training where ever you may be, California, Germany, Japan, the North Pole, etc.  I will be posting my results when I get back, or if I can, while I am there, but I doubt I will have access.  Here is the training for Stage 4 regime:  TRAINING FOR SATURDAY, JULY 24TH: 35 minutes slow.  Do 4 strides at the end of the run (see below) TRAINING FOR SUNDAY, JULY 25TH: 70 minutes slow TRAINING FOR TUESDAY, JULY 27TH: 10 minutes slow, 3x5 minutes at about a 9:45 pace, with 3 min recoveries TRAINING FOR WEDNESDAY, JULY 28TH: 35 minutes slow TRAINING FOR THURSDAY, JULY 29TH: 45 minutes slow TRAINING FOR SATURDAY, JULY 31ST: 35 minutes slow.  Do 5 strides at the end of the run (see below) TRAINING FOR SUNDAY, AUGUST 1ST: 75 minutes slow  Strides are runs of about 100m.  Run at a brisk pace for about 100 meters and jog back to the start.  Repeat 4 times.  Try to keep your pace consistent on the strides.  Here is the training for the Evening Edition:  TRAINING FOR SATURDAY, JULY 24TH: 3 x 10 minutes run, 1 minute walk TRAINING FOR SUNDAY, JULY 25TH: 3 x 10 minutes run, 1 minute walk TRAINING FOR THE WEEK OF JULY 26TH: 4 Sessions of 13 minutes run, 1 minute walk, 14 minutes run, 1 min walk.  Spread the sessions from Tuesday to Sunday, August 1st.   Here is the training for Stage 1:  TRAINING FOR WEEK 1:  2 remaining Sessions of 7 x 2 minutes run, 2 minutes walk TRAINING FOR THE WEEK OF JULY 26TH: 4 Sessions of 5 x 4 minutes run, 2 minutes walk.  Spread the sessions from Tuesday to Sunday, August 1st.   Good luck everyone.  Try to stay healthy, especially the Stage 4 team.  We are starting to increase the mileage in a big way.  Remember to stretch and to take it easy on the slow days.  Ice your feet and legs if you must (if you are experiencing pain), after stretching.  Have fun and be safe.  Keep on running.

      No offense to you all, but I am sooooo looking forward to not running at 5 AM next week, when I don't have 7AM meetings to attend.  Our run was not bad this morning, and the sun managed to peek out at just about the time we finished today, so at least we didn't feel like we ran the whole thing before sunrise.  Results:  3.797 miles in 40:00.68 minutes for a pace of 10:32  I didn't do a breakdown, because I didn't hit the lap button on the watch.  In addition, we didn't really turn around like we normally do, as we completed that little loop of downtown Los Altos before turning back.  I will post training for the next week later today.  I will probably not be posting next week, unless I get a little time, but I will definitely post all my results when I get back.  Later everyone,  FX

      Ok, time to discuss training for Thursday.  We now have three groups that we track on here, two in Stage 1 of Training, with the main group in Stage 4 of training.     TRAINING FOR STAGE 4 REGIME, JULY 22ND: 40 minutes slow    TRAINING FOR EVENING EDITION, JULY 22ND: 3 x 10 minutes run, 1 minute walk    TRAINING FOR STAGE 1, WEEK 1, DAY 2: 7 x 2 minute run, 2 minute walk   Good luck everyone.  Stage 4 will be meeting in the courtyard at 5AM tomorrow.  For everyone else, I will expect to see a report on Friday.  Have a good run  FX

      Ok, the Ben Regime took it to Stanford's campus last night for our interval training.  The paths through the park there are nice, though the "off-road" portions definitely have too many pits to do it after dark if we decide to go that way again.  In terms of our intervals, we did pretty well on pace until the last two which is saying a lot because that was a long sustained amount of running prior to the last ones.  Nice work  Results:  5.497 miles in 58:16.90 for a 10:35 pace overall  Breakdown: (This gets tricky) 10 min slow:    10:13.15 minutes at 10:03 pace for 1.016 miles 1:30 fast:      1:30.99 minutes at 8:53 pace for 0.17 miles 1:00 recovery:  1:03.62 minutes at 10:35 pace for 0.10 miles (too fast) 2:30 fast:      2:31.51 minutes at 8:29 pace for 0.297 miles 2:00 recovery:  2:01.07 minutes at 11:36 pace for 0.173 miles 3:30 fast:      3:35.98 minutes at 8:42 pace for 0.413 miles 3:00 recovery:  3:01.50 minutes at 11:05 pace for 0.272 miles 5:30 fast:      5:31.34 minutes at 9:29 pace for 0.582 miles (awesome work!) 5:00 recovery:  5:01.22 minutes at 11:56 pace for 0.42 miles 3:30 fast:      3:31.38 minutes at 9:55 pace for 0.355 miles 3:00 recovery:  3:01.87 minutes at 12:21 pace for 0.245 miles 2:30 fast:      2:32.22 minutes at 10:22 pace for 0.244 miles 2:00 recovery:  2:06.91 minutes at 12:15 pace for 0.172 miles 1:30 fast:      1:31.50 minutes at 10:26 pace for 0.146 miles 1:00 recovery:  1:01.08 minutes at 12:48 pace for 0.079 miles 10 min slow:    10:01.52 minutes at 12:25 pace for 0.806 miles  Whew.  Ok, well, as you can see, the big slowdown was at the end, but that was mainly me and not Speedy or the Definitive who seem to have endless energy.  Nice work everyone.  See you all on Thursday morning for our next training.  Training schedule to be posted later today.  FX

      Ok everyone, I know that there will be a lot of late afternoon running tomorrow, but just in case, I thought I would post the training for tomorrow now so that no one can complain that they don't know what they are in for.   TRAINING FOR JULY 20TH: 10 minutes slow; Intervals of 1:30, 2:30, 3:30, 5:30, 3:30, 2:30, 1:30 fast with recoveries 20 seconds shorter than the effort; 10 minutes slow.    TRAINING FOR EVENING EDITION: 3 x 10 minutes slow, 1 min walk   Good luck everyone.  See you on the trails  FX

      Completed the final run of the week this morning bright and early.  Well, it wasn't quite bright out yet because the sun was still coming up as Speedy and I were running.  Needed to get in the run before a trip to Napa for the day.  Got to stock up on the wine for the beach in a week.  Results:  2.821 miles in 30:18 minutes.  Breakdown:  15:17 minutes at 10:53 pace for 1.40 miles 15:00 minutes at 10:35 pace for 1.42 miles  Slow but still in the right range for the slow pacing.  Later everyone,  FX

      Speedy and I took our training up to Golden Gate Park today to do our long run for the weekend.  It was definitely going to be an experience.  I had only been through the park once and that was on a bike, so I wasn't quite sure what the terrain was going to be but I figured we could handle whatever was thrown at us.  The schedule was for a 65 minute run and I was sure we weren't going to find the exit of the park before we turned around.  Results:  6.127 miles in 1 hour, 5:19 minutes.  Don't really have a breakdown today but I did calculate it out to a 10:39 pace for the whole thing.  Not a bad showing considering the long hills that we encountered through the course.  I was very happy with our time overall.  I definitely at the end had enough to go a little futher, though we did have a very slow portion about 2 miles into the race so that we could recover from one of the longest hills.  All in all very nice, and it was nice to get off of the streets of Los Altos for a day.  Still have our 30 minute run tomorrow and we will probably take that over to Stanford's campus, just to get a little change of scenery again before another tough week ahead.  Keep on running all,  FX

      Hey all, time for the training plan for the weekend. Two sets of training posted here. The first was agreed upon with Kelly for his definite training for the week. He promised to do at least his running on Friday and Sunday and maybe on Saturday too. We just have our normal schedule of Saturday and Sunday with one day being a long run.    TRAINING FOR JULY 17th: 30 minutes slow. TRAINING FOR JULY 18th: 65 minutes slow     TRAINING FOR EVENING EDITION: 2 sessions with 3 x 10 minute run, 1 min walk   Good luck on your runs. I know that Speedy and I will be running in Golden Gate Park on Saturday for the long run, and shifting the short run to Sunday. It should definitely be a treat.   Have fun and be safe   FX

      Well, we all managed to drag ourselves out of bed despite being out late last night, though not as late as I have been out on some other nights before runs.  Like I said this morning, I think I have to stick to my previous goal of not drinking alcohol the day before a run.  It just leaves me too beat up in the morning.  Results for the day:  Total of 3.851 miles in 40:03.69 minutes  Breakdown: 20:03.16 minutes at 10:42 pace for 1.872 miles 20:00.53 minutes at 10:06 pace for 1.978 miles  We had a big pick-up on the way back.  We normally average about 30 seconds faster but today got 36 seconds, which doesn't sound like much, but it was.  I am guessing we all finally got the sleep out of our legs by that point.  Good job everyone,  FX

      Ok, so none of us is going running in the grand canyon anytime soon, and none of us is going to be going 27 miles in 100 degree heat, but this story is still freaky.  Especially when you see what the running store was that the girl was sponsored by.  That is the one around the corner from my apartment and where The Definitive get his shirt for our 10K and where I get most of my running clothing.

      Hello all, time for our training post again.  Another light day tomorrow, in anticipation of our 65 minute run this weekend.   TRAINING FOR JULY 15TH: Run 40 minutes slow   See you in the morning.  The time is yet to be determined, but the Definitive has a 7:30 meeting so we have to make sure he has time to shower so he doesn't make the whole Data Integrity team keel over.  Later  FX

      We had a good run this morning despite the early time of 5:15AM.  It is always so nice to go running when the sun hasn't even thought about getting up yet.  The best quote from the day:    After running and stretching, Speedy asks "What time is it?"  My reply "Not even 6AM yet."  Yes, we are crazy, but you know you all love it.  Results:  Total of 2.886 miles in 30:05.43 minutes.  Breakdown: 15:04.13 minutes at 10:35 pace for 1.423 miles 15:01.30 minutes at 10:15 pace for 1.463 miles  Good work, see you tomorrow  FX

      We ran a total of 4.936 miles in 50:37.77 min for a 10:14 pace overall.  Not bad.  I know you all wanted to go faster, but I think that was good for today's training.  The breakdown was:  10:24.98 min at a 10:34 pace for .984 miles 15:10.16 min at a 10:30 pace for 1.443 miles 15:01.79 min at a 10:09 pace for 1.478 miles 10:00.84 min at a 9:43 pace for 1.029 miles  Good work.

      Ok, time to post the training schedule for tomorrow:   TRAINING FOR JULY 13TH: 10 minutes slow, 30 minutes fartlek, 10 minutes slow   You are probably asking how we will do the fartlek.  I figure we should just pick points to pick up the pace a little bit.  Of course, this being the Ben Regime, I will help to decide when those points should be :)  All in all it should be a good run.  I am suggesting 5:30 in the courtyard again.  See you then  FX

      Can you say hot?  Yes, it was hot and humid.  Probably close to 80 degrees and 80% humidity by race time at 9AM.  There went any hope I had of running for a personal record at the 5K distance.  The course was not flat as I had expected either.  It was definitely hilly, which is saying a lot to find a hilly course in Chicago.  Add to that, the race organizers put the 1 mile mark too early on the course.  As a result, I felt like I had slowed down so much during the 2nd mile that I was severely disappointed.  Imagine seeing the clock at the 1st mile say 8:20 (I was shocked), and then the clock at the 2nd mile say 18:20.  As you could guess I was disappointed.  Still, it was hot, and I am not even sure any of the clocks were correct except the one at the finish.  I finished in 30:19 which given the conditions and the hills, I was happy.  It was not the PR that I had hoped for, but given the humidity, it was definitely showing that I have improved in the last 6 months to be able to run that fast in temperatures about 40 degrees warmer and definitely a lot more humid than December.  It was cool meeting Chris Zorich and I got him to sign my race number.  All in all, pretty fun, but definitely my last race until the 10K in September that we have scheduled into our training.  Later all,  FX

      I will write about my race on Sunday later (just a note, it was hot), but I saw this link and I couldn't help but comment.  It is sad that the results of this past weekend are going to bring up more questions than they answer.  When you look at the results and you see Tim Montgomery and Marion Jones both knocked out of the Olympics by poor showings in the finals of their events at the trials, there can only be one question that keeps nagging in your mind.  "ARE THEY GUILTY??"  They purposely ignored the media's requests for interviews all weekend, even after Jones had a fast time in the semi-finals of the 100m.  So, any attempt by them to blame the media for their loss this weekend would be false.  The real questions should be: Were they using, and did they stop using because they knew the scrutiny at the trials would be high?  Did they stop using so that they would not fail some test at the trials after making it?  Had they been using all along and now we see that they weren't capable of the same performance on a level playing field?  Sadly, we might not ever know the truth, but here's to hoping that the athletes that did make the team this weekend bring home something to be proud of.   urlLink sacbee.com -- Trials -- Olympic ambitions race to reality as scandal gets muscled aside

      I figured I should look into some new shows since my Reeboks seem to be losing tread quickly.  I know I didn't gain any weight since I have had them, so it leads me to believe that the rubber they put into the soles isn't as good as what Asics used on my 1080s that have been retired to chilling shoe status.  I went to FleetFeet which was where I picked up The Definitive and my race packets for the 10K, because I had a coupon for $10 off and I had to get my packet for tomorrow's run there.   My thoughts:  #1:  Much bigger selection of shoes than the place around the corner from me, which I liked.    #2:  Much busier.  I had to pull a number and wait to be called for my shoe fitting.  Meanwhile, the place got packed.  I couldn't believe the number of people in there.  The guy helping the people next to me said this is the start of the busy period which goes this way until the marathon.  Note to self: Try not to need more shoes until October.  #3:  Awesome help.  The girl who helped me knew a lot.  They make you put on some shoes with absolutely no support in them so they can watch how your feet move.  Mine felt like every bit of stability in the show was gone.  As you could imagine, I need Stability shoes, which isn't a bad thing, and actually from what I understand, it is the most common type of shoe.  Plus it was what I had been wearing with both the Reeboks and Asics 1080s.  So, I must have tried on about 12 pairs of shoes, well, really 11 and a half.  It came down to the Asics 2090s, which are an upgraded version of my old Asics, and the Brooks Adrenaline, which I think is what the Definitive wears.  I wore the left shoe of the Asics almost the entire time and it felt awesome.  It made me remember why I like my old pair so much; they feel like you aren't wearing anything and yet help to stabilize your feet.  In the end, the Brooks shoes felt good, but after running in them a few time, I could really tell that they hugged my toes too much.  So, I got the Asics.  Now, you are probably still wondering about the half pair that I tried.  Pearl Izumi makes running shoes now, and let me tell you, they feel awesome.  If I thought the Asics felt amazing, this was like running on feathers.  BUT!! , the store couldn't find the second shoe in the pair.  Somehow, the only pair in my size had only 1 shoe in the box.  I would definitely have gotten both the Asics and the Pearl Izumi shoes.  So what did I do?  I went home and ordered them from the Pearl Izumi  urlLink website .  They cost the same as in the store, and I knew exactly what size I needed.  The shoe is called the Vital Plus and it has a seamless upper which is supposed to help prevent blisters.  They should be coming in the mail at some point.  Now I have two pairs of shoes that will need breaking in.  The good news is that with our increased mileage, having two pairs of shoes means that I can miss the busy season and still be able to train in my new ones after we finish the race.  Looks like I can get another gift certificate for Christmas at Fleet Feet, and I will know better what I want.  One more note before I close this off.  You all may want to look into getting socks made specifically for running.  Not only was I looked at funny in the store with my Hanes Cotton socks, the girl helping me did say that she made that mistake too when she did her first marathon.  She said that she thought she wouldn't need them, but her feet blistered bad.  On her advice, I bought two pairs which go with the one I already have and I ordered another with the shoes online.  The socks aren't too expensive, and I know that Speedy bought a 3-pack with her watch the other day.  Keep on Running :)  FX

      Here's an interesting article I came across.  It's a newsletter that I guess I was automatically signed up for after I ran the Trail Run in Muir Beach.  urlLink Heat and Humidity    And another good article on what a runner's diet should NOT be.  urlLink  Diet...NOT!    Active.com is a pretty good source for tips and advice on running.  It also has a pretty decent event calendar.  Check it out and enjoy...

      I hope everyone has a good weekend.  We have what will probably be our last light weekend of the training up until about a week before the race.   TRAINING SCHEDULE FOR JULY 10th: 30 min slow   TRAINING SCHEDULE FOR JULY 11th: 55 min slow   Try to keep the pace at about 10:30 which is right where we were at on Thursday.  Keep on running and remember to post your results here so that we can all see.

      We did a little better this morning at holding the pace back like I wanted to do.  It wasn't perfect, but you can't keep a reign on that Kashif character.  Our total mileage for the day was 3.809 miles in 40:03.63  This splits into a 10:46 pace for the first half where we covered 1.861 miles in 20:03 and a 10:16 pace for the second half where we covered 1.947 miles in 20:00.  This averages out amazingly enough to a 10:30 pace over that time.  We should still try to hold back a little more on the return trip even though it is downhill, but I think we are on track.  I will publish this weekend's schedule on Friday.  I will be going off the schedule myself as I will be participating in the CZF 5K run on Sunday, proudly wearing my Orange and Blue for the Bears.  Til Tomorrow...  FX

      Ok, here is the assigned training program run for July 8th.  As far as I know, at this point, we will be meeting at 5:30AM in the courtyard.   TRAINING FOR JULY 8th: 40 minutes slow   We should aim for an 11 min pace on the slow run.  I know we will end up faster, but I will try and get us to hold back. We need to recover from Tuesday's speed session.

       TODAY'S TRAINING: 10 min jog. 6x2 mins fast with 2 min jog recoveries. 10 min jog   Ok, so normally I will post the run the day before or two days before in the case of weekends.  In this case, obviously I can't do that.  Speedy and I ran the training for today for a total of 4.298 miles in 44:56.  Our 10 min opening was at a 10:38 pace which was a little fast.  We covered .972 miles and went a little long on it for 10:21.06.  The 6 intervals were run at paces of 9:25, 9:16, 9:06, 8:41, 9:06, 8:53.  The last 10 min was run at a 11:01 pace for almost exactly 10 minutes and covered .908 miles.  All in all a good run.  Besides Speedy's knee problems early, it was all good.

      Taking the name from Armando, the new Ben Regime lives on as the preferred running training program of PI.  We can use this to post our training schedule for the next day or week and track our progress and times.  Everyone who would like to become a member will have access to post to the blog and record their times and any thoughts they have on the current training program.  This way, we can all stay up to date, even when we are far away (Germany, Atlanta, Chicago, California).  Hope this meets everyone's expectations.  As we go forward, I am going to try and do some cool things to this blog, so stay tuned and keep on posting.

      I think the lack of sleep from vacation and Germany was catching up with me this week and that is what caused my illness.  In Germany, I was passing out for a couple of hours at a time on the weekend before I came back, just because I was exhausted.  This morning I woke up at 1 am and felt a lot better, and will be ready to resume my training this weekend.  Hopefully, this missed week now will not kill me for the race.  We still have 8 weeks of training left.  I only missed on 6 mile long run which, considering we ran 5.5 miles twice during the week in Germany, shouldn't kill me.  Everyone from Level 4 regime should also remember that we are supposed to run a 10K race the weekend of September 10th-11th.  I still haven't found any but one in Fresno, CA, which really doesn't help us.    Training for the weekend is as follows:  For kelly and twinsmom, you know what to do.  Keep up the good work and next good luck moving the next step next week.  For Level 4 Regime:  TRAINING FOR AUGUST 14TH:  10 min slow, 30 minutes fartlek   TRAINING FOR AUGUST 15TH:  7 miles slow   Good luck everyone, and speedy, stay on the bike for now.

      I am amazed too.  Didn't think I would even get this far.  This is the farthest I have ever, ever, come in any physical activity program in a really long time.  Especially one that is 4 times a week.  I have to admit I am still not really enjoying the actual run.  I do feel good afterwards and feel proud that I am still doing it but enjoying the actual run?  NO.  I do plan for it on the days I know I have to run but I do not look forward to it.  But that's ok.  I am still doing it and when I start to see more of the benefits in terms of physical appearance I will be more motivated.  I ran the three reps of 6 min run 1 min walk.  Before the 4th and final there was a minor disaster with some spilled drinks that I had to immediately stop for and cleanup since one of my twins had spilled buttermilk on the sofa.  Did not want that getting soaked in:-)  So used my one minute walk for that cleanup and got right back on the treadmill for the 4th and final rep.  Since I had kinda gone off the schedule I ran 8 minutes instead of 6 just to see if I could do it.  I did manage it(and why am I doing this again????)  So two more runs this week and I am ready for my week 4 schedule.   Hope all the rest start feeling better and get back to their runs:-)  Twinsmom.

      Training schedule:   5-6 Miles Steady      Man was it hard to get up this morning.  I ran through Los Altos in the early early AM.  My mp3 player battery died right about 1M from home.  Why are rechargeable batteries such crap!??  FX and Speedy, hurry up and get better so I won't have to listen to my mp3 player every morning and can get back to yapping away ;)   Anyways, results are as follows:              Pace      Distance      Time 1st      10:06     2.54 mi       25:37 2nd      9:26      2.47 mi       23:17 Total   9:46      5.00 mi      48:54

      Training for Wednesday August 11th:   4.5 MILES SLOW      The training actually says to do between 4 and 5 miles today, but I'm going to stick to our policy of choosing the middle path.   The Run: It was a lonely run through Los Altos.  With FX ailing and Speedy injured, there was nobody that The Definitive could yap at.  Well, the mp3 player kept things from getting downright boring.  But I managed to run 4.5 miles at almost exactly a 10min/mile pace.  I think that is too fast but when the cat's away, the mice will play ;)  Results:                        Pace     Distance     Time 1st      10:00    2.23 mi      22:18 2nd      9:53     2.27 mi      22:29  total    9:56      4.50 mi     44:46

      I know that you all have been making great progress and I am proud of you.  Last week I did run on Tuesday and Thursday.  Saturday and Sunday were wiped out by the cutover weekend long hours and no sleep.  So instead of using that as an excuse to completely drop out I have started week 2 again this week..  Ran on Monday August 2nd and Wednesday August 4th.  Now that I have started taking the time to stretch before hand and have new shoes AND slowed down my pace a notch I am able to get through my 4 run 2 walk times 5 without aches or pains at the end of it.  Will continue this two more times this week and move to week 3 schedule next week.  Hope that is acceptable to Ben:-).  I see that you posted my week 3 schedule already.  So atleast I know what to do next week.  Take Care guys and thanks for all your support.

      Ok, so I forgot to post our training yesterday, but the Level 1 groups both know what they should be doing from my post on Monday.  For the Level 4 group, our training was:   TRAINING FOR AUGUST 5TH: 5.5 mile training run   The Definitive and I ran in the park again this morning after a tour of the town.  It was a perfect day to run.  Just a shade under 60 degrees, the sun was just coming up (for some reason, the sun stays out really long in Germany), in short, perfect.  Results: 5.507 miles in 57:03.71 minutes Breakdown: Trip through town and out into the park: 33:22.03 minutes at 10:23 pace for 3.213 miles. Trip back to hotel: 23:41.68 minutes at 10:19 pace for 2.294 miles.  Hope everyone is keeping up.  I heard from Livia this morning that you all are bragging about the group and now she wants to join.  Have a good day and some good runs.  FX

      the Definitive and I ran out into a Sindelfingen park this morning after making a quick tour of the downtown (and I mean downtown very losely as there really isn't much outside of the town).  The park seemed to stretch forever and we had to turn around to avoid not being too far from the hotel that we wouldn't get back in time to catch our carpool to work.  Results: 5.316 miles in 51:48.63 minutes  Breakdown: 1.5 mile jog: 14:04.65 minutes at 9:09 pace for 1.536 miles (too fast, grrr, but I was too excited to be back running again to slow Kashif). 400m interval (~.25 mile): 2:33.22 at 9:44 pace for .262 miles (big hill) 2 minute recovery: 2:00.77 minutes at 9:51 pace for .202 miles (hill was gone) 400m interval: 2:17.33 minutes at 8:49 pace for .259 miles 2 minute recovery: 2:10.54 minutes at 10:52 pace for .200 miles 400m interval: 2:10.34 minutes at 9:20 pace for .232 miles (forgot to look at the start distance) 2 minute recovery: 2:01.81 minutes at 11:07 pace for .182 miles 400m interval: 2:12.59 minutes at 8:42 pace for .253 miles 2 minute recovery: 2:02.47 minutes at 10:35 pace for .192 miles 400m intercal: 2:10.25 minutes at 8:28 pace for .256 miles (we really found our form well on the last two intervals. 2 minute recovery: 2:19.69 minutes at 10:36 pace for .219 miles 1.5 mile jog: 15:44.97 minutes at 10:22 pace for 1.519 miles  One other note.  I got a handicapped room at the hotel.  It is nice to have the bigger bathroom, but the shower is an issue.  The shower was already hard enough to stand in when I was here the last time.  My head almost hits the ceiling.  In the handicapped shower there is a bar suspended from the already low ceiling with 2 hooks on it which I am guessing is for when you need to keep a casted leg elevated in a bath.  It was not fun trying to avoid.  Keep on running.  Can't wait to see everyone's reports.  FX

      Alright, there will be no uprisings, as I have returned from my long vacation.  And I come bearing results and more training for you all.  First the results.  It seems that you all were not the only ones with GPS issues.  I decided to replace the batteries in mine on Saturday.  The only problem this caused was that the receiver didn't synch up correctly with the satellites by the time i began my run.  Results for Saturday:  Run in Philadelphia, along Kelly Drive.  3.8 miles in 36:35.9 minutes.  The distance is estimated based on markers along the path since I have the lack of information from my GPS system.  It seemed like I went that far, but I didn't think I was running that fast.  Results for Sunday:  I put the waterproof quality of the GPS to the test.  It started to rain early in the morning, but I was not about to lose my training day to a light drizzle.  Of courses, it started as a light drizzle.  It didn't stay that way.  By the time I made it to the other end of the island, the wind was blowing harder, the rain was coming down in big drops, and I was getting strange looks from the people who were actually awake to see me at that time of the morning.  The turnaround made it even worse as the wind was pushing the rain directly into my face.  It totally slowed me down, but not more than a 40 second pace loss.  Total for the run: 6.483 miles in 1:10:01.  Results for Tuesday:  The rain let up, but there was still clouds in the air and it made it very humid and oppressive on the run.  Went out too fast again.  It is tough running there, because it is so nice, you totally forget to worry about the pacing.  Total for the run: 3.469 miles in 34:13.95 minutes  Breakdown: 10 minutes slow: 9:52 pace for 10:02.21 minutes for 1.17 miles 5 minutes brisk: 9:23 pace for 5:03.82 minutes for .539 miles 3 minute recovery: 10:23 pace for 3:02.98 minutes for .293 miles 5 minutes brisk: 9:24 pace for 5:00.94 minutes for .532 miles 3 minute recovery: 10:46 pace for 3:02.98 minutes for .281 miles 5 minutes brisk: 9:34 pace for 5:00.67 minutes for .523 miles 3 minutes recovery: 10:44 pace for 3:01.24 minutes for .281 miles  Wednesday's scheduled run was wiped out by rain.  It poured all day long and soaked the island.  The main street through town flooded for about 5 blocks starting 10 blocks away from the house.  Couldn't even go outside, not after my experience on Sunday.  Thursday:  Beautiful day with bright sunshine.  If only it hadn't been so hot.  I went out way too fast again and ended up trying to get as good a 5K time as I could when I realized it.  I ended with just a recovery jog back to the house.  The total for the day: 4.040 miles in 41:19.44 minutes.  Saturday was wiped out by lots of partying on Friday night.  Sunday was once again washed out by rain although I had the best intentions of going out that day.  I just couldn't slog another 75 minutes in the rain.  I fully intend on keeping my training up this week in Germany though.  We have moved into the official Half Training at this point.  It is all downhill from here.   TRAINING FOR LEVEL 4 REGIME FOR AUGUST 3RD: 1.5 mile jog, 5x400 meter intervals (shoot for a 2:05 pace for 1/4 mile) with 2 minutes recoveries. 1.5 mile jog.   I am guessing that Kelly completed his training for last week:  WEEKLY TRAINING FOR EVENING EDITION: 4 sessions of 15 minute run, 1 minute walk, 16 minute run, 1 minute walk.   And twinsmom also:  WEEKLY TRAINING FOR LEVEL 1, WEEK 3: 4 sessions of 4 x 6 minute run, 2 minute walk.   Stay Healthy All  FX

      I ran the 75 min run on Monday because it was too nice of a day on Sunday. I had to get out and walk instead of run. And if I'm going to make myself run out of energy, I might as well do it on a workday.  I ran up the hill up the street perpendicular from Mahdentalstrasse to downtown Sindelfingen, did a small loop within downtown, and then made my way to the park (with the two ponds and the dirt/gravel path). Came back down the park, and then finally made my way down to the road that leads to the Marriott. All that is a little less than a 40 min run. So I did this path exactly twice. My mp3 battery ran out this time about 10min from the end. I was praying for it to not die earlier, the run would have been really boring without music.  Results:  Pace Distance Time Lap1 9:57 3.91 mi 38:54 Lap2 9:58 3.81 mi 38:00  Total 9:57 7.72 mi 1:16:54

      The Definitive and I went for a nice run on Saturday morning. We met at the office and then went for a 15 mins drive towards Herrenberg. There is a nice and huge forest called Schoenbuch.  Although it was early for a Saturday (like 9.30am) there were lots of people - most of them probably visiting the cementary in the forest. Anyway, we started on a nice trail which took us downhill. We passed a game reserve with some deers in there. It was nice and warm and the Definitive entertained me as usual with weird stories. We kept running but didn't really realize how far and steep downhill we went until we turned and went back :-( We turned after 32 mins at pace of 8.56 and started running uphill. On the way up we had to stop after 15 mins and had to walk. We are just not made for a 30 mins uphill run yet. We were well prepared for everything - people told me that there are wild boars in this forest and under certain circumstances they might charge people. Well, fortunately, the Definitive knows the wild boar language and so I felt kind of save. I knew he faced and survived wild and super aggressive elks in the Yellowstone so what is a wild boar compared to these huuuuuuuuge elks??? Right, nothing. On the way up we somehow got lost and tried different trails to get back to the car. It took us a while to find the right path but at the end we made it savely back to the car. We even met a wild fox...well, unfortunately I couldn't prove that I know the fox language cause that thing was like 50 meters (150 feet) away from us and cut off when he saw us.  So, here are the final results:  L1 6.7 mph     3.649 miles       8.56 pace   32:36 mins L2 4.2 mph     3.134 miles      14.11 pace  44:28 mins  Although we walked the hills we still finished after 6.783 miles with a pace of 11.21. We ran at the very end (after we stopped the time) and ran another kilometer.  All in all a very nice run...warm weather, fresh air, wild life and drinks with oxygen in it. Only bummer is that I had to put ice on my foot for the rest of the day. It was swollen again and I could hardly walk :-(((. No run therefore on Sunday. Will try to train on Monday morning.  Good night guys...I hope you had some nice runs too and made progress! Speedy
