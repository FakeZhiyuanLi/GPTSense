      This is my eleventh blog post.  I had a very good day.  The day included eating, reading, watching TV, etc.  Also J.K Rowling lady announced the title of the sixth Harry Potter book today!  It's going to be called Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.  This is awesome news.  I'm a pretty big fan of the series.    I liked the fifth book.  It was great!  Harry was starting to get bitchy at everyone!  His friends, godfathers...anyone really.  He was just so uptight and cranky.  It was like he was taking female hormones or something.  Best Harry book so far.  Hopefully the sixth book will continue with the Harry being a little bitch trend.  I predict that by book seven, Harry will be a miserable hermit living in the forbidden forest writing crazy rants and mailing them to people.  Like Dumbledore or Hermonie.  Maybe Ron.  But the movies suck big time.  They make me fall asleep.    A movie that won't make me fall asleep is Fahrenheit 9/11.  I haven't seen it yet but does it ever look great!  I'll probably see it in a couple days.  If it's playing in my area.  I'm not even sure if it is.  I've been reading Michael Moore's book "Dude, Where's My Country?" And It's ok.  Not great.  It's a little boring.  But other than that, it's just great!

      This is my tenth blog post.  I had a very good day!  I cleaned my room and found a lot fo things that I thought I had lost. One of the things was some glue.  Luckly, the cap was still on tight, and the glue still useable.  I put it away for later use.  After cleaning my room, I didn't do anything.  Then I watched a movie.  The first Godfather movie.  It sucked.  Just kidding!  It was awesome.

      This is my ninth blog post.  I got up very early today. I made myself cereal.  And went back to sleep.  After getting up later in the day, I ate some other things.  And read a book.  Then I did various things.  I had a good day.

      This is my seventh blog post.  I had a fantastic day!  I did a few things.  There were a little bit important.  And I also did other things.  http://www.local6.com/entertainment/3447172/detail.html  Also, Mary-Kate Olsen has an eating disorder and is in the crazy hospital for it.  I think it's kind of funny only because she sucks.

      This is my fifth Blog post.  I had a very nice birthday.  I recieved many things that I wanted.  All of them very nice.  I won't list them all as I am a very busy person.  I'll just list my most favorite gift.  My best gift was the Game Boy Advance SP.  It's a blue one.  It looks nice, and is nice.  So far, being 16 isn't a whole lot different than it is to be 15.  I guess I have to wait a couple of months.  Or something.  Since I'm not as busy as I thought I would be earlier, I'll type my second favorite gift.  It's the Gillette M^3 Power.  It's a razor thst vibrates.  It's awesome!  I'm also still not busy so my third favorite gift is some DVDs. I have Pirates of the Caribbean, Forrest Gump, and Bob Dylan: Don't look Back.  I like them all equally.  My fourth favorite gift is this machine thta makes shredded ice and it comes with this juice that you put on the shredded ice to give it flavor. I think they call them "snow-cones."  My fifth favorite gift is a Playstation 2 game which is Lord Of the Rings: The Return of The King.  My Sixth favorite gift is Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut.  It's a book.  That's pretty much what I got.  And it's good.

      This is my fourth Blog post.  Today was good.  I didn't do a whole lot.  That's good.  I watched some pretty bad TV.  There wasn't any good TV today.  What I also did was play video games.    Tomorrow is my birthday.  I am pleased.  I will get gifts, etc.  It will be a fun day.

      This is my third blog post.  I woke up early into the day.  This was odd because I usualy sleep late into the day.  I had a breakfast of French Toast.  French Toast is when you put the egg stuff on the bread, and then cook it on the stove.  That is what makes it good.    After eating the French Toast and all that, I went for a swim in my pool.  Only I don't have a pool so I used my hot tub.  This was just as good, and plus I had jets.  Lots of them.  So it's even better than a pool except that you can't swim in it. Kind of.  I also played video games on my Playstation 2.  Not Playstation 1, but Playstation 2.  I can hardly tell the difference.  If Sony spray painted all of the playstation 1s black, it would be just like a playstation 2.  Maybe they did.  I just don't get why they're so expensive.  Hell, I could probably build one myself. It wouldn't be that hard.  I could just wire a bunch of radios and CD players together and BAM--A playstation 2!  Those Sony suckers are seriously fucked up in the head if they think I'm going to buy their little Playstation 3.  Fuck that.  I'm going to build one.  I'll just use my old playstation 2 and spraypaint it whatever the next color will be.  And maybe add a few radios.  My birthday is on June 20th.  I'll be 16 years old.  I think 16 is a fantastic age!  Much better than 15.

      This is my second blog post.  I had a fantastic day! It was fun and productive.  I did many things, I slept very late into the day.  After waking up, I took a shower. After doing that I ate some cereal and watched TV.  There wasn't anything good on though.  Sometimes there's never anything good on the TV.  I put the blame on those damn reality shows.    I also had a good amount of fun on the internet.    Summer is the best time of the year.  With all of this free time, I can do various things in a day.  This leads to a more productive life.  Which is good for various reasons.  But sometimes I forget to brush my teeth everyday.

      This is my first blog post.  I like blogs.  They're a whole lot of fun!  So this blog will be no exception! Hahahaha!     I'm currently on summer vacation.  This a great for various reasons.  The reasons are that I can sleep in later, watch more TV, Spend more time on the internet, and sleep more.  So far I've accomplished all of the previously mentioned shit.    Today was pretty awesome.  A lot of great things happened! I'll put them in a list:  1.  http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/16/911.commission/         The 9/11 commission found that there is no "No credible evidence" of the link between Iraq and al Qaeda.  This was one of the reasons we want to war with Iraq.  The other reason was the WMDs. And they haven't been found and probably never will be found, as they don't really exist.  So we basically went to war for no good reason.    On Monday Cheney said this:   "He [Saddam Hussein] had long established ties with al Qaida." -Dick Cheney = liar.  Cheney didn't even back this up with any evidence.  What sucks is that Bush is still going to get elected.  :(  2. http://www.degrassi.tv/index.jsp    I watched some great TV today.  There's this cool show called "Degrassi".  It's about these Canadian teens in Canada.  The show's one of those drama type shows where everyone is always messing up.  Sometimes they cry about it and/or get killed.  It's really great and I recommend it to anyone! It's on The N.  I think you have to have satellite or digital cable to get that channel.    3. http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/006052569X/qid=1087440087/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-7492914-0123826?v=glance&s=books    I've also read a good deal of this book I got called Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades.  It deals with the life of Bob Dylan.  For an asshole, he's had a really interesting life.  Someone should shoot him.  Or, if not shoot him, then maybe just make sure he never sings again.  I saw him a couple of nights ago in concert.  Man, what a loser!  Talk about a raspy voice...  4.  I slept a lot today.  I like that.    Summer vacation is awesome.  If I were always on summer vacation, I would be able to get a shit load of stuff done! I bet I could read at least twenty books, watch 1,000,000,000 hours of TV, and Sleep for 1,000,000,000 hours!    I would also like to stat how much I hate this fellow blogger: http://misterfahrenheit.blogspot.com    While he did spell the name correctly, he failed to mention where he got the name.  The name was created by Freddie Mercury of Queen, and is featured in their song "Don't Stop Me Now." Also, he hasn't posted a blog since May 31st.  That sucks because I wanted that name and now I have to use Misterfahrenheit2.  Which is very lame.  He is a liar.

      This is my fifteenth blog post.     I had a very productive day.     I was reading the newspaper, and I saw an ad to apply in person at the Kyoto Japanese stake house. Needless to say, I headed over to apply. In person. Just like they asked. I applied for the position of "bus boy". I think it went over very well, and they told me they would call.     They won't.  I'm sure it'll just be a repeat of the Best Buy incident.  But I could get hired.  I sure hope they hire me.       After doing that load of shit, I went to Blockbuster to rent the following movies:     Something's Gotta Give -- It was ok. I don't have much feelings for it. The story was kind of lame. I give it 3 out of 7 stars.     Along came Polly -- It was alright, I guess.  If you like that sort of thing.  4 out of 7 stars.     Masked and anonymous -- This movie rocked. Best movie I've seen in awhile. It was partly written by Bob Dylan and Larry Charles. The movie is just so fucking great. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to see a fantastic movie. 7 out of 7 stars.

      This is my fourteenth blog post.      On the 15th my family and I left Virginia to travel to Wildwood, New Jersey. It was a long drive in the car, and I slept for most of the trip. When I was little, I spent many vacation with my family at the Jersey Shore. It's a very nice small town with fantastic sea food restaurants  and such. When we arrived, I found that little has changed. Some newer hotels have been put up, and a couple more condos, etc. But still pretty much the same.     Many of the hotels have a very 60s feel to it. With the colors and such, and just the way everything looks. It totally goes with that era. This is because it was that time era when the hotels were being built.     The reason my family and I were going there this summer, was to celebrate my Grandpa's 90th birthday. So I had lots of Aunts, Uncles, cousin's, 2nd cousins, 3rd cousins, etc. Lots of people I've never even met before. It was similar to a family reunion.     It must be very interesting to be 90 years old. He's lived through a lot. Two world wars, and the great depression. He was around my age during the great depression. He's had a very full life. He's extremely religious for some reason. He almost entered the priesthood, like many of his brothers did but instead chose to be a teacher. He taught at a University of some kind. Very full life.     I spent much of my vacation there at the beach, in the pool, and talking with my aunts and uncles. I haven't seen them in nearly two years. They're pretty cool. One of them lives in New York City. I've been to New York City many times because my Father used to commute to work there everyday, and sometimes I would go to work with him. There's many tall buildings, people, and homeless people. I've never lived there, but I think it would be nice to live there.     I forgot to mention the boardwalk in Wildwood. It's all of these boards nailed together and you wall all over them. They also stick all of these game booths and stores and shit on the side of them. Lots of rides too! Like rollercoaster and about million other rides of some sort. The boardwalk is always a great place to be.

      This is my thirteenth blog post.  Best Buy sucks.  I went to my Best Buy job interview only to discover that it was a huge waste of my time.  I blame the manager who may have been a homosexual.  Not that there's anything wrong with that!  I'm just saying...  Anyway, After he asked me the dumb questions and shit, he told me he wants experience for the job.  Which surprised me because it clearly says on my job application that I have no experience at all.  Why would he call me to the job interview if it says right on the application that I've never had a job before?  Is it to waste my time?  Because I can't see any other reason.  Maybe it's because I wasn't cute enough for him.  I've decided that because Best Buy wasted my time, I won't be shopping there anymore.  Those people suck.  I also sent an angry email to Best Buy explaining what had happened.    It's ok.  I didn't want to work there anyway.  I also put in an application for Walgreens.  The same thing will happen over and over again.  Work experience, etc.  I blame Bush.  If Kerry were president, I bet I would have a job of some sort right now.  Damn liberals!

      This is my twelfth blog post.  I had a very good Fourth of July.  The main reason is because My family and I set off those small firework things.  It was great!  Today was also very good, and included many events.  I have recently been looking for gainful employment.  I sent an application to Best Buy over the internet a few days ago, and today they called to set up an interview for tomorrow at 12.  This is good.  I like Best Buy and I hope they hire me.  I decided that there was no way I would stand a chance of being hired with hippy hair so I got it all cut off.  I guess I look more like a Best Buy employee rather than a fucking moron.  I think I'll get hired.  Why wouldn't they hire me?  Because I have no work experience?  Probably.  Work experience is the biggest crock of shit since Crystal Pepsi.    I'm pretty nervous about the job interview.  I've never been to one.  I think I figured out what they'll probably ask me and what I'll say.  I hope I don't screw it up.  I wouldn't mind an employee discount for Best Buy.  If there is one.  I think there is.  In other news, John Kerry finally chose his Vice President pick!  It's John Edwards.  I have no feelings for that at the moment.

      This is my seventeenth Blog post.  I have kick ass news! My parents bought a really awesome 51 inch Widescreen TV. It's really awesome. I can't wait to watch TV and movies on it. The old TV was good. But this one just shits all over it! It comes on Tuesday.  Also, I decided to try again and get a job. My mother is a medical transcriptionist at a hospital. Apparently they have some jobs available like cleaning work and kitchen stuff. Hopefully I'll get some fucking work. Getting a damn job is stressful. It really sucks. Also, I think, this shitty doughnut place is hiring. I don't like doughnuts that much.  Having a job is important. I really want one. But it's difficult to get one. I blame our capitalist society! With its work experience and economy that's kind of sucks but it's a little good.  Sometime this week I'm going to take the god damn test to get my driver's permit thing. For the second time. I FAILED the first time...by default. I accidentally submitted the wrong answer that I wanted to submit. It sucked. I knew the answer, but I went too quickly and fucked up. It won't happen again. It will.  My school year starts soon.  I'm not sure how I feel about this.

      This is my sixteenth Blog post.  Getting a job is tough work. Either they don't call, make a mistake in advertising for the job (Like not saying you need to be 18 even though you do, so you go but they tell you to leave), or they don't look at your application where they can very easily see that you have no experience but waste your time by calling you in for an interview anyway. This is complete bullshit.  Why the hell do places not call? They say they'll call. Can't they just call and say I suck at getting a job, and that they don't want me anywhere near them? Of course they could! But they don't! Because they're all assholes.  Fuck getting a job.  I quit.   I went to Blockbuster today.  I got two movies.  13 going on 30 -- This was an ok movie but it couldn't keep my interest very well. It's about this girl who wishes she was "thirty, flirty, and thriving." She says it over and over again. Anyway, because of this god damn dust that her friend, the not-so-cool Matt, got for her.  It works!  Now she's a big time magazine editor. And thirty! Also flirty as she tries to date a 13-year-old kid! Whoa, pedophile! I thought the movie would go in a much more interesting direction had her friend not stopped her, and allowed the relationship to develop. Nope, instead she hooks up with her old time buddy, Matt. He's still not cool. :-(  Anyway, Matt is a very unlikeable character. He seems uncomfortable in almost any situation he's in! Fuck, man. This guy's weirded out by anything. He also likes Razzles. Razzles are candies that apparently make your tongue red. And bring old friends together.  For some reason she goes back to being 13. And is about to have sex with Matt, but then rips upt his girl's paper for no reason at all! What the fuck!?!?!? You god damn whore! Then she goes back to being thirty. But this time she's thriving, as she is married to Matt. And then they eat Razzles.  I really only got this movie because it had Jennifer Garner in it. She's pretty. But the movie lacks a logically sound plot, and therefore sucks. I give it 2 out of 7 stars.   The next movie I got was Kill Bill volume 2.  It's a very good movie.  A little better than the first.  7 out of 7 stars.
