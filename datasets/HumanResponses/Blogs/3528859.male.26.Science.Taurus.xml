       urlLink    I suppose North Carolina can be pretty, too.  I figure it took me four years to  get  Los Angeles, so perhaps the aesthetic sinks in if I give due time.

      So, it took some doing but I finally tracked down what they're building at LaSalle and Erwin Rd.  The construction nearest my apartment will be a mixed use area called  urlLink Erwin Terrace , and the construction across LaSalle will be “the Lofts at Lakeview”.  The Lofts are luxury apartments and seem a bit crazy.  Evidently the bizarre bunker-like structure being built is indeed a parking garage—six stories of parking garage!—and the apartment plans include a gourmet commons, theater room and internet café.  A bit hard to picture, and harder yet to price.  (All this courtesy Chamber-of-Commerce  urlLink online records .)  It seems  urlLink Durham  has a surprisingly strong electronic presence, and some of the planning documents (e.g. for my neck of the woods,  urlLink West Durham ) are interesting.  It's nice to get a little insight into how cities are planned.  I'm a fan of this trend toward new urbanism—extensive reliance on mixed use areas, generally complemented by green corridors and public transportation—but it almost always connotes gentrification, in practice.  Anyway, there’s no information yet on who my new neighbors will be.  At least it’s too small for a Walmart.  Ideal would be a corner grocer, a new &amp; used music store, an indy late-night coffee shop, and a decent Thai or Indian place.  Ah, ‘twould be heaven.  I’ve exhausted my investigative abilities, though: I’ll have to wait-and-see on what we actually get.

      As I've reorganized the webpage, these comments needed to find a new home.  This gets quite technical and are probably nonsensical with reference to  urlLink this overview .   Those of you who've paid close attention might have noticed that the  urlLink "Harmony and Natural Sounds" paper  has continued to experience sporadic revision. Most recently, it was to admit the Harmonic Series LFACd2 predicts a minor 3rd more consonant than a major 3rd. This is pretty unreasonable, but my sense had been that harmonic series and speech performed fairly similarly overall. To formalize this, I examined all pairwise consonance comparisons reviewed in Malmberg (e.g. "Stumpf reports Fifth > Fourth") and counted the portion agreeing with the various prediction methods in the paper. The papers Malmberg reviewed both overlapped and sometimes contradicted one another, so the percentages I ended up occupying a compressed range (almost all in the 60s). Nonetheless, it was as I suspected:   Speech LFACd2 (equal temperament) performed best, predicted 67.53% of pairwise results reviewed in Malmberg 1918. At justly-intoned intervals it did almost as well, with 66.07%. Of mean peak-normalized spectra, the most analogous method (examining suboctave intervals both directions from peak) performed slighly better at justly-intoned intervals but much worse at equal-tempered. This performance was the best of any peak-normalized spectra.   As for the Harmonic Series LFACd2 predictions, which after all started this whole mess, I found neither a great fit nor disqualification. Using just-intonation, harmonic series LFACd2 matched 65.8% of the claims in Malmberg. It was again quite sensitive to subtle variations in tuning -- switching to equal temperament decimated the consonance prediction at the minor 3rd interval, for example, but dramatically increased the predicted consonance at the minor second. The net consequence reduced the fit to Malmberg, but more generally piqued my skepticism about the method.   This all superficially supports my paper, of course, but I have misgivings about the hypersensitivity of these predictions to subtle (perhaps imperceptible!) differences in tuning.   It is true that during our lives we learn to ignore subtle mistunings.  We know that most humans internalize culturally-variant aspects of musical scales by about 5 years, and perhaps we've all learned to conflate equal temperament with just intoned.  But this would seem to militate against the whole these that these traits are inborn, or natural consequences of our auditory environment.  Alternately, I wonder if I've overfit my data, (I examined only one typical harmonic series), or if the biological basis for harmony is more crudely filtered than I've here assumed.   In the end I suppose the best answers won't come from psychophysics, but from electrophysiology. My suspicion is that these statistics are useful for Bayesian tuning algorithms in the ear (implemented perhaps by outer hair cells), for unifying input from single sound sources (in early auditory processing), and possibly for establishing speaker identity and mood (in appropriate cortices).    At a talk a few months back, Frederic Theunissen noted that temporally-invariant spectral statistics were conspicuously absent in avian brain nuclei. I believe this is consistent with our data.  If you want to understand the content of message, for example, you specifically ignore the handwriting -- similarities across units don't interest you, you want to rather differentiate each letter from the others. Cortical areas involved in semantics would thus ignore "handwriting", while both early processing (e.g. in auditory brainstem) and areas involved in social interpretation (e.g. speaker identity and intonation, associated in humans with right hemisphere) would be much more likely to represent these features. I've encouraged Theunissen to investigate a particular aspect of all this, specifically the phase offset in his metaspectral analysis (his units are cycles/hertz). This should extract vocal characteristics associated (in humans) with speech formants, which vary both by speaker (static) and vocalization (dynamic).  Teasing these apart should help us understand how our neural machinery processes these distinct computations.

      It seems I've revised  urlLink my website  much more quickly than I expected.  A bit hack and slash, and no major improvements, but at least things are of-a-piece.  It strikes me that my kvetching about multithread blogging was kinda ridiculous, given Blogger has exactly the same capability -- if I linked from my website to my profile, instead of a particular blog, I could have separately-updated sections.  Nonetheless, that fails to capture the key attraction of a blog: frequent updates posted to a signle location.  Here's what kinda surprises me, given that Blogger is owned by Google: why isn't there a convenient "search" option in the blog user interface?  I dunno, perhaps I just have explored insufficiently.  In the meantime, enjoy the updates.  My next goal is to get the photoblog working -- I'm pretty curious how it will integrate.  Best, all.

      I've been pondering a bit what to do in Iraq, and how to evaluate whether we've "succeeded" in whatever our mission was.  I'm going to go with the Blair / Friedman version of the neocon argument: basically, that Saddam was worth taking out if we had an excuse, and that the overthrow of his government presented a great opportunity to remake Iraq into a model Arabian state, a beacon of modern democracy.  This always seemed far-fetched, but now that the facts hit the fan it seems we've got to make the best of this situation we've found ourselves in.  So the Coalition has brought low Saddam, and the Iraqi GC seems to be lumbering toward some sort of theoretical government, which in turn will muddle toward some sort of Constitution.  This all seems pretty good, if fragile.  I'm not to concerned about theocracy or communism or what not.  But I am pretty concerned about civil war, human rights and democratic reform.  I guess the main things I hope for out of the new Iraqi are constitution are (a) federalism, in particular some system of internal checks-and-balances (b) human rights, in particular freedom of expression, religious freedom, right to due process, and universal suffrage (c) elections as soon as possible.  If we acheive these things w/o the government splintering into civil war, I think that however messy things may be, they'll work out in the long run.  That is, if we don't forget about them.  Anybody heard anything from Afghanistan lately?

      (by which I mean you, Mom,)  It appears that my attempt at multithread blogging on my homepage didn't really work.  I guess I'll try to do it by categorically titling posts, here, instead.  In any case, it'll be a little bit before I restructure my website and consolidate everything in a reasonable way, but hopefully this will come together.  I understand there is fairly straightforward photoblogging, now, as well -- I think I'd come up with a pretty good solution on my own, but if this gets me more space it's hard to turn it down.  In the meantime, hope you're all well.

       urlLink "The two groups crossed paths at an intersection and exchanged angry words. A brief scuffle broke out between some of the peace demonstrators and a man carrying a graphic anti-abortion sign. The man was pushed to the ground and his shirt was torn but he appeared unhurt."   I don't have a lot to say about the DNC and RNC protests, really.  But I do have a general comment: if we're committed to nonviolence, let's be nonviolent, eh?  There's a time when we have no choice but to get all Malcolm X on somebody, I understand that.  But if it's important to us to support peace and free speech, we've got to demonstrate that with more than just our sign.  Speaking of "free speech".  I understand this photo is of the DNC "Free Speech Zone" and not, for example, of Gitmo.  To clarify, the "Free Speech Zone" is the part  inside  the barbed wire...   urlLink       I don't know  what  that says about the outside.

       urlLink    Yesterday I grabbed a North Carolina lunch—pork butt sandwhich, okra, hushpuppies—and set out to the Arts Integrity building on Trinity and Washington.  There's no handy bench, so I made a table of the car: me with napkins in hand and camera in pocket, thinking about this  urlLink story  in the  urlLink Herald-Sun .  The neighborhood is pretty industrial, a bit dull, and this arts group rented a place and proclaimed the walls fair game for graffiti artists.  Some officials were up-in-arms, fearing the gangs would perceive a "graffiti gap" and get all overzealous.  I'm pretty psyched about it, myself.  After living so long in LA, it feels kind of homey: Durham's an urban town, skyline or no, it's just nice to see that in addition to the murders, we get some cityscape art in the deal.  urlLink    That said, it  is  funny how we like to sign our name to things, to leave our mark.  Two friends and I once went to great lengths to hike into wilderness unspoilt by man.  (I overstate: we were hiking a trail, but the trailhead was ten miles up a dirt road.  And to our credit, we promptly got lost.)  Anyway, when we come to this neat little waterfall, what do we do?  We spend a half day mucking about, changing its course.  Nothing destructive—at least not intentionally—we just wanted to involve ourselves, to sign our names.  urlLink    I guess graffiti is the city analog of all that.  At the waterfall, we took something natural and altered it.  A good graffiti artist takes something artificial, and, well, makes it art.  It's a damn site more than mere tagging, and if there's a way to pretty up the desolate walls of industry... well, that's to the good.  I look forward to see where this thing goes, and hope the city cuts them some slack.  urlLink

      Miro and I worked out this translation a long time ago, but never got around to posting it anywhere. Nerez was this awesome Czech band, a neat blend of jazz and folk. Anyway, this seems to have been their best album and was, in my opinion at least, their best song.  NEREZ: MASOPUST - "Tisíc dnů mezi námi"  Antirust: The Carnival - "One Thousands Days Between Us"  (hudba/music: Z. Vřešťál, V. Sázavský, text: V. Sázavský)  Ocelově modrou masku máš pátý týden se ti bráním den za dnem si na nit navlékáš korálky s vůní našich dlaní  You have a steel-blue mask I have resisted you for five weeks Day after day, you string a thread With beads scented by our palms   Světlo a tma tak to jsem já  Light and darkness, that is me  zhasni a dělej, co se dělat může  Turn the light off, do what you are allowed  Světlo a tma tak to jsem já  Light and darkness, that is me  jestli chceš, nezůstane na mně ani kůže  If you want, I will shed even my skin   Telefonní seznam nových tváří to je tvůj polštář pod mou hlavou zatržená jména v kalendáři pátý týden ve vzduchu plavou  A directory of new faces That is your pillow under my head Ticked names on the calendar Have floated in the air these five weeks   Světlo a tma tak to jsem já  Light and darkness, that is me  zhasni a dělej, co se dělat může  Turn the light off, do what you are allowed  Světlo a tma tak to jsem já  Light and darkness, that is me  jestli chceš, nezůstane na mně ani kůže  If you want, I will shed even my skin   Tisíc dnů mezi námi jako nekonečno nevypadá našel jsem tě kdysi ve stohu slámy ještě dnes mi za košili padáš  One thousand days between us Do not look like an eternity I found you in a stack of straw once You still fall behind my shirt   Tisíckrát vlasy rozcuchaný vlasy rozcuchaný jako křoví máš sladká jak hrušky planý v hlavě mám z tebe galimatyáš  One thousand times disheveled Your hair is as tangled as a briar You are as sweet as wild pears You are a puzzle in my head   Tisíckrát přešívaný knoflíček u krku máš a tvůj smích zvoní stejně jako hrany v hlavě mám z tebe galimatyáš  One thousand times resewn This button at your neck Your laughter is the toll of a bell You are a puzzle in my head

       urlLink Mr Bush yesterday dismissed the idea that his policies were helping recruit terrorists. "It is a ridiculous notion to assert that, because the United States is on the offensive, more people want to hurt us," he said. "We’re on the offensive because people do want to hurt us."   Woah.  You show 'em there, cowboy.
