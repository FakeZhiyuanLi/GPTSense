      Summer school is a total bore. I only have one class after all. Stupid admissions office. I have to go in at 10:07, so I'm stuck at home with nothing to do. I can't go anywhere, my favorite music store Penny Lane isn't open till 11: something or rather. And if that weren't enough, drumroll please... No. Cute. Guys. In. My. Class. I have nothing to look at when I'm done with my work. But there is one guy I like so far. He's in my bff's class. Curse you Kim!!!! LOL j/k.  ~Still Bored. Katie.

      I hung out at Andrea's Geeze her brother's hawt *drools* Meh, whatever. I tried to sk8 again but...feel flat on my back ....again. *grumbles*  I miss my friends already. It's alot harder than I thought. Sk8ing I mean. I used to be good then I suck. It kinda gives me an excuse to have Chris attempt to teach me and hold me. *blushes*  Everything hurts....blah.....  Adios, Katie.

"Beaner" -Phillip "The White Boy"  ~lol hahaha he calls himself the white boy because...he is. The only one in the school.   Hey Katie, guess what? Orlando Bloom is the hottest!!! :) Well, hope you had a great year and maybe I'll see you in AHS :) Take care, never change." -   ~Mandy's cool, she has an unhealthy obsession with Mr. Bloom. ^ ^  "Curse you! Curse you as long as you live. Curse you until the end of the world. Curseyoucurseyoucurseyou CURSE....you're lucky I'm tired now. Have a good summer." -Hunter Huang  ~Insider joke but still very funny.  "Hey Kate, You are a strange person, but in a good way. Have a good summer have fun and don't do anything I wouldn't do." -Brain Mejia  ~Omgomgomgomgogmogmogmogmg ....wait? Don't do anything he won't do? Very short list.  "Hey Katie I'm gonna miss you and Squirrel Man." -James a.k.a. Lil Buddy.  ~Squirrel Man knows all!!!!!!!  "Hola Katie, have a good summer and keep up with the guys. P.S. U r a strange person." -Chris Ramos.  ~Brian's cuz, he's cuter. With his lil pink sk8board....he's not gay. Thankfully he's punk.   "Hey Katestah, Have a great summer fo' shizzle." -Danny Yu.  ~0_o ....Yeah.....whatever, he's cute.  The other ones were generic "Have a good summer" "See you at AHS" (Alhambra High School) meh...  ~Kata the Mexican chic who can't sk8 without falling.

      I got back from the mountains a while back...It was so fun. My aunt just turn 60... the old fart. j/k ^ ^ She lives in the San Bernidino mounts. Went to the creek got wet. Learn about my future husband...I mean...future husband? Now in list form:  1) He sniffs his brother's magical hair-styling stuff. (His bro has greaser style hair.) That explains his drop in grades. Mwahaha.  2)His last name is Villen...something. It means village in Spanish. I forget the rest.  3) I have cheese in my pocket and damnit I feel special.  4)....The end  Lol till something interesting happens, Katie ^ ^

      Unfortunately, I lack a good social life. So I'll entertain you with a song and dance...haha no.   I bet your wondering am I really a punk? Well...so how about them Lakers. Joking! (They suck by the way. I know I'm from Los Angeles and all but really) I'm working on the whole discovering-what-I-am. And for the last time Nick (that is if you are reading this) I am not a Goth. Just clarifying that.  Some people say I'm close to emo others say I'm sk8er. (shows how much they know me. When I sk8 I spend more time with my face kissing the floor)   So, That's it. Hopefully...Raccoon alarm clock of doom!!! Sorry, bored.   adios random people. Katie the confused girl. ^ ^

      I finally got a freaking phone. Whoo? So far it's just been there, I never call anyone not even that cute pizza dude, Derrick to get a pizza. I don't call relatives, I don't call friends. Who's bright idea was this?   Balls. Heehee ^_^ I threw a ball at my love. Mwahahaha that will teach him..for something...I forgot what though. Meh whatever. I got his older brother to throw the ball at him too. Good times. Good times. *shakes head with a dreamy gaze*   I'm not with him. So to speak I'm not allowed and we're just friends. JUST FRIENDS. And I happen to have the hots for him.  lol ~kt
