      its too bad cuz i was all ready to give away a delicious au bon pain confetti cookie to the winner of my little trivia contest. either nobody read it or nobody knows the answer.  well here it is either way.  Mickey Knox was Woody Harrelsons character in the Tarantino penned Natural Born Killers.  QT didnt actually get screen credit for the flick, Ollie Stone took it despite little of it being changed from the original.  i dont really want to flat out call stone a hack, he has done some good work, lets just say hes hackish.

      Looks like the plans have been finalized. i will be coming to md this weekend.  the sb bash at paul new digs should be kick ass.  the trivia question i posted yesterday still stands, but only till i get in to work tomorrow.  smallville was avg last night and so was angel. next week is the big 100th angel ep and i d being lying to ya if i said i wasnt a little excited. keen eddie on tuesday was great, mmmm Lady of the Lift.  Panthers will win the sb, btw.  video games dont lie. and neither does 9 and 0, but then again neither does 13 and 0. thoughts, comment on the lingerie bowl. angie everhart said on stern this morn that those ladies were playing to win and that she is shunning docs orders and playing despite injury. im impressed. isnt annoying when your listening to a classic rock station and a good song comes on and its actually i commercial. wtf.

      I wasnt planning on posting anything today.. Didnt go to work.  Woke up late after going to sleep with already a few inches of snow on the ground.  Spent half my day shoveling my driveway, steps and sidewalk (i really have to get out of this house by the way) and the other half on some neglected dvds of purchased over the last few months or so.  But when i read the excited responses to my last post and liz's bitchin stream of con post that started with superman is dead and ending with a quirky new yorker story (like theres any other kind) i just had to do something.  First off the entire absurdity of the Oscar process can be summed up by stating the simple fact that Martin Scorsese has never won a best director oscar.   Id rather not do the research and see the list of all the unremarkable clown noses that have won in the time since scorsese started, not to mention over the entirety of its history.  As for todays dvd watching i started out with watching most of the extras on Once Upon a Time in Mexico.  Slowly im beginning to realize that Robert Rodriguez is my hero.  I dont feel like going on the Rob Rod is kick ass rant, you just gotta trust me on that one.  Ive got an unbelievable profile on him i read over the summer in Movieline, maybe ill post that if i can find the copy i made of it. Long story short, he rules.  After watching the extras i changed things up a bit, considering the time i had to waste today and the relevance to Rodriguez's flick as well as Kill Bill and other QT flicks, i watched Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West.  Its not as good as The Good The Bad and the Ugly, but that may be the greatest movie of all time, but  West was an epic like ive never seen before.  It was just a beautiful movie.  Bronson was tremendous as the strong silent nameless type a la Clint. Claudia Cardinale was off the charts sexy as the just widowed whore who has three men who seem to want her for their own selfish agendas.  The most valiant being that of escaped prisoner Cheyenne played by Jason Robards.  The most sexual, but not at all deviant, being Frank, who happens to be the real bad guy of the bunch.  A bit of trivia for ya.(imdb peaking is not allowed, honor system like a mofo) The first cedit on the end credits is "dialog by  Mickey Knox."  Where in the Tarantinoverse does this name appear.  First person to get this right gets a cookie.   btw: a couple of notes to liz, you totally forgot Bill and Teds most excellent time traveling phone booth.  and on very geeky superman note, i suggest reading Kevin Smiths draft of the  urlLink Superman Lives  (where Superman dies) storyline in a movie script and then watching the An Evening with Kevin Smith dvd where he talks about the crazy guy who was trying to produce the movie.  Superman dying was right around the time i stopped collecting those things, coincidence...i dont think so.

      Heres what wrong with televised award shows.  Who the fuck votes for them.  I dont know them.  You dont know them.  The "foreign press," what the fuck does that mean and why do Americans, or the actors for tha matter, even care what they say.  And then theres the Oscars, voted on by "the Academy."  From what i know of the academy its a bunch of old dried up shrivs that wouldnt know social or national relevance if it fell on their plate of silver platter served apple sauce with a bendy straw.  The american public fiends for movie reviews for 364 days out of the year.  people become obsessed with reviewes and critics that critics become pseudo celebrities themselves.  every network has a reviewer seemingly one for every news broadcast local and national.  newspapers often have teams of reviewers that take turns weekly salivating over who gets to call the next hollywood terd stinky, and stretch it over 15 graphs.  studios often refuse reviewers a chance to preview movies that they know suck so as to circumvent the system.  people like stars, and thumbs and other easily digestible reviews, but the oscars somehow are held in the highest regard.  Instead of professionals movie evaluators, and i use the term professional loosely, we get people who need to have the movie mailed to them so they can see it and dont have to get off their overpaid asses and actually shell out ten bucks to see them like the rest of us.  How has America been so thoroughly duped.  Is this just me or am i pissing in the wind here.  Rant over.

      Story from the comic con #2: Well its not really a story it was just something cool i picked up.  There was this dude there who runs a movie website, FEARSmag.com, i think.  He had a booth set up in the are of the con where a bunch of studio type stuff was set up (miramax had a table, club dred had a table, etc.).  On the wall behind him he had a bunch of posters up and on teh table in front of him he had a bunch of cool movie swag like stickers, buttons and other nick nacks(my favorite being a 28 Days Later sticker that says "The End is Deffinitely Fucking Nigh." .  So im all, how can i get me some of that.  Hes like give me 25 bucks and your signed up to the site for a year, you get all the posters you see behind me, a goodie bag with all these nick nacks, 3 t-shirts, som fantasy book (Tom style) and invites to free preview screening, the next being broken lizards follow up to super troopers, club dred.  How can i turn that down.  And they were full sizeposter too.  I wound up with 7 or 8 posters in the end.  I could probably sell 2 posters on ebay and make my money back.  Some hilites of the package: Matrix Revolutions poster with the 3-D look, Alien directors cut rerelease double sided poster, Hellboy poster, cabin fever bloody bandaid stickers, freddy v jason prescription pill bottle filed with red mike and ikes, underworld necklace medallion thingy. Well worth the 25 bones.

      What a sunday.  Too many things to put in one post Ill try and put up two or three to give each memorable occurance that i must share with the world its due prescience.  Ill start with the coolest and work my way down.  I went to this comic convention here in manhattan on sunday.  Before people start thinking, "i didnt realize Berger was a comics geek," ill tell you the reason i wen is because im a movie geek, and quite of a Tarantino, and that leads me to the reason i went.  David Carradine.  The man.  The myth. The Legend.  He spoke to a moderate sized crowd, telling stories of his most excellent career in the biz, as wel as a working on Kill Bill.  I dont know if he had been smoking the weed, but he was one of te most chilled out dudes youd ever come across.  When he walked, and his movements in general, were very deliberate, but also very still and in control.  He talked about Kill Bill and how he spent a year on the movie, 3 months training and 9 months filming. Leading me to believe hell be featured heavily in Vol 2, cuz he was bare in Vol 1.  He said he spent 3 weeks solid on one fight with Michael Jai White.  He also enjoyed rubbing it in that he got to train with five beautiful women for those 3 months.  My fav story was when some dude, who seemed to be comic convention regular, asked Carradine about some kung fu master that he had worked with.  Nobody knew who he was talking about except carradine of course who had worked with him and was friends with him. This guy supposedly was a master bud had no discernable style.  He claimed to have been taught at a very young age by an imaginary friend.  The guy was an undefeated cage fighter.  Then he asked carradine to get him a stunt gig.  He gets this motorcycle stunt where hes supposed to fly off the bike and hit a table.  He pulls it off, stands up all crooked cuz his shoulder is dislocated, but says hes fine.  He pulls a Riggs and says lets go again. Carradine said he eventually became a stunt coordinator and was briefly on Kung Fu the Legend Continues, but left because it was "too pussy."  Carradine ended the hour by grabbing an accoustic guitar and played this great twangy, bluesy number where he sings about being an asshole to his woman and the chorus basically said "im evil baby."  Tremendous.

      Would have loved to have posted something on friday, but i got swamped with work on top of having to leave foer a meeting at 1:30.  The clusterfuck of incoming meant that i had to bring work home for the weekend.  I go like 2 weeks with little to know actual work, them on friday i get slammed with it, left only to do on the weekend.  Much sweetness.  Plus im a big loser and am doing nothing on this frosty saturday night.   Saw Dawn of the Dead on thursday night though and loved it.  My fav of the trilogy.  Its like Romero upped the ante for this one and hit the perfect note.  The humor, the gore, suspense, action, scares, all of it was there.  In Day, obviously he tried to up that another notch, but it didnt work at all.  Aparently Day is some sort of slight on the military, but that gets lost in the ridiculous charicatures they are created as, the Bono lookalike main bad guy especially.  Dawn is more a poke at American consumerism, as one of several memorable exachges describes the reason for the zombies coming to the mall was because it was something they remember doing, "this palce was important to them."  And who doesnt dream of doing what they get to do in this movie.  Live in an abandoned mall, feeding off all the ameninities your average mega mall has to offer, clothing, furniture, weaponry, etc.  I just found a link to this video.  It is a must see.  If your in an office i warn that its quicktime and that you need to hear the audio. It may not work right away cuz i found the link on aicn.com and it might get smashed. Its well worth the time to check back on it.   urlLink Peanuts do Outkast .

      So last night was a real Tivo night. Not that i have Tivo, but if i did, it would probably have to be working overtime with the amount of tv i attempted to simultaneously view. There were 3 basketball games, 2 shows and one dvd and something was destined to get lost in the shuffle. Sorry Day of the Dead. That leaves Knicks v Rockets with vengeance implications, Nets v Spurs with rematch implications and  Terps v Dookies with alma mater implications. On the show side there is Smallville a show that consistentl shows me something to geek out about and then crushes it with a high school drama storyline and Angel, my new favorite show on TV.  Knicks game started out hot, but got ugly and stayed ugly till the end, so i was able to shun that one pretty much after the first quarter, Nets was probably on the bottom of my priority list, but that didnt become a blowout till the third or fourth.  The terps seemed like they might get blown out but they kept coming back, but i was able to watch the last part of the game without flipping for the exciting, but dissapointing, finale.  Watching the contact refs were allowing in that game down the stretch was baffling. And the offensive rebounds that duke were getting drove me up the wall.  So with the low quality of b-ball, that left me with a good excuse to watch smallville and angel without missing much good sports.  smallville was a solid episode, wht got me really geeked about it though was Clark Kent first time putting on the signature  Kent glasses.  Otherwise it was a pretty average ep.    Angel on the other hand recently has become a near obsession for me. i saw a few episodes of it on tnt over the summer and thought it seemed like a cool show, dark, with demons and vampires, a sense of humor, attractive females, at times noirish.  Right up my alley, so through netflix i rented the entire first two seasons and now i love the show, cant get enough of it.  season 3 comes out next month and i cant wait to ifnd out what ive missed.  Highly recommend the show to any one i talk too.   Last night episode was the return of character that left in season 2, but mostly it was a great phychoanalysis of what has happened to the titular character and his team of investigators, as it seems they may have been corrupted by the forces they have spent so long attempting defeat.  This is seen through hallucination and dreams brought on by a parasitic demon bugger that hooks onto a host and pumps him full of halucinagens.  Angel has all of these dreams as all of his friends seem to turn on him, my fav scene is when the scientist chick cut him open and finds a shriveled walnut for a heart and a fishbowl for a soul. Enuff ramble ramble from me. Back to work i go.

      Day of the Dead finally came last night.  Havent watched it yet, but i have seen a few part of it in the past and i know that basically a bunch of people baracade themselvse into a mall to escape the zombies.   I watched Keen Eddie last night and flipped over to the State o the Union as much as i could, my timing was deadly though as i probably saw 90% standing Os and 10% speech.  I did manage see that Tom Brady was in the crowd shown to punctate Dubya's point to eradicate steroid use in sports.  I was waiting for a mention of a hard salary cap in baseball or removing te blue line in hockey, maybe next year. Keen Eddie was the shit.  Best line of the night was some dude calling Eddie's obsession/undoing/smoking-brunette, Boobs McPerky (or was it Perky McBoobs). Lots of great one liners.  Crazy, trippy soundrack by Orbital, i especially like the twisting and reiteration of The Archies "Sugar, Sugar," specifically when drugs were around. Get it...cocaine...sugar...nevermind.  And blondes with english accents, how can you possibly go wrong. The lovely Sienna Miller does the whole Moonlighting thing with Eddie. Scumtrilescent. Going out today from Netflix will be Existenz and Spider as i continue on my Cronenberg kick that started a couple weeks ago with Crash.  Im still not sure what my opinion is on that "movie" but it sure was...something.  I think i was inspired to seek Cronenberg out after he had a 2 or 3 episode arc on Alias. One other note, 28 Days Later is a quality zombie flick and would fit right in with Romeros classics  or  with new fare like Freed v Jason and Cabin Fever. And finally if your like me, you're pumped to see tha latest take on the batman by Crish Nolan sceduled to start filming soon.  Check the new, improved and beefy soon to be Dark Knight Christian Bale urlLink  .

      A couple of weeks ago i read that hollywood is remaking yet another classic film. Dawn of the Dead. Now im not sure if its a conglomerate of Romero's dead trilogy or if its actually remaking that specific movie, but i realized i hadnt really seen any of the trilogy. Bing bang boom. a week later, netflix and i have start a mini Dead marathon weekend.  Night of the Living Dead was the shit. This is from 1968, but its in black and white.  it was really creepy. it was gory, but probably less so then i actually remember. you see the implied gore was more scary then any blood waterfall could ever be.  there were a lot of good scares, some in the jumping out from behind something variety, some in the creepy sidling variety (zombie specialty) and some in the crazy guy is going to get the sane guys killed variety.  this is a true classic.    unfortunately the post office wasnt in a cooperating mood so, Day of the Dead came after Dawn of the Dead despite the fact Day was mailed a day later. so i skipped right to Dawn.  Day of the Dead came out in 1985 and is the third of the trilogy.  This movie was a little too eighties for my liking. maybe with those types of expectations i would have liked this flick better, but that didnt happen.  somehow the color 1985 flick seemed more dated to me then the b & w 68 flick.   Night is about a group of people who come together in a house the night the dead come alive and they bicker over how to protect themselves and if help will ever come as they hunker around the constant newsradio updates.  Day is about a bunch of army dudes and a few scientistis and civilians struggling to survive each other in a secret army bunker with zombies a few hundred feet away over ground and behind a fence.  As for the 80s-ness of Day, you have a captain who is way way WAY over the top asshole to the scientists, cursing way too much and with zero humor, the gore is off the charts, the music sounds like it was created on a casio, people said funny or ironic things after killing (including one of the zombies).  Note for the true geeks out there: the main scientists name was Logan and his favorite zombie subject was named Bub. Logan is Marvel Comic's fav Wolverine's real name and "bub" is one of his favorite things to call people.  And lastly i suggest everyone tunes into Bravo tonight as the return premeire of summer fav Keen Eddie. For anyone who likes Guy Ritchie movies, pre-Madonna, this is must see TV.

      Today is the beginning of a new era. Man will tremble before the posting of my meandering toughts and constant typoes relating to such world altering subjects as sports and movies (and maybe even comic books).  Why has this godsend been thrust upon the web worldwide you ask. Simple. Because it  must . Why  must  it you ask. Cuz...thats why.  Also im at work and pretty bored.  On this blog i will post random thoughts and some not so random thoughts. I will post reviews and previews. fact and fiction. opinion and hearsay.  Today is the start of a new day. Night is gone and a new dawn has arrived. Today is the end. Today is the begining.  Mark it down on your calendars, with a red pen, a smiley face, two stars, some scratch n sniff stickers and never forget that you were there in the beginning.  Good day.

      i wonder if anyone has ever lived solely off of spicy tuna rolls and endamame.  that is some good eatins.  great first-episode-since-being-canceled angel last night.  i hope somebody gives ben edlund a chance to do his own series cuz what he did directing, producing and co authoring last night was bloody brilliant. this week my neil gaiman obsession has brought me to a collection of some of his sandman comics i picked up at the comiccon a few weeks back. wow, talk about brilliant.  on another gaiman note part seven of his 8 part 1602 series came out last week and that was brilliant and on monday i finally finished his 1990 collaboration with Terry Pratchett (that Terry Gilliam want to amke into a movie) Good Omens.  If you happen to come from the old school of comics and the new school of literature (especially of the brit persuasion) 1602 is a must read.  It sets all of the classic marvel characters in the year 1602, unaware that they dont belong but existing as though they do. Cosmic malpractice is afoot.  Also it takes place mostly in the Britains and the New World with an intrigal appearance by first natural born american Virginia Dare of the lost Roanoke colony.  Good Omens on the other hand is the story of the antichrists appearance on earth. he is brought to an satanic convent but accidentally sent thome with the wrong parent...wackiness ensues.  Seriously though, the book is hilarious.  If anybodys read Douglas Adams Hitchhiker Guide to the Galaxy books, its in the same vein of brit wit, which i personally love.  oh and might be going to see belvaux 3d part of the trilogy tonight.  ramble on...

      Why do i bother? i finally start getting into something on tv and all goes to shit. last week i decided smallville is falling apart and lost all momentum it gained from last seasons finale and thise seasons first few eps. also i reminded myself that the superman character is intrinsically a pussy and who wants to watch that.  the big news though is the WB canceled Angel today.  Look, im not gonna piss and moan about networks pulling shows that dont make them money.  its a business. whatever, but this show was good. period. i dont know why people dont pick up on this.  the show seemed to have something for everybody and combined drama, action and comedy better then anything ive ever seen on tv, certainly anything thats on tv now. this just goes on to reiterate the fact that i dont get people.  i dont get reality shows. bah...trying to...concoct...coherent... thought... mind... numbing. ah fuck it. at least there going to let them finish off the season. the rookie game was travesty to the game of basketball im going to bed, somebody wake me when baseball season starts, or at least when the first fantasy draft comes

      I saw part deux of the Belveaux trilogy last night, Un couple épatant or An Amazing Couple. this one was a comedy. i liked it a lot. ill probably do a full review later, too tired to think and type inteligent like at the moment. one thing i will say is this, the female lead, Ornella Muti, was ridiculously good looking. according to her  urlLink imdb profile  shes part italian and part estonian and shes also damn near fifty. she is a ten, easily. if she were an amp she'd go to eleven. her perfect breasts hypnotically pulled my attention away from anything else that may have been occurring in scene. i googled here and there were some nice pics of her in the image search, some nekkid even, but none truly give justice to what i saw on the big screen. apparently she was in flash gordon back in the day. FLASH!!!  WHOA  OOOHHH!!! DEFENDEROFTHEUNIVERSE!!! Also imdb says she was named the most beautiful woman in the world in some euro mag in the mid nineties, no surprise there.

      Last week, thursdat or friday i think, i was telling howard about more early morning adventures running a red light, then realizing a cop was waiting at the adjacent light, then pretending to be sliding slightly out of control when i saw him, and getting away with it cleanly. the cop even turned on to the block i was driving too. clearly he didnt give a damn, but even still, not the typ of thing id like to try twice. well the pessimists that we are we came to the realization that i would be getting some sort of karmic retribution.  well karma came a knockin today, and he wasnt bringing presents.  i drove around for an hour this morning looking for a spot, on a normal bad day it takes about 15 mins. plus the spot was like 5 blocks away from the train station and in a shady neighborhood.  then i almost spilled my coffee on my laptop. then i decided to spend about six hours, including an hour and a half on the horn with an indian tech guy i could only understand about half the time, on a problem that i finally solved on my own in about ten minutes. And...damn do i sound like a bitch. Ill stop now.  At least the grammys didnt suck much.  Prince and beyonce was solid, even QT showed up givin purple rain props.  Loved the big funky medley with rev sam jackson. black eyed peas were cool and so was the Foo Fighters and Chick Korea.  beatles and zevon tribs were not as cool as they could have been. seriously sting, we know you got the pipes, but there were 2 other dudes who were trying to get a couple words in too.  Am i going to have to get a marbury jersey. the last knick jersey i had was a mark jackson from back in the day, and really only john starks ever came close to making me throw down the scratch.  last night during the fourth quarter i almost walked out of my house and drove right to modells.  im going to watch one of my fav firefly eps now, thatll get me going in the right direction. good night now

      One more interesting note about going to the movies yesterday.  I saw a trailer for the weirdest movie ever.  There were a bunch of weird indy trailers, but this one out does them all. The craziest image in the trailer is seeing the guy dancing with his doll.  urlLink Love Object .

      So i saw On the Run last night.  Interesting movie.  Im extremeley curious how part 2 and 3 will connect with this first installment.  my opinion of this movie has been a rollercoaster of sorts.  Watching the movie, specifically up until the final 5 minutes i liked it alot.  but after the final 5 minutes i was confused to the point of being upset. people in the theater, an indy theater with an indy crowd, audibly started to laugh, uncomfortably, at the absurdity of the last 5 minutes of this movie.  And finaly on the train ride home, i came to the conclusion that it wasnt as far fetched an ending as i first maigt have envisioned. But first things first.  This part one of a trilogy of three related films, each in a diff genre, is about a guy, played by Lucas Belveau (also the writer and director), who breaks out of prison and is, well, on the run.  But he has the specific goal of pulling off some heinous terrorist acts and offing some big biz guy that aparently did him wrong.  He kills and blows stuff up so hes a bad guy.  He cares for a woman he hardly knows that is jonesing for a fix and then keeps her from dying when it turns out she gets some bad stuff.  Also he receives help from a woman who obviously at one point cared very much for this guy.  The movie is at one view pretty standard fare for the genre story and character wise.  The ending pretty much calls for a senseless death for the character.( Falling Down comes to mind as one flick that sets up a vaguely similar situation)  What makes this movie a good movie is the acting, the style and feel and the prospects of it fitting into a greater whole.    The actors were top notch.  I sorta have a hard time criticizing actor performances.  I feel it rings hollow when i start talking about that type of thing, but i deff know a bad performance when i see one.  but the acting had me beleiving in the stories and situations and i guess thats all that needs to be done when it comes down to it.  The style and feel of the film is what makes this one special.  Being an american, i am completely numb to guns and gunshots in the movies.  but the interesting thing about this movie is that when a shot was fired i nearly jumped out of my pumas.  it was combo of sound tricks and editing and it was quite effective as shot were fired with little to no notice.  Overall the movie was gritty. the gun play wasnt pretty it was ugly and mean.  As for its role in the trilogy and its connections to the next 2 parts, cant tell yet, but im deff interested to see the next flick.  Now ill deal with the final five minutes of this film.  Its a spoiler if you want to be surprised by the ending, but everyone who was in the theater with me and was surprised by the ending, seemed pretty dissapointed.  Here we go anyway.   As i mentioned earlier, this person should die at the end, guess what, he does.  I beleive that based on the constrictions of this genre and the protagonists path he should die (if spielberg made the movie, he'd move into a house at the end with a nice garden in front and a pretty view of the ocean).  Not necessarily by the hands of a pursuer  or a friend, but something senseless and sudden.  Instead of  senseless , belveaux decides to go with  nonsensical  , and wackiness ensues.  belveaux, after committing his final criminal act, and with pursuants getting the closest he drives up into the mountains.  Then he starts hiking into said mountains until he starts getting to the snow covered parts.  Then he goes to sleep.  He clearly should be freezing to death at this point.  Then he  wakes. More trudging through snow. Trudging. Trudging.  He falls in.  Tries to pull himself up.  Doesnt. Gone. The End.  wtf.  Alright, symbolism, fine, whatever.  Its symbolic of his journey, or his failed trek toward righteousness/heaven, i get it.  but it was patently absurd when the first 100 mins or so of the movie was so naturalistic and real, and the last five mins was artsy fartsy mumbo jumbo.  im all for mixing it up, but i thought that that was the point of the trilogy itself.  i dont hate the ending as much as i did after seeing it.  i get it. make people think when they walk out of the theater. i can see that as a good thing, it was just a bit startling.    All things being said...good movie.

      how could i have forgotten.  tonight is the 100th episode of Angel.  cordy returns from a coma and net rumors of her demise are flying fast and furious.  i have no idea how she even got in a coma cuz i havent seen any season 4 and only half of season 3s eps (we're in season 5 now btw). oh tivo...sigh...she will be mine, oh yes, she will be mine. i want to see city of god especially now its getting all this oscar related run, but this french trilogy idea fascinates me.

      Is it me or has the rock community just come to a grinding halt. I understand music is a matter of taste, so im not necessarily chastising the popular styles, more like im challenge the lack of imagination.  For as much malign as the hip hop and techno communities may be garnered with due to generational misguiding and the like, i tend to think they, especially hip ho and r &b, always seem to pay respects to those  who came before and at the same time experimenting with various styles and collaborations with in the community and with those aforementioned forebearers.  One thing the supposedly flagging music industry needs to look into is diversifying. the standard style of album the exists today is about 6 generations of fans old.  nothing should be that stagnant for that long.  the future of the music biz needs to be some type of diversification. dvds are so huge now and almost overnight because they offer so much more than just the movie and better picture. a project like  urlLink Dave Grohl's Probot  is the type of interesting thing that could boost a sagging industry.  Although Probot is more for a specialized audience being that it features mostly "underground" guest spots, its more the idea of the forward thinking of a creative mind. When band venture into the studio and try to bang out 12 to 15 songs once a year` songs that rarely have any relation to one another, its too easy for things to get stale.  The thinking and the creative process is way too linear. delineation must occur for something interesting to happen. Im excited to hear Probot, but im also interested in what alot of so called talented people could do if they really put some thought into new and interesting projects.  Music ramble over.  Commensing super bowl/drive-home-to-ny hangover....now.

      So last night im minding my own bizness, continuing on the road to the nba finals with the nuggets in live 2004 when my brother calls me saying i should come watch smallville, it was already half over, but he said it was a good one. now i gave up on this show a few months ago, but i was binding my time till one of the last "fresh" Angel episodes were coming on. so i figured what the heck. i realized one of the reasons i was turned off by the show was that they were yanking the lex character around way too much, his character was developing into something interesting and they just pulled the rug out from under it, so they could do it all over again. i wasnt having any of that so i walked. what i also realized is that lex is the far more interesting character. lex luthor clearly carries the show for anybody looking for a show with an interesting story and not angsty bullshit. his insistance on loyalty to his friends (clark kent, lana lang, etc) and abhorrence of his father and his evil ways is fascinating knowing that betraying his friends and becoming his father is exactly what is in store for him.  last night a repressed memory was recovered that lex saw his mother kill his infant brother. lex took the blame knowing that his father would come down hard on his mother and not him because he was his only remaining heir. lex tells lionel (dad) this new found truth and he seems remorseful for all the shit he put lex through over the years, and of course lex will have not of it. its almost shakespearian. almost.  its too bad kent is whiny bitch or else this show might be more watchable...  speaking of watchable, angel pumped out another fine ep last night despite its lame duck status. another edlund penned script showing he is equally adept at doing drama/sci fi as he is comedy.  the foxy amy acker continues to amaze as the thouroughly bad ass illyria...her transformation from the cute and dorky fred to the playfully evil illyria is quite impressive. speaking of foxy ladies charisma carpenter, cordelia chase from angel and buffy will be in the june playboy, perusing the aintitcoolnews message boards for last weeks angel episode somebody actually had a link for it that i was about to post but it appears dead now. it didnt seem like something one would be allowed to do anyways. i'll post it any ways.  urlLink its nakedness so if your at work.... now you know, and knowing is half the battle.       ps fantsay baseball sucks out

      so im checking out the dvd properties on this laptop that i use at work. its got windows xp pro on it. sorta decked out and what not. anyways, i was prompted by tom's mention of being able to play differenet region dvds on it. so i check out the drive properties and within that there is hardware properties and within that there is a tab for dvd region. this is where i found something very disturbing. after explaining what regionalized dvds are this is what it reads:  CAUTION  You can change the region a limited number of times. After Changes remaining reaches zero, you cannot change the region even if you reinstall Windows or move your DVD drive to a different computer.  Changes remaining:4  then a whole list of countries to choose from  what the fuck is that. was that a threat. was i just threatened by inanimate hardware, or is this another of microsofts evil plans for world domination.  i think i was just threatened. the technology is clearly there for me to use, but why must it be limited.  i can understand people not wanting their programs copied and distributed, but this is something different, if anybody has insite on these gestapo esque tactics, id love to hear them. im sure there are cracks or hacks for locks like this. im not sure i even need it, im just kinda curious... and its attitudes like that, that make microsofts efforts work against them. if you lock something up, that doesnt need locking, u r just askin to get hacked. gah.

      Finally saw shaolin soccer yesterday,   legally  ...cough... liz...cough.  But seriously, you should all either come to new york and watch it with me or check out liz's bootleg cuz americans are way to slow to pick up on something like this and itll never make its way out of ny and la. it was brilliant and like six people walked out within the first 15 mins of the show that i was at. this was a ten dollar ticket and most of them had there own popcorn and soda. what kind of person walks out after making that kind of commitment?!?!  No wonder divorce has become such commonplace in ou society.  Did u not know what u were going to see.  When i bought my ticket i was told, or was it warned, that the movie had subtitles and i kind of blew the ticket person off with a look like, "what am i illiterate, who gives a shit." And i later thought how can a person who seeks this movie out not know what to expect.  It has basically had zero pub so if you even know it exists, u either saw a trailer like a year ago or u read about it somewhere, for example last weekends NY Times,where the difficulties of release and exceptence were pretty clearly laid out.  enuff about stupid people, let me just say that i loved this movie and recommend all come to new york and see it with me.  its spoof with out being too spoofy.  its got all types of visual and music cues that riff on hong kong and americas most memorable moments and styles.   its got all the great action beats but also its your basic sports movie where ragtag bunch comes together to beat the juiced up baddies, its just happens that this ragtag bunch happen to be shaolin masters each with their own specialties (iron head, iron shirt [he could hold the ball with his abs], and iron leg).  And the Bruce Lee lookalike/wannabe goalkeeper in the game of death outfit was fantastic.  the post game interview. the musical number in the bar. the dancing in the streets.  a must see for all. I wanna see this again.  what miramaz needed to do was give this a wider realease and let the local word of mouth permeate in those cities.  oh and a tv commercial or two wouldnt hurt.  you fucking advertise this flick during conan or the daily show or south park and itll do bank without a question.

      I just a got a ticket to go see Shoalin Soccer.  I was leary of spending ten bucks to see a movie thats only 87 mins long, especially one that imdb says was over 100 mins long in hong kong.  i really dont understand why miramax is pussyfooting around the release of this movie, i guess ill find out in a couple of hours.  I finally decided to go see it because i realized that in order for this film to reach other cities, other than nyc and la, people need to go see it in nyc and la. so thats what im going to do, i owe it to the people. to my people.

      First and foremost many congrats to Tom Locke joining the ranks of those in employ. Second off, though, congrats to Rage Kage 2.0 for busting out big time in last night game seven. flashes of seasons past had to be flying through his mind as the inept play of his teammates nearly brought his deserved W into an L.  Sam I Am gimping around getting whislted for an O foul and gimping the ball down the court only to give it up to christie only to foul him. not to mention hoiberg leaving the hot shooter open at the 3 line, madsen dropping easy dunk opportnuities, not once, not twice, BUT THRICE, and gary trent for brincking that layup at the end of the first half. Who won this game again? Oh yeah, KayGinsky.  Moving over to point and turning the game like he did, staving off a sacto run, while he himself was running on fumes. Just nasty.  When they brought ET in, he almost blew it (maybe one more ice bag in his shorts would have helped).  I dont think the Wolves are healthy enuff to give the lakers what they deserve, but that performance in the fourth ought to go down in history like magic sliding over to play center back in the day.  Come to think of it, Sam I am ought to sit out a game or two and rest up for the later games. Kage can handle pg duties for a while. what lake can stop him anyway.

      The other day i was thinking about how i was sorta sick of playing sports games on ps2. i dont play much but when i do its pretty much been down to madden, live and the 2k sports series games.  i was thinking id love to play a game with a long and involving story to mix things up. the last game that i really played like that was probably the noir graphic novel style max payne. great game. but that was like 3 or 4 years ago now. so today i read this review of onimusha 3 over at  urlLink the shoot  . sounds like a real cool game.  play as jean reno or a the guy from the returner and kick ass in two separate but independently cool situations. now im going about looking to find a good deal on maybe picking this baby up and i find this little  urlLink doodad , officially taking the long held prize of most ridiculous game controler, long held by the power glove for the NES, with its pad covered in around 25 buttons when the controler it was replaing only had 4. and this one will set u back a good ben and half. for that much u could buy a second system. in the end, im not sure if i should be appauled by this accesory or compelled by it.   on a related note, does anybody know where on the net or in real life a person can get a new video game at a discounted price. does such a place even exist?

       urlLink CNN.com - NBC's next hit:'Siegfried & Roy's' cats? - May 3, 2004  on what planet is this a good idea. ill give them props for bringing in quality comic talents, but funnier people have tanked on less ridiculous ideas. And shows like futurama and the family guy struggle for existance. for shame.

      So im listening to howard this morning on the way in from work and hes got fat mike from nofx and fat wreck on. basically just pimpin the new  urlLink rock against bush album . kind of a week sell, but howard is always very skeptical when it comes to music. but the basic message was something howard didnt mind getting behind. then the ex lead singer of the misfits, presently of gotham road, michael graves calls in basically trying to bully fat mike into a debate that it seems hes already made an effort to avoid. though howard stood up for fat mike, he seemed completely uninterested with the scuffle and basically said enough of that and goodbye.  On another, and completely unrelated note. I was watching the penultimate alias last night and noted something that ive noted every time i see this actress. im speaking of  urlLink isabella rosellini . whats up with her. i dont get it. is she a good actress? is she pretty? is she particulary interesing? maybe in a foreign/mysterious type a way but thats a bout it.. i just dont get isabella rosselini. there. i said it.

      so im staying in boulder. its seems like a very cool place. as for a colleg town&nbsp;it makes cp look like shanty town. foxy coeds are practically flowing from the fawcets. and with the mtns and thin air people are constantly getting&nbsp;a work out and nobody is out of shape. oops i have rock hard abs. when i got in to town 2 days ago i picked up a paper and found out that my fav nyhc band soia was playing in denver. i hadnt seen these guys in a few years and i really hadnt listened to there new album, but the coincidence was too much to pass up.&nbsp; i felt so old and out of touch at the show. but im not sure if that was completely me there was deff so weird vibes coming out of that place. it really was not meant for a hardcore show. then again there really wasnt much of a hc crowd.&nbsp; let quote my im conversation with howard cuz i dont feel like typing the description of this place again. really i should have known a place&nbsp; called the bluebird couldnt possibly be a good place for a hardcore show:   DamnRobots: what kind of place was it JDAWG 7180: it was an old converted theater, so imagine a theater and how it might have three or so levels each with five or so rows... DamnRobots: what the DamnRobots: were the seats taken out JDAWG 7180: the chairs were pulled out but instead you head 2 small platforms surrounded by guide bars and the fromnt are by the stage that went at most six people deep...thats where the week ass pit was DamnRobots: thats weird JDAWG 7180: the first band was like...err try running in circles up one set of steps and down the other JDAWG 7180: it didnt work...weird vibe... DamnRobots: hahaha JDAWG 7180: plus there were like 2 fights, pete from soia was pissed JDAWG 7180: they didnt even play an encore JDAWG 7180: somebody actually asked for a song they played already, like the second song they played DamnRobots: haha DamnRobots: lame JDAWG 7180: there was a balcony area where people could sit and drink, which was cool, but there really wasnt any body cool downstairs...strange vibe JDAWG 7180: i hung out there for the first band, but one 2.50 pbr can is enuff for me DamnRobots: its a classy place when they have cans  the hives were playing like 3 blocks up the road. maybe i shouldve went to see them instead.   yesterday wasnt much of an outdoors day, i also went to see Anchorman. good movie. me in tears with laughter is usually a good sign.&nbsp; i would just like to put this out here, not a spoiler, but this movie contains several cameos but one cameo should be the cameo to end all cameos. ill leave it at that.  afternoon game at coors field today. cant wait. rockies v dodgers. cant wait.&nbsp; cya when i cya.

      last time i posted i had just arrived in the lou.&nbsp; after leaving starbucks i found the hostel i was staying and what a shit hole it was. i dropped&nbsp;my car off and found the closest bar to drink myself into&nbsp;believing it wasnt so bad. although the local flavor was nice and the cute bartender and i bonded, it didnt work. i was on the top bunk of a creaky bed, it was super hot with no&nbsp;AC and both my roommates snored like lawnmowers. i wound up wandering the streets&nbsp;at like 2 in the morning. i went to bed around 11.&nbsp; so with the&nbsp;2 or so&nbsp;hours of sleep i embarked on quite a day on friday.&nbsp; ill keep it short and less rambly but i went to the arch, the anheuser busch factory an baseball game. better yet why dont i show you.&nbsp;

      chicago is great but i did it all wrong. it cost me too much to park, i was all worried if all the stuff in my car would be stolen. i did it all wrong and i was all flustered so i didnt enjoy as much as i could.&nbsp; the hostel i stayed in though was in an amazing location and it teetered on the line between the greatest hostel ever and the worst hotel ever. in the end though if a group of us were to get together and find a good deal for a&nbsp;clight or a train or something, this place would be perfect.&nbsp; from my window where i&nbsp;slept i&nbsp;could almost have touched the el if i opened the window&nbsp;although it barely bothered me noise wise and the bed shake was zero.&nbsp;looking across the&nbsp;tracks though i could swear i saw a couple guys in fedoras, the skinny one&nbsp;making dry white toast over a hotplate.  yesterday i didnt feel like driving much but i really felt like i had to get out of chi town. there were some seriously bad vibes in town when i got there.&nbsp;cubs&nbsp;were acting the fool and nearly played the selves out of the playoff contention in july. one cool thing i did do in chicago was 3 block away from the hostel was buddy guys blues bar.&nbsp; i had a great po boy some gumbo and a bit of a buzz on while listening to some fine local blues band before retiring for the night. good times  after leaving chicago i stopped in bloomington, illinois partway between st louis and chi town. i stayed at a motel six&nbsp;cheaper then the hostel in chitown. nice enuff room...except of course&nbsp;till the ac started getting loud and drippy so a little after midnight central time i&nbsp;changed rooms.&nbsp; whatever.  im in st lou now. around the corner from&nbsp;busch stadium in a starbucks aping a wireless connection from the hotel upstairs. i couldnt find the hostel when i got here a couple hours ago, no matter they dont open up till 6 anyways. so drove around for a while and now im her in starbucks.&nbsp; i gotta check the cards sched, maybe see them tomorow.&nbsp; ill cya when i cya.  highlit&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I wasnt able to get to the internet yesterday or today but I want to post something, ive done and seen so much over the last 48 hrs. yesterday I was in Pittsburgh. I posted within minutes of walking out the door.&nbsp; From there I went to the great state of Ohio, more specifically Canton and even more specifically the Pro Football Hall of Fame. It was cool I enjoyed it. I did the whole place in about 2 hours.&nbsp; I even took a whole bunch of pictures hopefully I can post some of them when I post this.&nbsp; The highlight was deff the actual HALL of fame where the inductees are enshrined. Those bust were quite impressive but a little on the ominous side, and Terry Bradshaw looked like he was about to cry.&nbsp; Must be that manic depression kicking in. and who chooses the look. Are they based on old pictures, do they pose for’em.&nbsp; Other smaller notes on the bust, I think somebody broke joe gibbs glasses, either that or he came and took them back when the skins rehired him and why was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wearing a jacket and tie. Has anyone ever seen that guy not in a running suit.  &nbsp;  From canton I headed north toward Akron and Cleveland. Between those 2 cities though there is the Cuyahoga Valley National Park.&nbsp; It is in this place where the hostel I found, in my Hostelers International guide, is located.

Im now off to akron ohio, which&nbsp;is perfectly placed between the rocknroll and football hofs.&nbsp; Hey that gives me an idea.&nbsp; Anyways.&nbsp; Ill cya when i cya. Out.

First stop Pittsburgh,&nbsp;PA. Im going to try and chronicle the trip on this blog to the best of my ability.&nbsp; Ive got a&nbsp;camera that ive been playing with and ive even manged to use the pictures on this site.&nbsp; Ill try and post all of the cool things i get to see.&nbsp; ill have this laptop with me and&nbsp;hopefully&nbsp;ill be able to get on the net as often as possible. &nbsp; i have few destinations in mind, but&nbsp;ive not put a time frame on my trip.&nbsp; essentially im going to hit up as many cool places as possible but also get some quality/healthy me time in as well.&nbsp; Im going to plan 1 or 2 stops ahead but not much more.&nbsp; Im going to stay in hostels and campgrounds. and im leaving tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;packing's a bitch so i better get some sleep so i can get it done in the morning.&nbsp;

      its been a few days. i am presently in a starbucks in spokane, wash.  im gonna step back a few days though and update stuff in order. first off, driggs, idaho was pretty much nowhere but it was deffinitely a cool place, because i stayed with the nicest people ever at the  urlLink Movin Sol Hostel   and because of it location to the far pricier and more tourist over run town of jackson, wyoming.  ok now lemme review some flicks: wed 8/4  urlLink Danny Deckchair : cute movie. it disapointed me because it started out as something quirky and different, but devolved into something a bit more predictable. Itd be blatant Capra-corn if it didnt take place in Australia. Human Nature's Rhys Ifans played a guy living in Sydney who lays concrete in big construcion sites and accidentally falls in, a lot. he has crazy dreams like getting away from the big city and camping outside.  sound like anyone you know. his girlfriend who he lives with is about to start cheating on him. he decides to tie a bunch of balloons to his deckchair one day when all his bloaks are over for a barbie. he starts flying away and lands a few hundred miles away in a small town and begins to get involved with LOTR's Miranda Otto. the small town atmo starts to make him happy again. its alot like a movie that everybody hated that came out a few years ago called the majestic. its capra corn w/o america.  urlLink Saints and Soldiers  : This was quality low budget filmmaking. A movie with no familiar faces or behind the scenes name talent. It was about a handful of americans barely escaping a nazi massacre who find an english paratrooper with important intel that needs to get somehwere. the characters fall into line with genre cliches, the guy from brooklyn, the devout christian, the country boy and grizzled vet. but they are convetions because when done right, they work and in this case htey do. it was true story. but in the end it was really about restoring the faith of brooklyn in god sorta but in humanity mostly.....both of these i say outside at a still active drive in, but i sat on the gross as did most people. it was pretty damn freezing by the time saints came on but held strong despite my in appropriate attire. thurs 8/5  urlLink Raiders of the Lost Ark: The Adaptation : This was interesting its only been screened twice before this festival publicly. it is also the reason i even decided to go to driggs idaho. im really not sure how to view this critically. the video and audio were pretty lowsy but the production values and the work that must of went into this thing blew me away. if u dont know what this is, ill try and be brief in my description. in '82 a year after its release 3 dorky 12 year olds got usage of a 16 mm camera and began work on a shot for shot remake of raiders of the lost ark 7 years later they were finished. and about 15 years after that it found its way into harry knowles chubby little fingers, by way of buddy cabin fevers eli roth, and on the screen at his film fest. it has all the car chases, the snakes, being dragged by a car, face melting, the kid who played indy said kissing the chick who played marion was his first ever kiss, instead of a monkey they used small dog. it was quite impressive. thats all i have to say about that i guess. but everyone aught to see it just for shits at least. friday 8/6  urlLink just a dream : i think it was banked for a possible release on showtime. directed but not starring danny glover. it was a typical coming of age story. takes place in the 50s. something about marilyn monroe. a white kid befriends a black dude, M.A.N.T.I.S.'s Carl Lumbly, who becomes a father figure. dot dot dot etc etc etc. melodrama. blah blah blah. zzzzzzz.  urlLink This is Nowhere : interesting stories from interesting people. its about folks who pack up there homes, move into rvs and see the country. also hits a little close to home. the doc itself wasnt exactly sure what it was a bout. it was a bit scatterbrained and unfocuesed. it didnt really have a story and it didnt really categorize what anybody said. and it always seemed to comeback to wal mart where many of them used instead of trailer parks which cost money. you see, wal mart is the only place that across the country consistently allows people to camp overnight in their lot. also it was too long as it seemed a bit repetive at times. i did get a free soundrack though. boss. Little Movies: back at the drive in i checked out this group of shorts. ill highlight the 3 that are worth mentioning. The first 2 were actually made by the same austrian filmmaker...  urlLink Copy Shop : Virgil Wildrich. remember the name. cause he fucking blew my mind. this first film is about this guy that wakes up and goes to work at the copy shop. its black and white. not grainy per se but deff looking worn out or something. it has a bitt of that german expressionist high angle look with the back drop of the city looking purposefully fake. he starts to zone out while making copies and then decides to copy his hand. then scenes of him getting out of bed and going to work start pop out of the copier. then all hell breaks loose as the day seems to end he goes home to bed and the waking cycle begins a new. then it hapens again and theres 2 dudes walking around. eventually becoming lots and lots of dudes. it really really cool as you slowly realize that the dirt look is basically simming photocopies flipping by. very cool. oh, and it predates the matrix sequels release by 2 years.  urlLink Fast Film : Wildrich then goes and tops Copy Shop 2 years later. big time. my description cant really do justice to this short as it basically projects dozens of classic movie moments over paper folding, oragamis type things. somehow created and pace rapidly accelerating using images of classic bogey, hitch, ford in raiders, bond, kubrick and tons more as well as this kinetic paper mimicking trains falling off a cliff, horses and fighter planes. the way this reads doesnt make any sense. it shouldnt, but he makes something work and i dont know how to properly describe it. but i loved. and its a must see for any who loves movies by any or all of the greats mentioned above and more. and the last short and last review, the reason i ventured back out into the cold.... urlLink I am Stamos : This movie was about a fat guy actor that always gut the best buddy dopey roles. he goes out for a sitcom audish and decides to tell the producer, played by BOB ROONEY FROM MARRIED WITH CHILDREN, that he wants  to play the leading man role. he gets laughed off the stage. that night at his birthday party, attended by Clint Howard as himself, he makes a wish on his candle that he looked like john stamos...one of the people Bob Rooney mentioned he needed to look like to be a star after tom cruise and george clooney. oh, and he happened to be reading an entertainment weekly with stamos on the cover. when he wakes up to get his pictures he finds out that only on camera he looks just like john stamos. he gets the lead role on this crappy sitccom about a guy running a bikini shop. meanwhile the real stamos is talking to a director who is about to give him the starring role of thomas jefferson in his movie when he learns of this 2 bit sitcom that hes starring in. flip on the telly and theres this sitcom on with stamos singing a stupid song with a goofy sidekick and making out with bikin clad babes. stamos claims its not him but they aint buying it. stamos then shows up to the studio. someone runs in and screams something along the lines of...John Stamos is here and hes pissed. so Bob Rooney and the wanna be chain themselves into the studio.  stamos smashes the doors open with an axe and wrestles his double. eventually they kill him and it devolves into a tales from the crypt as now the guy looks like stamos with a bullet hole between the eyes.  but the fun really comes in the journey.   whoa thats alot of typing in one sitting  ill wrap up real quick. after driggs i drove up to old faithful in yellowstone, stayed over night in the oldfaithful inn. next morning after that i drop up to the hot springs at the far north end of the park, spent some time there. and around 1:30 decided to make some serious progress and did nearly 400 miles and arrive in missoula, montana. slept there last night in a motel 6. just drove through the rest of montana, northern idaho and now im in spokane. i think im back at the motel 6. i havent decided yet. ill post some yellow stones picks a bit later. there are tons.  that crazy place looks like fucking mars or something.

      well...im in driggs, idaho. u may be saying to yourself something along the lines of "why?" or "whats in driggs, idaho?" or "has berger snapped and become a potato farmer?" the reason im here is actually one word. CINEMA. its the first annual  urlLink spudfest . i read about it when i got to jackson and now im here. starts today goes through the weekend. theres a few must see flicks, specifically the shot for shot remake of raiders of the lost ark by 12 year olds. i read about that one about a year ago. presently im in a place called the teton aviation warbirds cafe. a really cool little restaurant in a small private airport with a few ww2 planes on display. im looking at the back of the tetons out the window here as well as personal aircrafts and planes dragging gliders for trips over the tetons.  oh yeah, and im eating an elk burger.  it tastes like regular beef but slightly diff. i cant quite place my finger on it. oh and of course the so freshly made there still warm potato chips are dynamite .  tonight im going to try and see a movie called danny deckchair with rhys ifans and miranda otto. after that it some ww2 flick that sounds cool.  il report back when i can. this is gonna be sweet.
