      Ok so last nite wuz a fuckin good nite, the sauseateers decided to go to our good freinds (luke) 18th birthday. It wuz held in a realy funky placed named the thurso club and what makes it so funky is the price of the drinks 1.90 for a pint, yeh check that connector :D.   At the start of the nite we drank quite slowly only having 3 pints in half an hour. then came the ducky fuzz game, by that time  i ad another pint and started on jacky d  so i wuz aproaching saused pretty quickly, colin was at the same stage but kyle only ad 2 pints and was "leaving at ten"". during the wonderful game of ducky fuzz you had to say fuzzy duck or duck fuzz depend on sumthing or other when you got it wrong you ad down drink which was interesting to say the least.the nite continued and the sausateers got quite saused even kyle wuz drunk!! we also av a new sausateer tiny!!!. after 12ish things gets a tad blurry i have been told that the drink count was about 8 pints 5 aftershocks and a handful of jacky ds i think, so i cant remember much more part fae i wuz blowing chunks when i got home score!! newayz ma bed is calling me! so checkaconnecty cove cully check cough....

      Well it may b snowy, cold and whatnot but the The Summer Of The caused has begun!! Woo hoo. If all goes to plan thee sausateers with be having the opening ceremony tomorrow, in which we will be getting really badly caused. newayz biffy 'clyro - the go slow' is really good so download it   soon there will also be a toilet incidents counter, dedicated to one of our sausateers john. Nearly always he ends up finding himself in a toilet in one way or another, the best example of this is when he was excrementing in a toilet while while blowing chunks in a bath - not a pretty picture hehehe   bye bye   p.s the chronicles of sausateer colin are also being created but i like baking cakes so yeh

      2004 the year of the inflamed pineapple is here and with this realy cool year comes The Summer Of The Saused. The Summer Of The Saused is all about partying and being completly saused (drunk, stoned or anything else you can think of), which is not a bad thing realy. There are 7 and a half young adults or sausateers as they are known as in my head, these brave people are Gary Colin John Kyle Billy and last but smelly bigE (names subject to change), This website thingy will be used to record our saused adventures which may or may not happen due to memory loss. neways im off to eat pineapples    checkaconnecty :D
