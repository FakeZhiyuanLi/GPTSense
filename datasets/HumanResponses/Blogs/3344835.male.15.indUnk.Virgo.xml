       On a lighter note,the Electronics Entertainment Expo has closed its doors after a week of amazing new announcments and content.Nintend,to my opinion obviously,was definetly the best of the bunch coming up with DS,GC Zelda,Metroid Prime 2,Resi 4,Starfox...need I say more ? Sony did have MGS3 but that was it,don't mention GTA,I don't find it as gud as everyone seems to suggest for the simple reason that I,da master,feel it is bellow par and merely a re-hash of what was allready pretty shallow content. Microsoft only had Halo 2,Fable and Doom 3,the few games that actually seem to be decent compared to the constant output of crap,licensed ports available on all platforms.Nintendo should rule the console world and deserve to be praised for what they at least don't only talk about but actually deliver:innovation.All the platforms claim it is all about innovation and the games but all they do in the end is boast about how many million polygons their next console can crank up.Nintendo didn't even mention that the graphics processors in the DS were even more powerfull that the mighty N64 instead opting for innovative features such as: two screens (need I say more ? fine..),touch screen (is that not innovative),wireless multiplayer for up to 16 players up to 150 feet away (wow) and GBA compatibility.This is why I play GBA and GC,because Nintendo can deliver.Buy Nintendo,they deserve it.

       How is everyone doing ? As long as I actually start revising sometime,maybe I'll actually past these exams. Anyway,a mearned padawan of mine seems to hav given up on the radiating power of masterism and has envelopped himself in doubt and despair.We must stand by him and help him reach his ultimate goal before the end comes.And it will,in just over a month,we shall all be free peoples and some of us will leave for other horizons.I am fearing the worst and hope all u other padawans will still remain true to the light.

       It appears my other fellow padawans are facing many dilemnas along the path of becoming true masters and we shall face difficult times ahead.What with exams ahead and the Master not having learnt all the chemistry nor become very knowledgeable in studying the english language,I fear I shall have to study for sometime,which is very unlike me.However,my fellow padawans have versed much concern over their future but my mind is clouded by the dark side and I can see nothing. On another note,a fellow polish padawan I fear has fallen to the dark side of the force and nothing can save him now.Let his soul rest in peace. Till I post again...

       Yo everybody out there,the master has finally got round to creating his own blog man,how cool is that. I have done so in order to convey my masterism to the rest of you in the most accessible of ways.I have also decided to do this because one of my fellow padawans who is very learned with the ways of masterism,has suffered great pains this day and to show that we shall not fail to support him to being a true master.He shall then be able to receive what he was fought long and hard to achieve.Now,my fellow learners,begins the tutorial in Masterism to become a true Master as I have so often been labelled. Till I post again....

       ..Da Master is back,again after 2 weeks absence sorry about this but now im back on track.My sis,o so lowly sis,was on the internet for more than 50 hours in less than 3 days!!!I hope no more needs to be said as to why my presence has not graced my bloy for some time.But now im back and all will be remastered. So,how have anyones holidays been for the moment ? I have to say,I am a pissed off having only got pissed once sinced the end of exams which isn't a good record after a whole weeks off.However,if anyone is going to have/got to a party with booze,feel free to reply so that I can have a bit more fun and just chill out more.tte I also recommend anyone go see Shrek 2,brilliant film just as good as the first,if not better!!!
