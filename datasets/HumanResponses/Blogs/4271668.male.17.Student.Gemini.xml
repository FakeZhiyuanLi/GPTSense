      Hey. I'm in a great mood today. I think I am finally over my love. I still want to be with her but I'm not so utterly depressed anymore. Last night I had a dream that I could remember which is quite a feet for me. It was about an older me on a realy realy fast train with a very attractive blonde sitting next to me very scared. She eventualy falls asleep on me and that's when I wake up. I'm not so sure why I'm writing my dreams down now but like I said dreams that I can remember don't happen very often. I also start going back into school today. I'm meeting with a few teachers and my councelor. I have been veging almost all summer and I am ready to get back to school. Well I beter get going I don't have much time before I have to leave. Well bye for now.

      Today I am happy. My luck hasn't changed with my love but it doesn't seem like I'll never get over her anymore. Don't get me wrong I still miss her amazingly but I'm going to trust her judgment. She will always have a special place in my heart but I don't think that she completely holds it anymore. I just hope my mood stays the same today as it has started off. Well I'm going to get my day started. Bye for now.

      I feel as though I'm going insane.  Why would God have created love when all I can see it doing is causing pain.  I hate to see her in pain.  She says every guy she has ever trusted has hurt her.  I know I have and I don't know if I will ever be able to forgive myself.  I am not worthy of her.  Now she likes another guy.  If he will make her happy I suport him completely.  But I keep on thinking that there is no way that he will love her as much as I do.  I know that I am suposed to get over her, I wish I could.  I am completely broke.  I have no money to spend on anything.  Even if I thought that I would stand a chance with her I couldn't have done it due to lack of funds.  I still dream about her, but it's not like what you think.  I dream about her saying that she loves me, or just us holding hands, even our wedding.  I know that none of these dreams will come true.  I wish with all my might that they would but I know they won't.  Bye for now.

      My summer is going great.  Normaly if I was doing what I have been doing I would have been bored out of my mind.  This year is different for some reason.  All I seem to want to do is veg.  Tonight I went to see AVP it was great.  The worst thing is I thought I saw my loves car out in the parking lot.  I was worried out of my mind about what I would do if I saw her.  I would have probably ran for some reason.  In the movie "The Village" one of the leads was affraid to do what he wanted most.  I feel like him, I am too affraid to approch her but it pains me that I won't.  Well I better get back to vegging, goodnight.

      Why does a person always just want to ignore thier problems or complain about them but never fix them?  I suffer from this problem extreamly as well as most people I know.  People would rather give up then fight for what they want.  I will never reveal my loves name but I want her back more then almost anything. But even this isn't a thing to get her back to tell you the truth I don't want her to read this.  It is open to everyone else but she is the reason I started this.  I need to get her out of my head that is why after I write anything on this blog I will never read it again.  She said that she loved me but that it is over now.  How can it be over and I am still feeling this way.  I am constantly distracted by thoughts of how to win her back, each one more desperate then the last.  I've wanted to be completely honest with her but I have never realy been, I have kept every promise that I could without reveling my past and told truths whenever possable other then when it would give her an idea of who I used to be.  I don't know if I have ever forgiven myself for the sins I commited when younger, but my bigest fear was that she wouldn't.  When I gave up my last life I swore that I would never reveal it to anybody and so far I have kept to that promise.  I have told alot of stuff but not all of it.  Nothing that would comprimise anybody else.  Now I wish I had.  I hate every half truth and lie I told her.  I remember every one and I can't seem to forgive myself.  I keep on thinking "maybe if I told her everything would be different".  She says she hates herself.  I can't help but to blame myself.  The thing I want the very most in life is for her to be happy.  When we got back together for the last few days she said that she thought that she would be happy with me.  I don't know if I believed that.  I hurt her because my past came back and bit me in the ass.  I still haven't told her the real reason.  And I don't know if I should.  Tell one lie to keep another, I don't know what I should do.  Right about now I'm ready to do somthing but I don't know what.

      Why can't I allow myself to have fun. This morning my little brother called and asked if I wanted to do something with him today. I said I was busy. I could have made time for him but I'm just in a miserable mood that I don't know how to want to get out of. Sometimes I wish that I could control if I was in love or not. It hurts so much when you love a person and lose their love. I'm not talking with her. I figure that she will like to get on with her life and that I will need the chance to forget about her so I can do well at school this year. I'm not so sure anymore that I care. The only thing going through my mind right now is thoughts about how to get her back. The thing that hurts the most is that I know that none of them will work. I worry about her, she hates herself right now and she won't tell me why. I have hurt her in the past and she says that she has forgiven me but I don't know if she has. But maybe that is just me not forgiving myself for what I've done but I don't know.

      My life is great and yet I'm never pleased.  Why is it that people are so preocupied with thier own problems that they can't even contemplate other's feelings.  Why is it that I can't see what is going good in my life when anything bad is going on.  Somtimes I wish that nothing ever changed, that everything would always be the same and we would have no pain or sorrow. But then I realise that we would have no excitement or happyness.  This Blog might not be all about the thoughts that apply to other people but more about me geting my thoughts out of my head and onto paper.  Yesterday when I broke up with my girlfriend I thought that it would be easier then to try to make a long distance relationship work.  I'm not so sure that this is true.  Even with the good news that my little brother, who I've missed so much for years, decided to move into my dad's house I couldn't stop thinking of my own plight with love.  I was the happiest I've ever been with her and I'm not so sure right now that I will ever be that happy again.  I wish that I wasn't so young so that I could go with her.  She wouldn't be happy with me not finishing highschool.  I would give up anything to see her just for another second.  I've decided I'm not going to follow my dream of military flying.  I've wanted to be a fighter pilot since I was five but I just want another chance with her more then that.  Well that's enough thinking for tonight I think I'm going to bed.  Goodnight.
