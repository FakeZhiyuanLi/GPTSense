      God am I busy… there is so much I want to write about today too. Oh well, priorities. I need the time it would let me write one of my long boring posts to re-write my thesis proposal.

      I just wanna live a normal life…  We had a good game of soccer yesterday. We played from 3:30 to 6:00 and by that time the sun was down and it was already too dark to play. When we first got there, we tried asking the local club if they wanted to play, but they were a club… clubs are meant to keep other people out not to organize and get people to join: is the context of this club.  It didn’t ruin our game though, we played with four of the local high-school kids. They were Ryan, Vladimir, Eman and Andrew… I think that was his name. Well we played four on four ground balls, I stopped playing mid way cause the pizza I ate was still making its way down to my lower intestines. Rico Arrives just in time to sub for me so I took the chance to relax and let it all go down.   Before my mom complained that I didn’t see my grandfather anymore… I audibly declared that, that statement was false and that I’ve missed a whole month already and grand-dad didn’t not only care whenever I was around but he was happier when my bitch of an older sister was there. With my one last remark I said “I love the old man- but he doesn’t even care.”  My dad should have reacted but I can sense that he agreed in his silence.  We watched the rundown…and it was a good movie experience. There was enough seats and we saw some other unexpected friends. Although I don’t know why some of the guys didn’t want to sit together. The reason I wanted to watch at that time and place cause I wanted to be together with them. It was kinda disheartening when I wanted to whisper a comment to certain friends, those I knew who would appreciate it were so far away. I’m sure people like the feeling when they laugh and find themselves outside the movie environment they can turn and look around to see his or her friends around or on one side.   Wala lang…  Anyway, I hoped to get a lot of things done for school today. 5 days to make all my requirements. I’m going half days this week to work on them. Without any internet access I can’t access mail and send mail to ask for other requirements and guidelines.   Right now I’m typing on my computer at work and saving it on a disk to download on the computer at home when I get out of my half day.   I feel kinda useless without internet in the my workstation… what the fuck do I show my boss that I’m researching the topics he needs when I don’t have any (again) internet… what Should I work at home… like they would allow me the hours for doing the work there… I might as well bring my computer at home since I can’t get any work done here.   And we make do, like the rest of the world.    Life in America… I shouldn’t expect much, I know I can get a job with my skills and flexibility… not to mention that I welcome manual labor since I could use the exercise and it leaves me to think while I do something else.   I just hope to have a house at the lower middle class areas, or even the lower class housing areas. I’ll save up for bunk beds and I’ll try to get some space savers so that I can accommodate staying friends. The three brothers, their little sister and friends who need a place to stay and for as long as we can keep them.   The simpler the better, cause It will get more complicated as we struggle to keep things together.

      Oh well… Nothing happened in Freak Night much…  I finally met len and got to talk to her face to face. Although I was preoccupied with the event so I wasn’t good company. My friend and his GF broke up last, in the event he held.   Talk about timing.   I was again powerless to help and my guard was up.  I saw Gelo, Tommy, and Adrian.  Tommy tried to corner me to talk about his character. To those who don’t know what that is like, it is much like a gay man trying to corner a strait guy to molest him- instead we have a gay mega geek trying to touch me and talk about a character and a game I don’t FUCKING CARE ABOUT.   Buster bailed on me… gamers code: ”When mega geeks arrive, its every gamer for himself”.   So what I did was the simplest and most logical:  	MEGA: “ My character is etc. etc.” 	ME: “Sorry I don’t know what your talking about.” 	MEGA: “No its like this… etc. etc.” 	ME: “ You don’t understand… I don’t know what you are talking about!” with my hand up in defiance. 	MEGA: “ Well its like this…” 	ME: “ I have to go inside to check on (friend)” 	MEGA: “bla bla bla…”  	Yes that’s how they are… I wanted to shout out: “YOU KNOW YOU CAN STILL BE NORMAL AND BE A GAMER… IT Doesn’t MEAN THAT IF I GAME I’m A GEEK”  	Gelo and his minions were making a ruckus while Adrian was running a game. I “Shushed” him and said “there is a game.”   	Irony is that GELO before we started avoiding him used to embarrass people by doing just that. Now that he has gone to the deep and disgusting… well I’m happy to return the favor.  	“THAT’S FOR REPRIMANDIN ME FOR CALLING THE foot and pound system the English system and not the IMPERIAL SYSTEM which the idiot corrected me with”  	For the record: “YOU MORON!!! You can’t go around correcting people just to feel superior when all your friends left you and you’re licking and sucking the mega-*dork’s purple head just get a ride!!!   	*Dork is whale dick. 	 	Take that fucker!!! 	 	Oh yeah sorry Chompin’ChewingChabaChatty :)

      This blog may sound weird to anybody who reads it. Simply cause it is. I’m neither trying to be a philosopher nor a whiner. I happy that only the people who matter read this from time to time and it would hardly be a title nor layout that would stand out.  Appearance  Appearance is always important. It is the measure by which we place anyone who comes into our sights. How beautiful or How handsome someone is will always add to the weight of their character despite the matter that it shouldn’t.  Appearance is much like wealth in the sense that it will open doors, turn heads and determine if you are good or evil.   Another of my insecurities is appearance.   Whose mother always says their beautiful or Handsome? I’m sure a lot of us get this compliment from our parents. Among friends, we get a better gauge of how we look, I mean real friends, not those who would give you a handjob so that you’ll do the same for them.   It dawn on me one day how I really looked like. It takes a while to have an accurate image of one’s self when opinions can vary in accuracy.   When I reached that realization, I couldn’t recognize who was that person I was looking at. I really felt that, literally. BUT I knew where I stood when I’m ever gauged with a bunch of other guys. No illusions, just hard and in your face truth.   I also realized that a person’s face has so much to do with what kind of person they are. When this evil evil dork is compared to me… he is a better looking man flat out. I mean this is a guy who is against my moral and ethical fabric and women swoon over this guy.   Hell, he asks them to sleep with them behind his GF’s back. They know he has a GF, but he also has brains and cunning. He’s is (I do admit) a cunning liar, but not cunning enough for me and the guys, but cunning enough for girls 2-5 years younger (of course he chooses his prey to be the weakest and most gullible I said he was cunning didn’t I).   And this guy is better looking than me… HA!!!!  Women who can’t see through that deserve this creature. (ok that was mean and I don’t realy mean that, but I sure feel like it).  He he…   Truth be told if you ask me point blank about what I like my ideal woman I’ll lie.   When I say it here… honestly and with out any bull shit… my answer.  I want a woman whose eyes I can see in the children I will never father.   HAHA!!!  Yeah! Sweet. That’s the truth.   I have an issue with looks…. YeAH  like who doesn’t….  When I think of eating issues I think of…  Chocochaty, Chippychocochay, ChompchompChatChicharonChatty…    Its funny cause she lists down what she eats and it freaks me out, and freaks me out cause I eat thrice as much and still hold a 135lbs at 5’9”.   YABANG KO NO!   (im lucky she doesn’t read this post. He he…)  I watched south park’s Fellowship of the LOTR. It was sooo fucking funny… I love southpark and derogatory humor in general. If you get to know me you’ll see that side, when I start teasing. Its infectious cause I got that sense of humor from Kezo and if you find me funny, kezo will slay you.   Short anecdote:  Justin-“henry, I couldn’t believe it. It was the best date in my life and she just texted and texted someone the whole time we were together. I guess she didn’t find that much of a date”  Herny “ Aw c’mon its not that bad, she laughed at your jokes right?”  Justin “Yeah, I mean I really made her laugh but when we were eating and I tried to talke she would be just texting and I would find myself just waiting like a obedient lapdog”  Henry “Naku! You should have told her ‘hey I bought your food and I’m taking you out! Its JUSTIN TIME! ITS JUSTIN TIME’” he made a high whinny voice while an expression of a baby having a tantrum.   I just laughed my head of…  Justin “ I even sent a two page letter of how much I liked her, that was stupid, hopefully its to long for her and she might be intimidated to read”  Henry “ Ikaw ha pa 2 page letter kappa, baka she really likes you and you just closed the door to soon.” 	“She could be going “’I don’t want to make the first move cause he will think I’m easy… why, why did he send this letter what does this mean? Oh no Justin doesn’t like me anymore” in a silly voice.  	OK that is torture to a guy like me, I am not a violent man but I could almost not restrain myself and kill the bastard the chance I got. Giving someone hope despite how silly it may sound wears down a person’s defenses and eventually gets to them. I found it so funny as welll cause he had to know me pretty well to know that it would get to me.   	BTW in the end… the girl really didn’t like me and found me too weird. (I really have to keep telling myself this cause Kezo’s voice echoes in my head)   	Although up to now, henry still plays that joke and still makes me want to kill him.   	People really have a hard time getting over failures in general, knowing how to  bring that out in a terrible way (or funny way) has mixed consequences. In the end I got mostly over it, in fact I found myself putting her down from the pedestal cause the “Justin time” gag was so petty I understood how much she must have gone out with me out of pity.   	Despite my integrity… Pity gave me a date… I will not be ungrateful.

      The world doesn’t have a need for real knights.  I came to a realization that no one wants a protector. I have always aspired to be a knight, a paladin. I always wanted to die trying to work for some greater good, but living here in the Philippines is so disheartening and the experiences I have gone through so terrible: I wish I was just an average guy in order to fear it and avoid it or be unable to notice it.   My dad always forced me to look at people who suffer, he always pointed it out to me when we moved around the metropolis. He burned the image in me and would not let me ever forget it. You know why? Its because my father was one of them before. My dad was a child who worked for a living and had a hard life.  All his schoolmates in St. John would tell me about how my dad would be absent from school just to help out in my lolo’s store. My grandfather was a lechon-ero with six kids. My dad was the oldest and was put to work very early. They were a struggling family and the effort my dad put when he was little gave my grandparents enough reason to put him through college. He took commerce and finished it but never took the CPA exam. Every time I visit buster in his office I pass by my dad’s picture of batch 72, in DLSU main.    He married a lower middle class woman- my mom. And they drove on my dad’s bike all the way to bagio for their honeymoon. We converted one of my grandfather’s pigfarms into the house we have in sanjuan… where I grew up.   All my dad wanted is that we don’t go through the rough life he went through. He was a classic story of a poor and simple man who became rich.  My mom was a hardworking and conservative woman. She was a CPA and she was meticulous with the details of our lives. Together they raised five children and went through two miscarriages, a premature born son (john Christopher, the youngest), and an uncle (my dad’s brother, my god father) who put the entire clan into P60 million in debt (through racketeering and stealing all of the property of my gradparents under their noses) by dying and leaving all of us to pay the bill.    My life is just as interesting/convoluted and tragic. I guess it’s a curse but maybe that’s what life is.  As for me, I see no merit in me continuing when all my efforts are for nothing. I’ve worked hard to be a good person as well as a successful person, but what strikes me silly is the fact that people like me can’t make a difference.   The difference that I’m talking about is…   If you see someone using someone else what do you do?  The pig will save the victim and punish the user. If it was only that simple.   I came to realize that paladins don’t deserve to live here in this age and these people. At least in America I’d find fellow knights and protect people, so that that evil will never find its way to where I make my home.   Why don’t I just say it!  I don’t ever want to have kids, a wife, or a “relationship”. If the world will continue to screw itself up I don’t want to let my progeny be part of it.   If I had money I’d have a vasectomy.   I so lucky I'm ugly, sarcastic, and mean... it just makes this vow alot easier to follow with.

      July for kings: Normal Life    I want that to happen as bad as any ordinary guy but there are other things I have to do and may never get around to it. The three brothers may never get married or continue the line… pity.   Robin keeps telling that if I wanted the world to be a better place, the good people should be having the children and all those jerks should be the one too busy with their antics to reproduce.   I used to be the guy in high school who played kuya to all the grade school batches. I wanted to have kids of my own and find a way to be a parent without being harsh. I learned how to be funny in college, and how to use it to get around a lot of the things people usually use force for. I learned it from Kezo, he’s a preschool teacher. Buster taught me to always seek solutions without the use of force or temper.   “ Ikaw! Go to the corner!” was his reaction when his girlfriend didn’t finish her food or was about to overspend. .    I don’t need the 48 laws of power for that. Which btw I find to be a book my very fabric is against. If you don’t know the book just look at the table of contents. A book with a chapter about using friends is a book that should be burned. I don’t know why people want to use other people… to go out of their way and learn it from a book is twisted. I don’t feel comfortable around people who read that book. I can’t tell if their trying to use me, talking advantage of my generosity, being fake or plan to use me in the future.   BTW I know enough people who read the book and that’s their bible. Talk about sheep in a pack of wolves.

      I am one lonely pig.  I’ve been through a lot relative to the people around me. I was part of a love triangle that lasted a year, I had rip-roaring roller coaster ride relationship, I had a fling, I’ve gotten into bloody fights, matched wits with people who wanted to manipulate me and use me for their own ends, I’ve studied in UP (that sums up a lot), I come from the most expensive private Filipino school in the country which happens to be one of the most screwed up (both ethically and morally) places to ever send your child, I have been emotionally crushed into a thousand pieces and had to pick up every piece (with the help of true friends), and most of all I’m still alive when death was at my door (in an experience no one would believe if I mentioned it).   in the end… a man becomes bitter, a boy learns to hate, a child grows tired of crying, and I’m born again.   I learned to pray and not expect anything, I learned to fight, lose and stand up again, I learned that magic exists in a way only our experience can sense.  I’m one lonely pig… then again misery is company.   (Below my imagination having fun- the equivalent of a boy making airplane noises and stretching his arms out while running around in circles)  ~ The swords man runs into the shadows, his coat fluttering against his speed, his hands hidden gloved in black and move like a blur. His footsteps thunder through the empty and dark passageways. Five shadows move towards him. from the corner of his one eye he sees the gleam of metal.   His eye blinks. The feel of leather gloves on the grip of two pounds of long balanced steel. They are a pair of synchronized steel that moves quickly and with out thought. It felt like writing his signature.  The technique was good but the five obstacles left him one bleeding wound. The sound of his own foot steps begin to fade as the hall way opens up to an enormous room, the size to fit a house. He reacts to some movement far into the shadows, he almost stumbles and dives into the corner as gunfire becomes deafening.   	“fuck”   The Second king steps into a room, with no ammo left, no explosives, just his manobo blade, as thrity crazies were strategically left to guard. .   The crazies are men of desperation and with no means given food and a security for their families as they let themselves become subject to locally made steroids and months of brainwashing to make the ultimate loyal and obedient brutes. It’s the Philippines how hard is it to find enough desperate and miserable people.   The all looked like professional body builders except for the imbalanced proportions and the scarring from the torture. They are shorter than the 2nd king, at 5’6” and weighing in no less than 280 they were an awesome sight to any warrior. Armored with cheep Kevlar and hand-made junk breastplates they reminded gaspar of American football armor. But it was gray steel and patched up Kevlar.  Gaspar towered over them as he stood 6’4” and weighing in 340 lbs. they were blood thirsty and with large muscled hands, gaspar knew that they only needed to pin him down and that would be his end… that’s why his battle armor is equipped with enough current to light up a whole floor makati office for an hour. he can finish it in a minute (give or take).   The smell of burning flesh and the cooked portions that stuck to his metal armor made the prepared experience more than memorable. Thirty crazies attempted to dog pile him, but his position at the door would not let more than two come close, he swung away, hacking through men the size of cows. The blood that spread on the floor paralyzed half of them and killed his battery in one explosive discharge. He stepped up on to pairs of writhing masses and swung the blade, cutting two to four of them at a time, giving them sweet mercy.   Melchior had other plans, but they all had to wait when the triad’s favorite sons walked casually towards him. A twisted expression of humor and disbelieve came over him.   	“The Yangs… Fuck”  Tall and Handsome Chinese bothers, he counts three. All proficient with 10 years of serious martial arts training. But there was one important detail they all missed out.   	What is 10 years of training with masters when you still looks so pretty, mastery means pain, pain means scarring and irreparable damage. They were great fighters, even world class. But the world today has forgotten what the world before learned to well: you don’t look pretty when you fight at the cost of your life.   	“I finally fight the pussy boys… God must love me.”  	(to be continued if I care to… cause I can already imagine how the fight will end.)

      Woke up at 7:30, 7:35. 7:40, 7:45, 7:50… 9:10 am.  I kept pressing the snooze button on my phone.   I should stop doing that, but thankfully work doesn't really need me today since I submitted my story board and I'm trying to catch up in my school work.   -Melchior-  Well I spend most of last night trying to fix melchior's picture. I did a pretty good job but I far from finished… I have to go through yahoo to find any suitable clothing to add on him and other elements that would make him look like my character's magically talented brother.   -Comment Page-  I got to chat with him yesterday. I keep forgetting to ask how to find that Halo place where I can add a comment section. I wish there was a way for me to know if anybody visits this place…   Ho hum.   -Dream-  Today I was I dreamed I was another person altogether. I dreamed I had different problems. I dreamed I was another person with other strengths and skills and with different people. I was still a guy but I was talking to people who I know but had no relation to me in real life. It was like living someone else's life.  Strangely I was physically the same. Nothing much had changed except for the circumstance around me.  -Ton-  He dropped by last night, I let him stay over till traffic smoothened over. We talked about games and food to kill the time. He told me he might not pass by tomorrow cause of some event or something.  -Greetings-  Happy birthday Li Sin :) have a great rest of the year :P

      I wore blue jeans today…   A trimester ago I wore shorts every day… Yes I had hairy legs and wore shorts to show to the world my unsightly male-ness. My clothes would be: baggy shorts (earth tones), my dad’s old short sleeved Polos (he during the 70s with a rustic feel, again earthen tones) they, and hiking shoes with back or green socks. I still had my long hair, mustache and goatee.   I miss that look… I could give this look that intimidated anybody who came across it. But my parents hated it so much that when I cut it off for my OJT they opened all these doors for me…    Then my recent change…  Wearing nice P200 polo, slacks and a 2”x3” cut.   Fuck… People can recognize me. I avoided so many people that it became a great disguise… now I look like… a wimp.    I wait for the day Melchior gets back from the states and then we could practice our swordsmanship again. BobbyN told us that there is a real armsmen organization. After honing my skill I’ll join and maybe… just maybe…  Have the courage to go to the Agusan valley and be able to gain the title of bagani (bloodlessly) that would be so cool.    Time to go home

      I’ve just confirmed my suspicion many of the people who like the rav4 don’t know how to drive. Ha ha ha!!! I found its so funny that my office mate asked me why was I so amused.   It was when I was driving my family to megamall and at 12 the traffic was so terrible. When we looked at the parking lot by the podium we couldn’t see any open space. Then my little sister saw the a rav 4, Gaspar saw it as well and pointed out how it occupied two spaces… I mentioned out loud that “people who like the rav4 don’t know how to drive” its funny cause I read this girls journal and she like the rav4… when she started driving. Well, as a note to all those who might buy one remember that a rav4 is a bigger gas guzzler than a 2-door pajero. It costs me 100 pesos for 50 km on the pajero, where its 60km out of the city, you’ll get maybe 40km from the rav4. It looks nice… but you all know the saying…”you cant tell a bo…”       when I was younger I suffered a slight form of a slight split personality. I was talking to myself a lot and always had two distinct opinions about almost everything. They were so contradictory that I found myself in constant argument and began to see things in two different perspectives. There is a constant conversation going on in my head when certain ideas formed… different ideas and different methodologies came up. When I was young… I supposedly had eidetic memory… I was diagnosed this when my parents sent me to psychologist wondering why I failed in my subjects often…   I guess perspectives gets screwed up if you remember two POV on everything you ever experienced. I don’t see my superior memory at work now… god knows I’d forget my pants if the breeze didn’t remind me I needed it.   I don’t remember when this episode of my life ended but I know when I dream… there are always different versions of me that fill the roles in the dreams. Some strong, others cowardly, others pathetic and some tragic.   I had a dream when I was a priest. Could you believe that, me a priest:) I’m not even catholic.

      I have eaten a hearty breakfast and have seemed to recover from last night's relapse.  Although it still remains that I have tons to do and very little time to do it.  I asked my prof and anybody who has downloaded the time sheets from our ojt groups to  give me any other means of getting the uploaded time sheets... My prof replies to me and replies to make another yahoo ID.   I lost a lot of respect for that guy... I was the first to get an OJT and the first to start working. Not to mention the hours I work and the common sense I must have...   I tried that approach... I have 3 yahoo IDs and there is no option for me to download the  files... and I’ve begun to loose track on  their passwords and clearance…   Neither did I get a question of what went wrong nor did I get an explanation of how to  use the friggen thing. The guys simply assumed that I didn't try again… to me that was insulting… not only is this prof so lazy to go to class, hes to lazy to do his job when we plaid 8,000pesos for the 3 unit subject of OJT.   He’s paid to help me… 8grand each student. As long as hes taking that money and shoving it up his ass he might as well help me… get the files by … either asking me what I did to find a solution or giving me back the 8grand (money not from is loose ass).   JR said he didn’t like the guy because he went to the class like a know it all and threatened everyone that if he caught them not working their dead. He said that he hated to hear people whine about how they hated their jobs and how pointless it can be… maybe, just maybe… he wasn’t really doing his job well. Maybe cause he thinks he knows it all so well he just couldn’t anticipate his students when it must be so difficult to balance that huge head on those tiny shoulders.   Ok… I gave him the benefit of the doubt despite his lack of a grounded character, that’s strike one, that stupid reply… that’s strike two… strike three… what am I gonna do. Ask him to bend over and screw himself?   Fuck what do I do then.

      I forget what my dreams are in the morning. But I could remember waiting for my phone to ring and the queue that all the feelings that have trapped me in the land of memories and aspirations will wash over me and drain away beneath my feet.   I know my limitations all to well and I know how hope can disappoint me when I put any weight in it. But it’s always about living on and finding something that we can cling to like a kite tied down to a little hand to keep it aflight against the winds.   I’m listening to Better Than Ezra and Jennifer Paige… Its quite a mix for me… one came around my high school when i only dreamed to die in the state of grace and the other during my early years in college when I was confused.   I’ve been poking around friendster again and looking at people and wondering how closed and wounded some are. I can almost sense their open bloodied wounds through the web… by how they look in their pictures, what they think they should say… how much effort they place on parts of their lives and who their friends are. I have to admit Friendster is a huge experiment in who people are and what they are or what they are trying to be.   I want to ask who they are but I can see some of them are really happy, some really hurt, some shy away like candles overwhelmed by some darkness that tangle them and hide who they really are. I find myself curious and asking why they are like this. Why is their life like this… why do they say such thing… and how can have so many thorns around them that they are so painful to even touch… what more look at.   I look back at my life and know that I am one of those anomalies. Everything around me is alien yet familiar in a part of my mind that does not want to cease to slumber. I haven’t had a chance to really learn about people until being able to see what people want to project to the outside world.  I wonder if I say too little in what I write in my profile…   Sometimes I feel my life is fleeting and that I wont live past the years I have already gone through. That one day my spirit would be too tired to even let me wake up… I read someone say she lived life as full as a 40 year old… I felt that in one point of my life… when I was so screwed up… Then sympathy kicks in, I begin to understand something I didn’t expect to learn.   I look at my close friends and I can see those lights that burn the brightest and know how inevitable their end is. Those I hold closest to me are those whose disappearing and … and may not be there as another decade passes.  Its all coming down like rain on my face as they touch my eyes and trickle down to my mouth. I can taste the salt that hides what may be the only real feeling I will ever feel in my life. If the world is as screwed up as I am then what are the chances my terrible sadness is my greatest comfort.   I wonder sometimes when I walk alone in places that don’t know me and places that have already passed their judgment on me. So many people have been hurt… reality hurts but we don’t blame circumstance. We take it to our breast, walk away where no one else can see us and then we let it all go. We let go of what wounds our hands, that pierces flesh, and freezes our grip tight. When we let go… the warmth of tears fall to comfort us and the sun will rise for us. The sun will rise to tell use that we are still alive and that it is here for us.   When I’m alone walking through the darkened streets of makati, where light beams from passing cars and smoke and the smell rot find their way to my face to choke me with its putrid grip. I remember the dreams where I  run alone, running though empty streets and feel the comfort of isolation and never bothering with all the negative feelings that wrack the back of my mind.    I’m clumsy… when I’m clumsy everything slows down to moments and seconds that my mind records and absorbs the way a parched mouth drinks water. Aching detail and madness from the color and movement. Color so painful I would love to take it and break it on the floor and watch my blood flow down from my thin arms and bony fingers.  In my dreams I grit my teeth so hard they crack. Blood is in my mouth, mixing with my spit. The feeling you get when the dentist does something bloody and the pain is numbed. I swallow spit and blood. I exhale this stench and imagine my digestive system cannibalizing my blood for nutrition.    I see too many painful faces… it freaks me out and I have to say something. This is reality right?! The truth is not subjective and when I write this it is proof of the truth I feel. A part of the truth that I see and others sense as well.   I wish that when I sleep tonight my dreams take me to somewhere I can be free. In the darkness and in the intense isolation of a world void of any other person… I think I will fare well.   Being an experiment…  (JARGON FOLLOWS)  I want to be a 300cp character, 500cp even. I want to have time to master my swordsmanship… practice with my brothers the art of war and beat each other with padded sticks lose our temper and go mad with adrenaline. Twin silver blades drawn by one man… balthazar with two longblades etched with silver and a prayer to bathhala that he dies in honor and virtue. Gaspar… with his armor in black steel that reflects how shielded his mind and heart is… is far more armed by his piety and devoted nature… The plates of steel try hide the many scars and pains he bears to no avail when one looks into his dark eyes. He wields his manobo blade a mix of an axe and a scythe that can impale two men in one blow or slice the heads of a crowd with one broad sweep. Melchior has darkness and his cunning… both fueling his mind, body, and spirit. The shadows are his weapons… his keen mind hone them to blades and the gift of magic make them into physical instruments that pierce and gut those that stand in his way…  Even if we die… we die with all the courage and intensity of our passions. Enough immeasurable force and tragedy to echo through eternity the last moments of what glory we once had.  … If desires are loud enough then maybe reality can mirror them?  Of course everything above is crap cause I have a fever and I’m rambling.

      I should ask dad If I could take a leave so that I could catch up with all the work in school. I’m not feeling well doing 9-9…   My health is conspiring against me… I can’t tell my boss I’m sick again. That would be so wimpy. And there is a new project and I feel like shit. I regret taking a 9-5 job… it was a stupid mistake. If I keep at this I’ll have to repeat my thesis subject again. Maybe I should just delay it…   FUCK NO! I can’t… I was hoping for the OJT everybody else gets… the one they don’t do anything at all uselful. I wish that was my job… fuck… I feel like going into cooking even more than making storyboards that I have to approve again and again… or making them almost blindly.   I guess Its all because I feel like a relapse is coming and I can’t do anything about it.   My computer can’t connect with their’s… and I have minimal internet capability. So i can't print out what they're asking me to print out. Why the fuck did I get this job. I’ve got it all better at home compared to this… heck I wish I worked at home that way I don’t bother everyone here who have so much more important things to do that explain how things work to an intern.  Fuck… I have to run a game on Saturday and at this rate its better I turn it down cause I’ll be too sick to run a game…   Fuck I sound like a baby whining about its bottle. Sometimes I get so depressed I just wish the worse did happen that way I get it all over with and done. Its so easy to give up… I’ve already given up in this job… I just haven’t had a chance to tell my parents I want out. Maybe when its too late and I fail my thesis again.   Oh fuck… I failed it last time cause I was attempting in writing a book by myself… I’ll fail this time cause I’m trying to do this  AND finish my OJT hours.   GOD… answer my prayers and do something that would allow me to finish my project… I don’t care about the 120 hours of OJT for all I care it can go up the horse’s ass. I can do that anytime after I finish all my units… and easy. BUT the thesis… the book. I dragged someone into it already… that I can’t afford to fuck up.   If I was healthier… if I never met Joy I wouldn’t have gone through that utter rock bottom phase in my life where I starved my self to near death and lost so much sleep to dreaming and obsessing about her. Its so fucking wasted… I can almost say she single handedly ruined me…   That’s what happens when a holy-wanna-be gets a blowjob unexpectedly for his birthday. All that repression just goes crashing down on me. Fuck southridge for making me a dysfunctional male.   Rant… Rant… rant… Etc. etc. etc.  I better save the readers a reason to read this blog in the first place.   I’m fucking screwed.   It boils down to me being so pissed that I’m sick, I hated my breakfast – I’d rather starve than eat- so I ended up being so sluggish when I went to work and for getting a job when my better judgment would have been to wait.

      I saw my dad with his gray hair today. Its strange when I’m used to seeing him with darker hair. I just have a better sense how old I am relative to my dad.  I had a strange dream again… I dreamt I was in another relationship and I was being judged. It was like I was going for a girl that all these other guys were going for and I was being rated in everything I did. Cons and Pros of having the Lonely Pig as a BF. It was weird and sick. I mean sick in a disgusting way.   Although it was a funny girl, she was the type to make me laugh… which was rare. I mean I don’t meet funny girls. In fact… I haven’t met a girl equally as funny as Kezo or Wanggo. Not that it’s a great importance or anything but I just find myself wondering why.  I was at podium today and bought “The History of The Far Side” for P155 ($3) when it costs P700 ($12). Whoa hooo! Someone is getting if for Christmas so who of the guys want it call dibs its your advanced Christmas present… everyone else must expect cookies or ice cream pints of Big Scoop.   IT HAS UNPUBLISHABLE WORKS… EXTRA FAR ON THE SIDE!   My clan spent a better hour and a little bit more talking about politics. I learned that kidnappers have specializations. The abductors, the keepers, and the negotiators. So if you catch one you can’t catch them all and you will never find the master mind…  That’s unless your me and my bros… he he he… We decided on a name: We’re called the shadow kings… vigilantes who kick but and take names (drawn in blood) I have so much cool material for several SS(shadows syndicate)  adventures.   Among other things… I know what shit is going on and I’m so glad I’m leaving. The only way to save the country is… well if you read my other posts you would know.

      Freak, the underside of my eye is twitching while I write. Giving me this weird sensation of having eyebags that I don’t.   I slept early last night. I was so tired from school, I commuted and it was a hazard. No wonder the cases of TB in the Philippines is rising. I remember that I could see a clear day… some days in the week from where I live… but now I can’t see through the smog.      on a positive note…  I can’t believe Gaspar stopped playing his dynasty warriors 4 just to listen to me rave about the characters I created for us in GURPS shadow syndicate…  It’s a non-cinematic game, gritty and realistic, with one reality suspender… characters half as powerful as batman(that still is powerful). Set in this country(Philippines)… at this timeline.  To the people who live in America… the only nice thing about setting a game in the Philippines is this… The badguys get away…   With the lawlessness, rampant poverty, shameless crime lords, Triads, and Political Warlords… the Philippines is the newest unexplored setting in modern RPGs. When everybody does covert military ops… there is no covert needed in a land gripped in fear and tyranny.   BUT… the villains are cunning… don’t expect anyone you know or love to be left alive or with any dignity. Expect traitors and hypocrites on every turn, your food poisoned and your home bugged… your friends stabbing you at the back… and your money in the bank gone…  With all the real hazards of real life villains  Blathazar Gaspar Melchior  300pts. 50pts. Worth maximum disadvantages (that’s enough points for GURPS supers)  I running this after on summer next year… at least it gives me enough time to prepare after everything is done.   I’m into gritty and real not fantastic these days… Maybe when I watched the LOTR: ROTK.  …   If I redid all the Philippine heroes I wouldn’t make them look like western Icons…   1st of all DARNA… a wonderwoman rip off. I’d make her a babaylan… or a female bagani (warrior-priest-ranger-justicar) which is unheard of.   2nd Captain barbell… I’d make him the reincarnation of Bernardo carpio. With giant’s blood in his veins.. that’s why he is so strong.  3rd Zuma… I’ll keep… Hes original… I’d just make him more gruesome.    hey... maybe I'll make realistic versions of each...  Captain barbell is just a super buffed up seteriod guy . Darna... Ra'and is this cebuano chick decended from lapu-lapu... looks western because her family intermarried heavily... but she was taught the two-handed broadsword technique lapu-lapu was known for... and mastered it... Zuma is a person who just realy loves snakes and has a skin disorder...

        i won't be able to go to work today. The school has asked me to go there at around 9am and I’ll be there for quite a while finishing some of the work I have been doing. I’m planning to finish what Paco was asking me to do there while I wait and already.   If I had a computer I could be preparing the new beta system of Fate and Destiny.   I guess the school just gave the excuse for me. I guess I can now work on these things without much worry. I’ve planned to start working on the beta system. I can also work on some portraits for the characters. BUT that can wait till next week. I’m planning to finish the logo design and stuff today.   The party yesterday was nice… It was just so jerky in the sense of the flow of things… I had to eat so much rice to stop myself from getting hungry because there was a shortage of food in general and tempura.   I didn’t get to touch my mail till this morning (which is something I’ll be doing after this) and I haven’t  been able to reply the rest of the day cause I saw it as break time. I know I’ve been slacking off but the sick day was really a bad momentum stopper.   I just realized that I have done three projects the whole time I was under Cevera in just two weeks. That’s three weeks of work done in just two, I should have really taken my time.   Anyway I can finish up tomorrow.   Thankfully I can relax later… After this hard days work I’ll be going to catching up in some exercise and ending the day pretty early for my next class on Saturday which is at 9:00 meaning I have to wake up at 7:30, answer my mail and friendster at that time, and of course log into my blog.

      Well I woke up pretty late today. My  mom’s birthday and all. I don’t have work cause I’m planning to go to school. I guess life goes on.   It was unusual when things happen out of the blue.   Me, Buster and kezo were eating in MY favorite carinderia (eatery). It was late yesterday and I had been with Buster finishing our blogs. When we got there another car was parked in my favorite spot and I had to park near where some kids played. My car stuck out, but since I just got there, the owner must be leaving soon so I’ll move the car later.  There was no Heart clogging, artery chocking sisig, so I settled with Tapsilog (or fried beef cuts, fried egg, and garlic rice) I ordered my usual tokwa with it all, to my surprise kezo what eating a lot today.  I had just finished my first cup of garlic rice when I saw an opening. Manong Manny was still gonna fry a new batch of rice, so I guess I had time to kill when I went to move my car, now that the other car was gone.   So the guys already knew where I was going, not that I was going far… six steps and I’m there. I moved my car and was about to get out when I heard some one vigorously knocked at my car door. I turned to look and  saw a man and woman at near panic. The man was holding a child seemingly asleep and the woman was a large bag with several indiscernible Items roughly tucked in it.   “ dalhin mo kami sa clinic! ” the man pleaded with me. The first thing that went though my mind is… Not the value of human life, or the poor pathetic dying child, but... “Are you shitting me!?!” Not that I said it to the man, but the Philippines is know for people who abuse generosity and good nature. I was worried about my phone, which was in the jacket I left in the back seat and I was worried about the bags the guys left… which would be stolen cause of me.   BUT!… there is a slight chance that it all could be real and not a ruse. So I drove like a madman to their destination, blaring horns,  hazard lights on, and flickering headlights to get everyone’s safe attention that someone is in a desperate hurry.   On the ride I could hear someone I could guessed to be a mother mumbling and calling out what happened… “nagsusuka siya … pagkatapos hindi na bumukas ang kanyang mata …di naming alam ang gagawin… …” an excuse better saved for the doctors not me.  The man on the other hand who was sitting in the passenger seat with me, held a what seemed to be lifeless five year old. The child had very little har, not that it was cut but looked like was to young to grow hair, but it was a large child… so I assume it was a five year old. He was talking to the kid… “kaonti nalang … malapit na  ” and I could hear gurgles erupting from the kids throat.   When we got there it was a small clinic, a narrow building with a long sign parallel to it. I dropped them off and found a place to U-turn then I was back with the guys in another 4 minutes (but I couldn’t realy measure the time).    When I got back… Buster asked me what happened… I explained it in brief and asked him to check the car if their stuff is all there… and they were. I finished my extra rice and we went on our way… the event still hasn’t settled in our stomachs yet when Buster said…   “attribute it to your good deed for the day…” he jested… “balthazars getting a girlfriend… Hala!” kezo added. “Maybe there is someone you can trade in all your good deeds for a girlfriend” everyone laughed…  In the end it all was nothing… I didn't save anyone because thats the doctor's job and i just happen to be in their right place and time. I have no illusions of what happened, having witnesses an all.  I had to ask buster if I should even post it in my blog. He said of course, he said he’ll post it in his also. I just though it was too outrageous a tale to even mention.  Although one last though occurred to me… there are some jerks(with the same means as I do) out there I know and who I am strongly against that will do what I did… But I guess what makes me different is that I got witnesses. Not that there is any moral or ethical difference between the jerks I know its just they are not a danger to society (only to women og the general populace) but a danger to their friends.   Some guys are normal individuals by the standards of society… BUT they just happen to be shit to their friends.

      I was extra KSP today… I couldn’t stop about any topic that didn’t concern me. It was both annoying and embarrassing. Today I wore my suede jacket, that my dad gave me, most of the day cause I was sick.  I told my boss that I would be done with the story board by Friday (the end of the day) and he expected a high impact presentation. WOW! You fucking me!?! I’m not gonna give a freaking presentation when you just told me that you wanted a story board that I’ll be doing all the grunt work.   Well Kezo is not joining us on the way home and my mom’s birthday tomorrow.   I got Melchior’s Testimonial for me today. Cool! I mean it got me thinking cool.   I’m patriotic but I’m leaving my country. I think I’m a patriot but I have western sensibilities. I love my country but can’t stand my own countrymen.   Is life truly this complex.  I think I’m spiritual but I praise no religion. I was born and bred a catholic, but hate how inflexible some of it’s members can be and how people use it as a device for their own personal gain. I don’t want to be part of something that can be used for a selfish purpose.  In a country filled with the depressed, oppressed, and  regressed, there is always enough faith. Faith that comes from desperate men, who are cornered and have no other means to change their lives than to give in to the whims of those who wish only to use them.  Oh there I go again… ranting this rant.  I’ve decided that I will run a short horror story for October 25. The prelude would be…  Don Vicente looks out from his marble veranda towards the forested expanse. He looks to the direction of Arevalo where so much of his power and wealth flows. He tries to piece the image of the city sprawling towards his direction. It grows outward as the infrastructure and prosperity he creates feeds the land he so deeply loves.   But something else stirs in Don Vicente’s heart. There is something dark, something consuming him, and consuming this lush greenery that surrounds his magnificent home. His garden maze has turned to thorns, his wall’s choked with vines, and his servants driven mad. No one approaches this house anymore; no one visits the benevolent Don anymore. No one seems to remember him anymore.  A woman’s voice can be heard crying in the night. Calling out to anyone who would pass this majestic home. Those who have visited him recall the ancient beauty that permeates the walls of the Don Vicente’s ancestral home and its haunting magnificence.    Don Vicente holds the throne of the La Noce Mercados. They are as illusive and as secretive as their master to find. They have been those instrumental in the success of Arevalo’s sprawling business despite the marauding British Privateers that watch the bay like sharks for prey.    Fortunately Don Vicente has a friend… a dear friend indeed. A friar called Damien, Prayle Damien seeks to re-establish his contact with Don Vicente but cannot breach the dense woods that hide the path to the estate, for to deal with the La Noce Meracados one has to deal with Don Vicente.   This is when Ramon Cortez, a religious, approaches several friends to help him in return for favors and a chance to deal with the La Noce Mercados Exclusively.    … There is my primer. I hope you all can appreciate the 10 minutes I spent writing it.   Another Rant  They dare compare my thesis to ANITO… how could they compare a hack and slash RPG (Diablo engine) with my thesis! Those out there, friends, who know what I have done know how much depth and character has been placed into the setting of 1888.   Not only does it ignore the historical research I have put into the setting but also ignore what it means to be truly proud being a Filipino.   Picture a fad… and picture a milestone. What may be there for just a short instant, but one serves a purpose and a lasting mark.

      The concept of leaving the world…  I guess it isn’t anything new to many of the well to do Filipinos: the Idea of leaving the country and settling with a new life abroad. I honestly like the prospect of being able to earn a good living for what skill I have worked hard to hone and the ideas I have worked harder to keep original.   I’ve been reading about the days of Manuel Quezon and the time after America’s colonization. It was true that we didn’t need America, we were well to do and had nice things ahead of us. Its just that these days the evil that infects the country has gone out of hand and nobody can do anything about it.  Its much like the rest of the world. If there is a problem, people flee to a better place where they will be respected and will be happy. There is too much hate and too much prejudice that there will always be conflict.  The Philippines now is much like the depressing settings some people play in their games. Its oppressive and hopeless, despite what so many people try to do to help improve the situation there are those forces that have gained plenty from the ruin only to give it up to the uneducated and unenlightened masses.   The contrast is that so many people in power in the country don’t have much of an education. The fact that it is a popularity contest and a arena for giant egos has made the who country a battle field where the damage can be seen everywhere.   This is the era in the country where a powerful singular figure should rule. A powerful dictatorship that is merciless as it is threatening. It took a tyrant to break the knees of this country it would take another to get these legs forced to walk again.   There are many theories on how this country should be run. There are so many conjectures and ideas about what is wrong. I believe that all that is needed is one man to sacrifice everything… his family, his life and his very soul to save all that is living within these isles.   If a man was to attack the norm… to attack those already in power forcing them to share it… that is evil. When a man assassinates all those who have power over the lives of those wretched and hapless poor… he is evil. If he does all that is good for the sake of having the people fear him, hate him, and band together to destroy him… he is evil.   Machiavelli believed that fear is greater than respect. He is right in the context of the medieval age where everyone cared only for themselves and their wealth. The Philippines is pretty medieval… as it goes. And the greatest figures of the medieval age never were those of great pacifist character but the leaders of war.   War… a word that so many fear and dread but a necessary evil in the case of what is wrong with our country.  I used to run a game called the Shadow Syndicate.  Its all about what I just talked about. I saw how stupid some of the corrupt members of our government are since they don’t know how to hide their sins… and made villains that have used the rampart poverty and human degeneration to make a greater evil.  In the setting one will find: brainwashing camps… its pretty easy to brainwash and to condition and create real-life zealots. Not to mention create illicit resources that would allow men already in power to have underground armies.   Hiding them… that’s the tricky part and that’s what can add to the paranoia. A witness is killed by a paranoid junky… what a cover up. And nobody will ever know.   The players on the other hand are those that believe that leaving is not the answer. That this will all continue unless they make their stand now. Gifted and wealthy (legitimate) they prowl the nights hunting these powerful men at the same time maintain their anonymity.   It’s a bloody and calculating game… where this Powerful figure has his own crime lab and science lab to allow him to track down any weakness of anyone he preys upon. Businessmen and Reformists alike are targets. These villains know all the loop holes and have all this power in their disposal. What else could they do but make this country their playground.  As a father what can you do if your daughter is target of these creatures and they can drug her and kidnap her and all that you’ll get back is a naked vegetable on your doorstep.   … My brothers loved playing this game. They would be simple soldiers… who were sent into ambushes. They would survive at a terrible cost. The come home to find out that news of their death in the newspapers and their family disappearing.   Desperate men… they are powerful characters… but they are but the impetus. They need men of cunning and with the resourcefulness to wield them. Men of great character and patience, like generals of old.   They Fathers and Brothers who have lost their families in the bloodshed of politics who return to seek revenge. These are men who had the wisdom to hide their wealth far from them and to keep their families close, but still their integrity and their good nature were obstacles other more dangerous men could not compromise with.  Together they wage war… a war measured in faceless bodies and scars upon scars of hate.   Then again its just a game and who will play it when my brothers are all far away. And whats the point of playing it anyway. Its like chasing a dream that would never come close enough to the ground to touch.

      What are weird dreams all about? What do they mean? It's like one minute your dreaming about fears, the next minute passions, then old memories erupt out of nowhere like they were some old program running on a unknown queue.   I haven’t checked my mail, friendster, or phone yet today.   My last creepy though was walking down an empty old village. Much like the villages you see near UP, or around Quezon. Most of the houses were one-story and were partly made out of wood (although in the Philippines houses are made mostly of concrete). Everything was in a shade of sepia yet, or felt like a shade of sepia but I could see colors distinctly.   There was a forest in the background, dense with many old dying flowers on the floor. I could not see the past the canopy but  it felt like a august afternoon, when the rainy seasoned just started then stopped.   It was weird walking and counting all my steps to the forest. I could feel each moment pass, like they were a separate frame on a movie reel.   I got as far as the trees then I would wake up because of my fever. I wanted to continue the dream but it was to far off with my other concerns. I wonder what else was there behind the trees.  About my other concerns…   I’ll be taking a day of on Thursday to go to school and catch up with several of my projects. I don’t think I can get much done today. I itching to start turning through the pages of GURPS compendium 1 and see what magic I can work.   Its my mom’s bday on Thurs. I’ll ask her if I can celebrate it tomorrow that way I can go to the game on Thursday… To bad Dick won’t be there. I liked him as a leader cause of how Hess looked and felt as a character. I could easily imagine Johnny “boom-boom” brisco(based on bruce Campbell) taking orders from a Warrant Officer Hess (based on Michael Clark Duncan). Heck, the party as far as I’m concerned looks great. The last mission was great.   Too bad were going Arthurian next game season. I wish we went on with WH40k.   Another dream…   Its weird that when I dream of women… its usually in a harrowing situation. I would be escaping some demonic horde, I’d be in a family crisis trying to find a solution, I would be in a haunted city trying to rescue her.   Although my last two GFs left me when things got rough. I can’t blame them, I mean who wouldn’t want to leave. I would leave me If I had the chance:P  I can’t dream of romance though… I guess that sucks. I honestly don’t have a romantic bone in my body. Hey, I’m cheap(frugal) and much of a slob(ill mannered), not to mention I thrive in sarcasm and teasing remarks.   Although on rainy nights, there were some dreams that were short but really nice. There was a dream when I was in my pajamas and waking up to my kid’s cries. I was haggard from work and my “wife” lay beside me still in her bathrobes. I assumed to have fallen asleep before her, and she must have taken care of the kid then.  Then I jumped out of bed, startled, and after looking around for my glasses (more of feeling around) I went to the crib and took the little guy and went to the microwave in the kitchen and heat some milk.   It was a short dream… I remember my “wife” woke up after me and found me in the kitchen talking to the little tyke. I don’t talk baby, so I talked adult and told him how important it is not to wake up the sleeping lady.   It was to my surprise she was there, just about to fix her robes when she walked in to our conversation. Unfortunately It ended there.   Although it was just a scene, a very short scene, it was nice that my mind decided to give me a break and give me that dream. Hey I deserve good dreams now and then.    Of course there were nightmares. I don’t consider dreams where things trying to kill me a nightmare. I consider it an adventure. My idea of a nightmare is much more personal and gruesome.   My last nightmare wasn’t too long ago. It still haunts me when I think of it. It was about my grandmother and father on my mother’s side. I was particularly close to my grandparents of the staff. My grandfather was a teacher and my grandmother ran a small store at their house. My lola(grandmother) raised me with all the manners she could cram into my stubborn head and my lolo was trying to make me a scientist.   I learned the birds and the bees from my lolo when I was ten. It wasn’t about girls and boys but zygotes and reproduction.   Getting back to my dream, my I remember my grandmother was talking to me. She was telling me all her dreams for us. My grandfather sat there quietly. I remember that my grandfather had failing senses but he could feel what we all felt for each other at that time.   It was a lonely day in their house… the one in san juan. We were connected by a bridge and when we got home from school (all the way in alabang) we would go to their house and great them (by asking for their blessing, by placing their hand on our foreheads). My lola told us to always ask for blessings to greet them and at 6 o’clock.   Their room is dark and filled with old pictures and mementoes from Cotobato. It was then did I notice something strange when we sat opposite of each other. My grandfather slowly began to shrink, not in size, but it was like his skin was too big for him and his fluids began to spill to the floor. My grandmother was trying to tell us in our horror that they won’t be long. Then she began to do the same. My grandparents were melting away, actually more of rotting away before me. I couldn’t take the sight any more. That’s when I woke up to a rainy early morning, in our new home in makati.   I told Melchior about it. We all had bad feelings of something terrible lurking around the corner. I could still feel it coming, like a date unmarked on the calendar. Everyday that passes brings me unsuspectingly closer to what will happen.  Its just sad that I won’t be able to do anything great before my grandparent would be able to sense or appreciate it. My lola would always kid me that I would be rich and that I would give her money. I entertained her by telling her that If  I were rich, I’d by them a bigger house to stay in and treat them out to the best restaurants.   Man, if I had a chance. I’d buy them this rotten country and kill off all the corrupt people and re-establish it glory days of old… the time they lived they were a young family and the whole country had so much hope. When the country was reconstructing itself after the war. If I had the power I would… but then that’s a dream. Like the ones we look for when we close our eyes and try to forget the pains the day has given us. Its something fleeting and trivial, when matters such as money and compromise come up.

      Ok I bummed out instead of sleeping today, but I didn’t want to have an uneventful day of rest. If I did rest I’d be awake in the middle of the night wasting my time and being ill prepared for the next day. Oh well…  In other news… I got some of my allowance today. It is just enough to pay for gas and to buy a meal at tita su if ever Buster or Kezo are available on Wednesday. But I must remember its my mom’s birthday and I should be getting a cake for her. I was planning to get a “my little oscar” yeah its P60 pesos but I’m sure everyone will be getting something else for her. If she doesn’t like it then more cake for me:) he he…  Moving on… I will be trying to finish the following things on Tuesday…  A concept for… 	… Commercial for OJT 	… An AD campaign for my classes 	… Drawings for Paco… Which I have to ask him again what they are… 	… Re-edit my project proposal and create the GANT chart.  	… Finish some drawings  Of course I can only do two of these things tomorrow, if I do anymore I’d be pushing myself too hard…  I don’t get it. If its blood and gore… I manage to bounce right back… but when it is about getting sick, a cold or disease, a bad stomach, gas… everything dies on me. I hate that I’m weak against it…  It reminds me about gurps… Strength relates to Hit Points, While Health is about Fatigue…   I’m DONE!!! with my first play test done I have made the necessary changes in the Fate and Destiny System. I’m contented with the job of just fixing the system… BUT  I WANT TO PLAY GURPS!!! I want to play the gritty and kick but game of War hammer 40k under BobbyN. I wish Melchior and Gaspar can both play with me, the Brothers are back with cheese ozzing down our pores. Well, at least I’m running a Sci-Fi Fantasy Gothic Horror War Campaign on December. Gaspar plays a cyborg, and Melchior a version of Garret Jax (Wish song of shanara, AKA Jans steels in elfstones of shanara)   HO hum…

      I didn’t go to work today… I’m sick but feeling better. I’m in Thomas’s house and we’re waiting for Li Sin to get here. I left my phone at Giggs’ house and Thomas accompanied me to get it. We went all the way to alabang.   Last night Thomas and I were trying to pull of that trick in Maverick, where he cuts a deck of cards with one hand. We both learned two different ways to do it. There is a method of cutting it in two, the other is to cut it in the middle (drawing the middle set of cards).   Thomas mastered it quickly and I’m just following behind. Its such a cool parlor trick…  “Mr. Tan, can you please cut the cards…” 	“… Of course” The mild mannered Thomas begins to cut the cards with one hand, like it was nothing new or great with him… then he proceeded to shuffle it with both hands and then again with just one hand.   Its just cool… simple and cool.  Anyway I still have the sniffles. But no biggie…

      I’m sick… not in a funny way people would instantly quip, but in the way all of us who work(also study) dread. I will be wasting my time trying to get better while the whole world passes me by.   Being sick reminds me of Wanggo. It was back in my first months at college that I got sick… and when I get sick… I get really sick. I would look pallor and I would not be able to move from my bed. I was not only useless but pathetic. I would be coughing so much I could feel something tear and smell that metallic scent of blood when I would exhale.   Wanggo visited me… I was so shocked… I mean SO SHOCKED. I was immediately telling them that they shouldn’t be here that they had better things to do and that they would catch something. But, they were there, our maids let them in and I found myself so happy to see a visitor than I could ever be. I was so shocked cause I never had friends who would visit me when I’m sick.   Its not that we didn’t care for each other… its because we couldn’t drive and telling our parents that we were visiting our sick friend sounded too cheesy.   It was an experience that I always cherished… Infact I can still remember the time I could return the favor. Wanggo doesn’t get sick… despite that he will not take medicine nor any pill for that matter. He was one of the healthiest people I ever knew.   I remember that he looked yellow… I mean he was with a yellowish tinge. I can’t remember the details but I remember it to be the time that he told me that he never takes medicine. I just knew he’d bounce right back… he lived this long and had a life that GREAT(and I mean good + amazing + remarkable and all the positive adjectives I could fill up)… I doubted that anything could stop him.   It became my practice… that when I can I visited a friend who was sick.  It was especially true with one of my crushes. Although, she didn’t seem to appreciate it, upon hearing she was sick, I was more than glad to visit her since she lived so close to the school. Heck even on the way there… I went to chowking to get hot lomi for her… although she didn’t eat it. I ate it just to look like that it was for me, stopping any embarrassment that would give away how much I liked her. In the end I couldn’t finish and had to throw away a lot of good lomi.        I wish she took it though… it was hot and steaming… perfect for a cold or slight fever. Anyway, I’m proud of pulling such a chivalric(more of a PA-cute) deed behind her back. I believe the best good deeds are to those actions no one witnesses.   Today we had soccer practice. We saw some chicks and told a friend (indirectly) that she was really a great friend and that she has a wonderful life ahead of her with one of my bestest buds and If some body wanted to change how DESTINY played things out… that body won’t be found in one piece when I get wind of it.     My shirt is wet with my watery drips… YUCK!!!    I hope I get better soon… for the sake of the people who have to be bothered by my altered habits.

      Fuck! I've gone through my third draft of that stupid HW logo. i'm stumped. I's still stumped on how I should make the opening sequence. Everytime I get frustrated I feel like opening a GURPS book and making a character... I want to remake some of the characters in the setting.   Warrant Officer Hess, who became General Hess(imagine michael clark duncan, with a cybernetic arm and a gleaming cybernetic eye, with his king-pin cigar)... but later became an outlaw as his secret came out of him being a genetrically engineered supersoldier leaked out. Being somewhat an abomination in the eyes of his superiors, they turned their backs on him and stripped him of everything he earned... for the glorious empire. (this is for the gothic horror sci-fi fantasy game or Reborn campaign).   He defended himself and survive the trap left by his fellow generals, being a supersoldier he was awsome in both command and in the heat of battle. When he tore down the power-armored soldiers that arrested him, they were amazed at his superhuman abilities that they all thought was mere-glory talk. His cybernetic arm-gleamed a golden color as tendrils of energy crackled and hissed as hi-energy bolts erupted from his secret weapon. Men-with the strength of machines halted when he bashed them down barehandded.   When he escaped, he most loyal friend and soldier aided him. Jax (i'm using Ty Diggs as a template)was a weapons master, bioengineered like Hess. Dispite his abilities and valor, he was never promoted and stayed a lowly scout... Hess had him trained in secret, and it all bore fruit when he most needed him.   Man I could imagine what i would need to create these cool characters.... YEAH A TON OF FREE TIME!!!

      AAAAAAAAARG!!! My friendster is not working well. I can’t access the posts I get and I can’t finish what I was supposed to do there. I feel like I have my priorities mixed. Oh well.   Mom has been talking to me. She asks how my work is and if I’m doing well. I am, I told her… I can’t help feel like I’m just what I am… an intern. I just hope the guys here give me the hours I need… That’s all I’m after. Too bad Russell turned down to give me the hours while I prepared his GURPS monsters and equipment for him. ALL that for the cost of writing I helped him out… which is a technical… good thing. It should count as OJT hours for school, creating the character portraits, maps and diagrams. I am making a presentation (a game!!!). I wish somebody just gave me that job… I’d have more time left over to do my thesis. I wouldn’t feel too frazzled to draw.   I so desperately want my projects over and done with… I’m planning to submit my HW late, that way I can see what everybody else did. Its all about working smart not working hard. That’s what makes a good student.   Although I want to show of my good ideas, I feel like I’m to advanced for the class. I play with psychological concepts when they all think MTV style. I want long term. ATTRACT the business end… that’s what makes a school worth going to. The more involved the school is with the industry the more prominent the skills of their students are and the more pressure there is to excel.   Thinking out of the box. That’s what RPGs teach you. Well Table top ones… I’m sorry for the consul players but hacking at monsters all day isn’t my view of a learning experience. I get more of a kick when I acquire a new skill than wasting my time killing monsters which I can do with my imagination…  Speaking of imagination look… I just flew, I gave a chick a like a great time on a date, I saved the world… wow, see powerful imagination is. And people pay a lot of money to have what other people just dream up. That’s advertising and that’s the job of all artists.   The trick is all about MORE BANG PER BUCK. Coming from a frugal mother, I learned that what makes your money worth while or anything else is how much you can milk from it. RPGs have been milked to the point of altering what it is or what it used to mean. What was once a catharsis is now a learning experience.   I loved the way bobby gave the spot light to JY who has a hard time articulating and rewarded him for the brave effort.   …. Oh shit back to work

      I had a nightmare… it woke me up at around 3. It was about twisted reality… it’s when your current situation is twisted. Mine was about being hunted down… it looked like it was right out of the 40’s with their black coats and hats. I dreamed that there was this bunch of government people (in the states where I’m going to live in) who is stopping people from moving around. Their hunt and prosecute people who wanted to make a better life for themselves, people who have left everything behind. I was one of the conspirators who devised a plan to have a mass migration undercover (there was about 200 people, enough to line a block in four columns). There is always a cunning badguy that can almost figure the plan out. So I made a diversion, leading him to focus on my migration… not everyone elses. He didn’t know that so many of us left, while he tried chasing me. Establishing the other migrants, gave me a place to hide when he though he had me, as I lived in a new house every day.   It was like out of schindler’s list as everything was in black and white. In the end, I survived, It took me the longest to loose the guy but he didn’t see what I was really trying to do.  Last nights game was so cool. I role-played my Johnny “Boom-Boom” Brisco fair-to my GM’s appraisal. It was my contribution to the party which made the mission so successful. It was nice to hear everyone praise it while I kept humble about it. It was a seesaw effect anyway, I fumbled in a roll with my DEMOLITIONS. So I had no reward no punishment. But it went so smooth.   We had to rescue 3 prisoners from a police detachment which was secretly being controlled by demonic forces. I suggested the use of knockout gas, since we have the element of surprise and it was the stealthiest “explosive” my character knewJ We finished the mission in 6 minutes (game time). It was in and out. Got 3character points for it, cleared my name, given free weapons and armor(carapace) by the Ordo Mallus (deserving after they put my char in a labor camp, and stripped us of rank and respect).   So brisco earns his keep… with better equipment. I bet bobby is gonna kill us in this last session. :) Well I have plans to recycle Brisco into my GURPS Gothic Horror Sci-Fi Fantasy War Campaign on December.    We’ll I have to be at work in 20 mins… bye for now.

      One of three… that’s me and my brothers. I call myself Balthazar because I’m one out of three. I can still remember how it all began, my first thoughts of my brothers… I was like dale (our sadistic and mentally imbalanced cousin). I tortured Gaspar when we were very young for the simple reason I was being tortured by my older sister. ( I don’t mean it as an excuse, but a conclusion)  I didn’t know how else to act as a child to my younger brother. I was always bullied by my older sister, I though bullying my chubby little brother Gaspar was what was expected of me. So I bullied him for the better part of his childhood. Then jobert came along, then we were three.   It was when Melchior came along that things changed… he was the smallest of all three of us brothers and as well as the smartest child I have ever know. I had no need to feel superior over my brother, so I took as much care of him as I saw my parents did.  When Melchior could learn to run, we both tortured Gaspar… We told our mother that we chased him around for him to lose weight. We would chase him from room to room, down the stairs and out the drive way. My mom got mad at me for my malice and told me never call Gaspar Fat. I stopped, it was that simple. I was the obedient son, and I stopped when she told me that. Then me and Melchior stopped chasing Gaspar around. We had not much toys… we were poor and everybody around me had toys. In ateneo gradeschool and preparatory school I watched my car pool mate play with his voltron toys, his voltes V and all the toys I drooled to have. All I had were my brothers…   Gaspar played with what toys we had. Melchior was already reading so I always bought him a book for 10pesos every week. Then the first computer came to our house. EGA graphics and midi sounds…. WOW!!! Of course the dungeons and dragons games there did not work… all we had was a box with a great art and a manual of what it was all about….  That’s when the story telling began. I was around 10, Gaspar 8 and Melchior 6. I read through the manual and immediately found a world I wish I could run around in. It was the images and the anime that I was exposed to early on which molded my imagination early. The lack of toys established a need, and my brothers… my only companions.   It was Iron Jack and Nimrod. Iron Jack was a bounty hunter and nimrod a thief magician. Rules never came up, nor did game balance. It was our toy, a toy that can be anything we wanted. Iron Jack had a sword called the Devil’s Toy… Nimrod had his magic and roguish abilities. We played and played, till we ended with them saving the world. Then we made the next generation, playing their children… then playing their children’s children…. It was all until 13 generations. I was in high school and around 16, gaspar 14, and Melchior 12. We had made a world so vast and great, I need my brothers to help me keep track of whose who and who is related to what. In fact, you will see these characters in all my fantasy stories.  Iron Jack, fleshed out to be Ivan Vladerick. Nimrod fleshed out to be Nimrodel Solfyre…. But I guess the lesson of this story is in the old saying when you have lemons…

      9th day on the job… I got home 11:30. I waited for henry to finish his class, while mine ended early. I went to Patrick when I got bored making characters for a GURPS Rifts game I shouldn’t be prioritizing. I wanted to make a GURPS character out of Michael Clark Dunkan (who is secretly a engineered super soldier), with a cybernetic arm, and a personality close to that of the King Pin Character he played in Dare Devil- still smoking cigars/  but has the codes and duties of his character in Planet of the Apes. I wanted to revive the old party as well, with Stampede being a humble mechanic/sheriff, Max Murdox our hacker and tank, Garret Jax played by Tye Diggs as a genetically engineered super assassin.   350 points.  50 character disadvantages 100 peripheral disadvantages  Sigh… I’d better get back to fixing my thesis.   On the way to school I listen to “On a High” by Duncan Sheik disco version. It being in a dance version made me listen to it again. It was a great reminder of what I am not missing out on: 	That problems will always be there, challenges as well as personal disasters and failures. Its that they shouldn’t get you down, and that you should put what really matters in the fore view.   	It was great falling in love… I mean getting a huge crush with this girl. I mean who else should I have had a crush on. Usually there is something bad about the person I find out making me disgusted to have ever liked them at all. But with this last girl, I’m really happy and immensely grateful that she was honest and not “bastos”-as henry put it. I just hope I meet someone like that again.   	Although I guess a lot of people may argue what love is to a stranger, I guess from a martial perspective things get pretty skewed. A soldier loves his country and will do everything to save it. His country may be the Philippines (I save on making examples of bad undertones about the country), but he learns to see the positive side of the cause and its potential to bear fruit of something good for everyone concerned. Still a countryman may stab him in the back one day… that doesn’t mean the whole country is at fault. Blame the individual not the organization.   	She was a near stranger. She gave nothing away, (to me that said everything I wanted to hear) and how she lived spoke who she was. Did I need to get to know her more? I guess I did, heck she did not know me. I’d talk and talk, and say nothing about myself. I loved it when she laughed at my little quips. I guess I looked for the character- the big picture and not the little parts. I  did not mind the little quirks and focused on the whole character.   	And MY GAWD was She a piece of work… (not physically I mean)  . I ‘m here writing and waiting for my boss to ask me to do something. I’ll be going to the office of my mom later to help out… another girl I liked(note the past tense)… it’s a whole EK-EK( the Filipino equivalent of mish-mash) of her working for my dad making it more of an off limits thing… and the fact she has a BF etc. etc.

       MY MORNING   	The BIATCH gave me a bad morning as she lost my work ID. I spent an hour looking for it… BITCH! She is such self absorbed little freak. I can’t stand her. I pay attention only with titanic amounts of prodding and when my mom is nearby.  	Another point on the side of not having kids. At least if they weren’t gamers… like me and my bros. I try to remember how I was at her age and me and my brothers didn’t bother anybody… In fact we just liked talking amongst ourselves cause we don’t know anybody who would enjoy what we talked about.    NO GAME 	  	Gaspar, Kezo and I were so disappointed yesterday cause there was no game. It really put us down. I mean… REALY DOWN. There were sounds of disappointments in the car on the way to kezo’s house cause it was that difficult to let go. I mean, it was really hard cause Kezo has so much to do and it was the only time Gaspar was there and we were planning to let him play a run of the mill 100pt cop. Just so that he can join us for that day.   	Our GM is a doctor at St. Lukes and there was an emergency which really couldn’t be helped.  	I was so pissed… frustrated at the circumstance that I had to find a way to cool off. So I took a long walk… to glorietta… to catch master and commander. I   MAKATI BY NIGHT (on a Thursday)   	It looked like a slightly less crowded Friday night. The movie was as good as I expected and I was only 5 mins late… since I left the house at around 7:13 to catch the 7:30 showing. I was jogging and I didn’t want to break too much of a sweat. So I took my time instead of going there full sprint. 	It was a good movie… and there gore really put me on the edge of my seat. The combat was thrilling as it was gritty and realistic. The story was told well although I heard it was 20 books summarized in one movie. I felt like reading those books but it would take a slow reader like me forever. Otherewise it’s a great movie… fortunately I’ll be able to watch ROTK on December when I go to the states…  	 WALKING   	I took my sweet time walking around glorietta and most of greenbelt. It was fun, I mean exploring it all like I didn’t know where I was going. The scenery was really nice and the fact that I had no money, was wearing jogging pants and a shirt, as well as being alone there gave me a lot of freedom to look around.   	There was something to smile about since I knew the place well. I’ve had almost all my dates here. I could remember most of the little stupid details of how I usually bungle up in them. It doesn’t matter anymore that they’re in the past and I’m 24. By 30 they would be just memories of the Phils and how much simpler life was as a student. Working and most probably struggling in the states, all three Magi would be complete and little else we would find ourselves needing.   	A lot of thoughts came to my mind in those walks and I completely forgot about how bad I felt missing the game.     RELATIONSHIPS   	I suck at them… I have no real wantings anymore… and the cool thing… I’m doing better than earlier this year… hell better. SO much has happened and so much learned.

       RPGS  Going to the game later…  	Bobbyn was naming his IG(imperial guards) after our characters and for me that’s an honor.    …AS an aside, Abhuman shock troop 1 of the 536th was led by a Veteran Sgt (bonehead) Dagu. Special Wpns Squad Bravo of the 537th had a demo expert called Brisco. What do you know, by turn 5, Brisco* hurled a demo charge at a charging rhino of the Space Wolves and trashed it. He also killed 4 marines in the proess. Someone get the man a medal…  -bobbyn   * Johnny Brisco is my character in bobby’s game. He’s Bruce Campbell, in light futuristic armor with great social skills and an experienced EOD (explosive ordinance disposal) and demolitions expert.   	As the knights of the dinner table would say: “whoody hoo!”   As for eat-all-I-can… I had a whole order of yang chow fried rice for myself and that was my eat all I can for today. I don’t even think I’ll need to take dinner. Thankfully the weeks seems to be pretty well spent…   I’ll be at henry’s by 4:30 and in the game by 7 or 6:30.    WORK and SCHOOL                    OJT: Its been sent to my boss and all I can do is remind him and wait. He just has to read through the exaggerations of time expenditure and then sign it all and be over with it. Oh yeah there is a new intern here at work. So I’m not gonna be the only regular intern. I was just told today… unfortunately I have nothing in common with the person and we are from differing fields. So too bad… no gamers sighted.  	  	THESIS: Well I’ve read through my proposal and found that I can still use some citing. I’ve added parts concerning Game Manufacturers Association or GAMA brochures which I won’t need to put much into detail since they are really meant to be reproduced and handed out.  	I’ll be downloading other stuff later concerning what each game would say a role-playing game is. As well as writing a GANT chart on how long it will be to finish the book.  	I’m also looking for a web designer who I can work with to make the website. I have no money and all I can pay for is a grand in pesos or $20 if anybody would want to help me make my website. 	Then there is miss Q. if shes not busy… I can ask her to help me make my website out of my parent’s company’s expense. Unfortunately that’s wrong… but I find myself thinking I didn’t hit on her anyway despite I was the son of the boss… why could’nt I ask her for some help… but I already know how my website is gonna look like… I just need help fixing the site up with art and all… anyway my parents are going to use their extra server space to support my website.

What I ate in today’s buffet:  	Spend 222.2 pesos 	A small sampling of ziti 	2 pieces of chicken  	2 bowls of cheese chowder with bacon and cheese bits  	2 baby pepperoni pizzas  	… I would have eaten… 	2-3 more pizzas if they came more regularly and early… 	we waited 30 minutes for a pizza that they messed up… 	Thomas had the good idea of talking to them and telling them that they should get the act together… I should have followed suit… DAMN. I actually ordered another pizza but since it took too long we just left like it never happened.  	I should have been more assertive… I called the waiter and he blatantly ignored us. We were the first to order pizzas and   	 TOMORROW                 HERC’S will feel my wrath as I scarf down 5 pizzas MWHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!               5 PIZZAS…

      Almost there…  	I just finally finished my OJT paper requirement. After which I will be free from it entirely and I would be free from some nagging in the back of mind.   WAKING UP  I’ve been waking up in the middle of the night lately. I have a short disturbing dream then I wake up and try to close my eyes and force myself to sleep. Ok that means something wrong with me. I know that those things only happen when there is something eating me in the back of my mind… I’d like to think its just my subconscious just wishing its just my subconscious wishing to get laid. I REALY WISH it was just that cause, it’s something shallow and nothing like treating myself to something to make it all go away.  BUT if it isn’t that then I will be finding myself more screwed up as the season goes into full swing.    THE BRAT 	 	Hmmmm…. What can  I say about my little cousin except that she is just a really spoiled brat. I guess its pretty mean of me to say so, BUT I can’t help it… she doesn’t have any sense of moderation and she thinks the whole world revolves around her.   	I wish they didn’t have to bring her over here.   Future Biatch:	“I’m bored!”  Me and My little sister: Ignore… Future Biatch:	“I’m bored!”  Me and My little sister: Ignore… Future Biatch:	“I’M BORED!”   Me: “When you say your bored its like telling us to stand up and entertain you…”   Future Biatch:	“That’s STUPID!”  Me and My little sister: Ignore… Future Biatch:	“HEY!!! I’m bored!”  Me and My little sister: Ignore…   	The Strategy is simply to make her find our company so boring that she will just keep quiet and not bother us. I know its mean, but a little less attention is a good cure for any spoiled brat. She thinks that with enough tantrums she can have her way… she’s dealing with the younger brother of a REAL FULL GROWN BITCH so there is a lot for her to learn little grasshopper.   	Oh well… hope she likes shopping cause I’m not entertaining her.   THESIS 	All that’s left to do for the week is fix my proposal. I usually need an outside opinion of someone with critical thinking involved. But the two people I would ask are busy… Thomas and Buster. Anyway, I think I can do it… if I finish it by tomorrow, I can draw for the rest of the Week.  	If I can finish the basic party portraits by that time I can make a poster in a day. I can then send it to the printer to make a poster of at a 2’x5’ (300 pesos cheapest).  	Diego Lao, Li Sin, John Harrison, Dahas, Don Alejandro De La Pena and Tadeo. That’s a whole lot of drawing, I really need some way to keep the flow of inspiration steady. I’ll also paint for the setting.   	Hmmm….  	RECORDS  	Ok I’m going to go to an eat-all-you-can tomorrow for lunch. I’ll work out in the morning as well as print out some papers so that I can take my sweet time. I don’t think I’ll be bringing a car and walk home from it instead.  			Record 	Enraku		5 orders of sushi, 1 yakisoba and 2 ramen orders (225 pesos), although I was disappointed by the last time I was there… I was HALF way when the orders started coming in increments of 10 mins … not to mention the traffic that we caught going there. Don’t eat there when its full or about to be full.   	Herc’s		3 pizzas (damn! I could have eaten more if I ordered 3 at a time, I had a game to go to and the sweet sauce was killing me, I’ll request for a regular sauce) (200 pesos) 	Don Henrico’s	I still have to see what system do they have (200 pesos) 	Buffet King	4 plates and 5/12ths of the pineapple cream thingy (200 pesos)  	Saisaki		around 15 pieces of sushi and 3lbs of tenderloin steak… or was it more? (350 pesos)  	National Sports Grill: None YET! (250 pesos but only the fries is unlimited… we’ll see he he he…)  	Nacho Fast	2 plates and almost 2lbs of cheese sticks… would have been more if we lounged around for another hour. (150 pesos) 	 	LIFE  	Its nice that I like eating and soccer (running mostly)  cause I can’t have one without the other. Health looks like its improving… despite that I had a game last Sunday.. and I forgot to eat for the whole day. Just trying to get through the obstacle of parents when you want to game really puts a lot out of you.  	DILEMA 	 Dad has his motor bike club and mom has her divisoria shoppings spree on Sundays… I have my soccer. Dad got pissed when I told him I have soccer and jasper will take over for me.  	Well if he stopped and thought… I don’t bug him to go play soccer with me… and I don’t want to play golf with him. We are two different people with different likes and dislikes. He should think about what he is getting mad at when I play soccer on Sunday… when they always complain about me working out if I don’t so… what it will be to YAK or not to YAK… 	 	 PARTING THOUGHT 	 	When jasper leaves… on dec. 15, I might have to stop soccer just to be the one to drive and do the errands.  	Why I stopped visiting my grandfather on my father’s side. The fact that he doesn’t care and even notice were there. He still has his wits about him unlike my other grandfather, he might as well act like he appreciates it… If I don’t feel like I’m wanted why stay… I’ve got better things to do… like staying healthy.   	I hope I can still play soccer… It may just be a sport… but god hasn’t given me anything else to cherish…  I don’t wish to lose this as well.     .

      ANOTHER WEIRD DREAM  	I had another dream today. It was those dreams chuck full of long time unresolved regrets and painful memories relived. Its again one those lonely places that I visit… this time it was an old village park. Complete with gazebos and an empty playground.  	There were people I know there. People who don’t hold me in any good favor. I wanted to avoid them but the park was so nice and cozy. I walked around, I caught the sight of rick who joined me.  When I meet up with Rick we usually reminisce about the old days. He was with me during my times in malate literary folio and he earned my loyalty by giving me a chance to explain my side when my ex destroyed my name to everyone we knew. And everyone was to eager to agree to what she said. Rick was telling me about what girls I should be meeting. He said I’d be better of with a Sagittarius and a Leo. I  laughed and pointed out those were my two last girlfriends.  We talked about the past a lot and how things were bad. We also talked about how things have changed. Rick is going of to be groomed to take over for his dad, while I’m looking for a job as an illustrator in the states.  Its like two old men talking… or how they were going to be talking like in the future. Nostalgic and Regretful, we both find ourselves walking bleak paths. I know his stands to love and living is similar to mine, and I usually hope that he gets luckier than me that way I see that there is some hope left. But rick is so picky with women, and I can’t blame him.  My ex threw herself on his lap and used to compare me to him saying I should be more like him and stuff. The funny thing is that the reason why she was so gaga about him, his sense of honor and uprightness is what made him not like her. It was enough for him to see for himself what was happening, and what she was doing to me. It was enough to make any man worry. Nice guys have fallible egos that’s why they can be corrected and changed, and when he understood what she was doing to me much more than me, he got more afraid of women being like that.  SOCCER  We played with a bunch of the Blue Guard and some of the younger guys who were with them. Thomas and I were there at three and the veterans invited us to play. They gave us a run for our money as the younger guys got us tired too easily while the veterans passed very well and had very good ball control. I hope to play with them again, It’s a real challenge keeping up with the younger guys and trying to predict the older guys.  I noticed the people who I anticipate to get the ball aren’t the ones passed to. I usually stay within sprinting distance that I could cover in the instant the ball goes that way. In the course of the game we changed field and had to take our shirts off to make it more visible who’s on who’s side. These guys taught me a lot and every lesson is counted and kept.  ATENEO  Well during the course of the game… something was there that blatantly reminds me of things gone by. Thomas told me how much ATENEO was a dating spot even on Sundays and what he said was easily proven true by the number of couples that were strolling past, lounging in the cars, making out at night and sitting on the benches that we have seen in the course of our soccer practice there.  One of the veterans caught me staring at a couple… where the guy was shirtless in the shade in his car… while the girl in her low tank top was wiping a wet towel on him… At around this time of the year the most attractive freshmen would be having clustered into couples. According to my friend, a freshman chick does not stay single for no more than to terms (in la Salle) and one term in none-trimester schools.      DREAMS today  I kept waking up as my dreams were so vivid last night. I dreamed of both LOTR and the soccer game. It was mostly replays of what I have seen in the course of the day. I woke up again in again, to as much as four times and probably more. I dreamed of the Thomas’ book the Weapons of LOTR which had everything about warfare and I mean everything. I tried stopping myself from drooling reading it.  The images came to haunt me in my sleep as they were competing with issues I keep leaving unresolved.   Fears… and a lot of work today.  MY GRANDPARENTS  I love my grandmother and grandfather of my mother’s side. I’ve mentioned it before that they were the ones who raised me through childhood when my parents were struggling with poverty. I missed them a lot, especially my grand mother. The first thing she asked me was: Translated from tagalog: “When am I ever going to have a taste of your first paycheck!?” 	She always kidded me about that. It was more than a year when I last saw her and she declares I’ve grown, but to my sad observation… she has shrunk. My lola’s hump wasn’t as pronounced at it is now when I grew up with her. So were the sun spots on her face. I’ve noticed her eyes were a lot dimmer, that I couldn’t see them past her glasses.  	My grandfather a strong man even at the age of turning 90. He’s hearing has nearly completely gone, from a rigid and strait back of a once pronounced and decorated principal of Notre dame university in cotobato he’s now stooped over as well. He doesn’t want getting help from people as he would walk. I remember him walking everyday, when I grew up, walking to national to buy my books for school when I was in gradeschool. He would go to mass with my lola everyday in Aquinas where everyone knew them.  	And during the time his prostate suffered a complication he’d rather stay at home than in a hospital. Where I was there to watch over him, and help him change bloody needles and bring him to the bathroom where it burned for him to urinate. I remember how it was for him to tell me about the war. Every time he mentioned someone he could remember how he lost them and it choked him to silence, but he wanted me to know how terrible it was so he continued telling the stories. 	When my overactive imagination takes over me and I could almost picture him running through the streets of manila at my age. When all hell broke loose as panic and struck. People were raiding the Chinese warehouses and he had to find shelter cause the Japanese were getting rid of all the men they could find. Running down the streets ancient streets of  manila past the slums and all the people that were suffering behind him he could not help. A dormitory of women gave him shelter, as so many of the men in the city left for war, fled or killed. They needed a man just incase the Japanese took advantage of them, some one would be brave enough to defend them. My lolo was a thin medium man of about 5’3”. He was studying in UST to become a doctor when hes undergraduate studies were interrupted by the war. He was a man of science, and came from a well to do family in ilo ilo. He was in modern regards a nerd, and a man who did not believe in fighting…  	Ok I got carried away there. If I have another chance I guess I would chronicle my grandfather’s life during the war. So that when his time comes, there will be something the next generation to remember.       WORK  1) Compile my OJT Requirements. Basically write a bunch of stuff for my boss to sign.  2) Go to ORYGINAL an MMA exhibit  3) Buy my lola a Pizza

       THOUGHTS   	I was about to go to sleep when the thoughts of crushes past came up to haunt me.  	I don’t know how much of the people out there think of those they wished that could have loved them before they close their eyes and let the sandman work his magic. I don’t know if it is a good thing or a bad thing to think of these things every night before I sleep.  	A comforting thought is the best thought to have in one’s mind before they would close their eyes on the world they may never wake up to.   	I know how much a pussy and a whiner I am. That’s why I write in this journal. I know well enough to leave somethings to myself and not bother people with it.  	Well getting back to the thought… I remember the only time someone accepted my flaws. It’s weird when you’re goofy, klutzy and absentminded all at the same time. You’re a cartoon character that doesn’t happen to be cute or in the least marketable.  	I remember it… and it was a comforting thought to have before I go to sleep. It’s a thought I don’t want to forget as well, hence me writing about it now.   I remember it …  and that’s all its going to be… just a memory.  Of course the nut kicker of the whole episode about remembering when that happened is that it was a dream.   Yep it was just a dream.   What I realize between being awake and being asleep is that (other than the obvious) reality has less limits. Yes I said it correctly… that it does have less limits. I limit myself and that what limits my dreams.   Despite how wonderful the dream I had was… it will always be a dream that will never be greater than a short experience unresolved or explored.  In reality… you can delve and find more things about it than you could possibly imagine.   She accepted me… teased me but accepted me even if I was clumsy and a bit stiff and rigid. Its funny how I walk… I’m all strait and upright, posture correct with no sense of confidence, just a guard to have on all the time. Afraid to trip and make myself look stupid again and again. I had enough in my early years of college.   I smiled… I mean. I found a way for me to smile for no apparent reason. Just like the way someone would just smile stupidly at something. The girl in my dream hugged me and I blushed and trembled… which was so unmanly. I tried to look calm and composed but that feeling of her hugging me is still there. A tingling in the back of my neck.   Slowly … it gives me the comfort that I’ve been looking for despite all the shit I’ve been through. It also comes at the time my mettle will be tested and I might not comeback from.  But since the girl I had in my dream was just an old crush… I guess some one out there is taking it easy on me.   CONVERSATION   I realize how much I follow the rule: “don’t do what you would want to be done to you…”. The reason I don’t give chase to the many crushes I’ve had is cause I’m a selfish enough bastard not to give myself a chance anyway. I know the standards of the girls I liked to well.   In high school my biggest crush (at 4th year) was the most gorgeous girl in the Christmas play. When you are simple you cannot heed the advice of “never letting your sights to high”. So a girl I went gaga for had all these great looking (and really nice) guys for the picking and I had nothing to offer on the table flat out.  Its things like this that make me remember why I don’t want a relationship.   The fact that there has to be something on the table from me or her. Its also the fact that back I have issues about good looking girls and I can’t talk to them. I can now but that’s on crumbling foundations.  I wasn’t made to be in a relationship. My last two made that clear. Although dreams like those seem to sustain me in a way. There is the matter that I don’t think I can contribute genetically. And even if I would… I would have to be with well… someone who can pass on something very lasting to the next generation.   I have to admit, that’s what attracted me to the last crush I had. She was so intelligent, cunning and she looked great. Not to mention I decided of giving it all another try and going for broke. Of course when you charge head on to a woman who didn’t know if you were alive or dead… and didn’t even as much care to notice was a big bad mistake.   I had to put on all the humor for one night with her… I swear I used up all my good ones just to make her laugh. After being spent… I guess there really wasn’t anything I can do to keep her… in short of groveling. And I knew and she knew despite it was something tempting it was an option that shouldn’t be explored.   … sigh…   DREAMS   	I dreamed melchior ended up with Fiona. I was so happy. There was a wedding and all and me and gaspar were involved with helping them get hitched. Nephews… a lot of nephews. I would just be really happy once one of us get hitched… I just hope its someone who can stand close uncles.  	Although the dream really showed me how committed I am in not screwing someone else’s life. Its also the fact that melchior is the most optimistic of all three of us and would have the best chances of getting a girl and a happy family.  	And melchior wouldn’t worry about his height cause… its not genetic. He was supposed to be heck taller than me but it was something to do with his child hood lack of nourishment. Me and gaspar are the same height… Melchior would at least be ours and if things went that way… we would look too much alike.  	The only thing that would separate us is the age difference which becomes unnoticeable as we grow older. Heck people mistake that gaspar is older than me.   Parting thought: at 24 i think that the next 50 years can be happy without some one other than close friends to share it with. At 24 ive met alot of girls and wooed some of them to no avail while learning that the person who can tolerate me is a dream... My dream girl. I understand now that there realy isnt anyone for me. By May i'll be in the states... F. was like the last girl i felt realy strongly for. She was almost perfect and almost accepted me... (well in my fantastic imagination) i've gotten used to seeing women not anymore as the other half of a whole men ache for and see them as... but a symbol of something i should learn to live without.   Buster said that I have a dented knight in buffed up old armor sydrome... Was i born in the wrong age?  ...and the weak is weeded out for the stock... humanity is stronger for the sacrifice...

       WORK   I’ve been working the whole day… well mostly. I must have spent 5 hours on one assignment cause I was crazy enough not to make it easy to pull off. It was a good and powerful concept but I really lacked the skill to pull it off. So I got stuck with pouring so much time on it.  I’m doing the work in the company’s 500mb ram computer… which makes my computer look like a Pentium I…    GAMES   I have to establish a standard of power. Its just weird that Cows and bulls are so strong compared to giants and ogres I end up wanting to be a genetically altered humanoid cow. I guess I’ll just fix the stats that the cow’s working ST is different and they actually have the same strength as a four men.   Giants have a strength of 30… An ox has a strength of 80…  Hmmmm… I’ll play ox giant hunter…   If I make it that an ox would have a ST of 18… like Arnold but their quadruped body just lets them carry more… then that would be logical.   I won’t go dragon ball levels in power or matrix for that matter. Ogres are twice as strong as a human (ST20) and dwarves are pretty much stronger (ST13), while genetically engineered humans are a good midway (ST15)  New Advantage  Improved Extra Encumbrance 10cp/level 		1st level	                2nd level			4th None 		x2		x3  (increments of 1)	x5 Light 		x5		x10 (+ increments of 5)	x20 Medium 	                x10		x15 (x2 of light)		x40 Heavy 		x20		x30 (x4 of light)		x80 Extra Heavy 	x30		x40 (x5 of light)		x100  This advantages presupposes that some creatures are better built to carry loads instead of them being actually stronger. So an OX can have level 4 (40cp) of extra heavy encumbrance to be equal the strength of 80 in carrying loads but would do as much damage as 16 (a power lifter). This will also better reflect giant creatures as they humanoid form would proportionally be better suited to carry their own weight.    THOUGTHS  Hmmm…. Work pre-occupies me these days. Fear of not finishing my thesis on time as well. I was planning to finish the appendix today… but this homework took so much time cause I had to relearn my 3D max in the span of making the project.   The particles effect took the longest cause rendering it was a little hell on its own.   I’m saving money for enraku. I hope Thomas and Anton can join me. Then the week after that would be eat all we can pizza again. I just have to save up for two things… Enraku and Tita Su.   God I’m hungry…   I’m budgeting my week… 300 for eat all you can and tita su, 100 for gas… that leave 100 for lunch… damn… I need 150 more.  Oh well I hope I can bum gas. I guess I have to stop drinking buko juice: that’s 15 pesos off my expenses. How about another 50 bucks?  … one cup of rice a meal???  Damn!  Oh well…

       NEWS   I’m leaving for the states by December 15 at the latest. My mom just popped it on us and all plans that I laid out for Christmas dried up and crumbled like some bad movie special effect. 	It sucks that I can’t run that GURPS power game I have planned. After working so hard in mastering GURPS and adding it to the list of systems I’ve managed to min-max under my belt.  	 	I pat my own back telling myself its ok… given what ever screwed up thing happened to me or in the most recent case I happen to screw up…   	So there goes the 3 magi… disappearing from their homeland. Its really no place for artists or craftsmen. You can’t make enough time in this country without causing one aspect to suffer.   	On a positive note, I’ll be meeting Thomas in New Jersey. We could probably play some soccer while we’re there. I don’t think I’ll be touching much of my gaming stuff after all the shit I’ve gone through this term.   SOCCER   	The practice went well. The sun was blazing hot and it was about 30 something degrees when we played. It took out so much from us but the pressure from the heat at least taught us to maximize effectiveness while minimizing effort.   	The heat was so terrible that we resorted to tactics so that we wouldn’t tire so much. We developed plays and we were beginning to get a hang of them.   	At around five… some freshmen asked us to join them. At that point we were so spent… we hardly ran during the game. But it was an amazing improvement as we began to score goals through sheer tactics.  	 	The plays were beautiful as the timing was so carefully planned. We didn’t run much, and the freshmen were really fresh and sprinted back and forth across the short field.  I guess to us it was a victory cause… you really can’t call it a success when your racing  against a cripple… and we were practically crippled with exhaustion. But the fact that we scored with out running… was no less impressive than a crippled man being able to finish a race.    PERSONAL  	 	… You can’t apologize to someone you don’t know. Despite how contrite you may be… apologies require a connection that isn’t so easily severed.   	I learned something last night… a simple lesson. But a lesson nonetheless. I tried to see if I could still help out people who have the potential to kick so much ass but I ended up making someone feel like I was patronizing or getting something off my ego.  	I was wondering if the person ever read my journal?   	I didn’t think so…  	As a personal note… people who try to help other people… may just be helping in the hope that karma might come around and help them.   The lesson about people who really don’t want/need help I guess applies in this circumstance I guess.    GAMES  	I made several breakthroughs in cheesing… 	 	I have found a way to maximize Protection through knowing when DRs should be high… and armor reinforcement would be most effective.   	I budget the creatures according to the following  	Mook fest: give or take 25cp 	Mooks 75cp (standard soldiers) 	Effective mooks 100cp (Strom troopers) 	Elite mooks 150cp (Elite storm troopers or Special forces) 	Named mooks 200cp   	Antagonists: give or take 50cp 	Average Badguy 300cp (Elite Dark jedi) 	Elite Badguy 500cp (Elite Sorcerer Swordsmen) 	Named Badguys 700-800cp (Cyber-Arch-magi)  	Inhumans: give or take 100cp 	 Mook 100cp 	(Elite LOTR Orcs) 	 Effective mook 300cp (White Wolf menagerie) 	 Elite mooks 500cp (DnD Outsiders) 	 Named Badguys 1000cp (bad... very bad)

      Trying Not To Be A Nerd  	I have been lazing about with my work lately. I realize that I must spend… at least 5 hours of my waking 15 hours in recreation. It is either games or thinking about games… calculating game numbers and facts or analyzing mental graphs determining when “diminishing returns” occur and maximum value… and of course making up stories of imaginary people doing things I wish I was doing.  	1 hour is mostly spend moving around. From walking back and forth the office taking orders like the gopher I am to walking home from work. 	When it is those days I drive… the time I spend moving around goes to up to 3 hours total. That’s why I love walking to work.  	Work… real work is about 3 to 4 hours. Concepts are hard to make… given that creativity is such in low supply these days in this country. I spend half the time making concepts… sketching images with a vague resemblance to its future outcome… and thinking of reasons why it should work and how it would best affect the target audience.  	Of course there is my school work…  	Let me get this off my chest…   	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!  	(sigh) O.K.  	Then there is my school work… which is a BOOK!!! Then homework for two subjects.    	Concepts takes me forever… and when It comes to a book… I don’t jump in to making something with out really thinking of actual relevance.   	I’m not like a guy when the first chance of loosing his virginity comes along…  	Drawing something always takes a while for me… I love doing intricate detail… and I’m sure the people who like my art does as well… But in a 200 page book with about 150+ drawings needed. I want the drawings to make a name for my self with my art as well as my Thinking.   	So I spend my few remaining hours trying to fix my story and visual theme for the book.   	I’m kinda thin and the cold does havoc to my thin fingers and manual dexterity.   	Ack…  IN OTHER NEWS  	I want to go out but I have to prioritize on my studies and work these days. I and Thomas were talking about “eat all you can” and we were planning to eat at Hercs Ortigas City Center the first chance we get.  	200 pesos, seven inch pizzas and bottomless drinks.   	Enraku just beside hercs: 225 pesos… eat all you can sushi, sashimi and ramen… no drinks (water is bottomless).  	Don’t order the ramen if you want to maximize your 225 bucks.  	Its just all soup and noodles.  	I invited Antonio to eat out at in Don henrico’s in Jupiter Street.. Cause of the 200 peso eat all you can pizza and pasta… but the person he was meeting didn’t want to.    	THURSDAY GAME 	We all kicked Ass  	Merric played by Nell was our resident sharp shooter with a hans solo angle, Henry was our Tank with Dagu and I was the “tool”-verine Garret Logan Private Detective…   	But I cannot take pride taking down people who couldn’t penetrate our armor… but the second encounter was truly a challenge when there was some real lethality to it.  	My pride in how I designed my character came when the smoke grenades obscured the vision of everyone … except for me with my thermal imaging. It was just cool how coming into a game prepared for the worst makes a character stand out heroically.  	Oh yeah not to mention that there was knock out gas mixed in the smoke which was filtered by my bionic respiration system.    On another Note...  the remake by mandy moore of that song... i find realy depressing. Maybe cause its about rejection... and i've always been in the more painfull end.

      Today’s weird dream.  	It was somewhat a foretelling of events. My dad was there and several corrupt cops were there. I was in the lower down trodden sector of a city that resembled manila. Crowded, Dirty and Dark, there was a gray haze that gave me a very depressed impression.   	I was trying to go undercover and infiltrate this private army. It was scary in a sense cause I had to almost do what they did. It was easy to talk big… anybody can do it, and preaching to the choir was a small specialty of mine. I was getting with in the organization till they started asking me to get a gun. They were asking for some hard identification and some money. Money wasn’t a problem… the guns were surprisingly cheap… but fake ids that would stand was.  	 	I didn’t want them to find out who my family was through who I really was. I don’t plan on living long but I plan on ending it all with a bang.   	Then the setting of the dream struck me silly as it began to rain and I noticed how corrupt and polluted with moral feces the world was. It was depressing and I thought that I might as well join all that tried before me in death.  MY BOOK (I and my partner’s book) 	 	I got to study history in detail with the research of my book. When you become a hero… you suffer and so does your family. A real hero suffers because his actions ripple an affect all their loved ones. When your family suffers cause of you it makes the suffering much greater.  	I have a character in the story named Tadeo… Thadeus…or the Saint of Hopeless circumstance. In the story that is part of the book… his uncle is outwardly a manupilative old man who uses him as a go between. Unfortunately his uncle usually gets him in situations that would kill him or any layman… there is one thing that makes Tadeo survive… 	Not love… Not duty or Obedience… But Guilt  	Tadeo was married when he was 14, to a beautiful young orphan his uncle got to buy his complete and unconditional loyalty… Unfortunately, that’s not how you have a relationship… it twists it turns and I leave enough to keep the book interesting… he now does dangerous errands for his uncle…  	How does he survive… well, there must be a reason to survive for a character given the turbulence of the age where people backstabbed people left and right… The fall of the Philippines came from the hands of traitors more than any other foreign force.   	Ha ha read the book :)  	THE MATRIX  	Well… it ended… it wasn’t that great but it ended. BTW I’m writing this cause I choose to write it… and I know the full degree of what my actions will cause.   Superman fight was cool… but under the context that they are programs and programmers able to manipulate the code then why wasn’t the most dramatic part of the fight done with more physical power.  I can’t fairly judge it cause its undertones is pretty new age and I’m an LOTR guy. LOTR is not new age to me… its about war and human trials… Matrix is something that I can’t get cause the movie looses its message when its being to cryptic.  Its not an overestimation of the audiece’s IQ. Its just targeting the wrong market and expecting the wrong things from that market.

      Dreaming of Nothing…  	We had soccer and it was fun. Well it was fun going against each other. It seems I gained a level in soccer (gawd that’s geeky). The guys told me I got better and that was a big ego jump… I usually don’t need complements… I feel like my head is getting to big for my own body already. I guess it was coming, and we were all getting better anyway… 	For my part, I guess the reason I… We improved is how much of a bunch of nice guys we are…   	First of all… we played in ateneo even when those old fogies wouldn’t want to play with us and they kicked us out of one of the field. With men its always a pissing contents… the guys just shrugged and legt… (I can go on with this but I’d save it for some other thought) 	Second… well we’ll play with anyone who wants to join us. Of course there was this three year old boy about a foot and a half tall, in mini soccer shoes and jerseys that was just so cute… He had a Totti Jersey… and when he came up I played goaly diving for a ball that only moved four inches when he kicked it… The kid had such an expression of wonder that he followed me to our game. The guys found the little tyke cute as he ran around us trying to join our game… We were all giants and this little kid wanted to join… (makes me want to change my mind about having kids) 	Third… we’re gentlemen… even in the in the medieval game of soccer. I know a lot of sour pussies who can’t play the game without intentionally hurting other people and cheating.  … I won’t go there… but it’s a hoot to hear me insult someone….  Things TO Do…   That I don’t feel like doing  	Formatting Proposal and Arranging The Appendix 	OJT documentation 	Game outline 	Drawing 20 more pictures for the book  Things I’d like to do  	Making the Character Templates for this Christmas game 	Playing Temple of Elemental Evil Computer Game 	Playing All the games Gaspar bought for me  Things I don’t mind doing	 	The new logo egan is asking for.

      SOMETHING I CANNOT GET…  I don’t know what to say when something good happens and something bad happens right after…  	I’m caught in a predicament… I can’t be really happy when all of a sudden something bad slams into my face and I feel like shutting up… the way a good boy is taught to do.  	“Bad doggie… now don’t go barking up the wrong tree” (newspaper swak!)  GOOD NEWS  	Monday… I’ll be off work early and have a chance to watch the Matrix with company…  	I’m gonna play soccer today!!! Me and the Guys will be in ATENEO soccer field and implore any soccer people to join us. We’ll be playing from 2:30-5:30.  BAD NEWS  Someone connected me to a past that I would rather forget… I feel like running to my friends to tell (WHAAAAGH!!!) BUT I’m not that much of a baby (anymore at least).   JUST NEWS  	I’m almost done with my other school requirements… its just that I have to submit them in Tuesday…

      	PHILOSPHY (advised to skip its just mental jabber)	  What’s worth saying…  	I was talking to buster the other day. I watched the movie “city of god” and there was a part about the main character and the chick he liked. (OT- I have to admit Rio de Janeiro is a really awesome place) I’ve wondered about a lot of things again… and the part that finds itself in my attention is the role of the savior and the victim or the knight in shining armor and the damsel in distress. 	 	I know a couple whose screwed up but I can’t help cause that’s how screwed up they are. I know this guy who preys on younger doe eyed girls with smooth talk and praises: I washed my hands of it. I know this girl that is being used as a… play doll by this guy who keeps making her hope that they’ll be in  relationship. I know of this…  	… it realy doesn’t help if I drag in this matter…   	Its just that people can’t be rescued. They have to save themselves and some one just helps them along. It would suck to see someone as a savior instead of a friend or a companion. It also sucks to grow dependent on someone for support where it would be better to draw the inner resolve from one’s self.  	In short… there are no saviors… just victims and more victims. People who fall prey to one weakness and the other…  	To the most important point that women won’t get about guys…  	Me: “What do I do if the girl you dig gets into trouble?” 	Buster: “Be her knight in shining armor” with no expression in his voice. 	Me: “But I’m bitter, angry and hurt” 	Buster: “Be her knight in shining armor saying ‘I told you so’” again with no expression in his voice.  	It boils down to that…   	(Sigh)  	MY LATEST DREAM  	I dreamed John Christopher was alive. I dreamed that my little brother was alive. He lived only 26 days from his premature birth and I dreamed he was alive. His living would have changed me incredibly and completely. 	He would have been the fourth brother… and we would have totally ignored my little sister. We would have been four inseparable brothers. Melchior and Gaspar would have someone to play older brother to and would have changed their perspective of my role and why I play the kuya the way I did.  	He would be 10 years younger than me… he would have been 14 and he would be filled with the hope all three brothers had but lost through experience. I was so happy in the dream.  I was so happy in going home when it was not only my little sister to see but another guy in the house to talk about guy stuff about. Another guy who I can teach how not to be “torpe”, how to be helpful, how to be able to talk to girls and not be paralyzed with shyness, and a little brother who can learn to GM and Game like his kuyas before him.   It was such a strange dream cause, I was just living a normal life. Work then home, games on certain days, friends and family. With another younger brother, I was going through it all happier. With a little grin on my face that won’t wash off with how bad things have been getting.   Of course thats just a dream... i happy it was just a dream...  REALIZATION  If I ever get of my lazy but and do anything with my life… what would be the point? I can’t have children for so many cluttered and petty personal reasons. When I move to the states, maybe I’ll settle down and have am-girls and boys. NO fucking way… In haven’t heard of an Am-girl boy or girl who’d show more respect for their parents than me (and I’m not that goody).  They might be better off as meztizos, than Filipino pure breeds but what would be the point if they grew up spoiled.  …(this rant to buster) Buster: “ you can’t guarantee a normal childhood, but you can make sure to have a loving one.”  Ok… that shut my trap  GAMING  Characters I want play:  Genre: Thriller/Horror Sci-fi Fantasy war campaign Commissar Hess  Appearance: Michael Clark Duncan Concept: A strong (physically and mentally) and imposing military tactics leader. Dutiful and Dangerous, he skirts the edge of morality and ethics as he lives in era of constant war where he commands cut-throats and ex-cons.  He was once a decorated hero who sucked into the intrigue and skullduggery of military politics. 	 Idea: I was inspired by “causalities of war” with Michael j. fox. But wanted to play a military leader like his(MJF) captain who was going crazy… but in a subtle way as he begins to pray for his death and keeps charging recklessly into the fray, hoping that he'd die a violent and glorious death not that of a farmer- cold, starving and helpless.  Story Elements: a traitorous best friend, a son (he was elevated in rank to be a source of genetic material… siring a son as a new breed of super soldier) who worships his legend but gets disillusioned by him by Hess' moral decisions. An his men is trying to frame him.   Genre: Thriller/Horror Sci-fi Fantasy war campaign Garret  Concept: NYPD blue’s detective zippowitz (the small veteran detective) meets wolverine. With the horrors of MJF in casualties of war. He is a morally upright character who keeps his kind streak a secret. Cybernetically mutilated he deals with his new found pains from the surgery giving him a compulsions to improve on them. 	 Story Elements: lots of action, a lot of people trying to pull him down, a lot of violence. New friends and a very meaningful death.

      Single me… out…  ANOTHER DREAM  Well I had another dream again.   This was freaky as it was again about water.   Someone needed to be rescuing and I didn’t jump in or anything at all. She was as good as dead and I just stood there and watched this creature devour her. When I did move it was just to see if she was still alive and I watched her guts spill out of her open wounds.   It was weird cause underneath her skin, the muscle disintegrated. I just watched someone get killed and I the so called hero… didn’t care.  No fire, no passion, and no remorse.  Then  I find myself in intramuros walking the very dark and forgotten cobbled streets of the ancient city. Unfortunately its not the modern times, I remember the date and it happened to be the time of the cholera epidemic during the late 1800’s. People were dropping like flies as I walked and made my way through the gaslit avenues.   Men were talking to me in desperation. Something important but I didn’t care… so I kept walking on.  Then I woke up… turned the fan on and went to the kitchen for water. It was still dark, and my eyes were too dry to open. I went back to bed after taking one swig of the glass.   BEING YOUNG  Johnny texted me and asked me if I was afraid of death.  I said sometimes. I told him that sometimes we fear it and sometimes we don’t even care. When I’m at my happiest I wish I ‘d die. When I was still a devout catholic, I did all my requirements and accumulated my graces. I followed it all to the letter of strict Opus Dei regulations of what a good catholic is.   It was difficult… strict control of thoughts as well as avoiding occasions of sin.  I didn’t enjoy it… in fact I hated it. But I was always told that heaven would be the reward for those who lived by it’s rules.   What’s the point of heaven when you can never appreciate life.   Be a good catholic and do all this so that you can die happy.  I was a teenager who wanted to die before even my life began. One can easily see the flaw in the teaching and what was so wrong with all of it.    A religion that tells us to die before we even had a chance to live is a CULT not a religion.   Anyway… I didn’t tell Johnny all that. I just told him that fearing death is one of the things that isn’t that important to dwell on.   But then again hes 14 and hell be pondering about it philosophically and feel like an expert like all teenagers.   I was once arrogant, foolish, stupid, and young. At 24 I couldn’t do the things I used to do when I was 20. In fact I get cramps now… I never got cramps till now. I never knew how it was to push beyond my bodies limits. When you get older, you find those limits and the nail you down.  Well me for my case.   I had my mind now with my age and opportunity then… the happiness of breezing through life and taking the opportunities I missed because of raw stupidly and ignorance (because of being a religious freak) the adventures I could have had and the evils I would have avoided.   But then I get shot down back to earth…  Reality feels like a toxin seeping into my pores, hiding in the air I breathe, and hovering over me like a warden, ready to pump me with rubber bullets.   ANOTHER TIME  I used to draw little comics about a character who was me and his family. It came of as a children’s book where it’s a single father and his two children. A comic of how Jade the six year old little girl would take care of her little brother Jeremy.  How they played in the garden, or how she taught him to speak, or how the played in the house. Their father would always make breakfast and dinner, as well as fix the house. They would be dropped off their grandparents who lived nearby while their dad went to work, and always came to fetch them after wards.  Although the drawings were depressing to look at. Cause I always drew Jade and Jeremy in an empty house waiting for their dad to come home late from work.   I guess that’s what some men really want… a reason. A reason to go home or to go on…

      I had a dream again…  This dream was pretty depressing in how I saw it…  Have you ever seen manila bay during a storm… maybe an early afternoon storm, with strong winds coming from that polluted bay.   I could smell it and I was holding my breath.   Although there was no land… there was no manila. There were islands of junk, and some of the garbage swept against the huge boat my family was staying in.   The boats or the barge was huge, its like a huge pyramid floating on the ocean and I watched how the garbage would hit against its sides. In the horizon where there rest of the Philippines should be are islands of garbage, still burning despite the heavy rain.   I asked mom when we were moving back into the states. Shes quiet, shes quiet when the answer would be unpleasant.   I just watched the waves buffet against the ship. I could see some people who make their living scavenging and scrounging. It was scary, I didn’t want to touch the water. It was dark and I felt that there was something there.   The ship was so huge, the proportions just hit me when I had to drive around it’s interior. I was in the car with Thomas and Kat.  We got to talking about how nice guys finish last. They had some female friends who tagged along and they talked about how wealthy/successful/or handsome the guys they dated were. Being a realist, I kept quiet as they jabbered on. I over heard them relating how she gave a guy a bj…   I was surprised when one of my old crushes T. was there. We passed by her and they repeated the conversation. She felt kinda depressed, and I kept quiet just watching the road and looking around, while I think it was Thomas driving.   Its then I felt two arms come around me… They gently hugged me from behind, folding around neck high but resting on my shoulders.  … I was… was… I couldn’t… think… I was soooo relaxed and shocked…. I was…  its like… “god you can kill me now, I’m ready”.   I could feel my heart race, adrenaline was being pumped but I didn’t move an inch. I was so stunned I didn’t notice they all were quiet.  It just dawn on me… “WAIT A MIN, DON’T YOU HAVE A BF!!!” and it just hit me, she did and they were supposed to inseparable types. She said that was all past and gone…  I broke away… regrettably. We all got down to walk.   She was talking with the other girls, while Thomas and Kat were walking together ahead. T. calls me but I wanted to ignore her. I didn’t want trouble, then she would grab my arm, and drag me with the girls as I always walked behind everybody.   Ouch ouch couch… its like holding something burning that gave your heart an emotional orgasm. I was rigid and didn’t look at her, infact I tried to look away. She would just giggle and drag me as she teased with the other girls about how red I was.   “poo”  I could not bring a witty retort, no funny remarks, no “ha ha”. My muscles just tensed and I found myself wishing she never let go…   I remember the place looking like Rockwell with the palm trees and earthen colors.   We watched a movie… although it was awkward being “company for a day, for a person who would never really careed and I was wished so badly she like me back”  I was quiet… dead quiet.   In the movie, it was then I noticed that she was tipsy.   “damn” no wonder she felt like playing along. Her loose hold on her wit made her say all these things to flatter me… and I tried not to listen. It was easy cause I just stared back at her in the dim lights of the theater. She giggled most of the time at what she said. Ouch.  When we all said good bye, she hugged me by surprised as I left with Thomas and Kat. And I could feel my knees buckle and loose all control over them.   I could feel all the color in my face go and when I turned to look at her… all I could hear was her giggles and my eyes opened to the dim lights of five in the morning.  I wish I didn’t ever wake up from that dream… god could have killed me with some freak accident and I would just have a smile on my face.   And it was T.   The first time I saw her and gawked. Glen told me I had no chance. He was right. When she was my classmate, I found out she had a bf already and I put my hopes up by asking her to add me to her list of friends in friendster.   Some one shoot me… at least shoot me when I’m having that dream again.    talk about gutting the lonely pig... tats what it feels right here

      I’m listening to Sarah Mclachlan and it feels like when I first listened to Beverly Craven when I was at first year highschool. I used to listen to her while the sun set in southridge. The sky was glazed with orange and deep red that spilled to dark the easter horizon. Alabang didn’t have so many high rise buildings and it’s horizon was beautiful and unlimited... just like here in the states. I just look and find myself looking at a 360 degree horizon. the buildings are so low and gives way for your vision to see all that is around you.   Mel got me the CD and I am REALLY Grateful!!!  The world is fading for me. As things begin their stark change to something else I find myself seeing another story unfold before me.   Damn it woman... If I could only find you...   My dreams strangle me... it’s a strange sensation... I feel like reality is shifting and I will be turning into something I did not expect. The blast of hot water is help to shake me from my perpetual irritation and annoyance. I feel like I’m someone else. Dreams are firghtening me because of the content i see myself doing. I see myself desperate and unclean. Then the dreams that calm me after calling out to her.    I sleep and dream of losing myself in the forests of New Jersey, with my hunting knife and my survival skills. I keep dreaming of coming out of the Ice cold water reborn in some way. Older, more scarred, with eyes that have a bitter freezing light indescribable conflict.   I see my grayed hairs that try to grow on my shaved head. My flat featured face, white from the cold  and full of healed scars. Water dripping from my face and thinned lips. I’m an old man, happy yet still alone and searching.   Looking into myself I see a lot of growing up still for me to go through while a part of me, the boy adventurer is still young. Every time I see an American public highschool I secretly wish I had a chance to have a chance to grow up around “normal” social conditions.  Hearing Sarah’s voice, a sustaining image of what she could sound like sets in my mind. Seeing past crushes and women I admired but never saw me carves an image in my head. A voice and a face... she is with me in my dreams. I feel like settling done with my fantasy. I’m more optimistic, maybe I’ll meet her. Even if I never will, this fantasy is so real I may never see past it. I may never wake up to see it... for all I know I’m already dead and this is a dream... I can feel her before I go to sleep.   She is not waiting for me... she is living. That life she exudes is what I feel. She may be happy with someone else... she may be somewhere I missed. She may be loving someone so much I can find comfort in her happiness and security.   Sara... damn... I should draw you for my book as my heroine.   I used to draw Chez as a character in my story... she plays the love interest who doesn’t love my character at all. Why play a woman that way in my own fantasy, its because the fantasy is doing what he does for her. In the story Tadeo... is hopelessly trying to make up to all the sins he committed to her(not that I have any to chez... its just that I feel incredibly guilty around women.. Figure?!). His uncle Nicolas acts as his priest handing out his penance. Sending him to places where he watches his uncles enemies indulge in and rape the land he was born. An irony. He watches the abuse fall on strangers he has no connection to. Driving a sense of guilt so heavy and terrible that it drives him crazy. Tadeo is suicidal and has scars to show all the crazy risks he has put himself in just to run away from having to answer for his actions. He slowly becomes blindly righteous annoying the hell out off everyone close to him. Erratic and spiraling out of control... he should be dead but he pulled off things no one could ever believe. Feats of combat ability that is the stuff of legends (by real world standards).    “ Why don’t you kill me and end my misery... or you can just die and add to my guilt. Either way I have the better deal”  -Tadeo  Tadeo is about what I believe in love that enough of it gets around that even if you think your not loved... you are. He kept thinking he deserved the pain and guilt his uncle was giving him, only until his uncle dies does he reaching the breaking point where he completely remembers all the people he cares about that he has turned aside to go on his needless penance.   I should have Sarah in my art. Good thing there is a good picture of her in the album.   Its only when I get into ten minutes under the hot shower set at the temperature I used to have my hot chocolate. Its when the blood rushes to your head and the pain of waking up without someone romantically attached to or in mind you struggle to leave that dream and address the reality you have to deal with first before you can go back to sleep the night to come.   It’s a new year before I right another one. I’ve been righting this blog for about 3 months now. AMAZINGLY with consistence, never going less than 3x a week to as much as everyday.   New year resolutions...  I’ll continue to be the nice guy... even if I never meet her. I will never pass up being a father and trying my hand out with a family.   Hopefully I can meet someone who is interested for a short run of 20 years if I never meet her so that I can raise my boy.  I guess the resolution is that I do what I do and try to be a nicer guy. Now that I will be working and more irritable... that I guess is a good choice of resolutions.

      Ok… now I have dreams….  It is about living here and the life I could lead far away from where I was born. The dream was strange and filled with an undercurrent of emotions which could not be seen except for in parts of the dream where I was alone. I could see faces and remember how it was to feel and drink my fill of living. There were several faces, I guess I was groping for someone. I took what I could get, it wasn’t that great of a happiness but it was like warmth in a storm, a small piece of something that can sustain.   I guess I was happy, the experiences were more tragic then any other experience I have felt before. With my luck, I’m sure when things begin to turn my way, bad luck will strike sooner than expected. When something can go wrong, it will go wrong. It’s not that I’ a pessimist or anything like that, its just that I’ve noticed My luck swings in extremes. I can be very luck and very unlucky, so when the other head rears itself I brace for the other one which follows quite soon.   BACK HOME  Well other than Chat, I don’t hear a lot from what’s happening back home. Buster has no internet other than from school. Ton is still in Bangkok, Thomas has been busy, and Everybody else I know don’t keep blogs for me too check on.    PASALUBONG  I bought a lot of pasalubong, for those who aren’t Filipino they gifts on returning from trips. It simply means “brought back.”  I got a lot of miniatures for everyone, cause its cheaper here and the Reaper brand isn’t sold here. I was planning to start my own miniatures company when I have the capital, since the labor here is so much cheaper and its easier to find artist who can understand western concepts such as fantasy figs I can outsource people to sculpt the figures and color them like Dwarven Forge.  Given the cost of labor being the part that makes the figures so expensive, I can cut the cost of the figs to about half.   Dwarven Forge costs $16 for 3 pieces of colored metal figures, DnD miniatures go for $10 for 8 rubber figurines with poor quality. With the outsourcing I can do, and the people I know, I think I can make it cost $2 per plastic miniature at the same quality as Dwarven forge.  That’s on one on one retail, for whole sale the cost will be heck cheaper. For the cost of starting a warhammer set of $75, for a number of figs that equal the cost of $150. I can make mine $50 dollars with the same number of figs BUT COLORED.   That would basically crash the market… Cause if I were to make the figs compatible with the Standard sizes for figs and interchangeable bases then I’ll have the whole market covered. Now, I just need investors, although I’m not in a hurry cause I’m planning to be the one to fund it with my brothers.   The Philippines is the best place to outsource labor for a western market when the quality is not much of a concern. I can just see it now… FIGS that I would buy for my games…. At a price I can afford. For $100, I can have practically all the figs I can ever need for a game. That would be 20 mook figs, 10 other mook figs, 10 different monster figs, ad 5 character figs. In other companies that would cost me $200. hoody hoo!!!  With me doing my own advertising, production and quality control. I would be set… I just need capital… Which BTW would only cost me less than $5,000. Money I can save up in overtime and in less than a year…. He He He…. The gravy train is coming   I help and give jobs back home and I make just enough money to make the company expand, and all I get in return are free figs. What gamer can ask for more.   Hmmm… I can pay skilled laborers back home P4,000 a month on that ($72), in a place where the going rate for this kind of labor is 2,000 a month ($36) I can then increase their pay after every month by a grand. To 12,000. Capital would be $2,000, second hand stuff and some experts to help make a just the right acrylic formula for miniatures.  I think I just need a person to do the books and I’m set.   Hey Chat,  you interested? I need an accountant or someone who can help me with the books.   Hey Arj I’ll need you to take of business there while I finance it. I don’t know anybody else with the passion to make this work back home.   Damn…. I better save that capital soon. I want to drive the Miniature Prices to the floor as soon as possible.   God has the contacts, Buster has the foresight and Kezo has the PR.  Charles if you read this there is a job for you here. If You want to be paid to write this is your chance to write for a fantasy genre and for your axe heavy criticism.    A small business with friends… almost no risk and so much reward… Heck I’m the one taking care of the financial and looking for sculptors when I’m there and market over here in the states. All the guys have to do is what you are all good at.   A chance like this is worth the risk anyway… sez the guy who spent his whole savings on Christmas on a gold neclace for a girl who rejected him and turned into a dyke.   YEAH… Life is great

      Ok its the day before christmass...  dreamlessness (and not having word to repair any misspelings and gramar problems i would fail to correct) Its either i write a long boring entry of spice things ups with something short... or maybe both.   SHORT AND SPICY 	I'm happy... and its been a long time since i could say that.  LONG AND BORING 	I'm in america, i'll be leaving but will be comming back in less than six months. Its a brand new start, a whole new place and an entirely new life. Its one of the roughest places in america to live in... New Jersey. The place in america where they will sue your ass of for the slightest fault more often than anywhere else.   	"Ye throw the first stone..." is what i want to say to the people who are going to give me a hard time because of that.   	 There are trees here, woods for me to explore and meditate in. There is fresh are and places my imagination to run wild. Life here is different from back home, but better for me. Looking back, I have a better chance of meeting someone special here. Dispite the range of people here, at least there is a better number of them that would give me a chance.   	I guess I can kick my oath when i move here, cause if there is any other time to live my life, it would be here in america. Here an artist like me won't starve, Here I can build myself from scratch. I can pick up where i could not in the philippines and make a life so much better than i had before. Here every opportunity is all for the taking... all you need is to be able to work hard. I guess I'll be working really hard as well.  	I may not get a kick ass job... but I will certainly have one which i can hold with more dignity than back home. There is enough tries out here for me to get lucky and get the job i always wanted. I dont cost much to maintain... and all my money will be saved and used to help my ailing tito and tita. I will be together with my brothers and sister.   	Although at the cost of all the friends I'm leaving behinde, fate has conspired it to be easier on me since they are off to greener pastures. The guys from CSB all got good jobs and are getting better.  	The barkada all have good things instore for them as Buster gets his higher paying job in a cleaner environment... heck he gets to stay with his parents... i guess that would be cheaper in terms of rent. I bet he might even oneday buy a car... since the traffic there is not as congested.  	Kezo is finishing up his masters... He might go here one day and try to have a shot at citizenship... I know I would welcome him to our place to stay for the time he would be... and welcome his little woman if she could come along.   	Thomas will be studying in either London or Austraila... And RJ would be dving deeper into his studdies. There is not much people i will be leaving behind... its just that they are all leaving at the same time.   	Its a strange twist of fate or maybe a kind of destiny how all things have changed for me. A part of my life is ending as a new one begins.    DREAMLESSNESS  	I have no dreams here. How can i, when being here is living my greatest dream of all. A new life with opportunities. I'm not a 24 year old late graduate here, by their standards i graduated in time.  	I'm not lusty anymore, actually seeing what i've missed out back at home just makes me build up what i can here. What I failed to be for the philippines is what chance i have to be in America.  	I can finaly master my swordsmanship, my art, my professional abilites and my life. Its hard to stay sleep when i know i can be earning at least $20 an hour as a graphics guy or that overtime pays me 50% to 100% more. That the hours I work also builds up my value and if that fails... i can use my other skills. A place all my talents can be realized.... it feels like a maxed out a character and placed him in an environment he will excell rapidly. I can't wait...  	I can't dream... cause this is all to much like a dream...

      Ok i'm back from watching return of the king...  Its all i've been waiting for for the longest time... and i've now watched it and i... just feel empty.   I watched it... and i got what i wanted its just ... that maybe it wasn't what i wanted.  Ok... a little secret... when i first had sex.... I didn't like it. I just kept doing it till i learned to like it. Its just so many people said it was that good that i thought it was all and everything. I had more fun in the pre-sex activity than i ever had with sex. The pent up frustration was exhilirating and i walked around with a smile on my face all the time. I guess it repeats the saying that we don't know what we realy want.   Looking around here in the foreign land that will be my home after may. I just can't believe the opportunity it gives me compared to back home. Back home, there is no place for me as an artist. I guess i can pretty much say that I don't fit in with the needs the my motherland has right now. They don't need another artist to feed.   Here I can be an artist and still be able to feed myself. Since the standard of living is lower relative to how much people here earn... I can still improve in the other stuff that won't get me money... like my art.   everytime my officemates and my boss asks me what i really want... i end up dumbfounded i want to master my native swordsmanships style, get tattoes of ancient alibata saying something that really speak about me, i wan't to buff up cause i don't want to grow into a frail old man, i want to create a ton of art to vent my passions, and i want a chance to really live and carve out my own life without the restriction of poverty.   Even with these wants... i know they will change and they will differ as time goes bye. I just hope i will still be what i really fight really hard to see myself as.    I can't wait to start working. I can't wait to do things at my own time and with not so many distractions. I've been held back because of my inability to embrace life as is. I keep needing things to do and fullfill. I know they come from the lack of accomplishment in the eyes of my own insecurites.   I've told myself... if i can be good enough with my swordsmanship as that would be expected of a bagani, hone my skills as an artist and produce works to express myself unbriddled , and leave a mark behind... i guess i can really find happiness.   Although, i feel bitter about the fact that i could not do this in the philippines. I wish i would have the power to change things.... unfortunately... an actor, with no experience with politics, no degree with law or economics, no experience in leadership... has the best chances of winning the elections.   oh well i hope to get back to work on my thesis while i'm here. I already bought most of my x-mass gifts and have a special gift that the guys know is out of print and hard to find... big supprise!  Oh well... i just hope i can finish my work while i'm here.

      	I’m here in the states finally. I guess I won’t be reading my bro’s blog now that I’m here. So far it was a cool trip... cool in the sense that it was a number of accidents that didn’t really delay us but made it very harrowing.   	We had an interview with immigration. I dropped my greencard, but found it. Mel told me I could get 8 figs for $10, a dollar something for a fig. I can buy figs for practice and for the guys. I haven’t met up with thomas, and don’t know when I’ll see him given that I and he will have more limited internet access.   	I will have to keep my posts short given how cold it is here and it’s freezing my hands.   	I slept at around 8 and woke up 4:30am. We had buffalo wings, a lot of it, which was good. Now were waiting for everyone to get some momentum to get to work.  	Mel is asleep while dad is taking a bath.  	Looking at how well they are doing. I can’t wait to live here. I must look forward to a new life and a better one here. My home in the Philippines won’t let me be an artist and eat right. Here I have a chance. A small chance but the fact that I’m rearing to change my life for the better here hopefully I make my good home for me here.  	Me and Gaspar have made our minds in living in the suburbs. No cities for these nature lovers. And anyway I wouldn’t want such hustle and bustle in my life. I would be getting enough of that at work.

      Well I’m in CSB and I’m going to give my defense. I can’t find any other way to adjust my subjects. I’m here and I’m a bit nervous but were going to Gaspar’s second despidida or goodbye party later.   Today I went around school and don’t feel at home anymore. After OJT I feel changed like I am an adult… but what society at large defines as a productive member of society. I look at how much younger and younger the generation gets and how much in control I am over my hormones compared to last year and the years before that.   I wonder if I can ever pull off my won web comic. I’d love to do that. I’d post it on my blog cause I don’t want the hassle of having to start a webpage I could easily forget about and lose interest.   IMPROVEMENTS  Ok I’ve noticed I’ve been a bit self-centered recently and I have been unable look past my own needs and wants and help other people. Although, I’ve been lucky these past few days avoiding academic mix-ups and accidents... so far. But I count my blessings and find it too hard to help others when I find myself ducking at everything that comes my way. And again I’m making excuses.   WALKING AROUND  I have $40 I have to change to pesos cause our family has been spending so much for the trip. I couldn’t ask for money so I got the dollars I saved up for the trip and have to change it to pesos to pay for all the school printouts and stuff.    Well be talking more tommorrow when i have more time.

      CURRENT CRAP  I want to play GURPS. I know they are not the most newbie friendly system but you have to love its exacting properties. The logic and system is great… there is almost no way to MIN MAX since the disadvantages requires the GM to deal with the players heavy handedly… people think twice before taking one.   I like it more than the D20 mechanic and hope that one day… I can put GURPS on the map with several design mods I have in mind that requires less rolling, and newbie friendly. For now… since I really can be there to join and help I’m contented to use several of the designs I have for my own game system which is newbie friendly.   TABOO TOPIC  About guys and getting horny. Well recently a bunch of my male friends have had a increase in recreation requirements. I’ve noticed that I feel somewhat… well horny. I don’t get it though. Its been what… 9 months since I last got some, three years before that and sex wasn’t as good as I remember it (maybe cause I’m not a teenager anymore). So why am craving? I mean, I’ve never been desperate enough to count my money and consider booty.   When I was in high school I didn’t know anything about women and held the pretty ones on a pedestal. When I was in college I had crushes that nearly made me insane. When I had my first girlfriend I wanted to marry her and have kids as soon as I get a job and leave college. After her I wanted to be single for life. On my second girlfriend I thought of having a relationship for the simplicity of companionship. After her I grew over being lonely and realized how great it was being single. My last crush taught me that women I liked tend to crush my spirits unintentionally and tear away my will to live (he heh).   Looking back… and being were I am makes me ask the question “am I going through some phase… if it is I don’t want to recur.”   RELATIONSHIPS  Among my circle of friends and acquaintances I have learned how to maintain a relationship or the intimate nature. I know the requirements and what effort it entails, what to remember and how far should I go to help her and understand her.  My heroes are the nice guys, People who have been able to carve a piece of their share of happiness out of this terribly frightful reality. I was always happy to watch, listen and be there. I always admired how far they went to do what they thought was good and better in the long run.   Its just that I have taken a step too far and find myself unable to comprehend ever being in a relationship. In the age and the level I am now, I have to justify what I do in long term results.   Example; My hobby is time consuming and cheep, perfect for a guy who tends to be strapped for cash and easily bored. My skills and my lifestyle makes me flexible enough to take grunt work with humility.   I guess I see no point in one. Other than physical pleasure, I guess… but that would make me dependent on the person as a source of one… not to mention when the supply leaves what happens to me after. The great thing about sex is that like all experiences, they dull/or exaggerate with time, being unable to distinguish what it really is, it makes it easier for me to go on without it despite how much I used to be addicted to it.   An intercepting thought: The girls I really like make me like them more when their bitchy… to the point of dramatic violence…  then the thought of…. Just comes to mind. Damn it must be the cold in here.   HOPES BY 30  I hope by 30… … I have at least a 30 dollar an hour job… with my degree and ability in all. … to have at least 5 books out or the equivalent of that much work out.  … I have a big enough place for my brother and I, and our friends who will be staying over for a short while. …Have a completed a small work out gym.   …I will bulked up and balded, with a goatee and mustache …I have mastered my arnis enough to try joining tournaments again. …I get a really good dentist. …Have my own customized suit of plate mail, modern combat body armor (Kevlar) and high quality swords. …Sports goggles to replace my glasses. …I only have to work on my day job 20 hours a week.  …My other source of Income is Game related. … all my friends live nearby so that I can visit as well they can visit.

       THE GAME    First off I’m a gamer and I just can’t help but talk about the game last night.   We were playing the Warhammer 40,000 setting inquisitor campaign using Steve Jackson’s Generic Universal Role Playing System (GURPS).   We are part of an Inquisitor Entourage, 150pt (the equivalent of veteran) characters. We were on the trail of a weapon smuggling ring, which has occult connections. Our investigation was putting pressure on the smugglers that they had to play their biggest card. A rebellion that they were planning using the lowly mutant (not x-men but deformed humans) population.   All the planet’s mutant labor force began to rebel and we had to quell the largest one. It was in  mining complex. We were able to enter using some old maps to where some forgotten mine shafts exited.   In the first encounter in the mines… we found some mutant rebels, poorly armed and violent. We killed them making a lot of noise because my character did not make his stealth roll too well.   Oh yeah… my character is a cyber-upped veteran police detective like Zippowits in NYPD blue. Although he looks like a bearded and mustached Hugh jackman with his hair slicked back. Inspired by wolverine I have cyber arms with 3-bladed claws and a implanted ‘bolter’ (a standard heavy pistol).  Well we were surprised by 3 space marines (bio-implant enhanced soldier as stronger than a real world body builder armed with heavy power armor… they are the deadliest fuckers out there and we were out matched, they make stormtroopers look like fuck-dolls). And we had a 12 second fire fight that left our Ogre and Pilot crippled.  We then worked our way through the mines… I was tracking (I’m skilled but not great). But our inquisitor boss found the secret armory. We could not see. Dagu (the ogre played by kezo) heard something and threw the live and still full flamer at the direction. A 300 damage explosion occurred (enough to melt a tank) and a fire fight went on.   We fought another 5 space marines. Nell playing merrick made a roll that was 1 in a 1000x10. He killed a space marine with one burst to the head.  Kezo Killed 1 with his grenade launcher, and I went toe to toe with one wielding a sword that would cut me like a chain saw through cake. That was my highest moment.  1st second- I waited for him to open the door… there stood a guy who could take on a 20th century army by himself. I moved first and read his moves… I sliced his pistol and parried his sword blow. 2nd second- jumped back and knowing that I cant pierce his armor with my claws I let loose a burst fire to his head…right at the eyeslits… which must have been 2feet from my gun-arm. BLAM!!! 36 points of damage… the guys out. That was the time a 150 point character went mano-to-mano with a space marine which is at least 300 points and lived.   In the end of the encounter… I was still the only character unscathed.    MAN THAT WAS SWEET!!!  LATER   I’m wearing all black… going to Gamer’s Head Quarters in Glorieta 2, third floor. I’ll be running a game most probably no one will play… I’ll be there by 2 and leave by 4. I’m planning to be drawing since I don’t think people will try to play under a GM who doesn’t look like a geek.  He he…

       TIME  I should clock how often I spend thinking about gaming and doing things related to it. I think that would vastly improve how I do my work. I guess 2 hours a day concerning game related stuff (when it is just the run of the mill day) would be enough and 1 hour for stuff like Blogs, webcomics and reflection.   How I guess I should allocate my time  HRS---MON-----TUE-----WED-----THR-----FRI-----SAT-----SUN    Week is made of  168 hours I sleep 8 hours a day making up 56 I bum or sleep an extra 2 hours a day 14 hours I go around spending 1.5 hours moving around totaling 10.5 i spend 2 hours eating for the whole day 14 hours i work 6 hours a day making a total use week equal to 42 I exercise a total of 4 hours a week I spend maybe 2.5 hours in conversation 17.5  56 14 10.5 14 42  4 17.5 =158.0  hmmm… that’s ten hours missing? I wonder where that goes..  …Meanwhile in an alien space ship lab…  Alien 1: “where is subject 2 5 7… he’s late for his anal probe! We have to make our 10 hours a week quota in human rectal habits” Alien 2: “I think, that was last week’s project… we’re into lobotomies this week.” Alien 1: “Yes, Right… we are supposed to be studying the anatomy of a ‘loser’” Alien 2: “Here he is in sedated form” Alien 1: “Let us commence” Alien 2: “Sir, that’s not the where the brain is supposed to be…” Alien 1: “I know that… Its my experiement anyway stop telling me what to do… Alien 2: (grumble-grumble)“Jerk” Alien 1: “What was that assistant!!!” Alien 2: “I mean we have to jerk his ass up some more sir”  speaking of missing hours...   DAMN!!! Another post just disappeared!!! Where the fuck do they go! That was the second time today!!! SECOND TIME!!! Fuck at first I had to edit this post twice… cause it wont post properly now THIS!!!  WHY is it when I start posting about. BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ… something goes wrong.! What so fucking wrong with BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. Its like when is there an alien thingy that stops BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ from being understood … its like I only talking about BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ … then I said that hoochi would never do it… even if you paid her double or passed some stupid law to make it legal its just too fucking weird to BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ… Jeeze dude you could have just used a napkin… what the deal with BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ Don’t touch me man! I know what it is so don’t touch me or I swear I’m kicking your ass.  Jerk…  Oh well hope this is the last time or the rarest of times this will happen

      I’m writing the Appendix for my project report. I wish I had more time, I feel like I could write a whole new perspective on entering the market.  	I met an interesting speaker yesterday, his name was Ponch… or was it Potch… he’s the publisher of “The Reviewer” and Mobile Philippines. His views were great and I guess that’s cause its similar to mine. He game me the answers I needed but under the wrong context.  Context, that is he’s into multi-media more than me and into advertising. I just want to be an illustrator and writer. Although I find myself wearing the same shoes since I have ZERO experience when it comes too being in the marketing part of the book me and Thomas are writing.  I don’t know what else to do. I won’t be sleeping tonight trying to finish some drawings and some more works before Saturday rolls in. I need to show something. I have to clean up the system and add some more descriptions, not to mention create art… which should come after the writing of the book… since one of the writers is an artist.  Having a book RPG is a big NO NO… I just should have published a GURPS or RPG adventure. That would have been great, and easier. If people ask for a multi media aspect… they can clearly see the art for the badguys, layout and the booklet is all they would need as proof.  I wish I thought of that much sooner. Anyway…  I’d rather save it for that. I want to write long adventure books with maps, art and all paraphernalia a GM could ask of me. I also want to make character portraits for other people… given the specifications they like.   	HECK if anybody would be wanting some artwork… Wait a minute… I’m busy right now. I’ll do this while I’m looking for a job by MAY. That I know I’ll have time for.   	But anybody interested in somebody who does realistic art and not only portraits… but group pictures and the like… just leave a comment. I’m available after I graduate on may.   	Well back to work…

      Our GM has called the game off this Thursday. I was pretty ready for the disappointing news. Its also ok cause I am pretty busy and that would entail more work for my part… but the energy I could get off from a good game is so much worth the effort.   I didn’t go to work yesterday so that I could finish the game I designed for newbies. I have a feeling no one is going to play despite how well prepared I am for this one. I cut and pasted the book description of all the abilities and some of the rules into the character sheet so that it’s all there. I’m also preparing pictures for the characters both male and female.   I made the game with enough story to be told in 3 hours and enough combat for any hack’n slasher.   Well… I just hope I finish this all later.   ------------	Male---------------------------Female Paladin---	Norman Redus--------------Samantha Morton Rogue----	Brian Thompson (dwarf)--Anna Paquin Fighter---	Vin Diesel(Half-orc)--------Jeniffer tilly / China (Human) Sorcerer- Brad Refno-------------------Fairuza Balk Cleric-----	Joaquin Pheonix------------Charlize Theron   Well heavily edited BTW… I’ll use them for my other games when it calls for… I wish I was paid to do this. I’m a gamer with graphic artist skills… PLEAASE ISN’T THERE ANYONE OUT THERE LOOKING TO HIRE ONE!!!  I’m still tryuing to figure out what how to post images on my blog… I’ll post them when I’m done.  Ciao for now

       YESTERDAY   Soccer was great we played with a bunch of Koreans and had a great challenge. Thomas and I held the defense with Gill; Gab, Pat and Koko brought the midfield and Vince, Raul and … girl whats her face… was our attackers. Our goalie was Tonton.   The only disappointment we really had was the fact that we soon discovered we had to pay to play in ateneo!!! 300 pesos AN HOUR!!!… I have the good mind to actually call everyone I know who plays soccer and start holding events with about a hundred people… just to make that 300 pesos an hour hit the mark with so much feet trampling over the field.   Ughh… I mean, if I played in Southridge… we wouldn’t be charged simply cause were Alumni. and why would they??? I know there is field maintenance but they all colleges still suck money from the student population to pay for the field EVEN IF THEY DON’T KNOW IT OR FINISHED THEIR PE!!! They can’t kick out PAYING COSTUMERS!!!   Sometimes I feel like I should have been a lawyer… These are the times that I would be suing someone’s ass for being greedy… TOO FUCKING GREEDY. Me, Thomas and Rick should have been lawyers… simply cause: Like engineers we like maxing out what we are allowed to do, finding loop holes in the rules and most of all KICK THE BUTS OF SELF RIGHTEOUS JERKS!!!   I was just always afraid that given that opportunity I would sell my soul… having all that power would… well give me the knowledge of how to get away with what evil crap I wanted to do… and my Christian upbringing always said to avoid the Occasion of Sin. Which means when you know that your going to screw up… might as well avoid the situation when you’ll screwing up.   Damn… If I only knew someone powerful I can tell on… I’d like to see some justice my way.   I realized as I get older, as a child when you think your parents are being unfair… you grow up the world is… An artist I guess would be a whiner …if you take a grim perspective in the world… when every body does something... an artist bitches, “expresses” and just contemplates about how to best whine.   I am an artist by profession, and it’s for that reason I feel most helpless. If was wealthy… MONEY would certainly change that position, or had super powers. Both being unrealistic… and stuff I constantly ponder… I might as well just whine and draw up worlds where I get to kick the buts of those totally greedy jerks.      STARTING MY DAY   I still can’t find my ID… that BIATCH!!! Thankfully she’s gone.  I had a weird dream yet I forgot it. The first thing I grabbed waking up was Thomas’ dad’s dilbert comic book.  WORK FOR TODAY  Finishing touches for my:  - Project Proposal - OJT Paper - Armor Up Adventure Outline (4hour game)

      Well here I am again. In class doing this instead of listening.   I can’t help it. I’m worried sick because of my project. What I need is a producer, someone who can direct me in what to do. Either that or the other way around, someone to do what I need to do. I can’t be both. My attention narrows when I work so I can’t remember what priority my action was in the list of thing I have to do.   Dream: Damn I dreamed of my Ex. Well the first one. Its like she wanted to get back together again. Two years ago I would be her willing slave, now I’ve changed so much I don’t even know who she was.   People say when you love the memory would last forever. Wow, so I didn’t love her. I remember having so many stories about her that would make other guys knock their head back in surprise. Now I don’t know a thing about her. I just know that I had a girlfriend when I was in my second year of college.   The experienced is there ingrained, at least the lessons learned. I guess this actually goes for other guys. I mean, some guys are considered jerks or strange to other women when they try building a relationship. I can understand that some scars are old and deep and become some irrational fear.   I wish I discovered the joys of drinking when I had my first break up. Brain damage is not as bad as people think, healing means putting something new on something painfull and destructive.   PLANS  When I move back to the states I hope to start a game setting with my brothers as a part time job. I’ll be the Producer and head investor. Jobert can be the creative and literary force, I’ll draw and write a little but my place would be in getting things scheduled and done. Jasper’s task can be human resource, and basic management. Together we are creating a miniature line, setting, and RPG company that would fill a small niche.   A setting where RPGs will dictate the story and miniature battles will dictate the outcome of war. 2 elements that coordinate to create a rich and interactive setting where the players determine the direction of the story along with the GMs and have every opportunity to settle wars and epic battles.   A stepping stone to making a small company.  While I do this… I plan to also help Gino in penciling his graphic novel. I just hope I finish quickly enough to make all my requirements by march and begin the process of RELEARNING my drawing.    I love the fact that in America, you don’t have to go to college. If I was born there I would have just joined the army, learned military discipline, gotten a blue collar job and work with my head in my spare time.   Its either that or become a cop. That to would be fun.    BTW  I CANNOT ACCESS MY Homail cause the internet in school is too slow

      Ok… Alcohol  I haven’t drunk so much alcohol in my life since this past week. Its kind a hard to think positively about yourself … well myself in particular because of what has been happening.  Nothing makes feel so down when I’m time pressured to come up with art. I guess working for multi-media is not my strong suit. Its ok anyway, in America I can get any job… desk or otherwise and still be ok. Even at what may be 800 dollars a week or 5 dollars an hour I can still be pretty happy with what I do.   I don’t want to sound like I have no ambition. I can pull cool things off, but not for other people… especially people I don’t care about. I noticed that the best work of art I have ever made given my skill was for someone else mere pleasure.  I just can’t wait to go there… even if it means failing here. I’m burned out. I was working the whole of Christmas vacation. I’m working still today. Before that I was working 340 hours on a job while I balanced a12 units worth of school. I haven’t gamed as much as I want to. In fact I’m suffering game withdrawal so bad, that making characters is what I do just to stave of the pangs.   I want to run  a game… or play one with a rule savvy GM. I’m the type to play under Charles if I had the time, Cyril or any of Jobert’s group given their rules ability. I’d play under Rick if he was using 3.5.   Steven, the guy in the states did not make much for an interesting game. He doesn’t know that a captive audience is someone you should try to move ranging different emotions and feelings. (that was not a creative way of putting it)  Oh well I hope the internet at home gets fixed soon so I can do my work there.   Oh yeah I think i failed my defense... I just hope to get another try when i fix everything up again.

      Wow I got so much work done. Well I finished writing the adventure and all I need to do is paint some pictures and lay them out in PAGE MAKER!!!   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGHHHH!!!   IT’S FUCKING HARD!!! I CANT MAKE HEADS OR TAILS OF PAGE MAKER. I really don’t know how to start. All I know is that I have to get it all done by FRIDAY morning. Which to me is being able to finish it all by Thursday night cause I need sleep.   God gave me my extra day. I can’t complain. He took my Lolo and gave me one more day to work. I’m in class right now trying to figure out Page Maker. If I survive I will celebrate.  Oh yeah… Saw Father Jim yesterday. He is the priest that unfolded everything to me one day. It was when I drove Jobert for Father’s day. I tried to go to confession and he was too busy socializing. It was then did I realize how much of crap Opus Dei was. I was sick and I felt like I was dying and he would not hear my confession. I was… you could say so broken and so afraid of death. Realizing all the more what I chose to ignore… eventually sex pushed me farther than everything else and that’s how I became an Agnostic.  Its weird but there is more too it. Although I wouldn’t care to explain.   Oh yeah mentionables…  Saw a crazy man in a dress walk in front of my car while waiting on a stop light. I said out loud that “you don’t see that everyday.” Patrick goes “Uh-huh”. Then Candy and Trish were going WHAT!!!  Joan Nicolo my Cousin is part of my Friendster list now. I hope to get my other cousins too and anybody else in my past I can try to contact.   I worked out today. I hope to be bigger and fitter when I go back to the states. Even as a Tall Asian I’m smaller than the average American I have to get bigger just so that I can be able to defend myself. It sucks when you throw punches bigger guys can overcome… although give me a stick… an umbrella, pipe, or a branch I can defend myself against a guy who has a knife and the advantage of size.   I was thinking of buys swords back here when I found a blade store in Makati Cinema Square but there is no way I can get that past customs.   Thanx to Patrick, Trisha and Henry for coming to the Wake. It was the most fun wake I have ever experienced. I really loved the part about the Accounting and Shitting analogy… I don’t know accounting so it was really funny for me.   Oh well I guess I’ll just study these three hours PAGE MAKER in a class I’m supposed to learn DIRECTOR

      I saw my Lolo’s Old pictures yesterday. Everyone said I looked like lolo the most when he was young, and Lolo looked like my great grandfather when he was young. Jonathan, our cousin was the splitting image of his dad, tito Sonny. Dale looked just like tito Danny, and TJ looked like Tito Marlon.   Looking at the Pictures of them as Kids, I begin to understand a lot of the things that happened now. You can mentally age them and see what happened over time.    I saw pictured that dated back to as far as 1948 to 1956 when our great grandfather was still alive. It was pretty interesting in how things developed.   I was talking to Randy… the son of Tita Su and Mang Danny. We got into talking about things to come. I told him where things began. I told him the funny thing about how I love eating in their dinner, and how that was the business of my grandfather and great grandfather.   If you look far enough into the past, you notice things repeating. Faces surfacing again and again. My dad looks most like my lolo, when you look at the eyes and when these traits passed on to me, and I had a long face… more of a square face. I looked like my lolo.   So when I look at someone, there is a chance I may be looking at their granddad or parent at that age. I know its an old idea, but I’m looking at it at the time my grandfather died. The first grandparent of mine to die.   I’m turning 25 this year and I feel like by the time I’m 30 they’re all going to be gone. Its like something I’m not prepared for, yet I have this coming a long time now. The average death toll is 60 back here. People who live to 70 are considered very old.   Although, looking at my health and my lineage I might go to 90 like my great grandfather. He was 20 when rizal was killed. He was 22 during the Katipunan Revolt the Spanish American War. Although he had a family when he was pretty old at the time.   When I die… I hope it is in some 50 mile hike, or banging 5 women, or in a war where I’m fighting on the good side. I don’t want to wait to die. I don’t believe one should wait for death to come, when it is much more to live a life charging at it.   I wish by the time my kids are 20… at least my youngest. I can start doing crazy things. And in terms of funerals, the cheapest damn box that won’t let the smell out. No, ceremonies… just a big party with all the family left. Heck a game. If I can have my way, I’d be a ghost to make my children’s life much more interesting.   That would be cool, to be a story telling ghost. ESPECIALY a GMING GHOST!!!  Gaming is the instrument that Fathers will be close to their sons, and I wouldn’t want that tradition I hope to start, end with me.   I have a lot of work to do… and I didn’t get any work done yesterday because of the request mom made and the tiring search for Candy’s documentary.  I hope I get something done by today.

      I haven’t Updated for a whole week…  My grandfather Died yesterday at before 6 pm. It was weird cause when I saw him earlier I wondered how he could still be alive. His legs have shriveled away into just bones, his face is more of a skull with his jaw locked open, and his were eyes screaming. I thought he was trying to say something… His eyes were looking at me as if the words were being formed by his frozen mouth.   I went to him, but I’m no psychic, I could not glean the meaning he wants me to read without words. He began to move violently, the nurse said that he just needed his head tilted up. But, a thought came that when he saw me that was what triggered his violent reaction.  His eyes were darting back and forth between my dad and me. I could not tell what he wanted to say. But it seemed important, enough to say at his dying moments.   Fortunately I don’t feel anything, other than that my luck has turned bad. I feel like something else would be coming. I’m afraid to leave the house and I’m trying to keep myself busy.   I was not close to my grandfather. My most colorful memory of him was when we visited him after mass, my father, me, jobert, jasper and candy. He would walk like an old man would. He would get the food he prepared for us and would watch us eat. That was two years ago. That time, Leonardo’s Lechon was still draped with some prestige and people still came to buy my Lolo’s Lechon.   It got me thinking about how so much history has just past and so much pain we still endured. We still pay for the 60 million dept my uncle… my godfather made when he died. He was a man of vice who was stealing from my grandmother and buying her gifts with her own money.   My Grandfather knew about that, and we all didn’t want to tell our grandmother cause it would just break her heart. Leonardo’s was the product of my workaholic grandmother, and my classic Filipino Grandfather. The banks owned everything under their noses cause of my uncle… and that was painful.   I remember when my uncle would always have a get rich quick scam… and my dad would tell him it was unethical. They would not talk to each other for long periods of time.   I don’t want to use my grandfathers death as any excuse. I hear it to often among my classmates. Their excuse for absence is a death of an uncle, aunt or grandparent. It would matter if the person was really close I guess. But I see no devastation in their eyes when they say it, just the quiet expectation that the excuse would be noted and taken.   Its disrespect for the dead more than the living using the dead as such an excuse.   Thanx for the condolences for those whose heard the news.    In other news… a busy day today. I will finish the work on the written adventure HOPEFULLY today with some character drawings at poor quality. I have to buy page maker and learn it on the spot. Hopefully its not too hard.   With my grandfather’s wake… my schedule has become more hectic. I hope I can get through this week in one piece.

      I’m back in the Philippines.  My boss as asked me to help him write a novel about Vietnam and how it would have been if America remained. I guess it was light from how America faired with Iraq. Its so cool to have an ojt concerning book writing.   I bought the Philippine Ancestral Houses and it was worth every cent. The book is so well made, I have to say it was glad to buy it before it was sold out. These kinds of works are good for the country. Knowledge brings appreciation, and this appreciation helps cultivate well being which is so needed.  As soon as I arrived I had the most pleasant surprise. Patrick and Trisha visited us. It was a great surprise. Actually, on the way from the airport I was thinking of dropping by Pat’s place so that I could surprise him and arj. But they beat  me to the punch.   Sunday was pretty cool I got to play soccer and we won… 8 to 4. Again I played for the Korean dominant side. The fathers who were with us remembered me and were happy to let me join their side.   Again I have the worst rapport with my fellow country men cause I hate how they embarrass Filipinos by their poor sportsmanship and their tendency to hog the ball. That’s why I stopped playing for them BTW. I can’t get along with jerks who embarrass us on an international scale.   Pat was with me in ton ton’s place.  I checked out the La Salle Porn I heard of and felt really bad. I thought it was going to be something… well dirty. But when I saw the video I felt bad cause I know that girl didn’t intend that vid to appear for the whole world to see. Mixed feelings pushed back and forth as I was just so curious to know what happened to them afterwards. Was she expelled? Did I know her? Whose fault was it? At the same time I felt ashamed for contributing to the number of people who can now spot her on the street and a picture of her in the vid in my mind. How embarrassing for her… and a shame.  As a guy… I know that if the guys was seen… every hot blooded male would give him a thumbs up for getting the girl in the vid.   Anyway right now I’m editing my System… I’m planning to get it copyrighted by this week and layout by next week for presentation.

      I'm an agnostic. I don't belive in religion but i believe in a god. Back home, in the Philippines people condemn anybody who  not catholic. But remember that i'm speaking in my case, not in general.   A background   I was educated in the metaphysics and theology of thomas aquinas in southridge school for boys (which ironicaly claims not to be a catholic school so that they don't have to let their teachers and students off on catholic holidays... another way to cheat for money) ... i also am a rules lawyer. Always trying to understand the rules better than the average joe so that i could be sure where i stand in my spirituality.  Today my mother was threatening us that she would lock us up back in the philippines and ruin our lives if we did not go to mass...  pause for the dramatic irony. (insert tune of jepordy) A woman who says things like that doesnt exactly live up to the  virtues the faith would require.   I'm no expert... but i can't stay in a religion where it is not exactly catholic(by means of universal). When factions of the  church fight over aspects that would consider a human act a sin and damn him to hell when he contributes to the greater good.  Like so what if I jack off... i'm not a repressing how i feel only to unleash it in a violent act or crime. Or suppressing them only to twist them into lurid facinations or obsessions (or am i)  I guess one has to think about what is a religion. If one is part of one dont they have obligations to fulfill (or less they fall into damnation)  Well, I don't want to be catholic... I'm sick of my spiritual credit being deleted every time I wack off. Thats right, by  the current demands of the church... you start from zero when performing a mortal sin. All your spiritual credit goes down the drain. Even if you'v tried so hard to be good and you quiver and have anxiety attacks being around girls you like... people would think your a pervert.   A side note: Since genetically i'm predisposed to be a geek... since my grandparents and my parents aren't that fun loving its pretty hard to fight genetics.   I can list a number of flaws the Catholic Religion has in terms of rules. A lot of them illogical(don't give me the faith crap) and unforgiving. The kind of nonesense that a cheating boyfriend would use to give the girl his fucking an excuse to drop her pants, INO sweet talk and foundless arguments.  and as much as I love to have sex again, I would not sweet talk a girl and lie (two different things btw) to get sex... I wish though i could get sex for humor.

      SATURDAY I ran my game and found it ok… despite it took me a while to get the characters rilled up but that should be expected when they just made their characters and need more time to understand them and have a clearer idea of them.   Majed and Paul were great players of course the same goes for Gino and Ton Ton. At least I didn’t have to worry of the game going to the dogs. My other group isn’t as serious and loves to revel in slapstic anime comedy in midst game. Its ok., I mean that’s there cup of tea. I for one like a dark mood so that when I bash monsters I can get some of my aggression out of the way.  I hear that 2 other guys are joining… but I hope that they are worth it if they do join.  GAME I put them on a mystery plot. Slowly began introducing characters and after most of them had been introduced I began my first murder. I already placed enough clues for the party to figure out the motive of the murders and all they have to do is start digging.  Every murder will be easy to read… given that the characters are incredible intelligent… no one has an INT lower than 14… so they will figure it out.    SUNDAY  Well I’m going to soccer today. I just hope we find a field to play in.   Jobert showed me a cool article which I can’t wait to read cause it would really help me improve my swordsmanship. I want to join those medieval fighting orgs when I move. I want to improve my fighting skill to have the Philippines represented well in such circles. Anyway what I have learned about the my culture’s fighting style is adapt or die. An unusual tradition given that it is the greatest gift passed on by each master to the next generation in this culture of martial arts.  Well of to soccer

      WEDNESDAY It was a fun day… I just hate my phone… I’m using mom’s phone now. Even now its still acting up. I can’t get calls and miss my text-ses. I really have to apologize to someone for not being able to make my phone work. I should have started calling landline… I almost ended up acting like a prude.   He he… I was kinda lying about knowing where tomas morato was… I made the mess of not being on time anyway… so I wanted to make up for being late. But the day was so hot and we had two cars… Tomas Morato would have been a better meeting spot in the long run… if there was a theater or something?!?   THRUSDAY It was a tiring day…  I went to a class which didn’t occur, a free cut, yay(sigh).  I had 1 barbeque which fortunately had no fat, tofu, one cup of sinangag and my favorite camto soup.  I went to Virra mall to take advantage of the guarantee… I played with the sales lady’s kid for a while while Jo fixed my computer. I drew batman for him and robin… he and she was happy that I provided some entertainment and conversation to make the day more interesting After that I went to fetch henry Cyril and charles for our game Beng didn’t give us combat but there was a lot more waiting for us next game. I should have started a fight… but I a sor, I don’t start fights… as an enchanter I make people fight each other. Well the next session seems to be combat intensive  FRIDAY Chatting with Rick… I’m ending the campaign I began 4 years ago in CSB. With that I hope I inspire rick to make that graphic novel about his character.  GAME  i made powerfull monsters... no need telling the PCs the average hero is 10th level... let them enjoy the 1st level with a gritty and mortal game where 3rd level is the best they can hope for

      The past must be something isn’t it. I have to admit, I have done everything wrong. I started out in a relationship that was purely physical which I had mistaken for love, been in and out of colleges, and damage my better than average health.   I began with hiding behind blind faith and God. I was suicidal and really was shit for brains.   But I guess things do have to start somewhere.   I’ve gotten over my naiveté. I have embraced life and the fear of death that comes with it. I have learned the importance of friends and family and not to look for “the one”.  I have also learned to work and succeed.   These are lessons that I have not fully mastered but principals that I have come to understand and open my mind to fill. In the journey getting here I have to admit that I would love liked for my decisions… but caring about what others think… not what those who care about me are two different things. Caring what is good for me and not to take anything that was given to me for granted.  I do admit… I miss being wild. I miss getting my blood pumping and at the sight of a woman who looks at me in a certain way. I miss getting horney that I get all stupid and forget everything I ever learned. I miss having a body that can sleep 3 hours a day and run, I miss being able to enjoy the “company” and being able to perform to impress. I’m not twenty anymore and my metabolism is not what it used to be.   I miss pig-ing out four cups of “sinangag” with the viand of my choice. I miss being able to run and chase my cousin on a bike, I miss being able to spar the way I used to with my younger brother at the back of auditorium at school before x-mass play practice.   I miss being 20 and being able to dream and not worry about having to make them real just yet. Being able to run games for 6-8 hours, being able to have a crush on a girl who just walks into the room, or having never having to think of the worst and only the best in people.   25- means I want to work. I have to work so that by 30 I have something to show for. I may not be after a fast car or a big TV. I may not be eating all the fries I can ever make for my self or my favorite instant food, I may not be going out as often as it would be ideal for a man… but in the next 5 years I will become someone my aspirations have been trying to reach.  A man skilled in his people’s arts of war, to be an artist with real meaning to what its ideas stand for, and to be independent and capable. Virtue, Grace, and Industry counts for three things I want to master by 30. I may not have a lot of money by then… a good credit rating would do just fine, but a place to go home to where my Family of Friends are close by.      SUNDAY  We were kicked out of Ateneo by the grounds keep. Even if we had a permit given to them they are expecting a bribe from their tone… a bribe we cannot afford. I hate elitist crap… I’m not elitist in my games neither am I about who my friends are and where they come from. I believe if someone wants to play and there is a field… let them play… a tithe for the grounds aint bad… but to STEAL and to PUT people down just because they want to play is something terrible.  I may not like Ateneo with its elitist culture… I came from la sale and UP btw and I have never been introduced into such crap as I have felt when I am there. If there is anything I can say by my right as to giving an opinion I hate those people who think they are better off than everyone else just because of money.  HELLO!!! We live in the Philippines!!! WHERE 90% of the wealth old families and institutions were STOLEN FROM PEASANTS!!! SO NO ONE SNOT NOSES THE WORKING STIFF!!!  IF I CAN DO ONE THING WITH A FIST FULL OF THOUSAND PESO BILLS IS SHOVE IT UP THEIR ASSESS THEN DOWN THEIR THROATS!!!    NO ONE AND NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO THINK THEY ARE BETTER WHEN THEY ARE BORN WITH A SILVER SPOON! I MEAN NO ONE! IF THEY THINK THE MONEY IS SOMETHING PERMANENT THEY HAVE SOMETHING COMING!  I SWEAR I WILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY WHEN I GO ABROAD. I’LL WORK MY ASS OF AND THERE WILL BE PAY BACK FOR ALL THOSE RICH SNOTY BASTARDS WHO DON’T KNOW A HARD DAYS WORK!!!  PHILIPIINE HISTORY IS LITTERED WITH THE TRAITOROUS BLOOD OF THE “PRINCIPALES” (The Philippine Elite) Betrayal after Betrayal have been instrumented by them… no justice have come… If there are any old gods left I pray they give me the power to exact the revenge and justice their children so wish  that the deeds will echo into the very heavens.   Strangely Half of me can be traced back to the Aristocracy of old from my mother’s side… and the other half… peasants. I don’t know how but I will find the strength and drive to make a change even if I am thousands of miles away…   I’m just 25 but in 10 years 35 and 10 more 45… enough time… just enough time for me to cull them when they least expect it.   I really wish one day to be counted as a Bagani… A justifier… isn’t that a Philippine translation of my name of birth anyway… I pray that the forgotten gods and souls give me their strengths… creativity and ingenuity… as well as filling my allies with such graces… God knows I can’t do this alone.    What would be cool if I can make a story out of this… I can wack it into every Filipino how much it is in their hands to make that change. If I could be a politician to run for president… I would be… but if I ever would be… I wish I would have the strength, intelligence and allies to help me pull it off.   An artist for the president would be quite a change. But a hero would be so much better… just like the men of character during the revolution and world war II such as Quezon and Bonifacio.

      Well I’ll be off to soccer… I just shouldn’t forget to text everyone about the game today… but since everyone know about it by now I’ll just save the text money and use for something else.  Hope to eat in national sports grill today. Nothing like unlimited firecracker fries.  I finished two paintings yesterday. Well I hope that’s all that I’ll need. Well That’s the most I’ll try to need.  I have a craving for a damage dealing character. But I guess there is a compromise. I can be an enchanter with one favorite damage dealing spell. That would be cool enough.  I’m hungry and will be off to soccer soon so this will be it for now.

      I woke up… Forced my self to wake up from this bizarre dream.  It was about a ghost who spent his afterlife protecting his son. There were these creatures that came from the darkness. Small like goblins, and were intelligent. They made sure only to move in shadows and unseen. One would think you were crazy until they come upon you and drag you to the shadows and killed… feasted.   I was an extra in the whole senario… or was I. I remember teaching this woman about the power to turn and courage built on hope and faith. A desperate kind of courage… that can allow one to fight under the circumstances her mind cannot. A blinding courage… desperation that has been helping me fight them for the longest of time.  Moderately armored… I looked pretty much conservative since my weapons and armor did not stick out and no one knew what CRAZY shit I was doing.   I was killing goblins and there was this ghost that helped me… he taught me something’s… he was not my father. But his son lived blissfully unaware of what was happening. The Goblins were scary since they lived in the shadows and fought in them.   They could be hiding anyway… a movie cliché… they could be in the car with you while you drive. Waiting till they can bring their knives to my neck. It was like that the whole time. I don’t remember sleeping… cause when I did it must have been short and terribly needed.   The dream already ended as the farther confronted the son with something. They saw each other and it seems like many things were healed and put to rest. He gave him three swords… a dagger, a shortsword and a bastard sword. I was jealous but it was cool.   Then we proceed to finish up… until my alarm woke me up.

      I was in a quandary. I realized that guys have a better chance at going for girls younger than them.   That just proves that men are lesser than women, if anything else to a world where women feel like the lesser of the two genders.  In my experience, the women I have had a crush on are pretty close to my age. Well by my standard a maximum of less than 5 years difference is ok with me. Given that my grandfather is 8 years older than my grandma and that my great grandfather bettered that by 12 years ( 20 years older).   It’s just that all the girls around my age always had a boyfriend or “lover” who was always 4-8 years older than them. These were also the girls I liked and I felt pretty bad that these guys have already had their accomplishments to show for. It’s these accomplishments that so matter that makes all the guys of the girl’s peers seem so immature or useless.   I always had the fantasy of growing with someone through adolescence. It would have been a cool trip to be there as two would grow older with one another. But as I grow older I realize why would some girl stay with some guy who can’t support her or if ever they get into trouble take care of her.  I admit I’m jealous of the older guys who get my female peers who I like. They could be ten years older than me and get my crush. Honestly there is one guy I know who has that difference with me in those years who I don’t mind winning over my crush.     They say women like men who they can change and men like their women to stay the same. It is quite funny to see that a man who is an old dog is being taught new tricks, while a growing young lady is expected to stunt her growth.  I’m looking forward to the time I would grow old to have a girlfriend half my age… or on the average 3/4th my age. Like every guy and his gadgets always getting the new model that comes by every 2 years.   I know this might sound so… piggish to some people. Its my opinion anyway. It would take a good 10 years before that would ever happen and I guess having gone through this kind of adult hood I feel like I deserve it.   There is no harm if both parties are after flings anyway. Just remember that an older guy can pay for a weekend retreat to Hawaii or  some romantic get away than the other guy…. And if you’re the girl who has the heart enough to see past waiting for change in a man and accepting him as he is then good for you… enjoy the guy who is near your age. Don’t expect expensive gifts (“bribes”) from him though. Not a shopping spree, nor a free spa treatment when ever, or a car… and someone who can be a financial umbrella despite economic independence.   When I get old… and come back here. I hope I have made enough wealth to start buying the new models that would come out of the wood work. I’m sure living my youthful fantasy is the way to live. And the other guys out there… you may be old… you may not have those looks, you may not have to scrimp and save anymore, no more small apartment, or cheap dates. You come back home to the Philippines… your around 35 unmarried… working out in the Gym. No kids, A dollar account, and American. Its Christmas everyday.   Social Events your invited to try to cash in on you hard work, GROs, young ladies who just started working or are in their OJT. You come in with such youthful humor and playfulness. Your 35 you can bide your time and pick from the litter. You have money, You have security and you have a citizenship to a country that won’t try to screw itself over.   You have 10,000 peso dinners, as well as find 10,000 peso ass. You are from here and know what ass is worth 10grand. Not to mention, you have the charms to maybe bet more BANG for your BUCK!  I wish my boss would take me cruising with him and I wish I get to choose the chicks he bangs. I mean… women he bangs, I mean I think being a fil I would know what ass would be hotter… he can’t distinguish us anyway.   I’m watching Legend of the Condor Hero that shows at 11:00, 4:00 and 7:00. everyday. Now living life with only love and a past-time of combat not to mention a woman who loves you… (being pretty is a bonus)

      GAME DETAILS  The Primer…  You wake up in a cold dark room. Pinpoints of light which you make out to be from candles can be seen in the far edges of this make-shift infirmary. You hear the sound of heavy breathing and coughs.   You remember a battle... no, its scale was far greater than any battle you remember: It was a war. It was the last battle of The War of Heaven. One of epic proportions fought in a frozen valley between two jagged mountain ranges. Armies of great heroes marched to breach a Fortress of Beautifully Sculpted Ice and Fire.   You remember those moments… the intense cold that froze your grip on your weapon and staff. The terrible fear that rumbled in your chest as you breathed in the northern air, the songs the Ice Sirens Sang to seduce its army into a rage and tear the hope from your heart.   You remember the sharp frozen winds against your face freezing the expression of desperate conviction. You met your foe in the battlefield, with the fire of magic and the fortitude of hammered steel. With memories of those you loved and those who came before you in this greatest of sacrifice… you fought with every passion you can draw from your soul.   You were struck down with the tears warming your face as you cried desperately to re-enter the fray. You don’t want to die… not just yet… when there is so much more to be done.   Someone stabbed you from behind. A flash of black magical Frost cut through you and you remember nothing else.   THE DREAM  You are back in the world… that was just a dream. You dreamed of something fantastic that you can just tell yourself that it must have been one good movie. But you can’t remember the name. You can’t remember your identity but the face of stranger staring back at your in clear and rippling waters. You see yourself in the window of a classroom, with strangers who’s names you can say but whose relationship you cannot understand.   You remember the feeling of helplessness and weakness. You remember the feeling of being unable to rise above mundane challenges and that your limits are that of only someone human.  It was a world of less hope and fallen ideals. It was a life of simplicity and complex relationships made by complex decisions. Explanations hammer into your consciousness trying to piece together envy, obsessions, desire, insecurities and depression.   THE REBIRTH You feel water touch your lips as a extremely short stocky man give you water from a wooden spoon. You remember that he is called a dwarf or in his language: Urden. He looks at you places his stubby and calloused hand on you and push his thumb onto the center of your forehead. He prays: not in anyway you recall… he speaks to someone who is not there and thanks for the reply.   Wounds begin to mend, torn muscles rejoin, creaks smoothen and blisters and sores cool. Other than ripe and dirty bandages, your fine. As you look around. You wish you can say that about everyone else as well.    CHARACTERS  Rebirth is a story set in a soul’s rebirth into the land of fantasy and legends. The lives they have lived in modern times shaped the form they now possess. Men is the common flock, gifted for their versatility and balance. The Urden are those who lived with stout warrior hearts and codes. The Fey are those who lived their lives in dreams and imagination.   The Orcs were those corrupted and cruel in their past lives, The Giants Tyrants and Slavers, the goblins the cowards and sloths, and the deceivers and traitors the formless enemies who lie and wait in the dark.  Dwarves AKA Urden (Earthen) Elves AKA Fey  …. THE PLAYERS  Vicente was Well one is a bard half fey and grifter in the modern life. Another character is a human rogue aka jack sparrows, Ricky is a green orc or a redeemed orc which is the opposite of the normally redish orcs, Nico was cop in his modern life who is now a kick ass monk with stats that matches.  The roll is 12x for a set of 6, one may try again… but with 2x less per try (of course until a 6 set)  They did ok but unoriginal characters lack the drive and ability of more original ones. Original characters stand to make memories .  GAME REALIZATION  What’s the point having a horse familiar. I realized that at L7 wizard I can have a 6HD , large familiar and the strange thing about it having a better familiar, the familiar still has to start with HALF my HP! On the upside it does not reduce the familiar powers as it would do to special mounts.   I wanted a Black horse for a familiar… a beautiful black horse that can be intelligent and (using awaken spell… since it is a magical beast improved familiar allow it as my familiar) awesome looking. Although my first concept was a wolf… a horse how ever is not a lesser animal, it notably should be smarter than a wolf… and with some of my skills given to it… it will certainly be more interesting.    So the best Familiar bearer I see is a Dwarf for his massive HP and several other combinations… such ass  Ape (a gorilla) this familiar can really use the skills given by its master and when you cast enlarge it would be more dangerous. Its weaker than a bear but at least you can get it in an earlier level.

      PAINS  I saw chez today… from a distance. I know she avoids me… but its not like I ever did something to be considered the plague. I mean, I said I liked her in the most childish and stupid way but I don’t think I could be considered dangerous. Immature maybe but not dangerous.  I guess this is why I don’t care anymore. I told myself once this is my last chance. I was stir crazy about a girl and it seems like it was ages ago.  At least now in the way I live my life it wouldn’t matter if I was a geek or nerd. I’m with my friends and family. You don’t hear that come from my mouth often. Guys like me have a hard time from distinguishing when we’re cared about… especially when we’re coming from a rebellious adolescence and we can’t help ourselves. As an adult I can now see what is more important and how much more unreal romance is.   As a guy who is 25 my opinion of love is that it only happens when your young. And when it does happen it can last the rest of your life. Unfortunately not everyone can find reciprocated love in their teens. And the rest of the world have to deal with being disillusioned and pained… Of course that’s until they grow up and have other people to care about to make them happy.   I can easily put into words why I want to have a kid of my own. If you don’t give a mushy sentiment about it… I can say a kid of my own is a measure of how mature, understanding and patient I have grown through the years. A child will reflect the best of me, by how much I can do to help him grow and become ready for the world.   I’ve learned not to expect anything else from him except that he would have the values and principles I hold… and he should show me when I’m beginning to be lax in them. It’s a child’s rejuvenated mind which can help us relearn the ideals we lost when we put away our innocence.   FEAR  I felt fear grip me the first time in a long time. Fear if I should go to her and say hi and see for myself everything is all right. I was afraid of her, when I’d walk alone in the dangerous places, leave my wounds untended, and have no fear of jumping of heights that daze me.   As a teenager I though I was invincible. I guess I was. I can walk off falling off my height when I made a bicycle kick, I had a new wound twice a week from rough sports and rowdiness. Now, I can feel my back give, I get rashes from something I don’t know what, I can’t beat a bunch of old timers in soccer.   When I choose to love life… I gained the fear of it all. When I chose to forsake Religion, I doubt I will ever reach heaven. Being older I forget why I changed the way I did.   HABITS  I sleep 8 solid hours everyday. But I sleep at around 3… leaving me to wake at around 11:30… and still terribly sleepy. I get up and turn the computer on to see the latest comic.  I try to remember what I am supposed to do while I fiddle with creatures I am planning to use on my players.   GAME yesterday  Well I was the most somber GM they had. They are not used to weak characters. They can’t help make jokes… thankfully they were too corny for me to laugh at and encourage the disruption.   I like my adventures dark… heroic and neigh impossible. Its just what the doctor ordered. Beating the odds with an ugly stick is something I live for. When I give the players this chance… it is this chance they will face their dreams or nightmares on a battlefield where they will live or die.. both a reward.   They were all playing unoriginal characters… all except nico. I was hoping they put more effort in it. I am pretty good as a GM and I feel like I deserve something better than that.   Well I hope the gamers on Saturday will be easier to enthrall

      No test today but still I have work…  GAMES It might be a lame idea but I think it is a way newbies can find familiarity and comfort under a new GM.   As a GM who loves maxing out monsters despite the fact that I don’t surprise players with encounters but make it something they can tell from how the story telling escalates, I was hoping to start a new set of games.  I guess I’ll call it my Renaissance Game… or “Rebirth”… players play themselves reincarnated into someone who had just found his memories of his past life revived by the trauma of death… The characters lived their lives the same way as they did in the present and wake up to have memories of two lives… the life they have now and their own life of before… they just can’t remember how they died or how they lived their lives.   Convenient but here is the twist..  Everything they thought of the after life is here… the horren are called the corrupted souls… they are those souls of bleak desires and terrible Malice. The Elves are the Feries creatures of Dreams or Dreamers… Men are simple souls with versatility and shit, dwarves are souls of (hardcore gamers) and men who saw the life the way dwarves did: work and war (makes for the reason there are not much female dwarves). There are no halfings or gnomes…   So the life they left behind is an afterthought to a life of fantasy. They soon realize that the afterlife’s dangers are far greater than their life in modern times since in a land of magic what is impossible is possible and evil can corrupt physically anybody into a powerful creature that is called the Horren… then later evolve into true deamons…   Aasimars or the blessed are those who died with the greatest of sacrifice in their past lives. The people who died miserable and starving like that in Africa and Parts of Asia are Aasimars… their simple life combined with their extraordinary endurance to live a life with hope are transformed by their purity into the aasimars… NOTE THAT NOT EVERYONE WHO DIES IN THIS WAY BECOME AASIMARS… only those who died with a saintly disposition after helping everyone else forgetting themselves.  They wake up in a war… in the beds where magic of faith and goodness cures them. They wake up after being nearly slain in battle protecting a village, their family and loved ones to no avail. The camp is deserted but for an old dwarf avatar(cleric).      oh well thats it for now I have other work to do

      God I can’t sleep… cause I’ll probably fail this test tomorrow… but I’ll make it up by finals. Its not that I’m lazy. Reading my past posts one can figure I intentionally made my other grades suffer just to pass this requirement.  Thankfully I’ll be running games soon. This will sharpen my mind.   LEAVING FOR THE STATES  I will miss everyone here. Leaving here has given me the courage to do the things and say the things I never thought I would be able to. Knowing you may never see these people again or things will change to much as well as I will be changing I feel like a form of death is approaching so I try to make my peace.   Responsibility waits for me in the states. Its all a new adventure…   BEING A CHARACTER  I’m graduating at 25… somehow I knew my life will begin in this round number. And seeing myself as a character this is the way I put my self in perspective.  Fighting Ability: Enough to survive a fight against a stronger opponent if the opponent doesn’t have any martial discipline. Canny enough to win if there are tools for him to improvise with even against unlikely odds.  Examples: Recently improved in my local fight club. Recently learned how some katas are designed to take on multiple opponents. I learned I can’t strike with my hands for any damage on a person… but if I kicked someone (from soccer experience) my shin leave a nasty bruise… not to mention I tend to aim at joints and fight dirty.   Social Ability: Competent can do enough to get along with people. With effort can impress and turn them around… unfortunately he can’t maintain them well since his attention drifts. Can Con if pushed or needed but only as a last resort or when there is no risks involved. Oh yeah and RJ struck me when he said that I can really raise morale if I wanted to… ( a secret between you and me is that I meant it, anyone can tell how I lie by the amount of hesitation or fore thought I put in one… I can’t lie on the fly) Examples: Did stand up in class when I was bored and too lazy to prepare anything… got the highest grade possible. Talked a friend from being beat up by a crack head. Some other stuff I can’t remember and should mention.    Professional Ability: Good enough and Getting better. I would be equal in skill to most artists who make their living. I just realized that I was working with a dinosaur of a computer and pulling of the shit I did was with crap for tools.  Example: My recent work… not bad for 128 sd ram  Evaluation: Fuck… I’m a dnd rogue….  But honestly… if there were any magic… I’d be a bard and not a nice bard… a kick ass orc horde leading bard. I would run an army with my skills.   DND Stats (NPC CLASS: Aristocrat 2nd level) 	Current	Potential 	Ideal 	Score		Score (25)	Score (32) STR	10		13		14 DEX	11		12		14 CON	10		12		10 INT	11		12		14	 WIS	10		10		14	 CHA	11		13		14  VALENTINES DAY  I went to virra mall 3x just to get my computer fixed. It would have been easier if the guy in my mom’s MIS gave me an honest account of whats wrong with the computer. Now I have it running 8x faster than before. At 512 ddr ram shes running smoothly and helping me fine.   I can take the ram to the states. That’s 4300 worth of ram so I hope it fits in  job’s computer so we can all benefit. If possible I’ll bring the whole CP there too that way I don’t have to spend 1000 dollars for a whole new computer for my work.

      I am done with my project… I just have to go to Creative Café and put them together and print them out. WHY in Creative!!! Its cause my computer is 125 ram that’s why!!! I need speed babe’ dara’dara! Anyways when I print out the poster and cards… I have to check and see how big I can afford  2ft by 3ft would 6square feet and P90 per square feet would cost me cost me 540pesos!!! Ouch! Not to mention the cards… 8 prints of 100 pesos each!!! That’s already 1300!!! Good thing mom gave me another 1k + 500 I have left from my allowance!!! Oh yeah 200 pesos for the book binding!!! Fuck I’m broke!!!  After printing it all out I will have to finish my documentation. Which should not be so hard anymore since I have a survey to prove it. Enough time to game and submit it after which I’m celebrating broke!!!   I made some great art!!! I’m in the zone unfortunately I have to do non-art stuff ASAP!!!  I might get a 0.0 this midterm grade… nothing I can’t make a 1.0 by the end of the term.  Faith in my abilities as well as having the support of mom and dad made this success possible…. In the book itself I’ll dedicate it to them. The booklet is just there for purposes of presentation… the book will be of much better quality… since I will take my 1 month before returning to the states working on it!  The most difficult thing about the setting is telling people about it. I guess when your doing an RPG about the Philippines people can’t imagine what would make it interesting. I love the fact that if you study hard enough you’ll find the most interesting things about what you are trying to love.  Discovering that the Philippines was a bastard child of Spain and these untamed isles is something people forget to take pride in. They do not realize that we are Filipinos because of the circumstance of our creation not by some holy shit or destiny. Solomon was the love child of King David… and he was the greatest king of the nation of Israel. We can all begin from a bad seed… but we learn that we still have a choice to improve ourselves or let things go on the way they are.   The most beautiful of flowers are those that thrive in adversity.   We may not look beautiful with the abuse of the friars and principalia, the tyrant marcos and the fiends he has put into power till this day, we may not be considered truly Asians because of our Polynesian appearance and westernized culture but here on to the future we make our own destiny or fate (if you call it).  When I say that : “It is an unexplored genre set in an obscure land far in the east. It is a game concerning the battle of good versus evil, amidst an era of reason and technology that so desperately hangs on to it’s mystical past.  Adventures set in a land creating it’s own identity while suffering under the sword of it’s oppressors and orphaned from its heritage.”  Orphaned when the friars burned what literature we had and killed and disgraced our holy people… like what they did to the south Americans: Aztecs, Mayans, Incas and other forever lost civilizations.   Oh well… that’s why the future is how we make ourselves into…  I don’t like pop-culture in general… Simply cause it is the idea that something cool has to be easy enough for everyone to learn and understand!   That is something taught to us in advertising… dazzle the bewildered masses into spending, tell them what they need!   I like finding something to provoke thought and curiosity. Maybe that’s why I don’t buy into the commercial crap… the only thing they do to me is understand how twisted it makes people inside. Growing up with American TV can screw with you… good thing in my days… educational shows are more interesting than the noontime shows that give the wrong kind of hope to the masses.   When my game comes out as well as the stories and adventures I will write it is a chance for the youth to discover what it means to be a Filipino in this day and age. Ironically I wont be one by the time I will make it big! Why not… Why should I recognize a corrupted government which cannot improve the welfare of its people.  We are not the mindless masses the conspiring modern day villains intentionally kept ignorant. Many have given their blood for this nation to have it’s chance at a life that is not tied up by the machinations of the selfish and wasteful.   FOOD I love mustard… to bad not a lot of Filipinos discovered it!  I’m sure bicolanos would like it given the chance (a region known for their equal to thai or Indian taste for spices) to taste it.  I had burger machine… but I find myself craving to spend P300 in national sports grill for their bottom less fries and 1lb worth of servings of meat.   My glasses came apart a while a go… I had to screw it back on with a parking card… whoa what a feat.   I’m in the zone but work has my hands tied… I need to work for a gaming company!!! If there is anyone out there I’m just looking for a $20 dollars an hour art job!!! Just enough for me to work 6 hours a day 6 days a week. Well I’ll send my portfolio to Gaming companies if they want someone like me to work for them even if its freelance with the same rates as gurps B&W whole page $150+ I could do a lot of work… tireless just to get money for my bros and save up for an apartment… The cool thing is I’m a Filipino I eat leftovers, I have a healthy diet, martial arts exercise + soccer and brothers to take care of onlything that can go wrong is someone killing me… which unusually has a better chance happing in the states.. the country with the largest deaths from guns rate. Thank you Michael Moore :P

      I’m here in school for a test. I just hope that it was as easy as the exercise my prof gave. I’m almost done, I guess I have to just retract my statement that it was meant for a foreign market and say there is enough interest generated by the gaming community to have a book published about it.  I just wish I could have held a bigger survey. But looking into problems to come, I have to edit some more of the work again just to improve on the quality. Thank god dad allowed for the 5,000 peso upgrade ($100). The 125 mb more of ram would help me work for sure. Too bad connecting to the internet really slows me down, I wish I can stay on so that if ever I need pics to manipulate I have it on easy access.   I haven’t been able to write here often given my work. I haven’t even been able to answer calls or call people as well. I don’t want to think of anything else but work cause there is a lot to do.  BUT I will finish a head of schedule. If I can get the ram chips by today or tomorrow I will get ahead of schedule.  Today I will finish the cards and the booklet… If I finish them before 3 I can send them to the printers. I have a project due on Wednesday. Which I can delay since I heard Midterms is next week.  I have to meet nico tonight at around somewhere.   I have to ask him for more art. I’m planning a line of gothic posters for my project. Magic and Gore, would be the theme mostly with a dash of the colonial air of rural Philippines.   I made a good poster in my opinion. Good since I didn’t see so much of the editing, just some line on the candle that can be mistaken for their glow. I haven’t made a project this good in a computer as crappy as mine. I bet I can work a miracle with a 10,000 peso ($200) upgrade to 480mb ram.   I have no games and windows xp is a miracle worker since I don’t need adaptors for the  web cam, video converter, and other stuff I will be attaching.  The amount of stuff I have to do even after this seems indomidable. But with only 3 classes and work on the side I can pull it off.    Games  I learned that nothing pumps blood into my veins more than an action pact game. Player or GM the thrill is so good, I guess I could give up masturbation if I could get that kind of hit every day. I just realized how much gaming is important to me, how the rush sustains me and gives me hope through the week.   It is now more than ever do I realize that gaming is one of the most important parts of my life. Leaving puberty behind, sex isn’t great in fact sex is more worry than I could afford. It is deceptive how people praise it so much or how much they need it. But in the reality I’d rather play soccer, run or play in a game, and just hang out drinking with my friends.   So with the lack of sexual need I have become a geek or maybe a abstained adult. Not exactly how I saw myself becoming when my social skills improved. To bad ass is to much worry than its worth. Even if I go to the states, given the more liberal concept around it, I don’t think I can just do it with out worry of HIV, sensation less condom, or being comfortable enough to execute a smooth move.   RJ  It is interesting to listen to RJ’s problem. The man that’s got it all made. His first girlfriend was a model, who he dumped cause he thought he was not ready for commitment (while in puberty that is amazing). He survived a fatal accident where he almost became crippled for life, he is finishing becoming a doctor, and he lost 40 lbs in the course of a year to soccer and an improved lifestyle change.   A bank account that would make most guys want to kill him,  A good sense of style and a really pleasant demeanor. He is your nice guy who is both thoughtful and with a subdued charm.   Although he has problems… and his problem is much more complicated than the average joe we have here. His biggest problem is that he enjoys the memory of Marga Tuazon… yeah that’s his first love and he enjoys being single, he also enjoys taking his sweet time getting to where he’s going. WHY IS THIS A PROBLEM? Its because everyone else (but his friends and loved ones) think that he shouldn’t have lost that much weight so fast, that he should settle down since everyone else have a gf, or his general concern of how marga’s doing.   Ok people who read this might know my stand when it comes to others peoples opinions… who gives a fuck… and RJ is feeling pressure that his life is too perfect. I guess what I failed to tell him that night was that a general public given how they vote and where their priorities lie would not be a good standard to tell him how he’s doing.     New combos 1- True strike has no somatic components, So does Light and Flare. These make a not bad combat wizard. A 9th level elven wizard can spend 5th level slots to quicken true strike… it would only be worth while if the character has a huge amount of damage deliverable via arrow.  It better to use it with combo telekenisis… where the character can whirl a ton of damage with no chance of failure except for a fumble.  2- Intelligent 6+ special mount or familiar can be trained or exercised to aid you or aid them.    3- Share spell ability in special mount or familiar allows enlarge person to target even the companion since it ignores target type! Combo would be, a paladin with his special mount- imbued by a cleric of strength enlarge! That would allow the paladin to enlarge himself and his mount!!! Now that’s a combo! A dire wolf of huge and a Paladin of large.  4- unseen servant protects a wizard by dropping caltrops and picking them up. It can hold 9 spaces worth of caltrops (18lbs). Standard action- pickup, Move action- move, and free action drop. On a 3x3 square area. Caltrops stops  creatures mid charge and the useen servant can be commanded as a free action.

      It has been more than a week since I last updated. I am so busy with my thesis all I do is eat sleep and work… of course being me there is TV to kill the pattern of work and panic. I don’t know what more I can say but that I seem to be able to make the schedule.   My mom got my card and I got a D for Deferred I just hope to make it a 1.0 by the time I’m done. I got no grade lower than a 3 in the last scores which kicks but… but I couldn’t care less. If those were ones and I’m done with thesis I would do almost anything in my power to celebrate the shit out of me.   Anyhow, Nico was a big help. With his contribution I can certainly make possible what is impossible. I hope I can finish everything on Monday so that I can just collect the surveys and retype my shitty documentation and submit it to my prof.  I can’t believe I worked this much on a subject… I mean, every other subject I got by ok and still was able to hold a game. This shit starved me of what made my existence possible: a good game.   Oh yeah it was  great game last Thursday. Although it was my fault I did not know that there was rule about having mounts which had higher CR than me. It was ok, cause I liked horses and Magnus being a beautiful heavy warhorse was still cool.  We had two encounters… One was 8 orcs where  went down the first round BUT not before I dazzled them with hypnotism. They all were indifferent and went on their way, but Henry started attacking them. I only stopped 6 out of the 8, on of the two hit me with a critical 16! Thankfully Benj wasn’t using the orcs I made for him to use on us or I would have been dead. The average damage of those orcs against us were 9, the one I made had an average damage of 12. On a critical hit those things would only do 18, mine would make a 36 so I was very happy he didn’t.   The second encounter was a breeze, I earned my keep a second time with a color spray which blinded all attacking Gnolls but their pet Hyena. Which Jy put to sleep. 480xp for the whole session, which I liked and a lot of opportunity to make money by hypnotizing anyone hapless enough to get in my way and carry money.   If there was a way I’d post my stats here for posterity and the kick as portrait I made for him.   Even talking about how well the game went last meeting gives me a recharge. Well, back to work.

      What I have finished: Main character 80% : just finishing touches in pencil and computer Sam: face done ( I consider faces 40%) Mey: most of the face done ( I consider faces 30%) Dam: most of the face done ( I consider faces 30%) Nik: most of the face done ( I consider faces 30%) Tadeo and Tiras: most of the face done ( I consider faces 30%)  So that has been pretty good. Now I will need studies of  clothing to get the folds right and not make it to made up. Also address some character looks trying to make them unique despite they are wearing everyday clothes. The amount of drawing I will certainly be getting ready to draw 2 pages a day.    To Mel:  GET LAID MAN!!! get a skank so there is less guilt, nice girls are for love making he he :D anyway don't feel so uncomfortable about it.  A key skill guys need to learn is how to get laid. I know a lot of the guys here don't know how... but there are circles that are as promiscuous as more liberal cultures. I know how already but I don't have a job and means to impress...   if Em sets you up go with it cause you know you can certainly use the exp. If there is no other excuse but exp. that is great but better is knowing how it is to get laid. As soon as a friend of mine started a fling his hormones kicked in and he learned a bit about priorities cause getting laid is hard and worth it.   In the states they are more casual with sex... unlike here... a girl who is casual with her bed space is considered a slut... they forget how much of a blessing it is for deprived men and empowering for a woman to not depend on one guy when there are many guys who suck at relationships.   Anyway, when you get to my age and have hindsight of getting laid you won’t be too crazy about it. I am “over the hill” sexually and I’m not afraid to admit it. I don’t plan to marry or have kids of my own… or get a GF… so its ok for me. When I was your age, my blood rushes to my head like a train crash and my heart pumps like it will explode, when a pretty little thing walks past I get dizzy, but at my age failing and meeting enough bad choices got me to cool down.   SO GET LAID AND ADD THAT TO THE LIST OF THINGS  YOU DID THE FIRST TIME. And later on its better to get a fuck buddy.

      Its hard to work. I find myself looking for something that isn’t there. Mom interups me and I have to do an errand ruining the moment I have the momentum. I wish I could scream, I could complain but what point will it be. She expects an artist to work with interruptions… she doensnt know what world she is living in.   When people are working pretty hard one can guess that they have a lot of things on their mind and a lot of concentration. My ability to concentrate improved at this age compared to what it was before I assessed my self. I was curious to what can cause my lack of inspiration… and I realized the lack of fun I have in my situation.   I keep thinking things will be fun again when I’m with my brothers and our friends are with us too. I keep overlooking that there is a long way to go before I can have that fun. Right now I have to draw my first comic.   I get really pissed, violently pissed when mom ruins it and I can’t say anything. The notion in our family is “shut up if you don’t have a job!” that is wrong and I hope when I’m supporting my brothers I won’t be like that. Its hard, I was thinking if I was a simpler person I would produce simpler art and works that are not as sophisticated… but as a more complicated/fickle person I have more needs and more wants to get me where I’m going.   It I rely on simple satisfactions I won’t grow… I need the games, I need GMs as complicated and capable as the standard Bobby Navarro, (I keep forgetting his name… Pat’s friends who works in Phil Airlines and ran delta green) ,Jobert and Myself.   SHIT!!! NOW MOM IS ASKING ME TO DOWNLOAD THE PICTURES, RECHARGE THE BATTERIES AND CANDY IS ASKING ME TO GET OUT OF THE ROOM WHILE I’M MAKING THIS!!! SEE HOW FUCKED UP HOME IS!!!

      One drawing. Just one Run of the mill drawing… I must find a catharsis and fast. I don’t get any creative inspiration. I’ve been reading starman and in terms of story its great, layout its great, but art… well it good plus but not the bomb. I need to study more but I don’t have time. I learned early one that finishing means accepting some mistakes and getting better as I go. But It takes a while to understand some mistakes. Especially here at home.. where its just too bland to help me creatively.   I guess my standard of art would be a Warhammer art by Adrian Smith(did I get that right). Now that’s wow art. As an illustrator he is great but I learned that its harder to be a comic artist. Especially being an artist doing comics. Its hard with the 2 pages a day but with computer games a sleeping habits I can get inspired. Too bad I don’t have warhammer stuff and enough gothic adventures to get me in the mood.  I haven’t had a GM that got me so riled up since Bobby Navaro with his warhammer game. DAMN, it takes energy… but running one generates energy as well. I want to run GURPS 4th ed when I go to the states. Screw D20… I’m a gurps guy eversince I saw the book back in 1997 in the states. I bought it and tough as nails… learned it. It was hard from a DND point of view and the fact that it was a book with a college reading level. But I learned enough to have fun. I have to say it is still the hardest game to cheese. Which makes it the best game for me. White wolf is too easy cause everyone is too lax with the rules… you pay for the rules right… if I don’t then what stops my player or my gm from screwing with me?!? Yeah that’s the good aspect of a rules lawyer… and pushing the GM to work harder and allowing him to perfect his craft.   Anyhow… just trying to relax… I just made the outlines of the next lets say 8 drawings I’m going to try to make today. Hopefully I recover. I want inspiration… where the fuck am I going to find it.   DREAM   Had a dream I had a GF… whoa long time ago kind of thing… must be from reading starman. Anyways… we have a kid and I’m happily ever after and all. Except that I’m dying which isn’t so bad… so I work the shit of me and try to find a way to make a ton of money out of it. In the end I’m fading and my GF (not wife) and son have no mortgage to worry off and enough money for a start at college. Not bad…too bad my kid won’t grow up to be a gamer.. In the dream I died when he was four or something… to young to learn to game. That would suck…

      HOW IS MY LIFE? well its ok... mom doesn’t know it that the computer scam thing was so bad. I just failed my term cause of all the work it took. I want to blow up the store so badly for what they did to my computer and no will take my word at home except my friends. I just want to leave this country cause there are no consumer protection laws.   No one in the school will believe what happened to me and consider it my fault for not backing up... but selling faulty computer parts is direct sabotage... what can i do. I want to pick my self up and move on but no one will believe me and let me go on with out a sermon to push me farther down into depression.   These are the times I am not afraid to die. That living is so much more painful than it should be. That even when I am down on my luck and picking up the pieces my parents see me as a failure no matter what I do.   I just want to run away sometimes. Maybe forget everything about who I was and start from scratch. I did that when I left for UP and Left for Benilde. So I did it twice already… and I am ready to do that again. Its just that I am not a quitter… it just my parents blow out of proportion what bad things happen to me.  I get up despite being wounded, despite being hurt badly and crippled and play on. The way I play soccer. And yet my parents love to put me down saying it is all such a waste. I’m going to draw and going to do good in that seminar… Gino and I will be discovered and we will not have to endure this shit anymore.  I just want a small apartment. Something I can afford with my brothers. I don’t want a house cause I don’t want to see my parents or ask help from them till I make my name. Its hard that I try to become independent stumble, and they get pissed at me. I can pick up the pieces and go on. I can shrug the pain and keep going. EVEN IF I DID FAIL, it’s not the end of the world. I see beauty in imperfection and beauty of growing up despite difficulty.  My parents do to but they do not see that I don’t need this safety harness they have on me. They forget that all I want is to sink or swim. It’s the best end for me, If I die by my own weakness the world is a better place and I don’t have to worry anymore the way my mom taught me how to worry my life away.   I just want to live. Make some comics, some books and be happy with out having to be successful. Anyway If I was meant to be successful then I would not have had this kind of life. The most kick ass people in this world don’t even care about the most important things.   I think about The most powerful people who are the most kind and insightful… they don’t care about the rest of the world. If they think that most of the resources of the world is needed to make them happy… and sharing it will not then I guess we never left the dark ages.     A friend said that dying for a cause was selfish. That death was an easy way out.   You can’t say that to me… because living in complacency is much worse… like a cancer that slowly eats at one’s soul. It is so much better to die for a cause… even if it was the simple cause of living one’s own life despite how imperfect and stupid he may be.   PERCEPTIONS  I always prayed that I loose my… well those who knew me in my early college days know how much I lived for sex. I woke up everyday to sex morning and evening. I bragged about it, and craved for it despite getting some everyday… I kept praying that god neuter my mind.   And he did. I got what I prayed for…   Now I pray for that my parents understand and let me suffer my own mistakes and let me go out of the world with no lecture and no sermon. I am a good person… just don’t ruin it for me. America, the land of opportunity. I am as good as a lot of other artists out there. I have also suffered as much as the really good ones and I have a unique perspective to give for the world at large.   I hate my country. I love the Idea, the History and the heroes. They were great men and women.. but the generation  after them had no balls. No one will kick the ass of these mud-slinging hypocrites and seize the power to change and turn this power around.  FPJ would only be the best candidate if he were the puppet of a greater power not ACTOR/POLITICIANS who will use him to pay the bill.   So far I have not seen any proof that Arnis is as good as it claims as an art of swordsmanship. All evidence of 2-weapon fighting began only when the Spanish arrived. I need to see clearer proof other than just claims. The only other swordsmen I know that can kick ass are the Vikings and the Japanese. Fighting without armor but with weapons that can penetrate armor puts them in the highest mark in my opinion of swordsmanship.   Vikings despite not being organized were a free people and spirit. They’re warrior culture allowed them to developed steel blades before some swordwielding culture of today ever knew of bronze.   Anyway I will going back to drawing.

      I read an article: The Influence of Spanish Renaissance Swordsmanship on Filipino Martial Arts?  by John Clements found in http://www.thearma.org/essays/influence.htm. I want to tell everyone how true this is. I am a Filipino and also an exponent practitioner of Kali as I studied the moves and compared them to other martial arts and studied the martial history of the Philippines through the design of our weapons it proves so true that our martial art was not as good as Myth makes us believe. Sad but true. Our blades were imbalanced, they were simple iron and they did not have the refined craftsmanship found in countries who have been making swords since the founding of iron.   The bagani though still kicked allot of ass. Being Muslim, they had education and the smithing arts of middle east with them… with their culture mixed no wonder they were masterful swordsmen of the era. They were the ones who were able to keep up with European martial culture… coupled with their bloody profession and quota (they had to kill pretty often… and fight larger numbers by themselves) they got better than the rest of the warriors of the islands. Unfortunately their skills died with them. Their was no method of passing on the prowess without killing the previous holder.    But Filipinos should not be distressed by this. Pride is much a sin as a virtue. Especially false pride. As a colonized people and those who have lived in exceptional hardship even up to these times, the ability of the Filipinos lies in their ability to adapt and survive. Adaptation may have skewed our perspective and our minds given such terribly corrupt, immoral, uneducated and decadent times but it has helped us survive till this day.   We have already come to a point that we should start thinking more than adapting. Time has change and the next evolution of our cultural survival is the strengthening of our culture’s positive traits and playing down the negative ones.   Understanding Western martial arts have helped me understand Arnis better… and improve on the techniques of my ancestors. What better way to make them proud.

      Wow! We finally did it. We started the project. It all began Sunday night. Gino and I were thinking I better start working and put it all on paper. And we finally put the outline down. Everything begins with one BIG first step. And it was just a cool first step. With the outline done in 12 issues 24 pages each 288 page graphic novel about the Philippines.   I’m busy so if anybody is looking for me I’m hitting the drawing pad and making the comic. I can’t say anything else till we’re done and we would love to celebrate this REBIRTH of cultural realization.

      Wednesday We played falling and it was fun. I have never been so excited for the duration of these hectic projects. Arj, Ricky, Rick, Vicente, Carl and Nico were all there. I played my Ron Stoppable character in the Dragon Blood Game and had a good laugh really playing Ron. We had so much fun and we got some work done when I brought the laptop and Showed off my Projects. They Liked the poster and were impressed. Arj said he would invest in me if I were to make it a comic or a game book. I’m very happy with their creative constructive criticism and their enthusiasm of making their own comic book or success.   And I’m saying this as a Professional: That Rick and Nico can make a ass kicking comic whose quality will blow so much of the new comics assess out of the water. Rick is a Planka winner. Nico is basically much like me but with a better talent in drawing. I wish I can help them so that they can avoid the pitfalls of comic story telling and creation.   Thursday I came from intramuros and Diamond Web Computer Services. That was manila to santolan.  Left at 10:45 and arrived at Henry’s at 2:45. So that was 4 hours on the road. I should wake up earlier, but sleep was so important to me since inspiration is scarce.    I bought the mouse and began fixing stuff. Its hard when most of my material got washed away with my original PC and I have to work with scratch. I used to have so many downloads of images to call from not to mention my previous computer had internet access to take advantage of.   Played 1 hour of Deus Ex at Realistic Difficulty. It was Cool and I kicked so much ass my toe hurt. In  a game where the Gamed Designers are GMs after my own heart (by making everything doable with enough ingenuity) each time is a successful mission objective.   Friday I completely forgot to accompany Gino to bring Cathy and Tweet home. Hmmm… It slipped my mind and it just came to me when I continued drawing on the project. I was thinking of finishing the drawing because I was so disappointed not getting Joaquin Phoenix’s face just right. I will print out several pictures of him and start drawing him at different angles.   Today we impressed even ourselves. We decided that a comic that needed to be said in 5 pages isn’t a comic worthwhile to go on for a long series. A comic of that quality should be introduced in 24 pages. We should not forget the basics and fundamentals of a good story and of course never underestimating the mind of the readers. With that we will begin work as soon as possible.   I for one will try to make a lot of art about Jerico our main character. This work is for my portfolio and the comic seminar. If we get discovered, I just hope we are.

      I’ll be leaving in a short while to go to Vicente’s place for a game and to talk to the guys about the coming game I will be running. I am relaxed and taking my time. I don’t want to stress myself and panic like before. I can work longer and better hours now that I have the company notebook. Its really cool. That is what money can buy, 2.3GH chip, 512ram, and 50 gigs for me to use. Unfortunately there is one huge drawback… No mouse! As an artist I can not draw on the touch screen and the pain and frustration of learning to use it is unbearable.  Diamond Dream Chum saves my day again by selling the cheapest usb mouse in all the retail stores in manila (except their franchises of course) at 280!!! All the others cost 900+ to 4,000+. They saved my ass once again… unfortunately a mouse like that must be in demand. It was out of stock but they are letting me order it and get it tomorrow at 1.  I ate out with Jo, Niki, Helen and Candice Que(I pronounced it “Q”) today. It is the first time I just went up to some people and asked if they want to go out instead of being unsociable in the time everyone was having lunch. Again most of the time spent with Candice was a verbal exchange about how I’m a spoiled rich son-of-the-boss and her being such a tomboy. That was relaxing. Too bad she has a boyfriend already but that is a good excuse or my dad would have not stopped making me ask her out or work for her.   Anyway… a laptop is cool cause I can find a nice quiet place anywhere to work and get things done when traffic, locale or plain inconvenience would stop me. I wish mom and dad spent that $1000 on me or $30,000 on a slightly weaker but just as useful model. I could have been using one for a year. Enough time to make money and fix all these things I have planned for the states.   TUESDAY  I was really pissed at candy since she would rather surf for manga than let me use her computer. I always let her use the computer when it was my custody and if it was important let her use it ahead of me. She has no memory or gratitude. For that I won’t help her except financially support her. This is the third straw and I can’t be that forgiving to someone who should be acting like an adult by now.   Heck I stopped talking to her since yesterday.

      This is report i am filing against the guys who broke my computer and owe me P8,450 in refund + a new 20gig harddisk + my projects and damages   It was A Thursday February 21  It began when I bought one 256 DDR ram from @ Gear. They sold me ram telling me that it will be compatible with any computer. The sales lady said that ram just needs to be placed on the computer and then it is all done.   I knew about the two kinds of ram but the company told me I was using DDR ram since I was using a Pentium 4. So I went home to install the new ram chip I bought for P2,150. To my surprise It did not install. I went back and asked about why it does not fit. The Technician Jo said that my ram was SD. An older model physically incompatible with the one I bought. So I wondered about the prices. I have money saved up and from my parents to as much as P6,800 pesos with me and I was really wanted a faster computer to work with projects.   So on my third trip there to virra mall I brought my computer and they offered to refund the Ram I bought. I was already there with my computer and I thought I must well have an upgrade if it fits my budget. So I asked them if there is a mother board I can afford. The Lady told me she will sell me a Redfox for P2,150. I asked about any compatibility problems, she said it was a good product.  I spent P6,450 as each piece cost 2,150 pesos. The 2 ram chips and the Redfox mother board.  When they installed the motherboard and the ram it did not work. The computer failed to recognize the new motherboard. This was the statement of the Technician. So I went home and followed his instructions and copied my back-up from a friend’s computer.  I installed the Reformatted and Installed the OS then the computer began to work. For only three days. The computer kept hanging while I worked on my projects.    Then I returned on February 26 to let them install it themselves and see what is wrong. They replaced every part but the motherboard and the computer still hung. They then proceeded to tell me it is the OS’s fault.   I went back to them on  March 4 without my computer asking them to help me exchange this ram which may be defective. They told me to comeback with a receipt. This was my fifth trip to these people. I then proceeded to use my computer despite it’s faulty operation. I did not have enough money to get it fixed anymore. Not until the March 8 Monday did the computer finally crash and ruined all my projects. I could not save any back up files since it would hang while would try to copy them.   The computer hanging have gotten so bad that the hard drive broke. I returned with a friend who was a specialist with computers on March 10 Wednesday. They told me the hardrive was broken. They said it was the hard drive’s fault but the hard drive was working the prior to the faulty operation which occurred only when they gave me the motherboard. I did not like their motherboard and asked if I can return it and exchange it for a new one. They told me it had been two weeks and the value has dropped. A new motherboard with better specifications would cost +2000 pesos. I agreed and proceeded to use the new motherboard which they assembled in their office. After repairing the old hard-drive which was somehow salvaged by my friend I proceeded to test the computer which was now working. That very day it ran fine. The next day the computer blacked out.   We returned the computer on March 15 Monday. They told us it was the power supply’s fault but when the power supply was working they had to rule that out. My Intell Pentium 4 chip has ceased working as well as my hard drive. They told me it’s my chip that caused the black out. I told them to replace my chip because I know that everything was working fine until they touched it. Now I lost my project files, my intell Pentium 4 chip. They broke my P4 chip, my files and my hard drive and refused to give a refund because of their policies.       Computer Scams. If you are afraid to buy a new computer this is why.   First, they will sell you a faulty cheap motherboard. This motherboard is usually the Red Fox brand, which closed 2 years ago. Where do they get it: they are fakes and returned damaged boards.  Second, you will return complaining that the new board isn’t working well. They will replace it with another faulty board. If you return again then they will tell you that they can give you a better board for +2000 to +1000 the old board. This board is much better in specification but is mostly defective. You will be paying +2,000 the board’s actual price  Third, you will return the new board and then they will replace it again or give you the choice of upgrading to a better board. This board is even cheaper than the second board you bought. It is a working board but they will charge you +500 for it. While it actually costs –2500 of the previous board.   Last, if you catch on they will deny refund and blame your computer for it. Do not be a victim, If you are tell your friends and family and spread the word. No one should be a victim.   The Computer places that use these scams are:  MICROTEQ PC SOLUTIONS CO. 1-2 Acacia Lane 2/f Virramall, Greenhills. @ GEAR DISCOUNT COMPUTER   Not All stores will try to Scam you. Unusually most Filipino Run stores have this practice and this is their modus operandi. Computer Stores.   Copy and Paste this around for the protection of your friends and family from computer scams.

      Laguna was beautiful… I didn’t know how beautiful it was cause Patrick doesn’t like expounding in those kinds of details. OR it was just me not paying attention.   I have to say that when I was going there the land became much more… pretty. I mean there was this open expanse and a lone kilometer long road going there as the building sat in an open plain by itself. Behind it hills which watched over the wide valley that speaks with her gentle yet strong winds. It was a new building with  a modern architectural design. Nothing to stop my view of the unending horizon.   And it was 25 km from tagaytay.  We ate in this place called Lindsey and had hot coco in bag of beans. Lindsey had a stunning view of the lake where I can make out 3 villages from and shallow beaches of the lake. Bag of beans smelled of flowers as me patric and trish wandered it garden labyrinth. WHOA… talk about having a better day.   I’m going there again. I can just keep going on about how beautiful and romantic the places I just visited yesterday. It was something that with all the hustle and bustle here in manila forgets.   There was a deep stream that ran by the school and in it’s quiet solitude you can lose your self in thought and imagination.   Anybody who wants to join me for another trip Comment or text me. I’m planning another trip there this Friday and with patrick’s permission have a relaxing day in tagaytay far from the worries and problems here in manila.

      Shit happens…   It is strange how it all happened. When I came back from the office I find out that the fuse I gave them blew and the motherboard is not responding. I was about to have a breakdown till Tim told me it is still salvageable. That the motherboard can still be saved but the power supply must be replaced.  I’m go to go to Laguna to see Patrick. I haven’t seen him in a while and this is a good opportunity. Trisha is coming with me so I have kasama… I know henry can’t go cause of class i wanted the more the merrier... being how i like crowds of freinds.   After that I will scrape some money to buy a power supply and learn to install it. I hope I can get all the materials together by the end of that long afternoon. Majed seems too busy to play which is ok by me. Its less work in my overworked week.  MAGIC…  I knew it was going to happen. I know I won’t graduate despite how hard I tried. And I gave it all. I went through people who used me and milked me for money I did not own to improve my performance in school by getting a computer that I don’t need to leave to render or save a file. Its just sad my parents won’t ever believe how hard I tried and school won’t reflect my abilities as it was designed to and how hard I tried to follow that design.   But my dad doesn’t believe in luck or bad luck… its just that I feel something really good will happen… something like an incredibly lucky that will make this all turn around and the bad things that happen are just there to make it so much sweeter.  I rolled a ten when I called it. Like a wish a small insignificant wish. I think me and gino will be discovered on the seminar. Someone will say they need us and will be letting us have a chance to publish as we get our act together.   Someone will go up to us and hand us the brass ring and make all the fears of our parents (not our fears) go away. He will give it to us like an angel from heaven. We will toil and sweat and be sleepless to make a work of God. And all this pain, this misery will disappear.   I feel it in my bones… and Gino I’m sure knows it will happen soon. This year will be the year when our patience will be rewarded.   The die roll was an omen… and this is my prayer

      Its Friday today…  Ive noticed I’m soo stressed that I don’t spell anymore…  Well lets sum Thursday all up… Picked up Tim while coming from school where my teacher lectured for only 20mins then disappeared… (I love that) Was fighting every urge to go eat at tita su.   We went to virra mall and arrived there at around 4:00 and bought a new mother board selling the old one. I was offered to sell my asus mother board at a cost of 2500.   We went back home…  zeroed my hardrive, partitioned and formatted. Installed OS and Viola!!! It works… Thanks tim… again.   We talked about old games until the basic stuff was installed and  I brought him home.   Tim like helping people with their computer problems as I like teaching people skills that I like to share. Cool.  Gino dropped by at around 8 then we steamed. We talked about the comic book and tried to get all the elements we want down. I was invited by gino to go join a seminar with him where we might get discovered… far fetched for me but like that Camile Velasco I should be open to the possibility and not put my hopes up.    Slept and woke up late on firday… where me and gino left to register.. I knew I was going to make a mistake writing down my own name… it happens in days like these.   I came back to a computer that just went pop! The fuse broke. I had to ask tim what it was all about. So I went to the office to get it fixed and going to glorieta to buy the fuse and fuse holder…  What a life…  I’m now 5 weeks delayed with 3 projects… thanks to my computer… Something doesn’t want me to graduate and I am trying to comprehend what. Maybe in the states that would be used against me in the future… somehow    Oh yeah have you ever tried the fish egg pasta that is so creamy... my mom made some so i'm really into eating at home for today.

      Ok I slept 3:30am and woke up at 6 am to go to lola’s birthday. I then went, I ate fried chicken, little rice and the meatloaf with this really tasty sauce.   Then I left commuting and closed my eyes in a restful daze in the trip to virra mall from M. Domingo Street near where I used to live. I arrived and walked to mc donald’s to eat a small piece of pancake. I waited for nico and when he arrived we proceeded to virra mall proper to convert his tape.   It cost 400 pesos per disk and took 2 disks. At 2:30 I took a jeep then a bus to buendia and then a jeep.. walking home the rest of the way. I got home borrowed some money then proceeded to Tim’s house to pick him up. Then Virra Mall again… and the terrible rush hour traffic.  Paid an Additional 2000 making the total cost of the computer 8,000 + the five trips and 1500 spend on gas and extra expenses. Their Redfox shit broke my hard drive which tim helped me fix.    That shitty.   Now we went back to Tim’s place got  his PC tools and we went to my place to begin PC repairs. There was a long part about getting the second CD drive to work… I guess that’s one of the hitches of doing this kind of work.   Now I missed the game at Vicentes where I was supposed to introduce the Power point tables and modifications for my players so that they wouldn’t have a hard time with spell slots.   Now Its 10:50 and I can just sleep where I am sitting… in candy’s room. So I just have to clean up the computer stuff… sleep, wake up to a new day where I will try to go to school and fix crap I have no power over.  Not to mention I missed CSI (SHIT)…  Strangely Tim Recognizes Tita Su… is one of the people who loves the place and knows about it… that cool. I mean whoa…

      Why does these things happen to me…  One can call it a stroke of bad luck… but there shouldn’t be anything like luck.   Yesterday Gino, Cathy and Tim dropped by and helped me fix the computer. Tim taught me a lot about what was wrong and can go wrong with my computer. It was something I was absorbing as much as possible.   In the end my computer was working… I don’t know why nobody thought of adjusting the virtual memory thingy of the computer… I was no expert why didn’t the experts of my mom’s office and the place I bought it help out there.   Thanks Tim… BIG THANKS  In the end I had a game and a working computer. Deus Ex is a great game. It has all the elements of a well thought out and planned one. It had interactive elements and snippet information that would make a player wonder. It reminds me when I played Betreyal at Krondor… where there is always hidden stuff to find and you can always do something better than before. I just wish it had the same combat engine as halo… hell if it was merged as one game I would be stuck in the computer with  no thought of a life outside. Multi-player RPG with cybernetics as Rping… now that’s a game. Halo II has multiple gun “feats” so you can choose a style of character and cybernetic augmentation would certainly individualize characters and their strategies.   Anyhow… I played it from 6-2 in the morning. It was around 3 in the morning when I turned on the computer to read about my Pdfs and possible cheese when it hang for one final and catastrophic time. I don’t know why, but my luck isn’t that good these days.   I played computer to get my brain wired to work with new ideas and its gears crumbling with rust… now the computer hangs… and hangs in a different way from before. Shit. I don’t want to ask Tim to fix it so soon after he just did yesterday…   I tried looking at it myself taking to account Tim’s guidelines. His do’s and don’ts and still it doesn’t seem to want start working.   My luck is so bad… now that I have a game that isn’t “bitin” and I have accomplished allot and I don’t feel the need to game so much… I can focus on my work THIS SHIT KICKS IN!!!  My parents have given me 8,000 extra money to help me fix my computer… 6,450 for the upgrade, an extra 1,000 here and 500 there… What the fuck is wrong…    I don’t want to tell my parents that I failed because of luck. I am working on it. Doing things at the same time for other people and still being to meet some of the other deadlines I have. I just don’t get why my luck is so bad… I just hope it gets better… I can’t talk about this to mom and dad cause they will just start talking about y not doing it in the office…  They forget that this computer is the most powerful one they ever bought… and it is a P4, redfox, 32mb videocard (which is obsolte), 512mb ram, 19gig hd, Cd rom, Cd writer, and floppy drive is the best they already have…   It would be pointless for me to work in an office since most of my works are from scratch pieces I put together in my house. SHEEESH!  Oh well I finished my tale and I guess I better eat to keep my energy up.

      What is today like for me  Virra Mall… Crappy time in virra-mall, good thing I had company… namely Gino, Cathy and Antoinette. Ate Tofu beef something… I already forgot the name. Its mapo tofu I think. Something I should learn to cook before leaving for the states.   Good news is that Tim… Cathy’s brother is willing to have a looksee at my computer… and by the way he asks me about the problem and answers my questions he knows more about computers than any of the people who are supposed to be experts.   I really hope that he can fix it. I am really delayed with my projects and only my computer is powerful enough to do them.   Gino and I are going into comics… being a comic artist was my dream when I was grade 5. Now I am about to live it. The funny thing is I dreamed to become a game designer, a scientist-inventor, a writer and a hero. Will that ever happen?  I ate in Gino’s dad’s birthday today. We had stake so soft…that it could hold a shape. It  was a lot of great its.   I have come to a realization that all the world’s problem is summed up in poverty.. cause poverty sums up opportunity, welfare, work, education and quality of life. If we can ever solve poverty everybody will have the things above to make the world a better place.

      My computer is breaking down big time. I am using the school computer to check out my blog and update it. It is annoying cause the problem I guess with my computer is incompatibility. I think the people who sold me this computer has parts which is incompatible with mine.   Things that the guy checked with my computer…  Different Processor- still fucked up Different Hard-drive- same Different Motherboard… newer one- same result Different Video card- the same.. Different Ramchips- still hangs  Unusual Quirks… It is a memory problem… it keeps dumping “physical memory”… I don’t think it has anything to do with software so I leave it a hardware problem… which is more expensive.   It has a memory problem which I cannot figure out… I’m going to virramall to get it fixed… I just hope that It will get fixed or I can afford the repairs…   Gears… where I bought the parts have a P200 diagnostic and 350 repair… I hope other places have it as cheaper…  I only have 500 pesos left… I don’t know what I’m going to do if I have to replace hardware… I just wish for my computer to work the way it is supposed to work… which is 512 mb ram… and P4 intell chip.  Cost I want to avoid… New original software of 5,000 pesos… New Chip 5,000 pesos… New Motherboard +1,000 pesos… Change of Chips and stuff… 2,000 pesos or more  I don’t have money and all my work is one computer… there is nothing different about my computer except that it has a redfox motherboard and generic ram chips that doesn’t seem to work since I can’t feel the improved speed.  SCHOOL  Talked to Charles and John Acaba or is it Abaca… anyway gave them some more support in their stay as well as gave them my run of experiences in school. I was telling them my advice about funny things… like getting laid and not caring what people think… Nico was with us and commented how much I sound like an old man…  I feel it….  SLEEP  Alcohol is my sleep aid… I’m one of those people who have a deeper and more restful sleep from drinking alcohol. I  need it now so that I can sleep 8-6 hours a day… For the cost of a cervesa negra (P18) I can sleep well at night… cutting down my number of hours of rest 2-4 hours less.   Thank God for cervesa negra… I just hope I can find a substitute in the states… I hope wine cost cheep enough for me to drink regularly at night.    RPGS  I’m proud of my system creation but I can always use improvements. I’m asking rick to check it and tell me how he finds it. I hope its simplicity and design will make it a staple in gaming tables.   There is a game tomorrow and I will not miss it. I will be early as usual but that is because I will be coming from virra mall. I need a good game to get me going… My dependency on good games is a trait that I need to control and exploit as best as possible. Being a player it is easier for me to focus on work… but being a gm work has to be about the game…

      Problems…   The computer hanging is a problem… I spend 3 hours a day trying to fix it and wasting time when it hangs. I don’t know what to do. This never happened before and I have been putting Microsoft updates so that it would stop hanging.   Music  Candy just dragged me to the TV just to check out a song she found familiar. It was Beverly craven singing “Promise Me”. Strange being that I listened to all her songs and appreciate her mild jazzy style that focus on melody and a sad sad tone.   Work  I started making lists with this new memo pad a bought. “Things I can finish today” It is a realistic assessment of what I can do in the span of a day towards the goals I am trying to achieve. It also allows me to measure if I should indulge in my extra-curricular activities of sports at the cost of effort.   I realized that being an artist I work on inspiration. Games that are good give me drive… of course like all things you need a bigger hit the next dose. I noticed I’ve been trying to game more just to get that high. I need it, there is nothing I can do without a good game.   So inspiration can be quantified into a numerical pool of effort. Every time I do something it expends time and effort. If I want to get this project done… I must find enough sources of fun to kick me into gear and make it come out in my work.   Computer crashing as often as 10 times a day hinders that… I mean it by ten times a day. When I install a patch from windows it hangs… like it is stopping me from fixing the problems. It is annoying.   GAMES  Right now I’m playing a L5R Edo campaign set in the Tokugawa Period. I have to admit I wish my colleagues in gaming new how cool it would be to set one in our own Philippines history if they knew it as well as I did.   Gino is right… given my research and art… and his publication/business canny and writing we can put together a graphic novel about 1865… 300 years under the heel of the Principalia and the Tyrants. I hate the fact that no one else ever thought of researching for the cool stuff. They always had to “MARKET” the Philippines… THEY NEVER KNEW THAT THE ACTIONS OF THEIR OWN ANCESTORS WERE THAT TO BE PROUD ABOUT. In contrast of their situation… all our “real” heroes were great because it was never luck that made them who they were… they challenged the status quo and were killed by traitors… those who they also fought for… Like the Christian virtue of loving ones enemies.  SPEAKING OF CHRISTIANITY  What is mercy and what is justice. GOD IS ALL JUSTICE AND ALL MERCY!!! We had a conversation which started concerning Gino’s preferred school. It was between UP and CSB for an art course (FINE ARTS and MMA). I cited UP because in my experience in up you meet a greater range of people in UP… Terrible to saints. While in CSB and La Salle  you meet a smaller spectrum with very little extremes. I wanted UP simply because of the nice people who took me in despite my conjo English and naivite… there were people using me there and people who cared enough for me to watch my back even when I just considered them acquaintaces. In UP I found the extremes of the two spectrums.. and thought JA’s condition would best benefit from someone taking him under their wing. BUT Csb had less of the extremes and was a safer choice.   One thing Tipped the scales… The Teachers… UP had the same case for their Teachers… A woman… an old bitter hag failed my classmates (not me cause I got wise from her after learning from older batches of her unmerciful bias) despite the fact they went extra effort and spend double the number of hours in make up class just to pass!!! I hate her… she would spend the starting hours of the class saying how talentless we are and how anybody can draw or sculpt!!!   I know the reasons why she was like that… she was a failed artist. You can tell by her bragging of who she knew and the obvious effort she put in trying ton be as good as they were by saying she knew art… but alas… there was no justice.   I swear… I hate teachers like those… they give my teacher and professor friends a bad name.   Then came the idea of mercy… I know my brother tries hard in school but fails to wake up on time and just has a bad day. That happens to a lot of people going through teenhood. I myself went through that phase… now I’m on time, never slack off (yeah right) and I consider myself responsible.   Being youthfull is not something to be taken at fault. Being young and spending the night playing or carousing isn’t something bad… or worse a SIN!!!  It is a learning process, these are the times we learn that we are not invulnerable and that we have limits we must learn to negotiate.   A teacher of college knows this… that’s why I glad that a friend of mine has his hands in the youth’s pulse… knowing that some people just need a break. I’d rather be a lax teacher… but when it comes to grades… but when it comes to the students lives… I would like to ease the pain or help in the transition into adult hood.   It is far from me to judge the youth and fail her or him unless I know it would benefit her. Failure as a grade is not a punishment but a necessary action when I would think that taking this class would be a mistake for the youth… If someone is better of pursuing their interest and passing him or her here would just add dirt on the grave.   Teaching is complicated and I wouldn’t want to sound like someone who is trying to be an expert. I know experts… and that old hag is not one of them. I would be able to teach a class.. I’m not kidding when I say this… I can teach a class better English than her!!!

      Well came from a game just now. Checked my mail and have to find 3,000 pesos for other expenses before I leave.    GAME:  Ok for a 4th level sorcerer I should have gotten attack spells. I am willing to spend. 100xp and 500gp to rechoose my spells.  1st level- Lesser Sonic Orb, Burning hands, Shocking Grasp (familiar will deliver it)  I went toe to toe with a soap golem (dealing it 3dmg) with my dagger +1.   …that’s all     ATHLETICS  Going to a soccer game on Friday. Joff can’t go, I’ll ask Gino but I figure he is busy too. So I guess I’ll be the only one going to the game then. I hope there is enough people who play for a whole field game. I also hope ton x2 lends me his gloves for the game for me to play goalie. I’ve been getting better.   I’ll be working out right now. I’ll just do some drills with the ball. I hope that I can burn some calories and draw later. I feel guilty eating donuts in Benj's place.   I want to find some more art by Wayne Reynolds… that way I get a better idea of how I want to draw… he has more passion and life in his drawings than lockwood. And he isn’t afraid if it isn’t perfect.

       A DATE (my only date before I go)  What can I say? I’m leaving. I’m running a game on Saturday for majed and I am planning to make 1 more drawing tomorrow.   I had a date and we went out to national sports grill. I have to admit that I wanted to eat there cause it was cheaper and more filling than bubba gumps. I mean my date cost me less than a grand and spending that one just one meal would be outrageous.   Although bubba gump was my idea… I could not believe how expensive it is… I mean.. 700 for a plate… FUCK!!! Anyway I underestimated how filling a cup of Max Brenner’s hot Italian dark chocolate is. I couldn’t sleep after drinking it. What a buzz.  At least lola got to taste it. She loved it… but candy was so sad that she didn’t get it cause when lola got it… she thought it was all for her. Candy did not tell her that it was all that was left… THEN SHE ATE A SLICE OF SANSRIVAL!!! UNFORGIVABLE!!!  I’ve been candy’s dietitian and I have worked hard to make her lose weight and that terrible lack of self control pisses me of. I admit I have it at times… but I only need to be told to get by my will power.   Anyway thanks for going out with me. I mean… it means a lot. I planning to make that sacrifice allot of comic artists make for the sake of creativity that we talked about. Anyway I had a full life and as much sex as a married man in his first 9 months of bliss. I remember how a good kiss feels like (and how to do it).  I guess I set and packed (emotionally) to go to the states and stay in my apartment with my brothers and sister working on comics.    CONGRATUALTIONS!!!  To Paolo Rosero who will never read this Blog cause he is always to hammered for selling out his paintings in the exhibit he held one forgotten Wednesday evening.   I was the only from his past that went… Funny… I was his best friend in southridge too… (in sr not his whole life anyway). I guess you do things with/for the friends who matter.   I wish I could make the equivalent of his monetary killing. He has enough money to live off for 3 months. I wish I can do that… between me and paolo… I have to admit I’m the lesser artist.   Paolo can do three things better than me: Pain Drink and LOVE!!! I don’t know any other guy who falls in love so bad for a girl to the point of hammering some brain cells to oblivion then getting up then doing that same thing for another girl again and again.  I think and understand that If I had that life… I would be happy… and die happy. I admit to how insanely jealous and happy for paolo. DAMN!!! I wish my luck was as good.   BUT of course my situation is different and what would count as success given my circumstance is different.  Anyway its 4:30am and the horizon is looking brighter… I better sleep.       OoT: As a free lance working at home… doesn’t my electricity become a write off? Any how I wish there was a way for me to learn to do American Taxes.

      DND Rick made an unbelievable combo!!! He made his character so powerful that I can send him elminster as an appetizer. GUESS WHAT HE IS ONLY CR20. Heck I could send an army of BALORS and he’d kill them all. AND ONLY AT CR 20…   I can send several tarasques and it wouldn’t be a challenge. Its ok… thanks to FR, there are a lot of characters rick can fight that he won’t find challenging but love to whup their ass for the principal of him being CR20 and them being 30-40.  Well, I’m happy. I made monsters that would kill demi-gods, and he made a mortal a god. Love how this game will turn out. (for those who don’t know the hierarchy… demi gods are almost kinda gods)  Heck I can send him demogorgon and that will be the only time he would worry cause demogorgon can cast 6 times per round

       MOVIES:  I watched hell boy and it was fine. I mean I wish there was more. There was something like a feeling that there could have been more or maybe it was my own feeling that I wanted to know more.  Hellboy is quite a character. I remember someone telling me he was a kick ass hero and I asked what he does. When he told me he had a stone hand and he broke his horns off I threw it off as a joke. Watching the movie and seeing what was put to make the character so real and so original was inspirational. Hellboy is a pretty good character, I wish that the first thing people would tell me about hellboy would have been: “He has a long and interesting story to follow” then I would have not brushed it off.   GURPS:  I want gurps 4th ed NOW!!! I’m so happy I didn’t buy the 3rd ed hardbound book when I was back at NJ. I mean, my heart would have sunk pitching $30+ dollars into something that would be obsolete with in the year just to replace my torn and scrapped GURPS book.  I wish I had a printer. I’m running an adventure using gurps… for my little sister. I wish I could print out the characters and have a monster manual handy. Actually I wish there was an equivalent of a monster manual and DMG for gurps. Putting all the creatures in one place and samples of human templates from mundane character to heroic.   That’s what I wish gurps did… it would follow what it said about mundanes and heroic characters… it would make those kinds of NPC appropriate to their “importance”.    The GAME:  I’m using a solo adventure where Candy can fall back to her older brothers if she makes too many mistakes. The way it is in real life… family is there to help you get your wings.    Pet Peeves: (JUST RANTS NOT IMPORTANT)  I hate how I’m conditioned to be bitter, mean, and sarcastic… given my origins that I was gullible, good natured, well meaning and optimistic…   This guy John Paul Cunanan: Stole my 4,000+ worth of magic cards, broke my 6,000+ camera, and left me high and dry is now asking for favors. He disappeared acting like such a jerk after using me when I was in high school.   Just because I was a nice guy doesn’t mean that you can prey on me. I mean now that I’m bitter, suspicious, and very callous its hard to do whats good from my heart anymore… I hate people taking advantage of what little goodness I have left in me…   I mean look at me… I can’t… feel for the girl I really like anymore. I’m having doubts, and losing hope. I feel like just throwing my future away cause the world is soo shity.  I’m the man whose father marital advice was: “as you get older you learn to just bottle it all up and keep quiet!”    It just plain hurts. As the time to go to the states comes closer I feel like I off to another world of failures and disappointments.  Honestly, what I would like in the states is that it is a chance for me to sink or swim. If I sink then so be it… I hope I die in some gutter and everyone forgets me. That way I won’t have too much shame.   Its my chance to fail without having asked for futile help. Face it, I leaving without a degree and it is like a cancer. A huge advertisement of failure.  I’ll go to the states and die… not that I’m saying this to attract attention… just getting some steam out.  I go home to work and they are using my room to iron and do some of the laundery. I can’t tell them I’m doing something important. WHO THINKS WHAT I DO IS IMPORTANT!!!  I mean, I could always hear that my efforts are that of a mediocre man. That the only reason I got a better idea than the other guys is because I took my time to make it while the other guys started already.   THAT SUCKS… IF I TAKE SO LONG TO MAKE A GOOD IDEA!!! THEN WHAT MAKES ME BETTER THAN THE OTHER GUY!!!  I have ass kicking ideas that take sooo long to bear fruit. TOO LONG TO BEAR FRUIT!!! IF I START WORKING I END UP HATING MY DRAWINGS CAUSE I SEE A BETTER IDEA IN THE HORIZON!!!  I might as well take the rest of my life to make the most awesome idea? Nope, being original is so hard when everything is done… and what counts for originally in the approach of the retelling.  AND IF IT IS TRULY ORIGINAL AND INSIGHTFULL NO ONE WILL BE THERE TO PRAISE THE GENIOUS BECAUSE IT IS SO FAR BEYOND IT’S TIME!!!  Talk about shit.   Bottom line… I can’t live if I have no hope.   One of the reasons I took up my cross*  For all those unbaptized souls who lay in limbo BECAUSE THE CHURCH SAID SO!!! For all those people who did the good from their own hearts without any call from religion or GOD. I wanted to join them… I told myself “FUCK HEAVEN” when heaven is for people who follow the WORD OF GOD!!! IF we blamed everything on the DEVIL when it was man’s own hand that killed our saviors.  I prayed that the devil teach me everything he had to teach a mortal man about how fucked up man is compared to beings so perfect that their own existence is a universe on to itself (thank you Mr. Sese for teaching us Metaphysical Philosophy)   OF course there was no Devil to teach me everything man should learn that the BIBLE hid from mortal ears. There was no magic or supernatural event…. Just an ordinary life with luck for crap.  “There is one guarantee… non of us will see heaven” – road to perdition  I guess I put myself down since my crush won’t be available till next week and I think I’ll be too busy to ask her out. I guess its ok… not that I have a chance in heck… I see she gets hounded by a lot of guys (Which I hate… I keep thinking I’ll find girls who are unique and have really special qualities which aren’t that obvious to the greater population of guys… but its not true a lot of guys do notice) so there goes my supposedly astute perception. Well I forgot about her for a long time… 4+ months and I only remembered to check on her when I saw her and maybe enough water under the bridge for her to forget how much I liked her.  DAMN guys have to act uninterested and play the game. I for one like to act like a kid and dress up nice and say I like her… yeeeeeash!!!    * I promised myself that I will not ask GOD for help cause I hate fighting him (like a stupid kid) when things don’t go my way.

        Weird dream :  It was all about how in far off future where resources are scares. I was selling everything I had (which all are meant be  recycled) for some spare cash. In an pragmatic society I am the only artist, suffering and not making any headway for my self.  The Dream before that was Twisted, dark and very personal. It was a situation where I was supposed to betray someone. Strangely enough I’m going along with it, the part I hate is that it may come true in the future. With no real emotional anchor when I leave, I can see myself change in a way I would despise myself.   I don’t know what to do to stop what may be inevitable.   Life gets complicated when you grow up.   My last thoughts before I slept was how I can’t imagine myself in a place with some one I care deeply about. There is always the realization that this person: must pity, or she happens to be in a place in time where I am just a passing fancy, that there are always reasons with in reasons why some one would be with someone else.   There is no reason for “it”. There is no reason for feeling “that” way. Everything doesn’t last and the needs of the real world will always come first.   OF course that’s what I didn’t believe before.   I guess when some you truly cared about failed you. You tend to think the worse of every situation. Its not that I was wrong… I hate being right in these matters.  .

       WHOOOHOOOO!!!   Ok I have something to say for today that was interesting. Chez is ok with hanging out with me!!! YAAAY!!!   Backstory  Yeah, Oh well I had a big crush with Chez for most of the year and knew her ever since I got to CSB (but did not know her name at the time). Well, that’s just it, I promised myself that I won’t act like a total dork… like the last time.   So I don’t think I’ll be going out with sila Gino and Kathy on Wednesday. Unless Chez agrees to go out on a wed, and then I can finally introduce her to some of my friends. Strange, the last time we both went out was to watch Pirates, then there was daredevil and then there was this eddie Murphy film that sucked… the spy one with owen Wilson.      Today  Well got rid of my ID, I better shave and get my haircut If I want to look presentable if Chez would agree to go out and watch Hellboy with me. Filed for my LOA and they took my ID. Well this week is looking up since I’m off  my ass and doing some work.    Dreams  Watched 3 hours of Band of Brothers. The subtitles sucked; I had dreams set in very nostalgic places and a lot of sadness and sacrifices. There were no great rewards, or love storys, or success stories the lined the ending of a dream but just the ending of what was a lot of suffering.   That was a sad dream…  It was saying that I forgot something, but when do we ever remember what we forget anyway. It was trying to tell me something... something i can't figure out...  Felt bad watching it... i don't know if i'm every going to be man enough to make those kinds of sacrifices.     Gift of Prophecy  I keep notes of my dreams and write down some details that are so unusual that they don’t fit the detail of a story. Yesterday I realized the de’ja’vu (how ever it is spelled) unravel itself.   It happens now and then, usually once to twice a year. Unfortunately, none of them foretell success or love or something worth while to expect. So I guess I will be having to change my destiny from that of the mundane to that of the well better than mundane.

      Oh well I’m here just answering my mail, checking on some blogs and finding nothing interesting to do. I think I should download some online comics… The scaned ones… I need ideas.   I’m planning to watch hellboy on Wednesday. Hey Gino I’m sure you are planning to as well. Sama ako!  I’ve been itching to watch a bunch of movies. Just last Wednesday… or the last time I was with gino and kath we bought a bunch of DVDs… I watched 4 of them in one day. Of course I was drawing and stuff but I got a lot of work done that way.   I spilled some cheese cake on my lap while typing. Had a good soccer game. The defense sucked and I as the goalie let in what would be 12+ goals, we must have had 10 on our side. I wish we had a better defense.    FOR MY BIG GAME HERE IS THE BREAKDOWN   Kuma(Nico Salonga) AC60; AT+45; Contribution: 18 attacks and Damage 1d8+28 “Bard”(Henry Vargas) AC53; AT+20; Contribution: +12 to hit, +6 to damage, +8 to AC, +4hd for everyone, +8 to all saves, +40+con modifier in HP.  Moradin(Ricky Santos) AC50; AT+55; Contribution: 4 attacks but with 6d6+41 Ithiliel(Rick Velasco) AC83; AT+15; Contribution: Cannot put into words “D”(Rick Velasco) AC73; AT+30(spells); Contribution: God Slayer!!! “Red Wizard”(Vicente) AC10; AT+12; Contribution: Spells that Deal 200-400 damage Tamiel(Arj) AC60+; AT+25(spells); Contribution: Spells that Deal 100-300 damage and Melee character as well.   Alvin: I don’t know yet  What they will be fighting: In the course of a day… they will fight opponents whose total Hitpoints are 5,000, whose armor class on the average is low(AC30+) but who have +50 to hit.

      I just recovered from being sick… yesterday was it in fullswing and today I feel the residue of the Tylenol. It is so weird… Tylenol makes me trippy… I get paranoid… it was hard for me to go to the steam bath cause it made my brain fritzy   GAMING GARBLE   Well now I’m back but really sleepy and I just want to bum around. I made my monsters now. They’re pretty powerful… some of them only rick can handle… some of them Ricky can handle… I made ricky as a free action heal himself as well as be able to set up wards and gaurds… so even though he loves wading into combat he knows how to prepare for fights he can’t handle.  Thanks to glyph of warding… Warding certain objects like small objects that can open or close as well clay seals that can be broken. He has placed the seals in various places on his armor… much like studded armor would work and if the seals break (from damage of more than 10 points) the cause of the damage would suffer a empowered harm spell dealing 225damage against caster 18. He keeps a glue solvent to replace the seals when they’re broken. He also keeps a lot of incense in back pack to make glyph traps… each would cost 400gp and scrolls of harm 4,000 each (empowered, caster level 20). He makes traps if he needs it and has a +43 to hit on a full attack with his 6d6+33 (54damage ave) medium creatures must roll vs. death DC15 against his damage or die.   Vicente’s character is a 50 year old red wizard (old gives a +2 to all mental, and –2 to all physical stats), who is with his 20 year old son who is also a red wizard so much like him. The son is –1 to caster level checks and skill checks… that’s the only difference.   They are both invisible and perpetually floating 24hours, mind blank negates any spell that will be used to detect them… all divination spells… but scent and spot checks DC40 can notice them. That is why they still prepare resilient spheres to protect themselves… while they are invisible they have a simulacrum of themselves handy so that they can use a spell that reverses their position via teleport incase they take damage. They have only a dread guard (humanoid construct) polymorphed to look like them and is mentally under their command.  You can say a cute puppet so that everybody has something to look at. Fiendish quickening allows the father son to switch places with anybody as a free action… a powerful way.   So this is how it goes: Henry is a Monk with Vow of Poverty… he has touch of golden ice… he has to touch a bad guy 30x just for the badguy to fail his save eventuall and suffer the ravages (1d6 dex/2d6 dex).  Ricky is a tactician dwarf cleric that goes berserk or makes traps when facing something not tactically sound. Vicente is a Red wizard and his son who has the ability to keep changing place with their dummies and mirror images if they are about to take damage.  Kuma CR18, Ithi EL15, Tamiel EL18 Powerful combo for powerful characters. Total EL 23  The badguys- EL22 for 1 day’s worth of work…  1) A cleric badguy who can summon Balors every round to do his bidding.(CR18) 2) Incarnate construct with 54HD turned into vampires with a +53 to hit on a flurry dealing 1d6+20 and 2 negative levels… double on a critical hit as well as stunning fists DC44. (CR15 each, 3 of them makes EL18 fighting them in grill incrusted area where they can excape with ease) 3) 2 medium sized night walker maxed HD and with 2 dread wraiths (CR18) 4) A CR19 46 headed hydra that can deal (483 damage on average, Ref DC 45)  Of course there are the secret ways of beating them.  Another Day EL21 1 kytons + 1 Eryniyes EL20 fighting them in a chain factory (call me a prick) Seductress CR19  Another Day  EL 22 Monsters I’m still making

      I got the internet running finally.   Yesterday I went to Paolo Rosero’s party… I mean exhibit. It was in sanctum, in intramuros. I’m not a bar hopper and not the type to do so ever, and I know why. I was able to bring candy along as well as take some pictures of me and pao to have before I go to the states.   He was glad to see me… very glad. I have to admit I was is only person who still is his friend in southridge. Its not a bad thing… I like paolos freedom, I envy the fact that he’s been making a fortune selling paintings and he has had more growth than me artistically. The guy is still a “virgin” in terms of love and can fall for a girl pretty hard and pretty easily. Looking at the company I keep I one of the guys who feel that there is no merit in it anymore.   Paolo is kick ass, at about 10,000 to 20,000 pesos per paining he can easily make a living selling one a month. Of course he better make at least 20k a month given how much he needs to make a painting. Paolo invited me to get wasted like the old days one last time. I can’t decline… paolo has always been a cool cat in my book. He may have a funny way of acting but he is still a good natured person trying to capture what it is to love and live.   Simple aint it. I mean his life is pretty ideal when he has the ability and means to get what makes him happy, let his heart be broken and make a couple of expensive paintings to pay the rent. I mean talk about living… he has his pain, his work, and his pleasure… not to mention his love. Paolo must fall in love 2 a year… that means he has his whole being and passions flaring up for someone and let his own feeling get scalded and keep on going.   I mean that’s cool… think about it… you don’t have the disappointment of learning the person may be a bitch or imperfect in a way you may never accept her and she is only as good as the memory.  That’s pretty damn cool… but of course only some people can see the merit of living that life.  I, for one, am not one of those people.   Candy was telling how uncomfortable she feels in the crowd. It is a “face” crowd people carrying a certain “face” and a level of guard up. We are more used to letting it all hang out- flaws and idiosyncrasies. These people have a proper way of acting and a proper way of looking. I understand why we stick out like a sore thumb.   Its not a bad thing, it’s a different set of rules for a different kind of life. Of course being the way we are- how me and my friends are its not my taste of how I like my world. I like the flaws and the idiosyncrasies, they remind me that the person makes mistakes like me… I don’t get misinformation about their motives and things are simple enough that it is easy to bring an emotion or an idea across.   You have to really be strong to be the kind to live in that world. Strong in a way that you have your guard up and always being a step ahead. I can’t live there, I like not caring what people think, I like being “dirty” and “simple”. Life is complicated as it is, do I want it anymore complicated. Anyway the complication I like in life is in the profoundness of being and the relationship we have with everyone around us… why make up other elements to baffle me or everyone else.  Like I said to my first gf- “if you want sex just tell me, don’t give me hints or clues or lead me to it simple because my uptight upbringing will make me ignore it” (not the exact words but the exact idea)  I also learned that my lola didn’t like her cause she was short. What does that mean… she wants a tall chick for me?

       Current News:  I am in CSB… accurately in Netopia in University Mall. I’m here fixing and updating my blog as well as checking out everyone elses. I will be meeting the Big Cheese here later so that we can go to Gamer’s Shop together.   Henry will try to make Benj. Rewind that part of the adventure. I though that would be better to save Benj’s efforts. Although I wish I could edit my character still.   I’m at CSB getting a LOA form and transcript. I hope I can get this all done soon.   I hope mom doesn’t send me to the Factory for Wednesday so that I can finish gaspars papers and mine as well by tom… if he gets my email by then.   RPGbarkada@yahoogroups.com is now up and we  can post the cheese as they happen. I hope to post my homebrew 1865 there as well as my D20 Rifts inspired Game setting rules as well.     Movies:  Yesterday I watched the following movies. Last Samurai, Somethings Gotta Give, Love Actually and Timeline.    Strategy:  After watching Last Samurai I realized how much tactics in soccer will simulate tactics in battle. Which are Holes in the defense, When and how to attack, Holding the Line, and Cooperative Attacks.   Realizing this similarity I have a better idea of how tacticians and leaders organize and use an army.   My first realization is that: 1- Teams- Units must know how to cooperate. Yeah I know its basic but I now know this aspect as the tactician in how to train my troops (or players) to coordinate attacks.  2- Maneuvers- Fundamentals and Skill is so important in creating a army that it can be dizzying just making up a number of maneuvers to anticipate different strategies in battle. An veteran unit compared to a heavily trained but green unit will only have a difference in morale…  Mastery of Manuevers can make an inexperienced unit as good as an experienced one. They just need confidence… which brings me to the next aspect. 3- Leadership- The tactician must always be a good leader as well. He must be able to give the troops the mindset to go father than their own mental limits would tell them. Tactics is separate from leadership as these two elements carry equal weight in combat or skirmish.   Of course a lot of other people know a version of this… this just happens to be my own realization.   Another point in my realization is training a team.  If me and my brothers train as a team with our own strengths: -I’ll be leadership and tactics -Mel would be skill and skirmishes -Gas would be strength and toughness.   All we would need is Ranged support… That would be candy… if she has the stomach for it.    In soccer (given Urdaneta) It would be Gino and Joff at the aggressive front Then It would be Me at midfield with one wingman (preferably left) Then Ton would be goalie and 3 staunch defenders.    Sparring:  Read “Timeline” by Michael Criton it is something the Arma would love. And a really good book too.     Empower Spell:  I thought it can, heck even Charles did when we saw the wording in 3.5. If you read it, you will also find that it increases number of targets (which is rarely variables). So you fire more missles with a magic missle empowered and more damage as well.

      Today We will be playing soccer in a crowded field in Urdaneta village too bad there is not enough fields out there for those who want to play. Given that soccer is a sport suited to Filipinos more than basketball which favors height… soccer needs agility which Is more evident when your center of gravity is lower such as some stocky Filipino soccer players… they are smaller but more agile.   Ideas   Well I realized that with the generic class system I can make prestige classes for more specialized abilities at 6-10th level. Why am I talking about this… its because I am inspired by rifts to make my own mixed genre game. Gurps 4th ed won’t be coming out till august but the D20 variant rules are out.   What would fit in a Rifts-Inspired Setting? -Generic Classes -Defense System -Spontaneous Casting- Spell points rule  -DR armor  -Using D20 modern for the technology and pricing cybernetic items the same as magical items but at 50% the cost and it is more available… but have the disadvantage of needing repairs and maintenance as well as power supply.  - Energy Points per day can be used to keep track of the consumption of powered armors, weapons and misc; the same way a wizard would cast some 24hour duration spells. If I want my armor to give me a +4 mech bonus for strength I would spend 3ep +12ep (for 24 hour perioud) - Disadvantage feats - Cybernetics should be a simple rule such as that it occupies body slots and there are partial and full cybernetic conversions.  They should count as equipment and have a Energy Point supply.  - PrC would be like a Psi-Warrior (for *cyber knight and psi-warrior), psion (for the *mind melter) then Prestige paladins, Rangers, Bards and other stuff.  - I guess Sneak attack would be a feat.  - If anything else I’ll just add the next post.   So if I wanted to be a borg soldier… I just have to save up for the equipment or I guess contract some service as collateral when loaning money for it. Then progress normally as soldier… unless I become special forces borg (which is the equivalent of a ranger) then I make the requirements of the prestiege class.   Juicers aren’t that feasible in the near future, those were in the days of the Early 90s and Late 80s. They would be better called nano borgs and the older one called mech borgs. Nano may be heck more expensive but it only has a cosmetic advantage, but since it helps enhance human functions such as healing, constitution, resistances. They make for a faster augmented human, while mech borgs will always be stronger tougher (because of armor), while nano borgs would be better off being faster and stealthy. Of course  these two can mix.   Loosing one’s sense of touch would certainly differentiate a nano borg and a mech borg cause touch has something to do with sense of balance and a lot of things that make us react at the speed we do now.   * Rifts owned

      Well nothing much other than I’m loosing sleep to a rash and I’m trying to escape church. I must have walked 5km just ditch church… That was a 30 minute walk to a fast food cause I hated the fasting… its ruining my diet.   On another note I regret answering a troll. But being attacked at that point was really hitting below the belt. I know a lot of trolls like doing that… I don’t know why they lash out… are they as dysfunctional and misunderstood as Psychopaths and tyrants.  GAMES I’m confused by the Masochism spell. Does the bonus last for the duration or only the next round… and if it is for the duration what happens if I Persistent it. Is it the total damage in a round or the damage during the whole duration.   It is a spell that can be Persisted so what’s up with it. I can just empowered harm and heal myself and for the rest of the day I have a +22 luck bonus to all attacks, saves and skill checks.   So what’s up.   I found a way to heal myself as a free action. With greater glyph of warding I enchant a pouch on me if I don’t say the command word when reaching inside it casts heal on the person that reaches inside. Simple and only costs 400gp per pouch enchanted.

      Well this is how it went down.  There was a fire themed dungeon and we were half way through it. There was a riddle about ignoring the child of the earth and bringing the red flower to avoid the fate of ashes, in the puzzle there was a potted rose and a torch both glowing with magic… I was doodling and not paying attention I took the flower.   The next one was go to the cat’s eye and avoid the path into the earth. We went to the right path which was the cat’s eye but didn’t bring the torch which was the correct instrument.   There was a path of coal and a shimmering rainbow pattered wall in the end. Vlarg (henry’s character) heroically charged forward with the rose and entered the wall of light… which by then we realized could have been a prismatic wall… the GM was being easy on us and henry. He let henry roll versus death instead of killing him but henry died anyway. So we watched the heroic figure of Vlarg come out like a confused burning figure that’s stumbles and falls dead. Seeing that we can’t continue… charles suggests to go to the path of earth.   The lapse of common sense was still high with in us after henry’s hilarious death so we followed Charles’ suggestion.    We were wracked with 42 damage fireballs and I saved but still died cause I only had 18hp. Everyone else failed and died.   Benj, our Gm was so distraught. He let us reincarnate since a whole town owes us it’s life. So I got turned into a dwarf from what was a kalamaran gray-elf, henry half-orc to a gnoll, while the rest stayed the same.   So that was that.  TODAY  So RJ for what may be the last time I see him before I leave for the states. I happy he has made so much progress and has a lot of great things to look forward to in the future.   Went to Arj’s house warming and played munchkin and frag. Lost but had a whole lot of fun.

      Well I forgot to do some errands which I will do tomorrow. I just hope that the mall is open. I got really not so much drawing done. I got the head work finished… now I have to change the body. I’m kinda’ a perfectionist… well bragging and with no proof of what I am saying except those who met me and seen my works I know I’m a midlevel artist and my skill has a long way to go in development… its just that I can’t start officially till I have a good style… One’s basic style is what will determine their overall development.  There are a lot of bad habits in the perfection of style that I must avoid and overcome before the practice is repeated or they will be ingrained. This might sound like an excuse but anybody who understands comic art can look at the worst hack of em all and see that he has not changed in the 5 years he disappeared. Yeah you know him… he sucks and he is one of the elements that caused the crash of comics…   Looking at his art now… that’s how good I was drawing 6 years ago… now that is a problem. There are shortcuts that should not have been taken and quality that should have been maintained.   The Progress towards realism has been amazing… It started with Jim Lee’s hero… (someone I forgot his name… help me out gino)… and others followed. I hope to be the one know for how I make Characters look good in their clothes as my style developes… I don’t see any practicality in form fitting clothes when Kevlar or armor would be more practical for a super hero or an action oriented character… given sheer statistics… a more believable character is better wearing armor than showing off his 1 hour a day at the gym body… or be realistic with body types that fit their combat preference… You wont see guys with protein supplemented or steroid induced musculature unless that was what made those muscles that big or an explained supernatural means…   I may be a stickler to details… but explaining those little details make the characters even more special by the amount of time or dedication they put into developing those skills and attributes. I hope that I can be known for developing superheroes with abilities that are special concerning the experience the hero had in developing them.   Being a gamer… experience is integral into become anything. Like in GURPS and DND.. experience is what molds a character… I can’t see a character that is static and does not develop mentally, physically, and professionally. There are also weakness and pitfalls in become a master or a heroic character…   Like many of the new writers in this era of comics… they want comics to maximize their story telling… Of course I’m just an artist… but I still have my hand in the telling. I just hope people notice it… the little details.

      Anyway I mad some progress and I am on my way. It pretty cool and all.   Funny Dad doesn’t know about it all yet… infact mom never said anything to since he arrived. Its ok. I have yet to finish the art and the stuff for the comic.   Oh well Mel don’t worry about your gamer problems too much. The Guys will be moving in time to Jersey with us so it doesn’t have to be sad about who we can game with.   I watched the Passion of the Christ and it was pretty good. I mean what can I say… I’m not catholic although I was raised it.   I can’t say it is anti-sametic… neither can I say it to be anti-protestant although I’m sure Opus Dei and some extremist Catholics would love to rally by their “passion” or the movie.   Funny that people the whole world over call him jesus but his name is pronounced far from it: “Hesua” is more of how they pronounced it then. It really puts a different spin on something some people may have thought of themselves as experts of.  Hmmm I guess I learned a little more humility about my views and judging on simply what I see or read than really going to the source and seeing this with a whole idea of what a matter is all about.   But I gotta say it’s a cool movie... Hey Pat reading this, here is a wink back at ya for teaching me to see things this way he he he…   So the matter for today is working…    GAMING:   I’m starved for a good game… I can’t help it I need the rush and the blood flowing back into my veins. I hope that I can pray to my ancestors that I have the strength to do great in my art. As well as constant inspiration.    BTW Game Next week… Were ending my long campaign so hope to see you all then.

      We celebrated Rj’s belated birthday yesterday and played a good game of soccer. That was a day that certainly recharged our week.   Today Gino, Cath, Tweet and I might meet up RJ to watch the passion. We just hope he is available so we could continue our talk. We were at MB the whole night talking time away till 12:30. We were there just as it was closing and we had so much in terms of conversation that we had to cut it short for the night.   So anyway I better be getting to work.

      Working on the comic is all I can do. I can finish half of it by the time we leave for the states. I just hope I can keep the laptop till then. But mom says the company needs it. I was saying if they did then they shouldn’t have lent it to me… talk about making it more complicated.   I guess that teaches me to ever use guilt on my children. Or let their mother do that. I was too guilty failing in the beginning to ask for money… enough money to get a proper upgrade. I guess I’m used to not having enough money, which is something I’ve been training hard to do.  Start looking for an apartment dude, were moving out into one when I get there. They can cost to 2,000 a month… I’ll try to go for a grand. Until I get the Job we won’t know much we can make our budget.    With a small combined income between me and jasper maybe we can make ends meet for the four of us.

       The Cat is out of the Bag:   I never believed that I would drop out of school. I guess to those people who know me and follow my blog they know the circumstances around it, they also know my character as a person and what made things conspire to put me in this position to fail.  The most painful thing I ever had to bear is to see my mother watch me fail. Every bit of hope was lost from her from finding out from me what happened.   Another painful thing was that my lola had no faith in me and told my Tita’s in the states about it. OUCH!!! Talk about knowing where it runs in the family!!!   My mom told me she was planning a party when I graduate… She told Tita Bebet… OUCH!!! Again.  I am in shattered pieces when I am writing this. Coherence is something I have at my disposal right now but I better put everything down now.   “I AM NOT LAZY!!!” Is what I screamed/ I believe it and I know it… its just my mom doesn’t believe me. I guess no one will believe me but my friends and brothers.   That’s funny. Cause why do my parents have to be my friends for them to believe me. They have always been just my “parents”. I guess with that kind of relationship it will certainly fail. I could never be truly honest with them that’s for sure… I’ve change so much that they don’t know who I am.  How can they stand an agnostic son who screwed around and has such wide and liberal views. Its not a matter of being something of a social stigma but being someone my parents cannot accept.   Always with the distance and always with the independence?!  SHOULD I HAVE ASKED THEM FOR A BRAND NEW COMPUTER IN THE VERY BEGINNING?  MEL!? Do you think that is something I would ask or the way were raised. As my brother can enlighten anybody it is not something within us to ask for an extravagance like a computer… its just not the way I knew how to do things.   Tim told me not to regret what happened and dwell on the mistakes he was there to bear witness to. BUT DAMN did those mistakes hurt like hell and it gave me the last impression of the country that sired me…   The actions I was taking were the best I could make at the time… GIVEN WHAT I KNEW!!! Was I ignorant or could I have avoided it.   BUYERS BEWARE?!? Heck we were buying from Virra Mall as far as I remember. Where else would I go when computers came to mind….    Future  OK what was once here was two pages of “what ifs and if onlys”. I deleted them simply cause they serve no purpose but to push me farther into depression. My mom accepting my failure has allowed me to work without concern anymore.   OF course I CANT WORK NOW GIVEN MY STATE OF MIND.   But planning my action is still my priorites… I have no time to mourn my own FAILURE. I must struggle to push my mind forward toward the task at hand.    The Task at Hand  The Art is good… but I could do better. Not that I have time to practice… I repeat saying that it has been 6 years since I was doing comics. Going back into them now with an artist’s perspective instead of fan’s has helped greatly.   Thanks to Gino also for constructive criticism and perspective in the endeavor since I don’t know shit and his place is a better workstation for doing creative thinking than mine. (There are no fruits at home and comfort feeding is a bad habit to develop especially in the states where there are more snacks.) I was confused and redid the artwork poorly and Gino’s opinion and Cathy’s too, I might add, helped me get a outside opinion of my work. Which gets confusing with all the extra symbols, layouts, and progress in making the characters get to where they are going.   Their criticism is just enough for me to get through and still have enough confidence to do better.    Tomorrow  There is soccer and drawing tomorrow even if it is a Saturday. I getting stuff done and slowly getting into a real groove. I just hope I survive my dad’s… but my dads a guy he has his way of dealing with what happened. I just hope not the way he used to when we were kids.    Noticing Things  I have to admit. When Gino told me the time his dad called him dumb when he couldn’t do these certain tasks as a kid… I remembered how my own dad was angry at me when I couldn’t do some things right*. I guess as hindsight, we can be more forgiving and more encouraging as fathers.    Having this discussion with my mom was so unreal… cause I was so scared that she would know so badly that when it was happening I talked and argued I could not feel a single emotion and had to ACT the way I should feel. It just hit me leaving cause the last time I argued was when I moved to CSB and I told her I won’t quit. I GAVE HER MY WORD I WONT QUIT AND THIS HAPPENS. IT FEELS LIKE A QUIT, but I stopping myself so hard not to be dragged down.  Am I lying to myself that I worked hard… I look back and my grades spoke for themselves a 2.8 GPA in my whole stay… my reputation among my teachers said the same too… infact I put in 300 hours of recorded OJT hours in my last term while I did 2 other subjects and 100 other yet to be filed OJT hours. One of these subjects was my thesis…  SHIT I FUCKING WORK HARD… everybody who defended their OJT HOURS ONLY SHOWED 120 at the most!!! I WAS THE FUCKING MOST!!! I WORKED MY BUT OFF!!! And NO ONE BELIVES ME WHEN I SAY I DID MY BEST!!!  I have proof that In character I worked the hardest… too bad my mom doesn’t know that I literally redo my projects most of the time because I’m my worst critic. The most I ever redid was to do something 3 times per plate… what was in color theory since I was alien to colors. I got a 95% not bad for a guy who knew nothing about colors in the begin with.   At least I end with having enough proof for myself that I wasn’t lying and that making the mistake in trusting my own countryman was the worst thing I could do.   MAN I’m so used to Patrick being around… he is usually the first person to tell me if I’m being had. I guess after this experience this would be my last lesson before I go to the state and end up in a problem in the proportion of dollars not pesos.   * I remember when I was in gradeschool my dad was so angry that I could not write number for either left to right or right to left… I can’t remember. I remember shouting allot from mom and dad… and my dad gripping down on my hand as me forced my had to write the way he wanted… I remember crying and being confused- I didn’t understand why he was so angry at me and my mother shouting that it works and it should not matter. My dad walked away soo pissed and I remember crying and doing the home work till I was so sleepy I fell asleep crying on this old marble table back in san juan.   Remembering that I was just like Dale (brat of a cousin) I guess that’s why dale acts the way he does. I can’t help but look back in time at the way he acts.

      Ok I’m here in gino’s place and we will be eating soon.   I told Lola about my predicament, and was hoping to tell dad but he left for a seminar and just my luck.   I was hoping to check out other things that happens. So far not much activity. Not that I would like something to happen cause I am already to busy. Anyway…   RAMON AND MARIA   Maria really is looking for ramon. All her past lovers were just prototypes of him and he still longs for her. Funny, I wish I could do something but since ramon is out of reach and maria is someone I don’t know personally.   I just wish they find each other… or she would admit she misses him or some form of reconciliation or closure.  I want to help my friend but I don’t know how… so far I’ve been a big bolero and just help keep his morale up and confident about what he is doing.   Anyway soccer tomorrow… and mass aswell I hope to find the opportunity to talk to my dad about the problem before I tell my mom who will die with the knowledge.

       Reply to Mel   Well i guess if Even one of my “forever and ever”(yeah right) crushes were to go to visit me and ask me. But then again- why would I, I don’t think I can fall again unless I settle some issues the first being -Achievement.   My first GF made the excuse that I was hopeless and didn’t amount to anything in the future. Wow talk about moral support from the woman you love: well it has become a stigma… I can’t find myself on grounds to have a relationship unless I am superior in the sense of achievement- at least to my personal standard.   Being a College Drop-Out does not help at all: what chick would dig a guy who did not finish college?!  WOMEN FROM A COUNTRY WHERE IT DOESN’T MATTER SO MUCH!!!  So I guess women of my own country don’t consider me a “catch” but can I blame them? That is the stigma. Anyway, why should it bother me, when I go to the states I aint Planning to come back. Why come back to a country that will not recognize you for your talents, ability and contributions.   OTHER RAMBLINGS  >>> this is where optimists start putting on their yelps of the country’s positive points: In my opinion is that The Philippines was a place worth living before the time of Marcos. Who the fuck cares if he was genius… Give me a Magsaysay over a tyrant any day. I would also like to mention the many men and women of great moral character that passed away in that bygone age.   I just say Marcos can rot in hell as well as for his descendants that live of the decadence he had created. I wont’ see any redemption unless they set thing right with the money they stole and give it back to the people marcos murdered and exploited from.   If your not a Filipino know that the Marcoses still control a huge amount of the Political and economic power in the Philippines despite what their Sire did. They live of the blood money of the innocence and are happy to escape the justice that they deserve.   I’m sure many other tyrants are alive in this world aside from these guys… but they are a pivotal point in the history of the Philippines when things went bad… Hitler can’t even compare cause Germany recovered, human rights became ever more pro-active and important… the Philippines never did recover and is spiraling down. All the efforts of Rizal, Bonifacio, Aguinaldo, Gomburza, and all the heroes who fought for independence and one nation was his toilet paper, which he was so happy to flush down.   Man I just really hate that Guy… cool thing is: my family name is the family that Rivals his. I wish it was a sign from god or that destiny means me to have the power to set things right.  BUT I guess that is why comics are my weapons in the end. Hopefully if the story goes to far I can tackle how I hate that family… and make them the bad guys.   Oh yeah, kiss the bottom of my shoe bI’ach!!

       To Mel:  Thanks for the salute: strangely I am the most… dirty and wretched of the people i know(except for some people i know who i completely dispise and live to ruin other people: yeah and that person knows my blog whoop de do!)!?! Anyway, I know you have something coming it terms of a passionate relationship. As your brother and assuming how we both can reach such a high gaming, fighting and storytelling: I can gander that we both would (love) at the same extreme.   It’s a good and a bad thing: good is that sex was 10x better when I remember it than when I do it now. The bad thing is that we fall faster and harder. Remember how bitter and cynical I was… its not that I don’t want you to experience that but the cool thing about me being the man in charge is that you can crash and burn and have a me and the guys around to fix the rig.   Do you remember how I always struggled and asked for so much advice on my problem. I end up having these long discussions with Pat, Henry, and Trish about relationships. Struggling to mentally keep afloat that the world isn’t a shit hole when someone has the power to crush the life out of you with a stare.   The feeling in a break up when the girl keeps up all appearance that everything is fine while your in constant torment and depression… its like you were just a footnote. She says that its her fault and it doesn’t make anything feel better. Rage swells and erupts unexpectedly and you feel like saying things so hurtful which aren’t true : “like I never really loved you or I just used you for the sex.”  Man you will feel that and more… things get complicated especially when you see each other unexpectedly…    It’s a good thing your finishing community college. Take a break, get a job and help me and jas pay the bills :P get a GF or a fling and see how fun it can be and how bad it can be before you go to a university…   AND LASTLY   Like me, after a while you will find your groove and priorities remember that amongst the brothers you may be the only one carrying the name to a new generation.     ON OTHER THINGS   Going to mom’s office to print out my drawing studies… they look weird. It’s a bunch of pictures of me in various poses and laid out with other pictures of me to form a group picture. They are great for understanding structure proportion and distance but it looks weird when people see me print out pictures of me trying to look cool.

       SAD DAYS (JUST RIGHT AFTER ONE REALLY HAPPY ONE)   I had a sad dream and ironically it was also a sad morning. Lolo and Lola left for Cotobato just an hour ago.   It’s a sad time for me given that is I’m leaving. I found someone and I’m leaving. Its pretty ironic (again) given that I found someone who really is meant for me (and vice versa) yet I’m leaving cause I have to deserve it.   I don’t want to be a bum, I want to contribute in what ever way comes to me. I’m 25 and it would be nice to have what all the other more “successful” guys my age have. Although, I don’t fret too much now; Its oddly calming that it is a pretty good reason and I feel like I got whats coming to me.   Mom and I had an argument. Again the lame-ass parents counter argument is that “you don’t understand”. The argument arose when mom scolded me for lending her video tapes to our relatives who have forgotten to return it. Of course I found it pretty simple to say that: I though that’s what you wanted me to do.  She said yes but still continued to chew me down. So of course you can understand my feeling and kept saying in my defense: THEN I WON’T LEND ANYTHING TO OUR RELATIVES ANYMORE! Simple.  If you get pissed at me because I lent stuff to relatives, then my reaction is to regret it and not do it anymore. Isn’t that what getting mad at your son is all about.  I went to bed as soon as I had the chance. What point was there to feeling this way if all I can do is be destructive. I hate how moms are fickle.   I know as teenagers you can’t see outside yourself. Its really hard to be a teenager when your parents have no diplomacy skills. I have to say that even if I don’t have much of a negotiating or expository skill, I can still use calm and subtle words to convey my point of view and ask the other person what they think.   A skill I learned from being open minded, when I was raised around furious religious intolerants and the people I admired always handled things with kindness, consideration and with open minds.   These are 3 aspects I always hope to emulate given that you deal with things with more finesse than brute strength.    GAMES  I made above average characters in Gurps that are pretty cheesed (or more accurately portraying my ideal character). I realized I have no arm strength. I work so much on my legs and my stamina My arms don’t any of my attention. I better work on them, I wish I had free weights in Christine’s apartment.   MOVING I getter get a list of things (chores) she wants me to do so that I can get out of her way. I’m not interested forging a close relatioinship given that we are really different. Suffice to say I am not as ambitious or worldly as her. I’d rather have a lot more friends than a lot more money would be a good example.   My lack of ambition is I guess a weakness, or the fact that I learned early on that time loved ones make me more happy than anything else. I know money is needed for a lot of things, like going out and stuff. I actually save up for that. I will get a job do illustrations (as a part time most probably). I know I will be working on a day job and that would pay the bills, drawing will be the job that gets me money to save with.   Dad says I might be able to get my citizenship in 3 years. If that’s the case I going home to someone as soon as I get it (given that she hasn’t moved on or with anyone). I know at least that much about that part of my life. It is something to really look forward to.   I had dreams when I was young that I would come for her but I was too late. It haunts me, and this would count as a premonition of what’s there to come. I just hope that would not come true (if that would be true, how the dream ended was basically what would happen if it did).

      Well yesterday was GREAT!!!  I spent the WHOLE DAY in perpetual bliss. Wow, It great to be alive! I’m so happy, words escape me.   I found out something new, found out something else, and found something there I didn’t see before.   I slept 7 hours and I’m up and at ‘em. I don’t know why, but things balanced out. By Friday I will back to zero, and what I have earned will be gone.   That sucks. I don’t think that will happen again. I wish I could have done more. I wish I stayed.   … BUT I NEED A JOB. I  NEED A CAREER. Then I would feel like I DESERVE to stay, and I would feel like I would DESERVE what was given to me.   Till then, I pray for success. I have all the cards now. I very happy that the only thing missing is something I can get from hard work. What I have now, may never have come despite the role of fate.

      I was planning to change my Friendster profile.   Ok I organized some of my material for my GURPS conversion.  I converted GURPS Fantasy Yrth to my setting as the Kingdome of Anister. Basically I kept it the same but added more bloody politics.   Elandria is a Imperial Republic ruled by a emperor with a senate. It is a welfare state, drawing a huge amount of wealth from it trade with the Federation (the Dwarven Government). Eladria keeps its people’s welfare intact by putting as much weight on its enemies as it can. Eladria engages heavily in infiltration, Assassinations, and Piracy. A means by which it is able to negate it’s deficits. With Basic Rights, Social mobility, an army the strength and size of the Golden Age of Rome, the Crown of Fire as a means to ensure the Emperor is always loyal to it’s people, and an the largest and Intelligence Agency in the world Eladria is a medieval super power.  Anister on the other hand, is a Feudal kingdom that is not to far from Eladria. The only reason Elandria has not attacked it is simply because it has already reached its most manageable size. Anister can be compared to a lot of classic fantasy settings of a medieval kingdom and a young, Idealsit and untested king.       Some Home-brew Rules:   Natural Strength is a 40% discount in buying strength. It basically means the character has a higher base strength. It is the combination of no bonus fatigue –30%, no Bonus to skills –5% and no bonus to jumping 5% (which I find redundant since jumping is a “skill”). But in the alternate rule when Fatigue comes from Health and HP comes from Strength what happens. I guess this is one of the annoying things about GURPS. Unlike the designers of d20 gurps haven’t gotten around to explaining the consequences of an optional rule. I have to admit that it is a bit of old school to have to keep checking with the rest of the GURPS community to find out how something works.   I posted a bunch of questions in the Gurps mailing list. I hope I get through to some people.

      Power less…  …In WORK. As an artist (here he goes again!) I feel powerless without a scanner and printer. I do not care if it was a black and white printer, so long as I can print text and reference material. I wish my scanner was working, I accidentally shoved it when I was getting something in the dark and well… it fell. Nothing bad visibly, the glass pane (which I assumed to be the most fragile part) was intact but it stopped working.   I wish I could scan… I cant go to mom to scan cause I’m awake when the office is closed.   …in Soccer My shoes broke again. I guess I forgot to mention that tiny detail. It broke 2 games after I just got it fixed. I have to admit that soccer is a pretty rough sport. I just wish my shoes lasted longer. When they fixed my shoes I can’t say good as new, cause new meant it would keep working for another 6 months of abuse.   I wish I really made a lot of money.   …Why was I bitching about these two things. Its because, I can’t draw, thus can’t make money, thus can’t buy shoes, thus can’t work out to keep the cycle going.   Oh well. I am forced to swallow my pride and secretly ask dad for money. I can ask him for starting capital for drawing supplies when I’m in the states.  It will take me a couple of weeks to begin work ever since my scanner broke, working was pretty hard for me. I hate going so far to scan, it ruins the momentum.   Wala lang… I guess. I just wish I was drawing right now instead of being depressed… I cant buy a scanner cause I’m leaving, and I can’t work cause I can’t buy a scanner.

      Candy’s hogging the computer again and I am itching to run gurps. I’ll just run one in Jersey. I hope I can find a place to run it and a group. I have a lot of homebrew rules. Gurps is still not yet standardized, unlike D20 so I have to wait a while until the official 4th ed rules will be out.   I guess GURPS wont get as big as DnD, but I guess its loyal following base is pretty high. Its got it going better than D20 and White Wolf in terms of playable range. You can even play Palladium Games RIFTs with it.    Remembering  I first found gurps when I went to the states at the 96. I wanted a game that would make more sense and more range in playablity. GURPS was hard for me to understand at first, but I still played it. I was frustrated after a while and started playing ADD again. I borrowed  Andre’s and Paolo Rosero’s books and ran my games with it. I completely forgot about it until Bobby showed me what you can do with the system. He ran Warhammer 40k, gritty and bloody, It was so much fun even when you can die from one bullet wound.   That’s when I got the bug again. Now, 7 years from the last time I started playing, I’m back. L5R has come and Gone, DnD has gone through a face lift and White wolf had its Apocalypse. GURPS players just watch and continue to play on, given that they can play anything with such a dynamic and flexible system.

      I have a headache. Every night I cook chorizo, sinangag and fried egg. Artery chocking goodness and right now my head aches. Soccer was good but I was disappointed with my performance. Those are the breaks, there is nothing I can do about it.   I was watching about National Geographic about Vikings. The Vikings had better but heavier mail. I guess that would be DR4. In Dnd the Chainmail is the Viking mail and a suit of non-viking mail would be light mail or chain shirt.    I think I’ll take a pill. Motrin or alaxan. Which ever is available.

Its now 3:56 and i'm running late for urdaneta. I hope there are people to play soccer with. I need the practice.   I had a wierd dream. I forgot since candy kept delaying me from the computer. I hate  that.   I had a good time yesterday. Such a good time i was paranoid something bad would happen. Well i guess it did, i overslept.

      I just woke up.  I had an interesting dream.   Dream 1:  This was a frightening but not enough to be a nightmare. I dreamed this old “friend” of mine who I had differences with was stalking me. He was trying to reforge friendship in the manner that was… well scary. We didn’t get along since I disapproved of him paying this guy to fuck him and that kinda vice got things more complicated. In short he was getting what-ever he wanted through what ever means. Suffice to say, he freaked me out when he wanted to do the same with me (truth be told this part really happened) so I got freaked out and disappeared like I always do.  In the dream he was stalking me and was so persistent it led to me leaving traps behind. It was like I knew if he would go this far to stalk me he would get himself killed and in trouble. Unfortunately that did not stop him. The he started leaving traps for me.   There was a scene where I go to this room, and I fall asleep only to find out the room was a false one and a box. He would not open it till I submitted. That was scary… but I got out. I had a small grenade and I threw it in the toilet. The toilet was false so it did not flush but contained the explosion. I got bloodied up but I got out.   There was a point I found out he was a ghost. He was drunken in his hedonism he died, without any satisfaction. So he began hunting what he can’t have. Scary, cause he mimicked the living and when I took a swing at him with a old kitchen cleaver he kept coming at me. I collect swords (real ones) so I took two of them and began butchering him. I was watching my self butcher this guy who would not stop dying. It was frustrating. After being bodied and unbowed in several encounters with him I began shouting at him. I was saying he can keep coming an I will keep killing him cause I would never stop fighting- I live for this, I ended.  He stopped, he was a quiter. He always was as I remember him. That’s why started paying for sex in the first place, he quite those whose affections he can win and started buying it.    Dream 2:  I was out with a bunch of guys with their families. It was the future and they were all happy. I was happy cause we went to this out of this world beach with purple skies (in the morning) and a cooler smaller sun. It took me a while to figure out that we were in another planet.   Well there was this problem that occurs in the group of old friends. One of them started an investigation over their past when it seems people have started dying in our vacation. There was so much fuss over their “mission” when they were young. It seemed like something terrible happened and it was kept secret from everyone.   When my own investigation and questioning gave me enough of the truth, I noticed that there was one more person missing during the whole vacation. That person was “with” them but when I found the corpse and strange ritual markings I my stock knowledge of where it could be from led me to some terrible conclusions.   Again it was a murderer from their past. Someone was killing them and sabotaging the way home. When I discovered what happened I explained everything to them.  When they were younger they were trapped in a place by a cult. Where ever it was, which they could not remember at their youth. This cult made them do things… to each other. It was freaky cause they were around 10 at the time. The thing about it, they had an argument before hand, the reason why the got caught was cause they went forward with a dare/ mission. Something to prove their abilities to everyone else. There was a chance to turn back, but they didn’t- cause no one told them they could have. As they fell deeper and deeper into their trouble, it eventually led to their capture. Eventually they escaped, but this was when one of them went mad and killed one of the cultists. All chaos broke loose. They escaped into a ship and didn’t look back. They were picked up and no one knew where they came from.   They kept it all secret, but the guy who complained or the guy who wanted to turn back got personal. He hated that they did not turn back and began to like being where he was. You can say he accepted the cult as being the first to lose hope. When they escaped and killed the cult leader (and the whole cult in a small mob) he swore revenge. He was the guy who invited everyone to this island and the one who has been embittered by the groups atrocities.   Anyway, when they all found out. The guy wasn’t there. We ran for it. Unfortunately our ride and communications were all cut. He knew the island better and though himself empowered by the cult. He began murdering everyone. Leaving me and my brothers alone since we had nothing to do with it.   I slept 10 hours today. But it was a deep, deep sleep.

      So I have an Idea for characters.   Mel has these two character I will draw, but I like drawing our characters or ourselves as characters a lot. I guess anybody can figure that I am obsessed with being a character in one of my own games. I can’t help it, I can really feel ALIVE in the game. Despite the fact that is just make-believe and  there are better things out there then getting lost in fantasy.   When I make characters based on us brothers I have the pattern to put me as a defensive character whose unusual set of skills are useful pretty often. I make mel the prodigy (when its up to me to design his character- like gurps), the character who is the unusually good at what matters in the setting, and gaspar is the stable and grounded character whose concerns and abilities are simple and strait forward.   I recently cheesed their characters. I found an advantage that allowed gaspar to boost strength by targeting his upperbody (which makes him look like what he should- he world class body builder who can lift 510lbs boulder over his head or swing a 20lb double (A Philippine weapon wielded by mountain folk)axe-scythe. Of course dressed in heavy armor (heavy plate).   Me and Mel love using paired longswords since we practice arnis and appreciate the difficulty and the finesse needed to master paired sword fighting. –Which is not just Hack once with one sword, Hack twice with two. Since these are weapons of equal length one should learn to move in flow that allows the blades to compliment each other and never be in each other’s way. As a weapon that creates a threat range (which a shield can) it takes a different approach in combat psychology to use it as a defense (to keep the opponent’s wary of it’s striking range) as you move to striking range. I can go on and on so I’ll just end it with… its hard but its worth it. Two blades means I can fight with flexibly something one must be in every life threatening situation (just don’t break).  Jasper Favors Polearms which are used artfully as Staves as well. Think of how a monk would use his marital art staff but make it an AJAX of a monk who has scything axe-like blades in each end of his staff. Finesse and strength used in such art.   Of course we always have a story why gaspar is bigger. In fantasy settings he won a contest against a giant on took it’s strength as his spoils. In the modern setting he just took performance enhancers (a legal and safe dose) and in Sci-fi he usually is a cyborg.

      Welcome home chatty :)   SOCCER in a cool breeze  Soccer today was great. My leadership kept the score 1-2 leading in the first half. Unfortunately morale wasn’t so good for our lead players. Some of the guys didn’t have it in them to win. I wish they took advantage of my accurate lobs. I don’t know why they did not repeat what we did before ( I lobed it over defense and Tim just ran past and scored a goal, it was effective simply because of the accuracy of the pass). It was so simple. If they thought it may not work the second time around… they should remember that we had a captain… me, playing with tactics meant we adapt and they can’t. which means I could pull the trick 2 more times till they get the wiser. They should trust me more. I was holding the rear so that they could goal. Leadership is always giving the glory to the team.   The young ones like strength and speed. I admire that, but I’m the type to use my head more often in physically intense situations. My goal was a “trick” shot slipping it beneath the goalie when his weight was forward when he charged to get the ball. The ball was using it previous momentum and slipped right in. PURE FINESSE!!! I firmly believe that I have a 13+ DX… I think I just have a higher tactics score maybe.   The young ones are good, but I play with P700 equipment and got back on the horse after being of it for 5 years. Not bad for an old geazer. I got inspired by “the Rookie” with Denis Quaid- “As you grow old arms supposed to get weaker” was a line in the movie. Here, as I got old my brains is what makes my bronze better than it should be.   I notice that people can juggle the ball and put a lot of effort being able to do the trick. While people learn that trick I slam the ball to the ground and learn to stomp it to a stop, or work on my accuracy (I’ve gotten pretty good, I’m working on spins and at a 45 range). I also have a consistent nick up (where I just hit it light enough at an angle it goes up to an almost vertical direction) which is great for passing in small spaces.   Despite Cam’s and JP’s low ability scores relative to the bigger and more experienced players they can be match up with them. Pressure means distract or agitate so that the opponent will make a mistake. With a wing man (jP to cams and vice versa) you can easily take a ball from anybody (good or great soccer players). That’s tactics.   I love the HUMIDITY! Its 94% here and it feels like i’m drinking water as I breathe. I just love it. I can run farther and faster. Everyone took a water break before me. I usually am the first to go for water during the heat NOW he hehe.    Tactics- While your body is moving… make your brain move to. I love how tactics and strategy can change the game’s direction. MORALE is important to. I have a high morale even at the face of 8-3 score in the end. I just wish everyone else felt the same. It seems they don’t know how debilitating it is to have poor morale.  I watch soccer games on the TV, and they panic and make mistakes when they are desperate.   We only lost to morale… I should praise the other team but when there was not as much TEAM WORK as what we had in ours… I don’t consider it a real effort. Give me a gauntlet (a bunch of blockers) I can bring the ball through them solo at an insanely taxing effort or pass it with almost no effort.   I guess I should give them something to have a high morale about. I should play striker more often now. Goals appeal to them more than my words… and giving them these goals at the sacrifice in defense may make them consider that Catching up is not a far fetched idea.    MASS  well lola nudged me to stop writing in my journal. I can’t help it, I was so bored. My brain was playing little scenes of swordsmanship and characters I designed. I was conceiving all these cool ideas. I wish I had a chance to max out. I guess I will spend time in nature or someplace serene and think about things like I do in mass. One thing it taught me is the space to think is always important if you’re the type to get yourself into work you may not need.

      Its really cold in candy’s room. Well things will get colder in the states. I am thinking to much about RPGs. I feel like I don’t want to see a single RPG again. So what can I think about when its not about RPGs…  Relationships? Work? My general performance in life?…   I wish I can think about RPGs.   Chat Chat Chat…  Well, now. What can I say that would be appropriate here. Hmmmm… nothing till you get back and we see each other again. I’ll just say I’m glad I didn’t screw you up dating with me. I may not have the best track record… and when we first started talking we got into fighting. You know what, I liked it that we fought. Weird enough that I say it and like it but, at least when we argue we were trying to be honest and in the end we see each other more clearly for it.   Anyhow I’ll be off to mass in a few minutes. In this cold my fingers can’t move much and can’t feel much. I can see the horizon lighting up and I hope there will be enough daylight or cloudiness that I can play soccer. Even if it will be solo. I’ll play at around 2:30 since it gets dark earlier with all the clouds.   Had a discussion with Mel. We are going to make a comic. I’ll transcribe his campaign setting as best I could as I look for a job. I’ll start with baby steps. One page per week. Then work my way to one per day.

      done cooking... i made sinangag... garlic rice and cut up chorizo filipino with a perfectly fried egg. I think I’m ready for the next part of living independently… NOT HAVING ANYBODY NAG YOU!!!  Dad had a son to father talk about how mom is nagging more often. I’m not blind to see that she is afraid for us and stressed out. But isn’t what she doing why we stopped hanging around Gelo. I mean, sure I’m you son but you don’t have to be an ass about my imperfections. My sensitivity to nagging stops me from being able to work creatively since I get to worked up and mad to THINK CREATIVELY.  I’m glad that I’m not running a game today.  Learning the Mass Combat System of GURPS was a doosey. Of Course, the biggest room is the room for improvement (Mr. Antonio would say- South Ridge Principal who was never smiling. His attitude and grim determination promoted him to teaching in japan).   Basically I fixed it that Troup Strength, Strategy (which includes terrain and) and Leadership (the Heroes or Leaders more exactly). Are the parts of the battle that make the success or failure.   Troop Strength: The measure of Army Strength. The value can go to the Hundreds to thousands. I wish there a was a way that the system can break down everything to cards.   Battle Score: The skirmishing value of the character. It is a number of factors that tie him or her in to surviving in the thick of engagements. In the GURPS old system it is the average of Tactics and Battle. This score also determines if the character can put himself in more danger to achieve a heroic opportunity. Just like in L5R and all cinematic battles.   Strategy: It is a simple ability of maximizing what you have. It is a contest of Strategy. After tallying random events (Catastrophes), Terrain  and Preparations, and of Course heroic actions or tragic actions… this will modify the General’s strategy roll… which is a contest of skills. The winner and the degree he wins by determines how much less he takes in losses and how the morale of the losers army ends. This roll is every 30 minutes of fighting or hour depending n how much gets done.   Like a miniatures game on a table… or better yet a card game. I should make it easier to visualize by making a certain lay out for the armies. Like a 3x5 inch index card is this many troops, and the bigger card means more, the smaller card is less. Then there are the little cardboard cutouts that stand… printed stats for every little figure if we boil it all down to mass combat.   The normal GURPS rules figure during engagements.   Its even perfect since the rules are for second to second actions.

      I did it I edited 3 pages worth of rules… of course out of habit these rules are double column, single spaced, size 8 times new roman, with no breaks for paragraphs.   It must have been the equivalent of 30 page thesis. YEACH!!!  Anyway I’ll play soccer tomorrow, not before I drop off jasper’s thesis. Then I will go around hardware stores looking for putty. I have to fix this sculpture for mom. I guess I am a bit irritable about that.   Anyway…    GURPS GAME  I wish the guys cancel on me. I can’t make a gurps game. Not now. I wish I could get a job at Steve Jackson Games typing up character types and maxing them out. I have a knack for making them end in round numbers.   I would like that very much… writing for GURPS. I could make characters at 25 points and above and put several easy to calculate templates. I also would not mind doing any editing work for my own.   DND Well the Game is on Wed. Which is good, it means I will have a soccer game before I leave for the states.    My Doom/ Savior  Looking back at what kind of life I have. I have met a lot of amazing people, done some surprising things with what I had and failed miserably at the standards society expects of me.    I can’t judge myself. The way I learn to reserve my judgment despite my strong impulses. If I think I’m a loser not having finished college and prioritized my greencard was an unusual action to take.   I failed grade two when I was little. I was always a year older then the other kids and I guess to the people my age less mature. I caught up in college, big time. Its just that professionally I got stunted given the series of events that led to my failure.   Don’t get me wrong. I have an LOA slip and I can finish in 2 terms. I just have to finish by 2006. But I can’t. Simple as that. I have to get my green card. I’m twenty five and I could apply for citizenship at 30.   That’s too old to live the way I want to live. If I do keep up my health with my martial arts and soccer. How about my professional abilities. I wish I could get a job around illustration. Its hard to be an artist who is poor in this day and age. The computer is a great help for a guy who knows his limits.   With a computer I work with a +2 bonus. With a studio I work with another +2 bonus. At my skill level that would be 16. That would make me a professional.   But I need to earn the computer, the studio and the personal space to work… little by little. I have to find the contacs. I have to build a portfolio with the crap I got.   I might sound spoiled. But I know my potential… its just that AGAIN I hate asking for the capital. I like building everything from the ground up.   I guess I could use some confidence in my abilities. The 1865 poster was good: For a dinosaur and it took me 2 days and EVERYTHING about the drawing was made or scrounged up by me. No copy right infringement there. I know people download stuff and get stuff easy cause the have everything already. BUT I did it from nothing. UNFORTUNATELY this credit goes unnoticed. I like making everything orig and not using an established pattern. I have a vision in my head but I have no cash… and mom breathing down my neck. I can beat a deadline just as well as the other artist… ITS JUST MOM KEEPS BUGGING ME AND I GET TURNED OFF!!!  She complains…and complains and complains… DOES SHE THINK COMPLAINING WILL MAKE GOLD SHINE BRIGHTER OR SILVER NEVER TARNISH!!! OH FUCK,  I know I have odd hours. I lie on my bed at 6, sleep at 7 only to be bugged by mom before she goes to the gym, then I take another hour to try to sleep. Alcohol does nothing to me these days. I can drive with a glass of vodka in me. If I keep taking alcohol I can see my tolerance get used to it too quickly.  I wake up at 10 when dad says something or people moving around the room, then I hear my alarm ring at 12, I reset it to 1 and then I wake up with only 2 sets of 2 hours of broken sleep.   Everytime I close my eyes in bed I hear myself give myself a sermon, I hear mom’s sermon and have an hours worth of monologue going through my head when I want to SCREAM MY SELF TO SLEEP.   I sometimes imagine myself falling from the condo’s 44th floor as the rain would fall right beside me. I could see it form round clear drops and see makati… the rest of the world in one perfect instant… where imperfection is thrown out of my mind and what is left is bliss. Then the feeling of swallowing my teeth and how my tongue would taste the hard concrete. How my eyes would pop from the impact as the rest of my skull would pin my vision into the wet and cold dirt. How my legs and arms… my hands the muscles I work so hard to strengthen and refines bleed as my bones splinter into them. How places in my arm where pain cannot be felt and pain everywhere would throw my mind into a peace that would be the only last and everlasting kind.   FUCK!!! I hate talking like this. I hate going through the motions of writing something that could be more but I do not have the expertise to sculpt and refine. I hate the fact that when I was in highschool I made one short story about love that the teacher praised and everyone wanted to read… and how it reads like crap now.   I hate it when I dream and reality is so brutal that life can never be simple unless is imperfect. I hate how I want something taboo and I hate it cause it is an era that cannot accept it. FUCK again  Anyways… I’m making a character… so pure that he’s twisted. He feels and loves so purely that there is a catch. He is an honest, kind and very appealing soul. He hides it very well being blind and being mistaken as a handicap. Despite his exotic capabilities. He is an artist of people, a master sculpter and mind reader. Not with supernatural means but simply cause he has memory that is too great for him to control.   The character tore his own eyes out when he was a teen when he could not stop but keep memorizing every little detail in the most extreme sense. He had eyes that were too keen and a face so beautiful it tormented him… WHY…   I guess that’s for me to begin to explain… he has a lost love… a woman who died in front of him. He was a teenager and when his emotion were to strong to wrestle with he let go and embraced them unfortunately as you go from child to adult and you care memories of that precision everything begins to unravel. As you learn the patterns, the meanings behind the actions, and how everything is connected, his conclusion was to terrifying that he would block his own thoughts and begin to space out.   If doesn’t help to be in a family of prestige and complex relationships and hierarchies (the messed up families of those who indulge in all their pleasures).   Well, the character learned to act the manner of abstinence and moderation… unfortunately his lost love gave him a very interesting attraction to women his age (at that time) so you got a sick and twisted mind trying to find refuge where there is none to find…   Fucked up but I lik’ey

       Damn I have gurps in the Brain…   I was wondering why an average human with a sword has a 50% a man standing still (no defensive actions) in gurps.  DX10; Average Skill -5(unskilled); +1 close combat; +4 full attack  Total: Roll 3 six sided dice below or equal to 10  I guess its OK cause in D20… an average unskilled human has a 75% of hitting the same target.   So what gives with this odds. BAB+0; Unproficient Penalty-4; Standing completely still (AC5); Wreckless(charge) Attack +2, unaware +2;  Total: Roll a 20 sided die Rolling higher or equal to 5.    First of all… In GURPS every round is a second while in D20 its 6 seconds. Now at one second with out anybody telling you anything, lets say some surprised you with a line. “HIT THAT PSYCHO WITH THE CLUB” Even if the psycho did not see that baseball bat at arms reach and had not time to react do you think you would have hit the psycho?  I guess not. And that’s just a second. So in six seconds would you be able to hit A Pscho standing completely still as he/she stand there not noticing you as it looks to kill you for no apparent reason. Adrenalin and Circumstance will certainly give you the advantage. I guess that is a +5 to hit if you were given a couple of seconds ( no more than 6, lets say a +1 bonus to aim for every second he spent preparing, with the exception of the first second stumbling into the opponent) to compose yourself and all. Now you have a 99% of success.    OK now my conscience is settled…   Soccer  I scored a goal I didn’t think I could! It was about to rain as the winds picked up and the time was a minute to six. It was 3 all in a half court game with small ground ball goals a foot and a half high and three feet wide.  Scoring was only made when the other team failed to provide a defense against a counter attack. Since the goals were so small, a person standing infront would not give any space for the ball to enter so it was a tactical puzzle as well as one of ability.  I had the ball and the defense had already settled into postion: 1 man, JC. Chip was on his way to support him but did not hurry cause it was to difficult a shot. I thought the same to. It was an imposiblity that kinda gave me courage to try something new. I brought the ball up and made a simple feint, bring what should be my kicking leg over the ball missing it as my weight feigned the direction of my shot, my left leg just tipped it forward at the same time… the same motion one would make before he would find himself sprawling head first into the dirt.  It was a playful attempt. We had 6 attempts in 10 minutes… crosses which was my favorite tactic. But failed cause it is to easy to read given that it took more time to aim for such a small goal.   I was just so ecstatic cause before I made the goal there was an omen. The wind carried the clouds which flew so low scraping against the lower atmosphere similar to the view of a crushing wave as you are looking up from the bottom of the sea. You can almost see the difference in the air humidity that prevented the clouds from going any lower. I felt the rain give me power, like it always did when we played soccer in rainy days in highschool.   I remember how painfully hot my shoes would be from a soccer game during hot days. And how my asthma would suddenly clog a passage beneath my through and I would black out almost every heartfelt game of soccer.   The rain was like a friend to me when I played soccer. On a good field it would not flood. On a good field while it rained I could run twice as long as I would normally. I remember how it was to run for the ball and steal it from people who thought 15 feet is a safe distance from me. I used to run 100m in 12 seconds when I was 2nd year, that’s 2 seconds away from Philippines athletes I timed when I saw them train. I know run faster in soccer cause I am always trying to outrun the opponent’s reaction time.     Soccer Overview  I better teach cams to be more aggressive so that she wont be mistaken as helpless in the game. I can show her that guys immediately are careful around her… not that it is a bad thing but she can take advantage of it to keep ball possession. She has gotten better already but the guys and me are still too big to beat through skill alone.   There was this girl Joanna and she reminded me too much of Jimmy Colt (as pat would say) it just that her facial features and voice frighteningly reminds me of him… and she has a sharp ending nose (like jodie foster but just the end… she has a normal bridge)… which has to be Caucasian… despite her obviously Chinese face. I thought it was a plastic surgery (given that I watch ETC’s nip and tuck) but she would not be playing soccer if it was such.    Well I guess I am pretty much respected as a good attacker these days. I mean, the last time people had the confidence to let me attack I did not let them down by making good crosses. I also stop aerials better now allowing me to pass or attack quickly. My fundamentals are good and my accuracy has improved to 60% percent (skill 12 in gurps). My passing is 80% (skill 13 in gurps), and my control would be around 90% (skill 14). That would make an average of 13… and at this many hours playing I must have 200 hours on soccer (give or take lack of excersize at various points of my life) Hey that would give me a dex of 14!! But I guess its around 13, a +1 cause it is my favorite sport.  13 is a great stat for GURPS… Score 11-12 will be noticeable in a group of average people while a 14-15 would stick out. 13 is right before sticking out.   My Stats in gurps is I guess ST9 DX13 IQ13 HT11(in the habit of exercise).     Dilemma  Soccer is even great while it is hot cause I never burn as much calories in a shorter amount of time. Rain just means I play longer to burn as much. Recently as school started for a bunch of people I find myself with less and less people to play with. And I can feel so flab returning… Not that I am that sensitive but I don’t feel as confident since I don’t play as much.

      I am tired and I failed to reach my quota of 2 drawings a day. I have to settle for 1. But 1 good one. So Its again almost five in the morning and I have to wake up at nine. No Problem.   The drawing. Its hard to fix drawings given that I have no computer to make the precision adjustments I usually make in photo shop. I usually check for symmetry by mirroring the image and then open a file of a face with the same angle and look for any flaw or perspective mistake.   Funny I was able to talk to Chat on YM this morning. I didn’t know anyone was up at this time. Anyhow this is how my day will go… today. How my day went: 3:45am talking to chat at YM.  4:30 fixing downloads then going to sleep 10:00 waking up and scooting over to viramall bought 11 disks, 10 chu chow chili, and squadron was closed and did not open even at 11.  1:00 went back home and slept. 6:00pm woke up and moved around fixing stuff.  7:30pm left to pick Ton2 up and drop him home. 11:30pm left Ton2 place to go home 12:00Am left for Tita Su 1:00am watched Big Fish while drawing 4:30am waited for fraiser while drawing 5:09 finding my self still typing 6:00 am would be asleep by then (takes me 1 to 2 hours to fall asleep)  Plans for tomorrow. 10:30 go mr. Quickie to get my shoes 11:00  leave for Green Hills to buy pasalubong for job and jas… namely the DVDs they were asking for.  12:30 go to Glorieta to get tickets for troy 1:00pm eat lunch then go to sleep. 3:00pm wake up and get ready for soccer. 5:20 end soccer so that I will be ready  6:30 pick Chat up and proceed to Glorieta for Troy and dinner (on the run)   Made a CR5 Choker that can take on a party with interesting Concequences. Tactic: Stalk in upper tree tops (move 10), pick off party member who is far behind when no one is looking (Spot DC22), In one round he can grapple(+20), pin and drag him or her away quietly to slaughter. With two standard actions he can hold a pin and choke the subject to unconsciousness (holding the subject down for subject’s constitution score in rounds then at unconscious coup de grace).

      I slept at 9 woke up at three. I don’t know why but I feel like I was trained in the army given that I am always awake at odd hours working and learning to sleep when I can. The difference is that I am not pushed to exhaustion.   I went to the sixth floor where the pool and all the amenities were. Some foreign chicks were there, but I ignored them and went to one of the long resting chairs and found myself falling asleep in comforting thoughts. although i wish i was not to lazy to socialize.  Lola was sewing, Mom was watching TV and I was aching to get something done. I guess I’m the type that needs a lot of space.   I notice where my odd hours come from. I can’t draw during the day because there is so many people out there and its just bustling with other things to do. Space is luxury and I guess I need it to draw. I have dug up all the stuff I have to return by tomorrow.  Ton2 called me up cause he needs someone to drive him home to alabang at any cost. No problem I told him. It’s not like he hadn’t done a lot for me already. So this little thing is my gift. I’m learning to sleep less. I have brought my habit down to 6 hours. From a 10 hour sleeper to a 6 hour one. I guess the trick is to dream when your awake. Now that I’m infatuated I tend not to sleep as much. I remember a time when I went with just 6 hours… the time I had my first GF. Why dream when all your dreams are there at your waking hours.   I guess if you live your dreams then only you body needs rest and your mind doesn’t need to dream much to motivate you anymore. I am the type to always wait for that special dream to inspire me. Now that I’m like this I wonder how to balance it all out. If I work to hard, I’ll sleep to long, to little and I’m awake at odd hours like this one. I slept at 9 and up at three that’s six hours… I plan to keep awake till 9 and I’ll bring my drawing materials to the sixth floor where I can maybe soak the peace and quiet.   One more week till I leave. I have to return some stuff and get them back. I lent Gino some of my gaming stuff so that he knows what it is all about. I’ll get that back. Arj wants to run a game… I want to run a game but I can’t spend time to prepare it. I have my packing to worry about.    THINGS TO BUY FOR THE STATES  - Padded Sticks - Chu Chow Chili - Bunch of CDs to burn my accumulated data (I need a longer list can anybody suggest?)  I’ll be going to Virra Mall in 5 hours to buy the stuff above. I’m planning to draw while waiting… Alison Lohaman is still in my head. I can draw her face from memory now. That’s pretty cool, I like the feeling when the face you yearn for is a couple so scribbles away.

      Confused and Feeling Uneasy I’m trying to center myself given my strange and lax condition. Ever since I’ve been pushing my self in soccer harder and doing so much better in the sport my legs jerk and kick when I’m trying to relax. I Can feel them wanting to kick, run, dodge, weave and cross. Its pretty cool for me cause it takes little for my legs to warm up and let go full sprint these days.  I have such a silly infatuation which I can’t let go of cause its giving me ideas. I mean I’m writing story outlines and thinking up cool scenarios. I wish my visual sense can start cooperating with my creative senses for a drawing. I can’t think of  what to draw since I don’t have a mirror to help me with perspective and a printer to print out the pictures of my muses.  To relax I made GURPS legal characters at 100pts which I hope to play someday.  Laptops I have music from hans Zimmerman and Jerry Goldfield and they have great combat and gaming music. I wish I figured this out sooner. With this laptop I have enough materials to run a game. I wish I can save up for one when I get a job. I can certainly use one to make my works with. I just need a scanner and a work table and I would be set.  I love moving around with the laptop. I would love running games with it and writing given that I am used to it now. The mobility would allow me to make full use of my spare time.   I’m trying to learn a bit of web these days. Enough for my own website. Reading something positive RK’s work load its pretty cool to be as busy as he is. You eventually accumulate a lot of finished works and after a point you can develop other things with such a collection.    Sorcerers (how would I justify the class) -They gain meta magic Feats or spell focus every: 5 levels with one at level and have eschew materials (or a free feat) at level 1.  - Discount their meta magic use by one level (without a minimum of one) so they can easily extend spells and use silenced, still spell immediately. Which is cool cause it would be fun to put some armor on them and make them show everybody that some arcane spellcasters can kick but.  Problem: This may be too powerful compared to the wizard… But it makes more sense to me.   -Oh yeah and fuck the familiar... when you can do this crap it doesnt fit anymore

       White Oleander  I watched white oleander, just because of alsion lohman. Ok I don’t know if the movie was good cause I liked her but I really liked how it was made and played out. I wish my bro could get a chick like her. I mean reading her bio… she would be his type. Its like him… a prodigy and one who made it all her own.   Its funny how it got me thinking and how my art was influenced. I know that the artist was someone else but the artist was roughly my age or alison’s age. I want to say I draw as well but don’t find the time to.   I think I will take my sweet time before I get a job. Relearn my art and make stuff. I’m working on several images right now that I have a personal and intimate connection to. The only time I draw like that is when I am in love BUT my current crush is un-attainable so I don’t know where it is coming from.   Loneliness is the Human Condition… well if you are not strong… Not that I am. What the fuck am I calling myself that in the firstplace. Its just that its my business and I guard against giving into to it.    Thoughts   I wish I got my act together sooner. I wish I quit school earlier and became an artist. I wish I was a father at 18… I don’t care if I didn’t have a wife or mother for the kid… I want to devout my existence away from my self cause I was just so used to it back at high school. When you forget yourself in helping others is the best escape… like sex you fulfill an instinct that ensures the survival of the species.   But I must be destined for greater things if I did not fall into that niche. Its harder to do whats painfully right and what may seem so wrong but is the truth you desperately need.   My age scares me… I should have accomplished something by now. But I wont be able to. It’s ok, not like I’m genetic material to be continued into the next generation. But the way I know I will roll a 20 I know I am going to kick ass… I might be Justinian’s age by that time that happens. Though… or maybe I’m kicking ass now but don’t know it.   Unknownst to RJ I had a huge crush on marga tuazon. Not that I could escape from being paralyzing shy at the time or I lived in san juan so I can’t meet people who all lived in alabang. I got over her, and the girls like her. I guess growing up meant that it was an illusion… everything I felt despite how pure and true it might have seemed. But doesn’t that discount that I could feel real love or inspiration.   I was watching a movie on the laptop on the way to pick up henry, Dangerous!? Heck yeah! But I told myself, watched when you find yourself staring into halted traffic and listen for the cars. It worked.    Survival Instinct  It might be sudden but I realized that those who survive battles aren’t great fighters because they lucky enough to live that long but because they can wrest control of the situation. An instinct that arrives from hardship. I think I have it… or what would become it… Knowing this puts me at my fantasy about swords and living on the edge of combat. Its that aggressive intinct that you cannot die… not just yet. When life and death comes up the only thought that goes through my mind is that I don’t want to be remembered this way.   Tomorrow I should be awake by 8:00 to drop off my shoes at mr quicky. I hope I wake up in time… then I plan to go to sleep after getting home and breakfast.    Soccer  I kicked ass in soccer. Tactically I was the bomb. I knew how to predict the movement and defend with the least effort 7 out of 10 stars (he he). I made the sweetest cross, the cross went between the legs of two defenders at full running speed with only my peripheral vision and the goal was just too easy. I’m playing tomorrow. Too bad I can’t see nikki for soccer. Maybe I’ll just ask her… that wouldn’t be so hard. A first date.   PEEVE  Chez wrote to me apologizing for not replying and giving me an escuse that her comp was being formatted. Funny, cause she uses the schools computers. I know when I’m not wanted… she could have contacted me by phone since I gave her my number or rented a computer. I assume she realize what she was getting into and bailed out. I wish i never asked her out, how embarassing. Here i celebrated for nothing.   Sheesh I’m not some baby or some helpless dolt- rejection is nothing to me. If she wanted to tell me that shes busy she did not need to make an elaborate excuse. I was a student to a great observer and I know when shit is flung at me. I’m just irritated how sometimes my defenses eventually brake down and try to see if they changed or will be more open minded. FAT lot that kind of optimism does.   I’ve gotten to a point that I’m almost bulletproof. It was always in my prayers before that I grow this hide and it did come true (actually everything I prayed for came true). I’m there person to be with if your heart is broken cause I would know the cure… a lot of fun and my inspiring words. Yes 2 witnesses to this unusual ability was RJ and Ton2. I don’t know why but I have that kind of gift… not that it gets girls or something to make money out off but I guess it was imparted to me because of all the effort people there who gave to be there for me when I was so down. Like the way magical abilities were acquired in shanara, after a lot of exposure and sacrifice I gained this. Cool, now I wish I had a twin to be able to share the power and make it go back and forth.           If in know I’m not wanted I just stop contact. That simple, it was like that with chez, with joy, and with grace. I just disappeared, a magic trick I learned from confronting fred and learning the ulterior motives of JV, Adrian, Nabs, and Tommy (and their ilk, thanks pat). Cut all communications and act like nothing happened. That way I can maintain some civility when I do see them… act plastic by acting glad and starting flattering conversation then leaving with no means to contact.   I guess that is mean… but I can take it from some people than I’m sure as hell they can take it from me.     Peeve #2  I hate it when women don’t eat on dates (like in something gotta give). A healthy appetite is not a turn off. Sorry **** its just a peeve, It makes me conscious of how much I’m eating… that’s why I paid most of the bill…  but its no biggie. I mean your on a diet and I respect that, I just wish there was another way for me to eat like a horse (cause like a pig would mean I’m out of shape) and a date to eat as little as she can. I’m a hedonistic shit. Life is too short for pain in suffering when I’m supposed to be having the time of my life.    I’m Drawing again  I realized my talent is simply my mind. I’m an artist because of it simply cause I chose it as a path. I also realized if I applied my self in another field I won’t have the freedom I need to be able to reach more people with what I can do.      Stories (just personal notes for my setting and jabber jabber jabber)  I have a portrait of the emperor in full armor, wounded in battle kneeling by his dead Empress Elana. In the scene she had died and shriveled away and in her arms she carries a baby. She was kidnapped a year and a half ago along with his son (not of her’s). She died on a hay bed as she let the two children lie with her. The emperor is down on his knees holder her hand.   The emperor came into power because of her… like joan of arc she was a peasant girl who had a power to win the battles for her king. Her loyal body guard was the  emperor-to-be acquired the position out of popularity and had no real talent except to be terribly polite, nice and friendly. Other warriors considered him a wuss but he got better as their criticism fell on his ears and the Elana was captured with him.   He was a popular figure and had a son at 18 who he was a very good father to (put in 100% every time he was there- he was more patient and understanding with kids than adults). When the king failed to rescue them he brought her back his friend’s help and they lead a coup and he won the throne by default (being the lesser evil). He married the joan of arc and ruled as king and queen even as times were turbulent. She was kidnapped a week later along with his son who she adopted as her own.   After she died the emperor became extremely vengeful and bitter. He then began exploiting the advantages he once found too “evil” to use. He created a secret police (which later on his son: the nameless or xon would lead at 18), he freed the undead lord Crinnian and bound their fates intertwined so he cannot betray him. He then used all his politics to crush all bordering nations and let all the wealth, opportunity and education fall into the hands of his empire… then naming it after his deceased wife.     He has two sons, itself a story of its own. One is his father’s will (the first one and having been old enough to know Elana over his Ramwren and full well what his father fights for) and the second son named Ramwren who is a prince of high ideals and tragedy as the emperor named him his heir (even when he is not of blood but because he was Elana’s blood) and all the concubines (all powerfull ladies who are regents of each realm the emperor has conquered) try to use assassins and spies to kill him or destroy his chances of ascending. His older brother (who appears to him as an brotherly servant of his father named Allen) teaches him his craft (being a master manipulator).   Ramwren was half raised by his uncle the emperor’s brother and spiritual and martial leader of the empire (the emperor killed the pope and put his brother in his place who happened to be a general of his army… he made the church of the defender… aimed to protect the people and ensure freedom “we are here to ensure the freedom of our people at the cost of our own” a super elite military order of knights ironically called the Blackgaurds). So he has the honesty and integrity of his uncle (who hated the idea of pope at first embraced the role as his power to protect and defend greatened with it).   In this empire the secret police is the most powerful force that protects it. Adventurers are it’s agents (they go places, approach and solve problems and risk it all for ideals-the loyal agents and sometimes money-the pawns)   The realm’s greatest assassin is dynare an Anari (like elves crossed with junkies-depressed and wired in a way no one understands them). There is an urden (spirit and appearance of dwarves and genius of gnomes) who calls himself Moradin God of the Urden. There are wanderer warriors called the Vald (shanara’s rovers and scots to get the idea, but with a curse they turn to Horren(orc-lke brutes) if they fall below their warrior’s: that’s why they almost never live long enough to get old).

       I wish i could sleep!!!  Ok I slept at 12 and woke up at 3… that’s bad. Yesterday I slept at 6 woke up at 10… that’s two days of not dreaming… THAT’S VERY BAD. I guess that’s my kryptonite, if I can’t dream then what the fuck can I do with my self. I can’t draw if I can’t dream… there is no special something stirring inside me to find its way into paper.   Oh heck… I’ll take another half glass of cheep vodka… that’s the only thing that puts me to rest. There is some buko pie in the fridge ( I like buko pie) so that’s my breakfast.   I can sense a part of me that wants to sleep, but reality kills my fantasies. I’m tired cradling my thoughts with lies before I sleep… its gets old fast and I can’t keep lying without some kind of hope to keep it up.   I watched the Knockaround guys… It’s a good movie. I realized that fathers should take it easy with their sons. I also notice that fathers who pay more attention (no shortcuts… the hardway) and are easy on their son (when they are trying) is a good guideline. Its not fullproof but I have a better idea now.   Reality depresses me. I mean staying awake and not having an orginal, inspiring idea in my head tares the soul out of me. I’m planning to make a web comic as I promised pat. I just don’t know what layout to put. I plan it to be a website where job can post his ideas, rules, art and setting; while I try to make ends meet. I want to work creatively even if I might be cleaning toilets for a living.   Thankfully being Filipino I am more exposed to disease and I can get down and dirty with less worry. My cousin told me about his wifes weaker auto immune system… she can’t even eat mayo that has been out of the fridge for a day. While back here that’s type of sandwich made for company picnics prepared a whole day before.    Chat  Well thanks for the advice. I’ll try to use it if this other method I’m using sucks. Method to my madness, being the term.    Mel   Alsion Lohman is 5’2” ya know, too bad shes older than you. Hey I even heard the girl in devil’s panties is around 5’ so I guess you’ll meet ms. Right no matter how tall she is. Honestly, I like big girls to… even girls taller than me… its just that most of the girls who are that tall aren’t my type  Pat Hey I found THAT SONG by ROBERT PALMER ( I also got alot of his songs now) "know by now". I heard  it oncein my car at 1999 and never heard it again.    My Type?!?  When people say “not my type” what do they mean. Most of the time people mean “not pretty enough” –some guys say.  Well… I never put appearance as an issue (look at my track record he he he). I mean I know you can only get a someone equal to your charm or appearance. The degree you fall below the standard is how little effort you need.  If I were to have a type… I guess it would be someone who would Not run my confidence to the ground (like #1) or be more mature and listen to me… not spacing out into her phone when I’m saying something important (like #2) and… who isn’t into to me at all.   Ha got ya there… I realized its when a woman is not interested do I get interested. STUPID yes… but not entirely my fault. I guess it has all to do with timing. I realized from my past most recent mistakes is that I’d rather go for a girl who did not like me so that if things don’t work out (as I got to know her) easy out. I mean if she is just giving me an interview and thinking the longterm about me instead of liking me immediately (like in the US “finding him cute”) that’s easier to fix. Once you have committed to a feeling it’s hard to see things objectively.   I learned that liking a girl and letting it hang out is bad (no shit Sherlock!)… in the way it ruins what could be friendship. Its that “ilang” feeling women get as they are more cautious and guarded about what the guys motives are.   Whoah!!!  To complicated there… I’ve been a safe date always and as a sign of trust did a ton of other things to show it as well. People can roll their sense motives and see the truth and character like it was glass. Heck, I’m no JV or those other guys like him in Opus Dei.   Let me take a moment to wonder where this came from.   Oh yeah… my type. I guess bottom line is my type are the girls who aren’t interested and I’m not interested. If I can be a good friend to a girl without any ulterior motives then I guess she would be my type. But the conflict of that is a good thing.   I guess joy started thinking of me as her type when I walked into a conversation with her and wango. They were saying if they end up alone and at 30+ they needed someone to marry them. I said How about me, I’m sure wanggo would not have any problem (I didn’t know he was gay at that time). SO it was kind of an agreement then that who ever two people (being at opposite gender) were left they would marry as company.   … I think it was at that time did things start getting bumpy.   It has been four years and I still can’t believe It happened to an introverted geek like me. And by the way it all began simply because I wanted to help and make friends.

      It’s funny that Alison Lohman, the actress I have been musing for a bit happens to be my age and was a voice (not nausicaa herself) in “Nausicaa: valley of the winds” the most recent an accurate portrayal of the movie (2003). Funny thing was I thought she was around 15 cause she played a 14 year old girl just last year in matchstickmen.   Anyway, I’m here trying to learn web-shit while getting ready to leave for CSB to get jasper’s papers. I’m pretty spaced out cause I had half a glass of vodka to put me too sleep (I slept at 6 and woke up at 10) and I dreamed of Alison Lohman playing a real life version of Nausica only to discover she her movie credits in the internet include that?!? Coincidence or is it my unusual luck… anyway I put some pics here as an exercise to what I have learned so far.   My dream was pretty quick… it finished in time for me to tell myself to wake up and get my ass into gear. Thank god for alcohol or I would be an insomniac and thank god for juice for helping me push it down. I cant remember my dream, but half a glass didn’t give me a hang-over since I bloated myself with water trying to wash the taste of alcohol away.

       NAUSICAA  I watched nausicaa when I was around 10. I cried watching such a sad story but an inspiring ending… (I was ten after all). I still have to say that Hayao Miyazaki had chosen a medium that was perfect for his immortalization.   Its poignant tone and beautiful scenery helped make it such a world to be lost in. I was thinking I should use it to inspire me to write for the mood of the (my fantasy rpg) setting. Then there is the conflict of the story, rich with “realistic” villains and circumstances surrounding men at arms where I draw from “berserk”.  I guess that will be what my website would ideally be about. I promised pat that I would make a web comic. I will, but I don’t have any material yet. I guess not until you put me and jobert together… then you have a writer and an artist. Jasper being the guy who keeps us grounded (very important when the two of us get carried away with our fantasies).  At least when I go to the states, while I wait for a job I can draw. I just need a scanner. Mom says she will buy one for me. Then I’ll hook it up to tin’s computer (not before I fix it) and begin my works on my portfolio.  When I was a kid I always dreamed that I was this knight in a setting like the movie Nausicaa and she was a character mixed in with Joan of Arc. Like joan she was a hero from peasant beginnings. During the time she was held prisoner and her king abandoned her, my character rescued her… as the story goes on the king she instated was a false one… a misreading of the prophecy (I didn’t say it was a church thing nor was it the real joan of arc). I took his seat with my sword ( I was allied to the greatest heroes of the realm) and united all the kingdoms… and shit. Only for her to be kidnapped by the most diabolic villain and to rescue her after a year of searching as she lay dying with a child whose not mine.   I’ll modify the story a bit then I guess I can use it in my setting.          WEIRD DREAM  I dreamed of talking to mark almanzor. That could be possible in the near future cause he is in NY. I wouldn’t have anything interesting to tell him. I felt bad… cause I know the reality that I’m not as rich as my parents. I figure there is a good side to it anyway, I can be more involved with my family. I may not be rich in wealth, but rich in some other important things would be ok.   I hope to make my dream of becoming a comic artist working in the phils in the future. I want to live near tita su so I can eat their great bulalo, tapsilog and sisig till my dying day and still be close to fort where by then there will be a soccer field I can play in 3 times a week (since I work free lance in my own home).     VOTING  I voted for GMA. It’s the best I can do, so many of my CSB friends did not register to vote. It was kind of sad, cause if she does not get elected, the popular vote of the ignorant poor will win. This is a great example why a democracy would only work in certain cases.   I wish there was some mental standard for being a president. FPJ would have failed it. Heck I wish there was a mental standard for becoming a public servant so that dynasties of actors would not have such a grip on  the future.    BLOGS  Not bad for a guy who doesn’t know web design. I’m planning to add more pictures later ever since I learned how to use my friendster account as a url. But that would just be pictures of me. I should spend one whole day making my own website. I just wouldn’t know what to put in it given that my scanner is broken and all my art is unscanned and still in rough sketches.

       I HAVE NAUSICAA!!!!   I’ll run a game based on it. Any bites? I will also run a game on the line of  Berserk.  Well I’m here making gurps characters for the better part of 3 days. I just can’t help but be hooked on it ever since nico said he might run one. I’m using GURPS Fantasy to help me write and outline of the setting and I’ve been drawing inspiration from BERSERK*.  I’ve been pausing each episode after getting a cool idea and making the NPC based on it. I was also looking at the structure. I was thinking of using the GURPS mass combat system to simulate it… but its too complicated.   So far I have redrawn some of the drawings which were too dirty cause of the velum poster I have been using. You can’t erase well on velum, your arm is just getting muscled up with no progress.    Idle thoughts  My left arm has become more dexterous, as well as my leg. I can actually begin training with my left arm. I can’t use my right cause its too fragile and it needs it’s soft but accurate touch for drawing… my left is become brutish as I make it do most of the hard labor.  * One of my all time favorite anime, Berserk has a good story, lots of violence, low magic and allot of character. I would suggest it to anyone who like dark fantasy and gritty story lines. At first glance people  might think it cheesy but Berserk started the big sword trend during the early eighties. It was the first Ultra-big sword wielding hero and he did It with a lot of flare and grim presence. (ex. animes that ripped of the idea and did so bad was “rave”, saske of rorouni kenshin stopped using his sword after encountering the titled hero, and FF7 was way after Berserk was made)

      I finished my game with Majed and Paul. It was a better ending but I still rusted and I was clueless on how to end it given that they weren’t able to solve the mystery. They should have followed their gut instead of their rolls. Even if you fail to notice something your gut feelings still help you figure things out.   Anyway, I’m at home and it would be roughly lunch time for me at 10:00 pm. I will be drawing again. The part of my drawing where candy was supposed to be is to unrepeatable cause the vellum is too dirty and won’t let me erase the guide lines. Its annoying, vellum has a great texture with it being smooth and all but its stubborn as to not let the very light pencil marks come of. I feel like tearing the whole drawing in two.   Good News.    Adrian smith, artist of Warhammer, replied to my question!!!   hello justin.   im very sorry for taking so long to reply.   everything you mention reminds me of myself when i first started. i would often give up on a picture if i thought i had a better idea or got 'bored'. this is all a matter of 'discipline' my6 friend, boring answer i know but that is basically it. if you keep distracting yourself with what seem like better ideas half way through a picture then you'll just end up getting nowhere. the thing to do when starting out is not dive into an idea tats just too big. start maybe with a small scene or ewven a single figure or object. concentrate on finishing the piece to as near as what you originally 'planned' in the first place, dont overwork areas. if when finished you look at it and think you could of done something ext5ra on a certain point then atleast youve learnt something and you can even go back and try the same idea again but with this new knowledge...... theres only so much someone can teach you, the real answer is to draw and keep on drawing. 5to start with if youre anything like i was then 90% of wwhat you do will not be to your liking but youve got to realise what you are learning from all those 'mistakes' and try to correct them in future work.     right, sorry if i babbled there. hope its some help to you. just make sure you enjoy it and i wish you the best of luck in the futuire.   take care.   adrian.    It was what I needed. I mean I admire the guy’s style. I like it more than lokwood and I find his black and white art the type I aspire to make mine rise up to. I’m really happy he answered my question. It helps me focus and understand that there will always be hope as I work towards my goal. Even if it may look futile, my hard work will bring me there.   I thanked him and I’m going to be showing me gratitude by making him hear about me in the future. I’m almost there, I just get tired easily. I have to build up stamina drawing and bringing my mind into focus. Soccer helps me there. A Mind and Body thing going.

      I want to work on GURPS but I can’t wait for 4th ED. But I bet it won’t be that great… I just want a system that makes sense. I want to run Harkwood… an old GURPS adventure or any GURPS adventure. I like the fact the detail in gurps can surprise you.   I’ll be going out to do some exercise later. Some soccer drills in the park as I try to improved my ball control and tire myself out. I woke up 4:30 today so that kinda sucks. Maybe I should sleep early so that I can drive lola and lolo to mass on Sunday at 6AM.  I have to draw though… right now I’m mixed up cause I want to draw but it was too hot and I couldn’t control my strokes. My hand gets so heavy and un-dexterous. I think I should learn to build up drawing endurance.   Anyway this is something I found in my brother’s site.          you are violet  #EE82EE         Your dominant hues are red and blue. You're confident and like showing people new ideas. You play well with others and can be very influential if you want to be.  Your saturation level is lower than average - You don't stress out over things and don't understand people who do. Finishing projects may sometimes be a challenge, but you schedule time as you see fit and the important things all happen in the end, even if not everyone sees your grand master plan.  Your outlook on life is bright. You see good things in situations where others may not be able to, and it frustrates you to see them get down on everything.         urlLink the spacefem.com html color quiz

       Last CSB Game   Thanks to Arj, jed, nico and rick came to my place to finish the adventure I ran almost a year ago. I’m disappointed at how rusty and bad my GM has become. It takes so much mental energy that I had to ask mom for some of her home made max Brenner hot chocolate   Mom’s Chocolate   I have to congratulate mom for being able to get this close to the Max Brenner chocolate. She tells me a 2lbs. block costs her 40 pesos… plus the effort. She can sell the cup at only 80 and she would make a killing.  Mom and her friend Jack are planning to make a café. If they do then this will be their coup’de grace.   Soccer   Love it and getting better at it. Going to a game tomorrow… not much to expect.    Games   I’m studying this GURPS module. I love gurps, love it more than D20. Too bad, august is still so far away.

      Strange Dream:  It all began in the Reclaimed Area of Manila where there was this dark tower multi-purpose building. Me and my partner, this tall and familiar looking girl were at a comic convection. I was judge, despite that it was featuring manga which I was very critical with.   Well me and my partner (whose name escapes me) have been around the longest time. She was like my assistant the despite the fact that she earns more money than me and being better off. (an established piece of information in the dream.  It was a strange place as booths of various artists and manga publishers showcased their works and I critiqued them to almost a painful barrage. I felt very professional and important… then somehow these arrangements are all making sense. There were many fans, as it was both a family affair and a geeky one. Sometimes children get separated with their parents and I keep a good eye on them till someone unsuspicious looking picks them up (a real habit of mine).  My partner and I have a strange relationship, she is like Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock in “two weeks notice”. I was the popular artist and she was my successful and spazzed –out producer. She had this retard for a crush (I don’t know why? But I bet its true in some cases in the real world). We both stalked him into a massage parlor where there was a menu written: small (fixed amount), rounded or voluptuous (fixed amount), and tall (fixed amount). Special talents cost double of the fixed amount.   She wanted to look but I peeked a head of her and told her not to. She didn’t anyway and thought the image in her head may not be as bad so she left. I drove her home only to stop when news in the radio was talking about a litter girl abducted during the comic convention. I stopped and realized she could be this litter girl wandering around that I noticed.   I began to drive back, with my partner telling her what I noticed. As I got there the judging continued and some show off critics (artist wanabees but never cut it) were trying to dazzle the audience with confusing statement. I hated that and proceeded to talk in plain words to the audience where they drank my words and let it fill their heads. The Critics were pissed at me. While I did this my partner was looking through rooms and manage to climb up this dangerous height were some kids slid from breaking their legs. I climbed up with her and looked down at the scene.   It all came rushing to me: where I saw the girl, where she was picked up, and which is the shortest and direct rout for an escape outside, as well as why some of the stalls hid the exit and the floor plan was made out that it was easy for children to separate and some one can have their pick of the litter.   It bothered me why some one would intentionally do this. I met with the arrangers, some provincial businessmen and artists who share my inspiration. My detective ability was incredible for me… cause it was like a game and I was one of my favorite characters: a detective.     So we both left, trying to remember who was in charge of what. In my hurry I slid down, to the anger of the guards. The last few kids broke their legs. I used the tail ends of my polo to slow my decent. My assistant did the same… and so did so many other people after seeing me walk out of there alive and running to my car.  We began to drive. She made some calls and we found the house… but it was too obvious. It was  in a crowded area in salcedo and someone would have seen something. A person that crafty, having arranged the exhibit a certain way would have done similarly to cover his tracks. So I got a list of his properties and businesses. Living in the town for the longest time, It took my the whole bustling night to deduce it to this small out of the way apartment with private parking and sides street entrances. I went in by foot… so did my partner.   She came following me and when we got into the place, the door handle was out of shape that I could quietly twist it open despite the lock. We crept in, with floor boards creaking I told her to stay at the edges where the wall supports more of the floor to avoid the noise. We did so and found the girl tied up and the guy.  I pounced him and told my partner to get the girl out. They were running out when the door opened with 2 other men appeared and they pounced me. I hammered my fist at them feeling battered meat but it didn’t stop them from pinning me down. I wriggled free and ran, as an athlete I easily out ran an average people and so did I out run these guys, running into the streets and taking my partner with me in a public area where the police soon arrived.   The guy cursed at me and shouted. He said when he gets out he’ll kill me. I told him that won’t be till another 20 years by then I would have had a kid who can track him down and whupp his ass for another 20 more years. My partner looked at me funny, cause I had my arm around her snuggly and we were both so happy: resulting to the optimistic reply.   “I didn’t mean me and you!” looking at her obviously I didn’t know if I was lying to my self. She just laughed and we went home. I woke up and blabbed it all to candy who founding it odd as it made some sense for a dream… I did too.   More stuff happened in the dream. It was exploring my relationship with my partner. It was weird and confusing. But this was the gist of the scene. It was strange cause, all the clues were about design and psychology of how people reacted to it- something I was an expert of in the dream.

      Things Looking Dim  I should have quit school when nico did better yet when mom asked me to after La Salle.   Living with Tin is my worst nightmare come to life. Not only did I have to deal with my parents who have no faith in my abilities but a person who has no faith in me as a person. I don’t know why I have to live with her. I feel like I’d rather sink or swim. In this case, save up working GOD KNOWS where (stopping short of selling organs or whoring) just to save for my own apartment. WHILE MY ABILITY RUSTS!!!  I hate rusting. I play soccer 3x a week now just to stop from rusting. I hate what it does to me and now IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN!!!   What can I do to stop it.   1. I will not bring anything of sentiment with me to the states. I will pack my scanner, sketch board, cheap drawing supplies.  2. Finish my portfolio at all costs. Even if I have to skimp on promises to do other stuff. People will understand given that MY OLDER SISTER IS INVOLVED. 3. Learn to Draw 2 finished scetches a day. That would give me enough ability to apply for a comic artist position for paying a sum of 4,000 a month. Enough money to cover a small apartment in south jersey, where my siblings can live with me… and have a UNSTRESSFUL domestic life.    Long Term Plans… Either way, I will have to go back to the phils. Even if I may make it big in the states, COMICS doesn’t need me to be in the US to work. SO I’d rather take my 4,000 here. Learning from my mistakes and my parent’s own influence that is living with 200k a month. That’s not bad… infact that great. (this is the worse case senario… best case is earning as much as a B+ artist which is $20k a month or P1m a month)   Even on a worse case senario what could I need? (per month) Apartment in makati 40k Date Money 15k a Car Expenses (a car and van) 10k Soccer and Hobbies 10k Living Expenses 25k    That’s enough money saved up for me to plan for something.   Promises if I make it well to do  - Donate 10% of my income to a child shelter That would be 20k… that should be enough to do a lot of good per month.  - Start Teaching: As a part time in an all boy school. Look for Kids like me (who needed help) and help them reach their dreams. They can be my players and talents to be.   - Stop being bitter and grudging : yes, I will. As henry put it- “the old Justin back.” (although I hate to admit how it took me 10+ years to get over being mislead and heartbroken is rather slow… but a good indication of the character I was hoping to possess)  Hopefully I get this all done by the Age of Christ. If I get there then I’m doing something right… Looking at it… it’s a perfect blend of what my mom and dad is all about (fun and charity)

      Saw Tomz in MTV and that other girl in my class. I see a lot of people from CSB lately on mtv… I guess cause it is the forefront of Multimedia… where else would people whose talents are such play… I mean work.  Tomz is the girl who talks about being or living in the world as a fulfilled woman (or something… I wasn’t listening I was trying to see through the video static they put to make it look gritty)  Played soccer today with Camille and Ichiro. I was the only one from my gang but since the three of us were school mates we got along the best. Camille’s friends: nikki, april and jenny came to play with us.  We played three on three: Me, Nikki and Jenny and there were Ichiro, Camille and April. Unfortunately I scored 3 of the goals… on a end score 3-3. what made it bad was I was the proficient player and I should have given them the opportunity to score.   Art update   yes I'm drawing again but i tripping on ideas... I need a ton of them... i need a ton of art at my disposal (fantasy idealy)... hope to use all these new drawings for my portfolio   Drew my GURPS family... I'll show you guys when i'm done... jasper has reall bad ass armor its just that... (again) i'm running out of ideas and fuel... WHAT can I eat that would get my brain juices running sugar but not sugar?  A CUP OF DARK ITALIAN CHOCOLATE!!! or Bicolano Bitter Hot chocolate!!! BUT I CANNOT FIND ANY NICE BITTER ONES... ALL OF THE BRANDS ARE TOO SWEET!!!(thus made of more sugar than cocoa)   Rambling ( I should be drunk but I have no money for sweet wine)   Ok there was some attraction between me and Nikki, its just that I seem to be unable to do anything given that… well… I’m leaving.   I’m leaving on the 26th of may (it was rescheduled again).  I can have a maybe a short whirlwind… something. Not a fling and not a romance… its what it can possibly be… anything. And yes this is about the amount of forethought a typical guy would put If he were to draw a line… so that I do not expect to much and make anyone expect as much either.   I wanna go out, have fun, and maybe… go crazy with my emotions. I don’t want to hurt anyone or lead them on to something serious. I guess I’m looking for sweet nothings… small tokens of nothings to write about and keep it as a seed for my fantasies.  Thoughts to cradle me in.   Sometimes I drift to my early memories concerning Ayala Alabang. Coming from (old) San Juan (where it was dirtier and has very little scenery- if any) you can say that it was heaven on earth. All the houses were big, clean, and opulent. It was my dream of living in a pretty neighborhood. Unlike mine, where our drunk security guard killed someone who teased him, or a drug addict climbed our FEN antenna attracting the police, or the dirty and smoky from the jeepney that line up along our road.   Or sometimes… being in a fantasy paradise with my close friends. Running through the woods, fighting and using our talents to overcome the odds. Friends and comrades in arms all in one place in a life which is much simpler than this.  I wish I can GM for a living… something I tend to do with more addiction and fervor than anything else a I do. Preparing for games, making maps, cut outs, stories, character art… I wish the gaming industry has space for me.  Thoughts to cradle me in. Before the sandman pulls me in the land between living and the dead.

      my mom has a terrible habit of blaming people and deflecting her own faults to others. It annoys me and its hard to grow up responisible with that kind of example. Sometimes she reminds me of kids passing the blame and ready with an excuse.   Chat Its hard to be greatfull... its even hard for me to forgive. When i was growing up everytime i argued against them and used the logic i learned from school and philosophy they say my logic is flawed.  Dont get me wrong... one thing is to say that you made a mistake... its another thing to explain where and what is it exactly.   Parents as I got Older  As you get older you realize a lot off crap and stupid reasons. Thinking of back then how much i would have accepted an honest answer.   Then there is the issue about jasper's appearance. It may have not been me but hearing them BITCH about it got to me. How would you feel if your parents always made you feel inferior and pathetic all the days of your life.   Thats a sneak peek into jasper's life. Being a middle child, he got the short end of the stick. As friends would know jasper graduated from HRM and has nothing to show for because he hated it. He is a quiet brother of mine forced into socializing. How would you feel if that happened to you... your 23 and wasted 5 years of your life in a job you can't do.   Words cant express how much of a pain that would be... especially when i am suffering a similar fate. Me and Jasper are technically college drop outs. You know how that makes us feel after studying so long and with nothing to show for.   Waste 6 years of your life and tell me how it feels to realize you had to start from scratch...  Now smile and swallow that whole load of crap. SMILE AND ACT LIKE YOU LIKE EATING THAT SHIT!!! YEAH! C'mon keep telling yourself you still have time to snap your life back together when your balls are cut.   Get all that pain and hammer it to the back of your head and as you look at urbanites and everyone who finished SOMETHING!!! and everyone younger you see that you are never going to get those years back.   Someone Special  Despite talent which i know i have and good nature... that is what the UPPER ECHELONS call a losers consolation.  I always hoped that destiny would be mine. That i can use it for some good, not squander it like all the other rich people i know and who parade around TV. I wanted to shift the balance and make basic freedoms available to my fellow countryman.  One freedom being the power to throw off the yoke of corrupted employers, go to school and train for something that will give (me) one the power to take back their dignity.   Even if i did not become someone special in my lifte time at least i found someone special for me. Special being something to make my life great despite my previous dreams of altruism and conquest. If i can't be a hero for everyone, being a hero for someone is a job that is equal.  Its going to be a long 3 years of waiting. It will be school all over again... it will be saving up for a house, learning essential skills my sheltered life prevented me from learning, and the satisfaction that "I could have been a contender" i could have been a real artist.   Its sucks reaching 25 and knowing that it takes me a week to draw a picture, and a couple of days to finish it. The worse thing is despite my parents saying its a talent... they throw it out the window and don't respect the effort i put.    Mom  " why did you do today?"  Me  " I drew"  Mom  "THE WHOLE DAY"  Me  (looking at her as she managed to make it sound like a waste of time)  of course if you love what you do... then take that large piece of steaming shit out of your ass ram it down your throat and lick you teeth and lips cause thats just about how i feel when you keep working on this emotional scab.    Bitter  If you think i'm bitter... what about my brother... tell him he can't reach his dream. HEck take someone's dreams and crush them... Take it as a hobby and you might as well be my mother.

      It is so relaxing being so far away from mom. It is like a preview for the next couple of months ahead.    Jobs  I have applied to many manegerial postitions citing that i am free 24/7 (including holidays and weekends). The new plan is that i work and save up for college and work less once i finish saving up. I know management makes you a slave to the needs of your employer but i need work.   I don't care what mom wants me to take. I will be the one puting my ass through college and I now have the chance to earn my own. Even if it means starting from the dirt. I wish i could get any free training except sales or marketing... cheating people of their money is something i will never stoop to.   Not Finishing all i needed was the rest of this year and i would have been done. Even if it was with a crappy computer. I feel like mom intionally withdrew me from college to delay my plan of "running away" for another year.    Goals  I'll try my best to move to South Jersey and into an appartment ASAP with my bros. I hope that i can pull that off in a year. Or atleast have the money by xmas. Since i am so cheap.    Staring my life all over again  I guess its not bad starting college all over again and even in the age of 25 or 26. At least i can say i earned everything and i have nothing to owe my parents leaving me stranded here without finishing.

      Candy was telling us how Dad wanted to write his biography unfortunately he cant remember what he did. She told us how dad forgot how he punished us.    Corporeal Punishment:  Its not bad... but there is always a better way other than violence and negative reinforcement through PAIN to improve a child's sense of responisbility and duty.   I was telling candy how it was before. When dad would whip me with a belt as far as i could remember. It is scary when your waist high and all you can see is his hand unbuckling a thick leather belt as he walked towards you and your so scared you can't run.   My dad was very much and angry man when i was young. He would always raise his voice when things don't go his way. I remember when he tried being nice by treating us out, it ended with him scolding me for forgeting to close the car door in the rain. I was scared of him for a long time... its hard when you can't remember when you first loved your dad.   I remember how much our parent's tantrums brought us brother together. When mom would whip jobert with a belt and jasper and me would just keep painfully quiet. I remember me and jasper being really close simply cause if any of us failed we would see the other belted and the sight can crush a child's spirit. Seeing your sibling hit with a belt by your own parent at every mistake kinda makes you turn out to be a self centered and pathetic being. I mean i always made escuses and i had no initiative for fear of punishment. I was disciplined but out of fear and not for the knowledge i made a mistake.   I used to always make problems in school. I remember my bottom being slapped infront of the whole class pretty often. You can say my patience for children came from this experience. Nobody had time to talk to me or maybe understand why i act the way i did.   I'm sure everybody suffered a belting in their life. BUT, its hard to apply it correctly. I wish i suffered my mistake from my mistake not from my parents harsh action. I'd rather that then be whipped for a mistake i would never experience till it is already to late in my life.   I remember alot of time i was a child and acted as one... how i would steal from lola's coin jar, how i would throw tantrums and destroy toys and everything I owned, and how i was suicidal at the age of 12.   I think a child should suffer for his/her mistakes but not under a parents stern hand... but through the neutral and unflinching consequences of the action. Lack of discipline would be punished by its consequences and embarasment.    These Days   My mother and older sister loves ranting to everyone how "worthless" we are. How we are too nice to our friends, how we have no ambition to rip people of or sell our soul. They tell everybody how spoiled we are by having maids... at the pure ignorance of how we carried ourselves around peers and friends.   I realize how much my mother is a stranger to me. She was cutting my hair cause i failed to cut it myself. Even at this favor, i feel like i can never see her as my mother but as my debtor i will never be able to repay.   I don't know my mother... When people are at their most vulnerable they call for their mother or father. Being whipped from both of them... I always see the threat of death with the thought of going down in a blaze of glory... but these days i think of someone else and how i want to see her again if that fear ever comes over me.   These days from Ginos stories and RJ's i find myself telling people about their dads and moms more than my own. Its not that i compare... but how much i have a neutral-hate relationship with my parents... i think if i have kids they will resent me and hate me.   anyway i'm chatting with ton and i'm tired typing i'll continue this tom.   BTW we will be at south jersey tomorrow.

      Well thanks everybody. I guess the bartending is a no-no. A guy pushing that hard and repeating the same sales pitch makes you wonder if they can prove it.   Good thing i have no money.   Anyway. I had a wierd dream its.    It begins with some old crushes and a national celebration. I was helping in the filming of a movie. I was helping in the areas of sound and video editing. It came as a suprise when a crush of mine got pregnant. She had nobody to call the father. I guess its because he left before he knew or something i could not think off yet. I was one of her guy friends and helped raise the kid. The funny thing about it is that this was during the time i was preparing to get ready for my own family.   Please remember that this is just a dream.   Raising my own kid and another kid who i treated like my own felt kinda warm and fuzzy. My *wife* (hehe he) was ok with it since she lived nearby and it did not take too much of our time. BTW they were both girls. (I'm more clueless about raising girls than boys)  While all this other complication is happening MY dad's eccentricities have been getting the family in trouble and all we can do its ride it out. From selling the movie's (we are still making) rights and somene throwing my comedy ideas out of the window as we were under new management. That pissed me off, and the worse part was i got less money out of the deal since my ideas were thrown out.   I was down. But going home to my family + 2 was a pretty good thing. I realized since i worked at home half the time and my wife and friend also worked. I took care of the kids the most. Handling two babies was pretty time consuming and ate up my work. Thank god i wasn't the only bread winner.   I woke up but the last thought on my mind was asking my wife if we can ask our friend to move in with us to save money and since this family is getting pretty close. I guess the answer would depend on how my friend and wife would be getting along or how close they are as friends to agree with the idea.   the last image was me and two babies. smiling for a picture. It was like i was the father of 2 kids (who were born a month apart).   Yesterday   It was so windy it tore a page from my sketch book. I was calorie counting again and found myself people watching when we were in the mall.   it feels wierd when you do see more than half the people here obesse. IT sucks cause if you come from a 3rd world country it looks like the people here ARE having to much and are not sharing. NOT that sharing is something they should do. I believe that pitty is not an answer but the genuine help for those who are being oppressed and are voicing their struggle.  I want to watch the new michel moore doc. too bad its too expensive here in the north.    Job  My options are down to security gaurd (half to go to training as usual). Sinice i lithe compared to the average american they might make me an office guard or something "whimpy" i dont mind. I just want the spare time to draw or study.

      I have to admit, I have never been so paranoid. Just a while ago Anthony, the guy from the bartender school has been PUSHING me to pay 800 for bartender class and join the school.  I didn't realize there was so many comercial predators here than the philippines. Everything comes with a little clause. Its scary.   Ex.  I went to staples and i wanted to buy a desktop computer. The celeron computer was made the most expensive even though it should be the cheapest. They made it look more expensive by adding so many promotional costs. Stuff I dont need.   thanks tim for teaching me about comps. I had to take out all the crap to bring the computer to cost to $612 from $860... $300 worth of useless stuff.   another example would be this bartender class and these schools. They ask you to many questions for bartending... they are obviously after something else. They promise to much more than they can offer.   I have to be really cautious. I wish i had friends here i could ask. Its hard to find some honesty here. Its like with every smile there is something sinister behind it.   The GUY was giving me a life lecture for listening to my parents. He is a father himself, he should applaud someone who can read bull and knows who to listen to.   Anyway thats for now.    Health   I'm getting sick because i chose to miss one meal yesterday. I was so pissed at my dad i descided to go to sleep and work it off. I'll eat more now. I think its cause i've been cutting back too much.   anyway i hope to hear from you guys

      I think i need to shave my head? Although I just can't do that.    CHAT  May i shave my head, I don't want to pay P600 for a hair cut here. I was thinking if there was anybody whose opion about its you. So may i shave my hair.    Bartending  I don't know if i should go through with it. Anybody there with an opinion. Do you think i can pull it off as a simple and straitforward natured bartender instead of the hip young chic bartender.   BTW most of the Girls are chicks in the school.    RJ  There are enough hot chicks to make marga look a dime a dozen...  He he he... I'm, taken and like it. These are the type of girls that can wrap guys around their little finger. The types i hate.

       A JOB  I got an interview tomorrow. I guess i have a better shot at being a bartender than an artist.  Heres to you ARJ, if your mom ever forces you to go here Bartenders make $130 a day and is the best tipped.    Kali/Excrima   A Jersey guard noticed our escrima sticks on the way to the park yesterday. This happened again today. I could not get the guards name cause the train arrived but he was nice enough to show us how to get tickets. He had been practicing for 8 years "JKD" cool. He remarked that we must be more hardcore. Well given the standard of living I said it isn't and that all the better martial artists are here. The other guy was George who was working city maintenance, he walked over to us and asked us what school we study. I proudly remarked Doce Pares (translated as 12 pairs or what i liked to call "the 24 masters"). He learned under santos and presas school... which are the more popular schools of escrima around the world.   With my understanding of medieval history and combat thanks to ARMA i can't exactly say i practice a home brew kind of fighting. I can't say that we have great fighters if we have no armor to afford mistakes... I think it is more of lucky fighters.   I have been studying spanish sword and dagger and comparing it to escrima and how and why or DID? our ancestors adopt the two weapon fighting style from the spanish as ARMA suggested.   and i learned that we didn't. Fighting with two weapons a natural thing. Culturaly we did not make great shields and fightiing without using your off hand was wastefull as well as our iron smithing isn't that good to make long blades (like 2h ones) that common. So it WAS natural to have two short swords (technical term for a blade 2 1/2 feet in length that is more for skirmishing, the bolo and talibon have the rough length given) 1 to parry or attack given the opportunity.   I also noticed that fighting in woody or foilaged terrain is an advantage to the short sword wielder and even more to a warrior with two. You can use the trees to give you cover and sheilding against larger weapons (experience from the LARP). I kicked as with just a dagger and shorsword since i could close up and stab/ strike multiple times while my opponent tried to manuever through the foilage.    Jasper  Been teaching jasper and he has been improving steadily. He can parry faster now given the excersizes. We both leared to pary 2-3 time a second while attacking with a riposte.    Chat is Sick!!!  My baby is sick and I'm not there. FAT good me griping about something i can't do anything about. Take it easy baby! I'll take care of you! so don't worry your dreary head.    Blogging  I've been slow to blog and will be slower once i begin "bartender school". Well i'll ry to keep you all updated.

      Bad but not that bad 1) There was a technicality in my drivers test. I could not take it cause they need a proof of address (a mailed letter to me) that comes from the state or a bank account.  2) we got lost in jersey again. I wish i had my license since i have a better sense of direction here.   3) I am tired and want to work out... but can't  Good news  1) My brothers agreed to let me run a Darklands based adventure. Very few people would know what the Game Darklands means to us RPGamers (who played it). Historical Germany with all its cities and prominent figures through history. Pretty cool he.   2) Got a scanner for $80 and a $30 rebate so its basically $50.

      I cam from soccer. I should have taken a picture. I am practicing my kicks and stamina. I think i should time my sprinting speed but none of us have a watch. I'll be taking my driving test tomorrow, thats why i'm trying to get all of this done ASAP so that i can study. I'm running a game for job and jas cause we might need some time away from mom.  We have a house and we are moving in within the middle of july. Mom min/maxed her way giving chris a huge tax break by buying this house, and giving us so much money since the houses value will double in three years cause it is near the ferry ride to NY and is in Jersey city.   Cool eh!?  anyway i got ta write some monsters down. Then i'll study for the driving test.

      Came from a workout. I look like a slacker with just my shorts and glasses.  Anyways...   Gino   Thats cool dude!!! Its nice to hear you guys are doing great. I have news for you guys too! I might be going back home. I will finish my last two terms (or just one if i'm lucky). I'm making 1865 in d20 and fixing it here. D20 is an open system and if i finish in time i can submit it to wizards.      Going Home    I might go home if i cant get a good job here. Its more practical that i finish my last term. before 2006. I miss chat and of course you guys. I'll see if i can find work and fit my system writing before i go back home. I bet I can finish the book (which may be only a small thin one; less than a hundred pages) the book should include all of gino's short stories and everybody else's short gothic stories.    Counting Calories   I am counting my calories now. One as much as 1/8 pound of meat a day the most. Mom makes to much meat... meat is cheap but its no reason to increase the intake of it beyond the norm... MODERATION please.

      I'm here in Mel's house. I answered my loves messages and i am recovering from LBM. Everytime i eat to be full i have a terrible case of LBM an hour or two later... Its the painful kind with a dull pain in the center of your belly. Its ok and all, at least i have great bowel movement.   i'm looking for a gaming group here and still have no luck. I was suprised to find 32 people looked at my profile!?! Maybe its the hello blogbot and pictures that makes this triffle of a blog more interesting.   Well i miss all you guys and you know who you all are. Of course i miss someone else more. Lets hope i make it big a free lance artist and get my citizen ship so i can go back home (to someone in particular) as soon as possible. I thought a great source of hope would be getting myself a lotto ticket every month. Its not a bad waste, even with the odds of getting hit by lightning 3x knowning my luck i have a better chance of winning than alot of people.    What would I do with 1 million dollars!!!  (after putting it in 5 different banks with varying security passwords and etc.)  1- Go back to school again (finishing a 1 year cooking course and attaining at least a Bachelor of Arts) and start a garage based publishing company.  2- Get home here in South Jersey (not spending everything at once... just the down payment... coupled with my imrpved earnings in no.1) 3- Fullfill a promise 4- Fix what needs fixing (like my crooked teeth and eyesight) 5- get those eduction plans  6- Save the rest for rainy days.    making this list, i realize that i can't do some of these things even if i did have a million dolars. Money needs more money... i guess making do is always the best way to live life.

      Well we came from soccer. Well just soccer warm ups and some sparring. Improving slowly. Gaspar started running now, that would lead to better things.   Computer Parts here: Back in the philippines computer parts cost half as much. Despite the matter that it should be cheaper its the other way around.   Anyway, i'm going to fix the computer now. I hope the Ram we ordered gets here early.

       She's wearing it!!!   It is a really present suprise for me to wake up konwing that she started wearing the ring i gave her. Its not much of a ring i have to be honest. It was on our fist date after a month. I descided to get her something. Again i was low on cash and i didn't know what to buy. I went all over virra mall through those jewl stores I was looking for libra stones i could affourd like lapis lazuli and several in a small list of mine. I felt angry that the they were trying to sell me P10 crap for 100!!! i guess it shows how much i can haggle when i don't even try to make a counter offer cause I would be asking for 1/10th the price.   Anyway... they weren't reall stones... it didn't feel like nayhting. I had an errand so i had to go pick up ton2 from his office and drive him home. No biggie... he would have done the same for me and i had nothing better to do. So he helped me look for a gift... we were at the ruins for an hour and a half looking at crap... and then in the last store we checked (we checked all the stores) they were selling mood rings. They were cool cause i know they arent that common and they were part of a bygone age. I also heard that they were these treated mineral (or something) that reacted to the temperature... SO they at least did something.   I gues its a practical represtation of me... cheap, a bit broken and moody.   When i gave it to her, she asked why. I always heard from those father son moments in movies... that the best time to give a gift to a woman is when she is not expecting it. AND cause the first gift i gave was crummy... i felt like I could put much more thought into this one.   anyway... done with reminising.  hunting for jobs again.

      I just came from larp... i have a better understanding how socializing works here and the structure feels like. I guess its funny that i am analyzing it but Comming from back home where people are more hushed and less opinionated i wanted to know the limits of one can talk about.   I understand now that its easier to meet people here once you get into a circle... unlike back home... people will be always cautious... i meet some girls who i feel afraid for... if only the Jerks I know back home were here... they would eat them up... and they would just be asking for it (and maybe more)... I notice a greater range of vulnerability and guard here. I guess thats why this place can turn out pretty impressive individuals given that there are more experiences on can drink...   Its not htat i was meant to live here or anything. I learned and mastered socializing back home... its just that here its all different... its learning a new system  Its interesting... i don't take alot of things seriously here... which allows me to get along with more people. I guess its cool. But i still want to give my honest and exact opions... the way i am with my friends back home... but still i think it would be a while to find people of that kind of ilk...  I have to admit it is easier here to talk... cause you just talk...   ON OTHER MUSHY THINGS I miss chat... again... but having no jobs keeps my mind preoccupide. I still need to deserve it. I know what I have and I am the luckiest man for it.   I'l try to get a job at south jerey first. If i can find one and apply ASAP... i can stay here. There is a soccer field a short way from tita's house. I clean the dishes allong with jasper so its all cool with her. I can be in jasper's room. and we can keep things comfortable.  I do things now... for myself, but mostly because of someone else... it bears greater meaning now. I think of how Time can change things... The pain and suffering... i don't think you can call it that when your with someone... i think you just say "thats life". Taking the sweet with the bitter is so much better when your not the only one taking it.

      Damn the Computer is SLOW!!!  NEWS: WE FOUND A HOUSE!!! well its not yet built. I was worried that a con-man can easily take advantage of us in our situation but i've examined it all and its all good. We found a beautiful home which is still underconstruction.  Its in Jersey City, near the Marina, across the light rail, which is 500m from the bus station, and a minute's drive to the turnpike!!! Did i mention it was 15mins from NEW YORK! WOW!!!  OH YEAH... and THE PARK!!! I CAN PLAY SOCCER ALL I WANT!!!! MWAAHAHHAHAHAHAH!!!!  I heard the Area will develope in 5 years... With mom and dad taking care of the house (which is $700,000). I will save up and use all my reasorces to get a house here. I know where to live. This place gives me access to canada, new york, and everywhere else.   I've begun keeping in touch with Ryan agian. Hello Ryan.   I have been able to exercise a bit... Mel got tired too quickly. I was just getting to second wind and he got exhausted. I wish i could get him to get more into it... At least my stamina is more or less intact.   Were going out again at around 6pm since sun set is at 8pm.   I miss all you guys. Things are for once looking up. With the computer and a living space i will start drawing again. There is a small cafe-like place ment for the public. I could draw there at my liesure.   I just need a scanner and a computer which isn't a DELL. I'll email kathty and ask her brother's address so that i can figure out how i can assemble a computer for less than $500.   GoD!!! there is alot to write since the computer has been down for 2 grueling days.   Going On... I miss Chat. I sometimes see her in the corner of my eye, or when the wind blows i could almost smell her hair. I like her choice of shampoo... its mild and native-smelling. I don't smell the scent here but when certain smells mix out in the park... In the sweet sea breeze i turn around to look for her.    I'm not used to not having my weekly dose of henry, nor am i not used to having pat too far away, and i miss the older sister tone of trish.   I miss the guys, and the fact that a comrade is just in the next building. There is always dependable ton2 who will go at anylengths to please, there are the girls: Kath and Tweet who give me the perspective i need to see.    I'll update some more later tonight. Good day to you all.

Since mom was bugging me back home i couldnt draw that much, stuck with cris I can't draw. I hope to get out of this hell hole or any other place they would want me to stay with cris.   Gino  Hey dude whats up? I was wondering when (or if) she is planning to sell her place. we might buy it, given it is close to allot of places we require.

       i'll post pictures as soon as i get to tita imelda's house (or jobert's comp)    I am here.    And guess who is it that huge thorn that is here with me making matters worse.   Those who know me from way back know that my older sister is the devil’s bitch incarnated. I have never met anybody who would gladly sell their soul for the right price, who can wear the mask of bitch at the same time try to guilt you into helping, a person with no redeeming quality.   I have to admit that I cannot stand her and how she treats my brothers and other people. She is those pillars of corruption that make the world a sadder place to be in.   Patience, is all I have to do is disappear. She loves using people, what happens when people stopped letting themselves be used... THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE!!!.   On other more important things...  I got really dizzy in the flight. I learned early on that all one needs to do is focus on something... something important and dear to them.   I got through it all with the thought someone would be beside me. Someone, will be there and someone who misses me the way I miss her. I don’t know why but this was the best thing to happen to me when I enter a new world filled with fear: someone in my thoughts to hold on to.   I know there are no promises made. I know that a week from now, a month or a year would change so many things and this might change as well. But for all that it is worth, this is the way I feel now, I don’t know what else to feel but this terrible distance...   I do not feel loss yet. I can still smell her. I can’t miss her too badly, she just kissed me yesterday, and I can’t think of anything else but how much I mean those words I keep telling her. Those words that are so corny and have lost their meaning to so many people as time goes bye, but words that never fails to say how simple and great I feel.   Nothing else gives me so much courage than her.

Along with the cleaning, the 2 hour dental episode would have cost P10,000 est. that is roughly 200 dollars. That’s pretty cheap. Kk’s mom goes here for dental work. From Virginia to back here and the week long stay, not to mention that she goes to the same dentist of my dad… the most expensive one… Mr. Rosero. Paolo’s dad.   Small world isn’t it.   I said goodbye to my girlfriend, Chat, it was a depressing point of my day, and so early in the morning. Nothing else can be said… It sucks when I have nothing to prove about how I feel. Time will tell what this relationship means.   I’d like to promise forever… But I can’t. there is that TIME WILL TELL (crap!). I want to try for that but I can’t. I can’t even mention it in front of her because I really have no way to tell nothing is going to change in the next 3 to 5 years.   Sigh…  Crap…  I found the one… That should be something to show for.

      Finding Ms. Right when you’re leaving  I feel quiet. I feel so many things in the same time. Friends of old have wished me good bye, have helped me pack and ready, and treated me out. I have to go and there is so much waiting for me. Yet like every good story there is a twist, a little hook that makes things unravel and makes you understand more about why people believe in a god, or how come goodness triumphs over evil.   It’s such a perfect and clear irony that I’m leaving and I found someone I would want to spend the rest of my life with. Don’t get me wrong, me and her have known each other for about nine months already. Honesty has made us move towards each other slowly which forged stronger bonds than rushing things with half meant confusions. Honesty had a hint of danger since we both knew that the end was near and we wanted to put all the cards on the table. Yet we found more things about each other that brought feelings to an unexpected simmer.   I’m meeting arj tonight and I will be working on the statue for the rest of the evening to clear my mind. I didn’t play soccer or go to Benj’s game… both I would really like to do but I had a strong wish to be alone in my own little way.  I am nothing yet. A blank slate, it is something to be insecure or be frightened about. I wasn’t able to finish college because of my green card requirements. I left college for a one time opportunity to become an American citizen… I never thought I would have this in my life. I wanted to be an American when I was a kid but it wasn’t a real dream, more of a fancy, the way I would fancy to be rich and laid pretty often. Its not really a want but a convenience that isn’t really what I need in my life.   Mel suggested the army… I could speed things up joining the army and I would be more accepted having worked for the stars and stripes like any red blooded American… I wish that offer came when I was at the peak of my health back at high school graduation. I would have jump at the offer given that I was going to BS Math in La Salle… something that was not very pleasant for me. I would have loved the army training the way I loved the ranger training back at UP. And it would have been better, cause I had to make a balancing act Visual Arts while being a ranger. I couldn’t keep up and I hated not being the best in the class.   My only avenue left is art for games or art for comics. Which ever comes my way. I stopped drawing for a while: no scanner… no one to show my drawings to… no point to draw something no one will see.   I draw to express, if that voice is mute then what is there to hear.   All the while it comes back to earning a degree of responsibly and a level of maturity. I can’t stay and get a job in my parent’s company. I can’t do slave labor here, given what I know I can achieve… and that I plan to settle down.   So I really have to go. What keeps me here is the best reason for me to go and make something of my self there.   Dad has been giving good advice:  “If you come back and 'it' is still there then it’s fated”

      Today I woke up at 3:30am, just out of the two days of sleeping 5 or less hours. I tried sleeping again, but my hearing was too keen to notice if the door was being opened and when people passed by. So I had a broken line of sleep.   Today is a “despidida” for candy and technically for me too. I want to introduce my GF to all my friends and show them how happy I am. I also want to let her meet everyone, and the guys who I don’t see much of anymore: Pat, Henry and Trisha. I know they would love to meet her.   I am happy there are no secrets between me and her. She knows everything about me, and I have been trying to think of what stupid thing I have done that she doesn’t know of yet.   I look around me and realize this is what I was missing. I guess I was brooding, grim, bitter and not that pleasant to begin with but this really changed my tone. I really love the way she made me a better person.   …On other things…  I realized me and my GF make a tall couple. Our difference in height may just be two inches (in her heels)… and she doesn’t wear really high ones. She is taller than or as tall as candy.   Anyway... to bad i'm not seeing henry, trish or pat anytime. I'm leaving on friday at around 4:00 in the afternoon to make a nine o'clock flight.

      My Mom.   As anybody who knows us siblings would tell you our mother is a weirdo just like us. Unfortunately, she is not a weirdo the way a stereotyped tree hugging hippie mom would be, a stereotyped artistic mom, but the stereotyped nagging and guilt tripping mom.   I was first grade when they asked me: “Did you love your mom?”. It was mothers day, and when all the kids shouted yes, I was the only one to shout NO. I guess it had been such a deep-seated resentment for her at such an early age. I don’t know if anyone knew about this, as I have a myriad of unusual experiences with my mom (the scar in my left wrist she gave me, the burn in my face when I helped her cook, the scar on my forehead when she was washing me when I was little and I bumped my head on the faucet… etc.).  When I shouted no, the whole class looked at me as if it was wrong. But I guess my life then was not as candy coated as all the other kids. The teacher began to ask me questions and all the children were looking at me and gathered around.   “then who buys your underwear?”  asked the teacher Ms. Bautista “My dad does!” I said knowing full well the real answer.   It was later that week did my mom confront me and ask me about it. I eventually conceded, although I don’t remember if I said I did. I remember that the thought of being thrown out into the street was scary and that I was desperate and vulnerable.   Its clearer now why, early on I never really cared so much about my parents and I completely and quietly resented my mom the most. Even at times of peace I felt like they had better things to do that criticize me and compare me to my cousins. Early on I noticed my mom loved spiting my dad by simply opposing him and saying he’s stupid.  I learned to pit them against each other to get my way or out of trouble sometimes when I was around high school. I was terribly suicidal then, and I kinda understood why I was so clingy to and hated kissing relatives. When I had my first relationship it was like being addicted to a drug. When I am required to kiss strangers and people I don’t like freaked me out and since then I just shake hands or bow my head curtly.  My dad earned my sympathy because how much mom bullies him. Its his character and personality I inherited with his casual disregard of how everyone else thought. Mom kept telling us that dad was the most stubborn of all the men she courted. I am beginning to feel that dad married her for her looks, and not anything else.   I can imagine a lot of those average joes who go for the chicks only to be whipped in the end. Of course the more successful males would just string together a lot of other women. I understand why dad also was faithful… he was tired and gave up on women. In moments about relationships he gives me the best advice. He’s the one who is always ok with what I do and knows I can make anything work given the opportunity. Mom wants me to have a pretty airhead for a wife. She is worried that her line won’t look as meztiso as she would wish.   That’s why she hated my GFs. The only girl they were ok with was Gerry and she was a total jerk and not to mentioned a Dyke who used her femininity to collect favors from guys who did not know better. Don’t get me wrong, she is bottom wrong in the classification of chicks… in GURPS terms she would just have an appearance of attractive.   I would do anything to spite mom, given my chance. I would sign a document to sell my organs for a million + dollars, put it in a time deposit, and give it to mom as a birthday gift as I walked into a hospital with a shotgun in my mouth. I would ask the lawyer to tell my mom: “here is your return of investment”. Shes famous and rich. What more can a conniving guilt tripping mom want.  Only thing stopping me is knowing I want to be alive for someone other then myself. (You all talk! I bet people would say.) Yeah, I guess I am, but it still doesn’t delay my plans.   I want to run away. To successfully run away I have to get a job and not tell anybody except the people who I care for about it. Maybe in a year I can make enough money to disappear with no address or way to communicate except for my blog and mail.   I want to disappear and forget I had such a guilt tripping mom.   Sometimes I wish I was born poor, dying or not at all as long as that I never met her. I know what her relatives really think of her. My titas I guess voiced it out in their habits and way of thinking. You can blame my lolo for that… but the old man is about to die… callous of me to say anything bad about him but I am not going to judge… and I don’t care.  He was a good grandfather (I know what kind of man he can be, I experienced it once and I haven’t met anybody who would get mad like he was born form the fires of hell itself).  Mom reminds me of Catherine de Medici. Using us to attain a level of glory. GLORY!!! Why do I say this, knowing how Christine grew up and how she thinks (candy found her diary and the guys all know what it contained). She is amazingly shallow… she is a plastic, fake, poser and hypocrite.   Strangely MOM is Christine. And if mom is Christine then things become clear who she was to her sisters or what kind of people would grow adjacent to such people.   Scary, dad’s personality is really the mix that broke the mold. Chris hates dad, I don’t know why (being that she was never got the lashing side of a think leather belt unlike me and gaspar).   Anyway…  That’s that, I’ll disappear. America is the best thing to happen to me. It’s a way to escape her… forever! I will never emerge. Anyway, she has Chris, who else does she need?  He he he… I love using that. If Chris is all she ever wanted in a child, then she can have her.   Its not filial envy, more of how the two faced virtues she exalts and uses be when it is in a time or manner she is most in need.   I guess they deserve each other.

      I’m at home about to leave with candy and her friends to visit Toei Animations.   I just got back to having lunch with my (dare I say it? )… in mandarin oriental. It was great and she ate a lot, that’s good. I think this is the most we ate together (it is a sign). We started early so we could take our time eating. I felt bad she had to pay for half, given that It was my idea to eat here. I though I would only have to pay 990 per person, and with the privilege card only pay for just one. I didn’t see it coming when they calculated P1,980 + 10% VAT= 2,178 -990 (privilege card discount) and I’m still stick at paying 1188.  I only brought 800 pesos. Whoah! I over looked that one. I didn’t want her to pay to much. It was my idea to eat there. Thankfully she help me take care of it.   We also ate out yesterday. We ate at denicios(?!? Not sure about the name really) then we ate at UCC. I have to admit, this is the most glamorous I have ever been on dates. I’m always the penny pincher. I guess since I’m leaving I better go out with a bang.   Mom said I didn’t do anything yesterday. Well mothers can be pretty annoying when I had a 24hour day, and she calls that nothing. My god its like I’m the one talking to the unreasonable teenager.  10:00 pm(Sunday) had a fight with mom so I went strait to bed 3:40 am(Monday) Lola woke me up 4:45 am Got back from the airport and started working on the computer. Downloading and Burning CDs. I was also typing stuff and packing my bags.  12-1:30pm Had a date with Chat.  2:00pm went to CSB 3:30pm Met Philip Laplana to give Gaspar’s papers 5:30pm Left to drop candy of at Catherine’s place in green medows 6:00pm got back to fix comp. and burn 7 disks (at 25 minutes each). At the same time organize CDs for airport inspections. I also gathered all the stuff I was going to give back to Pat.  9:30 talked with my baby :)) 10:30 picked candy up 1:30am  picked up ArJ 2:30 got home and continued working. 4:50 went to sleep but still cant stop thinking of what I need to organize.  And mom had the GALL to cut my sleep into 4 hours and say I did nothing. I’m tired of being the mature one. And nursing this crone’s habits. I have a good mind to disappear once I get enough money for my own place in America and cease contact (ever!) with my parents.   Oh yeah I just realized ate has been stealing our stuff. I just noticed that its only me and candy and we only loose our stuff in the house, yet they are completely lost. I swear, I must have lost two boxes of pentel pens yet I don’t see any lying around and I don’t take them out of the house. My sara mclachlan CD is missing when didn’t ever bring it with me to school since I can’t play it and strangely so is it’s case (I separated it from its case and now the case is missing).  Good thing we don’t have help in the states.

       urlLink    Here is the new one... the picture in the background is lynn. An Non-Player Character i made when i was in Highschool i remade. Her story is that she was a peasant girl who was "damaged" by a noble in a tragic and harsh land. An old man filled with secrets and agendas gives her the strength most giants would envy. Her life gets more complicated being the hero she longed for... but still she was never rescued. Until she meets a simple and unimpressive free-farmer. A man who was in all things as simple as she was before her gift was given... it becomes one of my game mysteries why she fell for that guy and she lived happily ever after. Its not that i know... it just mirrors life in the way it is unpredictable and sometimes flat out straitforward.  I combined several stories to make her... she was a female captain of a deathsquad (warriors who serve a sentence as being fodder, as they are all always in the front lines). She falls inlove with the lot of them. Not in a whorish way that teen agers would first think of when a woman had many lovers. Its just that she became very intimately close to men who were doomed to die and it is at that very moment these men blossomed into heroes. They were all disgraced knights... and when she survived after the campaign she was called the Knight of the Hundred Roses. She has a tattooed rose for every man that died with her love (friends and lovers). She also was known as the knight of thorns as she later distanced herself from men.  &nbsp; urlLink

       And another obstacles is thrown my way   Well what can be as same as old as when I am fight my dad these days. When mom is not enough, I have to deal with this absentminded foggy. At least with dad I can shout back at him, with mom I can only be silent , shrug my shoulders, and do what she says (or just leave).   My parents forget that WE are in America now. I can just leave when I have earned enough (and that wont take long).  I guess what I could do when we move to the south is keep my moving boxes. I don’t have any real bonds with my parents. So there is really no reason I will stay. Like my cousins who are under tito john, Being in America meant that if things can get along you can leave.   My parents aren’t perfect… they have their good and bad. But I honestly can say if they were a much poorer and much nicer I would have been happier. Fuck money when you really have fun with your family.   There is a choice in life where you can buy happiness or get it for free. I’d rather get it for free with people I care about than have a landlord and banker for parents. Always reminding you who owns everything and that you don’t own squat.   When I have my own kid, I will give him all the skills I can teach him to be independent of me. Not to mention the horror stories I have with my parents and the Philippines.   Job told me that it can be hard if your child sees you as an equal. I don’t think that is bad, especially when you raised the kid with love not money. He forgets that when he was younger that in Philippine culture I will be “higher” than him. Look how he turned out. As equals is better (when they are older). It is better that they make their mistakes than to rob them of the experience and when they make other mistakes blame them.  How can you not love a country that advocates so much freedom (more than back home). I promise myself that I would take care of them, given that I can. Lets leave them to their favorite child: Christine. They deserve each other. I wouldn’t care what happens as long as they don’t affect my credit rating.   I am a good son. I am as good as a son the standards of Philippines sons have and more. But with no respect, they can go fuck themselves. My dad is asking for trouble cause to argue with me is to argue with half of mom. And that is still a lot of BITCH to argue against.    Sumbong    Jasper told me dad was harassing him. I told dad that he should not tell jasper he’s lazy when Jasper works harder than him. If he did not relent I could bring up that he wasted 5 years of jaspers life in a course that did not suit him. That it was his decision for letting him waste years being a HR manager when he could have been an engineer.   I can argue the crap out of dad easily these days cause he’s gotten weaker willed. Mom made him that way. He can’t control us cause the relationship with mom isn’t exactly loving. &nbsp;  He holds her and thinks of the time he first met her. Not the relationship he has with her now. My dad had a lot of unrequited love, and mom just took to him because guys stopped trying. She was 26 when she met dad. By that time all the other guys have given up and her “prudence” has let the good ones go.   I can figure out from looking at how he stares out in space when he says he’s happy. It is a man stuck on the past than a man who lives at the present.    Thankfully this blog lets me remember this. When I am much older I would need to be reminded of who I was when I was younger. I know everyone loses a lot of himself as he loses his youth. I hope I just lose the youth and not myself. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

        I am listening to “Chat’s Gift”    I found time for myself given how hectic the day was. Started at 12:00 and continued on and on. Its 12 and I am finding the time to learn some programs Dad brought over for me to study. I wish I can learn them fast and well. Its like school but with no pressure from teachers. The cool thing is that I study and learn at my own pace and standards. Which happen to be higher than back in school. Now my standards involve good enough to get me a job.   Mom is giving me a hard time as I refused to leave the computer on the second floor. I just don’t want to be bothered so badly that I brave this damp, smelly(super), and sometimes scary basement. Of course any more about my mom and I might get an ulcer, so for sanity’s sake I will drop it for now.   Chat made my day yesterday and her effect on me is still lingering even up to now. It’s a feeling that is similar to the rapid hover of a humming bird… a blur of movement that doesn’t seem to move.   … I cant stand the smell… I’m getting a lighter…   Ok, that is slightly better.  About School… I don’t think I will study anymore. Not until I start working… and work my way into being a kick ass artist. I guess I will only go back to school if I can cheese it out. Like, if I …  Ok dad had to use the internet. I’m back again.   Anyway, I guess I will do college by the time I have a place, a steady job or jobs, and someone who I can go home to. College is a formality to me. The piece of paper doesn’t mean anything anymore coming from back in the Phils. I like it here when I can pay for my own tuition. Fuck it if its not an ivy league school, I don’t care for much about the elite cause here I’m part of the working middle class who spends time with those who matter to them instead of money.   Success and Career to me is helping others… One can say that I am hiding from it. Well why not, I am not designed to make a lot of money. I’m here to help other people. Despite how small some pricks might think this role is… more people in this role would certainly kill the amount of dicks there are in the world.     Gaming.     I wonder if I can find a game here? I'll look for a group. Damn thats pretty hard.     Soccer    Whiling picking Dad up we passed by a soccer field around the area of Liberty State Park. It was all lit up (it was 9 in the evening) and there was a game. I felt so jealous. I want to play and train. Dad said he would gladly pay for my soccer amateur league membership. I told him he didn’t have to, all he needs to do is help me get on my feet and everything else I can provide for myself.     Speaking of Goals   I have to learn the programs I have here. Even at the cost of some drawings. I should get a good understanding ASAP. That way I can start sending my art and posting them,&nbsp;  &nbsp;

But i woke re energized and sane. Wow, is that even distance doesnt prevent that kind of intimacy... if only you work at it.   I don't want to jinx it or slow down.

       July 27, 2004, 6:25pm   I am here in the basement trying to work on my new computer. This is my brand new computer I so named Pork town. Where else can the lonely pig hang out but in such a quaint plot of misery?   Well it was a shitty day. It is raining and there is a tornado warning in central jersey. My aunts after “helping” us clean up the house. “Helping” I don’t know how cause Mom was so confused about them coming that she wanted us to clean (and we did) the house up for the.   NOW they can easily take credit for the work WE did in return for stay in the house by New York City.   This House is for my mother’s plans Everyone’s house. This is a house where everybody can sell their favors to stay in for the night as they either work or enjoy the city of New York.   Leverage is a tool my mother loves to use.   My surroundings:  It still smells like cat shit and dog piss in the basement. I don’t particularly mind, I am here at the computer hoping that America online happens to be a internet provider and it can give me a chance to email chat.   I wish I could use the internet now. But I have to figure out what AOL is all about. I know you get free 3 months worth of AOL. BUT WHAT THE FUCK IS IT?  If it’s internet, can I access my blog? Can I access my mail… I want to talk to chat. I want to tell her how much I miss her and how I think of her constantly.   It’s raining and dark outside. A scented candle keeps me company pushing the deathly smell of rotting matter and my filthy surroundings at bay. I have, where the computer is set up a desk. It looks like something from the 80’s as it’s design is something I haven’t seen since I was running around in my underwear and everything was twice my size in Dad’s office garage.  … its 7:03 I got internet thru AOL. I will only use it for a month then I am disconnecting.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Sunday and Today(monday)   As soon as we arrived that evening at 6 (it was as bright as 4pm back home) we started carting and moving stuff to the new house. We have been doing the same since this morning    CHRISTINE THE BITCH    She arrived from san fransisco at around 12midnight. She and mom had an argument on the phone cause tin was to "tamad"/lazy to let US come over and give her stuff for her stay in the appartment.   She had the GALL to argue with us (specifically mom) to push everything to the next day. BTW she left friday night for San Fran. just to avoid our hectic house cleaning an moving operation over the WEEKEND (the only time she was given berth to help us given she only works 2-3 hours a day)   Anyway I said to Mom "how dare she&nbsp;do&nbsp;'THAT'&nbsp;after WE (me and the guys) put out so much work for a house SHE WILL BE LIVING IN (not us)"   News! well she did not go to a work related activity, she went to a wedding and had FUN!!!   the conversation this lunch...    BITCH:  I'm eating all the vegetables, MOm make some more.   Observation:  Suck-UP,&nbsp; Suck-UP, Suck-UP. While jasper was the one&nbsp;eating most of it. Mom makes some more. I go "its all yours" and she denies ever asking for it.    BITCH:  Candy clean my plate  I'm tired    Observation:  &nbsp;Tired of what? waking up and doing nothing or sucking&nbsp;doctor's cock you whore.&nbsp; Jasper and I both loudly cleaned our plates saying " I'm CLEANING MY PLATE  CAUSE I CARRY MY WEIGHT IN WORK AROUND THE HOUSE "    BITCH:  There was so much chocholate in the wedding i felt so bad   Observation: &nbsp;&nbsp;Feel bad for gaining an inch on your burgening waitline! YOU FUCKING SHOULD YOU HOE!!! WHERE IS THE GUILT FOR LEAVING US TO DO THE WORK FOR YOU HOITY TOITY BITCH!!!   I just made sarcastic remarks the whole meal. When mom talks to us it upsets me so much it manifests itself visibly. I need a vacation... this is not a vacation. It is a FUCKING NIGHTMARE   The whole day(mon) was spent moving... From 8:30 (i havent washed my clothes in 2 weeks now, i havent had my turn with the washer and its broken right now, I ran out of underwear and had to settle for chaffing shorts and a shirt i used for 3 days strait) to NOW... thats 1 am roughly 16hours....   Did i forget to mention that i will only have five hours of sleep, I found a tick from the larp on my stomach, candy's careless and wild swings in practice bruised me, and i havent taken any painkillers that day, was part of the day's routine.   Oh yeah... my mom doesnt know how hard i am working... there is no acknowledgement of all the crap I (and WE) go through given that she puts us down (we all over hear her) to all her friends and tells them how useless we are and praises our&nbsp;BOOT LICKING,&nbsp;COCK SUCKING, PILLOW BITING,&nbsp; BITCH ASS FUCKED&nbsp;WHORE OF AN OLDER SISTER chris.

        LARP    We started at 2:30pm and left at around 2am. There are rules that work with the way you fight. Usually it works with declaring a special attack or ability as you successfully hit a person. You can also use a special skill, or "feat" (as what it is called in the game) to negate it or redirect it.    So its a bunch of us in constumes where we hit each other and declare our special powers. after a while it doesnt sound sily and get pretty serious. In a game where blows are traded alot people fudge the rules. Its natural... The system is not perfect BUT I was hoping that characters would be alot more fair with the use of their abities.  This larp it was a ninja fest. Ningas have a devastating ability to kill in a blow to the back and calling assassinate which can be defended with a special ability once per day and a character can immunize himself to it only for a short hour or so.   As a  non-player character  (namely someone who helps out hosting more than playing) i find fun not endorsing my ego with a character where I have to compete with other character at my disadvantage of level.   As a  npc  I dont have to involve my self with petty disputes between alter egos. And as i stay longer i eventually get a Game Master character... a powerful PC with out having compete with the squabling masses.   Anyway going back to what happened. We had a couple of modules where characters fought  "us"  ninjas and we slaughtered the host of them. I felt bad killing weaker character so i used my other abilities instead. But when it came to a bunch of "sigas" or Geek-Pride (the geeks who love lording over other geeks) i dispensed with the assassinates and let them die to make them lose experience points. I'd kill them more often as i got better.   I was the fastest person in the whole LARP... its funny cause i would expect all these taller kids with greater stride and muscle should have it better than this old timer. I ran after them and with my soccer cleates gained and backstabbed the weak and killed the strong. A great way of evening out all of them.   There are alot of Egos even in Geek land. I admit I'm a geek but I know very well not to lord over the weeker and that strength means that i should help other nurture theirs. I know some people don't like this philosphy, and it can be my undoing. But, this was what i have been doing back when i was in highschool when there were people who needed a little help, advice and lessons their way.   In return, by kharma I guess. I tend to run into people who are willing to teach me and give me a hand. I know a much prouder man would decline such a humbling position as a student BUT i take what i can get.   DB (danny boy) Lupus of the Lupus Brothers  was offering me to teach me to sew when we move closer by. I accepted hiding my excitment with a calm and appreciative exterior. Anyway  someone  here would be really appriciative if I knew the skills which is part of her passion for fashion.    DB  said that he will give me all the fake leather I want (which is about 20 yards of it) if i did&nbsp;half the work of sewing them. My reply is HEll yeah! he can even give me more. I&nbsp;know that i&nbsp;need the practice and i dont have money for materials for now and&nbsp;what may be a while. Sewing, using powertools, and a little metal smithing (making chainmail) isnt a bad way to spend my time other&nbsp;than drawing. I always need somethign to take my mind of my art or&nbsp;I will fail to take an objective/outside look at my work. &nbsp;  I'm really tired...  The jerk ass guy i know who is such an "adrian" or goo (someone who is all talk, toots his own horn, yet has a slimy underbelly... in this guys case bullying other people) was talking how casually he was beaten by his father.    I basically did a patrick  by denying him the spot light by saying "You can just say it that way!" He sounded like he was showing off so it was easy for everyone to voice how they felt about someone making himself the tragic hero.   I admit i should have worded it that he should not have said it so casually because other people have it worse and he belittles such&nbsp;the tragic experience of others.  I will get better in time&nbsp;and think faster. I already have a number of contingencies andplans in my mind to sew doubt in the minds of the group by making them think for themselves and not taking too easily the words of someone who love to blow his own horn.   He should know better when your around someone from a third world country (or worse) never to compare the life you live.   Speaking of that: i gave long list of cool thing to do in the philippines if your from america. Like how you earn so much and if your earning dollars in the phils you set. Also how some americans use their embassy to protect them from the laws back home, or how cheap is a hoochie, or how much do some philippine actresses go for.   Any red blooded american man would take up the chance to visit such a place and have that fun. Well, i guess it might sound bad what i did to my country given that i " pimped"   BUT if word gets around i will be helping the industry by putting some much needed dollars in the economy... and giving a tourist industry a chance to come to get it's engine greased.    Every little thing helps.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Its 9:10am here. I just woke up from what must be 6 to 51/2 hours of sleeping. I had those fumble of images that resemble the dream. I forgot what it was but it didnt seem important.   Yesterday The house lies in Morris street NJ. its mean of me to say but mom became extra popular buying two houses. Two titas are benefiting from it if not directly.... one tita is getting at taxbreak while mom is paying for it, while another tita has a place for her son to stay.   I dont like pets... given that i am cleaning after 4 years of pet doo doo in the garage. the house smelledlike a funueral parlor when we first came. Thanks to the bleach and vinegar we took the smell away. We are thinking of taking out the soft lighting and pinkish color for a more vibrant and active looking blue.   Down at the basement "future room" there was a lot to be done cause as you enter it smells like pet shit. The carpets on the stairs had to go having been riddled with feces and piss that no amount of bleaching can take away. It was poorly cleaned as the germs and odors ave entered the plywood base. All we can do is pain over it to seal the evil stentch.   I would have to get extention cables for both power, phone and cable. The basement needs water proofing and we need to get rid of the stagnating pool. The house would look better if there was no pool and more space for a barbeque. There are sacks of concrete and the basement has not been flood-proofed so there is a lot to do given that we will be living there for a month.   Mom wants to get rid of the garage and convert the basement area to another furnished room.  I agree and hope it will be easier to clean and better lit so that work, despite the chore of it, is not all to discouraging.   I have to assemble my comp when i get back but not before i get the cables and wires. There is alot to do.  Today there is a lARP. I will be attending at around 12 or 1... which follows with a barbeque. I was hoping to stay till tomorrow but understand that i have to drive back to jersey. Yes, i am driving now... and the first car i have to drive on the american highway is the heavy pickup that is AUTOMATIC.  Ok i didn't know how to drive an automatic. I still look for the clutch and shift gears when i stop... as i would forget what i was driving. But i will get used to it.   I wil be passing by tita baby today to get the furniture after the larp. Then proceed to the 2-hour car ride back to jersey city. I wish i could stay longer but there is no way by which mom can go to sunday mass the next day. She doesnt know how to comute that well. Despite that she has jasper for company.   jasper is missing out alot in what me and jobert do. hope he can enjoy eventually.  Anyhow i got this all down and i'll be leaving again for a whole week in the north. I hope i can have time to go to a public library or be able to set up our computer.   &nbsp;

      I have drawing from the convention BUT!!! its in RPG barkada... just put your emails in the rpg barkada group... i'm planning to be active and make it a real&nbsp;Group about philippine RPGs. I guess i could start by starting a PBEM (i hope not).  &nbsp; Well according to Joe, denis and the guys would want to have the same good fortune BUT we both agreed Gamers Eyeball Manial WAS a real con... &nbsp; ... with fake people. &nbsp; I guess if we were there we could help make another con possible. With our RPGa herald level GM memberships on the way we could run living greyhawk.  &nbsp; But Titus is an RPGA memeber and its not so hard to join... why dont you guys register and start an RPGa community in the Phils.  &nbsp; We can help mail the stuff there and other things from here since our parents will be visiting often and we are computer geeks being online most of the time.  &nbsp; .... &nbsp; Herald Level GM number as soon i get it i'll be running living grayhawk games open to everybody and anybody in seewell. As often as i can... probably twice a week. Its 2 points per session and i guess if make 4 points a week... I can make master level in a year.  &nbsp; Joe is running is game too so there will be a huge community of gamers later around our area.

        What happened from thursday to saturday.   DEXACON  (and no internet access)    We arrived 9am...  We were able to go to a Living Greyhawk game. There as six of us. The adventure was crystal caverns. Me and Job used brother deep halflings (cheesy halflings that had darkvision-the ability to see in absolute darkness at a range of 60ft and stone cunning- great insight with rocks and stone crafts/architecture/formations. I was a druid with a wolf and "joe" was a sorcerer.   Mark Rayes (wizard 2)   comment- looks like and sounds like a americanized filipino BUT he did not seem to understand us when me an job were speaking in tagalog. He could be considered gwapo back home and he is very tall... 5'10" or 6. He wore all black with the black framed gallses, shorts and ankle boots. Like what i would wear... here he has a west coast look... which makes me really suspect that he is filipino. He looks like the type of artists in Malate that Toby and Wango would know.  A very veteran and rules keen player.   Duff (sorcerer 1/monk 1),   comment- very generic looking but simple in character use monk. We saw him a couple of times through the course of the three days. He ate with us and he came from newyork. hes cool but we didnt get a chance to know more about him.   Kirk (halfling cleric of yondala)   Background- dirty and really sleepy when we first met him... later that day we get to talk to him and find out he BIKED all the way from philidephia wich was 80 miles away!!! yep it took him 8 hours from midnight from his friend's house. He stayed till 4AM and took the train going home. He was cool in my book... i wish we got contact information cause if he planned to do that again me and job both agreed to let him stay with us in our place if he needed.  Comment- spaced out but really nice. He was spanish handsome. Hes thin-wiry and that is unusuall because 85% of the people who went here are extreemly obesse (i mean round as balls and took up two seats).   Brain (dwarven claric of the sun god)   Bg- the world chapion of DnD minatures! he looked like an army man as he was BIG and BUFF yet he was uncommonly handsome (because geekdome doesnt get the good looking ones playing). He was mentaly and physically acute as he was as cheesey and masterful with the use of rules as we two brothers were and then some!  comment- He was raised around filipinos being in california in a navy area and know our culture... cool! he is also a GM and a hard working person who has a very rounded lifestyle... geeky hobby, fly fishing, athletics, and social skills!!! he was as cheesey as his dwarf cleric of Pelor.     GAME COMMENT-  it was a table of one of the most elite gamers who did not know each other. It was like having rick, charles, cyril, jasper, me and job with a GM as good as any of us AND he ran THE 8 hour adventure in 3 1/2 hours. IT was fun and seeing these guys max out their own combos which are all equally as good, cheesy and original was a dream. OH yeah here is the clincher!!! NO PERSONALITY PROBLEMS!!! Everyone was both nice, civil and friendly. You cannot ask for a better group of RANDOM STRANGERS.     GURPS 4th ed    Scott Haring-  he was very old school, no offense but if i am blunt enought to say that thats really bad by other peoples standards. The game was very poor given that the game writer did it in one night (tuesday) and its thursday... scott should have atleast have read it already. I could make up an adventure in 3 hours wich was better and BETTER MADE CHARACTERS!!! Scot was the Editor of pyramid... NOW i KNOW WHY! he does need the retirement if he cant handle the new rules...  I had second thoughts of giving him my resome to give to gurps.  I mean no offens by this... its just that my expectations when i meet other GURPs players is rules mastery... GURPS is a harder system to learn... the amount of rules you should have on your person is greater than D20 cause D20 doesnt expect you to memorize it all. BUT GURPS!!! AND AN EDITOR OF PYRAMID!!! if you have a title be ready to defend it. I had to be quiet the whole game... except for the many times i had to explain to him the new rules.  I EXPLAIN TO HIM!!! now that sucks.  anyway the prize was gurps rome... which i already had... but i could not get cause the character i got sucked and i could only use well if i meta gamed.  Overall... i regereted it... but came out with 5 copies of gurps lite to run my own demo games for. DAMN!!!    MET  RK milholand-  artist/writer of Something Positive. He got praise from Niel Gaiman in his speach. A big deal in the world of geeks (like me). Hes cool. He was supposed to go to some of the games we signed up for but he didnt go? dont know why?     Met the Following people    Derick  (cool rocker looking gamer)   Kevin C?  (nice gm and player... a table i wish i could play under he expemplified every GM virtue ESPEICALLY MERCY!!! for this 2nd level halfing in a 4th level game)  "Valarian" ( this old timer who was very nice and cool. He was so helpful and friendly he made us feel so welcome. he looked like a wizard with his long hair, extreemly sharp and narrow nose, and and thinly haired head... ohnyeah someone he was thin)    This guy who looked like jackie chan!!! i mean dead ringer!    2 obnozious large chines guys... not as great or kick as as our own GREAT LEADER (denis) but interesting that if denis was here he would blend in... and KICK THESE jerk's assess. They were rude, arrogant, and wel... not easy to get allong with.    Met a  Gelo-like  person. Annoying, talks about 2nd ed allot, gets angry for the slightest wrongs, cannot make ANY KIND OF FUNNY!!! (not to mention same build and glasses... but wears a graying mustache and beard.     In the very end... I missed chat so much... i forgot the details of the rest of it all. I just kept thinking of her so much i have 3 sets of drawings of her in my table for these days. Not to mention how much i wrote about her in my private pocket journal.        Will post more... someone else has to use the comp.&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      I deleted that post cause i want to get my head together for a more civil way of critisizing it. I have to get my sources and i hope the    Gino   Thanks dude, that helps. I forgot about that and beter incorporate it in my training.    Dreams   Funny dream, i had a dream that a friend married another friend already. It was like a suprise wedding/ proposal. Funny and so much like the guy i know. It was about time and everyone was just so happy.

       Other Goals   i've been trying to improve my soccer performance even without the help of a team. it sucks to practice alone. I practice half an hour by myself in soccer. I usually work on my accuracy, my dribling, my speed and my tactics... RJ is not the only one who dreams of being able to play professinaly.   I guess you would have to take my word if you don't know me that i was one of the best defenders in high school. When Southridge took on Ateneo de Naga I was the defender that mattered the most.   I don't know why actually... Noel Castro could outrun me in a sprint but when it came to chasing a ball i could out run anyone.   I was highschool and the underdog. We had a game with atenoe de naga and i expected to be on the team. I wasnt a varsity member but everyone (my firends) at least knew i was one of the best defenders of the school (and possibly one of the best in the country given that we were the #1 highschool varsity team and the country's representatives).   They didnt put me in the defending roster. I was the president of the sci-fi club what would i know about soccer? I dont know what changed the coach's mind but they put me on the second half. Naga already had 2 points lead. I was raring to go. In that half I prevented 2 goals... why do i solely attribute it to myself (other than those who witnessed it) cause it was only me and a lone attack who broke through our defense. It happened twice.   now when i get to thinking about those days that deniro move comes to mind " i could have been a contender" a night game accident left my righ leg with a numb spot so it was easy for me to get over shin hits. I eventually stoped using shin gaurds. I was the track and field rep of the school for 100m, 200m dash, longjumps, highjumps (all the leg related sports) but what dibilitated me was the fact that I lived in san juan and it was the equivalent of going to mercer county from jersey city every day for school. Thats relatively how far and how long it took me to go to school. It was a 1+ hour drive to and fro school (total 2) DONT FORGET THAT WE HAD A STUPID CURICULUM AND I WAS TRYING TO CATCH UP with my latin and math.   Peer presure also helped kick me out of soccer. The "sigas" or jocks were not fun to play with given that they never appriciated the support they got from the defense. Given the hiearchy, geeks weren't that imporant enough to be worth keeping. I dont blame them... too many things to do at one time stopped me from kick ass in soccer.   NOw at 25 i can't find a team to join. I cant find a field. All i can do is play by my self every other day hoping that another soccer player sees me and invites me. I've been posting on the internet soccer boards but a rusty asian isnt what they have in mind to play with... I cant play with the 30+ guys cause I still have my health and youth... and I"M IN AMERICA soccer is a kids sport (its near impossible to find a soccer legue that is greater than U23).   Not to mention i dont have a home yet. The movie "the Rookie" keeps cycling in my head thta I can still make it. Even back home i can still outrun anybody on the field (and these guys were once varisty) I kick stronger now, nearly doubling the range i can make since i came out of "retirement".   I know speed and strength are not the only factors. I been drilling in fast dribbles, feints, and hard turns. I practice when i can even if only some of the field is available.   I guess this is sounding more like a prayer. I'm in the middle between being good enough and being amature I just need the chance to train, to drill on a professional level.   I'm not a thai or a brazilian... i am a philippino... i come from a coutnry who looks up to america too much that they should be playing soccer instead of basketball given how short we are. But soccer is not a popular sport back home niether was it in the culture.  In my family my lolo played soccer in his childhood in ust and ilo ilo. thats it nothing great can be expected but i somehow havent seen in myself the ability to fail given the chance to improve.    Arnis   Here in america they call it Kali... JKD teaches so of it... but if you ask me what they teach is really just the tip of the ice burg. thanks to arma dispite dissing kali/escrima in their article (even if none of them are experts of it) i learned enoough about western sword arts to understand the principles behind the techniques they teach us in the school of doce pares.   1- Contrary to the beliefs of ARMA (Association of Raniasance marital arts) alot of cultures use 2-w fighting and our ancestors did not learn it from the SPanish... it is simply that 2 swords are better than one. How much science can there be...   WHat pisses me off is that they critisize japanese martial arts and swell us ours without any expertise on it. NOw thats plain dumb!  2- Its hard working on sayaw... so i have to practice in the park when there arent any people around. Of course in AMERICA one should not find it strange for a japanese practicing karate or kendo, neither a chinese guy praciticing taichi or kung fu, so as to see a filipino practice kali. In the city i get JKD and a big happy hi! from fellow practicioners. WHile here in the south... well its a bit of a WTF i hear more often.   3-thanks to padded sticks i wont brake my fingers which i neeed for my profession... BUT i need to buy supplies to fix them soon. Improving slowly... working on the same problems as before though.

       Gino and Kath   Congratulations! on your 5 years :D I'll try to mail you insead. Its just that your email tends to fill up quickly (alot of people want your attention), I'll email Kath instead (since she checks hers more frequently).     Work Update   I got some work done but i still need my scanner from christine's place. My work pace is improving and the amount of usuable art has increased (if only slightly). I'm planning to ride the groove.    Comic Writing   I have to find funny time to write as well as serious time to write the more underlining stories.   I plan to have two to three web comics.   The first is  RPG BARKADA . Basically its all the Guys in a funny comic. Hopefully everyone can be fit into the story line and humor. I guess henry would be the funniest character in the whole strip given traslation.  The second is  Dreamy Days  but in an introductunary story for all the charaters. Its a serious story with dark humor... hopefully it comes off well. Its not gonna be funny knowing how sucky my writing is and how green (new) i am so i guess its an excersize in comic writing.   The third is  RPG barkada Illustrated . I will put into comic form Jobert's games, My games and other games the Jaquinos have played as well as the Rpg legendary moments. Like henry's offanim of creation and his brush with the soldiers of hell.   I'm trying to brainstorm and i need all the help i can get.  Please leave comments on ideas and things we talked about last and forgot.

       Excersize   I practiced soccer "by myself" fo thirty minutes. I wish i could have been working out longer but there is only so much one can do by himself. I did dribbling excersizes: weaves, sudden stops and bluffs. I practiced my kicking accuracy and realized if i come from 90 degrees of the ball instead of from behind my kicks are more accurate. I can hit a post (my target) at 30ft 40% of the time... and all the other shots are close.    Sparing   Turtle-ing is when you get down low to attack you opponents legs. As you can reach his legs easily, the opponent can't reach you as well. A new weapon for me.     Drawing   I can blame the bad vibes but this Dunken Donut guy was such a jerk. No nice personality, terrible english and was a total meanie.   Ex. This taxi driver was asking if she can use the CR. She said she was going to buy... but come on, a taxi driver in the sub-urbs. She must be a long ways off. and its 12. let the woman pee... there isnt a rest room for a way off. How would you feel?  There is this other woman who wanted her egg cheese and ham sandwitch without egg and simply told him... the guy could not understand. I'm sure the minimum english ability required would allow that concept. He could have been polite and said "egg cheese and ham sandwitch and have a nice night..." but no. The guy had to be such a jerk.   The other dunken donuts was better. The guy was nicer and he didnt mind us as at all. C'mon we didnt make any mess if fact we clean up, we are just a couple of geeks... one drawing the other writing there should be anything wrong with that?  Anyway were paying customers. And at night, for the space and silence to work the guys should not be so touche.   Anyway... i fucked up my drawing. I was tolerating him but i guess if i was bothered then my full concentration was not there to draw.  Webcams  Well talked to chat yesterday.

       Long over due excersize    I was able to work out. DOing soccer drills and spariing with jobert. My form is slowly taking shape and my tactics have been improving. I know how my attacks should not leave me open and my parries have a wieght of intent in them not just dumb luck parries.   Foot work needs reworking. A wider stance is much more stable but with my tactics relying in mobility i should have my legs bounding back and forth like a boxer.   the work out was 8:30 in the evening. It was unusual given that sunlight fadded at around 9:00.   Then there were alot of fireflies. Where i work out there is a baseball pitch. A chicken wire area stops the balls falling into a wooded area that is heavily shaded. If you stare at it the fireflies gives a hint of magic and enchantment to someone who had not seen them before. YOu dont see the fireflies till they give their burst of liminance.   Its quite nice. I heard we also have fire flies back home in the phils BUT they are in remote wooded areas.    Peace and Quiet   After cleaning the dishes job and I left for someplace quiet to write at around 10:10 in the evening. We tried satrbucks but it closes at 10 and we got there at 10:19. so instead we went to dunkin donuts. Which was 24/7. We got alot of work done cause it was so peaceful and quiet.   We left at 12:30. I went directly to bed while job caught up with some computer stuff

       Moving around to much and too hot to practice   I can't work out until 6 in the evening which is the equivalent of 4 o'clock back at the phils. I am unusually taned being well baked in all usually exposed areas. I wish there was a place i can even all my tans... it just looks wierd. I am twice the as dark as when i came from the phils... unusual eh.    Drawing   Forgot to bring the scanner with me. I'll make sure i bring it around with me where ever i go. Ill draw tonight... if i can find a place like a coffee shop that is open till midnight.    Plans for the new house   Just planning to recycle all the boxes into trash cans and laundry hampers. All i need is to put plastic over them, $6 paint spray (perferably a color that stands out) and some newspaper. Leave em to dry and viola my containers.   i forgot what was that cheap brand of furniture... IkEA!!! Even though your the one assembling the price is worth it. Stuff back home is cheaper... too bad furniture here dont cost as much... but i guess it will have to do.    Saving up for school  As a waiter and assuming i spend half of my money that will leave me with $500 a month... school costs $800 dollars a semester. So i guess i will have to save up for a 2 year course 2grand... thats eight months of work. not bad. back home unless you study in UP if you work your tuition goes up. If you studied in UP you CAN afford you tuition.   Its as "if your down will push you down farther" mentality     ARMOR SMITHING  Learning to make armor right now. According to this really nice website   http://www.arador.com   they not only give the how but where to buy (at least an idea) these materials.   According to the site the equipment i need to start are the ff:  Adjustable locking pliers or "vice grips" $7 $5 bent noste needlenose pliers $5-$15 clips (varying in kind cost and quality) $1 per lbs or $50 for 50lbs of Galvanized steel wire $3 Steel dowel or pipe 3ft long 6/8"   $80 for all of it... + possibly a week to find the materials.   Plans   I plan to make the following things:    1- Using fake leather...     make my own boots    Layered and Padded leather armor      2- Maille over shirt    3- Padded practice swords perferably a 4.5ft sword(bastardsword) and a 3.5ft sword(shortsword). As well as weighed practice sticks.     4- Encumberance training armor. Using rag cloths carrying sand or other weights for an encumberance of 40lbs.

       Wish list  If i had to go back to school what would i take?  Law enforcement   As an artist Law enforcement would not give me time to draw or work. Its just that i wanted to live the dream of being able to protect others. If i could I would take law enforcement but not be a police officer... if i could be a registered detective i would.   We're still at south jersey as mom went to so much shoping she decided to postpone going back to chirstine's place.   I have dreams where i am a detective often. I know that i wont be a good detective but being able to be skilled in the general practice is a practice in vigilance.   why did i bring it up?   Gloucester, the county we are moving to offer's it in their community college. I don't need to take an arts course anymore given that i learned all that i can. I'm just musing at the thought.    Gino and Kath  (and the highschool barkada back home... ton2, rj, rico and ej etc. -i hope i didnt forget anyone) Hey you guys i hope your doing fine. I'll post in Kaths comments often to keep in touch :D

       The Devil Again  Christine trying to use us is old news but she seems so villain like in her efforts that i wish there was a super hero who can show her real motive in my mom's eyes.    Recent Villain Activities   She's saying her appartment was dirty and she is frustrated by it. She is trying to get us in ill favor so that mom will force us to be with her or listen to her.    Explaination   It wasnt dirtied. She dirtied it again by her own untidy and irresponsible lifestyle. it my word against hers... and mom's swish cheesed and biased memory.    Counter Move   Well nothing... By the time mom leaves we should be able to move in. Either way me and the guys will go to the south to wait out the hous's availabily.   Villainous Titas   In the life of the Jaquinos and Candy there is no end to bad guys and they come in the for of my titas. ever since we got here my titas look at us as free labor. They have been bidding my mom for candy and jasper offering her stuff to have them in their house to clean, babysit and take out the trash.   Me and Jobert being the "lazy" ones dont get the hassle. Which is great but our bad rep puts everything we do in suspicious light. ITs ok since we dont need them and dont care. BUT MOM cares... until she leaves.   Avoiding these nasty villains is another hurdle in our ever complicating lives. The user titas all plan to make suprise visits. They want to gossip and ruin us for our mom to feel better for themselves.... cause now mom might be a multi-millionaire. YEP the crab mentality exists far across the shores.   IF a sibling had good fortunes there was dignity in showing that you can take care of yourself. Not in my mom's family. I heard my titas used to steal from each other and backstab each other when they are younger. Nothing much has changed in the years.  Scary... huh... my mom's side is full of pit vipers... a sister evil dimwit and the circumstance of joblessnes.   Still I am in the states. Thats the only good thing. Here i can choose to disappear once i save up and never see them again. Its that simple. the opportunity is always worth the effort.    New House  Mom being a banker... like a woman i am crazy about... knows he loopholes and the cost cutting edges of comercial banking. My mom is now extending her buy and rent out scheme to here in the states. Scary but cool. In 4 years she would have doubled her worth in dollars with this business.   Not that i will dip into it. My only intention with family wealth is purely for emergencies. I'm not planning to get any of the money... cause as soon as someone starts handing cash out people will start barking how much they deserve. I hate that how money makes people less human. I'd rather die of poverty than a bitter struggle who desreves what.  I know how those dynasties rise and fall... heck with no one with enough brains to pilot the wealth after my parents retire nothing good will happen to it... Only one person has the know how and "greed" for that money.   Candy  Yep... candy will continue the wealth of the family while me and the guys dissappear and later disassociate. I know full well how money can drive some families loco. And how much some people need the ego boost.  lets face it... christine is an idiot. I used to do her homework for her at highschool AND college. All SHE USED TO HAVE was looks... now shes whoring herself to some guys for favors and possibly commitment.   Yes i'm smiling inside.   She wont go far... having stepped on so many people, she has no real friends and no real comfort in her life in the future. She will take it out on her kids (i pitty them). She is just too high in her mighty chair to realize how much she needs to work on important technicall skills as marketing is a whoring industry where they freshest and youngest make it.

      I was able to talk to my chat this morning. But alas... it all had to end.    Thinking Long time  I went to Echelon Mall where i spent $7 on a cold cut sandwich which wasnt as good as the ones i order in WaWa but ok enough. I should have asked for more spicy mustard, horse radish.   Well i got to drawing. Starting with excersizes drawing people who passed by. Drawing their faces as well as i could with just a glance and their bodies.   In a country with so much obese people a person from a 3rd world country like me would get an impression that there are alot of gluttons out there. Who am i to judge, when media here and sewsawing moral and ethical attitudes drive people to find some source of comfort and take it in heavily... be it eating, sex, hobbies or just plain old money. Like my experiences in UP. What i see when i look around is the extreems people can be. While back home it more of the extreems of poverty.   Despite this footnote it wasn't this that occupied my mind most of that afternoon.  There was the problem with the job again. With no experience working blue colar and with white colar jobs knowledge being limited and that I really think it will be a long and jobless 5 months. My only salvation is the new computer and old training programs of my old school skills.   If tonton can get me those disks we were talking about i can practice and build a resume. In 5 months i can do something. And if no-one bothers me it can be a lot.    Training Jasper  Well those programs can be put to good use with jasper. I mean jasper suffering jobless ness and a life he may not further enjoy to the fullest what better way to turn the balance if i teach him 3d graphics...  Not that i am an expert but its just i know the basics and i know where to find what he needs to know.    Self Training  Teaching my self to draw again and draw fast is hard but i think i can relearn what i lost in the past years i stopped drawing. I guess thats the problem with MMA i didnt have time to draw. What is an arts course if i stopped drawing.   I guess if i had the means I would not need a college degree. I know what i needed to finish. Its a magna opus. One great work to base my port folio in. Gino gave me the means already and with some time i can finish the pages i need. I have it all... Its just that i don't have a place to work. I can't work at christine's nor can i work at south jersey where there is no space for me.   I would have to stay in the new house at jersey city. I would have to work quietly in the basement where me and jasper can sit down in a small cramped table and work. I hope i get ton2 package in time.  Heck if i can teach jasper to be an artist that would be cool. Jasper is hard working and thats most of being an artist, there is also honest appraisal. Hearing what you don't want to hear but what you need to hear.   Current conditions  Its cramped here at jobert room. I can't draw given the heat of the day. I bet it would be much worse in winter. I guess i have to gain weight. But with no place to burn and build muscles i guess the north is the only place i have to be.   Its ok if i don't see job or jas (if they stay south). I need to do this and I don't have much of a choice. Living and working without them had been something i got used to and lived by back at the philippines when they both went ahead of me to the states.   I just hope no body bothers me... christine the devil i'm sure will try to ruin me though.   Christine the Devil   My oldersister is a total hoar. Selling her soul to the highest bidder and being such a hippocrite she uses people with no remores. She implacted me and my siblings as lazy and worthless to gain favor with my parents . Favor i care nothing for but causes my parents to use us unfairly, thus she controls us indircetly through my parents.   She would say: "i'm such a neat freak and you guys are making me stressed out"  counter clue - 1 her car is such a mess there is no room to sit except for the driver. How can she mean that.  - her place when we first arrived WAS discheveled, there was no real evidence that she was tidy.   Motive   she wants us to stay as her free personal maids. Made evident by her moves towards our mother, her pitty tactics, flattery, and her evident "use" of us to clean up after HER mess when she is entertaining guests.   My evil sister... the girl who used to steal from mom (and mom forgot all about it). Who never got punished and the REAL total drop out.     Her plan   Once we move she will take the garage... which is half of the first floor (basement like conditions)... the space relegated to me and jasper. Unfortunately... I will be still her maid.   I wont clean up after that irresponsible, cock sucking, ass fucked, hoar. She will use pitty tactics and all to get us to do stuff for her. let all the guys she asks favors for fuck her.    Counter Manuever   Well there is avoiding her given that there will be 3 floors. I wont go up for dinner since i have my own fridge i can cook for myself and jasper. And I KNOW HOW TO COOK.    To end  So hopefully in the months that follow with just one computer between me and jasper. I can teach him to be a 3d graphic artist and i can make the comic that gino and i first planned to make, design my d20 system in the philippines setting AND beef up for the winter months.

      Job is still asleep... He must have been reading terry goodkind till the break of dawn... What a waste of time since we didn't get much work done since yesterday... he should use his reading time to get rid of those waiting periods between work.   Of course there is nothing i can say to his face about it. Its 4:30 and he hasnt done anything since yesterday. I wish i had a way to get my liscence... but that wont be till the next 5 months. Getting a job is another thing...   5 months...  i thought that would easily be eaten up by basic training. But i could use the time to draw and stuff... there is a soccer field nearby... I'll go there at around 6 and practice my kicks.   I wish i would be allowed to stay here with tita and not have to go to north jersey. I wish i could find a job.  Looking at my life i don't have it that bad though... Paolo is a good example of not being let down even when the odds are grossly against his favor...   and he does it all by being true to himself and being cool. He works when he has too and parties as hard as he can when its all done. I never cease to admire that guy. He can make his cake and eat it.

      I was able to web cam with chat again. :D yay! At least once a week is a good enough frequency till I get a better internet connection. I miss her so much i got a freaky dream. Its a good and twisted sign I guess of being obsessed about my gf from this distance.    Another Weird Dream  I dreamed there was this kid who was out having fun. Its supposed to be the far future and he didn’t know his fun would lead to dangerous consequences for the whole world.  I was like a ghost, a silent observer to all that was happening. The kid as out partying and his car was stolen. When his car was stolen he was able to catch the car-jacker with his guard down. The wrestled control of the car and he “gingered” or whipped it in a way that he fell out surviving the crash and the car-jacker careened into high way tunnel dangerously near a nuclear power plant.  It was at the same time that the government was unstable and that opponents of a stable government was looking for an excuse to topple the current leaders.  The kid wandered into a hospital. Security was on a red alert as the accident escalated into a disaster. The car exploded where as it’s explosion was too close to what was a red security zone which already had problems.  The kid was trying to hide his wounds and scars. He was washing the blood of the guy out of his clothes. It was supposedly against the law because they needed forensic evidence of how all the events came to be.  Eventually he was caught. And he confessed what happened. He even confessed that he didn’t know if he really meant to kill the guy when he whipped the car into that speed. Somehow, that made things a little better. The higher ups were directly engaged in the matter and after studying the kids testimony found a way to lessen the damage, but they had to act fast.  One of them (the higher ups) was already dying and his “friends” knew this. They planned to have some one, another supposedly good guy, replace the old guy who wont live through night in one move along with the move to block their enemies from taking advantage of their weekend state.  I was supposed to be an engineer. I was with chat and we have been together for only a year. It was a short time after being so far apart. It was supposedly up to me and my other colleagues. One guy had a daughter he was worried about, the other guy had still his whole life ahead of him.  Chat was always my partner in these dreams. She was also an engineer (I guess it establishes how far fetched the dream is). There was this problem with fixing the plant at its given state, there was a time limit and in a like scheduled manner was lethal at a given time. The guy who had a daughter’s wife died just yesterday fixing it. It seemed that it was meant to us to fix everything or die trying. It was so bleak, everything looked old and forgotten. The powerplant had little light coming through what windows it had… like raid continued to pour outside. Me and Chat had to make a decision bigger than ourselves on the word of these men in power, who I could not completely trust. I was thinking we should just run away, this problem should not be ours to deal with. I wanted to choose life, but there was no one else who was going to do it. This friend of mine lost his wife to the radiation and this guy with no future is going to. “Why can’t he stay for his daughter?” was going through my head  I guess it dawn on me now that his daughter will not be able to escape the blast. So it was us and the ancient powerplant. I saw the kid, he was so sorry for all the trouble he caused, I could not blame him cause it was all an accident. I could have been the kid and I would have hated all this crap to be on my shoulders.  Two friends, Chat and I went inside the power plant. We were working on it trying to fix it on time. I remember how intense it felt because it was both Chat and I manning the booth behind the isotopes. The two other guys were in their suits trying fighting against time to fix it. Chat stumbled into the recording of the guy’s wife. She had enough time to get out in the video which recorded her final moments. She didn’t go out? I was puzzled why she didn’t go out? She was working desperately to beat the flash or radioactivity that goes through the plant every once a day. She could have given up and left… yet she didn’t go out.  We saw everything turn red as the alarms went off. It was time and we didn’t have enough of it. We should leave now but if we do, the plant wont get fixed. It was a mystery what keeps this ancient juggernaut working.  So we made the decision to stay. They were chat’s friends too and we knew there was nothing out there if we left but waiting for death in some other manner, unlike fighting it today.  When the radiation flash happened I could not breathe and all the light in the room brightened to a blinding white. I was beside chat and we bother felt ourselves fall with the same feeling you feel on a rollercoaster ride. When it all happened, we didn’t feel pain or have a lingering death. It was instantaneous and strange.  We found ourselves still in the plant… its seemed to be at night and everything closed up. We tried to go out but the doors are locked and the windows indestructible. It was taking us a while to realize that we might just be ghosts trapped here. I was shuddering at the thought, at least I’m with chat… to bad you cant have kids and raise a family when your dead. Too bad the scenery will be this factory for ever.  Then the oddest thing happens, the doors open in the morning of the next day. The wife of our friend is there to greet us. And we walked outside the plant to where other people are “going” to work. I didn’t understand… these faces I saw were those who died working in the plant prior to us. All of them, and they seemed like it was just another day at work. Their expressions were that of understanding and happiness. They had that pat in the back for a job well done, but you don’t know what you did?  The wife of our friend was about to explain what happened when I woke up from the noise of street cleaners. I could not continue the dream after wards.   Looking Back  The boy said something like: “you cant say you will overcome temptation till you’ve encountered it” not that insightful but strangely something I should remind myself of. The temptation is really strong when it presents itself even when you have given your word… I usually close my eyes and shrug it off. The mistake there is that I should understand why I am not going to let my self fall into it.  “What is the cost of falling?” is the lesson to be learned from what he said.  Lesson from the dream… its scary but it was like a precept if I was in that situation. Honestly, if it was up to me, I would buy the first ticket for me and chat out of the fall out radius. I was looking back at the effects of that kind of explosion, the one in Chernobyl, I realized that those people who we (me and chat in the dream) we walked in their shoes in were rewarded and there was a happy ending for them. Its like glimpsing their heaven.  I guess I failed to realize that everything was in secrecy and nobody was warning the people about the plant’s failure.  I could feel it already leaving my memory... its hard to hold on to a memory of a dream.

      Blog Update 8-11-04   Chat  I just missed chat yesterday: Missed, in the sense that I wasn’t able to talk to her when she was available. I wish I was able to figure out that my internet problem sooner. I’m beginning to think something, like a curve of natural disasters have come to make sure that it is a virtual challenge to communicate with each other. I hate the fact that I am the one without internet. I don’t like it when the circumstance can make me seem distance. I don’t like making excuses. When I find myself in this predicament I find it embarrassing that things didn’t move smoothly and what happened was not what I meant to happen.   Going to the South  In the south things will change. I hope I get a job quickly. I am open to anything as long as I have a chance to study it and practice it. I am not that good in a lot of things and I have so many things to do and skills to master. I also hope to get a bike instead of a car. I don’t mind cars, but job has one and we will get a van; I would like a bike for myself. Budget: $150.    Stupid Internet  I didn’t know when my computer lost its dial tone when it dials for AOL. It was a weird puzzle to solve. I used to pick up the phone and make sure there was a dial tone and the computer became free to dial up. Now, I think I have to pick it up at the same time as it begins to dial up.    Health  I need running shoes. I don’t have any other shoes except my boots, soccer shoes (for indoor and outdoor) and sandals.   Drawing.  I haven’t been drawing lately. I guess I should. But I need blood to be circulating around my legs for me to get things done. I guess I can walk to the park with soccer shoes with me. But I don’t have a car.  I hope to remember that if mom and dad aren’t planning anything I should take the van and visit the park to get some running done. Or better is to get my hands on some running shoes. I have a $20 limit, cause I don’t have any money.   Food  I was cooking and I really need to have a larger variety of ingredients. When I start controlling the kitchen I will start creating pre minced and packed ingredients.  I was cooking the burgers and I was amazed to so see how much oil comes from a single one. In the end of the cooking I filled a small bowl purely of the burger’s own oils. Yuck, I guess I am beginning to smell bad these days cause of the amount of oils, dark meats, and spices I have been eating. I was better of eating in Subway everyday or in Wawa. I lean cold cuts, counting calories, and regular exercise was the norm till money ran low.     Internet Again  Candy found a hobby. Using the computer speakers and the phone to create an echo of her "weeee...." and her "pooo pooo"...

      Blog update 8-10-04  I feel like Preaching (so you don’t have to read this part)  I had a weird dream with no relation to real life. I as was in a world where there were these traps and I had to be a little athletic to evade and dodge. There were these test that I was required to go through. It was annoying given that it felt like college and tests again.  I think I have a fear of going back to college and starting all over again. I guess I really have to prove to myself that I am made and that I have all I need. The world around me needs the diploma. I need to prove to myself that all I need is to be as good in art as I am close to being.  Anyway, I overheard mom talking trash about us again. I guess there is nothing different about what she says from what I already suspect. I don’t mean to sound like a sore-son but I really do not care (if I did I would enumerate what she said). If she was praising me, that meant for me to kiss her old sagging ass. I don’t want to spend my life sucking up to someone who does not share my same philosophies and ideals.  My parents are slow to know when I am (actually me and jobert) are being sarcastic. Not to mention how poor is our opinion of them given how I compare them to other parents. Yes, I do compare them to other parents. What parents do I compare them with, well with those of friends and the like.  I guess the greatest gift my parents ever gave me is that I hate them so much. My ideals, My personality is shaped by how I would not become them or be anything like them. In some strange paradox, I think If I had a good relationship with my parents I would have been held back.  Christine is an example of having “faked” her way through everything. So she’s a whore now. I guess seeing what she was becoming after our parents raised her the same way they did us… it comes quite clear that until they see their parenting ability for what it really is, they will be delusional as they are religious. I guess when your truly evil and a religion keeps telling you God forgives and massages your conscience in the way it does for Jv, my parents and a lot of the aristocratic trash in the Fils, then you know its bad.  Well, in my case… I guess if I look at my flaws… I should be ashamed… but unlike my parents. I listen and give others another chance. I don’t judge to quickly (cause I know I’ve done that to other people unfairly and they have proven me wrong). I also keep a keen eye out for the details that matter.  If they only focused on accepting people as they are and loving them for them, learning to see their strengths and accept it with their short comings. They would be better people in my book. I know this as the pillar of the problems we have with my parents. It is a pillar supported by the catholic church and especially by opus dei.  If your not catholic then I will tell you that my parents think you will go to hell, and that they are better than you, they think of you as something to tolerate and belittle. Understand that I do not believe in that. You should hear my mom talk about christine’s jewish bf. I swear I would be shouting at her lack of humanity for talking crap about his faith and decisions.  For a woman who never made her own decisions about her spirituality. She just blindly follows the church and her logic is twisted by it. She says I’m illogical when I argue in debate terms.  For her lack of respect for other people’s rights and decisions I am embarrassed by her. I hate how the catholic has become a cult  as its traditions and methods become something of superstition and my mother is one of those old crones that supports them.  Kari Lopes’s grandmother is cool. She is one of the leading atheists and a prestigious artist in the Philippines. I’m agnostic and unlike an atheist I believe a god exists or what could be a pantheon of them. What I do have in common with that line of thinking is the choice of how to accept one’s reality.  I don’t like depending on the catholic church for my charities, neither do I want them to sell me indulgences (which is still done today at the Vatican) relative to my wealth.  I may respect all religions, but when it comes to the examples where they affect more than just personal belief and are used as a means by those who draw power from it I don’t need to explain further. If you can read through the politics of religion you will see that people manipulate what God says or means like a stringed puppet to get what they want, which can be power, wealth, and revenge.  The world cannot do without religions though. But at least the politics behind religion should be eliminated. Like the south and slavery, religion is a way of life and it will not go gently into the night now that those who were hurt unjustly by its actions cast a new light to what it is.  Man I’m preachy in the morning (I just woke up but its around 2:01pm).   Chat Chat must be asleep. I keep telling my self that work will make the waiting go by faster. I hope she wakes up ok. She was still sick from catching it from her brother. She tells me they share food. Well that’s ok, I do too with my brothers and sisters. I’ll try to wake her up later for work. I hope she can take a break or something. I feel like she needs a recharge, like something exciting. I wish I was there. I would take her out to tagaytay for the week end. She can meet Patrick and trisha and maybe henry. I can prepare a little study of tagaytay from someone who might now it well enough to tell me the points of interests. I also have my tagaytay highlands card. A rip roaring adventure in the Starex with a couple of friends would be great, memorable and ideal. Well just thinking of it feels recharging for me. :D  Exercise. I got to work but I don’t have shoes to work out in. Maybe if I run in my indoor soccer shoes. I hope I don’t break the spikes or the rubber spikes can take it. I should work out at around 5am. I’ll run to the park, around it, and back. I should bring some water with me though.  About Dad Job made me realize that no one in the company listens to dad, despite his position (cause he can be spazed most of the time). I think people started loosing respect for him when he sounded like a raving lunatic… and he didn’t exhibit leadership qualities.  He was like the average lugnut in school he keeps making stupid quips. You don’t get a lot of respect for that kind.  Internet there is a problem with internet again. This time i solved it by having to pick up the phone while the computer dialed for internet. Wierd huh?! anyway...  Game Ran a game for job, jas and candy. DId fine... almost killed candy... but all in all it was pretty good. Its preperation when i start GMing again.

      Blog Update 8-9-04    Well I had a dream… although I ‘m not sure what it was. What felt like de ja vu was the fact that Chat told me she was sick. The dream was a bit saddening but I don’t remember what it was about. I’m hoping that it was not some forecast of misfortune.  I hate it that I don’t get so much internet these days. I don’t know what I can do till I earn. Then there is the problem with a job again. I just hope the Wawa nearby when we move.   Being so far away I feel well useless and powerless that I can’t be back home. It makes me think of the choices I made. Like staying in UP. I think about it now and if I stayed maybe I would have fared better or graduated by now. I was batch 99 in UP. I would have been done by now and heck… I would have been able to pay for my own tuition.  The problem I faced then was that it was a leap of faith. It was a leap of faith to take care of myself in UP. I thought about the people I met there and that they were good people. They would have been the kind I could see hard time thru. It was me bailing out.  I don’t think I am able to see a crossroad like such if it hit me in the face. The sooner I get better in art the sooner I can make my own web presence with it. I am just to nit picky and unsure at times.  Its 12:AM so that makes it 8-10-04. Mom is making caleos. The house stinks from the smell of it.  I made tita su-like sinangag today. I got the garlic, oil, and the right moisture. It was a success now the problem is getting tapa or chorizo.

      Sorry i've been out, The internet connection is having a problem cause it uses a long distance number. I maxed out 300 minutes. I don’t know how it worked so I had to figure it out again how to fix my internet so it wont use up 6 cents per minute and I already used 300 minutes. That means I already ran up a 1000 peso bill.  Anyway parent troubles and stuff... like you never hear enough of that from me.

      Its Thursday 1:56pm. Chat must be asleep. I would only start sleeping earlier I guess if I had email and knowing I can chat or email her.  Again I hear that I am a lazy and irresponsible son. Its almost everyday I hear that, not because I am its just when my parents don’t get what they want. It’s so Filipino when they do things and assume immediately that it is for the benefit of all as they have not even asked what other people think.  Honestly, my opinion about them suing our neighbor for the dripping their air conditioning moisture on our property and causing it to moss, is not a good example or neighborliness demeanor we would want to set. I think they should research a bit about it or ask around at least. C’mon think about it. We are in a new land and all the laws are different. People here get sued a lot and the fact that a lot of people make a living out of twisting logic around into their favor, you would want to be defensive instead of going gun ho into a possible conflict.  Of course who am I but the voice of reason and the person with the “worst” logic. Strangely my parents aren’t as wise as they seem. Anyway as a believe of “you so what you reap” I hope they get what they deserve. My parents are beginning to look like dinosaurs everyday with their outdated methods and excess drama.  My mom is such a drama queen. I have lost all respect for her.  I can’t wait to move to the south, get a job, save up and leave, Something that has been delayed for 7 years (by American standards, early by 5 years by Philippine’s). I will survive it despite my designs or what I am used to. I will adapt and do well. I can’t help it anyway if I want them to shut up then I better leave. I don’t care about them.  The thing about playing, or living, right and fair is that if you lose, you lost nothing. Just go onto infinity. I think hell lies in regret or when you lose your way or dignity. Things like having a good name, doing what you can, and making a little difference is what a person’s going to be faced with at the last moments of his life. Well that’s what I think. I don’t like to preach. I’m just saying what goes through my mind in terms of divine punishment.  For me an evil person is just another path… to an end that I guess suits him. I usually feel that the criminal inbound could easily be me. It depends in how you would want to go down as. For me evil serves a purpose (yeah from a guy who GMs all the time) as a challenge or something to be vigilant about. So I don’t see it so much as an alien nature that should not be here but part of it (human nature).  To much discovery which studies evil and anthropology.

      I’m going crazy not talking to chat what feels like an entire week. It’s driving me nuts and edgy all the time. I miss her so much. Given what had happened to me (or what almost happened to me) I miss her even more and have a much stronger resolve to see through adapting to what maybe more trouble than I am ever going to be prepared for.  I learned a lot talking to those kids. Ads here in America are scarier than back in the Phils because they are ready to make outrageous claims and have twisted logic to back it up. Some people here make it a living to sue other people with just the most miniscule of faults. Its never about negligence, its about “rights” which have become to complicated and to unreasonable to understand. I guess if I were to go to school again, I would study to be a lawyer. Every time I think of laws and rules I think of Rick. He is one of the people I admire greatly. I learned from him is that, you never think about how bad or flawed the rules are… but how you can turn it to your favor. That kind of thinking and with a genius IQ, Rick would have been a contender in the politics and underworld of the Philippines. It’s just that he was raised by his father’s strong sense of principles and incorruptible character.  It scares me when I think about those kids. It was like a nightmare and I was talking to the devil himself. But he was in the form of these kids who were raised to sell anything they have for the piece “the man” tells them they want.  Slim, this scrawny and malnourished 14 year old who looks like he’s ten impressed me and showed me how it can be to be desperate and how money is the mana from heaven all the rappers and tv is preaching.  This experience just reinforces why I hate hip hop (eminem specially) in how they sing about getting even and telling each other how important it is to sell out. We were poor, poorer than these kids when we were growing up (given how much welfare america hands out). People I know from the tracks, from the slums, and from more miserable parts of my country have a better sense of worth than these kids.  It’s just plain scary, how they look at you and just drool for what ever change you have at your wallet. I bet if I had $50 I could ask these kids to do anything. Hell just $20, or the so much heard about $2.  When I ran, I ran with my legs shaking from the pot running through my system, I stopped. I knew the pot was my undoing given that my reflexes were not as good, and my strength was lost. I was thinking of turning around and fighting. Only to see them just leave me alone.  I was ready to fight and lose. I was thinking I would fight but I would make them sorry they even tired. All the courage was gone, all the heroism I built up for myself gone, all I was then was just a pathetic and high little Asian against large black kids in a neighborhood with drug dealers across the tall walls of grass from across the playground.  Its weird and I think about it If I ever fought, I should never have let my guard down. I should have never been high. In fact I should work on every muscle I have to kick the sorry ass of any other person who ever try me for my money.  Guns, bizkit, jo’s friends who are in the army tells us how a 22mm is the best they can get on the streets. Bizkit says that he’d shoot himself with a 22mm. 22mm, I would shame my ancestors and my place of birth in san juan hill if I fell and cowed to such a gun. Joromentados would only be stopped by shot guns and the advent of the 45 caliber automatic pistol.  I miss chat so much. I don’t have internet right now. Its annoying how mom is sabotaging my attempts to get internet. She is doubly a bitch in my book. The only thing I do now to piss her off is really not to listen when she whines. Its like blah blah… and I just leave the room like I have something better to do. Fuck her, I was so pissed at here I got the bed they were planning to throw out, strung it up and used it as a hitting board for my stick practice. Hitting it till my skin ripped at the base of my fingers. I guess I should say tear cause that’s all that happened. I was careful not to do too much damage given that I need to wear it often enough to callous.  It’s a different life here in the states. I guess one has to be ever vigilant about who wants to use who. Vigilance is a virtue that I really need to work on. Trusting is easy, lets face it, if it wasn’t then I guess religion would not be in business. Trust and Faith goes hand in hand.  It’s sucks not learning to be suspicious and always testing and probing. That’s why I guess Patrick is a scientist and I didn’t have that. I admit when I look back, I broke all my toys simply was curious to look at how it worked but I was never keen enough to put them back together. When Gino told me about his dad assembling radios, I remembered when I tried to do that when I was a kid. Dad’s factory was still in our house in san juan, and I was bored and had no more toys to destroy. They thought I could handle a radio, until I did not understand squat in the piece of paper (I wish there was someone as childish as me and I would have explained it in a way I could have understood) which was supposed to be the plans for a radio meant for beginners. I fucked up so they gave me something easier, a mosquito repellant. It’s supposed to emit an annoying sound that mimics the male mosquito and drives the females away (it must be a geek mosquito talking about the game last night). So I built it but it was unimpressive as I myself knew at that time.  I also miss the guys. I remember Henry and his father Motombo and Baron Zamedi (voodon god of death). Trisha tell henry that the RPers here have nothing on him. I haven’t met a RPer who can match him in theatrical ability here in the con and events we have seen.  Henry one time carried a conversation between two of his characters interchanging at half breath: It was father Motombo, a Jamaican caltholic priest and Baron Zamedi, voodon god of death. It was just amazing how fast he switched accents and personalities so fast like flicking a switch on and off.  Or the time Henry weirded out this guy who came from Canada in an Innomine Game (where gelo was trying to keep the spot light as the GM). Innomine is a gritty and shades of gray game about angels and devils as they are just individuals part of an eternal war. He played a cab driver who was based on Chiech marines (he’s the small round Mexican guy in the comedies) he played an angel (remember that angels are genderless) who was hitting on a mortal soldier of hell (supernaturally talented and strong mortals who aid hell). It was spectacular when the guy just jumped out of his seat and ran laughing into the open grass beside the shaded area we were playing cause he found it so funny. Henry was just being Henry and he’s tamed himself after coming from college people.  Its when you got this steely soldier of hell pissing in an empty mens room with five other urinals you’d raise your brows in disbelieve when this small, fat, greasy Mexican cab driver walks over to piss beside you and compliments you about your ass. Saying “a good as like that is a strong sign of virility and masculinity” and when you show your badge (he was a cop) he says he does your sergeant who happens to be an old, fat, pasty, homophobic Italian geezer.  With that the table was laughing at the magic that was henry just being natural. We don’t see that anymore these days given how hard at work keeping the school afloat. I wish I can help him. Given that if he needed a place to stay (and I had even a little) he can crash with the jaquinos anytime.  Anyway its 4am on a Wednesday. I am listening to mandy moore, the walk to remember song. I know pat loved this song (and mandy too given that of all the teen singers she did not sell out) since it was about the love and the stars.  I heard the book was great… luckily I have my own kick ass love story so I don’t think I’m missing much.  I finished the buffalo wings (cause they were the spiciest American food I could find). I was able to make my ground pepper in olive oil. I heated it up, put mozzarella garlic and put it in tortilla wraps with American cheese slices. Viola: I made spicy cheese quesadillas. Spicy being the key word.  A day ago I spent 2hr 30min talking to Jack, the dell customer support guy who was so much like me in the sense that he is thousands of miles from home, just out of college and 25. Amazing, my sister could not believe my temperament as she was being a bitch to this guy and I was being so nice. It’s the best I can do since I may be talking to a Filipino given that Indians and Filipinos have a lot in common. I mean, 3rd world country with a high literacy rate, not to mention that they are English speaking and a source for outsourcing of American labor.  I made a friend the same day I met these kids of the “hood”. It’s cool given that my being open and friendly was put to good use. I think about it, being friendly can go a long way given that it gives everybody a more pleasant environment to live in.  I believe that “evil” itself, the force that shaped those kids are from those people who are wickedly black hearted knowing sow this “need” to those who are too young or forgotten to know better. These kids may have never had the opportunity to be helped out by an adult. I wish I could be a teacher given if I could help them… but that’s not my battle till destiny/fate/God really means me to tackle it. I don’t mind going to such a neighborhood to teach if no one else will. Its like an army thing if you think about it… instead of recruiting soldiers why not recruit more teachers willing to teach and give the time and day to these kids.  Wow… be a teacher or a lawyer… Teacher is more plausible… but who would be the good lawyer to protect me? In everything everybody has a role… I wonder if I meet someone who will protect me from such legal booby traps. I could be the teacher… a soldier against ignorance and since I have the patience (my parents was amazed I was willing to talk for 2:30 hours to a total stranger of a different culture etc. just for the comp… In my friendster account I placed there that I would befriend anybody who wants to be a friend… I’m friends with paolo aint I-jk paolo) deal with these kids ( if I ever plan to have my own and want to be a good partner I better learn that virtue- as I would want people to be patient with me).  Differences and acceptance, hmmm I think I got down that pretty well. Chat and I were talking about this and realized that key principles are where borders should lie, everything else could be (and in my preference should be) different. I would not want chat to go into gaming unless she really wanted to not just cause I was her bf. Although as an example of a Roleplayer I can impress given that I am schooled in the art by Henry and have the keen rules mastery, table diplomacy and wit to dominate in a given table to impress her in how RPing can be if done by a “professional”.  I know its fun and all, but what’s a little competition and theatricals to enhance the experience.  Too bad It would be a long time (a day is still too long) before we see each other in person again. At least the computer provides sight, sound and written words of how much we care for each other.  I feel like I must say something to her everyday. Its not like a duty or obligation, more like an addiction, a craving that wont be sated, by just seeing her on the webcam. Holding her, her scent that she is near me, and that look she gives me when she looks into my eye. I’m not kidding about how she looks at me, like its saying “Justin” like she is examining if I’m really there!?! I don’t get it sometimes… Sometimes I tend to hug her or keep holding her hands it must be annoying. I find touch as a constant reminder, I cant keep looking at her “kase” or less I might rip on something.  Ok I’m now playing “mercy mercy me”.  God I’m old. I’m a quarter of a century. I promised myself I would be somewhere, someone and very important by the time I’m 30. I don’t think I will be that. I will be lucky to be at where Henry is at, looking at how stressed he is, I don’t mind being where he is.   ….   Robert Palmer: I didn’t mean to turn you on.  I must have been 6 when this came out? How old are these songs? I remember going to tennis practice when I was just 8 and it was still the eighties. I remember the biggest piece of advice the tennis instructor gave me: “ look at the ball”. Forced my self to stop closing my eyes and I began hitting it. Funny, how a kid’s mind works and how those same impulses can still be felt despite years and years of athletic experience.

      Mom reprimanded me for not being responsible. How did I feel, nothing, not even regret or guilt. Why should I feel such when I feel her trample over everything I care about. I sound like a teenager. I guess a teenager is any adult locked up with their parents with out any earning power.  It’s that simple, I don’t respect them or care. There is nothing about reaching out that would help. As popey would say: “I have taken’s enough and I can’t take’t no more.”. To bad I have nothing to escape with but my work which is suffering as I feel like such an empty well. Dry and milked for all the inspiration and wonder it can give.  4:39 am later I would go to Newport mall and buy another wire and a wire to wire connection. 50ft should be enough to connect this room to the living room floor. I can’t count on cable internet since I would have to wait till Friday and I don’t want to owe Christine anything.  I’m going down slowly. I cant take being away from the internet given that I usually find a lot of things to do, given that I have a blog and I love putting little details about what I do for the sake of remembering and times I read my blog to remember how it was and what was going through my mind.  I guess when I get a job I will have to limit my internet time to an hour every two days. Given that I will excersize at least 30mins worth.  Hmmm… things I should do  9 hours sleep (just in case I oversleep) 30 mins of work out 30 mins of internet updating and writing 30 mins of game preparation 1:30 hour of meals 2 hours of wasted time that I cannot control. 1 hour travel time (back forth and errands) 10 work ($40: at least!!! Please god help me get a job to get on my feet; already excluding meals)  on other days I work on my drawings keeping as much as an hour to 2 hours used on it. I assume there will be times of dead time in work… I can use to write in my notepad or sketch.  New Hobbies: Collect Comics again… specifically graphic novels. Now to find one that will catch my fancy.

      I am paranoid, delusional and high. Not in a good way. I escaped from a mugging. Ok, how stupid can you get? Well, if it’s me we’re talking about then it takes only a little stupid to get me there.  I was so pissed with my parents walked out of the house. I was walking and I was going through how I hated them so much, how I hated my predicament, and how much I wished to be with Chat. So I walked on an on up to the “the Projects”.  Eventually I found a nice place to sit down, rest my back and write all this crap I’m feeling down. That’s when a bunch of kids slammed me with coffee cups. I didn’t react to or mind. Which is to my mistake. Over here it is true that you have to be a savage to survive. They got to talking to me, there was a girl, three black boys and a small white boy. The easily befriended me, that’s me, then of course they probed me for weakness, taunting and teasing. The way they did back in high school. If there is any they tried to strike.  So they offered me a smoke and then when I was about to get high tried to make their move. When I tried to leave, Marquesa (An African sounding version of it) was telling them “Don’t do that” or “Don’t go there”. So when the biggest one and the little white boy was pushing me and asking for money I drew my pencil (which was broken) and proceeded to walk away. I know its not threatening but I told them “Don’t let me regret this experience”. When they gave up. I ran like a sissy coward. Yes Justin Aquino Ran.  But I knew that I would have to stand and fight cause I was high, out of breath, and to weak to run any farther. So I turned to find nothing but the mary jane running through my blood and making me hear and sense them. I really think they are out there when I should logically think they aren’t.  Thanks Marquesa. This is a micro example of what a lot of people go through. I know these thin wrists and frame would deal so little damage, but it’s the tenacity, pride and dignity that I am part of a sparing club, that I dream to be a bagani, and the absolute belief in the Warrior’s fight to the death and honor.  I managed to turn around it from wimp to wimp passing of as a hero.  If my name was to be defended I would die fighting. One of the few things I have left in my hollowed degree of honor.  The high is coming down now. I believe that I should have stayed and fought. By my ancestors I will die by the choice of destiny.  But I was not sure of defeat either. But isn’t that the true risk of fighting. Doing anything. And one of the reasons I get angry at my parents… the freedome for me to screw up my own life (cause it is my life) if I fail I fail with the dignity of trying and looking out for the best for the world.  Ok… the stigma of writing while being high. Slim is a small kid that I could lift with my one skinny arm, dees, Kevin and mark… or something.  Again the feeling that I dove into a cold pool hits me. Like what I did was eons ago. Like compressed time. Must be a hightened way to feel your brain compressing data and putting it far away.  I should train harder. I hope to get as much training with jobert’s group. It was bothering me that DB was hitting on candy. Not that he is… wait… he is 6 years older than her. Anyway, I better train on my own then… muscle up.  I wrote so much.  I hate those who reinforced the stereo type. Me and jasper should go to the park and train our throws and pummels. I really have a good rear end kick to get my fighting up to gear.
