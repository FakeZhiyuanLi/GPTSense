      i don't know where to go now  i'd move on but i don't know how  everytime i head down this road  i end up in this place with-  no east no west no foward no back  just an empty lonely space  just an empty lonely space   and i'm standing here, waiting here  won't you open your blind eyes  I'm standing here, waiting here  can't you see through my disguise  i'm standing here waiting here  waiting for you  standing right in front of you   you've been here a time or two  and i just smile and i just nod  and though i seem, i seem to be calm  i don't know what to do  i'm too afraid to take a step  and change the role the role i play  and though i know i'll never know  i wonder anyway   and i'm standing here, waiting here  won't you open your blind eyes  I'm standing here, waiting here  please see through my disguise  i'm standing here waiting here waiting for you  standing right in front of you   i doubt you'll ever understand  i doubt you'll ever, ever know  i doubt i'll ever give you the chance  to see these words i'd like to show  but i'm hoping that you see them  hoping that you read them  hoping that you hear this song  hoping you can prove me wrong  hoping someday you will realize   the hope in my perfectly honest lies

      Phones suck. They're intrusive. They make it hard to decipher tones and moods. Things are easily misunderstood making for unnecessary tension. The awkward phone silence is the worst of all awkward silences. You can't "be right back." People think it's rude if you don't answer the phone. People think it's rude if you don't want to talk for long and they do. People think it's rude when you call at certain times of the day. The percentage of people who actually call you back when they say they will is inexplicably low (like less than 10%). Most phones now aren't even phones, they're little video game systems or cameras or music players with telephony as an extra feature, not the other way around. Everywhere you go you hear someone's phone ringing with the latest obnoxious rap song, and although it sounds terrible, it resembles the song enough that they feel the need to let it ring 14 or 15 times before answering. Cell phone companies make things even worse. You have to sign a multi-year contract just so you only have to pay 100 dollars for a 20 dollar phone instead of 400 dollars. Switching plans is a hassle:   Customer: "Yes, hello, I'd like to switch to one of your even more complicated plans with a more abstract calling area that includes only a small area where I live but covers me in case I happen to be visiting northeast Montana."  Service Rep.: "No problem sir, the transition process should only take 19 or 20 hours of you standing there wondering what I could possibly be typing into my computer that takes so long."  Adding features such as text messaging or caller ID or voice mail is a hassle as well, and they're deceptively expensive. And no matter how many frivolous features your phone has, you're always going to see someone with that one extra feature (such as self-detonation, invisibility, low altitude flight, etc.) that puts your phone to shame, so you no longer whip out your phone in front of everyone and repeatedly open and close it hoping someone might notice its new multi-colored, glow in the dark, insect repellent, military grade titanium case with a miniature George Foreman Grill: Cellular Phone EditionÂ® built into the back. Of course all that your friends have to do to outdo your new 14 pound phone is head down to the mall and stop by one the 14,567 phone case kiosks and find the one offering the lowest financing rates. Wait, i'll be back, i've got a call...  -alex

      Did you ever wake up one day, and you know nothing is going on that day, but you shower and get ready for the day anyway? Then you call all your friends as if theres gonna be some awesome sunday afternoon party going on somewhere. Then you just sit there with your keys in your hand watching TV for hours so it looks like your just waiting to be called back before you leave for somewhere important, even though no one's going to call you. Eventually you just go someplace pointless by yourself for no other reason than to get out of the house.   Yea.... me neither...  -alex

      first, im gonna give credit to amanda f. cuz i read her blog, thought it was cool and decided to do one. i dont really care how few people read this (and trust me, few is a generous word in this case), im just tired of opening up MS Word and typing to no one whenever i have something on my mind (always). This is just a way to do some brain defecation and clean up up here. if you dont read it: awesome. if you do read it: awesome...r  ill do an actual post in a few days  -alex

      Why are bad decisions so much easier to make than good ones?  Does anyone else think R2-D2 should make an appearance in every movie ever?  If people didn't think swear words were bad, would they still be bad?  Has anyone else noticed that television has made people so lazy that we have to come up with "TV" just so we don't have to strain ourselves and say a 4 syllable word?  Am I allowed to believe in luck but not believe in the supernatural?  Who else is really annoyed by people who only like bands no one's heard of, and then when that band gets all popular these people suddenly don't like them anymore?  Are smart people good at not doing dumb stuff, or good at hiding it when they do?  How many people do you know that you can 100% percent trust and depend on in any situation, however petty or significant it is? Doesn't this number seem awfully low?  Aren't songs more fun when you don't know the exact lyrics so you just kinda make up your own?  If pennies were taken out of circulation, would the average person save money or lose money?  Can opinions be objective?  -alex

      Well the Pizza Factory went out of business today. Last night I'm working a normal shift and now suddenly I'm out of a job. Nevertheless I thought it was a really fun place to be, whether I was working or just wanted some food. I was only there for 3 or 4 months but I still met some really cool people that hopefully I'll stay friends with. AJ, Matt, Matt, Kristen, Daniella, Emma, Tracy, Ben, David, Justin: peace. It's been fun.  -alex

      The stars are always there. Sometimes we can't see them, but they're still there. They make us feel small. You can't count them, but you can try. Everytime you go through the course of a night without looking at the stars, you're missing 50% of what's going on that night. In 60 years you'll probably be in a different place, you'll look, act, feel, and think differently than you do now. The whole world will have changed, but if you look up, the night sky will look just like it did 60 years ago. There are infinite patterns, so the stars are kind of like a giant ink blot test where you can see whatever you want to see. Lets say I want to take a gander at the Andromeda Galaxy, which is the closest galaxy to the Milky Way. Andromeda is 2.2 million light years away: so you say "Wow, who cares?" After punching some numbers, Andromeda Galaxy is 13,490,400,000,000,000,000 miles away, yet I can see it with a 4.5-inch telescope. Just a thought. Star gazing is essentially time travel; what you see actually happened years and years ago. Stars are tools and toys. You can find your way around with stars. You can feel the Earth spinning when you look at the stars. They always give you something to do late at night. In many cases you can't see them if you look at them, only if you look near them. The longer you look at them, the more of them you see. Does anyone else find the night sky interesting? Maybe you should.  Look up.  -alex

      On the local news there was a segment about teenage drinking. During the piece, the reporter stated that "Teens who start drinking are more likely to become alcoholics than those who don't." Well I'll be....  -alex

      Why can't we just slide our SAT answer sheet through a computer right after we take it and get our scores right then? Is this really that far fetched?  Why don't more people watch Family Guy?  Is there anything more straining than when someone you like does something you don't like?  How do teenagers not care about voting? What if a candidate proposes college tuition cuts, or planned on cutting jobs in the field in which the teen hopes to work? Would they still not care?  Are people inherently bad at being subtle or is everyone just afflicted with a horrible lack of perception?  If you could you read people's minds, would you really want to? Think about it.  If someone was 100% percent honest and forthcoming, would anyone like them?  What color is glass? (Note: clear/transparent is not a color)  If no one had guns, would anyone need guns?  Hmmm.....  -alex

      Hey I won't post fer a few days because I'm heading up to Colorado for a little vacation and to visit the University of Colorado. I think I got my ass thoroughly kicked by the SAT II tests yesterday, but I cheered myself up by stopping by Best Buy and adding The Starting Line and the newer Something Corporate CD to my ever expanding punk/pop-punk CD collection, and by popping my awesome new Pac-Man antenna ball onto my car. Good stuff.  -alex

      Sometimes (everyday) people do or say things that I find odd (stupid), and I always wonder if other people would find these things equally as odd (stupid). If you read the situation and are like "Why is that so weird?" that's fine, maybe you just have a less cynical perspective on things than I do. I'm not going to comment on whatever the situation is, I'll just post it and see if you find people as...odd as I do.  I walk into Subway to get a meatball sub because I just filled up one of those free 6 inch sub cards. The kid behind the conter, probably my age, asks me what I want. I say "I'll take a 6 inch meatball sub on wheat." He proceeds to say "Yuck, I hate meatball subs, they're so disgusting. I don't see how anyone can eat them."  Hmmm....  -alex

      Turbulence 3: Heavy Metal. A movie about a KISS-like rock band hijacking a commercial airplane and attempting to crash it into a Kansas church in hopes to open the Seventh Gate of Hell. Just a few questions on this one. At any point during the production of this movie, did someone think "Hey, maybe this isn't going to be a very good movie." How did anyone keep a straight face while making this movie? Who has the dignity to present this idea to a movie company? What actor receives this script and says "Wow, this looks like it'll be a real blockbuster! I hope I get to be the lead singer with heavy make-up that ends up landing a 747 at a large airport in the middle of a populous city. " How many people actually call up their friends and suggest heading down to the theater to catch a screening of this movie? I'd love to call all 4 people who have rented this movie since it came out and ask them if they miss their 3 dollars. Not that I watched it or anything, I just...read about it....shut up.  -alex

      I got my Stanford application in the mail a few days ago, so I guess the beginning of this whole insane process has arrived with it. The colleges I plan on applying to as of now:  University of Arizona University of Colorado Stanford University University of Michigan University of Maryland Arizona State University  Those are in no particular order, and the list is pretty much devoid of small schools simply because most smaller schools don't have Aerospace Engineering, which is what I plan on doing.  My birthday's coming up, if anyone was any great ideas what to ask for, let me know.  -alex

      I don't get why people think energy drinks are all cool now. They're not. You can say you need to stay awake for whatever reason, but a Coke will do fine for that. You can argue that it tastes good, but you know it doesn't. You can say you're tired, in that case you should probably sleep (Concept, anyone?). You can say Red Bull and alcohol go good together, but somehow mixing something that speeds up your heart rate with something that slows it down just doesn't sound like a great idea to me. The Red Bull ads annoy me. The dumb little Red Bull car annoys me. Even the stupid little Red Bull half-can annoys me. But what gets me more than anything is the people who think drinking an energy drink makes them look cool or hip. Go home people.     -alex

      Is it smarter to answer questions or to ask them?  When you spend hours fishing, which animal really seems to be outsmarting the other, the fish or the human?  Doesn't it seem like you can have more fun in one good conversation than in all the parties you go to combined?  If a large portion of inventions just end up causing more problems than they solve, shouldn't we just cut our losses and stop inventing things?  Is it OK to be intolerant of intolerant people?  Which would you prefer, everyone liking you or everyone respecting you?  Aside from obvious scientific changes, how would the world be different if there was no night?  How do we know that that we don't have impaired vision and color blind people are seeing things how they really are?  Is life so complicated just because we make it that way?   -alex

      I don't know how often the average person dreams. I have like 1-2 dreams every 6 months that I actually remember, and they're never very fun. But every once in a while I have one of the good ones. The kind that has people you know and like, the kind with intelligible dialogue. Not one of the ridiculous ones where your flying or falling, but an actual legitimate situation. It's the kind that covers every little detail, so it plays almost like a little movie. It's the kind that just makes itself exactly what you want (Because honestly, why shouldn't it?). It's the kind that fills whatever void you have so well that, for a little while, you actually believe it to be real, just because deep down you want it to so bad. It's the kind that disappoints you so much when you realize that its perfect world won't be waiting outside your door that when you open your eyes, everything seems darker.  -alex

      Apparently now I'm in a band as a violinist, yet I don't play violin. I better get on that. I actually had a cool, productive day today that didn't result in me coming home and listening to depressing Dashboard songs all night, so thanks to all the people I hung out with today. I learned that if you put an egg in a microwave for a minute, take it out, and just hold it, eventually it will explode. This could make me rich if I play my cards right. Anyway I'm going up to Pinetop till Saturday morning.  Katie: dust off the bass, it's game time.  -alex

      It just doesn't click. I know this is a terribly cynical generalization, but it seems that the wrong thing to do is both easy and fun, while the right thing, though satisfying in the end, is dull and difficult. I'm hanging out with friends because I have nothing else to do. I don't want to get too specific, but I chose to throw back Dr. Pepper all night instead of alcohol, so while people have their drunken fun and others partake in the proverbial game of baseball, I have the pleasure of playing solitaire on someone else's kitchen table. By myself. For three hours. And now I decide to hijack this computer and blog. I don't really enjoy playing the martyr, but I simply don't understand why you always have to pay some price to do the right thing. It doesn't make sense. Now I know rationality is both severely overrated and painfully uncommon. And I know that a truly selfless person wouldn't go online and bitch about making some petty sacrifice, but I'm just tired of this basic situation manifesting itself night after night. Where's the real fun, where you don't have to be wasted? It seems to have been misplaced, and there doesn't seem to be very many people looking for it.   -alex

      What in the world makes AP tests so ridiculously expensive?  Are politicians really less honest than the average person, or are they just an accurate sampling of society in general?  Why do people pay $1.99 for gas, when, in clear view down the street, there's a gas station with gas for $1.89?  Do you think someday the whole political correctness thing will get so out of hand that people will complain that in a deck of playing cards, all the face cards are white people?  Why do cops tailgate you? Are they just taunting you like "haha, yea, just go ahead and break 45, sucker"?  Isn't there kind of a small ethical dilemma when someone gives you a burned copy of a CD they payed for?  Are you annoyed by all my quasi-rhetorical questions?  Who else is disappointed that all the really cool things have already been invented? (sticky notes, pizza bagels, etc.)  If people were never introduced to the concept of violence, would they discover in themselves on their own?   -alex

      So it's around my favorite time of year: school shopping time. (Insert ridiculously sarcastic tone) As most of you know, my clothing repertoire isn't anything all that impressive so I figured I'd extend my wardrobe from 3 shirts to maybe 5 or 6, and from 1 pair of shorts to 3 or 4. Shorts are simple and no problem to find. You'd think that shirts would be as easy, but alas, they are not. All I really want is a simple solid color T-shirt with whatever brand name or logo modestly placed on the front but down at the mall that does not seem to be an option. I could go with the typical Abercrombie/American Eagle horizontal striped polo and turn myself into Alex Uber-preppie. I could overpay for a T-shirt with some blatantly suggestive faux-advertisement on it, like "Alex's Hot Dog Stand: Open All Night". Always a classy choice. Another option is the T-shirt with some oversized retro advertisement on the back for some Surf Shop or (Insert brand here) Athletic Team. The shirts without such obnoxious fake advertisements usually come in the form of a shirt with a gigantic "OLD NAVY" or "ABERCROMBIE" plastered across the chest, visible to the naked eye from hundreds of yards away. As much as I'd love to pay 20 dollars to do the company's advertising for them, I'm going to have to pass. I don't want a shirt with 3 panels of some stick figure cartoon, I don't want a shirt that misspells Hooked on Phonics, I don't want a shirt that has some "clever" one liner or pick up line on it, or one that attempts to make people think I'm a sociopath with voices in my head. Maybe I'll just have to stick with my A) Red, B) Blue, and C) Gray Aeropostale shirts for another year. I don't mind.  -alex

      The only problem I've run into with the blog so far is that I know, for the most part, who all reads it. Because I know this I tend to tailor the blog to these people, and instead of writing whatever is on my mind I have to avoid anything that may be awkward or offensive to these people. It's kind of a minor thing but, on some levels, it's defeating the basic purpose of the blog. If you have to ask yourself "Is he talking about me?", the answer is yes. This doesn't mean I'm going to stop or significantly change anything but it is simply a small source of frustration for me.  -alex

       Who Cares? Award : MTV. I don't care about Nick and Jessica's life, or what everyone's house looks like, or the Diary of so and so. "You think you know, but you have no idea, and you probably don't want to."   Most Played Show : The Ashlee Simpson Show. I don't even need to explain this one, you know it's true.   Late Night Award:  Conan O' Brien. How can you go wrong with a show that plays Walker, Texas Ranger clips as a comedy routine? Plus Leno and Letterman just aren't funny.   Worst Commercial:  YJ Stinger Energy Drink. Mmmmm, I really want to drink something that explodes with bees when I open it. Plus it's an energy drink.   You're Cool, But Not That Cool Award : People who watch The Daily Show. Granted Jon Stewart is hilarious and the show is great, but watching the show doesn't make you "unique" or "hip". It seems like a lot of people think they're "underground" because they like the show. News flash: everyone watches it, everyone likes it, you're not that cool.   Re-run the Re-runs Award:  Bravo. Bravo's lineup consists of three things: The West Wing reruns, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy reruns, and Celebrity Poker Showdown reruns. Even though I love the West Wing, I can only watch the same episode once or twice a day before I'm tired of it.  I'm going to add more as I go.  -alex
