      "Heracles journeyed to Lake Lerna in a speedy chariot, and with him he took his nephew and charioteer Iolaus, in search of the dreaded Hydra. When they finally reached the Hydras' hiding place, Heracles told Iolaus to stay with the horses while he drew the monster from its hole with flaming arrows. This brought out the hideous beast. Heracles courageously attacked the beast, flaying at each head with his sword, (in some versions a scythe) but he soon realized that as one head was severed another grew in its place. Heracles called for help from Iolaus, telling him to bring a flaming torch, and as Heracles cut off the heads one by one from the Hydra, Iolaus cauterized the open wounds with the torch preventing them from growing again. As Heracles fought the writhing monster he was almost stifled by its obnoxious breath, but eventually, with the help of Iolaus, Heracles removed all but one of the Hydras' heads. The one remaining could not be harmed by any weapon, so, picking up his hefty club Heracles crushed it with one mighty blow, he then tore off the head with his bare hands and quickly buried it deep in the ground, placing a huge boulder on the top. After he had killed the Hydra, Heracles dipped the tips of his arrows into the Hydras' blood, which was extremely poisonous, making them deadly."

      The Brazil that I knew Where I wandered with you Lives in my imagination.  Where the songs are passionate, And a smile has flash in it, And a kiss has art in it, For you put your heart in it, And so I dream of old Brazil  Where hearts were entertaining June, We stood beneath an amber moon And softly murmured "someday soon" We kissed and clung together, Then tomorrow was another day The morning found me miles away With still a million things to say  Now when twilight dims the sky above, Recalling thrills of our love, There's one thing I'm certain of; Return I will To old Brazil.

      "When Minamoto no Yorinobu, Governor of Kawachi and warrior, heard that someone in the East had a fine horse, he sent a message politely asking for it.  Unable to decline the request, the owner of the horse sent it to Kyoto.  On the way a horse thief saw it, desperately wanted it, and decided to steal it by any means.  So he followed it secretly.  But because the soldiers guarding it remained vigilant, the thief didn't have a chance to steal it before they all reached Kyoto.  Upon arriving in the Capital, the horse was first put in Yorinobu's stable.  In no time someone told Yorinobu's son, Yoriyoshi: "A fine horse has arrived at your father's place today from the East." When he heard this, Yoriyoshi thought: It's certain that an unworthy fellow will ask my father for the horse and get it sooner or later.  Before that happens I'll go see it, and if it's a really fine horse, I'll ask for it and get it.  So, even though it was pouring that day and it was already evening, Yoriyoshi, dying to see the horse, went to visit his father through the downpour.  "Well, why haven't you come to see me for such a long time?" the father said to his son.  Even while saying this, he guessed that his son had heard about the arrival of the horse and came with the thought of asking for it.  So, before Yoriyoshi opened his mouth, Yorinobu said, "I've heard that a horse has arrived from the East, but I haven't seen it yet.  The fellow who sent it to me says it's a fine horse.  It's too dark to see anything now.  If you look at it tomorrow morning and like it in any way, it's yours."  Told this before he made the request, Yoriyoshi was greatly pleased, "Well, then, sir" he said, "may I stay overnight, so that I may look at the horse in the morning?"  The two of them spent the evening gossiping.  When the night became late and the father retired to sleep in his bedroom, Yoriyoshi followed suit and lay in a room nearby to sleep.  Meanwhile, it continued to rain noisily.  Around midnight the thief stole in, mingling with the noise of the rain, led the horse out, and left.  Sometime later a cry went up from the direction of the stable : "A thief has taken the horse that arrived last night for the master!"  Yorinobu heard this, though faintly.  Without even asking the sleeping Yoriyoshi, "Did you hear that?" he tucked in the hem of his robe, as a lady would, as he rose to his feet.  He slung a quiver across his back and ran to the stable.  He led out a horse himself and put on it a cheap saddle which was on hand.  He then rode out, alone, toward Osaka Barrier to give chase.  As he did this, he thought, This thief must be a fellow from the East.  He saw it was a fine horse and followed it with the thought of stealing it, but he couldn't do it before reaching Kyoto.  Last night he came in by the noise of the rain and got away with it.  Yoriyoshi also had heard the cry.  He thought exactly as his father did, and didn't tell him, either.  He had gone to sleep in his clothes, so he simply got up, slung a quiver across his back, led out a horse from the stable, and rode out toward the Osaka Barrier to give chase, alone.  The father thought, My son is sure to come on this chase.  The son thought, My father is sure to be ahead of me, giving chase.  He galloped on.  By the time he passed the riverbed, the rain had stopped and the sky had cleared up.  He rode on even faster, until he came near the Osaka Barrier.  The thief, riding the horse he had stolen, thought he'd gotten away with it.  He slowed his hard gallop as he came to the Osaka Barrier and had his horse wade into the ample pool of water that had formed next to it.  When he heard that wading noise, Yorinobu, as if he had planned it with his son beforehand, and even though it was still dark and he didn't even know his son was there, cried out, "Shoot, he's there!"  He had hardly finished saying this when he heard the sound of a flying arrow.  He sensed something was hit.  Then he heard the clanking of empty stirrups as the startled horse broke into a gallop without its rider.  Yorinobu said, "You've shot the thief down! Run ahead and get hold of the horse!" Then, without waiting, he turned back and headed home.  Yoriyoshi ran ahead of the horse and got hold of it.  By then some of Yorinobu's soldiers had caught up, and these met Yoriyoshi on his way back, a few at a time.  By the time he reached Kyoto there were twenty to thirty of them with him.  Yorinobu got back to his mansion and, without even thinking of saying this or that, walked to his bedroom and went back to sleep, Yoriyoshi, too, went back to sleep after putting the horse he had brought back in the care of the grooms.  The following morning, Yorinobu called out Yoriyoshi.  But instead of evincing any knowledge of his son's extraordinary exploits of shooting and bringing back the horse, he simply ordered that the horse be brought out.  When it was, Yoriyoshi looked at it and saw it was a fine horse indeed.  He simply said, "I accept your offer, sir" and took the horse.  The only thing is that, though it hadn't been promised the previous night, the horse came with a fine saddle.  Yoriyoshi decided it was an award for shooting the thief down."

      "In martial arts there are a variety of rhythms.  First, you must learn to attune yourself to your opponent, then learn to disconcert him.  To learn, in rhythms large and small, slow and fast, how to be aggressive, to pause, or to go against your opponent's rhythm is crucial in martial arts.  In a martial combat, you must learn the rhythm of each opponent; and, with a rhythm he can't imagine, you win by creating a sophisticated rhythm out of the rhythm of the Void."  ...  "Keep your mind broad and straight; do not stretch it taut; do not allow it to grow in the least lax; do not make it lean to one side but hold it at the center; keep it quietly fluid, doing your best to maintain it in a fluid state even while it  is  fluid.  When you are quiet, your mind shouldn't be quiet; when you're moving fast, your mind shouldn't at all be moving fast.  Your mind shouldn't follow your body, nor should your body follow your mind.  Your mind must be cautious while your body is not.  Your mind should lack nothing while having no excess.  Superficially you may have your mind appear weak, but you must keep it strong inwardly, lest people can tell what you really are."  ...  "As for the two manners of seeing things,  kan  (observing) and  ken  (seeing), the eye for  kan  is strong, the eye for  ken  weak; seeing distant things as if they are close at hand and seeing close things as if they are distant is special to the art of fighting.  Knowing your opponent's sword and yet not in the least seeing it is important in the art of fighting."  ...  By knowing "the path of the sword" well, you can freely wield the sword you always carry, even with two fingers.  If you try to wield it unnaturally fast, its path becomes blocked and you can't wield it.  You must wield it as naturally as you can."  ...  "When you and your enemy are about to strike each other, your body and your mind turn into a single striking movement and your hands strike out of the void naturally, swiftly, powerfully.  This is called "no-thought, no-feature," and is of crucial importance."  ...  "'The officer knows his soldier' means this:  When the matter finally comes to battle, you face it with firm conviction that as far as what you're going to do is concerned, you have constantly studied the art of fighting and have gained a perfect knowledge of it, so that your enemy is no more than your soldier whom you can dispose of as you like and move about as you wish."  ...  "Ordinarily, the vulgar view holds that the place where things are not understood is the void.  But that is not the true Void, for there everyone remains lost.  In the art of fighting, too, if a samurai who pursues his duties doesn't know what the  law  for him is, he hasn't attained the state of void.  Someone like that will continue to be distracted in various ways and may describe something irrelevant as void, which of course is not the true Void.  If he firmly masters swordsmanship while also training hard in other martial arts; if he is not at all in the dark about what he is expected to do as a samurai and practices it, undistracted, every day and every hour; and if he polishes the two mental components of  shin , "the mind," and  i , "the will," and hones the two eyes of  kan , "observing," and  ken , "seeing," thereby reaching the place where nothing is clouded, distracting clouds having all cleared up, then the samurai will know what the true Void is."

       Bruce:  The details are cloudly. Luckily in my haze I took notes. The events I can speak of only now, but I can taste it like it was yesterday. The reason I survived? Perhaps to tell the tale...    The Hangover    Day One:   At 4:00 p.m. I wake up. By 9:00 p.m. I can make out shapes. I swear on the bible, although I don't actually own a bible, never again.   Day Two:   I am suprised to find a man asleep on my couch. He tells me he shares the same hangover and that he works with me. He teaches me this game called "Screaming Numbers," and we play until the neighbors complain.   Day Three:   Yay! I can move my head! I can move my head!   Day Four:   I take a short walk. I go to my answering machine. I check it. Good news. Only one person called. Bad news. It's my girlfriend and she called 17 times, referring to herself oddly as my "ex-girlfriend."   Day Five:   Finding a reflective surface, I am happy to note that my teeth have not been, in fact, removed with a hunting knife. I play a game of screaming numbers to celebrate. 11! 32! 9!   Day Six:   An angel appears. He brings me a pizza. He wants only paper for it. How beautiful his eyelashes are. Looking at the pizza I note I am now color blind. I fall asleep thinking of all of the old black and white films I have enjoyed--and will watch again.   Day Seven:   Hey, something smells!   Day Eight:   Today I suspect I am not hung over at all, but, in fact, an old man. An old man and I have been trapped in a hammock, spun around, and left to die. Left to die by people I do not remember and can't hate them by name.   Day Nine:   Further exploration of my answering machine reveals (although I have no recollection of this) I went into work. I went into work just long enough to play a game of screaming numbers and picked up what turned out to be my last check.   Day Ten:   Call a press conference. Only Steve Anthony of City TV arrives. I decide not to let him in.   Day Eleven:   I go to my ex-girlfriend's house and propose marriage. She does not accept. Neither does the man she refers to as "the new guy." After three hours she vows to take me back if I vow to stop drinking. Have small drink to celebrate. Snowflake becomes blizzard.   Day Twelve:   See day one.

      "About Kage no Gundan for a bit. There's like multiple sequel shows. You know, Kage no Gundan 1, 2, 3, 4. Every time they did a new series it was always a different Hattori Hanzo. It was set a little further in history. Hattori Hanzo number three, Hattori Hanzo number four. It just kept on going down. So now Sonny Chiba is playing Hattori Hanzo one hundred and still continuing that character.   Now the thing about this is that, the audience doesn't need to know any of this. I'm very much a believer that if you're creating your own universe and your own mythology, you can have no question unanswered. But here's the thing: I don't have to answer the questions to you the audience. You just need to know I know the answer.   I can tell you the whole story of how Hattori Hanzo ended up in Okinawa and why he didn't make a sword for 30 years, and who the bald guy is. I can tell you that. I don't have to tell you this during the watching of the movie, but you need to know how large this world is."

      "It might rashly be concluded from the preceding analysis that Homer's Odysseus was a man distracted by psychological conflicts and distressed by social tensions.  The general impression derived from the Homeric poems suggests nothing of the kind.  The inner and outer tensions are skilfully implied, but the total portrait is that of a man well integrated both in his own temperament and with his environment.  As Athene emphasized, he was essentially "self-possessed," fully able to control conflicting passions and motives.  His psychological tensions never reach a breaking point.  They serve rather to give him his dynamic force.  As a result his purposefulness is like an arrow shot from a well-strung bow, and his energy has the tirelessness of coiled springs.  Resilience, elasticity, concentration, these are the qualities that maintain his temperamental balance.  In contrast the Ajax-like hero was superficially firm and strong.  His code of conduct and his heroic pride encased his heart like archaic armor.  Once this psychological carapace was pierced by some violent shock the inner parts were as soft as any crustacean's.  Odysseus' strength and self-possession did not depend on any outer armor.  He could be as firm and enduring in the role of a beggar or in the cave of a Cyclops as in full battle-dress at Troy.  This was the quality that the Cynic and Stoic philosophers were most to admire later.  Such was his inner harmony and strength.  His conduct in matters of major importance shows a similar purposeful integrity.  He had a remarkable power of taking the long view, of seeing actions in their widest context, of disciplining himself to the main purpose in hand.  Thus while other heroes at Troy are squabbling like children over questions of honor and precedence, Odysseus presses on steadily towards victory.  And why?  Not, Homer implies, for the sake of triumph and plunder, but in order to return to his beloved Ithaca as soon as possible.  Here Odysseus' efforts for the Greek cause are integrated with his fundamental love of home;   pro bono publico  is ultimately  pro domo sua .  Similarly his loyalty to the Companions during the fabulous voyages, and his patience with their infuriating alternations of rashness and timidity, were part of the same enlightened egotism:  he needed a crew to sail his ship home.  His love for Penelope, too, was, as has been suggested already, not based entirely on  eros  or  agape , but also contained that  philia , that attachment to one's normal and natural social environment which underlies so much of Greek happiness.  And his piety is the piety of one who wishes to keep on good terms with the gods.  Such mixed motives may seem impure or ignoble to those who take their ideals from self-sacrificing patriotism, or from self-effacing saintliness, or from self-forgetting romanticism.  But these are post-Homeric concepts.  Within the context of the Heroic Age and perhaps of the Homeric Age, too, this identification of one's own best interests with the general welfare of one's kith, kin, and comrades, with one's  philoi  in fact, was a saving grace for both the individual and society.  All the Homeric heroes are egotists;  but Odysseus' egotism has sent its roots out more widely into his personal environment than that of Agamemnon, Achilles, or Ajax."

       prudence, discretion, foresight, forethought, circumspection  These nouns refer to the exercise of good judgment, common sense, and even caution, especially in the conduct of practical matters. Prudence is the most comprehensive: "She had been forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older" (Jane Austen). Discretion suggests wise self-restraint, as in resisting a rash impulse: "The better part of valor is discretion" (Shakespeare). Foresight implies the ability to foresee and make provision for what may happen: She had the foresight to make backups of her computer files. Forethought suggests advance consideration of future eventualities: The empty refrigerator indicated a lack of forethought. Circumspection implies discretion, as out of concern for moral or social repercussions: "The necessity of the times, more than ever, calls for our utmost circumspection" (Samuel Adams).

       Aaron Beck's Cognitive Therapy  Beck developed his approach independently from Ellis, but there are numerous similarities in their approaches. Both were originally trained in the psychoanalytic tradition and moved to more cognitively focused approaches. Both try to help clients learn to notice (pay attention to) the occurrence of maladaptive cognitions, recognize their disruptive and destructive impact, and replace them with more realistic and adaptive thought pattterns. Both are programmatic, problem-oriented, and directive. Both give clients "homework" assignments as part of the treatment.    Beck's List of Common Maladaptive Cognitions  Unlike Ellis, Beck does not view these beliefs as necessarily irrational, but rather too absolute, too broad, too extreme, or too arbitrary.   ARBITRARY INFERENCE. This is drawing a conclusion without evidence or in the presence of contradictory evidence, like believing you were laid off due to incompetence when the company is going out of business.   OVERGENERALIZATION. (Same as Ellis.) Drawing a broad general conclusion from a single narrow specific incident.   SELECTIVE ABSTRACTION. Focusing on a detail while ignoring the context--like feeling rejected because a friend who was busy didn't stop to talk, or thinking that the only things that matter are failures, which are the main measure of yourself.   PERSONALIZATION. Mistakenly viewing yourself as the source of some event that had another cause.   POLARIZED (DUALISTIC, DICHOTOMOUS) THINKING. Thinking in extreme either-or fashion.  Dualistic thinking, which we'll meet again later in this chapter, includes either-or mental habits like interpreting a mild rebuff as total rejection  MAGNIFICATION AND MINIMIZATION. Viewing that something is far more or less important than it really is.   Jumping to conclusions without evidence to back them up includes several more specific habits of thought. Among these are errors of omission, like emphasizing a detail while ignoring its larger context, and personalizing—incorrectly referring an outside event to oneself: "She's terribly angry—it must be something I did."   The Intervention Process  Beck's approach useds both cognitive restructuring and overt behavioral interventions. His test of whether a cognition is accurate does not rely on rationality so much as on testing it against empirical evidence. He casts himself as a co-investigator seeking to empirically test his client's beliefs. His style is collaborative rather than confrontational. He gives his clients homework "experiments" that involves actually finding out whether what they imagine is true or not. For instance, a woman believed that one of her coworkers disliked her because he seldom spoke to her. The therapist suggested that she view this idea as a hypothesis and check it out by observing how often he interacted with other women in the office. She was surprised to find that he seldom spoke to any of the women, and finally let go of her mistaken idea.   Therapy includes helping clients ferret out "automatic thinking." First he has to become aware of what he is thinking. Second, he needs to recognize what thoughts are awry. Then he has to substitute accurate for inaccurate judgments. Finally he needs feedback to inform him whether his changes are correct. The technique includes a problem orientation, and provides a therapeutic rationale and a clear programmatic direction.

      From being mainly a tactical Chess player, [Steinitz] changed to become the first strategic player in chess history.  His new idea was that victory can not be obtained just by the will of power, creating attacks when there are no justified reasons to do so. Instead, attack is the logical consequence of the accumulation of small advantages obtained in the previous moves. These advantages included better development, more space, better pawn structure, pair of bishops, etc.      Steinitz was the first to understand that Chess has important constraints to creativity. It has a rigid internal logic, and only by understanding this logic is it possible to win a game against strong players.  He demonstrated the importance of these points of view both in his substantial writings and in his games. Steinitz's development marks the starting point of chess systematics. Before Steinitz, Chess theory was at most a collection of tricks, especially tactical opening variations.     With Wilhelm Steinitz and his followers, the theory underlying not only opening, but also middlegame and endgame and, most importantly, the logical connection between the different parts of the game, began to be understood. Although Steinitz theories have been demonstrated to be only guidelines, not to be followed with closed eyes, the rules that he developed are still the backbone of modern Chess strategy.

       Logos  was equally important.   Logos  was the rational, pragmatic, and scientific thought that enabled men and women to function well in the world.  We may have lost the sense of  mythos  in the West today, but we are very familiar with  logos , which is the basis of our society.  Unlike myth,  logos  must related exactly to facts and correspond to external realities if it is to be effective.  It must work efficiently in the mundane world.  We use this logical, discursive reasoning when we have to make things happen, get something done, or persuade other people to adopt a particular course of action.   Logos  is practical.  Unlike myth, which looks back to the beginnings and to the foundations,  logos  forges ahead and tries to find something new: to elaborate on old insights, achieve a greater control over our environment, discover something fresh, and invent something novel.

      We tend to assume that the people of the past were (more or less) like us, but in fact their spiritual lives were rather different.  In particular, they evolved two ways of thinking, speaking, and acquiring knowledge, which scholars have called  mythos  and  logos .  Both were essential; they were regarded as complementary ways of arriving at truth, and each had its special area of competence.  Myth was regarded as primary; it was concerned with what was thought to be timeless and constant in our existence.  Myth looked back to the origins of life, to the foundations of culture, and to the deepest levels of the human mind.  Myth was not concerned with practical matters, but with meaning.  Unless we find some significance in our lives, we mortal men and women fall very easily into despair.  The  mythos  of a society provided people with a context that made sense of their day-to-day lives; it directed their attention to the eternal and the universal.  It was also rooted in what we would call the unconscious mind.  The various mythological stories, which were not intended to be taken literally, were an ancient form of psychology.  When people told stories about heroes who descended into the underworld, struggled through labyrinths, or fought with monsters, they were bringing to light the obscure regions of the subconscious realm, which is not accessible to purely rational investigation, but which has a profound effect upon our experience and behaviour.

      Odysseus of the Iliad foreshadows Odysseus of the Odyssey not only in his epithets (resourceful, long-suffering, etc.) but in his whole character.  I do not know whether this means that the same man composed both Iliad and Odyssey; but it does mean that the author of the Odyssey thoroughly understood the Odysseus of the Iliad.  We can, I think, argue from one work to the other.   Odysseus is crafty, resourceful, daring, and merciless.  These characteristics have usually been taken as essentials of his personality, from which stem the stop-at-nothing politician of Sophocles, or Dante's treacherous captain ( Inferno , Canto 26).  But guile and unscrupulousness are only secondary characteristics of the Homeric Odysseus.   Essentially, he can be described by the Greek word  sophron  (though the word is not Homeric).  This is untranslatable.  It means, not necessarily that you have superior brains, but that you make maximum use of whatever brains you have got.  Odysseus is the antithesis of Achilleus.  Achilleus has a fine intelligence, but passion clouds it; Odysseus has strong passions, but his intelligence keeps them under control.  Achilleus, Hektor, and Agamemnon, magnificent as they are, are flawed with uncertainty and can act on confused motives; Odysseus never.  So those three are tragic heroes, but Odysseus, less magnificent but a complete man, is the hero of his own romantic comedy, the  Return of Odysseus , or  Odyssey .   A single purpose guides Odysseus in the Iliad.  The expedition against Troy must succeed.  Whether this motive grows out of personal affection for Agamemnon is not clear.  But this is the end toward which the demoralized army must be rallied, Thersites chastised, Achilleus propitiated, Agamemnon braced.  A single purpose guides Odysseus through the Odyssey as well.  He must get home and put his house and kingdom in order.  To do this, he must drive his men and himself, outwit and outlast trial by danger and trial by pleasure, leave the blandishing goddesses, fight down his joy at seeing home and wife for fear joy might give him away prematurely, fight down, for the same reason, rage at seeing the disorder in his household.   A man who could win through all this is a man supremely adequate, in mind and body; therefore, by corollary, resourceful, much enduring. Odysseus can be most eloquent, but he wastes no eloquence on Thersites--who has an unanswerable argument--but beats him up and makes him cry, which is far more effective.  He can build a raft and sail it, or build a bed, or plough a field.  He has no recklessness, but does have stark courage when that is needed; the Odysseus who makes the plans for others to fight by is post-Homeric.  Always equal to the occasion, he startles the Trojans who think he looks like a fool and can be no orator, as he startles the suitors who take him for a broken-down tramp.  Not the noblest or stateliest of Homer's heroes, he is the one who survives.

      O! Exhausted that female has me. Not so young now. Will she come here tomorrow? Wait for her somewhere for ever. Must come back. Murderers do. Will I?  Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot. Write a message for her. Might remain. What?   I.   Some flatfoot tramp on it in the morning. Useless. Washed away. Tide comes here a pool near her foot. Bend, see my face there, dark mirror, breathe on it, stirs. All these rocks with lines and scars and letters. O, those transparent! Besides they don't know. What is the meaning of that other world. I called you naughty boy because I do not like.   AM. A.   No room. Let it go.  Mr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot. Hopeless thing sand. Nothing grows in it. All fades.

      As he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face upwards on the ground. His great neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon him. Presently he turned sick, and threw up both wine and the gobbets of human flesh on which he had been gorging, for he was very drunk.   Then I thrust the beam of wood far into the embers to heat it, and encouraged my men lest any of them should turn faint-hearted. When the wood, green though it was, was about to blaze, I drew it out of the fire glowing with heat, and my men gathered round me, for heaven had filled their hearts with courage.   We drove the sharp end of the beam into the monster's eye, and bearing upon it with all my weight I kept turning it round and round as though I were boring a hole in a ship's plank with an auger, which two men with a wheel and strap can keep on turning as long as they choose. Even thus did we bore the red hot beam into his eye, till the boiling blood bubbled all over it as we worked it round and round, so that the steam from the burning eyeball scalded his eyelids and eyebrows, and the roots of the eye sputtered in the fire. As a blacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet into cold water to temper it- for it is this that gives strength to the iron- and it makes a great hiss as he does so, even thus did the Cyclops' eye hiss round the beam of olive wood,   And his hideous yells made the cave ring again.

      The knight is not a long-range piece like the bishop, rook, or queen.  It has to be relatively close to the action in order to have any effect.  Furthermore, it takes a knight a lot longer to get somewhere than it takes a bishop, rook, or queen.  These are the disadvantages of the knight compared to the other pieces.  But the knight also has one big advantage; it can hop over other pieces.  Once you get the knight close to the action, it doesn't matter whether the squares next to it are occupied or not, it still has the same power.  What can we conclude from these observations?  The knight wants to find a strong square somewhere in the middle of the board or close to some weak spot in the opponent's position, and then the knight wants to sit there.  The knight doesn't care about getting a "clear view" of anything, since it always has the same view no matter what.  But the knight also doesn't want to have to move around too much, because it is so much slower than the other pieces.

      I'm in the process of gutting this weblog.  I figure this blog will be something of an online scrapbook--random stuff I'm compelled to copy down for whatever reason.  All the personal whiney stuff will be moving to an anonymous location where I don't feel self-conscious.  Witty and informative observations will be delivered to my friends in a more direct fashion.  I am currently learning how to be witty and informative.  Oh, and I've changed the title back to ye olde 'note to self' because that one was always my favorite.  I find it really speaks towards the essence of me rocking.
