      Ya know, its weird to think that someone way out there somewhere in this huge vast world, actually cares about you or me.... its odd to think that someone is thinkin about u all the time. I always wonder what kind of an impact i've made on the world. Just cuz I'd like to think that someone would say to someone else someday, yeah i remember that girl! She helped me out of a real difficult situation when i thought nothing would pull me through. Wouldn't that be cool? In all reality, it seems that if ya change someones life, maybe just even one person.... you could change the history of the world. Take for example... um.... Hitler.. now there's a good example. What if maybe one person helped him out in art so that he'd become better at it for school or for a further carrier... he might have been one of those really nice famous artists that we other artists have to study and learn about in the books and go, oh that's a nice picture!  Another thing i've been thinkin bout recently, i've always wondered what it is that makes people so self concious about what others think about them. What's wrong with sayin screw the world, i wanna do this my way?!? We'd have lots more interestin things goin on if ya ask me. Not that the world isn't already interestin enuf but just sayin ya know. And if ya think about it some more, if we're always changin to please what other people think about us, then maybe our own actual personality gets lost in all of the changing to fit the crowd.... and we lose our actual own personality. Then ya gotta wonder if who ya are is actually you..... odd isn't it?   Anyway, i was just thinkin bout these things cuz i was sittin here bored cuz it seemed no one online&nbsp;really wanted to talk, and i started thinkin if&nbsp;i was doin somethin wrong to irritate em or somethin and i started thinkin if i needed to change my conversations and such to make people feel more at ease talkin with me... i mean i might be too intimidating or too cheery, or too immature, or too somethin ya know? ...... i hate thinkin. It makes me wonder about odd things that probably are irrelevent to what's actually happenin. More or less i should probably spend less time on the computer. Otherwise i might become addicted to talkin to people and thus become dependent on someone talkin to me ya know? Ok i'm done sharing for tonight. Maybe i'll talk somemore tomorrow or somethin. Catchya'll later! :D  Kate

      Woooaaahh! this is cool! Sorry if some of my letter things aren't professional, but this is my first time usin this! ..... so is this some type of stress relieving thing or like a diary? You know what's gonna be cool about this? This is kinda like a diary thing that that one lady uses in the tv series Sex In The City! How cool!  WELL, its like 5 in the mornin and heaven knows why i'm up at this time, probably cuz am not used to all the time change. GUESS WHAT!!! I just got back from England! Very cool place everyone just in case ya'll were wonderin! The people are FAB! And they have tea like 24/7 lol! just kiddin just kiddin. But am so proud of myself, i now know how to make a proper english tea!  &nbsp; Ok well anyway, i suppose i best say a lil about me so u know what my other letters will be like (sorry if this ones so boring, but it always is on an introduction innit?) weeeeellllllll.......... in general, am a really easy outgoing person. I don't have a split personality really. What ya see is what ya get i suppose! But that's just cuz i'm too lazy to develope a mean half lol! Anyone can tell ya that i love being around people and chillin with them! Am a really great listener so ya know, if any of ya need to talk am here for ya........ i may not have the best answers to your problems but hey everyone needs&nbsp;a shoulder to cry on yeah? ;) Don't worry bout catchin me at a bad time, am always in a good mood. Depends how much coffee i drink lol :D the more espresso shots, the happier i am! Ok anway, i hate it when people blab on too much about themselves so i'll leave it at that for now.  &nbsp; Adios! :D

      AAHHHHH!!!!!!! I hate guys! How can they be so insanely sweet and great one moment and then turn into a girls living hell???? i hate they way they make me feel. I mean, the moment i feel like i get really close to a guy, then it all seems to go to crap! what the heck??? You know what? that does it. I'm never going to let myself get close to a guy. What's the friggin point? The minute you start to want to share urself with them its like they switch on the reverse mode and back up to stage one and you start to feel like you've never known them. Or even worse, when ya start to feel like your pushin ur dream guy away. It's so stupid. You know i sit here after talkin to one, and its like.......... ah gosh i don't even wanna get into it its so stupid. Guys out there readin this, i swear its nothing against you, i'm just having a mad moment where i hate all men atm. But i'm sure there are some of you out there that are just lovely. I mean for gosh sakes, the guy makes me cry, why the heck do i like him??? i feel like slapping myself for being so stupid into thinking that i had any chance. ARGH for freak sake! I HATE HIM! Get real girl! He'll never like you and that's the end of that! .......... (sigh) ok i feel a bit better now.... i suppose the 2 hour sob helped as well. Ok i don't hate him he just....... frusterates me right now. I don't like him... i don't. It was just a phase and now i'm done with it. Yep. Ok i'm cool. Wow that was theraputic.
