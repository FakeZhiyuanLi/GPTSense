      Long time no post huh? Not having good internet access really does suck, But at least i have something.   Anyway, you're not here to listen to me complain about the internet, u wanna know whats going on in my life a.k.a. the Jamie show! (this episoded featuring a guest appearance by James)  So, yesterday. I was at work for most of the day doing crappy jobs for a pissed off boss. so you can see why i jumped at the chance to "go drinkin'" and it lived up to all my expectations!  We started the night in chelmer village, trying to get everyone to get off their asses in asda car park and go get some drink. After about 15 mins of everyone saying lets go, we went. The non-drunken walk into town was ok, but as always it took 4 years (y'know, give or take) but we passed the time by commenting on how every other sentance sarah says is a dumb blonde comment. (even though she has dark hair) Once we got into town, we decided to hit the co-op in molsham street, to try and get served. This was the plan -  Me and Mike Bignall would go in, pickup what we want and if they asked for I.D. i would say "i didnt think i'd need it" and mike would produce his fake ID.  yeah, it didnt work! they didnt accept that form of ID. so we went to molsham wines who, as paul so adeptly put it "would serve a 7 year old if he had the money" we got a crate of bud and some poffy drinks for the girls. The next destination on our bowl-fest was 24 hour tescos. We went in for more beerand i decided that it would look better if i payed for it on my own, so mike headed off into the freezer section and i went to what i thought was a nice young person on the tills. turns out she was nearly 40 and looked very good for her age! she asked me for ID and when i didnt have any she called her manager over who said "nah he looks like one or my mates, i'd say about 19" That made me smile! and naturally i milked it for all i could, saying that people always say how young i look for my age and such!  Anyways, after that we just went drinking in a field (john shennons or something) and not alot happened. Just some good old bonding and much photo taking. check out www.p00p.co.uk and this one http://www.p00p.co.uk/gallery.php?d=2004/06-June/26/&v=Bum-Boys.JPG  Good times!!  We ended the night with everyone going for cheesy chips. By the time we reached the army and navy, it was just me and joe.... so we went for more beer! all we could get was mankey stella though, so i didnt drink many, only about 4 or 5. We ate our chips on this boat, i think its the muddy waters, at like half 1 in the morning! it was great! The best bit being when the chef walked in on us (we just got on and drank and ate not their food) and just said   "........ i'll leave you to it then" and we were left there untill they closed!  The walk home took approximatly 4 seconds, and me and joe stopped on the roundabout and in a playpark (the playpark was great, spinning everywhere!)before stumbling in at half 2 in the morning. joe crashed on my couch, and i came down and woke him up real early, as is the custom after i drink!! I think thats all i want to put in here, check joes blog for details that i missed!  today was not great... i spent alot of it asleep and as a result, i will not sleep tonight!!!!  -(long post huh?)-  see ya next time, same veg time, same veg channel  Keep it safe,  Veg  P.S. Those of u who know about my uhh... problem i have, should know that i think ive made some good progress. its getting clearer what i should do.

      I seriously think i must have done something to someone or something, because some greater force has decided to smite me! I dont remember all of the things that happened, but i had a pizza from town, and it made me ill. ITS BREAD, CHEESE AMND TOMATOS. Wtf in that could have made me ill?! Then there was the stack.... this stack is so legendary! Im on my way home, skating past the river (bet u think u know what happens :D) when i suddenly stopped. There was no stone, i checked. The wheels are fine, i just stopped! Divine intervention? who knows. All i know is that i now have a red patch on my knee and my holey (...^_^) jeans now have an extra hole in them and probably wont be worn again. Ugh  Old news - Camping. Im sure that you have either read an account from sarah or Joe's blogs, and it seems like a waste of my energy to type it all again. so i wont! And im not gona rub it in peoples faces that we DIDNT  get hurt/lost/arrested. Im glad they cared about us enough to warn us. ta guys, but have a lil faith in us! :D  what else?.....   Today, Fathers day! I bought my dad a golf ball monogrammer! it puts his initial on it (or random/ rude phrases!!!!) and its re-useable! i had much to drink, and as a result am entirely not tired. If i had credit i would be texting all you guys so bad!!!  i cant think of anything else, but seeing as i havent got any gossip, i think that im gona post the first ever   !-!Dave watch!-! Little Dave is this bird that follows me around. I think im gona post when and where i saw him if i have no gossip! Little dave was up in tile kiln this morning, and then spent the evening at my grandparents, eating the bread i threw for him. !-!/Dave watch!-!  .... ok that sucked a little bit...  lets hope i find some gossip huh?  Random thought 1 - i like that new britney spears song.... s'calming Random thought 2 - I just farted.  ah well, untill next time kiddos! Keep it safe Naked-Veg :D

      Nothing muchn to blog about today, its been pretty dull. I had the first two lessons only, giving me four hours of being a bum in the common room (actually, i only had 1 1/2 lessons, the second one was called off halfway due to rain) Anyways, it seems pauls had enough of my "flirting" with the other girls, mainly Kelly and Sarah and to a certain extent, Rach. What can i say Paul? Except that ive become everything i ever hated back at www.twinking.crimsonblog.com (see one of the old posts) and i have to say, I enjoy it! You may look dumb and such, but hey, who doesnt like abit of attention every now and then (especially from the opposite sex?!)  With that out of the way, there aint much to say really. 'cept that were still on for camping, even with the others trying to scare us into not going, and i think i have found the perfect place! its secluded, trees all around, and away from roads. i think its private property but it dosent look like many people have been there.....  ever...... I shall name these new fields "The Veggie fields"  Oh, and TKMaxx still made me work with my buggered arm, but its getting better! Ta for all the sympathy (even though it was my fault!)  uhh,.... i'll update some other time (prehaps from my nan's on sunday) about the Veggie fields trip.  Keep it safe Veg  -_-Gossip-_- aparantly everyones saying Joe's got a drinking problem... i say drink up dude, its my round! Enjoy it while u can!!   -_-/Gossip-_-

      Wow.... I havent done this for like only 2 days.... and i have so much to say!!!  Ok, first things first. MY ARM IS KILLING ME! I dont mean it has a knife and a short temper,  mean that I fell of my skateboard VERY painfully and now my arm wont move up or down. Now normally a stack on a skateboard wouldnt stop me for very long, but this one was special! We thought it would be fun to set the halfpipe on fire and try to skate it like that. Turns out metal dosen't catch alight very well, even with lighter fluid on the coping. so we gave up.  UNfortunutly, lighter fluid is EXTREMELY slippery and i stacked it so bad onto my arm its not even funny.and now it has swollen to twice the size.  bleh!!  Aside from that, things are peachy keen! England just won 3-0 against switzerland. Man, that was a good match! so good that it put me to sleep. after we scored the first goal, i nodded off...... to wake up and think we had won 2-0. i only saw rooney's lucky goal through a replay. Ah well, good on the team.  In other news, Sarah and Joe went to the zoo today, despite all warnings from local doctors. They were told prior to departing for colchester that animalitus was in the air that day, and it seems that they both caught it. They were seen leaving the animal sanctuary (sp?) looking more animal than man (or sarah). Joe had seemed to catch the Zebra version of the deadly virus, whilst Sarah walked out with the face of a lion. I'm sure i speak for everyone when i say "that'll learn ya, ya bastards"  Its also official, me and Paul have given up Chemistry for good. Holy crap it feels good, seeing the others go in while we just sit it out, doing the "were not going to chemisty but you are" dance. Its hard to explain the dance, but basically we are skanking, while swearing at the others! Its a classic.  Lastly, last night was fun. After fooking up my arm i walked home, to be met by paul. We then went knocking for everyone who's fun in CV. Martin came out, so did sam (albeit very briefly), ben g was at the gym(pronounced gyme)and Rach was at a play. everyone was boring and doing nothing so me and paul sat in Asda just talking about stuff. But the conversation always turned to girls... I cant say what was said, i'd have 2 kill you.... metaphorically of course...  ~~~Gossip!~~~ When i was walking home at 11pm ish, Rach was on her way to Larry boys! :@O and she was late to school the next morning....~~~/Gossip~~~  i think thats it, its certainly long enough... keep it safe Veg   .......Ive just been told that they do not have animalitus... it was facepaints...i apologise for any concern caused. :D

      I had really forgotten how much i love the 6th form! Its just the best place in the world for me right now. Even with people throwing my hat into the sink, getting it soaked. I still love that small building! I had a few more lessons this time thabn yesterday, and it really hit me. This is back at school time, i might actually have 2 try this year... anyways, back to th more interesting stuff. It looks like we ARE going camping on the weekend, seeing as me and joe went into town to get supplies. Which ment that we were going in for the disposable BBQ's and firelighters. We also bought lighter fluid, matches and i bought a lighter (which is cool, and im playing with it now! :D) Lol me and Joe are in charge of the fire making (and puting out eventually) and its gonna be too fun!!!! we ended the night with a small drinking session at mine. sitting in the garde, reminising about good times had, when i havent even known Joe for a year yet... s'weird, feels like ive known him all my life.  Anyways, aside from nostalgia, ive had a weird thing happen. Emma has started speaking to me again, who knows what this means but i dunno. Could be goood but in my experience, talking to exe's only leads to awkward conversations and arguments. I dont need her anymore. Ive moved on. and aparantly so has she, im not sure if she was trying to make me jelous, but she was going on about how she dot drunk and laid every night on holiday.   I just turned it around an implied that she was some sort of slag....   aint i a stinker?  lol thats enough for now. see ya kext time keep it safe Veg

      OK, OK i know this is hardly the least imaginative thing ever, but i thought beccas blog looked much better than my old one... and i like complaining! Anyways, its monday today.... which ment back so school to start the A2 already. I was dreading the lessons, but i was secretly really REALLY happy sitting in the common room at lunch. Its times like that today that remind me just why im scraping through and staying there. I love that room.And the people in it! (no im not drunk.... i just have a lot of fun there)  Anyways, the title of this blog is referring to what happened at work a few hours ago. I got in and they told me that over £270 was missing from my till on saturday. and all i could think was "Holy crap... they think ive stolen from them." They say that then dont think it was my fault, that it could be a computing error or something. but damn, how else could it have not worked?  blerg,.....  Anyways, it looks like were going camping on saturday night, in honour of Sarah Marlows birthday. It should be a great laugh, but im worried about Joe and Becca. Things aint right, and theyre saying theyre "on a break" which can never be a good thing.... hopefully they will have made it up by saturday.  Anyways, i think thats enough for now.... watch this space.  Keep it safe,  Veg  **thinks** i need something to go at the ends here.... anyone got any suggestions? **/thinking**
