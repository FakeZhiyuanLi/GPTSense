      Good Morning to everyone who is reading this! i have just woke up and came down stairs and it is exactly seven am, and the date is the 18th august2004! i'm very exited because today i am going to cyprus, or at least today i wil start going to cyprus... tonight, me my mam, dad and my brother will leave the house and head to newcastle airport, we will get there at about 09:30. we must then wait for a long (and boring) time untill 11:30 for us to board the plane (but everbody knows that you never take off at scedualed times).  The flight will take about 4 hours, then we must wait to collect our bags and luggage before we head out of the airport were we get our passports checked!!  After all that we need to wait for a coach to take us to our apartment (this will take about an hour).  so we will arive at the hotel apartment at about 7:00, and we will start our day without any sleep. it is exactly 7:00 here, i'm going to be awake for about 38 hours with no sleep at all......... Could you cope with that? email me at  urlLink sk8rboiNat@hotmail.com , i will read all emails in a week, unless you send them before 10:00, 18th.. i will not be able to update my blog, because as i have found out, my computer will not fit in my backpack!!

       i own a website that is found at  urlLink www.scoolboi.tk , i was going to keep it anonymous, but since so many people no that i own it, i will quit the anonymous stuff, but i will keep the website up and running, because i have a dream, to own websites that make people happy, that have a lot of popularity. That will make me feel very happy, and i will devote my life to it, though i feer that my life will disapear in front of my computer, i feel that i'm living virtually and not practally, so i will limit my time on the internet, and enjoy the long life ahead of me, as i am only 12 years of age but i feel so old on this computer...........................
