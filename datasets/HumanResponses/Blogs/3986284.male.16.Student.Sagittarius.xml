       Ok, I know I said I was going to update this yesterday to Jojo but I forgot, sorry. But yeah, yesterday was fun, me and the joo went to Wet n Wild. It was great, the highlight of it was that we came out of the dragon's den backwards and flipped over. But there was a lot of other good things, like eye candy. You know I thought about talking to some of them, but I didn't b/c of a thought in the back of my head about the woman who "loves" me, Laura. But anyway, there was also free food and everytime i got a soda i couldn't finish it but oh well. Yeah I got sunburned on my shoulders, a lil on my arms, and my feet. Lol, last night I put baby oil on them, i looked sexi. I'm gona blog about what happened to day later, b/c hopefully I can talk to Jojo before then. byeeeeee

       So hey ya'll and yes I said "ya'll". Anyway, yeah my shirt is messed up. I am missing a button. I'm gonna tell you all right now, if it wasn't for Matt being blood, he would be laying in a puddle of it. I'm serious, I hate him as a person. I could of killed him many times today, but I just couldn't do it b/c he is blood. Lol, motherfucker got pissed off at me b/c of the car and tore my shirt then threw a can of soda at me. That's nothing though, I hate him. And he's lucky we're blood, lol. On a side note I am going to Joo's house tomorrow, and spending the night. I'm gonna be reading BTP most of hte time so it should be shwayt. ok I'm out talk to you ALL later hopefully lol

       How is everyone? Lol, first off sorry Vic, I couldn't get a hold of Juan to see if he wanted to go down there. Secondly, I would like to note that right now I am listening to Feel by Zug Izland (go to my xanga to see the importance of that song). But yeah, I can't wait for Monday, going to Wet n Wild with the Joo. Maybe get to meet some new people. That would be cool. So yeah, I just wanted to pop in and update this mother, lol. I'll talk to you ALL soon. Bye

       Ok, so yeah. My first official post. Yeah, this summer sucks so far and it doesn't really look like it is getting any better. The latest problem of mine: Juan doesn't want to hang out with me anymore because I am too "depressing". Well, fuck him, I am not depressing. Oh sure, I am a little low b/c of this whole Laura situation but that is about it. And who is he to say who is depressing? But whatever, I really don't care. Like Vic suggested, I'm just going to carry on with my life.&nbsp; Oh yeah, I emailed my sister last night about the USMC, and I basically shocked her. She called here at 8:00 am just to talk to me about it. And all she really said were the obvious things. Like the fact that I have to go to college, that USMC is the hardest branch to get into, and all that good stuff. But carrying on, my eye is fucking bothering me all to hell. Even these prescription eye drops don’t help, but oh well. I’ll live, lol. Yesterday I got my package from Jojo; complete with pics and 5 blank cds, 4 of which I could do w/e I want lol. But yeah, I still haven’t gotten a hold of Laura yet. Bummer/10 but there is nothing I can really do about it I might just end up emailing her about what’s been going through my mind, which most of you know by now. Subject change (I am just bouncing all around). Monday me and The Joo are going to Wet n Wild. It plans to be fun. But lately whenever I have a plan it always fucks up. Also, TwiztedKlown from CDT is going to be emailing me Behind the Paint, and in return I am going to burn him a copy of bmh. A fair trade in my eyes (even if one is fucked up). But yeah, a lot of drama going on, and I’m out.

I'm gonna see her tuesday at Scandia, tis going to be fun. Then I think we are going to see Harold and Kumar go to White Castle wednesday. I haven't seen a pic of her yet really lol. BUT I have talked to her on the phone (2 hours collect), and she has a very beautiful voice. GOD DAMN YOU MONTANA!!!!! um !!! But yeah, sh's seen my blondie pics from Jojo's site and says I have a cute laugh lol. Damn, I am too damn happy right now so soon after I told the girl I loved that I no longer want to speak to her. But I don't care, Hannah makes me happy and to me right now, in the present, that's all that matters. Lol, one more thing before I go, I like tic tacs, lol.
