              To Let Go         Tiffany Appleton  To let go isn’t to forget, not think about, or ignore. It doesn’t leave feelings of anger, jealousy or regret. Letting go isn’t winning and it isn’t losing. It’s not about pride and it’s not about how you appear, And it’s not obsessing or dwelling on the past. Letting go isn’t blocking memories or thinking sad thoughts, And doesn’t leave emptiness, hurt or sadness. It’s not giving in or giving up. Letting go isn’t about loss, and it’s not defeat.  To let go is to cherish memories, but to overcome and to move on. It is having an open mind and confidence in the future. Letting go is accepting,  It is learning and experiencing and growing. To let go is to be thankful for the experiences that made you laugh, made you cry and made you grow. It’s about all that you have, all that you had and all that you will soon gain. Letting go is having the courage to accept change, and the strength to keep moving. Letting go is growing up. It is realizing that the heart can sometimes be the most potent remedy. To let go is to open a door, to clear a path and to set your-self free.

I will give up.. n give her my blessings.. for we wont be made for each other again... there were flaws.. n e flaws will remain.. dis past relationship can only be a memory.. on e other hand.. how I wish.. I could have a hidden past.. or suffer from memory loss tt will erase this relationship.. if I can.. I do not wanna tink abt her anymore.. if I can.. I wld choose not to love her.. I dun wanna be reminded of her anymore.. I wan to forget her.. forget everything about her.. n start afresh.. I wanna disappear from her life.. I won't be there for her anymore.. I do not wanna see her too.. I'm sorry.. I tink this is e only way for me to move on.. u tk care.. If one day, we are fated to meet on e streets.. wad will I do.. jus pretend that we nv knew each other.. smile n walk away.. stare n walk past each other.. or will we stop n talk..? I do not know.. n I do not hope for such a day..

      well... disastrous day.. though i jus finished my exams.. ironic rite.. haha.. my fren jus fell out of love.. n I went to accompany her.. hrmm.. den we went to town since its e most 'walkable' place in sg.. haha.. SG is jus so small n boring.. haha.. she helped me do one of my econs essay.. haha.. gotta pia finish 3 of em.. sian.. den we were at far east.. den got to knw tt J also coming to town n far east.. got excited.. really wanted to see her.. its been quite long.. also forget when was e last time i saw her.. den when i saw her... its kinda shocking.. cos she highlighted her hair! when i TOT she hated dying hair.. I TOT la.. n she changed her hairstyle.. n wore skirt.. hrmm.. its kinda like a NEW her.. whom im not familiar with.. well.. den came e indian... which her appearance was totally unexpected.. cos J told me she meeting her sec sch classmate.. n I jus turned my back on her n walked off.. which my fren commented was ungentleman.. i dun giv a damn abt it.. so.. shattered.. e day when i see dem togt finally came.. e feeling suck.. it jus suck... if I knew i wld see tt indian.. I wldnt wan to see her at all.. it broke my heart once more... especially when I knew abt e facts.. hai.. damn.. if I had a choice.. I wldnt mind to hv dis r/s to b erased off my mind.. forever... treat it like it has nv ever happened.. n let me start all over again.. its gonna be a yr.. n im still stuck in dis ordeal.. dey say time heals.. but time doesnt change anything for me.. im still fighting hard against e feeling of wanting her back.. back to my life.. resisting e urge to msg her everytime.. it still happens.. time din do anything.. hai.. n i realised.. Im not as tolerant as I tot i am when i see her wif tt indian today.. feelings of jealousy n sadness... total destruction to my day.. sigh. why do people say love nv fails? it has failed me so many times... till.. i duno wad is love... can it be eaten.. I rather it can be eaten.. digested.. n passed out.. den it'll leave me easily.. rather than being stuck wif me.. e feeling of entrapment.. is a feature of gothic tradition.. haha.. sigh. does she knw tt I still love her.. n tt feeling nv changed at all... does she knw.. tt she's still e most impt person to me.. does she knw.. I want her to share all my joys and sorrows.. does she knw.. she's e motivation of my life.. does she knw.. tt I work hard cos of her.. cos I wanna provide for her in e future.. does she knw.. does she knw at all... or does she care.. does she care... freak... my fren jus told me dis... "In the arithmetic of love, one plus one equals everything, and two minus one equals nothing." its so true.. nothing... without her in my life.. I feel so empty.. her birthday is coming.. dis yr.. I wldnt be e one who's gonna spend her bdae wif her.. its someone else.. e indian.. sigh.. I cant escape frm it too.. since SG is so 'big'.. we'll jus meet into each other every few weeks or so.. moreover.. she's goin NYP.. which e distance is not even like 10m away frm AJ.. hah.. so near yet so far.. so far... sigh.. well.. dun wanna type le.. sian..

I was always so close to killing her when having discussions.. haha.. she jus speaks in such a soft volume tt u need to listen to her so carefully to hear anything.. n e reason she gave was she was conscious abt her voice.. oh man..

      feeling so free these days.. mainly cos I've finished all my work tts gonna be due for submission.. but I haven started on my revision.. heh.. well well.. there's still time.. heh.. I'll write abt it when I dun hv enuff time.. =) its gonna be a yr since I last broke up wif J.. dun exactly remember e date when we broke up.. only know its in august.. nearing promos.. I wonder.. how did I managed to survive/struggle thru dis ordeal.. dis misery.. dis hurt tt had carved so deep in my heart.. how did I pull thru.. how did I managed to get by.. during e past yr when she's not wif me.. did I really become a better person? happier? am I who I want to be... I dun really know.. when she's not wif me.. I feel empty.. I feel alone.. I dun feel love.. I dun hv faith.. I dun hv trust.. I've lost motivation in almost everything.. I feel like I've lost it all.. frankly.. e past yr.. was indeed a torture to me.. e misery was so intense.. never a moment was I not sad.. even when I win matches.. she's not there to share my joy.. which made me feel incomplete.. sigh.. I feel incomplete.. no matter how hard I work.. no matter wad I've acheived.. I've always hoped tt she will be there to share wif me everything.. but she's not.. when she's wif me.. I feel love.. I feel happiness every now n den.. even when I had my lousiest ball day.. gotten e worst results in e class.. I wun giv a shit.. cos she's there.. jus to see her will brighten up my day.. will mk every disappointment n sorrow disappear.. n jus mk me feel.. so happy.. n without fear.. sigh.. but she's no longer there.. truly, I miss  her ..

        If you want to go to places, start from where you are.     If you are poor, start with something cheap.     If you are uneducated, start with something relatively simple.     If you live in a poor environment, and poverty makes markets small, start with something small.     If you are unemployed, start using labour power, because any productive use of it is better than letting it lie idle.
