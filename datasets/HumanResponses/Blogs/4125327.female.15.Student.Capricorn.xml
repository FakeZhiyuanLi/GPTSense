      Hello! Yeah, umm, I didn't come here yesterday... sorry. Umm, I babysat Sammy (cousin) last night and tonight I'm going to a party. Nothing big, just some of the girls from sunday school gettin' together, playing games and eating pizza. I need to keep in mind how many slices I have, you see, I'm tring to loose weight. Being 215 isn't fun. I guess it's better than 225; that's was what I was before the diet thing. I'm doing it in a healthy way, don't worry. It's based on porportions, and I can eat anything I want, but the more unhealthy it is, the less I can have of it. I lost the ten pounds in the first two weeks, but sorta just stayed at that point. Give or take a pound. I hate it when girls at school or even church complain that they gained a pound, or even two! Oh my goodness! It's the end of the world! Now they can't eat for two weeks! People, you can't even tell. Get over it, or at least, don't take your 90 pound self to  me  and complain. Anyway. Well, that was enough, I guess. Have fun! ~U.D.b.a.F.o.G.

      Hey! Well, today was packed with events. I woke up at a decent time, around eight. Hey that's better than like, ten. Siblings were a pain, making messes all day. No biggie though. My older sis called, she's doing fine. She's in the army... learning Arabic (sp?). It's also my older brother's birthday. 26 today. He's planning on coming down in early September, the third, and she is planning on coming the same time. She's 23. Saw Katie today, at church. The reason she hasn't been answering the phone or e-mails, is because she's grounded because of that thing I semi-menchened yesterday. I know that all sin is equal in the eyes of God, but you know, not in earthy eyes. And some have bigger conquences than others. Sure, she didnt get any of the conquences (besides a major grounding) but... still. rAy was great today at church. We only got through three verses, but the message was awsome. I'm going to miss him when he leaves. He talked about Galations 6:1-3. How we all are overcomed by sin at one point or another, no matter who we are. But, we tend to (symboticaly) smack them with bats instead of going to them gently and humbly to try and help them. Anyway, your sister in Christ, ~U.D.b.a.F.o.G.

       Wow. Today I made a new blog. Well, duh, obviously. I'm babysitting my annoying little siblings right now. A boy (10) and a girl (7). He is reading over my shoulder, which means I'll have to wait ''til later to type in the good stuff.
