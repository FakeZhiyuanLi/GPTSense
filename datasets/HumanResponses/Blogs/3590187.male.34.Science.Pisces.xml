      The following Lasers are what I consider the premiere lasers for hair removal.  Not in any order of preference.  Though similar lasers exist from other companies, these are the bigger players in the laser hair removal industry.   urlLink Lumenis  Lumenis makes the very popular LightSheer laser based on 810nm diode technology.  The LightSheer is specifically designed for hair removal.  This laser also has some of the most extensive  urlLink clinical research  demonstrating its effectiveness for permanent hair reduction.  The LightSheer uses contact cooling via a Sapphire lens to maintain epidermal cooling.  The LightSheer has a 144 square millimeter spot size.  No gels are required for treatment.  Treatment pain is considered moderate and depends on the individual, the location, the energy applied and the pulse duration.   urlLink Candela  Candela makes the popular GentleLase laser.  The GentleLase was also build specifically for removing hair.  Its large 254 square millimeter spot size allows for fast treatment of large skin areas.  The GentleLase is based on the 755nm Alexandrite laser.  It uses a Cryogen spray (a cold fine mist) to cool the skin surface.  No gels are required for treatment.  Treatment pain is considered moderate and depends on the individual, the location, the energy applied and the pulse duration.   urlLink Cutera (previously known as Altus)  Cutera makes the CoolGlide family of hair removal lasers.  Just like the Lumenis LightSheer and Candela GentleLase, the CoolGlide has been cleared by the FDA for permanent hair reduction on all skin types and tanned patients.  The CoolGlide uses a Nd:YAG laser with a 1064nm wavelength.  This wavelength allows for deeper penetration into the dermis when compared to the LightSheer and GentleLase, but doesn't show the specificity for melanin that the LightSheer and GentleLase do.  It has shown more promise in treating darker and tanned skin than the GentleLase and LightSheer.

       urlLink Full Tutorial on Laser Hair Removal from Emedicine   The following are FAQs with regard to the LightSheer Laser system made by Lumenis, the world's largest maker of hair removal lasers.  How does the LightSheer system remove hair?  This laser targets the pigment located in the hair follicle and shaft. The light is absorbed by the pigment in the hair follicle and this energy is converted to heat which results in damage to the hair follicle. This damage causes delayed re-growth of the hair, and in most cases permanent destruction of many of the hair follicles. Unlike electrolysis, which kills one hair follicle at a time, the laser reaches and treats hundreds of follicles at a time.  Is it safe? The LightSheer system was developed from years of research at the Wellman Laboratories of Photomedicine, one of the world's leading medical laser research institutions. The laser is pulsed, or "turned on," for only a fraction of a second and the duration of each pulse is just long enough to disable the hair follicles. A unique component of the LightSheer system, the actively cooled sapphire handpiece, was designed to protect the skin by actively cooling it before, during and after the laser light is transmitted. It also actively draws off heat from the skin surface, which further protects the skin from injury.  Does it hurt?  The cooling tip has a mild anesthetic property, which allows tender areas to be treated in a relatively painless fashion. You may feel a tingling or stinging sensation during the treatment, but most people tolerate the procedure well. Topical anesthetic is available to increase your comfort, if you choose. Following your treatment, you may experience a sunburn-type sensation in the treated area for several hours.   What affects the look of body hair? Age, ethnicity, medication, hormone levels, and body site influence the length, coarseness and color of body hair. How much hair you have depends on how many hairs are in the active growth phase, and how long that phase lasts.  How many treatments will I need?  Interestingly, not all hairs are actively growing at the same time. They actually go through three distinct phases: growth, regression, and resting. The LightSheer works by disabling hair that is principally in the active growth phase at the time of treatment. Since other hairs will enter this active growth phase at different times, additional treatments may be necessary to disable all hair follicles in a given area. Treatments are usually given at intervals of 8-12 weeks, depending on the particular area of the body being treated and the density of the hair in that area. Our staff will work with you to develop the best program that fulfills your needs.  Are the results permanent? The LightSheer causes permanent hair reduction and delayed regrowth of the treated hair follicles. A long-term clinical study was done to evaluate the LightSheer Diode Laser for hair removal. Of 92 patients, all had temporary hair loss and 89% had long-term hair loss. Also, regrowing hairs were shown to be thinner and lighter than previously. Because the laser tends to treat hair follicles that are in an active growth phase, more than one treatment will be required to disable hair follicles that subsequently enter this growth phase. However, one treatment may result in a significant enough improvement that it may be all you desire or require.  What happens after treatment? Within several minutes, the treated area may become slightly red and puffy. This reaction usually subsides quickly and returns to normal within a day or so. Depending on the area treated you should plan work or social engagements accordingly. Around day 3-7 after treatment you may experience what seems to be regrowth of hair. Actually, most of these hairs are being shed as a result of your treatment and are not regrowing. In-between treatments you should not wax or pluck your hairs but it is permissible to shave.  Who is a good candidate for the LightSheer laser? The ideal candidate for most hair removal lasers has dark hair and light skin. Darker hairs absorb more of the laser light, and lighter skin allows more transmission of the laser light into the hair follicle. Although dark or tanned skin may run a higher risk of pigmentation changes following the procedure, the LightSheer's unique longer wavelength at 810nm allows treatment of all but the darkest-skinned patients. No other hair removal lasers have this property.
