      The Pentagon  urlLink aborts  the idea of a "terror betting market".  So much for using all the weapons at our disposal to combat terrorists.  As I mentioned before, this could do no worse than the Homeland Security department - there was absolutely NO reason to squash this what so ever.    Shame on the Democrats who raised a fuss over this - and shame on you who won't support it.

      Ok,  urlLink this  is weird.  Aren't we still investigating "insider trades" of airlines et al that took place right before 9/11?  As much as the Gov't says they won't use the information, 1) it's being put together by THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE and 2) what if it COULD be useful in preventing attacks?  This doesn't invade anyones privacy, so what if it's tasteless IMNSHO.  Ef the pundits - I'm gonna sign up.

      We have now returned to the days of subsidized sodas.  Yes folks, you heard me clearly.   I just got an email from the  President   (apparently he has nothing better to do  *eek*) of my company.  He wanted to "address the concerns" of a "number of us" - and that we will be returning to the days of subsidized cola.  Sodas are once again $.25, when they used to be $.50.  Remind me again, who's paying for this?  What I'd like to see is everyone who bitched about $.50 sodas get their "subjective" bonus reduced to $0.  (See article on Vieques below) Then again, I'm not running the shop.  At the suggestion of my good friend Patrick, we came to the conclusion that every time I order a soda from the vending machine, I will deposit the other quarter on my Presidents desk (who is, per chance a staunch objectivist).  I think he'll approve.  :)  Oh yes, and here is Rob's response:  The President of your company took time out of his day to make this?  Umm, maybe it's me, but wouldn't that time have been better spent generating revenue, doing deals, getting things done!!!...in order to continue this subsidized soda pool.   Oh and as for the people complaining - why do I have a feeling that these are the folks that shouldn't really be drinking suger loaded carbonated drinks to begin with. Do they also complain that the soda machine is too far away, and that the candy machine doesn't have enough selection.   ^ Give that man a  urlLink cookie !  Rob nailed it on the head.

       urlLink For those of you who DIDN'T already know this...   Worth reading (re: the article)  urlLink Hatreds Kingdom  - by Dore Gold  "In recent decades, Wahhabi clerics have preached two forms of jihad against the West: terrorism, and financial jihad, whereby wealthy Saudi philanthropists subsidise terrorist groups under the guise of promoting Islamic causes."  "The decision to withdraw American ground troops from the kingdom suggests that Saudi Arabia's strategic importance is now outweighed by the vulnerability of forces stationed there to terrorist attack. Post-Ba'athist Iraq offers similar geopolitical advantages and oil reserves, without the drawback of tying Washington's hands."  The continued leaks of information like this lead me to believe the current administration is setting themselves up for an "excuse" ceremony - as in "It's out of my hands, YOU (the House of Saud) now have to deal with the anger of America".  You made your bed, YOU sleep in it a$$holes.

      Well, we're all aware that America is footing the bill for the entirety of the Iraqi intervention.  We've requested assistance from the international community to help alleviate the cost, to a luke warm (if not cold) reception.   urlLink This article  seems to indicate France has some interest in helping re-build Iraq.    There's a whole bunch I could write about this, and might, later - but what I wanted this to be about was, wouldn't it be better for France, in the long run, to make us go it alone?  I mean, they didn't support this thing in the first place, by them helping us now, isn't it sort of positive feedback (along the lines of, "Well, we don't approve, but here's the cookie anyways, now run along and go invade some other country").  At least, that's how I see it.  By providing assistance in the form of funds and manpower, they have freed up OUR troops to go off and do OUR Presidents bidding.  I don't intend to make a point of this, I just find it interesting.

       urlLink USS Clueless - Decompressing Iraq :   "And that means we're beginning to win the war. This was the real reason for conquering Iraq. This is our best strategic weapon against the extremists who attacked us. Their power is in their ideas, their beliefs, and basic to them is a dedication to uniformity and central control, of submission of the masses to the will of the few. We counter that with our idea about individual liberty, and our idea is better. I believe that it's better ethically and esthetically. Societies based on our idea are more productive in nearly every way. And our idea is more competitive memetically. Our idea is more seductive, more attractive. Against it they have little defense."  That is just one excerpt of a well written, most excellent piece by Mr. den Beste.   Kudos and I'd hope my 2 regular readers would take a peek at the entire article.  ;)

       urlLink Kyoto  - and why Russia might 'pull out'.    I didn't realize there was an $80 billion potential market for the Russians if the US had agreed to the terms of the 1997 Kyoto Agreement.  Basically, that means that without the US, Russia loses $80 Bn over the next couple years - monies that would have come from US companies buying "surplus environmental credits" from Russian companies.  Where's their incentive now, now that the $80 Bn handout is gone?  Interesting, very interesting.

      From  urlLink Forbes , an op-ed predicting the EU is heading down the tubes.  I think some major societal changes across the pond would be a good thing - though I do think it would foster even MORE anti-Americanism, as their ego tells them their "better quality of life" is what makes them superior to us.  When that comes crashing down, I can see some angry political types coming into power.  *shrugs*  Maybe I'm just a pessimist.

      Thats right folks, one meeting and one hour left before I'm done for the weekend.  Leaving for Vegas about 30 minutes after I get out of here.  Sooooooooo excited, never been to Vegas before, and the more I hear about it, the more excited I get.  Probably why I'm not doing a damn lick of work - I can't WAIT to LEAVE!  Heheh.  Big props out to P and Lori (the roommates) for arranging this thing!    Check out  urlLink P's blog .  Have a great weekend everyone!

      I interpret  urlLink this  article as indicative of a greater societal trend - heading towards a "big brother" style of Gov't.  If you look at the psychology of markets, as well as individuals, the trend we've seen as of late with markets wildly gyrating at the smallest sneeze from Greenspan, is rather disturbing.  I mean, if these people don't have their own ideas of where markets are headed, the people we pay MILLIONS for their opinions, how good can that be?    This is one of the reasons I didn't get into investment management right out of college - something I'd primped myself for for a long time.  It really is a load of hogwash.  If you have a math degree, and can model, you're the same off as the next guy (once you get to a certain point).  Investors have been relying less and less on MARKET and COMPANY fundamentals, and more on playing the guessing game of "whats the Fed gonna do", "where's the next big hit gonna be".  Folks, they are guessing games.    It all comes back to todays society, the "gimme gimme's" and "I want it now!now!NOW!".  Everyone wants to get rich quick, take a ride down easy street.  The stock market, and increasingly other financial "vehicles" are seen ever more as the means to the end.  This ideology was what led to the boom of the late 90's, and I'm concerned that the bubble hasn't really popped.  If that's the case, we should REALLY be concerned, as whats held up the economy over the last year (refinancing equity out of homes) - is eroding, and the erosion will continue and accelerate as rates increase.    So, maybe the Fed IS onto something.  But the flip side to that is, you can't manipulate a market forever, again, as we saw in the late 90's  :|

Just know, kufr, that it is only a matter of time until we conquer the mighty Zionist bus, and it is then that we shall turn our attention to the imperialist American bicycle.

       urlLink Marjorie Cohn ! is! an! idiot!  The true ideology behind the ICC is to castrate the US on behalf of the UN.  In effect, what the ICC would allow would be any pissant country who has beef with the US, to sue our President and Commanding Generals in an international court, where the US is bound to be unpopular.  What Ms. Cohn neglects to mention is that Billy Bob Clinton was the President who expressed interest in this originally, but even he felt the US should have some exemptions as we are the de facto world policeman.  Kind of like, when a cop has to go 100 mph to catch you speeding on the highway, he doesn't get a speeding ticket type shit.    Its people like this woman, who REALLY piss me off.  She can't even see the implications of what she's writing about - all she cares about is humbling the US at any cost.  She rails against the US pulling military support for countries who support this - I'd say, "Why SHOULDN'T we you bitch?".  Most of these countries provide us absolutely nothing, if they try to fuck us with the ICC decision, yeah, we should pull our military support for them.  What Marjorie wants is a world where the US protects everyone elses interests but our own - what a fuck wit.

      The UN has a  urlLink dismal history  of offering "assistance" to US troops.  Excerpts below:  "It was the United Nations that was kicked around by insurgents in Somalia a decade ago, with a U.N. combat force pinned down at the Mogadishu airport until American Marines arrived. And it was a U.N. peacekeeping force in Bosnia that in 1995 was overrun by rampaging Serb troops who took some peacekeepers hostage, then stormed down the road into Srebrenica — which was under official U.N. protection — and massacred some 8,000 Muslims."  " The Europeans, arriving for duty in 130-degree heat, “have no ice chests, water coolers, maps, vehicles, tables, chairs, cots, etc. We gave them everything we could to include two Humvees,” the American officer wrote in a private communication to his family."  ^ Smart

"They have the opportunity to work with us and the Iraqis."

      More sickening  urlLink media bias  can be found here.  Want to know what I'm talking about?  Do your homework.  The current environmental policy calls for, if any retrofits are to be made, an ENTIRE overhaul of every system at a plant - making it fiscally impossible to do, so nobody does it.  Any small retrofit would trigger the rest of a plan needing an overhaul.  Ok, that was the old system.  The NEW/proposed law would allow plant operators to retrofit anything they wanted, one thing at a time.  Thus, eliminating the cost burden, and making it MUCH more likely that they'll do ANYTHING.    In my world, this equates to the "old" system of rent control in santa monica.  Under the old system, rent increases for new and existing tenants were limited to some inflationary factor.  This led to people living on the beach and paying $400/month - where as landlords expenses were exceeding that inflationary factor, thereby eating into the spare cash flow the property generated.  Thus DIS-incentivizing landlords from investing any capital items (carpets, paint, renovations) into the property: 1) b/c someone will always rent it and 2) they can't support it financially.  Why spend $$ on carpets, if SOMEONE will live there, and you can't recoup the cost anyway.    Long story longer, the State amended that law, and said, on turnover (when a new tenant moves in) you can charge whatever is considered "market" at that time.  So, we were seeing rents jump from $400 on that waterfront property, to (after redecoration) $2,000+.  Shit, some 3 bed/3 bath units in Samo go for $13,000+!  Under the new legislation of course.    To dismiss the gentrification issue, as long as tenants don't move out, their rents don't change.  So, voila, diversity.    SSDD for this power issue.  By making financially irresponsible policy (environmental act imposed under Clinton) one is able to assuage the masses.  While the law looks great on paper, never is it enacted in the "real world" b/c it kills shareholder value in one fell swoop.  By allowing utility providers this NEW option, it allows them to remain profitable, and keep their constituency happy by letting them invest in their PP&E.    The Green party is a bunch of friggin idiots.

Since this is going to prove detrimental to their "cause", it will be OK to assume that the omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent  urlLink  JOOs  are to blame.    And if you were curious, I'm in the camp of "moderate muslims have to get fed up with the extremists in order for anything we do to succeed", so blowing up hospitals should hopefully serve as a catalyst to the moderates.

      Yes,  urlLink this  would rank high on the "suck-age" scale.  Of course China is the main threat - just funny it's coming in the form of economic pressure (look at our trade gaps, and there's talk of them denominating international trades in terms of the euro, which would SEVERELY hurt the strength of the dollar.  Put it this way, what if all of a sudden you had this commodity that only you made, then, over night, 1/2 your demand just went *poof*.  International companies/countries DEMAND US$ to conduct business - it's stable, it's not going to devalue overnight (like in 1998 with the Russian debt crisis).  Blah.    In addition to the economic pressures, we're also seeing Generals (so consider the source) in the last couple years, publicly state China as the next foreign aggressor, and that they are worried about the future implications of all this shit.    In conclusion, the one thing I have to give Clinton credit for was helping China into the WTO - that is the one way we can subtlely coerce them towards capitalism, and AWAY from M.A.D. (mutually assured destruction).

      An open invitation to any, past, present, or future girlfriends  :D  Read  urlLink this , often.  And specifically (re: good side effects of (oral) sex): "Better teeth: Seminal plasma contains zinc, calcium and other minerals shown to retard tooth decay. Since this is a family Web site, we will omit discussion of the mineral delivery system. Suffice it to say that it could be a far richer, more complex and more satisfying experience than squeezing a tube of Crest--even Tartar Control Crest. Researchers have noted, parenthetically, that sexual etiquette usually demands the brushing of one's teeth before and/or after intimacy, which, by itself, would help promote better oral hygiene. "  -or- But is there such a thing as too much sex?  The answer, in purely physiological terms, is this: If you're female, probably not.  -and- American psychologist Gordon Gallup reported that sexually active participants whose male partners did not use condoms were less subject to depression than those whose partners did. One theory of causality: Prostoglandin, a hormone found only in semen, may be absorbed in the female genital tract, thus modulating female hormones.

      And guess what the birthday fairy brought me?  A nice case of  FOOD POISONING !  Hah!   So I was sittin in work yesterday, the day after my actual B-day, feeling kinda dizzy/funny/puke-ish when I decided I probably shouldn't be there and should go home.  First time in three years with my company that I'd come to that conclusion, so you know it's serious.  Or maybe you didn't but I did.    On the way home, I almost pass out four or five times, so damn tired, for no good reason.  Once I DO get home, I DO actually pass out, cold sweat, shivering, only waking up a couple times to run to the bathroom and puke up some phlegm and blood (Mmmmmmmmm: phlegm).   Decided it was in both my, and my toilets, best interest to go to the Doc at  urlLink Patricks  forceful suggestion.    Blood tests are coming back later, but doc says best case, food poisoning, worst case, appendix (hence the blood tests).  The appendix is apparently less than a 2% chance, but hey, don't really need it anyway - hah.  I'm not worried.  On another note, I see my traffic went to the "moon" (relative term - heh) today, so I checked out my b-stats and it seems I made  urlLink Don's   urlLink front page !   Woo hoo!  Don's a great guy, got a good head on his shoulders (an objectivist) and has a  urlLink good sense of humor  - check him out!   Oh yeah, and I share a name with a childhood bully of his, we both got a kick out of that.

      Well, I'm heading to Yosemite this weekend, solo camping trip. Check out some of the  urlLink wildlife safety  items they have listed.  :/  lol  My favorite:  What should you do if you meet a mountain lion?   Never approach a mountain lion especially one that is feeding or with kittens. Most mountain lions will try to avoid confrontation. Always give them a way to escape.   Don't run. Stay calm. Hold your ground or back away slowly. Face the lion and stand upright. Do all you can to appear larger. Grab a stick. Raise your arms. If you have small children with you, pick them up.  If the lion behaves aggressively, wave your arms, shout and throw objects at it. The goal is to convince it that you are not prey and may be dangerous yourself.  If attacked, fight back!   Generally, mountain lions are calm, quiet, and elusive. The chance of being attacked by a mountain lion is quite low compared to many other natural hazards. There is, for example, a far greater risk of being struck by lightning than being attacked by a mountain lion. +++++ Of course, I'd prefer to just shoot the fucker.  However, I think I'll wind up in jail if I do.  Well, I'm off to buy a 12" fixed blade.  :b

       urlLink Heh .  In response to my  urlLink previous post  from a couple days ago.  They make some great points that a LOT more work/sweat is going to be needed before the literal liberal media stranglehold is loosened (let alone broken), though I think that what is important is the direction we are headed (for now) and our relative effectiveness if you will.  To have gotten this far in the first place, I'd equate to having slipped under the radar.  I mean, whoever thought someone from  AM radio  would start this big of a snowball.     In any case,  this whole thing feels really entrepreneurial  - and frankly, I wouldn't have it any other way.    Plus, you only have to ask Bill Gates once when the best time to get in on anything is.

      First off, and off-topic, I wonder why it is I do most of my clear thinking while driving into work.  *shrugs*  In any case, we've talked before about how the "angry left" is a relatively new phenomenon.  In recent memory (at least to my knowledge, which is admittedly limited) there has never been such a partisan (and polarizing) difference in the "opposing political elements" as it were.  I mean, we see Democrats going against every measure this administration tries to push through - whether it be Medicare reform, which the Dems are against b/c it steals their thunder with the retirees, to Iraq, which the Dems really don't have any plan for anyways, besides to bash Bush, and hope more soldiers are killed so it "sends a message" to "wake up" the US public (assuming that the US public are the ones who need "waking up" of course).  We see repeated filibusters of judicial nominees on strictly partisan grounds - in some cases even referring to prestigious acclaimed judicial nominees as "neanderthals".  Has 1/2 of our major political system been relegated to name-calling?  Seriously Teddy Kennedy, whats with the hate speech?  In other circles, we see protestors lining up with Mao'ists, socialists, communists, greenpeace activists and their ilk in support of murderous tyrannical dictators and despots.  I wonder if any of them actually know that the Communist "revolution" actually killed many more innocents than did the Nazi's.  And what would be worse, their knowing support of that, or their ignorance (actually it's ignorance either way you cut it).   What we see with ALL of these acts is a willingness to refute REALITY in order to further an impotent political agenda.  Many of us in the blogosphere talk about how AM radio and conservative talk shows are the crux of the new conservative movement in the US.  Al Gore recognizes this, and is in the process of trying to acquire a media license so he can start his own liberal talk show.  Conservatives typically mock this idea for a number of reasons, primarily however due to the fact that a liberal will NEVER win an argument with an informed, intelligent conservative.  Liberal arguments are based on feelings, everything from gun control legislation to pro-choice campaigns.  Their arguments are shown to be false under fastidious fact-checking and OBJECTIVE research.  One of the reasons the blogosphere is so important is b/c it is able to reveal (as an "independent third party") the mistruths and spin that EITHER party uses to further its agenda.  My contention from the drive in this morning is that the angry left isn't actually a new phenomenon, it is more of a by product of this conservative revolution we're seeing.  Rush Limbaugh is credited with acting as a catalyst of this movement, but consider what there was before him - no opposing view point to tender any assertion made by liberals.  With the advent of blogging, which is clearly dominated by the conservative stand point, and the ever strengthening influence of AM radio, what we are seeing is not a shift, but an  awakening  almost.  Many people who just sat back on the sidelines watching the liberal political circus are now speaking up.  The fact that conservatives have recently taken over control of the Office of the President, Congress, the House and won a vast majority of Gubernatorial races speaks to this 'awakening' of the American.  This has the looney fringes of the left back on their heels.  For so long they were just an accepted part of the "mainstream left" - but now, the pendulum is swinging and the spectrum has shifted, meanwhile they are out on the fringe finding everything they say/believe in under attack from an emerging column that is gaining momentum.  They've never had fact thrown in their faces to dispute arguments before, and I've got to imagine getting shut down regularly (in a harsh manner) has got to be infuriating.    In summary, the angry left has always been there, now they just have a label, and have been called out for what they are and what we are seeing these days is their natural illogical response to the freight train that is modern conservatism.

Our removal of troops from the Kingdom, combined with strategic embassy closures, mixed with Bush's recent speech where he outlines what the US will and will not stand for basically drew a line in the sand for the Saudi's.  Now, we actually have a statement to point to giving indication as to what the US's official policy will be towards the Saudi's and their Wahabbist views which they have been spreading for YEARS.

(2003-11-17) -- John Allen Muhammad, convicted today of murder in the 2002 D.C.-area shooting spree, will receive the death penalty "to be administered by a firing squad at some unspecified time in the future."  After sentencing, Mr. Muhammad was released from custody, given a car, $20 in cash and instructions to stop at a local gas station on his way home.   The four-man firing squad carrying high-powered rifles left the courthouse shortly after Mr. Muhammad and appeared to be following his car.

       urlLink Rushs first on-air comments :   And most importantly, IMSHO:  "I have to do what's best for me if I'm to succeed at this. I can no longer anticipate what I think people want and try to give that to them. I can no longer try to live my life by making other people happy. I can no longer turn over the power of my feelings to anybody else, which is what I have done a lot of my life. I have thought that I had to be this way or that way in order to be liked or appreciated or understood - and in the process, I denied myself who I was and I denied the other people I was talking to and relating with who I really am, and that isn't good. "  and...  "You can boil it down to one real simple essence: I can't be responsible for anybody's happiness but my own, and if I allow somebody else the power to determine my happiness, then...well...that's something I don't want to do. I can't do any longer. I put myself first. Doesn't mean be rudely selfish. It just means I can't depend on other people to make me happy. I have to do that myself. I'm the only one who has control over that. And I have to admit that I am powerless over this addiction that I have. I used to think I could beat it with force of will. I used to think that I would be different, but I'm not. "  A lot of people say it, but not a lot of people mean it.  Welcome back Rush, and I wish you the best.

      ...that makes me emo?  I mean, seriously.  Maybe I'm just being moody for some reason - though usually my "moodyness" consists of being very pissed off at everyone and wanting to go shoot something....not tonight though.  Maybe it's the RHCP I'm listening to, maybe it's beer #5 I'm drinking, maybe it's weird shit going on at work, maybe it's weird shit going on in my life, maybe some weird shit that went down is catching up with me.  Maybe it's "Z" - all of the above.  Any way you slice it, I'm not so sure I enjoy remembering what I felt like for 4 years of high school and one of college.    P.S.  Under the Bridge is *still* one of the best songs around.

      Seeing as how this is my first job out of college, and this is my first office with this job, I have reason to celebrate.  Yeah, it only took me three years to get here, but I'm still the youngest in my company with one - so that's cool.   There are a couple downsides to it though:   1) I'm no longer sitting next to the coolest (and hot) admin that I was before, so I don't get to hear her crazy sex stories. 2) My desk space was reduced by approximately 75%.  For those of you who have seem my room/workspace, you know how much I LOOOOVE my desk space.  So, again, that sucks. 3) The office is the smallest on the floor, b/c the guy next to me has the largest non-corner office.   4) The furniture must be from 1912 - and not "oh, its' good antique 1912" - more like "that shit is beat".  Heh.  All things considered though, I think it's going to be a positive thing:  1) Much less distraction with being able to close the door and jam to music. 2) I can now keep cold beer within arms reach 3) I have a window 4) Respect 5) New furniture  6) The set up (less desk space) will force me to organize  Good times, pics forthcoming.

      Had to take this one down, but I liked it, so I'm saving it ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  Duc, in case you didn't know D is what we call a member of the "angry left" - pissed of the president is principaled, pissed off we're in iraq, pissed off at halliburton, pissed off that the economy is turning around. An altruistic, nihilistic, pot smoking, tree hugging hippy. Imagine "Office Space"....  *shrugs*   I dont know what he's trying to prove. If anything. I think he thinks he's smarter than the rest of the board - so he posts cryptic messages that only other pot smoking hippies can understand. In board terms he's relegated to "shit-stirrer" status, b/c, for all intents and purposes, he has nothing else to say, but he's angry damnit.    For reference, other members of the "angry left" have things like this to say:  Quote: I Hope the Bloodshed Continues in Iraq Well, that should bring the bats out of the attic with fangs dripping. I won't be hypocritcal. It is politically correct, particularly in any Dem discussion to hope and pray and feel for our troops and scream "bring them back now". I'm fighting something bigger. I'm a 58 year old broad and I can tell you that what is going on in our country isn't the usual ebb and flow of politics where one party is in power and then another; where the economy goes through ups and downs.......yawn, yawn--just wait a bit and things will turn out peachy keen. That stupid la-la land is over. I realize that not every GI Joe was 100peeercent behind Prseeedent Booosh going into this war; but I do know that that is what an overwhelming number of them and their famlies screamed in the face of protesters who were trying to protect these kids. Well, there is more than one way to be "dead" for your country. They are not only not accompishing squat in Iraq, they are doing crap nothing for the safety, defense of the US of A over there directly. But "indirectly" they are doing a lot. The only way to get rid of this slime bag WASP-Mafia, oil barron ridden cartel of a government, this assault on Americans and anything one could laughingly call "a democracy", relies heavily on what a shit hole Iraq turns into.  They need to die so that we can be free. Soldiers usually did that directly--i.e., fight those invading and harming a country. This time they need to die in defense of a lie from a lying adminstration to show these ignorant, dumb Americans that Bush is incompetent. They need to die so that Americans get rid of this deadly scum. It is obscene, Barbie Bush, how other sons (of much nobler blood) have to die to save us from your Rosemary's Baby spawn and his ungodly cohorts.   AND, they get really REALLY pissed off when they read sites like:   urlLink Healing Iraq   Written by an Iraqi in support of the US "occupation".  And what fires them up most of all is pictures like  urlLink this .  Oh, and one last link from the urlLink  LA Times  - from a reformed lefty who had this to say:   Quote: We put them in those rowboats — we antiwar demonstrators, we sophisticated, smart guys. The war was nearly over when I graduated from high school. But high school students were old enough to demonstrate. They were old enough to feel superior to the fools who were running the government. And they were old enough to have known better. They were old enough to have understood what communist regimes had cost the world in suffering, from the prisons of Havana to the death camps of Siberia. Today we are haunted, in thinking about Iraq, by the fact that a noisy, self-important, narcissistic minority talked the United States into betraying its allies. (Loyalty didn't mean a lot to antiwar demonstrators; honor didn't mean a lot.) We betrayed our allies and hurried home, to introspect. They stayed on, to suffer. We were eager to make love, not war, but the South Vietnamese weren't offered that option. Their alternatives were to knuckle under or die. It was my fault, mine personally; I was part of the antiwar crowd and I'm sorry. But my apology is too late for the South Vietnamese dead. All I can do is join the chorus in shouting, "No more Vietnams!" No more shrugging off tyranny; no more deserting our friends; no more going back on our duties as the strongest nation on Earth.   *************************************** I'll be the one to protect you from  Your enemies and all your demons  I'll be the one to protect you from  A will to survive and a voice of reason  I'll be the one to protect you from  Your enemies and your choices son  One and the same I must isolate you  Isolate and save you from yourself. ***************************************

      This deserves more than just a link, the original can be found on  urlLink Kim DuToits  blog.  We have become a nation of women.  It wasn't always this way, of course. There was a time when men put their signatures to a document, knowing full well that this single act would result in their execution if captured, and in the forfeiture of their property to the State. Their wives and children would be turned out by the soldiers, and their farms and businesses most probably given to someone who didn't sign the document.  There was a time when men went to their certain death, with expressions like "You all can go to hell. I'm going to Texas." (Davy Crockett, to the House of Representatives, before going to the Alamo.)  There was a time when men went to war, sometimes against their own families, so that other men could be free. And there was a time when men went to war because we recognized evil when we saw it, and knew that it had to be stamped out.  There was even a time when a President of the United States threatened to punch a man in the face and kick him in the balls, because the man had the temerity to say bad things about the President's daughter's singing.  We're not like that anymore.   Now, little boys in grade school are suspended for playing cowboys and Indians, cops and crooks, and all the other familiar variations of "good guy vs. bad guy" that helped them learn, at an early age, what it was like to have decent men hunt you down, because you were a lawbreaker.  Now, men are taught that violence is bad -- that when a thief breaks into your house, or threatens you in the street, that the proper way to deal with this is to "give him what he wants", instead of taking a horsewhip to the rascal or shooting him dead where he stands.  Now, men's fashion includes not a man dressed in a three-piece suit, but a tight sweater worn by a man with breasts.  Now, warning labels are indelibly etched into gun barrels, as though men have somehow forgotten that guns are dangerous things.  Now, men are given Ritalin as little boys, so that their natural aggressiveness, curiosity and restlessness can be controlled, instead of nurtured and directed.  And finally, our President, who happens to have been a qualified fighter pilot, lands on an aircraft carrier wearing a flight suit, and is immediately dismissed with words like "swaggering", "macho" and the favorite epithet of Euro girly-men, "cowboy". Of course he was bound to get that reaction -- and most especially from the Press in Europe, because the process of male pussification Over There is almost complete.  How did we get to this?  In the first instance, what we have to understand is that America is first and foremost, a culture dominated by one figure: Mother. It wasn't always so: there was a time when it was Father who ruled the home, worked at his job, and voted.  But in the twentieth century, women became more and more involved in the body politic, and in industry, and in the media -- and mostly, this has not been a good thing. When women got the vote, it was inevitable that government was going to become more powerful, more intrusive, and more "protective" (ie. more coddling), because women are hard-wired to treasure security more than uncertainty and danger. It was therefore inevitable that their feminine influence on politics was going to emphasize (lowercase "s") social security.  I am aware of the fury that this statement is going to arouse, and I don't care a fig.  What I care about is the fact that since the beginning of the twentieth century, there has been a concerted campaign to denigrate men, to reduce them to figures of fun, and to render them impotent, figuratively speaking.  I'm going to illustrate this by talking about TV, because TV is a reliable barometer of our culture.  In the 1950s, the TV Dad was seen as the lovable goofball -- perhaps the beginning of the trend -- BUT he was still the one who brought home the bacon, and was the main source of discipline (think of the line: "Wait until your father gets home!").  From that, we went to this: the Cheerios TV ad.  Now, for those who haven't seen this piece of shit, I'm going to go over it, from memory, because it epitomizes everything I hate about the campaign to pussify men. The scene opens at the morning breakfast table, where the two kids are sitting with Dad at the table, while Mom prepares stuff on the kitchen counter. The dialogue goes something like this:  Little girl (note, not little boy): Daddy, why do we eat Cheerios? Dad: Because they contain fiber, and all sorts of stuff that's good for the heart. I eat it now, because of that. LG: Did you always eat stuff that was bad for your heart, Daddy? Dad (humorously): I did, until I met your mother. Mother (not humorously): Daddy did a lot of stupid things before he met your mother.  Now, every time I see that TV ad, I have to be restrained from shooting the TV with a .45 Colt. If you want a microcosm of how men have become less than men, this is the perfect example.  What Dad should have replied to Mommy's little dig: Yes, Sally, that's true: I did do a lot of stupid things before I met your mother. I even slept with your Aunt Ruth a few times, before I met your mother.  That's what I would have said, anyway, if my wife had ever attempted to castrate me in front of the kids like that. But that's not what men do, of course. What this guy is going to do is smile ruefully, finish his cereal, and then go and fuck his secretary, who doesn't try to cut his balls off on a daily basis. Then, when the affair is discovered, people are going to rally around the castrating bitch called his wife, and call him all sorts of names. He'll lose custody of his kids, and they will be brought up by our ultimate modern-day figure of sympathy: The Single Mom.  You know what? Some women deserve to be single moms.  When I first started this website, I think my primary aim was to blow off steam at the stupidity of our society.   Because I have fairly set views on what constitutes right and wrong, I have no difficulty in calling Bill Clinton, for example, a fucking liar and hypocrite.   But most of all, I do this website because I love being a man. Amongst other things, I talk about guns, self-defense, politics, beautiful women, sports, warfare, hunting, and power tools -- all the things that being a man entails. All this stuff gives me pleasure.  And it doesn't take much to see when all the things I love are being threatened: for instance, when Tim Allen's excellent comedy routine on being a man is reduced to a fucking sitcom called Home Improvement. The show should have been called Man Improvement, because that's what every single plotline entailed: turning a man into a "better" person, instead of just leaving him alone to work on restoring the vintage sports car in his garage. I stopped watching the show after about four episodes.  ("The Man Show" was better, at least for the first season -- men leering at chicks, men fucking around with ridiculous games like "pin the bra on the boobies", men having beer-drinking competitions, and women on trampolines. Excellent stuff, only not strong enough. I don't watch it anymore, either, because it's plain that the idea has been subverted by girly-men, and turned into a parody of itself.)  Finally, we come to the TV show which to my mind epitomizes everything bad about what we have become: Queer Eye For The Straight Guy. Playing on the homo Bravo Channel, this piece of excrement has taken over the popular culture by storm (and so far, the only counter has been the wonderful South Park episode which took it apart for the bullshit it is).  I'm sorry, but the premise of the show nauseates me. A bunch of homosexuals trying to "improve" ordinary men into something "better" (ie. more acceptable to women): changing the guy's clothes, his home decor, his music -- for fuck's sake, what kind of girly-man would allow these simpering butt-bandits to change his life around?  Yes, the men are, by and large, slobs. Big fucking deal. Last time I looked, that's normal. Men are slobs, and that only changes when women try to civilize them by marriage. That's the natural order of things.  You know the definition of homosexual men we used in Chicago? "Men with small dogs who own very tidy apartments."  Real men, on the other hand, have big fucking mean-ass dogs: Rhodesian ridgebacks, bull terriers and Rottweilers, or else working dogs like pointers or retrievers which go hunting with them and slobber all over the furniture.   Women own lapdogs.  Which is why women are trying to get dog-fighting and cock-fighting banned -- they'd ban boxing too, if they could -- because it's "mean and cruel". No shit, Shirley. Hell, I don't like the idea of fighting dogs, either, but I don't have a problem with men who do. Dogs and cocks fight. So do men. No wonder we have an affinity for it.  My website has become fairly popular with men, and in the beginning, this really surprised me, because I didn't think I was doing anything special.  That's not what I think now. I must have had well over five thousand men write to me to say stuff like "Yes! I agree! I was so angry when I read about [insert atrocity of choice], but I though I was the only one."  No, you're not alone, my friend, and nor am I.  Out there, there is a huge number of men who are sick of it. We're sick of being made figures of fun and ridicule; we're sick of having girly-men like journalists, advertising agency execs and movie stars decide on "what is a man"; we're sick of women treating us like children, and we're really fucking sick of girly-men politicians who pander to women by passing an ever-increasing raft of Nanny laws and regulations (the legal equivalent of public-school Ritalin), which prevent us from hunting, racing our cars and motorcycles, smoking, flirting with women at the office, getting into fistfights over women, shooting criminals and doing all the fine things which being a man entails.  When Annika Sorenstam was allowed to play in that tournament on the men's PGA tour, all the men should have refused to play -- Vijay Singh was the only one with balls to stand up for a principle, and he was absolutely excoriated for being a "chauvinist". Bullshit. He wasn't a chauvinist, he was being a man. All the rest of the players -- Woods, Mickleson, the lot -- are girls by comparison. And, needless to say, Vijay isn't an American, nor a European, which is probably why he still has a pair hanging between his legs, and they're not hanging on the wall as his wife's trophy.  Fuck this, I'm sick of it.  I don't see why I should put up with this bullshit any longer -- hell, I don't see why any man should put up with this bullshit any longer.  I don't see why men should have become feminized, accept that we allowed it to happen -- and you know why we let it happen? Because it's goddamned easier to do so. Unfortunately, we've allowed it to go too far, and our maleness has become too pussified for words.  At this point, I could have gone two ways: the first would be to say, "...and I don't know if we'll get it back. The process has become too entrenched, the cultural zeitgeist of men as girls has become part of the social fabric, and there's not much we can do about it."  But I'm not going to do that. To quote John Belushi (who was, incidentally, a real man and not a fucking woman): "Did we quit when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?"  Well, I'm not going to quit. Fuck that. One of the characteristics of the non-pussified man (and this should strike fear into the hearts of women and girly-men everywhere) is that he never quits just because the odds seem overwhelming. Omaha Beach, guys.  I want a real man as President -- not Al Gore, who had to hire a consultant to show him how to be an Alpha male, and french-kiss his wife on live TV to "prove" to the world that he was a man, when we all knew that real men don't have to do that shit.  And I want the Real Man President to surround himself with other Real Men, like Rumsfeld, and Ashcroft, and yes, Rice (who is more of a Real Man than those asswipes Colin Powell and Norman Mineta).  I want our government to be more like Dad -- kind, helpful, but not afraid to punish us when we fuck up, instead of helping us excuse our actions.  I want our government of real men to start rolling back the Nanny State, in all its horrible manifestations of over-protectiveness, intrusiveness and "Mommy Knows Best What's Good For You" regulations.  I want our culture to become more male -- not the satirical kind of male, like The Man Show, or the cartoonish figures of Stallone, Van Damme or Schwartzenegger. (Note to the Hollywood execs: We absolutely fucking loathe chick movies about feelings and relationships and all that feminine jive. We want more John Waynes, Robert Mitchums, Bruce Willises, and Clint Eastwoods. Never mind that it's simplistic -- we like simple, we are simple, we are men -- our lives are uncomplicated, and we like it that way. We Were Soldiers was a great movie, and you know why? Because you could have cut out all the female parts, and it still would have been a great movie, because it was about Real Men. Try cutting out all the female parts in a Woody Allen movie -- you'd end up with the opening and closing credits.)  I want our literature to become more male, less female. Men shouldn't buy "self-help" books unless the subject matter is car maintenance, golf swing improvement or how to disassemble a fucking Browning BAR. We don't improve ourselves, we improve our stuff.  And finally, I want men everywhere to going back to being Real Men. To open doors for women, to drive fast cars, to smoke cigars after a meal, to get drunk occasionally and, in the words of Col. Jeff Cooper, one of the last of the Real Men: "to ride, shoot straight, and speak the truth."  In every sense of the word. We know what the word "is" means.  Because that's all that being a Real Man involves. You don't have to become a fucking cartoon male, either: I'm not going back to stoning women for adultery like those Muslim assholes do, nor am I suggesting we support that perversion of being a Real Man, gangsta rap artists (those fucking pussies -- they wouldn't last thirty seconds against a couple of genuine tough guys that I know).  Speaking of rap music, do you want to know why more White boys buy that crap than Black boys do? You know why rape is such a problem on college campuses? Why binge drinking is a problem among college freshmen?  It's a reaction: a reaction against being pussified. And I understand it, completely. Young males are aggressive, they do fight amongst themselves, they are destructive, and all this does happen for a purpose.  Because only the strong men propagate.  And women know it. You want to know why I know this to be true? Because powerful men still attract women. Women, even liberal women, swooned over George Bush in a naval aviator's uniform. Donald Trump still gets access to some of the most beautiful pussy available, despite looking like a medieval gargoyle. Donald Rumsfeld, if he wanted to, could fuck 90% of all women over 50 if he wanted to, and a goodly portion of younger ones too.  And he won't. Because Rummy's been married to the same woman for fifty years, and he wouldn't toss that away for a quickie. He's a Real Man. No wonder the Euros hate and fear him.  We'd better get more like him, we'd better become more like him, because if we don't, men will become a footnote to history.  ********* Sha-zam.

      Went with my buddy (early in the summer) to rent a couple movies down by his place.  He said he had some late fees on his card (warning sign #1) so could we use mine.  OK, but I made him promise me he'd return them.  Done, no big deal.  About a MONTH later, I start getting calls from Blockbuster that I owe them like $80, from their Newport Beach store.   >  Guess who was resposnsible for that?  Kid never returned the movies.    After playing the blame game for a day or two, with him trying to shift responsibility to his brother, I eventually got him to (supposedly) pay the late fees.  It would appear this event is over.  Then the mail came yesterday.  Wouldn't you know "Credit Protection Association, L.P." sent me an official looking letter, informing me that my account is past due $36.98.  Effing wonderful.  I guess the process is for me to call the store directly, confirm my 'friend' DID ever pay ANY late fee.  Then take it from there.   How lame.  How utterly lame.

      Great  urlLink article  - discusses potential support from French and Russian contingencies.  However, the one item that I found very interesting was this:  "Investigators of the Iraq Survey Group have discovered that in the months before the war, many specific military and civilian defensive measures ordered by Hussein in past conflicts were only partially carried out or were completely ignored. There appears to have been “some kind of breakdown in the structure that was controlling things,"  Yeah, wonder how much our CIA guys and Spec Ops folks had to do with that "breakdown in the structure" responsible for the miscommunication.    Heh.

      Found this on  urlLink Instapundit .  Somebody remind Glenn of one of Lincolns famous quotes:  "To say a sheep has five legs, doesn't make it so".    Same concept applies to "public watch" agencies - just b/c they name themselves something, doesn't mean shit.  Case in point:  I could simply rename my blog to "The best weblog in the Universe", and you know what I'd label you if you believed that...  Sheep.

      So, I arrange my travel to LAX for my flight home.  Shuttle picking me up at 9:30 AM for a 1:10 PM flight.  Should be OK, right?  *BZZZT*   I turn on the TV this morning, "get there 3+ hours early... FOR A DOMESTIC FLIGHT" - and they're not even letting individual cars in - you gotta come in in a shuttle/taxi, or you don't get in.  Fuck.  Why do I get the feeling I'm TOTALLY gonna miss my flight.  This sucks.  In any case, have a great holiday folks.  I might be out of commission till January 3rd if all goes well.  But, if I do get bored, I'll be blogging.  So, until next time...

      Last Friday I went out for a "team dinner" at a local italian restaurant (niiiiiiiiice place).  Being the italian food snob that I am, and not seeing my favorite dish (veal saltimbocca) I asked our server to see if the chef had any idea what it was.  As an alternative, I ordered the lasagna.  Well, I got the saltimbocca, and it was a close second for "best I've ever had" - which is saying a lot.  Well, as I liked it so much, I came back in on Monday AM and was telling someone about " urlLink one of the best damn veal dishes I've ever had " - when this groan eminates from behind me.    Now, I know my stomach makes noises b/c of my ulcer, but, this was no stomach.  I turn around to see our  new admin  giving me the vegetarian " stare of death ".  I immediately start to laugh, knowing full well what this is about, and pose the question, "What are you, a vegan?" - followed by more laughing on my part.  Go ahead, guess the response, it was something like, "Actually.  Yes."  With 200% surety, this was headed downhill.   Fast.  I decided to nip in in the bud and told her that it wasn't even 9:00 yet, and I most certainly was NOT getting in this conversation with her over something as asinine as her dietary preferences.  She went for the rebuttal, "Do you know how they TREAT those baby cows?", and I walked away.  Laughing some more.  And as a parting shot, I sent her a link from our friend over at  urlLink maddox.xmission .  Yes, I know I'm a bastard.  I'm over it, why aren't you?  :P

      Today's new blog (to me) is that of  urlLink lagmonkey . In all my blogroll trolling, I haven't yet come across him - which is a bad thing.   His is more of a traditional blog as far as I can tell - more personal type items. He looks pretty cool to me, spent some time as a Marine - though I'm not sure that goatee is kosher (which most likely means he's out), looks like he listens to some cool music, and he's got me linked with the likes of Anna ( urlLink Primal Purge ) and  urlLink Kim DuToit , which means he's no fan of  urlLink Chomsky . Heh.   Gonna have to check that site out more.  Oh yeah, and his format kicks the shit out of mine. Hah.

Unless of course, they're going to hold the picture as blackmail for some wedding day.  If that's the case, that's pretty damn funny.   EDIT : Or as my astute reader so graciously pointed out,  NADGLA  (North American Duck Girl Love Association) would be more appropos.  Heh.

      Well folks, you can't say I didn't try.  I found one of my all time "happy songs" this weekend, and wanted to share it with you, but alas, it wasn't to be.  The Blogger gods apparently don't like either 1) .mp3 file extensions being shared, 2) being sued by the  urlLink RIAA , 3) DCMA or 4) 7 meg uploads.   Heh.  In any case, if you're so inclined, and have  urlLink Kazaa lite  or bear share or some other p2p hookup - go check out " urlLink VNV Nation - beloved ".  There are only a few songs that simply make me *happy*, and this is one of them.  *sighs*

      Looks like  urlLink Mr. Penis Breath himself  has a new video tape out. Now that you've read that, go re-read that interview with "grimley" from LOTR fame.   Demographics are where its at, and it really is going to be a "clash of the civilizations". The only question is my mind is "when" the powder keg will ignite. Bin Laden hoped 9/11 would serve as catalyst to those ends, I think it was only the lighting of the wick. This "war on terror" isn't going to end in any of our lifetimes for a whole number of reasons.   urlLink Retarded   urlLink religious   urlLink zealots  being the #1 reason.  As  urlLink Marx  put it, religion is the opiate of the masses.  Damn religion. Damn it to hell.

      In response to  urlLink this interview with "Grimley"  from LOTR, I got linked to  urlLink this PDF file  by my R6MN buddy, 2kblueR6.    The first interview doesn't really get "good" until the last paragraph, when he starts talking about the effect of the overtly Christian ethos prevalent in the book.  The most interesting point I found him talking about was his perception of the demographical change that's going to take place in Europe in the next 50-75 years.  Very interesting shit, and VERY insightful given todays idiotic batch of actors/entertainers.  However, that's another post for another day.  I've yet to read the second link, however I have it on good authority that it's worth a rip.      Thanks 2kblue!

      So, yeah, tryin to figure out if i want to go ride the MTB or motorcycle for "lunch".  :)  Yes, I am sick - however I don't feel bad.  But, after getting yelled at for coming to work yesterday (while being sick - we have like 5 preggo's in the office), I decided it would be better of me to bring some stuff home for today.  Amazing how much more efficient you get when people aren't swingin by the office every 5 minutes to tell you the newest joke they just heard, or asking your opinion on something.

      But, I just got back from picking up lunch, and that made the second time in about 14 hours that I've come close to fighting someone over something stupid (note: about 7 of those 14 hours were spent sleeping).  Last night leaving "the last samurai" with KE some asshole in a Rav4 (or equivalent) was hauling ASS through the parking lot, people weren't quite jumping out of the way, but it was clear he wasn't slowing down/stopping for anyone.  Well, he just so happened to have to slow down to round a corner and get by my walking ass.  Well, he cut it really close, so what did I do,  stick out my keys.  Heh.  I intentionally didn't try and get his car, but it was more of a gesture for the 15 other people he was trying to plow through.  Well, Mr. Big Bad Ass driver didn't think it was funny, so he slammed his brakes and got out of the car.  For some unknown reason my first response was to start walking towards him and say "I didn't get it asshole, get back in your car".   LOL.  I'd have to confirm with KE but this guy out-weighed me by probably 100 lbs, and about 6".  Kept walking towards him saying "look, look" pointing accusingly.  I guess this guy must've felt stupid or something b/c he got back in his car and left,  and I dont think he said one word.    So, that was story one.  Here is story two.  Lunch at the local mexican place.  There are two registers serving customers.  Ok, *every* time I've *ever* been there (approaching 100 times) one cue forms, and you simply take whichever register is first.  Common courtesy in large line venues IMO.  Well, I'm next in line, and some dude comes charging over to register two - right in front of me.  So, I inform him that there's a line, and he needs to  get in it.  He gets all confrontational with me saying, "Well I'm gonna make you choose, which line you gonna be in", and my response "I choose this one line that everyone else is in, and you're going to get behind me again".  Well, we went back and forth like that for about 20-30 seconds, and I stopped him mid-sentence and said "You know what, I'm gonna let YOU be the asshole today - go ahead dick".   Heh.  Apparently he didn't like being called a dick, and protested some.  Net net net, he ordered his food, I winked at him when he went to pick it up - the register ladies saw the whole thing go down, and as a net result, I got my food first.  The question is, what IS it with people like that?  The assholes that are in such a fucking rush that they just try and run you over, or cheat to get ahead any way possible?  I don't consider myself a particularly violent person, but when people go out of their way to act like dicks, I call them on it.  Worse more, these people are all show and no go.  The guy from the movie was MUCH bigger than me, and backed down.  I stood up to the chin on the guy at lunch today, and he had me by a good 60 lbs probably - and he didn't do shit, even after I called him names in front of a bunch of people.  Again, maybe it's just me being a dick, but the last 24 hours have been entertaining at the least.

       urlLink Saddam Hussein is caught .  So I come home from another long night of partying (ironically showing a recently-home-from-Iraq Marine a good time in downtown laguna) only to find out that, yes, we have finally caught THE goat-fucker.  Congratulations Iraq, thank you United States.  There are so many great new/blog posts out there, I'm not even gonna bother giving my $.02 on this.  All I hope is that we keep that asshole safe for his trial by the iraqi people.  I'm really looking forward to the reaction of both the angry left and the international community - if what  urlLink Hamas  has said is any indication of anything, I think the next year should be pretty interesting.  In any case, I do want to share the best photoshop I've seen to date on Saddam's capture:    And my caption:  "Hey Chirac,  urlLink ya like apples ?"  Update:  In celebration of catching Saddam, I went out and bought some  urlLink champagne  - 5th from the bottom.  I'll take some digi pics tonight, and hopefully get them up tomorrow.    I've had a shit-eating grin on my face ALL DAY.  How wonderful.  UPDATE: A pic of the  urlLink oh so tasty bottle .

      This, via an email from earlier today.  Thanks Jen!  A person is flying in a hot air balloon and realizes that they are lost. They reduce the height and spot a person on the ground below.  They lower the balloon further and shout, "Excuse me. Can you help me? I promised my friend I would meet him half an hour ago, but I don't  know where I am."  The person below says, "Yes. You are in a hot air balloon, hovering approximately 30 feet above this field. You are between 40 and 42 degrees North latitude and between 58 and 60 degrees West longitude."  "You must be an underwriter," says the balloonist.  "I am," replies the person below, "how did you know?"  "Well," says the balloonist, "everything you have told me is technically correct, but I have no idea what to make of your information, and the fact is, I am still lost."  The person below says, "You must be a loan officer". "I am," replies the balloonist, "but how did you know?" "Well," says the person below, "you don't know where you are, or where you are going. You have made a promise that you have no idea how to keep, and you expect me to solve your problem. The fact is, you are in exactly the same position as you were before we met, but now it is somehow my fault."

      The Achilles has been feelin alright for about the last week (better and better every day).  THEN I went on a site inspection today up in Torrance - no big deal, just had to *walk* about 25 units, shouldn't have been a problem.  Well, I don't know how I did it, but somehow I pissed off my achilles BAD walking to the *first* unit.  The next two hours were spent cruising up and down flights of stairs and running all over this 10 acre property - all in all must've been about 3 miles, on the messed up leg.  Oof.  Went to the PT guy tonight, got my shit checked out - the tendon was all inflamed, so he stretched it out some, some more ultrasound, some more stretching, some ice, and a SICK tape job.  I feel great again!  Woo hoo!  I've got 2 appts scheduled for next week.  In any case, now, getting to what you've all been reading for: the "front desk chick".  As I mentioned in my  urlLink previous post , I was gonna make a conscious effort to check the left hand ring-finger to see if it was cool to chat her up.  Well, lets just say I found this " urlLink true-to-scale " picture.    Bling.   DISCLAIMER :  From here on in, this post gets serious, and rather grumpy.  Thanks for the reminder (and the KICK ASS! "title pic"  urlLink Chad !)  So, honestly, why the fuck do girls always want to get married so fuckin early?  I hear the whole " urlLink biological clock " argument, but WTF.  Maybe I'm just immature, but shit, I'm 25 and though I've come a *long* way since 18 in terms of relationships, however I  still  can't see my lame ass getting married within the next 10 years.  I got too much shit to do!  Between starting my  urlLink real-estate empire , living in  urlLink NorCal  at some point, living in  urlLink NYC  at some point, living in  urlLink TX  at some point (don't ask), and spending some *serious* time in  urlLink Alaska , who the fuck is gonna wanna follow my fat ass around?  B/c God knows I don't see myself compromising any of my life aspirations for anyone at this point (and maybe that's the problem, eh?).  Though it's nice to be "unencumbered" at times, at other times it sucks some pretty fat,  urlLink hemherroid-ridden ass .  I mean, I *DO* actually have a good time going camping in  urlLink Yosemite  by myself (for example) - which absolutely horrifies some people.  Alternatively, stick me in the corner with a  urlLink book  and I can bop till I drop.  At other times, all I want is someone to share things with - whether it be feelings, experiences, joy, pain, whatever - it's the act of sharing that's important, it's the catharsis.  I guess I want someone to care and listen, but I don't want to be beholden - is that an  urlLink oxymoron ?   As much as I say I have that with my friends, I do and I don't.  Does anyone else ever wonder what your "friends" would think of you if they didn't get the "watered-down" version?  I do, and I withdraw b/c most people can barely handle "fat kid light" - so I make the compromise to have some semblance of companionship - but how real is it, who am I fooling, and WHY?!?  How shitty, huh.  That was a rhetorical question.  :b  In any case, I don't know why I went off on that tangent.  I must sound like a little bitch, but damn it all if shit doesn't build up in every one of us - I guess it just takes me longer to "let it out", as it goes.  "The little one" would probably laugh that I have to vent to the internet.  QED I guess, hah.

Brought to you by  urlLink The Onion , the favorite liberal mouth-piece of one  urlLink Fat Kid .  And for those of you who didn't know me in college, 1) thank your stars and 2) the paragraph that rang home follows:  "In a healthy capitalist economy, some people are going to be out-competed," Knoep said. "I'm sorry, but some of those fuck-ups have fucked themselves. I am not condoning an anarchic 'fuck or be fucked' ethos, but I can hardly get behind a welfare state that punishes the unfucked by fucking all equally."

      the old saying "look both ways before you cross the street".  Driving in my work parking lot this AM, this old lady just about jumps in front of my car, lucky for both of us I was paying attention and waved her on.    What bugged me was, even after she heard my brakes she only kind of glanced, still didn't even look to see what was going on.

      So, I have to admit, I went to this thing not expecting much more than a 1) stay off it, 2) ice it and 3) come back in a week so I can charge your insurance another $200.  Let's just say I was pleasantly surprised.  First off, the guy who "runs the show" is an avid cyclist (like myself), a surfer, an MTB racer and many other things that I'm also into.  So, he's cool shit.  On top of that, he's also a very nice guy.  That would have been enough to keep me satisfied, but no, he had the obligatory really really really cute girl working at the front desk.  In any case, I'm sittin there chatting about how the injury occurred (my stupid ass pushing myself too hard - as usual), and he was having me walk around, probing the achilles and other shit.  He sets me down to give me some ultrasound with some special anti-inflammatory gel.  He looks at me, see's me checkin front desk girl out, and mentions, "Hey, why don't you come back here and help out Mr. Murphy with his ultrasound".  WOOHOO!   The "cool" factor of this guy just went up 10-fold.  Hah.  She comes over, starts preppin me, and we're just chattin away.  Found out some fun stuff, but stupid me, I forgot to look for a friggin ring.  Gahd-damn.    In any case, real nice girl, real pretty and seemed pretty damn cool.  Gotta make it a point to try and get her # next time I head back there.  I'm usually shy about shit like that, but I gotta get over my stupidity at some point, right?  Net net net, I'm catching the tendonitis at a very early stage, it hasn't yet traveled up the achilles itself, which would be a *very* bad thing (entailing surgery).  Doc's got me on Vioxx, apparently some heavy anti-inflammatory prescription stuff.  Stretch twice a day, ice twice a day, go easy on the tendon, I guess I can get some easy biking in (but no hills).  I should be good to go in a couple weeks if I want to baby it.    I'll keep you schmoes posted.  Oh yeah, and keep your eyes posted tomorrow for a post on african ants.  I saw a show tonight on these things that blew.my.mind.  Heh.

      I'll admit, I'm no statistical genius here, but someone wanna re-read  urlLink this AP poll  and tell me what DOESN'T make sense.  Hint:  It's in the fourth paragraph.  ;)  Would someone please do the math there (I'm too lazy) and post up as to the percentage of liberals they "polled" vs. conservatives?  My guess is something like 90/10 in order to get those kinds of results.  Makes you wonder what is "actual" job performance satisfaction figures really look like.

       WARNING :   These pictures are rather large - full resoultion on a  urlLink 4 megapixel camera  - basically not for the " urlLink bandwidth challenged ".  Enjoy!  Just gonna post a few of my more favorite pictures.    This first pic is closer to the top of the trail I took, from "Upper Pines" Campground, past the two falls, then up John Muir to Half Dome.  This is actually coming back down, and is of a  urlLink nice wooded trail  - #1 or #2 on my list of favorite pics.  This second picture was also taken on the way down (as with all my pics) - close to one of the two falls (I forget which) was this scenic  urlLink rock wall .  Psh, whatever, I like it.  :b  Third pic is a layout of one of the falls - the  urlLink frozen water  on the side of the falls was pretty cool.  I can just imagine the first freeze of the year for this, must be totally beautiful.   The final picture I'm posting here is potentially my favorite.  Interestingly enough this was taken on my drive OUT of the park on Saturday.  I was paying more attention than I normally do and saw this  urlLink serene river  right off the side of the road, so I parked the car, jumped out, jumped a fence, and snapped this one.  Came out pretty good IMO.  All things considered, a kick ass trip.  Froze my ass off, busted up my achilles on my 18 mile (round trip) hike up to, and back from Half Dome.  The drive to and fro wasn't too bad, about 6 going up, 7 coming back.  Net net net, already thinking of planning a summer trip.  Though the cold didn't bother me so much as to not do another winter trip, 1) I'd like to bring someone with me next time, 2) I hear there's a better "party scene" in the summer and 3) I'd like to be able to go with less clothing (not 15 layers).  Until then...

      Another gem from  urlLink Something Awful .  Every once in a while I get in a mood where anything will make me laugh.  Today is not one of those days.    However,  urlLink this article  had me crying.  Excerpts below:   I'm sure in the 60's when the only form of TV entertainment was Hee-Haw, the moon landings were pretty exciting, but the only thing NASA has successfully done since then was to turn a teacher into an expensive firework  and...  Now with the recent launch of a billion dollar Battlebot on Mars that will probably get snagged on a Martian rock or smashed by a random hammer, we should really start asking ourselves, "Is it worth it?"

      Today was day #3 of the computers being down.  No file servers, no print servers, no work - for THREE DAYS.  My co-workers are the biggest bunch of slackers - I think they spent the last couple days just shooting the shit in the hallways.  Personally, I was taking the chance to re-organize and train analysts.  Management was 500% pissed off at everyone just sitting around not doing anything, and even AFTER they came by and bitched people out for not working, as soon as they left, people just went back to what they were chatting about, like nothing happened.  I swear, the work ethic here sucks.    In any case, shit loads for me to catch up on, and looks like I'm heading out to Vegas next week for work AND play, which should be fun.  More to come later.   UPDATE :  So, after two days down, we got the all the computers fixed.  Turn them back on, good to go.   Fast forward 3 hours   "Turn your computers off, the virus is back.    Some ASSHOLE opened the fucking virus A-GAIN!  I left for the day.

      September 2002, a truck makes a left hand turn in forn of me while I am riding my motorcycle. I ran into the side of the truck leading with my right elbow and it "exploded"...that's the technical term that my surgeon used anyhow, you know, smart, Doctor talk.  So the elbow was put back together again by my kick ass Osteopathic Surgeon (Dr. Covarrubias) using bone putty, two pins and some wires.   About 18 months later, time to get that hardware out of my body.   It was a quick outpatient surgery that lasted about 40 minutes.  In total, I got to the surgery center at 6:15am, into surgery at 7am, woke up from general anesth. at 7:40, in and out of sleep until about 8:45, up and dressed and out the door by 9am. After a big glass of OJ, a bagel and some coffee, off to bed for a 5 hour nap. :) IT was a fantastic, anesthetic and pain medication induced, dead to teh world drooling all over my pillow sleep.  It was fantastic.  I Should be able to function decently tomorrow.  Modern medicine trips me out, it is absolutely amazing.  Good stuff.   urlLink P's arm pre surgery #2   urlLink P's arm post surgery #2   urlLink Shit removed from arm   urlLink More shit removed from arm

      Trace route:   urlLink Instapundit  >  urlLink Black Five  >  urlLink Dan Drezner   Looks like the press has "leaked" a potential "US Invasion" of Pakistan come spring, in order to catch/kill Bin Laden.  Actually, less an "invasion", and more of a "presence", but moving on...  These bloggers talk about a variety of items, the main theme being "the Sun Times shouldn't have reported this, they're endangering US soldiers lives".  If it's true (that we're sending troops to Pakistan, then, yeah, I agree).  OTOH maybe this throws me in the "conspiracy theory" camp, but maybe, just maybe, the gov't WANTS/REQUESTED that the Sun Times file this report - especially given the particularly canned response from the author of the article - as seen in  urlLink Black Five's  write up.  Let's look at the situation: A US presence in Pakistan would be suicide for Musharraf.   Check There have been attempts on Musharraf's life lately (two that I know of).   Check These attacks (if not staged to garner more US support) scare the US.  Check Musharraf has previously said that the US will not ever put troops on Paki soil.   Check Going back on his word would discredit him among his military ranks.  Check The military is the only "power" Musharraf has.  Check We have a Presidential election coming up.   Check  OK, all those points argue *against* the placing any kind of projectible force on the ground in Pakistan  IMVHO .  However, with that General (too lazy to re-look up his name) making calls like "We'll have OBL before year end", and the assassination attempts as cover, maybe we already know where bin laden and his top lieutenants are.  We know we can't go in and full-on  get him  b/c of the tribal presences in that region, so who's to say we don't just send some Spec Ops guys in to scare a few AQ feebs who'll report back to "the boss", get OBL thinkin the cavalry is right over the horizon and flush him out where we hit him with a MOAB or something.    Heh.  Sounds like that would be a classic play, and much more in sync with where military strategy (what I can make of it) is headed -  heavier reliance on psy- and spec-ops .  Guys like Rummy and Wolfowitz would just assume overthrow governments (or whatever) with as few troops/presence as possible (as we saw in Iraq - supply lines stretched thin, heavier reliance on SpecOp forces on the ground, etc.).  The cost (in lives, $$, morale) of moving large groups of troops around is burdensome, as we've also seen in Iraq "aftermath".    I simply cannot see our strategists making a dumb move like this.

      After waiting about 45 minutes in the "ready room", I approached the woman at the front desk to tell her that next time I call, and they tell me I can see the doc "right away", I'd request they keep their promise.   Oops.  Apparently they forgot about me.    Doc shows up, I explain the symptoms, tell him about the rash etc etc.  They do a throat culture, get the results back 5 minutes later - not strep.  Hmm.  Given the onset and extent of the rash, Doc feels I've got a "very aggressive throt infection" - prescription:  5 day zithromax and cortisone for the rash.  Sweet.  So, here I am today, working from home.  Very un-exciting stuff, at least I can run around in my underwear all day.  Or at least until P or L come home.   hehe.

Personally, I'd never heard of getting a rash w/ strep throat (until a couple weeks ago), so I hope I don't have SARS or some shit.  :-/   I mention "a few weeks ago" b/c my gf had this same thing (rash w/ strep), thanks babe!  lol,  KIDDING !

      So, I was all excited about being able to take pictures off my computer and send them to my phone.  Got two pictures done, then the service mysteriously stopped working.  Shit.  Have sent 2-3 emails to the guy who created the uploader, have yet to get a response.  So, I called sprint, and reported this "data error 907" - sat on hold for 20 minutes, then got some guy who sort of knew what he was talking about.  I explained to him what I was doing, only to have him tell me that Sprint has "blocked" that site, b/c of potential copyright infringement.   What the fuck?!?   Apparently if I take a picture of a copyrighted picture with my phone and start passing it around with my phone, Sprint is somehow liable for that.  Sounds like some sort of Kazaa type shit, which is also garbage.   But, thats not what I'm doing.   I'm taking pictures with  MY DAMN CAMERA  and want to upload them to  MY DAMN PHONE  .  What the flying fuck is the problem with this?!?!  As much as I can't argue with the guy (he's an IT peon answering phones) I  DO  think it's complete bullshit that if I take pictures on my own personal camera and want to put them on my cell phone, that sprint is telling me that I can't - b/c that is  EXACTLY  what's going on here.

      At least of the last 10 minutes:   There's nothing funny about Garfield. Every single comic starts out the same: Garfield sits around being fat, he eats all the food, and his ambiguously gay owner yells at him: The cat eats food. Alright, WE GET IT. Move on. Then as if to piss all over our better judgement, Davis has received the National Cartoonist Society: Best Humor award. Twice. Garfield gets awarded for humor and "Family Guy" keeps getting canceled faster than a baby at Planned Parenthood. That reminds me of how much I hate babies. Why does everyone want to save them? There are too many babies. I'm not saying we should kill them, but if you happen to be giving your baby a bath and the phone rings.. well, nobody will judge you. Besides, you might get free brownies out of it at the funeral, and brownies rule

      I'm literally crying after watching this video  urlLink of Howard Dean in a full on tirade .    And, on a more serious note:  Who's next?    I'm 99% convinced that I don't have to do any more Dean bashing, b/c, let's admit it folks, in order to win the presidency, you have to win the heart lands - Dean's  urlLink rash of blow ups , combined with his  urlLink anxiety attacks  when presented with responsibility are just going to see more and more light as time (and this "race") march along.  I'm kind of thinking Kerry is the new front runner, regardless that he won the Iowa thing.  With Clark starting to bash Kerry's military record we should see some more mud-slinging from the Kerry camp, but I think Kerry will come out ahead.  His potential waffling points are his support (and subsequent) for UN Resolution 1441, which he has since back tracked on, being so easily "duped" by our President.  My questions is, if our President can dupe him, how hard is it going to be for the Chinese or the Koreans?  Bzzt - Wrong answer Haughty French Looking Guy from Massachusetts who, by the way, also served in Vietnam.  I guess Clark could come out and lead some polls, but the guy's too much of an idiot to do much permanent damage.  Plus, he got fucking FIRED from the UN's top position after he tried to start WW3 with the Russians.  I'm sure we'll be hearing more about that in the coming weeks.  Honestly, I dont know much about the other candidates, which probably means they won't win.  Hmph.    It is interesting noticing how the media is approaching all the "press reactions" - they really DO want a horse race.

      Big thanks to Johvan for diggin through my code to figure out that I'm an idiot.  Hah!  Looks like titles for blogs in my blogroll can't be more than 8 words.  And if they are, well, your blog roll suicides itself.  Hmph.  In any case, light blogging lately for a number of reasons.  Too much shit to do at work, too much shit to do at home, and the weather's been too damn nice to spend much time inside.    I  would  be posting more pics from my kick ass camera phone - if the sprint whore-gods weren't trying to charge me an extra $5 / month for the priveledge.  I'm still gonna sign up for it, b/c it's fun, but it's pretty shitty of them to give you the service free for like 2 FUCKING DAYS then just cut it off like that.  Weak sauce.    Hope all is well with all you guys.  If any of you have "blog banners" that you'd like me to link to, email them to me.  Johvan showed me how to set one up - so "Milblogs" is my first.

      This time, hosted by  urlLink Haloscan , which seems like a cool enough site, minus the fact they have some shit-dick advertising on their front page (something about not enough "hate bush" bumper stickers in America.    In any case, they say I shouldn't have lost any comments, so I'll have to go check that out.  I'm also interested to see how the GUI is with this new program - it's a LOT less customizable than Blogspeak ever was.  Not that I used the customization, but, you know, if I had a good looking blog I might have been interested.    Heh.

My team leader just yanked me in his office, and gave me the speech: "You're the most experienced person on this team, there are a lot of things you know that I don't even know.  I'm leaving you in charge of everyone - I'm instructing them, if they have any questions, to come to you first."  Fuck yeah bitches!  Hahahah.   This, after I set my goal of getting more management experience this year, and with the hope of a seque to "team leader" within the next 6-9 months.    I'm.fucking. STOKED !

      Just back from the 2nd MTB ride this weekend.  Let's just say it's been a weekend of pretty bad luck.  Yesterday, within 1/4 mile of the parking lot (on the way back) my buddy took a digger on about a 25 mph downhill right hander.  Fortunately, he wasn't injured, no blood, no mess - however, 5 minutes later, when we got to the car, what do I see but a fucking $64 parking ticket on my windshield.  Shit.  I had the $5 in my pocket to get the sticker, and simply forgot.  Booo.  Then, today, out for a nice ride - I went up this long mother fucker hill the fastest I ever have.  You know those times when you're working so hard you want to puke?  Yeah, that was me, half way up.  Heh.  Kept going though, suffered it out and kicked some ass.  Good times.    Then, on the way down another trail, I've got these new tubeless tires, so I'm getting used to what the tread can and cannot handle, and apparently the tires couldn't handle this one, loose, off camber turn at the speed I was carrying, so they shot me wide.  Into a cactus.  Hahahahah.  My left ring finger is nice and swollen, and had about 15 inch long needles sticking out of it, my left knee caught some too, with about the same number of needles.  Heh.  Picking those things out is a bitch.  Well, hope everyone's having a great weekend.  For all you east coast bitches, it's about 75 deg out here, and sunny.  Heard wind chill back home was negative 18 the other day - LMAO.

      Got up at 0600 this morning to go for a bike ride.  Had my first bout of "second thoughts" as soon as I stepped outside and felt a 30-some odd degree day.  Damn.  Got my shit together, got psyched up and took the Epic out.  Did about a 7-8 mile loop, which consisted of a solid couple mile climb (at least it felt like it - the climb was 90% of the time of the ride - 45 minutes).  Most of you know I live in SoCal (and if you didn't, you've now seen the light) - well folks, there was ICE on the road.  Where ever there was water run off from sprinkers - ice, water in the gutters down the hill - ice.  Holy shit.  Of course, as soon as the sun came up, it went away, but not before then.  lol  Gonna try and keep this up - I desperately need to modify my sleep cycle from this "go to bed at 2, wake up (painfully) at 7" which is exhausting.  Getting to sleep at 10 last night was kind of difficult, but I think I can ease into it.  :)

      Granted, a bunch of euro-weenies from the laughable International Monetary Fund (IMF) came up with  urlLink this report , but if there is any truth to the below quote.... we're fucked:    "But the IMF researchers said that won't be enough to address the government's long-term fiscal problems - including financing the Social Security and Medicare programs over the next 75 years. In their report, they said the government faces a $47 trillion shortfall in its ability to pay for those and all other long-term obligations. Closing that gap would require 'an immediate and permanent' federal tax increase of 60% or a 50% cut in Social Security and Medicare benefits. "   File this under:  Ouch.

      For those of you who don't know me, I'm a big effing PS2 RPG dork (playstation 2 role-playing game).  My favorite being  urlLink Final Fantasy X  - which I spent about 244 logged hours playing.  You can beat the game (and I did) in about 100 - and I played an additional 144 hours of "getting extra shit".   (Which I never did complete I might add)   For instance, just look at all the shit they have over at  urlLink GameFAQs , for FFX.  Jeesus.  In any case, I went out and bought the one true sequel in the Final Fantasy series -  urlLink FFX-2  and O.M.F.G. am I in a world of trouble.  Every time you get one of these games you have to learn a whole new interface, and all the other bullshit that goes along with a new game.  Typically it takes me anywhere between 10 minutes (for most games) to 4-5 hours with the FF series games to get decent at handling the characters and figuring shit out intuitively.   This game is giving me  urlLink aneurisms  .  Not so much from the complexity to do stuff, b/c I think I've got that figured out, but there are literally ENDLESS possibilities as to how you can build your characters up.  My jaw dropped when I finally started getting a feel for how layered the game is going to be.  Keep in mind I've only got about an hour of "play time" in it.  From what I can tell so far, the game looks pretty badass.  Great graphics, interesting concept (if you played FFX1) and whatever else you could ask for.  The only downside is the 10 second lag between scene changes.  Anyone know if you can get RAM upgrades for PS2's?  Seriously.  I've come to the conclusion that, yes, I really am a dork.   Hah.

      This an excerpt from today's edition of  urlLink Nealz Nuze  regarding Bush's (what I hope will be still-born) plan regarding the potential legalization of illegal immigrants - a proposed amnesty program in essence.  Overall, a bad idea.   And speaking of votes, my friends.  Did you know that there are many areas in this country where non-citizens can vote?  It all started with local school board elections.  Apologists for the non-citizens will argue "they're sending their children to our public schools, they should have a right to vote in school board elections."  Next will be "well, they're working here and paying taxes, so they should have a right to vote in local elections."  The final move will be "hey, they're paying income taxes.  They're contributing to our economy.  They should have a right to vote in federal elections.   Slippery slope, yeah.  Slippery slope fallacy, maybe not.  Those of us in CA witnessed Gray Davis' last minute "olive branch" to minority voters with his  "drivers licenses for illegals" campaign - and it actually (interestingly) backfired on him.  The people who immigrated here LEGALLY don't want their hard-earned tax dollars going to illegal immigrants.  Why should I feel any different?  In any case, something definitely has to be done about the sheer number of illegals here.  Immigration is a great thing, but, like with everything else, in moderation.  The real point boils down to (in my mind) - if you're going to come here, take advantage of our system, at least go through the proper channels.  Sneaking over the border, then claiming that you're entitled to all sorts of bullshit is beyond the pale in my book.

      First off, let me say that  I love direct flights .  OK, done.  LAX to Beantown in just about 5.5 hours - not too shabby - minus my  urlLink DOUCHEBAG  pilot, which is worth mentioning.  So, context first, right?  1) Recent upgrade to " urlLink Code Orange " 2) Cancelled flights out of  urlLink Paris  and  urlLink England . 3) Morning news flash that cars were not allowed into LAX due to concerns regarding terrorist threats  OK, mood is set.  99% of the flight was un-eventful, until the final approach to Boston.  Pilot comes on the PA, announcing that we're in a holding pattern due to an un-market flight traveling up and down the eastern seaboard, who has been "wreaking havoc with air traffic controllers all evening".  Oh. Fuck.  Of course I start looking for the first middle-eastern asshole on the flight to see who I'm going to have to kill.  In any case, next thing you know, the pilot yells "HERE HE COMES!" and jerks the plane right, then a quick left.  I shit you not.  Must've been a 75 ft lateral move, then correction.  I looked out the window so fast I almost got fucking WHIPLASH.  Pilot back on the intercom, "Well folks, that was a close call, looks like that guy only had one running light on - a red one - right in front".   Fucking Santa Clause.  This asshole thought that was gonna be a funny joke.  *shakes head*  Now, back to the weather fat kid.  Guess I got lucky (a few weeks ago Boston had 18" of snow or some shit) b/c the weather was about 60 for the first few days I was around.  As you can see from the  urlLink pictures in this post , the weather was a little overcast, but pretty damn nice.  I spent most of my time at home just readin and shootin the shit with the 'rents.  Total book tally for week 1 was four I think:  1)  urlLink Welcome to the Monkey House .  Favorite story was, "Harrison Bergeron".  You know it's gonna be good when the story's opening paragraph starts:      "The year was 2081, and everybody was finally equal.  They weren't only equal before God and the law.  They were equal every which way.  Nobody was smarter than anybody else.  Nobody was better looking than anybody else.  Nobody was stronger or quicker than anybody else.  All this equality was due to the 211th, 212th and 213 Amendments to the Constitution, and to the unceasing vigilence of agents o fthe United States Handicapper General."  Hah!  Soooo badass....  2)  urlLink Every Second Counts .   I think Lance Armstrong is the most bad-ass athlete of our AGE, let alone the gay-ass "Sportsman of the Year" award SI heaps on him whenever A-Rod is having a bad day.  For you doubters out there, try holding his AVERAGE speed for 2,500 miles through the alps pyrenees etc, for one hour.  $5 says you can't.  3)  urlLink The Davinci Code .  Cool book my 'rents recommended.  Some interesting shit questioning the foundation for the Catholic Church, which is always entertaining.  4)  urlLink From a Buick 8 .  A recent work of Stephen King (the master), which, frankly, sucked ass.  I'm a HUGE fan of the Dark Tower series, and considering 90% of EVERYTHING King has ever written is "part" of that series, I'm a big fan of most everything he writes.  This book was not, though that wasn't the only reason it sucked.  So, in between reading all these books, the only time spent with college friends was @ a house-warming/holiday party for my good friend Doug.  Met up with a few folks I hadn't seen pretty much since Dougs wedding, about 18 months ago.  :/  Good times, and the  urlLink Harpoon Winter Warmer  was flowing (the best damn beer on the market FYI).    The next night I actually got out for an awesome dinner in  urlLink Bostons "North End"  - the "ital" part of town.  Had a pretty kick ass salmon dish at that, though the mussels were a little lacking.  Not much between then and new years in NYC.  Highlights of NYC were my buddy Rob hooking up with this (I swear to God)  urlLink Denise Richards  look alike - she wasn't *actually* a look alike, b/c that would be tacky, but this chick was HOT, and resembled her something FIERCE.   Good shit.  OK, yeah, that was a bad link, but how hot is the pic?  Heh.  Here's a  urlLink better face shot .  *sighs*  Not much to report after that besides my contracting a cold, and an uneventful flight back home.  I won't bore ya with details folks, but let's just say, I'm glad to be back in sunny/warm SoCal.  Catch you tramps around.

      (In one piece I might add.)  I'll have to admit - I didn't get a post in yesterday for a few reasons.  The first being I'd rather hang out with my gf, heh.  The second being, so much went on, I have no idea where to start.  So, for all you waiting with baited breath, expect probably a flurry of posts throughout the day.  For, it looks like work isn't going to be as busy as I expect (I just jinxed it, I know) and putting together one post would tax your fragile little brains.  UPDATE:  Holy effing shit.  I kid you not.  I stopped typing that LAST sentence b/c  someone came into my office.  Only to drop off 1/2 the shit I've been missing for the last 2 weeks.  lol.  Given the current conditions, expect periodic blogging with light  subject fare, maybe a few pics.  Heh.

Of course, it has nothing to do with the embarrasing details mentioned therein (the Chinese complicity with "rogue regimes" to provide nuclear technology), which, in turn has no connection to the Pakistani connections, or the documents found on Saddams body, which means it certainly didn't stem from our invasion of Iraq, which was clearly illegal and the worst thing in the world for the US to have done.

      Funny, only b/c I *just* had this conversation with my ultra-liberal boss, who is btw gay (so he's bent about Bush's speech), and his sentiments echo'd (to the T) the findings of this report.   urlLink FrontPage magazine.com   "After all, Americans are wrong to see terrorism as a fourth-place issue. Education or the economy or health care won't knock down buildings and kill 3,000 people. Terrorism will.  It is the result of Bush's vigilance that we are all fat and happy enough to see optional issues as more important than the national preservation that terrorism places at risk ." Emphasis mine.

      Since when does a speech by President Bush make  urlLink headline news on CNN .  Bullshit.  And it enrages me that much more that this is just one more achilles heel (on top of the debt and the economy).  Bush has gotta get his head out of his ass on these issues, or he is in for some stiff competition from people who don't even deserve to be IN the "big show", let alone competing for the job.  This does, however, present the President with an opportunity to reconcile with the American Public.  From everything I'm reading online, and people I'm talking to in person, there is HUGE back-lash against this proposed constitutional amendment against gay marriage.    Shitloads more info over at  urlLink Andrew Sullivan  - I highly suggest you go inform yourself.  This may be the final straw.

      The most powerful man in the world  urlLink just took a shit on my chest .  For those of you who aren't in the know, I'm a mortgage banker.  We basically are glorified correspondents for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  We perform all the due diligence for loans on apartment complexes, then securitize them into  urlLink commercial mortgage backed securities  (bonds).  The re-payment of principal and interest of which is "guaranteed" by Fannie or Freddie - meaning, yields on loans are driven down b/c Fannie/Freddie have the implicit guaranty of the government (AAA rated, lower borrowing costs).  Net effect being Joe Schmoe might have an ass credit rating, but he can get a great interest rate if he has a good property in decent shape in a good market etc etc.  All in all, a great deal for the borrower.  A lot has been going on the last few years w/r/t this "implicit guaranty" by the Federal Government.  Technically, Fannie and Freddie are public companies (traded over the exchanges) so they aren't really governmental organizations.  The argument against them goes, they have an "unfair advantage" b/c they can lend at lower interest rates forcing competition (GMAC etc) out of the market.  These guys (GMAC et al) have been dogging Federal regulators to disassociate themselves with Fannie/Freddie to make the competitive landscape more even.  The problem is, politically and economically, Fannie and Freddie are the TWO 800-lb gorillas.  In order for ANYTHING to happen to their GSE (Government Sponsored Entity) status, Alan Greenspan would have to say something, as no elected official (even the President) would be willing to put the kaibosh on a MULTI-TRILLION dollar industry.  Now, what's left for me to determine is whether or not I should consider this  writing on the wall.    UPDATE:  Fannie and Freddie  urlLink respond .

      I used to be on a triathlon team with this guy.   ++++++++++++++ A quick story about Spence in Afghanistan.   From Afghanistan, Story of the week:  So we are up in the mountains at about 0100 hrs looking for a bad guy that we thought was in the area. Here are ten of us, pitch black, crystal clear night, about 25 degrees. We know there are bad guys in  the area, a few shots have been fired but no big deal. We decide that we need air cover and the only thing in the area is a solo B-1 bomber. He flies around at about 20,000 feet and tells us there is nothing in the area. He then asks if we would like a low level show of force.  Stupid question. Of course we tell him yes.  The controller who is attached to the team then is heard talking to the pilot. Pilot asks if we want it subsonic or supersonic.  Very stupid question. Pilot advises he is twenty miles out and stand  by.    The controller gets us all sitting down in a line and points out the proper location.  You have to picture this. Pitch black, ten killers sitting down, dead quiet and overlooking this about 30 mile long valley.  All of a sudden, way out (below our level) you see a set of four 200' white flames coming at us. The controller says, "Ah-- guys-- you might want to plug your ears". Faster than you can think a B-1, supersonic, 1000' over our heads, blasts the sound barrier and it feels like God just hit you in the head with a hammer". He then stands it straight up with 4 white trails of flame coming out and disappears.  Cost of gas for that: Probably $50,000  Hearing damage: For certain  Bunch of ragheads thinking twice about shooting at us: Priceless

      I am a really argumentative bastard.  Maybe it has to do with personality conflicts with my new boss, or me being stressed out (or both), but (today especially) I've pretty much argued with anything he's asked me to do.  I argue about whether its' necessary, then I'll argue about the extent of work that needs to be done.  What sucks is he is like 1% more stubborn than I am, so I eventually just say "fuck it" and do whatever.  The kicker is when the response comes back and I was right in the first place.   Frustrating.  Oh yeah, it probably doesn't help that he's a "Bush hater" - in pretty much every aspect of the term (uber-liberal flamboyant gay guy from Seattle - lol)

       urlLink Yahoo! News - Baby Born With 2nd Head to Get Surgery   Holy sweet Jeebus on the crucifix.   A Dominican infant born with a second head will undergo a risky operation Friday to remove the appendage, which has a partially formed brain, ears, eyes and lips.   Ew, ew and ew.   Twins born conjoined at the head are extremely rare, accounting for one of every 2.5 million births. Parasitic twins like Rebeca are even rarer.   I wouldn't want someone operating on me who uses the  non-word; "rarer".  :/  But, I guess if I only made $200/month, I would shut my fucking mouth, instead of having a "franken-baby" with two heads - especially in some 3rd world country.  They're just as likely to burn her at the stake, as declare her some fucking God.     Rebeca is the eighth documented case in the world of craniopagus parasiticus, said Dr. Santiago Hazim, medical director at CURE International's Center for Orthopedic Specialties in Santo Domingo, where the surgery will be performed.  All the other documented infants died before birth, making it the first known surgery of its kind, Lazareff and Hazim said.    Gives new meaning to the joke, "Did your mom have any kids that lived?".  Ouch.  And the disturbing  coup-de-grace : Tests indicate some activity in her second brain.  Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.   UPDATE :  Sorry to hear the baby has died.

      Friday night:  Got kinda drunk @ home Saturday AM:   urlLink Memorial mountain bike ride for Mark Reynolds , with over 800 other riders.  For those of you not in the know, he was a local rider killed by a mountain lion about 5-6 weeks ago.  The same mountain lion (a couple days later) dragged another woman about 100 yards, by her head.  Fortunately, she lived - due to the assistance of her friend and some other riders who happened to be in the area.  Within a week, the offending mountain lion was shot and killed by a posse of Park Rangers/Sheriffs.  In any case, got to go riding (and chat a little) with  urlLink Hans Rey ,  urlLink Leigh Donovan  (who I used to have a HUUGE crush on) and  urlLink Brian Lopes .  Saw Hans clear this "un-rideable" section of trail - one of the nastiest, steepest, loosest climbs I've ever seen.  I'll see if I can get a pic next weekend.    The group I rode with had done a 90 minute ride prior to the "group memorial ride",  as those things usually chug along, and all the slow people (who think they're fast) like to try and hang with the big dogs, but then just get run over on the first hill.  Bleh.  In any case, I joined up with the fast group at the back of the pack, got bored real quick, and bolted to the front.  Had to pass about (literally) 300 people, but eventually got there.  That's where I met up with Lopes and Hans, and hacked it a bit.  Net net net, about 3.5 hours of ride time, which lined me up for a good 3 hour post-ride nap.  My ass was kicked.    Ended up just sittin around with the roomies saturday night - my achilles was worked pretty bad, I figured a bottle of wine would help.  Didn't.  On to Superbowl sunday...  After calling my buddy  urlLink Dave  and telling him  NOT  to come get me for a m/c ride early Sunday, who do I find banging on my window at 0800?  You guessed it.   urlLink Dave .  Fuck.  He's lucky I didn't shoot him, considering my head was RIGHT NEXT to the window.  lol.  That boy just might never learn.  So, I was up for the day.  Made some stylin french toast, and started to prep for the superbowl party.  Party went well - total sausage fest, but what do you expect?  My pats didn't cover the fucking 7 point spread due to that damn vinatieri, so I lost $70.  The kid I was betting with started to get pretty over-zealous, so there was a point where five of us were going to beat him senseless.  He caught wind through the grapevine that he was gonna get hurt if he didn't shut his fat mouth - so he got in line like a nice puppy.   Looks like things back home got  urlLink a little rowdy  too.

I dunno, but I'm drinking H2O and eating bread to hedge. 6) Janet Jackson's  urlLink boobs look saggy .  Uh, ew, time to stop acting like we're 21 no? 7) I love my camera phone.

       urlLink WaPo article  "'Fallujah,' he said, 'remains one of those cities in Iraq that just don't get it. It's a former Baathist stronghold. This was a city that profited immeasurably and immensely under the former regime. They have a view that somehow the harder they fight, the better chance they have of achieving some sort of restorationist movement within the country.'" So, can someone tell me why that gem is buried in the bottom 1/3 of the article?  Laaaaaaaaaaame.  Update:  More evidence  urlLink Democratic Underground  is a bunch of fuck-wits.

      I've posted on this  urlLink S&W  before - basically drooling over how evil it is.  But, today, I actually have a rather large (18") ruler in front of me, so I head back to the Smith & Wesson site just to put it in perspective.  The barrel length on this beast is 10"+, the OVERALL length of the firearm = 18".  That's longer than the keyboard I'm typing on, and is the full length of the ruler I've got in front of me.  One of the five rounds chambered in this gun, contains 2,600 lbs of muzzle "force", one round is enough to stop a CHARGING BEAR.   UPDATE :  "You know, I sometimes work at the place where they make the depleted uranium tank armor.  Maybe I'll just put the word in and they can fab you some special bullets.  I'm sure that will only break about a dozen or so laws." -P.

      This reporter from some podunk town in BFE decides to  urlLink make a political statement  by "apologizing" for the media's failure in not criticizing Bush's policies enough PRIOR to toppling Saddam.  All I've got to say to this guy is:  Shut your mealy mouth.    If you actually click that link and read it, I'd hope you'd be as disgusted as I am at the tone and the condescention evident therein.  Unfortunately, I'm at a loss for the appropriate word to describe the technique employed.  Too bad I'm so fat and stupid, right?    In any case, this jerk-off's final quote:  "there's no excusing that failure. The only thing that can be said is, Sorry."  No, asshole, that's not the only thing left to be done.  Actions speak louder than your empty words (fucking reporters, eh?).  Here's the solution:  quit you fucker .  You failed.  You've been shamed.  You admitted it.  Now quit.  Get off the pulpit and go sulk home to mommy you fucking pussy.  Oh yeah, and while you're apologizing, why don't you reimburse your employer for the last two years of "salary" you've stolen from them, you know, now that you've  ADMITTED TO FAILING THE JOB YOU WERE HIRED/PAID TO PERFORM .  Fucking asshole.  People like this are what's wrong with the world.   No accountability what-so-ever .  This dipshit is just gonna go back to doing whatever he was doing, with no accountability for his actions.  Word to the wise pal, an empty "Sorry" sometimes just won't cut it.

      Went out to  urlLink Chino Hills  with some of the  urlLink Team Basso  guys this morning.  Up at 6, small breakfast (my undoing), out the door by 7, riding by 8:30.  Rides with these guys typically go 12 miles or so - decent pace when you're actually riding, but some group members like to be more social than others - so you can rely on taking breaks every few miles or so.  What I'm tryin to say is the rides are never slug-fests.  After riding for a couple hours riding with the main pack (about 10 of us), we come to the fork in the road, easy home = left, more riding = right.  I'm feelin pretty good, crunching people on hills and I think I'm having a good day - so, right it is with 3 other guys.    At that point, its about 10:30 and heading into the hottest part of the day (hindsight = 20/20).  After dicking around being lost for about an hour or so, we find this 3.5 mile downhill run.  Sweet you say, save your energy... nope.  The rule in mountain biking goes, what you go down, you must go up.  Also, you gotta get your ass off the seat, which means all your weight is on your quads.  At the bottom of the hill we made the mistake of stopping - both my quads went out like Michael J. Fox in jenga.  I literally had to  punch  the back of my knee's to unlock the cramps.  Little did I know we probably had about 3,000 feet of elevation to climb.  LOL.  After borrowing a GU from a buddy, and stealing another's water, we set out on our way.  At this point, I've already stopped sweating (dehydrated), I'd had the chills for about an hour (dehydrated), was getting dizzy (dehydrated), and was about to  urlLink bonk  (not enough calories/sugar), all in 100 degree heat that isn't letting up (dehydrated).  My only thought, "I'm fucked".  Needless to say, I got home, and in the event you are writing this off as me being a drama queen, see below.       That's almost 4 beats per second folks.  Per  second .  If that  still  doesn't mean anything to you,  urlLink read this .     UPDATE :  The graph of my ride.

       urlLink You're making progress , but some comments should be the next blog "upgrade" you make. ;)   I was just about 16 when that album came out, and it kicks ass.  I forgot about it for probably 8 years, then recently popped it back in my CD rotation - good times, good memories.  If I remember correctly, I think "4th of July" was pretty tight, as were some others from the end of the album.    I'm tellin you, if you're into this aggro-metal (or whatever you want to call it) - check out my buddy's band,  urlLink Aleda , Killswitch Engage, In Flames, Shadows Fall or 36 Crazy Fists (new discovery today for me).  36CF's song "The heart and the shape" kicks serious ass.     urlLink Review here   urlLink  Download here

       urlLink Don Watkins  was the first blogger I ever read, and the first person ever to link me, thus, I feel a special affinity for him and his blog.  Months ago his writing started to change, and I took a bit of a step back - it seemed like he was trying to figure out where he was trying to go with his blog.  He concluded that he was going to stop writing for the sake of writing (and focus on his book) - but would be writing when something motivated him.  I'm glad to see he has continued writing, and I think this recent post (linked above) is an absolutely fantastic piece.  I'm a rather scatter-brained individual, but I know what I want, I know what I like and, for the most part, I know how to get it.  I've always felt one of my glaring weaknesses is my inability to communicate my thoughts on paper eloquently enough that I can effectively convey my message.  Don, in this post, has taken some very ingrained beliefs of mine (ours) and has presented them in a most eloquent manner.  I'll write more on this later - I wanted to get the link out there in case you were looking for something to read.

      " urlLink Mr. Terrorism "?  How  gauche .    Not that I found anything particularly interesting or revealing in this article.  The one thing that irked me about it was the French Foreign Ministers use of, "I think".  Especially when making (what should be) declarative statements like: "I think we have to coordinate our efforts on the technical level, which would allow us to better assess the realities on the ground, to fight terrorism more effectively," That qualifier (I think) strikes me as waffle-ish - he's leaving himself an out so that if someone disagree's with him, he can argue that he hasn't really said anything.  File this under:  Say what you mean, mean what you say.  Frog.

      A young and successful executive was traveling down a neighborhood street, going a bit too fast in his new Jaguar.    He was watching for kids darting out from between parked cars and slowed down when he thought he saw something.  As his car passed, no children appeared.   Instead, a brick smashed into the Jag's side door!    He slammed on the brakes and backed the Jag back to the spot where the brick had been thrown. The angry driver then jumped out of the car, grabbed the nearest kid and pushed him up against a parked car shouting,   "What was that all about and who are you? Just what the heck are you doing?  That's a new car and that brick you threw is going to cost a lot of money. Why did you do it?"   The young boy was apologetic. "Please, mister...please, I'm sorry but I didn't know what else to do," He pleaded.  "I threw the brick because no one else would stop..." With tears dripping down his face and off his chin, the youth pointed to a spot just around a parked car.   “It's my brother," he said.  "He rolled off the curb and fell out of his wheelchair and I can't lift him up." Now sobbing, the boy asked the stunned executive, "Would you please help me get him back into his wheelchair? He's hurt and he's too heavy for me."   Moved beyond words, the driver tried to swallow the rapidly swelling lump in his throat. He hurriedly lifted the handicapped boy back into the wheelchair, then took out a linen handkerchief and dabbed at the fresh scrapes and cuts.     A quick look told him everything was going to be okay.  "Thank you and may God bless you," the grateful chid told the stranger.      Too shook up for words, the man simply watched the boy push his wheelchair-bound brother down the sidewalk toward their home.   It was a long, slow walk back to the Jaguar.   The damage was very noticeable, but the driver never bothered to repair the dented side door.  He kept the dent there to remind him of this message      "Don't go through life so fast that someone has to throw a brick at you to get your attention!"      God whispers in our souls and speaks to our hearts. Sometimes when we don't have time to listen, He has to throw a brick at us.      It's our choice to listen or not.

      So,  urlLink my buddy  scored his friends  urlLink Cheyenne Turbo  for the weekend, and we're headed out to the  urlLink Darpa Grand Challenge  - the un-manned vehicle race from Barstow to Vegas.  WOOT WOOT!  I'll be sure to post some pics when I get back!   UPDATE :  Back yesterday.  The original format was set to be about 300 miles, which was then reduced to 150 miles - of which, the top-seeded competitor ( urlLink Red Team , our friends [ urlLink here's Nick ]) only finished 7 miles.  Ooof.  We heard a little bit about the course from the "nav team" - 30 degree grades, switch backs up mountains, pretty ugly stuff.  We got the low-down that what killed red team was that the nav system (broken a week ago when they  urlLink flipped the bitch  in a training run, went a little haywire and sent the hummer into a couple fence posts, plowed them over, then into a few more metal poles, plowed them over,then it found something it couldn't quite knock down, so it got pent up on it - front axle got smashed.  Once stuck, the rear wheels kept spinning till they dug themselves a nice little hole in a gravel pit.  The computer kept "driving" until it noticed the rear wheel had shredded and was on fire.  Oops.  We waited around for a few hours to see if we could get some pictures of the smashed vehicle - but they had serious trouble getting a flat bed tow truck out there given the terrain - so we never did get to see the havoc.  Below find some random pictures from the weekend - all in all a good time.      urlLink Fear and Loathing in Barstow   urlLink Some entrants in the paddock   urlLink Red Team post-crash press meeting   urlLink An "autonamous" bot   urlLink The "Cajun Bot"   urlLink Team "Cyber Rider" entrance   Oh yeah, and how could I forget (enter bandwidth whore):  urlLink Our ride for the weekend   urlLink You'rs truly figuring out HTF to work the CD player/Nav system   urlLink Expensive   urlLink Vroom fucking vroom

      [Jacked from my post on the  urlLink R6 Message Net  - you can see responses there.]  Well, on valued recommendations I went out and bought two games for my computer last night.  I thought I was getting tired of diablo2, so figured some variety would help.  I purchased "never winter nights gold" and "unreal2" - for about $50 total (combined).  Let me just say, both suck my sweaty nuts. I expected the FPS to be a little easier (b/c it's made for retarded ADD children) - but it was just boring, and very stupid. Doesn't seem much has changed since the days of "Doom" and "Duke Nukem".  Neverwinter nights is kind of a D&D game - so I expected strategy etc - it took me an hour to make my character. So, after I make my character (Boofy McBoofersen) I try to play the fucking game (you know, the reason I BOUGHT IT) - and I have to sit through fucking 45 minutes of bullshit text, and talk to 50,000 people, 50,000 times each, before I get to go kill shit. Then, what happens, I walk outside to try and kill a dog or the first thing I see - the GUI has about 10,000 options and I think a chicken killed me while I was trying to figure out wtf to do.  So, folks, save your fuckin money. I'm writing this off as a learning experience.  Needless to say, I'm pretty disappointed in these games.  I tried again, today, to play U2 - I got about 5 minutes in and said 'fuck this'.  So, if anyone wants to buy either or both of these off me, let me know.

      With all the news on TV lately about the sub zero weather and snow that the east coast and upstate NY areas are experiencing, we shouldn't forget that  Southern California has it's share of devastating weather also. I've attached a photo illustrating the excessive damage caused to a home from a west coast storm that passed through the Los Angeles area a couple of days ago. It really makes you cherish what you have, and reminds us not to take life for granted!!!   Warning:  urlLink The attached picture is quite graphic

      With all the flap going on about WMD in Iraq, I think this article found on  urlLink Slashdot  is worth mentioning.  It has to do with the CIA secretly sabotaging software the Russians  bought  (UPDATE: "stole") to run their pipelines.  Opposition to this Administrations handling of the situation in Iraq is founded on the premise that we have not yet found WMD's - fair enough, as far as Joe Average/non-CIA knows.  What today's "anti-Bush" crowd don't seem to understand is there were many many many reasons to depose of Saddam (womens rights, mass torture/murder, environmental issues to name a few) - however, b/c of the extreme ignorance of the American populous (admit it folks), the administration calculated it would pursue the avenue that would strike the *most* fear in your average American, hence our rationale became "WMD proliferation".  Does that mean they "sexed up the dossier" as has been purported, or that "Bush lied" - IMO, no, it simply means the President carefully selected his argument.  He consequently won "the debate" too.  Hindsight being 20/20 doesn't mean shit - I think we can all  agree that with Saddam being gone, the world is a better place.  How all this ties into the slashdot article, is that people who do their homework also knew there were many more reasons to "invade" Iraq.  In this instance (slashdot article) - we are only NOW (12 years later) finding out about  one  of the tactics our Government (under Reagan) used to cripple the Soviet Union.  According to "today's" anti-Bush crowd argument, the government should have fully disclosed to  ALL  American Citizens what it intended to do to Russia, have Congress approve it, then have the UN ratify the action.  Honestly folks, how effective would that have been?  Same difference in going to the UN to actually enforce something pertaining to Iraq - I mean, we've already shown the extent of corruption within the UN, and how that pork-barrell bullshit flowed through to Hussein as well.  Intentions were compromised at our (as a Nation) expense.  Ridiculous, effing ridiculous.

      Warning: Bread is Evil.    Did you know:  1) More than 98 percent of convicted criminals are bread eaters ! 2) Exactly half of all children who grow up in bread - eating households score in the bottom 50% on standardized IQ tests ! 3) In the 19th century, when virtually all bread was baked in the home, the average life expectancy was less than 55 years; infant mortality rates were unacceptably high; many women died in childbirth; and diseases such as typhoid, scarlet fever, smallpox and influenza ravaged entire nations ! 4) Statistics show that more than 75 % of violent crimes are committed within 24 hours of eating bread ! 5) Bread is made from a substance called "dough." Researchers have proven that as little as one pound of dough can choke a large animal like a horse. The average person eats more bread than that in one month ! 6) Bread is known to be extremely addictive. Subjects deprived of bread and given only water, actually begged for bread after just two days ! 7) Bread is a "gateway" food item, which usually leads to such items as butter, jam, peanut butter and even ... bacon ! 8) Bread has been proven to kill. Scientists have now uncovered alarming evidence that 100% of the people who eat bread will eventually die ! 9) Unattended newborn babies can choke on bread ! 10) Bread is baked at temperatures as high as 425 degrees Fahrenheit ! Don't laugh...that kind of heat can kill a full grown adult in less than five minutes. 11) 96 % of cancer victims eventually admit that they've eaten bread !  File this under: The beauty of statistics.  (Thanks Mango!)  If you're wondering, W.T.F. is fat kid talking about now, he's eaten one too many crullers or something,  this all in response to  email pleas (see below) from a co-worker, begging for me (and all my co-workers) to give money to the "Million Mom March" (I'm not even linking it for a number of reasons, the first being  it was conceived by a bored-ass housewife who saw coverage of Columbine on TV ) - a march protesting gun violence, the NRA, and our Second Amendment to name a few.  In any case, I'd let the first email go, b/c the woman propagandizing the march has had 2 kids killed in gang-related violence.  I don't know about you, but is it callous of me to recommend that you MOVE after the first one gets jacked?  Nah, that would be  smart .  Regardless, it happened, and I'm sad - but that doesn't give her  any  authority to disseminate BULLSHIT emails to the rest of the company trying to guilt us into giving money to a BULLSHIT cause that is trying to strip my freedoms.  So, as I mentioned, I let the first email slip - just talked to HR about it.  Then, the second, third, fourth and fifth emails came across my desk - from a couple people in that office.  W.T.F.   I'll see if I can round them up so you can get a flavor for what I'm dealing with here....  OK, fifth email first: =================================== As many of you are aware, XXX is active with the Million Mom March.  Many of us at the XXX platform would like to join together for this year's march, which is to be held on May 9 (Mother's Day), in support of XXX.  Anyone who wants to participate should register through the link listed below.  Registering only takes a couple of minutes on-line.  Please let me know if you intend to participate, since  we will be having t-shirts made for the event .  (Let me know t-shirt sizes and we will try to accommodate those requests as well...)    More information will follow about the event.   Those who cannot participate but who would like to make a donation are welcome to do so by sending a check payable to the Million Mom March  to me in the XXX office.  We will likely have other opportunities to contribute in support of XXX and her family in the future.  (emphasis mine)  Fourth email: =================================== In lieu of flowers, two suggestions for XXX would be to send in a donation to the Million Mom March, or to the XXX Memorial Gift Fund.  (See below.)   There also is discussion of doing something for XXX's grandaughter, with details to be worked out later.  This year's Million Mom March is to be held in Washington on May 9.  XXX, XXX, and I will be organizing a team of XXX people to march in support of XXX.   We will be providing more information next week on this event, and hope that many of those here locally will be able to participate.

Or that you're lazy ;)    To get rid of all that bullshit, just make up a BS email account, and use some recognizable name, then tell the comment program to "remember you" and you'll never have to fill that shit in again.

      B/c I don't feel like re-typing this - here's a brief synopsis of my weekend (via an IM convo):  animus949: check this animus949: race at 4,500 feet (kinda high) animus949: temperatures in the mid 90's animus949: noon start (my shift) animus949: working on a cold already animus949: not enough warm (heart rate sky rockets) animus949: i won the prologue (HR even higher) animus949: couldn't get HR *below* 190 for the first 5 miles animus949: dehydration sets in in lap one (figured this out later) animus949: by lap 2, calves had cramped, quads were gone, shins were gone and hams were on their way animus949: so i crased into a tree at 25 animus949: got impaled on a stick animus949: didn't know it was there till 6 miles later when i finished the lap animus949: that's no big deal, the big deal was my dehydration - within 2 hours of finishing i was dizzy, light headed, cold sweats and puking all over animus949: had to bum a ride to the hospital 25 miles away animus949: waited 6 FUCKING HOURS TO SEE A DOCTOR animus949: all while throwing up inthe lobby animus949: they pumped 5 LITERS of fluid into me before i even started to THINK about pissing animus949: usually it only takes people .5 liters animus949: i needed 10 times that animus949: spent the night there, went back to the race at 0800  Despite all this, out of 500 racers I still had a top 10 best lap time overall.  This is me in the hospital, at about 4:30 Sunday morning...     And some action shots from the race:  Me, hangin out about 10 minutes prior to the race starting.  No I'm not on a bike b/c this race started with a run of about 600 meters, followed by a "parade lap" around the camp ground, then followed by a lap of the race course.    Me in the transition from run > bike during the prologue.    Me winning the prologue (not that it counted for anything).    End of lap two, later in the day - this was the stick that I go impaled on during my little "get off into the tree" episode.  The stick went in my shorts, out my shorts and back into  my shorts.  No fvcking IDEA how that happened.  Also funny to notice you can see I'm getting notably more pale as the day went on - and check those bags under my eyes - lol.

      Heading out to Idylwild, CA to compete in the  urlLink 24 Hours of Adrenaline .  Before you ask, no I'm not doing it solo - this will be a 5 man effort.  Each person completes one 11-mile loop, then gets to rest while the other guys ride.  Seeing as how I'm the "young buck" of the crew, I get to go first (cluster fvck  le mans  style start - which means run a mile, parade loop around camp ground, then race a lap), and I also get to pick up the slack if, say at 0300, someone doesn't feel like riding.  Hah.  Should be a blast.  Expected total mileage for the 24 hours is between 60 and 70.  :D  I'm comin back Sunday, so don't expect posting until then at the earliest.  I'm also going to try and put together a photo-blog of the event, should definitely be bandwidth intensive.  Woo hoo.    Have a safe weekend and catch you on the flip side.

      So, I'm sitting in my office, looking out at this overheating car in the parking lot - looks like this guys radiator blew up or something - he'd just pulled into this spare  urlLink parking space .  Next thing you know the smoke starts getting  urlLink thicker  &  urlLink thicker .  Until pretty much the whole car is  urlLink engulfed .  So, as you could see in the previous picture, the  urlLink fire department  rolls up and gets some water on it.    Here's what was  urlLink left over .  I went down afterwords to try and get a picture of the motor and the interior (which were completely scorched out - NOTHING left), but I felt a twang of conscience walking over with the camera.  I'd asked permission to take the pictures you see here, but when I walked down the second time, I felt  like a complete shit bag taking pictures of this kids car all burnt to a crisp.  All I could bring myself to ask was, "What caused it" - apparently a fuel line.    Guess I can no longer say "nothing fun happens to me" - b/c this was pretty damn random.

      Looks like as an "active blogger user" I'm eligible for a  urlLink GMAIL  account!!   Something I've been tryin to get for MONTHS!   effin SWEEEET!  Thanks  urlLink Blogger  and  urlLink Google !  Alright, all you bitches need to  urlLink send me an email  (!!), I gotta get some base info for my filter to start kickin in.  I'm such.a.dork for being this excited about this. lol  UPDATE:  Holy god, the GUI is gonna take a little getting used to.  I'm *really* diggin the ability of the program to "hide" or "unhide" the email history - it allows you to see the first line of an email, and then hide all the other bullshit.   Conversation log example: I sent an email to my dad, then he responded, and I responded back again - the conversation log shows one message with a "(3)" next to it - so I can track back (in 1 place) all the messages with that subject header.  The only weird thing is that it also tracks who last responded (being "ME") - so the way I'm used to reading email it looks like a sent file, as I have to look one person to the right to see who it was addressed to  (I'm not sure that made any sense....).  UPDATE #2:  Oops.  Ok, I fucked up, it doesnt track who the last two commenters were - it tracks the originator of the email, THEN the last commenter.  Cool.  I'm going to test this by sending an email to a list and have people comment to see how google treats the responses.   Again, another thing to note is there is no "header" columns, like in Outlook (my normal email program).  You cannot sort by date, topic, file size etc.  The file size data sort is gonna be the one I'm going to miss - as I used that "sort by" every once in a while.    More to come as I play with the application more.

      Didn't intend for  urlLink my comments to this post  to be construed as a publicity stunt, but referrer logs don't lie.  I'll see if I can get a post together at some point in my busy day to discuss what I feel defines a true "hero".  FWIW I think this all comes down to the old liberal trick of bastardizing language ( urlLink case in point ) to justify means to an end.  For, unfortunately, I look around me these days, and I don't see any hero's.  Our ADD-ridden society is serverely deficient in the "conviction" department, and to this jaded 25 year old, hero's appear to be a thing of the past.  Adding insult to injury, the more we try and seek hero's in our everday lives (to make ourselves feel better that we're not completely fucked) - the more we cheapen the concept and spiral further away from the essence of "heroism".  More to come.   I guess the best quick analogy I can come up with is the William Wallace example - the character Mel Gibson played in Braveheart.  I think this is the first image that comes to peoples minds when they hear about the defiant Italian who was un-ceremoniously  urlLink shot in the neck  by human filth, the same murder Al Jazeera is touting as "too violent" for their animalistic audience.    An interesting thing was happening in the comments section of Allah's post noted above - people started calling this courageous soul a  hero .  While that was also my initial gut reaction, I changed my mind when I started thinking about it.  I empathize with the bandwagon jumpers - they want to make a martyr out of this man.  Whether your motivation is to get angry at Muslims, or feel superior to them, or simply to feel SOMETHING about what happened - we should put those things aside if we're going to label one man, above all other comers a hero.  What he did was defiant?  Yes.  Courageous?  Yes.  Noble?  Very much so.  Heart wrenching?  Fuck yes.  Heroic?  No.    I'd put forth the only argument that could be made that this man be recognized as a hero would be for his ability to view his situation with an unclouded mind, and recognize, with 100% clarity the extent of his situation and turn it into the absolute best thing possible.  However, in my opinion, that earns my deep-seated respect (and it's not an outburst I'll likely forget for the rest of my life - for this certainly is one of those things we'll tell our grandkids), but not the exalted title of Hero.    More after lunch, I need food.

       urlLink Russian Captives Freed in Baghdad   Some weird shit appears to be going down in Iraq.  It's like the locals have been kidnapping the hell out of random countries workers, they releasing them 5 minutes later.  I wonder if this is their version of "psyops" - meaning they're trying to convey the message that they can kidnap people at will, and release who they want (note they haven't released the American truck driver).  Pretty fucking stupid - however I guess it will weed out the weaker of the Coalition members - you know, see who'll cave at the slightest provocation.

      Ever have one of those days where you set your Media Player to "random" and let it run through your ENTIRE music selection (in my case, about 1,100 songs) - and for its' life it can't come up with ONE.GOOD.SONG?   Well, that is my day, and it's thoroughly pissing me off.

      Via  urlLink Instapundit .  What's interesting to me is that this guy was re-elected on an anti-American platform.  I'm honestly curious to see what's driving these "popularity" indices - has German policy changed w/r/t the goings on in Iraq?  Have the German people changed their viewpoints?    Food for thought - as it all has future relationship implications for our two countries.

       urlLink North Korea says standoff with US at "brink of nuclear war"   Fuck Kim Jong Il.  This is the man who's come out and publicly supported John Kerry's run for President, of course he's going to act belligerent at a time like this (with what's going on in Iraq) and with a Presidential election coming up.  That "Joe-Average" doesn't recognize this is bullshit.

      LMFAO -  urlLink The Hornivore ! Don't ever marry, you're The Hornivore. Roaming, sexual, subhuman.      The Hornivores (you) are some of the most screwed up and naughty beings in the Universe. And their numbers are growing, mostly due to skipped or misused contraception. You care not. There's one thing you want, one sole need.      Half manly, half bestial, you act on instinct, and animal charisma smoothes the way. It's unlikelyyou're driven by much other than your own selfish, orgasmic requirements. Your appearance and personality have evolved for the hunt. Ass beckons, you oblige.      For the record, you can happily bang all personality types, however your match percentages might be low with the kinder, more sensible people of the world, purely because they all wish to avoid you. Good luck to them.

      Well, not really, but I went out today with my boss and a buddy from Santa Monica.  Was literally 5 minutes into the ride, when I tried bunny hopping and heard this giant *SLAM*.  (Uh oh, that's not normal).  Long story short, the shock acted like a fucking pogo-stick for the rest of the entire ride, and proceeded to both top and bottom out on each bump (doesn't make sense, I know).  Net net net, I blew the damping cartridge in one of the fork legs.  Oops.  Should be (probably will be) covered under manufacturers warranty, but the funny thing is I need the bike for a 24 hour race I'm competing in which is 3 weeks away.  :/    Being that my hand was forced (no, really) - I splurged and picked up the shocks I've been drooling over for months.

      This from a girl I know's Xanga - apparently she's interviewing out @ Tufts, and is having a tough time adjusting to Boston.  She's a "la la land" lifer.  What made this especially gay was my ex's response to it, which I take personally as I grew up there and still love the place.    So, here's  urlLink the Xanga entry .  And since Xanga is fucking queer, and I refuse to give them my email address, I'll post my response here. ^ wtf  1) That's the gayest comment.  Ever.   2) medford sucks, it's the armpit of boston 3) Boston women are ugly, and the guys ARE abercrombie fags 4) if you want to have a good time, ASK.  I can set you up with "cool" people. 5) new england's only good in the fall. 6) Boston punk owns.    That is all.  Mike "Imfrombostonsofuckyou" Murphy

      I like  urlLink this review   They’re,.. well, .. I suppose you could call them a metal band, or a hard rock band. They’re definitely heavy. Which is funny, considering I found out about them through a Grammy Award-winning hip-hop ensemble’s highly trafficked Web site (do you know where your Okayplayers are?). Even funnier considering they’re highly recommended by former said Grammy-award winning hip-hop ensemble’s guitar player Ben Kenney, who now plays in Incubus, who are about as heavy as a Kleenex.

      Oh look,  urlLink Gore opens his mouth , once again.  Does what he said surprise anyone.  I only ask because as soon as I saw the headline on Drudge, my only response was "Let's see what kind of crazy moonbat response he can come up with this time".  One thing about Gore, he doesn't disappoint.    And  urlLink the GOP's response :   Washington, DC—RNC Communications Director Jim Dyke issued the following statement today in response to a speech by former Vice President Al Gore attacking President Bush.  “Al Gore served as Vice President of this country for eight years. During that time, Osama Bin Laden declared war on the United States five times and terrorists killed US citizens on at least four different occasions including the first bombing of the World Trade Center, the attacks on Khobar Towers, our embassies in East Africa, and the USS Cole.”  “Al Gore’s attacks on the President today demonstrate that he either does not understand the threat of global terror, or he has amnesia.”  Heh.

      So, this girl on myspace posts the following from Michael Moore: Monday, March 17, 2003 A Letter from Michael Moore to George W. Bush on the Eve of War  George W. Bush 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Washington, DC  Dear Governor Bush:  So today is what you call "the moment of truth," the day that "France and the rest of world have to show their cards on the table." I'm glad to hear that this day has finally arrived. Because, I gotta tell ya, having survived 440 days of your lying and conniving, I wasn't sure if I could take much more. So I'm glad to hear that today is Truth Day, 'cause I got a few truths I would like to share with you:  1. There is virtually NO ONE in America (talk radio nutters and Fox News aside) who is gung-ho to go to war. Trust me on this one. Walk out of the White House and on to any street in America and try to find five people who are PASSIONATE about wanting to kill Iraqis. YOU WON'T FIND THEM! Why? 'Cause NO Iraqis have ever come here and killed any of us! No Iraqi has even threatened to do that. You see, this is how we average Americans think: If a certain so-and-so is not perceived as a threat to our lives, then, believe it or not, we don't want to kill him! Funny how that works!  2. The majority of Americans -- the ones who never elected you -- are not fooled by your weapons of mass distraction. We know what the real issues are that affect our daily lives -- and none of them begin with I or end in Q. Here's what threatens us: two and a half million jobs lost since you took office, the stock market having become a cruel joke, no one knowing if their retirement funds are going to be there, gas now costs almost two dollars -- the list goes on and on. Bombing Iraq will not make any of this go away. Only you need to go away for things to improve.  3. As Bill Maher said last week, how bad do you have to suck to lose a popularity contest with Saddam Hussein? The whole world is against you, Mr. Bush. Count your fellow Americans among them.  4. The Pope has said this war is wrong, that it is a SIN. The Pope! But even worse, the Dixie Chicks have now come out against you! How bad does it have to get before you realize that you are an army of one on this war? Of course, this is a war you personally won't have to fight. Just like when you went AWOL while the poor were shipped to Vietnam in your place.  5. Of the 535 members of Congress, only ONE (Sen. Johnson of South Dakota) has an enlisted son or daughter in the armed forces! If you really want to stand up for America, please send your twin daughters over to Kuwait right now and let them don their chemical warfare suits. And let's see every member of Congress with a child of military age also sacrifice their kids for this war effort. What's that you say? You don't THINK so? Well, hey, guess what -- we don't think so either!  6. Finally, we love France. Yes, they have pulled some royal screw-ups. Yes, some of them can be pretty damn annoying. But have you forgotten we wouldn't even have this country known as America if it weren't for the French? That it was their help in the Revolutionary War that won it for us? That our greatest thinkers and founding fathers -- Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, etc. -- spent many years in Paris where they refined the concepts that lead to our Declaration of Independence and our Constitution? That it was France who gave us our Statue of Liberty, a Frenchman who built the Chevrolet, and a pair of French brothers who invented the movies? And now they are doing what only a good friend can do -- tell you the truth about yourself, straight, no b.s. Quit pissing on the French and thank them for getting it right for once. You know, you really should have traveled more (like once) before you took over. Your ignorance of the world has not only made you look stupid, it has painted you into a corner you can't get out of.  Well, cheer up -- there IS good news. If you do go through with this war, more than likely it will be over soon because I'm guessing there aren't a lot of Iraqis willing to lay down their lives to protect Saddam Hussein. After you "win" the war, you will enjoy a huge bump in the popularity polls as everyone loves a winner -- and who doesn't like to see a good %@!$&-whoopin' every now and then (especially when it 's some third world %@!$&!). So try your best to ride this victory all the way to next year's election. Of course, that's still a long ways away, so we'll all get to have a good hardy-har-har while we watch the economy sink even further down the toilet!  But, hey, who knows -- maybe you'll find Osama a few days before the election! See, start thinking like THAT! Keep hope alive! Kill Iraqis -- they got our oil!!  Yours,  Michael Moore To which I responded: Sorry, but Michael Moore is a  urlLink fat, smelly, douche bag  To whit she responded:  ok, so why don't you like m.m.? I think the guy tells it how it is most of the time. Did you know disney is censoring his movie? How do you think this reflects on our rights? You prolly like Bush too don't you? Just curious to know what you think And my response?  urlLink Censored ?  Sorry babe.  His "stunt" aside, Disney is not a governmental organization. They have every right to NOT pay Michael Moore for his movies. Just like you have every right not to watch it. Disney, acting in their own best interest, decided that they would not *distribute* the movie (which they've now gone back on I might add). Technically, Miramax funded the movie, Disney owns Miramax - that's the extent of the relationship. Disney doesn't have Moore tied up in some backroom, or have a gun to his head telling him what to (and what not to) say. If Miramax, or Michael Moore, for example, wanted to distribute the movie on their own dime, no one is stopping them. Moore's a multi-multi-multi millionaire. If he wanted to get it done, he could. Think Mel Gibson and The Passion of the Christ - worked good for him, right?  In any case, all I'm sayin is do your homework if you're gonna come back with a retort. Or, you could just swallow every hunk that fat fucktard spews out for your consumption without questioning a word of what he says - despite the fact that he admits he goofs on his sheeple (see link above).  BTW, what I *think* or how I *feel* has nothing to do with Mr. Moore being a big fat liar. THAT is a fact. ;) Stupid Bitch:0    Fat Kid:1

However, with  urlLink the way our political climate is shaping up   it wouldn't surprise me in the least to see more and more people getting all fired up like this guy.

      For those of you who didn't already know, I ride a motorcycle, an R6 specifically.  Some of the folks I ride with act like fools on their bikes, shit like standing on the tank backwards cruising 80+ mph down the highway.  Or, sitting on the tank with your legs over the front, and your GF driving the bike from your seat - basically not.smart.stuff.  I avoid doing shit like that for a number of reasons: 1) I'm not that coordinated, 2) I have this fear of falling off and getting run over by a car (call me a pussy if you must) and 3) it's just stupid.  However, I can let some of that stuff pass b/c those guys aren't endgangering (for the most part) other people.  Odds are if they fall off in traffic, they're not going to hurt the driver who runs them over.   urlLink This guy OTOH, should be tarred and feathered .  What an effing retard.

       urlLink All of it . So they found a sarin shell? Eh. Halliburton put it there, it was old, and besides everyone knew Saddam had WMD, and we gave him the sarin anyway, and it would be news if we found 400 shells, but if they were old undeclared shells they wouldn’t count because they weren’t a threat to us anyway – do you know that most of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi? Why aren’t we invading them? Not that we should, that would TOTALLY be about oil, anyway , did you read Doonesbury today? He had this giant hand talking in a press conference. This big giant floating hand. I think it was a reprint. I like when he has that bald dude who’s in charge of some Iraqi city. Bald dude is like, wasted.   The story of the prison abuse might have had a different impact if the media had chosen a different tack. The only news that hits the front page is bad news; the innumerable small fragments of good news don’t make A1 because papers have their standards, you see. We are expected to repair Iraq’s dilapidated electrical grid, so replacing an old generator and turning on the power to a neighborhood that’s had brown-outs for ten years is not news. Two Marines dead in an ambush is news because A) death leads, and B) that “mission accomplished” aircraft carrier photo op needs to be debunked, however subtly, as often as possible. The media has come to believe that reporting more good than bad somehow makes them suspect; it goes contrary to The Mission, which is to find out what’s wrong.

      First off, let me just say that I love Jeff Jarvis, however his continued  urlLink shameless promotion of Iraqi bloggers  kind of weirds me out.  Dunno why, it just seems like every time I check his blog, he's got some new post trying to get Iraqi bloggers picked up by mainstream news sources.  I thought what they were doing was present themselves as an ALTERNATIVE to mainstream media.    Having them on the payrolls of these organizations (IMO) would probably compromise their objectivity.  Even if it's not explicit, the editors desk will provide for an implicit censor - not what these guys need, or us even for that matter.

A few options cross my mind: 1) Allah finally found a job 2) Allah just isn't finding  urlLink today's news  satire-worthy anymore. 3) There's some political significance ( urlLink # of days , etc) to the 5/11 that I don't get.  Either way, sucks if the site just goes down with no "final post" or something.

       urlLink www.AndrewSullivan.com - "Faked"  op-ed. So far in the Iraq war battle, two major anti-war media outlets, the BBC and the Mirror, have been rocked. Tony Blair is still in office.  I've said it before, and it's worth repeating.  It really is stupid to be passing such quick judgement on our progress in Iraq, people don't just say "Hindsight is 20/20" for the fuck of it.  Only in the coming 20, 30, 40 or even 50 years will we see the true ramifications of what we've done here.  My stance on the war is that, within those timelines our actions will be seen as a major positive.    Compound that with the stance of the anti-war left, with their nanosecond by nanosecond attention span (or lack thereof), and it becomes clear to see what it is that frustrates me so much with them.

       urlLink "Nope, no fire here, just keeeeeeeeeep walkin..."    urlLink This  is another one of those things that kid on the R6MN rails against.  Claims it simply doesn't exist, or if it does, it's all right-wing religious fundy propaganda.  I have no idea what he'd say about this example for a few reasons: 1)  I'm banned  and  2) he refuses to read any link I've ever posted.   3) even if he did read it, there is no way in FUCK he would ever respond, b/c there's nothing for him to say, so, the classic 3rd grade approach to debate ensues....sling an insult and hope to change the topic.  LOL 4) he might not even know about it, given the  urlLink lack of coverage  by "big media" as noted by Glenn Reynolds.  Like a worn paperback baby....  *sighs*  Funny thing is, today has actually been a super relaxing day.  I haven't had to read any stupid bullshit from asshatted liberals, I've done my job, the day is nearing an end.  Oh yeah, and no (true) religious fanatics have  urlLink cut the heads off of US civilians .  And, btw, am I the ONLY person in the world who finds it disgusting how his father is trying to  urlLink politicize this whole thing ?   Have some respect for the dead, even if you disagree with the motivations for your son's actions, you can at the very least respect his memory by shutting the fuck up.    I'll tell you what though, it sure is nice to be getting IM's and emails from my friends on the R6 board, talking about how bullshit my banning is.  I guess one of them is going to make a banner, "Save Triguy" or something like that, which a few of them are going to use as their "sig banners" in protest.  Heh.  Nice to know the whole world isn't going to shit, thanks guys.

So,  I've been banned .  Found out this morning when I went to check a private message  urlLink one of the mod's  had sent me, when "voila" no more board access.  Logged out, and checked a few of my posts, only to see "banned" written under my name.  I feel like a fuckin leper.  LOL. Ob la dee ob la da life goes on bro, naaa na na na life goes on. So, the least I can do is solicit ideas for new "titles" for me when/if I go back to the board.  I was thinkin something along the lines of: "Scapegoat" "Pariah" "BANNED" "Oppressed" "Lazarus" "On thin ice" or "DMZ" or something.     Leave your suggestions in the comments box!

      This one about his  urlLink internal conflict , and his wife's impression of his reaction to the Abu Grahib prison scandal.  And the money quote: "I've been reading a book about the Civil War and Ulysses Grant — and I'm not going to compare the two, don't get me wrong, and don't anybody rush off and say he doesn't get the difference between Iraq and the Civil War," Mr. Rumsfeld said. "The fact of the matter is, the casualties were high, the same kinds of concerns that we're expressing here were expressed then." The people then, Mr. Rumsfeld said, "were despairing, they were hopeful, they were concerned, they were combative."   But in the end, he concluded, "the carnage was horrendous, and it was worth it ." It will be a sad sad sad day in American history the day Donald Rumsfeld is forced from office due to partisan bickering.

      And maybe this can help explain how furious I get when a liberal opens their stupid ass retarded mouth, some choice quotes from the R6MessageNet - a motorcycle messageboard I frequent:  This first one's about the Marine who recently received the Navy Cross, that nobody heard about on the news: I read the citation above in the story and just wondered if the guy runs for president as a democrat in 30 years or so, will the citation be questioned along with whether he really did kill as many enemy as suggested, etc.   Quote:  That's definitely a nice change... But alas, the American News Media only tells us what they want us to hear, and apparently True Acts of Heroism aren't "News" to those who provide it.   Well maybe the next time one of you retards wants to blame the "liberal media" () you should realize that bad news sells newspapers, not sappy crap.  Who wants to see 30 stories of schools being rebuilt*, and see nothing but pictures of smiling Iraqi kids? Fundies and people so slanted that thats what theyre seeing anyway, thats who.  Its called human nature, folks.   And FYI, spin goes both ways.  * - rebuilt, not built. Think of the difference.   Again, just some bullshit from two hippies in CO, both are disgruntled tech employees who're feeling rather inadequate I'd guess.  If you feel like checking out the source doc's for these posts, they're as follows:  urlLink Post 1 .  urlLink Post 2 .  Oh yeah, and if you were curious, this guy (quote #2), should have been aborted.  That's how highly I think of him.  lol  EDIT: OK, maybe not aborted, that's not really fair.  LOL

      $5 says  urlLink this guy  is probably one of the nicest guy's you could ever meet in person,  but holy sweet jesus, can you imagine the carnage ?    Brings new meaning to that old Marine joke:  Have you heard the joke about the Marine who was in Iraq? He was below a sand dune, a very high sand dune. And he yelled over that sand dune, "One Marine is worth 10 Iraqi soldiers." The commander on the other side of the hill said, "I need 10 volunteers." Ten volunteers, they went over the dune. Yelling and screaming and smoke and gun fire and then silence.  The voice came again, "One Marine is worth 50 Iraqi soldiers." The commander sent 50 soldiers. Went over the dune and the same thing, yelling, screaming, smoke, fire, gunshots and then silence.  The voice came again. "Ha. One Marine is worth 100 Iraqi soldiers." Again the commander asked for 100 soldiers. A hundred soldiers went over the dune. Yelling screaming, firing, gunshots. Then silence.   Then the voice came again. "One Marine is worth 1,000 Iraqi soldiers." The commander asked for 1,000 soldiers. They went over the dune. Yelling, screaming, gunfire, shots. But this time, one Iraqi soldier, his arm badly wounded, holding it against his side, his leg badly limping, came up over the dune. And he said to his commander, "Don't send any more soldiers. He lied. There's two of them."    Makes you wonder if  urlLink al Sadr  heard the joke.  Heh.  UPDATE:  I don't suppose we'll be hearing a damn thing out of  urlLink Ted Rall , you know, b/c this guy's still alive.

      Expect daily changes to this thing - the one part I'm really bummed about is how "skinny" the text portion is - however if you take a peek at the code you'll see how each "layer" has been individually sized, which means (as far as I can tell) each box needs to individually be re-sized (oof).  That is something I have neither the time, talent or desire to accomplish, so unless one of you  urlLink turkey's  feels like havin a go at it, it's not gonna change any time soon.    EDIT: I'm also having problems "deleting" comments - which the new blogger comment service supposedly allows me to do.  I'd made two comments to the previous post (as you can see), and I'd subsequently bah-leted both of them.  Curious that they're still there, eh?  In any case, I'll try and figure that out tomorrow at work, hehe.  Until then, try out the comment service if you would.   urlLink Libbo  has already given it a go and was  urlLink scared  by the log in procedure.  :/  I was led to believe it's a one-time thing as you have the option for the service to "remember you" - so, I'll have to check that out from a different IP addy to confirm though.    Well, again, feedback is appreciated, just don't tell me it sucks.  Heh.

      This via:  urlLink The Federalist   In his latest election-year stunt to undermine the Bush administration -- and our national resolve to finish the job in Iraq -- John Kerry has launched a petition calling for the resignation of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.  Kerry claims that Secretary Rumsfeld should be held personally responsible for the actions of a few soldiers in Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison who humiliated a group of the captive terrorists in their search for "actionable intelligence." This is the same John F. Kerry, by the way, who has alternately employed claims of his Vietnam wartime heroism and wartime criminality to catapult himself into the highest echelons of public life over the past three decades. Kerry's irrational call for Rumsfeld's resignation, harkening back to his days as a Vietnam War protestor, is anything but out of the ordinary for the "gentleman from Massachusetts".  Kerry claims his petition received about 250,000 signatures. Act now to refute this political folly and support Secretary Rumsfeld.  Today, PatriotPetitions.US, the nation's leading public opinion advocate for U.S. national security and sovereignty, has released its newest campaign entreating the President and Congress to support Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Please register your support for Secretary Rumsfeld.  Let your voice be heard!  Please join fellow Patriots on the front lines in defense of our liberty and national sovereignty.

      Some key excerpts from the WaPo article from earlier today: The rally lacked the star power, and certainly the numbers, of the first Million Mom March in 2000, when hundreds of thousands of women flooded the Mall on Mother's Day. Organizers this time put the crowd at close to 3,000, a figure that could not be confirmed because police no longer estimate crowd sizes.  And another gem:  Assault weapons are "made for violence," Rep. James P. Moran Jr. (D-Va.) told the crowd. "They're made for causing catastrophes. They ought to be illegal."

      So, I was watching the season finale of " urlLink All Star Survivor " last night with the roommates, and somewhere between glass of wine #4, 6 and beer # something, I decided it was a good idea to call the boss and tell him I was going to be coming in around noon today.  Apparently I left a nice rambling drunken message wishing my boss, Tony, a happy mothers day.  Tony's a guy,  urlLink flaming , but a guy.  Fortunately, he got a kick out of it, and I still have a job.  I did however, miss his birthday luncheon due to my hangover.    Oops.  And, for those of you coming in from Lagmonkey, I'll apologize now for the lack of "hot chick" pictures, I kept a relatively low profile this weekend - however I'm going to see if I can get some pics from my buddy Aaron of the club we went to Saturday night.  I spent most of the weekend helping a buddy move into a new house, which I'll also post pictures of as soon as I go and take some (heh).  All I gotta say about the house is $3.5 million with a $500,000+ renovation budget.  O.M.F.G.

      This is COMPLETELY blowing up, I see no less than 15 articles on drudge referring to this crap today.

What bugs me is the initial reaction I've gotten from people calling for Rumsfelds resignation, as he's claimed responsibility.

       Firstly, let me say that Michael Moore is a waste of oxygen who needs to have his breathing-privileges permanently fuckin' revoked for constantly churning-out 4-plus-hour pieces of self-indulgent garbage and allowing hoardes of mindless bastards with room-temperature IQs to call him "visionary" and "gifted" and all the other fuckin' mindless platitudes they reserve for only the most TALENTLESS cunts in the Director-game nowadays!   Michael Moore suffers from a sadly non-fatal disease called A.N.T.S (Absolutely No Talent Syndrome) and watching his movies is less stimulating than intravenous valium and almost as unpleasant as watching naked 70-year-old homosexuals fuck.  That having been said, it would be a good idea if his next movie was entitled "The decapitation and disembowelment of Michael Moore: Death Of A Talentless Cunt Thanks to Mango for bringin this to my attention!!

      Some  urlLink more insight  into this Ted Rall cartoon fiasco:  "Ted Rall's cartoons could have run in every paper every day since 9/11 and there will still be kids who saw Tillman's choice as a remarkable act. (Tillman's Choice: there's a phrase that sums up quite a lot, doesn't it?) People like Rall are sitting on the curb, feet in the gutter, watching the parade go past, smirking at the guy with the baton, sneering at the cheerleaders. Everyone else watching the parade thinks I wonder if there will be elephants! And when they do appear, he rolls his eyes. Elephants. How obvious.  You want to live like that? I don't want to live like that. Because when you see red all the time you miss things. My favorite panel of the cartoon had Tillman signing up and asking "Do I get to go kill Arabs." Of course Rall knows that it's not literally true, but it's true in some metaphysical sense, which makes it truer than reality itself. And it's a bitter joke, don't you know, because that's the unspoken subtext, isn't it? " Damn.  This guy's good.  What makes this especially good is he's touched on something that I see in myself: ...when you see red all the time you miss things. Life goes by too fast to miss things.

      In today's day and age with the internet permeating our lives, we are exposed to some pretty shocking shit - whether it be goatse or tubgirl, or just some crazy stuff going on around the world, we get it from all sides.  That being said, I just received two of *the* most fucked up vid links EVER.    So, consider that fair warning if you're sitting at work reading this entry.  These are just plain old jacked.  I honestly have no idea how to respond to them, I just kinda sat here and stared, first thing coming to mind was "This is SO not cool I'm looking at these at work".   urlLink Vid one .  And the even more disturbing (if that's possible)  urlLink vid two .  And, FYI, there will be no Office Space stapler jokes, thank you very much.

       urlLink Bloggers rejoice !   Hopefully this is the first (of many) articles the WSJ will not hide behind their "registration wall".  Only good things will come out of this, more attention to the WSJ as they are an excellent news source, and bloggers will be more than happy to reference them.  As it appears they're already selling blog ads, the more click-through traffic they get, the better their income producing potential is from their ads.    In any case, I'm droppin a referral link in here simply b/c it's positive reinforcement -  so, click it please let's show the WSJ some love .  :)

      A great review/op-ed discussing the  urlLink plusses and minuses and politics  behind Googles newborn Gmail service.  Those of you who read my blog know that I've had my gmail account for a couple weeks now, and love the thing.  Traffic to the account has been very limited as I'm wary about posting my account to too many bbs or blog comments sections, as those are typically the ways spammers get my 411.  That my gmail account name is my actual name, makes me even more wary.    In any case, if any of you have been presented with the opportunity for a gmail account, but have been stymied by State Senator Liz Figueroa's (admit it, you knew you were gonna see a "D" next to her name)  urlLink demonization  of the program, I really suggest you have a look-see at this article - it really lays it out for you.

      One more example of George Bush's fictional "Presidency" being a miserable failure.  Just today George Bush personally  urlLink raised interest rates one full quarter point .  His unilateral reckless approach to raising interest rates has, in effect, kicked over 10,000,000,000 people out of homes they were only able to afford by obtaining interest only adjustable rate, no cap mortgages.  These working middle-class tax-paying citizens will soon be living out on the street,  urlLink what good will the tax cuts for the rich do for them then , huh  urlLink Hitler ?  Huh!  In addition, the increased interest rates will serve as a dis-incentive for business to invest in capital items, in turn plunging the economy futher into a quagmire.    Editors note: The opposite statement (lower interest rates produce jobs, in effect) does not hold true, that is, if it serves to improve Bush's ratings.    Of course.  Oh yeah, DickChenyHalliburtonEnronTexasOilSaudiArabiaAlQuaidaNoconnection  betweenIraqandAlQuaedanotcountingtheobviousonesUNshouldtellthe USwhattodob/ctheyhavethemoralhighgroundnevermindtheUNoilforfood scamthatKofiAnnan'sownsonwasinchargeofandembezzeledmillionsof dollarsandnowthemedia'snotpayinganyattentiontoitb/citwouldtakeaway fromobviousnessofbushbeinghitlerreincarnated.  Seriously though, you've gotta wonder if John Kerry throws Dean-esque tantrums when he reads  urlLink news like this .  I can just picture him yelling  FUCK!!!  as loud as he can, then start bawling un-controllably.    It's shit like this (economic news) that makes me happy again.  There is simply  no fucking possible way  the media can spin a net gain of  ONE FUCKING MILLION JOBS IN THREE FUCKING MONTHS .  You just  can't  do it.  Then again, you can ignore it...  let's see what the media's response is....  ....  .... just checked CNN, nothing.  Top headline?  "Cassini Races towards Saturn orbit" and another headline by Howard Stern (in Michael Moore fashion) who's quoted saying " urlLink I criticize Bush, then I'm fired ".  Hah.  I wonder if that recently employed bloc of about ONE MILLION PEOPLE are gonna vote for Bush, given it's HIS FUCKING ECONOMIC POLICIES that got them jobs.    I doubt it.

       urlLink Coward .  I can't empathize, but I can sympathize with this man (I use this term loosely).  For this "man's" reaction to his son's death has brought dishonor to the memory of his son, and what his son went to Iraq for.  For this man to so vehemently attack the administration for his sons death is projection pure and simple, and he lends credibility (and tacit support) to the his sons true killers (Zaraquai).  I honestly have no other words to describe his lack of composure.   UPDATE :  Somebody show Mr. Berg  urlLink this fucking video .

      In searching for a definition of "Pax Americana" I came across  urlLink this entry  over at disinfopedia.  The line that cracked me up strikes straight at the heart of the pacifists/peace-niks/nay-sayers etc: "Kagan is more blunt: 'People worry a lot about how the Arab street is going to react,' he notes. 'Well, I see that the Arab street has gotten very, very quiet since we started blowing things up.'" Heh.

       urlLink Ace of Spades HQ: CBS/NYTimes Poll: Bush's Approval Rating Now at Negative Sixty-Six Bazillion   I wonder if mainstream media is setting up a situation (potentially inadvertently) whereby everyone in the US is under the impression it's gonna be a close race, then when Kerry loses (as he will) one half of America will get pissed off b/c it goes against everything they've been seeing on the TV/reading in the newspaper.  Hmmm.   OK, yeah, I should take off my tinfoil hat - I'm startin to sound like Michael Moore.  No, I don't honestly believe they're (the media) going out of their way to stage something like that, I do believe it's a potential outcome.  God help us all if we have another close Presidential race where the Supreme Court has to come in and be the deciding factor.   urlLink Jeff Jarvis  follows up and labels it "extremism".  Again, with the fad (see my comments over at the  urlLink Young Curmodgeon ).  Ever see "extreme toothpaste" or "extreme deoderant"?  Well, now we've got "extreme politics".

      I'd posted this "bulletin" (below) in response to one whore who just kept posting "GO SEE F911" like 50 times a day.  Then, one of my friends wrote me the response (at the top), basically calling me an idiot.  Nice (but wrong).   I disagree--the movie is brilliant. Perhaps a bit too in your face with Moore's opinion--but any adult with half a brain can take the facts from the speculation--we do this every day when we watch the news.  Either way--your bulletin entry is silly--and I am telling everyone I know regardless of their party affiliation to go see the film. Until you do--you know nothing about it, or the brilliance of the documentary itself. I don't care if it doesn't change your mind about the President--but you can't make an educated decision either way until you have seen the film.  ----------------- Bulletin Message ----------------- From: Fat Kid Date: Jun 28, 2004 05:25 PM  via - Ed Koch (read bio here) speaks out against MM's newest mockumentary over at World Tribune.com.  Money quote:      The movie's diatribes, sometimes amusing and sometimes manifestly unfair, will not change any views. They will simply cheapen the national debate and reinforce the opinions on both sides.  The question it leaves, is, where do we go from here?  Like MM himself says, "Do something", maybe it's time for us to simply rise above the shit-flinging and actually initiate civil dialogue beyond the scope of the "Bush = Hitler", "But, but, but....Halliburton!!" and "No blood for oil" screeds...  Food for thought.

      Realizing that I just spent way to much time putting together a list of links, de-bunking MM's political fiction movie released this weekend, to not share it with you.  So, this is basically a link dump of some of the articles I've read about the movie.  As always, I've attempted to remove the personal (fat/stupid/lazy/smelly/slovenly) attacks against Moore, b/c they don't really serve my purpose, but know they constituted about half of what I read.  LOL   Caveat Emptor :  The coup de grace:  urlLink Slate   Excellent read:  urlLink Jarvis   Various support documentation:  urlLink Sun Times   urlLink NY Times   urlLink Jarvis   urlLink IMAO   urlLink Jewish World Review   urlLink NY Times   urlLink LGF   urlLink Allah   urlLink NY Times   urlLink Moore Lies   urlLink Jobless Lawyer   urlLink Troester   urlLink Sisu   urlLink Kottke   urlLink Samizdata   urlLink Reason   urlLink Sully    "Fahrenheit Tedium" post  urlLink Roger Simon   And finally, the infamous  urlLink Moore Watch  (which appear to be down).

      Yes,  urlLink Libbo , I know I haven't gotten my shit together to get my t-shirt model thing going (you goat), but thanks for rubbing it in.  However, when I do,  urlLink Frank J.  over at  urlLink IMAO.us  is going down, or at the very least,  urlLink his t-shirt babe  is.  Either way, it should end up in gratuitous traffic for me.   Muahahahah .  :P    Sidenote: Why do I feel like a bastard for having a "model-off" with Frank?    Let's give a run down of the problems I've been having so far:  1) No time 2) No time 3) No shirt(s) 4) No time 4.5) See sidenote above um 5) No time? Did I mention that yet?   In all honesty, I've been pretty stressed out/slammed at work, and just about the only thing I feel like doing when I come home it sitting down, having a beer and not thinking about my day.  Having to hassle with extra-curricular items (beyond going to the gym for stress relief) has more or less been beyond me these last few weeks.  I'm sure my roommate can post up to that effect.  :(  I do honestly have two models - well, they've both expressed interest, and they're both paid models, so I guess they count as "models", right?  J and T, mind if I link some pics of you guys up there so Libbo can see I'm not a straight-up liar, and that I do actually know hot girls?  Post up in the comments or drop me an IM if it's cool.    So, in any case, I need to place an order (tonight/tomorrow) for  urlLink one of my own damn t-shirts , or a few of them as the case may be and get ahold of these girls for hopefully this weekend.  I still have no idea how I'm gonna get someone to model  urlLink the thong .  Maybe you tramps will get lucky, I'll have about 18 too many beers, and a camera will pop up... Hmmmmm.... the fat kid in a thong, shudder to think.  In the meantime, I'll show you the  urlLink most recent addition to my t-shirt collection .  ...  and my gun.   urlLink

To put it in some perspective, I'll refer you to a Toby Keith song, "The Critic": Tell it like it is  He gets up real early on his mornin' drive Down to the office for his 9 to 5 He drives a 94' two tone economy car Loves to tell the local bands down at the bar That he's the critic, yeah I can hook you up I know everybody in the business  He flunked junior high band he couldn't march in time He tried to write a song once, but he couldn't make it rhyme He learned 2 or 3 chords on a pawn shop guitar He just never quite had what it took to be a star So he's a critic I work for the gazette man I got a real job  He did a 5 star column on a band you never heard He did a bluegrass review without an unkind word  He thought it was time to ask his boss for a raise His boss said I can't even tell if anybody's even readin' your page yeah   So he thought and he thought a little more  He caught a young hot star headed into town Then he hid behind his typewriter and gunned the boy down Here come the letters, the emails, the he faxes They raised him to 20 thousand dollars after taxes  He's a happy critic yeah He's rollin' in the dough  Man I could do this forever This is easy They're all readin' my column Please don't tell my mama  That I write the music column for the gazette She still thinks, that I play piano down at the cathouse Emphasis mine.

       urlLink BuzzMachine... by Jeff Jarvis  "Horse. Barn. Gone." 'Nuff said.  *shakes head in disgust*   P and I were just talking about this last night.  His question was more "Wonder what precipitated that?" (Safire's response).  I thought that since Cheny (the second biggest dog on the block) was forced to come out and respond, that the White House was probably (and rightfully) pretty pissed off.  However, as Jeff Jarvis points out, the retraction is moot.  The damage has been done, and that headline is all most people will ever see/hear.  They won't listen to the retraction, they won't listen to the  Commissions refutation of that headline - all they read is the big bold   lies   letters on the cover of the New York Times.

What's lame is this guy is masquerading as a fan of Cheny's and that Dick would be sacrificing himself in order to let Dubya win another term.  Too bad Dick Cheny is one of Bushs' strongmen, losing him would be tantamount to cutting off both your thumbs.    Well, I've got an open letter for the author of that article, and it goes something like this:  Dear Mr. Gannon:  Shut the fuck up.  Sincerely, Fat Kid

      This from our Olympic hopeful - total stud on the team, turned professional maybe two and a half years ago, guy about my age, and our team has sponsored him through various fund raisers so he's been able to travel all around the world for various events.  We call him "The Terminator".  Total.fucking.animal. +++++++++++  first, i'd like to send out a hearty thanks to all who have taken an interest and supported me this year in my build up to olympic trials.  it was an honor to race at an event of such magnitude and i'm thrilled i was able to represent team psycho this weekend.   in the two weeks leading up to the race, and in the race itself, things went either very well, or very badly.  i capped an intense training build up the week prior to the race with a PR at the Harpoon 5 miler (good), only to suffer a recurrance the next day of the lung inflammation i've been dealing with (bad).  i felt that a week of recovery would be enough to overcome this setback but found that on race morning i was still having lung troubles.   it was difficult to dwell on the negative though b/c i had made it despite all of the setbacks i've been dealt this year.  only 15 men started, and of those there were 10 americans, 4 kiwis, and 1 brazilian.  each of us were individually introduced and called out onto the pontoon through a narrow gateway.  the race coverage was intense, with a helicopter above us for the entire race, and underwater divers fliming us during the swim.   a minute of so into the swim my lungs started to tighten up.  i couldn't find my top end, had to settle for a choppy tempo, and i exited the water almost two minutes down on the rest of the field.  (results are at triathlon.org)  the first two laps of the bike were also a struggle, but i started to find a rhythm about 20 minutes in.  the crowd on the one huge climb of the day (a 3 min. climb were i used my 28 rear cog each time up) was in my face the whole time, and i couldn't help but think that this was the closest thing to riding up a col in the tour de france that i would ever experience.   on lap five i finally closed the gap to the chase group up the road.  this is where my race suddenly went from very bad to very good.  riding solo is not a good use of energy in a draft legal race so i made good use of the draft for the final lap and came into transition slightly recovered.  i ran as hard as i could knowing that i had crawled my way back into the race, and i finished 8th overall, 5th american.   i don't generally spend too much time digesting my races philosophically.  but this race has so far resonated with me like no other.  i've had, by most accounts, a disasterous early 2004 season.  i missed two early season races, olympic trials in honolulu, and countless training sessions dealing with health issues.  i mananged to requalify for trials, and i finally put together two weeks of consistent training, only to suffer yet another setback the week leading up to the race in bellingham.  and in ITU races when you're almost two minutes back exiting the water, your race almost always over.   but i did not give up earlier this year, and i did not give up on sunday.  i'd like to take the credit for doing all the work on race day, but the truth is that racing for a team that has so graciously supported me these past two years really does put wind in your sails when it seems all is lost. and when you represent a group of people dedicated to getting the most out of triathlon, quitting is just not option.  the reservoir of psycho karma has grown larger each year, and i'd like to think that i tapped into that source on a day when the tank was empty.

       urlLink Ratings row over Moore Iraq film   Anyone have statistics about how much *less* money R-rated films make?  I don't remember them off the top of my head, but I know it's significant.  An R-rating severely restricts your audience, and of course Moore is pushing to get a PG-13 ranking, so he can shock the shit out of his viewers.  Also, don't you just love how he mentions recruiting in the same sentence as 15 and 16-year olds - brilliant propaganda.  *shakes head*

      In an effort to de-throne  urlLink Frank , the King Of All Things  urlLink French ,  urlLink monkey-smelling  and not- urlLink manly , Fat Kid hereby announces his first ever t-shirt contest.   urlLink Frank  came up with the absoulutely ludicrous idea that he might be able to sell more shirts by having icky girls  urlLink take pictures of themselves wearing them , then have various dirty old men from the blogosphere vote on them for a spokesmodel position.   Where's  urlLink NOW , when you need 'em I say?   Very original, and it appears to be working (damnit).  I (with the help of  urlLink Libbo  kicking me in the toofises) came up with the also very original, and very brilliant idea of beating  urlLink Frank  at his own game.  So, again, with  urlLink Libbo  doing all the heavy lifting (I'm fat, remember), he designed the  urlLink first ever "Fat Kid" t-shirt !!!       urlLink  BUY IT HERE!     Now that I have t-shirts available,  I AM IN SEARCH OF MODELS .  That's right ladies, if you think you have what it takes to represent the Fatness,  urlLink get in touch .  In an ironic twist not lost on me, no fatties allowed - I'm lookin to sell shirts here people.  C'mon.  I've already got  one   two  volunteer(s), just need like 50 more for this thing to work.  Also, if you're reading this, do me a favor and click every link that says " urlLink Frank " - I want to make sure he see's me comin.  Wouldn't be fair to trample him from behind and all...   PS:    urlLink Libbo sounds off , spreading the news that  urlLink Frank J.  will soon be de-throned.   Fat Kid Akbar  .   PPS 2:  Tryin to find these two...      PPS 3:  Got  a   two  model(s) fuckfaces.  Anty up...

       urlLink Reagan Akhbar !   What you don’t know when you’re 22 could fill a book. If you write that book when you’re 44, you haven’t learned a thing.   My thoughts on James Lileks you ask? Nobody does it better.  If his "Bleat" is not a daily "must read" for you, your life is that much poorer without your even knowing it.  Seriously.  An observation from today's Opinion Jounal: Stanley's colleague Adam Nagourney tries to find hope for the Democrats: "Some Republicans said the images of a forceful Mr. Reagan giving dramatic speeches on television provided a less-than-welcome contrast with Mr. Bush's own appearances these days, and that it was not in Mr. Bush's interest to encourage such comparisons."   Well, maybe. Certainly Bush isn't as eloquent as Reagan was. Then again, neither is John Kerry. When Bush speaks, you often imagine Reagan might have said the same thing better. When Kerry speaks, you imagine Reagan would disagree--assuming he could even figure out what Kerry was saying.    Update:  Holy shit, I've got  urlLink tears in my eyes .

      Spent about 2 hours yesterday trying to fix the elevator in my buddy's house.  Apparently someone pulled the door frame out of the wall (just an inch or so) and the elevator got stuck between floors.    My initial thoughts were that, since the elevator moves slow as fuck, someone was drunk, got tired of waiting for it, and yanked on the door that closes off the empty shaft a little too hard - thereby tripping a fuse or something.  Just got the update, someone stopped it in between floors,  urlLink got their fuck on , then couldn't "un-stop" the elevator, had to kick open the door from the inside, and boogied out of the party.  I have my sneaking suspicions. //cough geoff cough//  Geoff , you wouldn't happen to know what I'm talking about?  Would you  Geoff ?  Huh,  Geoff , about the elevator  Geoff , I mean.

I think it's worth mentioning (for you poor land-locked souls) that no, that is not a surf board - it's called a "skimmer".  Flat bottom (waxed up) and a bit of a kicker on the nose - you basically run down the beach, throw the board down in some wet sand then jump on it like a skateboard - in my case, most of the time with disastrous results.  And here's some other dude  urlLink getting sodomized  down at the  urlLink Wedge .  Note that the water is  sheeting  over the sand on the beach.  That wave might as well be crashing in the sand.  Thanks to Jesse for both the pics!

In 1983, 11 years of peace between northern Sudan, dominated by Arab Muslims, and southern Sudan, dominated by black Christians and animists, came to an end. As part of a program to implement Islamic law throughout Sudan, President Ja'far Numayri divided southern Sudan into three provinces. The citizens of the non-Muslim south rebelled.  Autonomy for the south was not universally popular in the north. Hasan al-Turabi, the leader of the National Islamic Front (NIF), an Islamic fundamentalist movement with a strong presence throughout northern Sudan's civil society, allied himself with Umar Hasan al-Bashir, a major General in the Sudanese army willing to continue the war.

       urlLink DRUDGE REPORT FLASH 2004�   Roger Ailes, chairman and CEO of Fox News, writes in the Wall Street Journal (6/2, A14). "John S. Carroll, the editor of the Los Angeles Times, recently gave a speech at the University of Oregon, in which he attacked Bill O'Reilly, Fox News Channel and me, the chairman of Fox News.  However, Mr. Carroll obviously did not feel particularly restricted by facts, truth or sources. In an effort to use guilt by association, he compared me to Sen. Joseph McCarthy without evidence, sourcing or analysis. An old, cheap trick used by weak writers and thinkers. Mr. Carroll essentially announced that the reason Fox News Channel is the No. 1 cable news network and is gaining viewers is because the American people are stupid and gullible. In addition, he deliberately confused our highly rated news analysis and opinion shows like Bill O'Reilly with our hard news coverage."  Ailes adds, "Mr. Carroll's pathetic attempt to smear Fox News Channel will only drive his paper's circulation down, as it should. Fox News Channel's audience in Los Angeles is increasing daily. The Los Angeles Times is becoming less relevant in people's lives, so Mr. Carroll is trying to flog health back to a newspaper by attacking television news. ... He owes the fine journalists at the Fox News Channel an apology for his insulting comments. However, we will never see that. He treated Fox News Channel worse in his newspaper than he treated the terrorists who recently beheaded an American. But of course, he sees Fox News as more dangerous."

      Next time some jerk tells you a  urlLink diamond lane  violation adds points to your record...  urlLink don't believe the hype .  I spent  two (wasted) hours of my life sitting in line to talk to a judge at the OC Superior Court, only to get up, try and plead guilty so as to request second level traffic school, only to have it tossed back in my face that, traffic school is not an option for this infraction.  Apparently, contrary to popular belief, thi is not a "points earning" offense - bah.  Of course, I don't feel as bad as the stoner kid who got busted with a nickel bag, and asked the judge to reduce his $50 fine, only to have the judge make fun of him.  Something about the hypocrisy involved in living in OC, being able to afford drugs and a mere $50 fine.  Heh.  Or the bitch who tried to cry about driving on the toll road without her speedpass, when the judge wasn't havin any of it, and told her (basically) that she was stupid, she got all flippant with him and stormed out of the court - that was fun.  Nor do I feel as bad as the kids who were read the riot act for doing something stupid like 50 in a school zone @ 2:30, or how about them no insurance, no license, no registration broke-dick illegals - gotta love them.  Scary thing is, they made up the largest percentage of offenders.  Net net net, if you're ever bored, and in need of a good laugh, go to traffic court and pull up a seat in the back.

The only thing Bush is going to have to deal with is his recent divorce, but I think Lance is one of those indelible characters that you simple can't bash without looking like a total shitbag.  The Dems tried it with Max Cleland, and it blew up in their faces.  Lance is no politician, which makes him that much better of a candidate to speak at the convention.

      Remember when the coups in Venezuela were "big events" as little as a year ago?  Chavez (the socialist dictator) pretty much nationalized everything in the country, from media companies to oil production etc.  Well, in the process his cronies also murdered a whole bunch of civilians, and the US has been working behind the scenes since then to help prop the democratic leanings of the people.  This  urlLink referendum,   was a source of the most consternation on the part of Chavez - and now, looks like it's going to be carried out in the VERY near future.    Neat.  Too bad it's being overshadowed by *more pressing* issues   like Michael Moore's speeches at the DNC, the hysterics surrounding that event and whatever other  urlLink conspiracy theory  the hacks over at DU can come up with at the moment.

      Yes, I know blogging's been light lately, typical work load for a "team" at work here is 3-5 deals, just found out we have 14 in process. Oof.    In any case, wanted to share this with you, stupid and goofy?  Yes.  Funny also?  Yes.    +++++++++++    GEORGE W BUSH  We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road, or not. The chicken is either against us, or for us. There is no middle ground here.    COLIN POWELL  Now to the left of the screen, you can clearly see the satellite image of the chicken crossing the road.    HANS BLIX  We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not yet been allowed to have access to the other side of the road.    JOHN KERRY  Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road, I am now against it!    RALPH NADER  The chicken's habitat on the other side of the road had been polluted by unchecked industrial greed. The chicken did not reach the unspoiled habitat on the other side of the road because it was crushed by the wheels of a gas-guzzling SUV.    PAT BUCHANAN  To steal the job of a decent, hardworking American.    RUSH LIMBAUGH  I don't know why the chicken crossed the road, but I'll bet it was getting a government grant to cross the road, and I'll bet that somebody out there is already forming a support group to help chickens with crossing-the-road syndrome. Can you believe this?!? How much more of this can real Americans take? Chickens crossing the road paid for by their tax dollars. And when I say tax dollars, I'm talking about your money, money the government took from you to build a road for chickens to cross.    MARTHA STEWART  No one called me to warn me which way that chicken was going. I had a standing order at the Farmer's Market to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level. No little bird gave me any insider information.    DR SEUSS  Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes, the chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed I've not been told.    ERNEST HEMINGWAY  To die in the rain. Alone.    MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR  I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads without having their motives called into question.    GRANDPA  In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Somebody told us the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough.    BARBARA WALTERS  Isn't that interesting? In a few moments, we will be listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the heartwarming story of how it experienced a serious case of molting, and went on to accomplish its life long dream of crossing the road.    JOHN LENNON  Imagine all the chickens in th e world crossing roads together - in peace.    ARISTOTLE  It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.

      This guy is  urlLink fucking TOAST  "Berger and his lawyer said Monday night he  knowingly removed the handwritten notes by placing them in his  jacket, pants and  socks , and also inadvertently took copies of actual classified documents in a leather portfolio." Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo fucked.  Oh, and btw, he was Clinton's National Security Advisor, and nevermind this damning quote either: However, some drafts of a sensitive after-action report on the Clinton administration's handling of Al Qaeda terror threats during the December 1999 millennium celebration are still missing, officials and lawyers said. Officials said the missing documents also identified America's terror vulnerabilities at airports to seaports. As  urlLink Maynard  says, " urlLink Go back to sleep ".

      I can't be the only one thinking  urlLink this years Olympics  are going to be a monumental disaster/flop.  Honestly.  After the last two sets of summer games, what were they, Sydney and Atlanta - which were extremely well organized, now we've got this debacle?  I mean, I was in Sydney fully 8 months before the games were scheduled to start, and we were swimming in the Olympic pool, with all the get up and go.  The transportation infrastructure was complete, they were just putting finishing touches on the venues.  These guys are dealing with blackouts, incomplete venues, inadequate security and a whole slew of other bad omens, and we've got one MONTH before the games start?    Oh man.  This is going to be the one set of Olympic Games in my memory that I can honestly say I'm glad I won't be attending.

      Great  urlLink photo-blogging  going on over at Dogtulosba (Chad's place).  Chad's an Army Engineer, and it looks like they got to drive around APC's and blow up mine fields they'd just set up.  His weekend sounds like a shitload more fun than mine.  I sat home (Thursday through now) with some nasty stomach flu.  Only now (3:30 Sunday afternoon) am I finally starting to feel better.  Way to kill a weekend, eh?  In any case, in some interesting news, I did just go to the shooting range, and fortunately for my fragile ego, I left the targets there, so don't expect me to post any pictures.  Let's just say I offically suck.  I am, however, going to make an attempt at doing something about it.  I took a gentlemans biz card, and I think I'm going to start taking some basic lessons.  I need to learn the uber-basic shit like how to hold the god damn thing for one, and how to "squeeze, not pull" the trigger (though I may have that backwards - lol).  In any case, yeah,  I can't shoot for shit.  Do need to learn though.  In other "good" news, I noted that they have the  urlLink GODFORSAKEN S&W 50 cal  for RENT.  FOR FIVE FRICKIN DOLLARS.  They don't immediately mention, however, that the ammunition for the beast costs $40 for 20 rounds.  /kickinthenuts  I'll save that for when I have friends to share the burden, or at least take pics of me laughing my balls of when I shoot it - the gun that's designed to basically kill any non-armored (metal plates) living thing on the face of this earth.  Well, maybe an exaggeration, but it is designed to kill any game animal - including bears and boars, two of the nastier animals I can think of.  I wonder what it'd do to a blue whale, not that you'd want to shoot one... but, you know...

      Cruising along I-5, about to hit my exit, when all of a sudden I see what looks like a lady shaking her fists in anger in front of me.  Nothing out of the normal says I, CA drivers suck.  Next thing I know, this woman start swerving off the road, mind you this lady *was* 15 ft in front of me, we were moving along at about 40-45 mph in traffic.  I back off, thinkin "WTF is this lady doing" - the very next thing, she goes off the road, takes out a call box, a  urlLink 50 ft light pole , continues to swerve across the merging 2 lanes, goes flying off the road, through a ditch and into some bushes!!!!   WTF   Myself and 4 other cars pull over, this lady is still on the gas.  Only reason she's not moving is b/c the wheels are off the ground.  Fortunatly her stroke was over by the time we got to her, and she was just kind of hangin out.  The front windshield held up, so she wasn't a bloody mess.  The rear of the car didn't do so well, as you can see.          Sorry for the crappy image quality, they're from my camera phone.  I didn't want to take more b/c I felt like I was gawking.  Which I hate.

      Hope all y'all had a great weekend.  Though the weekend had it's ups and downs, overall some very good shit.  Spent much of the time hangin with Geoff down at the Laguna House and his beach house.  We spent yesterday cruisin the boardwalk on the bikes, and gettin into mischief.  Geoff was so kind as to provide me with about 40 sets of beads, which by the end of the day were gone, and I'd seen about 35 pairs of lucious titties.  A beautiful thing...  In any case, I did want to share with y'all the results of my "bike fight" with Jesse yesterday.  Somewhere along the line I think we decided it would be fun to start hurling bikes at eachother.  Attempting to avoid a beach cruiser that was hurtling at my head, I somehow did  urlLink this  to my  urlLink foot .  Think it's broken much?  The Doc should be able to give the official word, but you tell me where the smart money's playin.  ;)  Excuse the dirty tape marks, I found a physical trainer last night somewhere along the line and she taped me up with some industrial stuff, and it's a little too tender this morning/afternoon to remove all the tape-shit.

      I've been sayin  urlLink this  about  urlLink The Onion  for years.  It always bugged the shit out of me the way they portray some things (politics being the main offense).  Which, is basically why I haven't read it much for the past couple years.  Basically ever since 9/11 - it just seems they've taken the whole thing as  urlLink a joke .  I mean, you can find at least one article in every single on-line issue like the one I just linked.  God forbid we even start to talk about Homeland Security or Ashcroft...  *shakes head*  Political discourse in this country is swirling down the toilet.

       urlLink I need more  FUNDING  . Giant tsunamis, super volcanoes and earthquakes could pose a greater threat than terrorism, scientists claim. Nothing like exploiting 'terrorism' to further your budgetary outlook for next year, eh "scientists".  You know who should be focusing their energy on this, as opposed to, say, pursuing nuclear weapons, India.  How many of those mofo's die each year b/c of monsoons or tidal waves - I bet high 6 digits, if not 7.  All you have to do is go read some of the geo-political strategy reports that have been coming out these last few years - the US is pretty much the best-positioned country in the world to deal with any kind of severe natural catastrophe.  All this airport screening shit is doing nothing but helping us prepare for some "big natural catastrophic event".  For those of you who *haven't* read the reports I'm talking about (I'll try and find links later) - they basically say, in the event of some dramatic global climate change (poles reversing, etc.) it's going to be countries with wealth, land and natural resources that will thrive.  The problem will be immigration, little insignificant countries like France, where 10,000 people died last summer b/c it was  HOT  are going to witness violent street protests and societal upheaval.  So long welfare state.  Nevermind countries like in sub-saharan Africa, or the middle east.  LOL.  Let's talk about "fucked"... every single shithead dirt bag is gonna come runnin for OUR borders - and why?  B/c we have our shit together, that's why.  All we have to do once they get here, is give them a free ride.  "Hey, you're new here, have some gov't programs to support you and your free-loading family for the next 20 years.  All you gotta do is VOTE DEMOCRAT in the coming election, those Republicans are heartless bastards!".  And people wonder why Americans are so selfish.  When the shit hits the fan, there's only one place people come running.   urlLink It ain't France  (btw, I consider Israel, "little America")

      So, last night went down to Carlsbad to Keri's little BBQ thing - had a great time, got really shitfaced and ended up talking politics with a few Navy dudes, and Keri's liberal best friend.  Oops.  Turns out the Navy dudes felt the same way about JFK as I do - we'd like to give him a  urlLink cleveland steamer .  Well, little miss liberal had a differing opinion - I don't remember much of the argument, but I think it ended in raised voices, me feeling like an asshole and everyone else deathly quiet.  Or something.  Heh.  In any case I did meet some totally cute chick, Julia, who had the raddest ink on her stomach I've ever seen.  Not sure that I remember what it is, but it sure was cool.  It probably helped that she was fucking hot.  So, around 2 I decide that it would be a great idea if I drove home, after having a bottle of wine and damn close to a six pack of Sierra Nevada.  It goes without saying it was a pretty hairy 45 mile drive home.  A stunt I won't soon be repeating, believe you me.  Given that it's already a late night, I got home around 2 or so, I decide to haul off and check my myspace account to see whats up.  Got a few messages from some cuties, so I log into AIM/Yahoo to see if anyone's on - b/c I'm feelin frisky.  Turns out two are on.  Woop, here comes the webcam.  Next thing I knew it's 0400, I'm starin down the barrel of a mean fucking hangover, a long day at the office, inability to form a coherent thought (look no further than this post), a case of the shits and no clothes to wear for work in a couple hours.    Fuck. Me.    Not good prospects.    In any case, go listen to Slipknot "Before I forget" - it owns you.

      Drug my roommate away from his incessant studying for about an hour this morning, to go shoot  urlLink this beast .    Well, feel free to call me a pussy, but my wrist is friggin sore from shooting  10 ROUNDS .  With a box of 20 rounds costing $40, I wasn't about to haul off and buy too much ammo - no friggin need, and I have bills to pay.  Regardless, this thing is out of control -  urlLink it makes shooting my .45 feel like plinking , however the gun is totally controllable.  I was expecting the thing to buck back and hit me in the face on recoil - no such thing.  The gun recoils almost straight back, and as you can see in the vids, the upward kick is limited to maybe 30 degrees.  Very cool.   Below are two vids of me and my roommate shooting this supreme American piece of ingenuity.   Forgive the quality/resolution of the vids, they were taken from my POS cell phone, as my cam battery is dead.  After you've DL'd them, you can always just make them bigger through quick time.      urlLink Me, acting the fool  ( rt. click > save as )  I was actually hoping P would take a vid of everyone's responses as I took my first shot.  Apparently the 10 other people at the range stopped what they were doing, looked at eachother and quizzically announced a collective "WTF was that?!?".  A couple dudes walked over, and indicated with their best "it was THAT big" pose that I was shooting something that was clearly larger than my penis...  moving on...  Here's a  urlLink close up vid of Pat  ( rt. click > save as ) putting a few holes through the target at 15 or so yards.  And yes, that's me giggling like a bitch at his first shot - this gun is comical, like something out of an old comic book.  It actually took me about 5 minutes to contain myself before firing the first round - I couldn't stop laughing at this 5 lb+ gun, with ammunition I can almost fit my pinkie finger in, which can fire a 1 oz slug at  sixteen hundred and fucking sixty five feet per fucking second  - which is approximately two times the speed of sound, which is approximately twice as fast as the rounds chambered in my HK .45.  Oof.
