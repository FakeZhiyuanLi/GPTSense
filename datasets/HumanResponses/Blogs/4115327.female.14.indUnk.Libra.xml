        Yesterday I drew this awesome pic of the character in my new manga.  I mean seriously, he’s hot.  Then I (technically) went to sleep. Well, today so far has been…annoying, I suppose.  My evil stepdad woke me up at 6:30 AM and told me to take a shower so I could help my mom with my sister and brother ‘cuz he was going to work.  So I complained a bit and took that shower.  By then he was gone, so I went to my mom and was about to tell her straight out how I felt when she told me that all she had said was “I would like some help” to L. but didn’t say to wake me up.  And by the time she knew it was too late (sounds kinda like one of those trials on TV if you ask me.  Lol).  So I didn’t get all pissy at her too much and ate the rest of the Chex cereal and went back to sleep. Then two hours later I woke up.  I played zoo with my little sister for a little bit (gag) and then got on here.  That’s all I’ve done so far.  So I’m gonna go.  See ya.

        Today I went to the grocery store with L, my stepdad.  Or rather, I got up at 10 AM and was dragged to the grocery store with a wall.  ‘Cuz I kept asking him stuff and he ignored me.  Am I really that annoying?  Well anyway, after that we went home and I carried up practically all of the groceries.  Then I made like a recluse and stayed in my room the whole day watching anime I had taped on Adult Swim.  That’s it.  Leave me alone.

        Since I can never use the computer, here’s what I did yesterday.  Well, all I remember doing is watching X-files.  And then I played .Hack//Infection.  I’m at level 32 now and Blackrose and Mistral are at level 31.  I have six Ryu books and 5 have as many items I can get in Infection.  I have a level 14 twin blade weapon and a level 18 heavy blade weapon but I can’t remember what level Mistral’s weapon is at… ^_^”       See, I’m at the end of the game, in the last dungeon (except for the extra with the super-rare twin blade weapon in it) but every time I get to the end of the dungeon I decide to use a sprite ocarina and high tail it out of there.  I’m such a wimp.  I’ve faced the last monster (can’t remember name -_-“) once and I lost.  So now I’m afraid that I’ll face it again and lose.  Basically it’s because by the time I get to the end of the dungeon I’ve gained two levels and gotten a bunch of stuff.  And I don’t want to lose it.  So I use a sprite ocarina and gate out so I can save.  *Sigh…*   Well, after that trial of my bravery, I went to my room and wrote down an idea I have for a new manga and inked some Cyco.  Then I went to bed.  But I couldn’t got to sleep (stupid frickin’ insomnia!!!!  I think too much ^^”) and then I remember that I hadn’t put in my tape to tape .Hack//Legend of the Twilight (Bracelet?) or rewound it.  So I got up and put the tape in and then I went to go ask my parents if I could get some Tylenol (lol) and rewind my tape.  They said yes to the Tylenol but no to the tape rewinding, ‘cuz apparently I was supposed to do it before I went to bed.  Who would have thought?  Anyways, so I went back to sleep (technically).  Then later when I’m actually starting to go to sleep, my mom comes in and tells me to rewind my tape (sneaky, sneaky!) so I get up to do it and it turns out that it was rewound.  ARGH.  I felt so stupid.  But then I went to sleep for real.  Go me.  Now for today.  Today I made a new poster from a Game Informer magazine that I had two of and moved some posters around so I could fit it on my door.  (In case you’re wondering, I have 92 posters on my doors and walls.  Most of them are pictures I drew and then stuck on the wall.  I also have a whole bunch of lists and cutouts stuck on the walls.  I am so dandy.  Lol.)  I also listened to Gravitation CDs and talked to my mom about my future.  And I watched some anime I taped (Inu Yasha, Lupin III, and others).  Now I’m going to go start on that manga I wrote down the idea for.  Ciao.

         Since I can’t be on the computer late at night, I’ll tell you what I did last night.       After we watched the X-files…I can’t really remember what we did…Oh yeah!  How could I forget?  After we watched the X-files, my mom had to go to the pharmacy.  I asked her if she could take me to Barnes and Nobles too, but she said no.  Then we got in the car ready to leave and she asked me if I had my wallet.  I said “No, why would I, we’re only going to the pharmacy.”  Then I thought about it for a second and I thought, “Maybe she’s going to take me after all” so I said “Should I?”  And she got the smile on her face like “I’m going to take you even though I know I shouldn’t” so I went upstairs and got my wallet (I only had 2 bucks anyway but we got some money from my account too) and we went to the pharmacy.         At the pharmacy, she went in and left me in the van with my little brother and sister.  I really wish she hadn’t done that.  ‘Cuz I was listening to my Gravitation CD and then my little brother starts crying, and I don’t know what’s wrong so I go back there and try to rock him.  But that doesn’t work, so I think about it for a minute and then I think that maybe the mirror (there’s a mirror above his car seat in the car) is scaring him or something.  So I turn that around and he shuts up.     A few minutes later my mom comes back.  She bought me a Cosmo Girl Magazine.  I don’t like “preppy” magazines that much but at least it gives me something to do, if only to make fun of all the varieties of makeup these people have to have.  You know what really annoys me?  When you read about these embarrassing situations these stars have been in and make such a big deal out of but you’ve been in the same situation and it’s not really that bad.  Yeah.     So anyway, she takes me to Barnes and Nobles and I look for a manga (of course).  But they don’t have Gravitation #6.  Now that really pisses me off, ‘cuz I know that my mom won’t take me anywhere else.  ERGH.  But, you know me (well maybe you don’t but I do), and I have to get a manga anyway, cuz I can’t walk into a bookstore without buying something unless I have no money.  But sometimes even then, I manage to buy something.  *Cough* (Being the spoiled little brat that I am, I usually make someone else give me money.  And it’s usually Mictoria’s sister.  But I swear I’ll buy her something at Nekocon.  I really do.  I think.)  Okay, now I’m getting off the subject.     Anyways, I have to get a manga, so I buy Snowdrop #2 ‘cuz I read the first one and it was really good.  But I still wish they had Gravitation #6.  I was really wondering about that, because they only had #4 and #5.  And I bought #4 and #5 a couple of days ago, so now they only have #5.  Those bastards.  -_-+   Well, we go home and eat and stuff and I get ready for bed and blah blah blah.  At around 9 ‘o clock I decide to draw some Cyco.  So I do.  And it turns out really nicely, because I was in a major drawing mood.  So I was happy.  Then I went to sleep.  Well, sorda; I had a little bit of insomnia because I was thinking too much.  And this morning my head really hurt.  It still does. Now for what I did this morning.  I took 2 Tylenols and I put my CD player in the bathroom and listened to Gravitation while I was in the shower.  And that’s about it.  Now I’m here, typing this.  I’ll be back later to tell you what else I do.  I’m going to go type the description for the Yu-Gi-Oh! cards I’m going to sell on Ebay.  Goodbye.

        I’m gonna talk on here while my mom’s on the phone.  We’re still watching the X-files.  Anyways, my little sister has this book.  You know the books for toddlers that have buttons you can press while your reading?  Well, she has one of those.  And it scares me.  Really.  It does.  When you turn it on it says “Just press a button” or something like that in this really scary distorted voice.  And she was playing with it while we were watching and it scared the crap out of me.  I was like, “I don’t want to press a button!!!!  Noooooooooo!!!!!”  Lol.  I want to go to my gramma’s soon.  (Yes, I know I spell “grandma” weird.)  I hope I can go there until my mini Taekwondo session starts.  That way I can hang out with all my friends that live down there.  (BTW, my mom is talking in this creepy baby voice to my little brother about how he just took a crap.  Sorry, but I didn’t really need to have that information.)  I have at least four really good friends that live near where my gramma lives.  Yeah.  My mom’s still on the phone.  And my little sis is peeking at me through the gate near our door.  Interesting.  Oh crap.  I don’t want to start saying that again.  *Sigh* I sure talk a lot about stuff that doesn’t matter.  I really need to break that habit.  Oh, speaking of breaking habits, the song “Breaking the Habit” by Linkin Park has to have been played on the radio at least a million times a day.  I mean, I have it on CD.  I don’t need to hear it every five seconds!!!  When are they coming out with a new CD anyway?  I just don’t see how people still are crazy about them even though they haven’t released a new CD in a really long time.  I thought people had to have a new CD come out every week to be able to stay popular!  I guess I was wrong.  *Evil laugh* Oh, we’re gonna watch the X-files again.  I’ve seen and own the first through the eighth season and I’m watching them over again.  I really want the ninth season.  My mom is asking me about desserts she should make.  Rice pudding, bread pudding, or a cake, etc.  I want brownies, but she has no chocolate.  Darn it.  I can’t even have a simple brownie.  Does fate hate me so much?  I dunno, but I think that if there is a god of boredom that I’m his favorite.  Well, I gtg watch the X-files.  Bai~

        Well, I didn’t test yesterday.  But that’s okay.  I’m gonna test in the “mini-session” from August 23rd to September 23rd.  I couldn’t test last night because Master B. had already told another girl in my class that she couldn’t test yet.  So we’re gonna test on the same day.  I sparred a lot though.  I sparred against four different people:  Once against the strongest guy in my class, twice against the Master and once against the new guy.  It looks like I didn’t know my own strength though!  I sparred really well and everyone said I was really good at it.  I can kick really high too!  Mwuahahaha.  (Heheh, I can brag, can’t I?)  I was wondering though, if some dude attacked me on the street, would I kick his ass with my Taekwondo moves or just bite and scratch or something?  Who knows?  Anyhoo, I’ve come to call the feeling I get after Taekwondo class “post-Taekwondo giddiness.”  ‘Cuz every time after I have a class I feel like I can do anything.  It rocks!  So all you drug-addicts out there, forget that crap!!  Take a Martial Arts class!!  (Well there’s my speech for mankind for the day  ^_^”)  And, wouldn’t you know it, my Gravitation DVD (I can’t seem to get off that subject) didn’t come today.  AGAIN.  Well actually, I don’t know how something “can’t come again” but whatever, I’m tired. I finished reading Gravi books 4 and 5 today.  But I don’t know why Shuichi started crying at the end of book 5, ‘cuz he got to sing with Ryuichi!!  It’s driving me insane! (Not that I’m not already, but it’s yet to be proven medically. Is that a word?)  ……… Time for some promotional talk for my manga!  Hahahaha!  *Ahem*  Oops, gotta go eat.  Brb. Okay, I’m back, but just for a little bit, I think.  I think I’m going to watch a few episodes of the X-files with my mom.  You may think that’s weird, but it’s really not.  I love the X-files.  ^_^ Well, while I’m on that subject, the guy who plays Fox Mulder (Who is he again?  Isn’t he David…something?)…Well…I think he’s kinda hot.  Actually I think it’s the character that I think is hot, not David…whatever.  Hang on; I must attend to my baby brother.  Oh, never mind, here’s my mom.  But we’re gonna watch X-files.  So my rant ends here.

        I’m sitting here at the computer with my Taekwondo uniform on, waiting for my mom to put my hair up.  I’m feeling very nervous.  I’m afraid that I won’t be able to execute a move, or I’ll mess up on my poomse, or something like that when I take my test for yellow belt in an hour.  That’s if Master B. didn’t forget (I don’t know why he would, but that’s my imagination for you) that I was going to take my test today.  ‘Cuz today is the last day of my second Taekwondo session.  And if I don’t do it today, I don’t know when I’ll work up the guts to do it again.  I’m mostly afraid that Master B. forgot about it, ‘cuz I don’t know if I’ll tell him that he forgot, ‘cuz I’m afraid to take it.  Or something.  I dunno.  Anyway, I’m just rambling.   I’ve been working on another song in Japanese.  But since I don’t really know that much Japanese, it’s kinda hard.  I wrote out the basic idea in English and looked up the translation.  But that’s all.   Lately I’ve been on a poster-making frenzy.  I drew and colored a Gravitation poster of Shuichi, Hiro, and Suguru and taped it on my wall.  I wrote the lyrics to “Super Drive” by Bad Luck in Japanese and put that on a piece of orange construction paper and put it on my wall.  I put up all my favorite pics from Cyco on one wall and it covers half of it.  Oh and I taped my massive “Le Voyage de Chihiro” (Spirited Away in the U.S.) poster to my ceiling over my bed.  When I’m about to go to sleep and the lights are turned off it looks like a giant square black hole about to suck me into another dimension or something.  Anyways, I also started a kind of Kare Kano poster with flower stickers.  I’m writing out what they mean (like white rose = innocence) and putting the word in Japanese beside them.   Well, like I posted earlier, I forced my mom to take me to Barnes and Nobles to buy a manga.  But I got TWO!  Go me!  I got (of course) Gravitation #4 and #5.  But I also got the enjoyment of torturing Victoria ‘cuz she can’t find #4!  Mwuahahaha!!  Oh yes, I’m on an evil roll.  Hmm…that made me think of sandwiches, which made me think of food, which made my stomach hurt.  Ouch.  My friend Sophie (as I mentioned…somewhere) is in town and I want to see her!!  But no, we can’t go see her because I’m stuck at my stupid house!!  She’s been here for almost 4 weeks and I’ve only seen her once.  ONCE!!!  How crazy is that???  I’ll tell you.  It’s insane!!  You wanna know what’s also insane?? (Well, at least horribly irritating)  My Gravitation vol. 2 DVD didn’t come today!!!  ARGH!!!  And I had plenty of time to watch it!!  ARRRRGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!  I’ve been taping anime on Adult Swim and Toonami and I have 8 tapes of it that I haven’t watched yet.  I watched one yesterday, but that alone took me four hours!!  I don’t think I’ll ever watch them all!!  Well, it’s storming and I’m done rambling so I’m gonna go.  Farewell.

        Looks like my blog buddy has abandoned me.  Guess I have to post on my own now.  Damn you, Mictoria, DAMN YOU!!! (I like saying that.)            Oh, I think the hit counter on my website is schitzophrenic or something because it says that 1333742 ppl have visited my site.  That's crazy!!  *sigh* If only it were true...But the same number of ppl as before have signed my g/b!! Urgh! It's so frickin' confusing!!            On a completely different subject, I got my SOL scores the other day and I got Pass/Advanced for everything but Math!! (stupid Math; I only passed that.) And on my English ones I got close to 600!  Woo-hoo! Go me!!           Oh, and in my Taekwondo class on Monday my master said that I'd improved a whole lot in front of the whole class and everyone clapped.  I'm testing for my yellow belt today.  Yay.          Something that really annoys me:  when ppl in the other apartments go in and out of their apartments nonstop.  And when the mailman's late delivering the mail (usually happens when I'm expecting something -_-).          Okay, now for what I'm doing today.  I'm gonna check the mail to see if my Gravitation DVD (vol. 2) is here yet, I'm gonna make a few posters and crap, I'm going to go with my mom to her stupid appointment and listen to Gravitation music on the way, I'm gonna force her to take me to Barnes and Nobles to get a manga, and I'm gonna test for my yellow belt.  Woo.          That's all I have to say.  My fingers hurt.  Sayonara.

       This is   Mictoria   again.   Aren't you excited?  Don't deny it, I know you are.   Okay, so Maybe you aren't.  Well you should be.    Why? I don't know/care/give a shit.  Pick one.  Uno.  Eins.      Don't you love me?  Okay, don't answer that.     Well, you know all about Marlit, so here's some stuff about me:   I'm unusually tall.  I have  pink streaks  in my hair.  I like using big words and massive amounts of sarcasm.  Deal with it.  I have two cats and a hamster that looks like he was genetically fused with a guinea pig and a mop.  I am obsessed with Eerie Queerie and Gravitation.  And guys who are unusually pale......with dark hair.....   My manga collection spans over 70 with about 20-30 different series.   And I don't like crunchy peanut butter.  Pet peeve.      I shall be shutting up now.  Now scamper off and get on with your puny insignificant lives.   Muahahahahaha......   Aren't you glad I posted Marlit?

      I started Reti's song.  Here it is...   I'm surrounded by people but I feel so alone They treat me like a steeple so high; but I'm really just low   Why can't they see that I'm just like everyone else? I'd rather be your knight in shining armor than your stuck-up prince   But what is the most strange of all for you I don't want to be normal   So can I be more to you than everyone else While still being normal? It doesn't seem possible   I'm surrounded by people but I feel so alone They treat me like a steeple so high; but I'm really just low   Gotta go, Bai~

      I've been trying to write a song for Reti to sing in Cyco.  I've got the gist of what I want him to sing about but I can't seem to put it into words.  Oh well...I'm at my Aunt's house right now.  My gramma and me came to visit for a while...so I'm using her computer.  I wish I could work on Cyco right now.  Earlier, I was talking to my gramma about southern accents.  It annoys me when people say puddin' instead of pudding.  lol. Anyway, she usually drops the "g" on most of her "-ing" words.  I discovered that I drop the "g" on "going".  Crap. Well this is an interesting topic...well, we left the house about 3 hours ago (I think) and went to the library (I was looking for a thesaurus so I could work on Reti's song) and my gramma got 4 free books.  I got two, Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus and Don't sweat the small stuff.  (Self-help books) lol. Then we came here. I have nothing else to say, I suppose I'll go.  Sayonara~

        Most of you (more likely all of you) probably have no idea what Cyco is.  It's my webcomic about me and my friends' lives.  It's a comedy, of course.  Anyway, to the point...my website is being stupid, so I'll just post the new pics here.  Here they are:            Okay, well that's it.  bai-bai~

I hate DVD burners...and DVDRs...and that song that's playing on the TV...and...the world...oh yes, the world...I watched Gravitation AGAIN last night....woo...Required Weekly Test of the Emergency Alert System that always frickin starts right in the middle of Angelic Layer...darn them...*BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP*  Ah yes, beep.  Well, I stayed up til midnight last night...aren't I special?  Nothing much is going on in my life...I'm just bored, as usual...*sigh*  Sayonara...

      This is Victoria/Mictoria/Homie-G/That tall girl over there (Depending on who you are.)  Charlotte asked me to put my song on here, so I guess I shall, even though I'll probably regret it later.  It's more like poetry to me, but, whatever.  Tell me what you think, eh? E-mail is MOONCHILD8304500@aol.com.  Untitled (for now)  I don't know what these lyrics are about I just have to say something I need to get free I need to get out  Help me Don't let me drown Save me I don't want to end up like this  I don't know what to say to you I just want you to notice I need to run away I need to be loved  Rescue me Don't let me down Fix me I don't like being alone  Every time I look around It's all the same All falls down To one single thing Do i really care? Do I really need you?  Help me  Don't let me drown Save me  I never want to feel like this  (end song)  Yeah, that's it.  Might be crap, but who gives a shit? This is Mictoria signing off....

         I uploaded the Kyuchi and Aruhi pics that I drew in paint!  Here they are:         They don't have any backgrounds, though.  Oh well...*sigh*  Bai~

       Well, I finished my song! (I think.) If you ask me, it needs a little something more, but I'm afraid that if I add any more verses it will be too long. I was planning for it to be a rather fast song, though. So maybe even if I add something it won't matter. Anyways, here it is, if you care:    I feel so helpless I need a purpose I want to cure this boredom I feel  and it's hard to do this by myself I think I need you it's difficult to tell  I try to escape this world when I can but there's only so much I can take and I give up again  I don't know what to do to get it through to you I can't seem to come out and say how I think about you every day  I feel so helpless I need a purpose I want to cure this emptiness I feel  When I find my other will it help free This breathtaking flutter that causes anxiety?  Everywhere I go I feel so alone and I want to know if you are the one  Who can cure my existence  I feel so helpless I need a purpose I want to cure this longing I feel  It needs something!!! Grr...stupid brain!! On a completely different note, my best friend from England is coming over in an hour to spend the night. She's bringing her GBA, too, so we can battle our Pokemon on Sapphire! Lol, I feel so..."out." Oh well...I was never "in" in the first place so it doesn't really matter. I drew a picture in Paint of the character in my manga (Aruhi from The Legend of the Era-mixer Machine, or E.M.M.) and will probably put it up on my website some time before I go back to my house (I'm at my gramma's for the week). I also drew a pic in Paint of a character that I thought up at my friend Victoria's house a few days ago. He was supposed to be my imaginary friend cuz I was lonely, but I wanted to draw him, too. His name is Kyuchi and he has blue hair and pink eyes and a "Victoria-proclaimed" hour-glass figure. Lol. He's in a band called Oxy-moron, but I can't decide whether to make him the drummer or one of the guitarists. He's gonna be in Cyco, my manga, eventually (in other words, the next time I update, which will be...most likely never ^_^"). *sigh...* So I'll probably put that up eventually, too. I've always wanted to be in a rockish type band called Psykobabble (Victoria named it) and be a lead singer. So I'll put that in Cyco, too. Maybe Kyuchi and I can be band mates...lol The reason I'm typing this is cuz I have nothing else to do and my friend will be here in 30 min. Or she could already be here by the time I post this in my blog. Who knows... I just finished reading I.N.V.U. #2 and I want Sey (?) to wind up with Siho. But that's just my opinion. Sorda. Well, I don't really have anything to say so that's all, I guess. Bai~

      Yes, I slept until 12:00 p.m. again...and I went to bed at 10:00 p.m.!  *sigh* Maybe it was that talk 'til 5 a.m. on tuesday about bishounen that took it out of me...Anyways, I borrowed a lot of manga from my friends (Inu Yasha 4-9, I.N.V.U. 2 and 3, Model #2, Fruits Basket #4, and Eerie Queerie #3) and read DNAngel #3 at their house.  I also bought two manga at Books-a-Million yesterday:  Samurai Deeper KYO #7 and The Candidate for Goddess #1, cuz it's by the same guy who did DNAngel.  Altogether, on my shelves at home, I have 105 graphic novels that belong to me.  That's around $1050 that I've spent on manga!! *faints* Wow...and I have around 11 different anime DVDs (that's about $270 bucks I've spent on anime)! Not to mention all the different posters and other merchandise I have...I probably could have bought a car! (Not that I could drive it, but whatever.)  Oh well.  That's enough calculating for me.  See you...whenever.

        Since the stupid post-thingy didn't want to put my first sentence, here it is: Well, as I'm having an obsession for Gravitation, I looked for a bunch of pics from the anime. I found a whole lot of cute ones ^_^ especially ones of Ryuichi and Shuichi. Go to    urlLink   http://cloverpetals.com/addiction/gallery.html      and see if you can find pics that match these phrases, cuz those are the ones I got:

            Well, as I'm having an obsession for Gravitation, I looked for a bunch of pics from the anime. I found a whole lot of cute ones ^_^ especially ones of Ryuichi and Shuichi. Go to  urlLink http://cloverpetals.com/addiction/gallery.html  and see if you can find pics that match these phrases, cuz those are the ones I got:    ("Hey, Hiro, ask me if something good happened." "Hey, Shuichi, did something good happen?" "It's a se-cr-et!!") , ("And that was the long dream I had." "Hai!" "If only that was the punchline"),  ("Su..." "Su?" "Su.." "Su?" "Suki desu!") , (Me:  Oh... ), and I found a lot more, too. ^_^        Oh, and last night at was at my friend's house and we were talking about the perfect bishounen, and here's what I said: ...let's see...mysterious and aloof, yet not boring and sometimes laughable, has straight hair but isn't too straight, (you know, no bowl hair cuts, lol) and is sometimes messy. And then, uh, body-type: skinny but not a stick with some muscles (particulary in the chest area *cough*) and has to have a really nice personality. And the clothes-style would be either baggy, or kinda like japanese high-school boy uniforms (*sigh*). And not a prep. Definitely goth/punk.       oh yeah, the hair color can't be boring, like blonde (ugh!!!) or a flat brown. like maybe...black with orange streaks or pink, etc. and can have piercings except for on their nose unless it's a ring. uh...and can have lots of ear rings but not only one in each ear. oh, they can have tatoos too but not like all over just on the arms or the back yeah... but I can make a few exceptions of course lol       Oh and his name should be uncommon...Felix, Isaac, Piers or Ivan (from Golden Sun, lol)       I was also writing a song the other day and here are the lyrics I have so far: (not much and not very good, either...-_-)       I feel so helpless I need a purpose I want to cure this boredom I feel       and it's hard to do this by myself I think I need you but it's difficult to tell       I try to escape this world when I can but there's only so much I can take and I remember everything again       I don't know what to do to get it through to you I can't seem to come out and say how I think about you every day       I feel so helpless I need a purpose I need to cure this anxiety I feel        I've been reading a bunch of webcomics lately, too. They are:  urlLink Megatokyo ,  urlLink Modern Sorcerer Shishiro ,  urlLink The Way to Your Heart ,  urlLink Path of a Fallen Angel ,  urlLink Arcana , and a Fruits Basket doujinshi called  urlLink Rainy Day Man .       That's it for now. Talk laterz. ^_______^

        I'm always bored.  I guess that's why I'm doing this blog.  But it's mostly because I want to talk about anime.  ^_^"  I got the first Gravitation DVD yesterday and my aunt's ordering me the second one.  I'm a little (lot) obsessed...  I have my own site that has my webcomics and other drawings on there, but I can't really just talk about anything on there.   I'm also making an attempt at writing a song but I can't think of anything that rhymes...oh well.  My site URL is  urlLink www.narutokun.co.nr  if you want to look.  I also got the OVA soundtrack for Gravi the other day and my aunt's ordering me the TV tracks for my B-Day (September 28th).  I can't really think of anything else to write right now...so Bai~
