      I have to back to school on the 5th. I will be in 10th grade this year and am really looking forward to it.&nbsp; It is going to be great to see all my old friends again.&nbsp;I really missed them this summer. Sometimes it seems as thought I am a loner. Some times I will be with a group and feel like I am not one of them. Some times&nbsp;I just stand there and laugh when they tell a joke or act like I am interested. Some times every thing that I say just comes out wrong. I will try to make a joke and just end up looking like and idiot. But some times thing just seem... Normal. My jokes go off good, people laugh, and I seem to fit in. Some times I wish that I could be more like some of my friends. I can remember sitting back stage watching my friends go on stage and&nbsp;listening to them make people laugh and wondering why I can't do that.&nbsp; For some reason it seems as though this year is going ot be diffrent. I hope that this will be the year that I prove myself to all my friends.

      I have finished all the I have to do for the summer and am now waiting for school to start back up. I did several.... Fun things this summer. First of all I worked on Pinocchio. The show went well and was very successful but I hate working with little kids. And of course when every time one of them messed up it was the older people that got blamed. But I it is always hard working with kids but over all it was fun. I am really going to miss some of the people that I meet while working on this play. So of them go to different schools so I don't see them much.   I am really looking forward to starting back to school.... I never thought I would say that... I am looking forward to seeing some of the people I haven't seen in a long time. I am also looking forward to Adv Theater with Mr. Scott. Plus when school starts back we start on the fall play. This year we are doing The Princess Bride. It is being scripted by two of my friends. I am hoping to make this the play where I change over from Tech Crew to acting.&nbsp; I want to get the part of the giant.   I am still playing bass and am getting better. I now have good number of songs I can play. The bad thing is that the guitarist I played with graduated last year. I could play with Ben but.... He has no rhythm.   For the pass 16 years our school has been the 2AA High School Chess Champs, but I think that this is the year the we will stop winning. It is not that the other team are so much better than all of us, it is just that we don't have as many good players as we had last year. As I see it now our top four goes something like: Ben, Me, Will K., and Bradley R. Bradley... The guy that will hit himself on command. I now he only does because we tell him to but.... He is still the one who does it. I never thought He would be in our top 4.   I took&nbsp; a trip down to Walterboro, Sc. Yes I know that&nbsp;no one knows where is that. Well it is a little town near the coast. It is very hot and there is nothing to do. The only cool thing is that the movies Radio and Forest Gump were filmed there. Now many of you are wondering why the great Zack Gootman would go there. Well I will tell you that&nbsp;I was forced. But I was able to see one of my old friends. We know him as Stoner, Stone Man, or man other names using the word Stone. He really name is long forgotten. He is also called guitar Monkey. It was cool to hang out with him and his girlfriend. I hope to go back and see him sometime.   Well that is about all there is to know about Zack right now... I'm so lonely....

      Sometimes you feel like there is nothing more to say. I mean I let you into my life more than my own brother. I mean a person has to have some privacy in his life. I have some scecrets that no one knows and I want it to stay that way. There are somethings that people will never know about me. And it will stay that way. I live a lie.... I and I am ok with that. I don't know why I don't let people into my life. I just don't. And it will stay that way. I feel as if every one I talk to I don't really know. People say that I am really good with listening, I thinlk that is because I don't like talking about myself. It is not that I am ashamed of my past, I just don't like talking about it. Well people need to know. So I will tell you.  I was born Dec. 8, 1988 in Wheeling, WV. I stayed there till I was 3. Then I moved to Gaffney, SC. I lived there till I was in the third grade. We then moved to Walterboro, SC. I hated that town but when I moved up here in the 8th grade I missed it. In the 9th grade I got into Chess, Quizbowl and Theater. I play bass guitar. Cut and dry.  That seems to be about all that I tell people. I could go into more detail but why waste my time. This blog is about me put if you want to get to know me talk to me. I am online all the time.

      I haven't posted in a while. Well there are some new things in my life. School has started back and I like all but 1 of my classes. I got a part in the play. Not the one I wanted, I will be playing Yeste the swordsmith. Mr. Scott has had another child. Chess club is looking better than I thought it would. And life is good.  Ummm. Well I have to say that I have been really angry of late. Not at any one else but at myself. I claim to be an actor, that I can get up on stage and have people pay to see me perform. But now one of the easiest thing and one of the most common I just can't do it. The simple little line that I would have no problem saying on the stage, I find that in life I just can't. Every time I walk up to this person I get all..... Mixed up. I know what I want to say... I have gone over it a thousand times in my head. When I see her I go up and say hi and talk and say good bye, the whole time my mind is scream at me "say it! Do it, do it now! It is not that hard. three simple words! I love you!" My heart begs me to do it... But I can't! I just can't! And that makes me mad. But when I see her smile.... I don't know what I will do but she has to know and I have to tell her.... I want it to be in person. To see her face, to take her in my arms... But I can't. I know I would mess it but.... Over the phone I still could mess it up... I could write her a letter, but how impersonal is that! I have to tell her in person, it is the only way.

      School starts back tomorrow. I am really looking forward to it. I only wish that I could still sleep in. I most likely get very much sleep tonight. I have a lot on my mind. I can't wait to see all my friends. Some more than others. I am really looking forward to working in the theater dept. again. I worked on a summer childrens play but it was not the same as working with my friends at HHS.

      We went through several bands  names. Most of them were stupid but we finally found one that we like. So from now on the band is called English Graden. Interesting name, it comes from a line from I am The Walrus by the Beatles.

      I am now in a band. Wow!!! That is kinda interesting.... Well every one says that they are in a band I really am. We started the band last Friday. We have 1 song finished and 2 or 3 on the way. RIght now there are 3 members. Elliot Garrou, Ben Gootman, and Me. Elliot and Ben play gutiar and I play bass. I guess that you could say that I am the lead gutairist... Yes a bass play is playing lead... Im not really sure how it ended up like that. We started playing and it was determind that I was the best. So when it came time for the gutair solo it turned into a bass solo. Playing bass the solo was smoother and much deeper than any other solo. This added an interesting sound to the song. Our band hopes to write 6 or 7 good songs and 3 or 4 cover songs and then try to get some gigs. The place that we hope to start off at are like Buds Pub or the Rock. We hope to get into this years Kaliedascope. Hopefully with several new songs and more bass solos this band might go some were.
