      So today I've updated the site again. The site in currently on version 2.2. Basically, that means similar to version 2.1, but just a slight change, and that is the doll on the navigations.  However, I am still trying to find a way to update the site through FTP direct from Dreamweaver.   If there's nothing else, I guess this is all.  Au revoir.

      Alright, I finished the second Star Trek: Interceptor script. It is now available for viewing  urlLink here . I hope it is good enough. I don't think it is suitable for children. No, there are no sexual and explicit contents- I am just trying to be on the safe side. Internet nowadays aren't that save for children.  And it is as promised right? Now I won't start on the next episode yet, until I finished my little series- Love of Different Worlds. Altogether nobody comes to my site and view my crap, I still love my site. I am going to get it up on major search engines soon- Such as Google, Yahoo! And so on, as to get my 25 hits per 3 months thing. My domain have to survive...  For now, got to run...  Au revoir!

      Basically, I updated the Star Trek: Interceptor Eps 2. It's not completed yet, but on the way to be completed soon. It shall be completed this week, I hope.   Next, I added a new Hindi midi for listening pleasure at 6senses. The song is... O O Jane Jana. The song is nice I recommend listening to it. As nice as it seems, please do not attempt to acquire it. Thanks.  That should be all for today. It's getting late now.  Au revoir.

      I woke up darn early today as I was hoping USS Phoenix crew will hold a meeting. But guess not. So I was working on the USS Phoenix new look. It turns out well.   After TKD class then, I get back to the comp, did some editing to Project Piper, and here is what I have done so far:  ->New picture added to gallery ->6senses Superstar karaoke page has an edited correct (hopefully) lyrics  And hopefully by next week, the Star Trek :Interceptor [Deal with the Devil] will be completed. Also, I thought of adding some images of landscapes I made on my own using Terragen program.   That is all I can do and update on for now.  Au revoir.

      So, this is my first post to the blog (I'll call the entries bloggies/bloggy).  I will be adding this blog to my site,  urlLink Project Piper  soon. Do check out my site, please. I need 25 hits per 3 months or I'll lose my URL redirection.  For now, I am busy with three webs. I am a Fleet Admiral of  urlLink USS Phoenix  and XO of  urlLink StarFleet Forces'  USS Orion. The third one would be Project Piper of course.  For now, I'm done.  Au revoir.
