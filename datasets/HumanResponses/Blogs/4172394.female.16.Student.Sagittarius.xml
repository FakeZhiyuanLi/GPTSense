        Went to Lin Hui's house and bake cookies today! It turned out to be so fun! The cookies were Delicious! Haha, the lst batch turned out to be burnt, but nevertheless it still tasted nice. Lol, Valerie was stealing the chocolate chips now and then. Surprised that was still some left. Hoho! Anway, we were laughing ourselves silly most of the time. And me and Valerie tried to put our head out of the window grills. Lucky never get stuck, you will see us on the headlines tomorrow. Lol. Ooo, we were taking lots of the picture, and the cookies burnt right in front of us. Haha...       What a pity that Li Jia Wei lost. She was leading 3 sets to 1. Then the opponent fought back to level. And in the dramatic final set, Li Jia Wei lost by a very very small margin of 9-11. It was so close. But there is still hope! She can still get the bronze and I believe she will!      Damn, lost $5 just now. My heart pains!!! Trying not to think about it. And my brother didn't show any form of sympathy. How mean!      Btw, Man Utd is finally selling Forlan. Amazing how long he lasted that. He is a FLOP! (wahahaha). And Liverpool is gonna trashed Man City! yeah!

        Before I talked about anything else, CONGRATS to Ronald Susilo for making to the quarter finals! The way he beat World No.1 in the first round was brillant! And luckily he kept his composture yesterday when the German level the points. No doubt, the road ahead is tough, but I'm crossing my fingers that he will go all the way! There is the quarter final match at 7pm tonight against the Thailand champ. Good Luck!   The Olympics has been great, producing exicting showdowns and upsets. The swimming events have been sensational. I knew it that Ian Thorpe will defend his 200m free gold. Boy, what a match! Pity that the Australian didn't succeed in defending their 4x200 freestyle relay.       Not much interesting stuffs happened today. Had to clean the cupboard because I'm the QM. Amazing how strentous and horrible it is to clean just a cupboard, and there were like 3 of us doing it. And we haven't complete it! Haha, we tried some cheerleading stuffs, and I think it was disastrous. Lol. Oh, I hate having to call the ex dance seniors to ask about about dance costumes. I tried calling 6, 3 answered, 2 wrong no., 1 without any reply. Is so irritating! (shudders*) I still have 7 to go!! (sobs*)      Oh and there was the Project Work, which I loathe so much. I absolutely see no point of doing PW and how it will help us. I don't even want to start on that topic. It can make a lovely* entry and I shall save it to another day. I'm too hungry to vent my frustration. Lol. Btw, I think we spent most of the time during PW bitching about other stuffs. This certainly bring back fond memories from St Marg's. Hehe. (winks*)      Might be going to Lin Hui's house to bake cookies, along with Valerie. Should be quite fun and exicting! Ooo, is been a while since I baked anything. Was going to bake cookies with Felicia and Mum Yeng during 1st 3 months. But I was sick on that day and had to miss it. Those cookies were heavenly delicious!!! Yummy! They were so sweet to give me the unburnt ones, coz I was having a sore throat.       Ah, I always so lethargic these days. Need some pumping music to get me going. The thing is there is hardly any nice dancy songs on air. Oh well, going to stop here. I'm too hungry to continue.....

       Saturday was the kick off for both the new season of EPL and the Olympics. Plenty of actions to be talked about.         Soccer       Yup, the news that all Liverpool fans that are talking about. Owen leaving Liverpool for Real Madrid. It does come like a shock, coz all seems well about him signing a new contract. Then the signs appears, he didn't played for the CL qualifer. And wham, Owen is leaving fot Real Madrid. Well, to be honest I didn't really feel sad, feel that Gerrard is more impt than him. But I do think is silly of Owen to go Real, when they have so many gd strikers. Like Raul, Ronaldo, Morenities. When will it be his turn? (sigh)      Anyway, Liverpool kicked off the season by drawing with Spurs. I thought is a match they should win. Well, is gd that Cisse scored on his debut EPL match. But didn't understand why Benitez took him off and later Baros off too. Denfensive, to hold on to the 1 goal lead? Anyway it backed fired, when Defoe equalised.      And the match everyone is concerned about. Chelsea vs Man Utd. Everyone seems to going for Chelsea. But I think Man Utd might pull off a draw....          Olympics     Well, is mainly the heats on the 1st day of Olympics. But there was the 400m freeystyle final. For a moment, I thought Ian Thorpe is going to lose to his countryman. But he edged out to grab the gold. Sure, it wasn't near his own WR, but is still a gold medal. Moving on to 400 IM, Michael Phelps broke his WR and won the gold. It was a easy win, no strong contenders. It will be interesting day at the pool, as Phelps vs Thorpe in the 200m free.(which Thrope is the WR holder) I think Thorpe is going to win it, crushing Phelps hope for matching Spitez's 7 gold medal haul. Very interesting, indeed....

        Oh I saw "The Lone Drow" at MPH!!! Finally the paperback is out! But it costs $18 plus. So expensive, I better get it at Sans bookshop at West Mall. (sigh) I have to wait until next year to get the 3rd book in paperback. Oh! I want to get "Da Vinci Code" too, is around $17. Damn, so many things to get but I'm broke! (sulk) Ah, I probably will get my hands on "The Lone Drow" soon. Can't wait!      That game "Doom 3" has the honor of the first game that really spooks me. Fine, I admit, I'm quite a chicken when playing this type of game. That's why I prefer playing RPG's and adventure. Nevermind about that. Ok, I played arounf 20 mins of Doom 3, and that is enough for me. Of course, it didn't help that I played it at night. (my bro suggest I should have played without the lights on!) So now, I'm just an observer watching my bro playes it.      Anyway, is quite scary to have a bunch of moaning zombie surrounding you, with the damn lights flickering. And you don't know when something will jump on you. When you shoot them up close, the blood spattered on the screen. And yesterday, when my brother was playing it, there was this girl whispering away, and then a baby crying at the background. Now, how scary is that? Is pure spooky. Hmm...i might just try my hands on that game again. If I have the time during the day, that is... Lol...

       Caught Singapore Idol right after the National Parade. I must said I'm pretty amazing. Some of those people are down right thick-skinned! Who will ever forget the guy who sang "Lemon Tree". My gosh, I think Singapore Idol is the only place which you can see grown man, dancing like a i-don't-know-what. Where is he going to hide his face after his "spectacular" performance? Ok, atleast he was hilarious and entertaining.      Now, the guy who stripped, and claims he is a "famous eyebrow plucker" is just pure disguesting! Shameless! I don't find him funny, not even a tiny bit. He is just pure disgust. (shudders*)       Ah, and that guy that sang George Michael's Careless Whisper. He literally sang that song that way. My bro shown me a picture of him that someone posted on the net. Guess what was the background? A shop with the sign "Hearing Aids Specialist". Lol, that guy surely needs that!       Lol, I can't wait to watch tomorrow episode. Listening to people howling away, and the judges' critical remarks! But damn, it clashes with CSI Miama season 2. I just figure something out. Oh! There is school tomorrow! Damn! (sobs*)       Latest Soccer News    Guess what? It turns out that Danny Murphy is not going to Spurs after all, since it cannot guarantee him a first place spot. Oh, it seems he is heading for Charlton... And another thing that is getting on my nerve is, when is Owen going to sign that damn contract? From the end of last season to now, he kept saying he is going to sign soon. But when is soon? I hope he is not planning to pull of a "McManamam" stunt. Coz if he does that, every Liverpool is going to hate him! Latest news: it seems that Real Sociedad's Alonso is heading to Anfield. Yeah! Whee! Liverpool seems to be in great shape to take on the new season! I can't wait! It just 3 more days! And....there is the Olympics!!! This is just going to be wonderful!! Cheers!

       Woke up early today coz it is Singapore's 39th birthday. Yeah, right. I bet nobody buys that. The reason why I woke up so early is coz I went for breakfast. So yeah, is the country birthday, but I don't get the spirit, if you know what I mean. I'm looking forward to watching Singapore Idol than watching the national parade. That's right, I have said it, shoot me....      Is always the same old thing over and over again. Almost routine like. Somehow I have the feeling they are trying to paint a picture perfect thing. Everyone clutching to a Singapore flag, singing national day song., being patriotic Well, it a rare sight, that only happens today.       Oh well, perhaps is just too early in the morning that I'm feeling this way. Hopefully, the national day fever bug will catch me. And yes, I will be watching the national day parade....       Btw, Danny Murphy is leaving for Tottenham. Well, I'm not really surprised, I was wondering when will this day arrives. I mean Murphy is a good player and hardworking. But he is not exactly a fantastic player, if you know what I mean. I always thought he would not last long in Liverpool, but he have surprised me by staying so long. To be fair, he had his days during Houllier's time. Well, all the best to him at Spurs, joining Rednkapp. The ironic thing is Liverpool will be facing Spurs next Saturday, 1st match of the season. Interesting to see how it turns out. But of course, Liverpool will win!

      Hit town on Saturday with Reshpal and Divya. We caught the movie "The Village". Great movie with a shocking twist, which I won't reveal and spoilt the story. The movie leaves you pondering... I was so happy that when Seemanti joined us later on. We went to take neo prints, which turns out to be fantastic! Amazing that we haven't take neo prints together. What were we doing for the past few years? We were just roaming around Hereen. Oh, we were attracted to the shop with the neon sign "Nude girls live". Yup, that shop. In case anyone is wondering, it just a shop selling lingerie. Ah, I remember walking past the tattoo shop, and there was this guy with a stony face, guess he didn't appreciate all these people gawking at him. Then when we walked past again like 20 mins later, he was still there, except he was topless with a curtain drawn. I bet it must have hurt.(shudders) There was a little drama we had at Burger King at Far East. Seemanti left her phone there, when we went back it was gone. The cleaning lady denied seeing her phone. We requested to the manager that they checked the dustbins, while Divya called her phone. But it was in vibration mode. Nothing was found in the bins. Just when we were at a loss of what to do, the lady took out her phone. The manger asked her where she got it from, and she claimed it was from the bin at the back. Without making a fuss, we left. But we were adamant she took, she thinks we are stupid of what?(rolling my eyes) And that's kinda sum up our little adventure. It was great to meet the rest after so long. Hopefully, we will still be able to meet up like that in the near future!
