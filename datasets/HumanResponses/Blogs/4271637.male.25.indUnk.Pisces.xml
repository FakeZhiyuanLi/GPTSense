      I tend to get somewhat dreary when I write, what ends up being somewhat dramatic where there is no need.  I guess I feel the need to compose elaborately due to the years of emails that have dulled what little ability at written communication I ever had.  If you look back a hundred years at those people that could read and write, they tended to be much more eloquent than we can even pretend we are today.  Don't get me wrong, there are of course so many of us out there that can pull and push emotions with words just as musicians.  None the less it seems that ability has become more rare even has literacy has spread.  We of course will always have the speech writers and the script writers and fantastic authors or novels and stories.  What I am afraid of is that the common man and woman are being pushed into a less is more kind of attitude that seems so very inappropriate in a language as florid as English can be.  It is somewhat ironic that I write this on the web, as I think the internet as a whole has been the largest purveyor of the 'C U L8R' attitude.  In any case, I hope you will bear with me when I come off as obviously pretentious.  I am not actually as silly as I probably appear, but I have to push myself to an extreme to balance the other end of the equation.  I hope you all had a good weekend.  Sleep well.

      I spent a week in New Mexico hiking when I was in high school, and even now almost 10 years later (ugh) the one salient memory that floats just below the ripples of my conscious mind is the night sky.  I can literally say that the night sky in and around washington DC pales in comparison.  There truly is very little like seeing the stars unhindered by light and clouds.  It all at once fills you with the wonder and beauty of life, and simultaneuously makes you feel infinitesimally small.  A seemingly incongrous balance between joy and despair.  I suppose it depends greatly on what view you take.  Nothing I ever do will change that night sky.  Now, there are lots of things that won't change during my lifetime, but I know that if I put my mind to it I can make a change where I want.  The night sky however, the universe, will never know who I am, where I lived, who my friends were.  We are but the ants of the galaxy, and yet even ants are noticed by us, where as I doubt the galaxy pays us any homage.  And yet, and yet, that we are here, a grain of sparkling sand in a desert, each unique, makes us all the more special for our individuality.  I am alone among the stars, there is no other like me, and the greater the universe is on one side of the scale, only makes my own life the heavier on the other.  We are but ants, and yet each one of us is a giant, fore there will never be another like us.  "To go into solitude, a man needs to retire as much from his chamber as from society.  I am not solitary whilst I read and write, though nobody is with me.  But if a man would be alone, let him look at the stars.  The rays that come from those heavenly worlds will separate between him and what he touches.  One might think the atmosphere was made transparent with this design, to give man, in the heavenly bodies, the perpetual presence of the sublime.  Seen in the streets of cities, how great they are!  If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore; and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God which had been shown!  But every night come out these envoys of beauty, and light the universe with their admonishing smile."  -Raplh Waldo Emerson  I miss those stars of New Mexico greatly, but never hesitate to gaze upon the stars wherever I may be.

      It's interesting how we have evolved.  I don't mean biologically, but socially.  Little things that sometimes go unnoticed, without even the dimmness of the dying day they are gone from our life.  Once upon a time, as I'm sure anyone who has seen 'Quest for Fire' may attest, there was actually a time when we as humans found value in sitting around a fire and bathing in not only the warming glow of slowly burning embers, but of each other.  A long time past before we moved away from the fire pit, but we did, and not surprisingly we moved toward the constant hum of our electronics.  First radio, then TV, then computers, and with each step we got farther away from one another.  Now isolated with our little brightly lit boxes we yearn to be back by the fire, back with people, with stories of love and hope and loss and courage.  So I suppose it is appropriate somehow that we find our little blogs, our own little fires, and sit and await for the shadows to push backward as other come to sit with us, and talk, and smile, and stay warm.  Stay warm everyone, and keep those fire burning.

      I suppose if there is anything to say at first, it does not have to be my own words, and so I choose another's:  How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth, Stolen on his wing my three and twentieth year! My hasting days fly on with full career, But my late spring no bud or blossom shew’th.  Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth, That I to manhood am arrived so near, And inward ripeness doth much less appear, That some more timely-happy spirits endu’th.  Yet, be it less or more, or soon or slow, It shall be still in strictest measure even To that same lot, however mean or high,  Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heaven; All is: if I have grace to use it so, As ever in my great Task-Master’s eye.  - John Milton  Have no fear though, rarely it is that I choose to philosophize with anyone other than myself, especially from a pulpit so public as this. I find myself none the less in the doldrums of life at the youthful age of twenty-five. Four years as a contractor in our venerable government have alas not sharpened my skill or my wit, but left me with doubt and cynicism. As I open the paper in the morning to find the headline "Study: Rich Getting Richer" I find it hard not to add a layer to the pearl of despondency growing within.  I of course digress, not all is lost, nor is every horizon crested by black sails. The beauty of life, and love, and laughter, will always be found by those who look for it, and thankfully I have searched and found it in many places.
