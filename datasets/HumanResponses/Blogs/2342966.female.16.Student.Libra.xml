Thing is me n haz used 2 av aruguements like....all tha time....but we always eventually made up, there wernt usually n e slaggin off or n e thin.....but i herd summit tht parently her n vix were laffin @ in tutor....summit they sed bout me....n as much as i dnt wanna say it....it did hurt when i found out coz i think tht she has crossed the line by saying it if its troo, wot have i sed about u to deserve tht?! I have bin workin so much ova tha last few days i hope it all pays off! it has completeley worn me out, i jst wanna sleep for a while, but tht ent gonna happen!?!?!? n e ways.....on a not so higher note, im stuk im weymouth rite this minute, i got separated from ma bro sum how, n now im left with all tha fekkin old ppl, like tha rents n tht....i reallee more than n e fin dnt wanna b here rite now.
