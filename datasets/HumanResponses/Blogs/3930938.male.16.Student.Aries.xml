      Mollie the collie stretches her legs, leaning forward and emitting a silent yawn. The chapel is empty; there is no need to search out a seat on the burnished wooden benches. The "dog handlers" wave as I pass them by, entering the chapel through the open sides. Occasionally, during the service, I will glance at the doors, hung flush to the ceiling, and ponder the question posed by Greg in the dining hall: "What would happen if one of them fell?" The service begins with the processional, which was usually a song i didn't know. Once, however, there was amazing grace, a familiar tune, and on Sunday the recessional was "Mine Eyes Have Seen the Coming." While I knew the first verse by heart, I was hopelessly lost on the second without the psalm sheet. The two Senior Patrol Leaders beside me didn't have sheets, either, and didn't seem to make an effort to sing. Most didn't, really, and given the substandard nature of my singing I almost took the hint. Perhaps I really am tone deaf. Father Chris mounts the altar, and the service begins. He has a fine voice, and I manage to learn quickly most of the elements of the mass. The readers are always younger scouts, not entirely sure of themselves at the pulpit. I could have spoken, but what impression would I have made? The entire week i took communion not once. I sheepishly stood aside while others filed past me on Sunday, to the suppressed befuddlement of those two SPL's as they walked to the back of the church to take the host from an adult minister. I sat down while everyone else stood, giving thought to entirely irrelevant considerations: Buddhism, the empty nature of communion for those who take it unthinkingly, and what I would say were someone to ask me my justification for not taking communion. Sure, I was never baptized, but I also was never confessed. Buddhism begins to seem like a natural progression, an introspective faith devoted to nonviolence and detachment; sounds familiar when i write this now, though. Asceticism seems to be attractive up to a certain point, but the boundaries and exact circumstances remain vague. The week ended without a definitive answer to that question. My finger is a bit more trained at the shutter; capturing moments seems more natural. It's easier to take photos when Iâ€™m convinced that film and the processing are cheap, and the few good photos justify the expense of processing and taking those that honestly wouldn't be worth it alone. I'm one week and six rolls of film closer to being the photographer i should have been all along. Farewell, Camp Yawgoog. I knew ye well.

      To start, yesterday:  The SEPTA conductor almost passed me by, leaving me to ride the train free. Or so I thought. The conscience intervened and had me hold out my prepaid Market East ticket for him to punch a dozen times. I could have sworn that someone gave me a look; I had, after all, tried to pay Septa. Isn't petty theft the American way? Not in those words.  I followed a man to the PATCO, stage two of the homeward journey for this peripatetic soul. Moderate height, overall unassuming man with a greasy balding haircut and thick glasses made of swirling black/brown translucent plastic. The type not commonly considered "fashionable" since some time in the dark ages of the 1980s. Beige shirt, leather suitcase. Hurrying somewhere, I thought to the PATCO unitl he turned to board the Blue line. I'm sure he was a nice guy, in his own way. He held the door open twice, despite his obvious desire to scamper off to wherever he was headed at 10:50 AM.  Visiting my grandmother is always a pleasure, although  I haven't anything against her and realize that none of this was her fault. She has no control over the 3 hour drive through the urbanized desolation of North Jersey; a landscape made bleak by its population of thousands, each a silent motorist elbowing his way through the traffic. The endless stacks of containers call for a use, perhaps as low income rural housing? They already use them for storage. How would you make them weatherproof, though?  Rt. 17 had us meet a National Wholesale Liquidators, a massive store of size equal or greater than that of the Springfield Mall. The high ceilings gave an impression of the warehouse reborn, populated by listlessly scurrying knots of shoppers, despite the building's apparent recency. The storefront looked vaguely similar to the Home Depot on Rt. 70. There's no end to what they stocked, really, and we got Turkish Delight for ourselves and Nonpariels for my grandmother. She's always loved dark chocolate.  The Maple Glen ElderCare Center was no different than usual, and no less than 3 different senior citizens asked me to drive them home. I always get that, for some reason. We spent most of the time outside, and I had the pleasure of hearing my mother recount the story of my dad's business for the billionth time. It's already degraded into a routine, yet each time I strain to hear what's next, as though some new development looms large.  I'm explaining all of this to another version of myself, nestled securely in some region I'll never explore, disguised as a person I'll never meet. Maybe he [or she?] is holding the answer booklet, paging through it expectantly. I imagine it's neat and old, with a seriff font on crisp white paper yellowed on the edges. The type of book you'd expect to find at a library book sale for $.30, lodged alongside an abandoned Shakespeare and an outdated biology textbook with a slightly torn cover. The Shakespeare juts out slightly, and the oversized bio text leans over them both in a maternally protective guesture. From most angles, you'd never even notice The Answer Booklet.

      The title of the blog itself, arising simply because it is a "Required Field Cannot Be Left Blank," is derived from a composition book i used to write in. Recently, out of frustration at the various, overly sentimental scrawlings I made on the cover, I blacked out all the words save the "Positions" in "Compositions" [I was in the process of blacking the entire word] and my name. The composition book's contents disgust me no less, but masking it all would be too great an effort given the questionable reward of destroying pages of written material. Almost all of the aspects of this site stem from the fact that i have to put something there to begin with. Yesterday and today i've been at Sean's house; I hadn't been here for weeks. The fact that i had things to do which could only be done from my house complicated matters, but in all honesty i've been in something of an antisocial depression for a while. It's not only the situation surrounding my dad's job and the prospect of moving; something else, a general desire to escape everything, even those things which i can say [without certainty, of course] that i like, pervades. I feel that because i live in a world with multiple "bases of operation" my life is needlessly complicated. Why should i have to return home to attend to my ebay auctions? Why should home be there anyways? And even Swarthmore seems distant when juxtaposed against Philadelphia, a place i have begun to regard as more natural by the day. It's not just business, or even the social situation. Having divided location means that means for self improvement are equally divided. If i were to take guitar lessons it would have to be near my house, yet it's a place i long to escape. I can't go to lessons here in Swarthmore, and while i could take lessons in Philadelphia transportation would, as always, complicate matters. I just feel as though i am, in a sense, homeless. Earlier today i made a concerted effort to listen to the songs on my iPod i got from Sean a while back; they're mostly popular songs, and aren't the sort of music that i'd generally listen to. They are, however, the sorts of songs you'd expect to [or perhaps even have] hear on the radio. I had myself convinced that i was enjoying it, getting to hear "modern classics," getting more "in touch" with modern society; I realized then, finally, that much of my "confusion" is merely subconcious farce.
