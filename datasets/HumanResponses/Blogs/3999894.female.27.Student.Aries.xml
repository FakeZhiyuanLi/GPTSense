      After what might be termed a 'lively' meeting, the details of which are below, participants agreed to meet again in September to consider a more formal action plan for the area. Steve from Eton Manor Running Club kindly agreed to act as rapporteur for this plan pulling together the various ideas people had into something more formal. I would hope too at the next meeting a more formal Friends group can then be set up to take the plan forward and work with partner agencies such as BCTV, the local authority etc on the plan. Personally, I think key to the future of the site will be developing a plan which reflects the two sides of the area that people like best- all the activities and sporting facilities they enjoy and the slightly wild, open space,&nbsp;quiet, contemplative aspect of visiting Marsh Lane Fields.&nbsp;This probably means we need to look at some sort of 'zoning' plan for the area, with a clear management strategy to ensure no one area is damaged by over use or mis-use. I also hope that the differing&nbsp;bodies who use the site for sporting activities&nbsp;such as the running club, LA Raiders and the Lammas School&nbsp;can work together on a single proposal as I think we'll stand more chance of both&nbsp;gaining funding for this and achieving a consensus&nbsp;about the future of Marsh Lane Fields. However, as I stressed last night,&nbsp;its upto local residents to decide what they want and to make it happen&nbsp;- I'm keen to help as much as I can&nbsp;but the group needs to be&nbsp;more than a talking&nbsp;shop if it is to achieve&nbsp;its ambitions for Marsh Lane Fields! &nbsp;I'm happy for people to use this blog as a forum to comment on the points raised or add their own or you can email me on  urlLink cllrs.creasy@lbwf.gov.uk  &nbsp;or steve on  urlLink etonmanor@aol.com  with your views if you would prefer not to post publicly. As soon as I know the date of the next meeting I'll post it on here too.&nbsp;If anyone knows of an interested party in this who isn't on email but would like to be kept upto&nbsp;date with the debate please get in touch and I'll make sure they get sent copies of the comments. &nbsp;

      Further to last night's meeting, these are the notes I took of the points people made about what they would like to see happen at Marsh Lane Fields. I've tried all morning to work out how to post this as a word file people can download but I have to admit defeat so I apologise for the long post! I'll put the rest of the details in a seperate posting to help ! Doing it this way also seems to have ruined the formatting but hope this makes sense. Email me if you want the list as a word document on email just in case!     Friends of Marsh Lane Fields Brainstorming Session Eton Manor Clubhouse, 27th July 2004  Many residents walk their dogs at the site. Concern about the dog waste bins, the prevalence of broken class and horse manure which make the site a poor comparison to Hackney marshes. The nature trails signs are broken but still advertised in borough programmes. Scouts use the site but don’t use the lower fields because of the horse manure.  We need wardens or a park keeper for the site. The Running Club is a community based athletics association but the back of the club is being used as a dumping ground for rubbish. In particular council has left old play equipment there which is encouraging flytipping.  The Running Club would be interested in participating in a trust to run their building and develop their facilities. Also working with local schools including George Mitchell, Lammas School and the SCORE project with regard to the new track at Ive Farm. LA Raiders interested in participating in a trust to run their building and develop their facilities. Looking to work with other partners at the site to develop a project for sports facilities.  Cyclists also use the facility but get attacked by the animals, concerned by horse manure, condition of pathways and inaccessibility of the Marsh Lane Bridge. Geese in particular a problem! Residents like the rural feeling of the area – like the open space and don’t want facility to be too formal or too ordered. Access to the bridge a key issue. Triangle of land – gas works land? Is it contaminated? Could it be reclaimed?  Access to the site difficult for the disabled because of uneven paths etc. Lammas School not using the site as much as they would like because of the poor condition of land e.g. horse manure, broken glass. Also had problems with animals entering school property! School plans to specialise in sports activities so may be interested in working with partners to develop facilities at site.&nbsp;  Walkers like the open area , the fact the site is relatively free of hedges and fences. Need to work with Lea Valley Partnership – should think about not just what is in Marsh Lane but how the area connects with surrounding areas.  Public toilets needed – both the running club and LA Raiders regularly asked to provide facilities by visiting public. Both clubs would be willing to maintain such a facility. Profile of the area poor- not very many people know about activities at area. Signs up still mention Afro-Caribbean centre.  Could link into the Marina ? Olympics planning will see the enclosure of the electricity pylons at Stratford – could we do the same? Any Friends group would need to work with other groups in the area. The gates need to be locked to stop people accessing the site and dumping rubbish. Schools who use the site such as Sybourn, St Josephs and Church Mead need traffic management and a turning space for cars dropping people off.  Decontamination of site, in particular the asbestos at the far end of the site and potential damage from the gas works. Could we have a land survey? SCORE project – what are the facility charges and how were they decided? What role does Ray who lives on the site have? what time does he have allocated to the maintenance of the site?  Long term maintenance of the site and a proper budget for this key to its future. The trees are being strangled and need attendance. Most of the broken glass and rubbish comes from football players on a Sunday – cleansing happens before matches rather than afterwards when problem is biggest.  management of grass needs to be better – need to fence off areas which are damaged to help grass to grow back.  Large events should pay for cleansing of area afterwards. Also local groups need to be told dates of these events in advance.  The wooden posts stopping cars entering the site are damaged – SCORE project replacing these?  Open Spaces group came up with ideas about the area and a possible Friends group but nothing seems to be happening – can we have an update on what they said and involve them in the discussions.

      Further to my earlier post I've now had a map of where the proposed crossing will be. The deadline for consultation on the new crossing is the 24th August 2004 and letters have been delivered to residents along the Lea Bridge Road near the proposed site. I've asked for a copy of the map in a form I can post on here so that residents who want to see it can get it from here too but you can also send your comments to me and I'll forward them onto the consultation process. Looking at the map the site is basically half way between Melbourne Road and Whitney Road outside 530/532 Lea Bridge Road westbound and 497 Lea Bridge Road eastbound. As well as being a traffic signal controlled crossing, it will also include zig zag markings and a 50 metre anti-skid surface either side of the actual crossing. The plans also propose changes to the parking bays at the top of Melbourne Road and Whitney Road to allow loading and unloading for the shops whose frontages would be affected by the introduction of the zig zags. I know there has been substantial concern about road traffic accidents at this site so it is important local residents help ensure we get this crossing sited in the right place so please do get in touch if you have any views about the proposals.

      Apologises for the bad pun.....Ade, the vicar at Emmanuel, has asked me to put a link to the Emmanuel Church website on this blog. I'm not sure how to get links to appear alongside the text (or indeed how to get the archive to appear a bit further up the page) so I've put it here as a post but if&nbsp;anyone who knows how to do that please do get in touch! I'm happy to post up links to sites of interest for Lea Bridge residents so if you want me to put a link to your site let me know - in the meantime here is the link to Emmanuel's website  urlLink http://www.emmanuelleyton.org.uk/

       urlLink    To help encourage readers to get involved in the next event at the Lea Bridge Library I thought I would remind readers of how great the last event was by posting some of the photos from the event. This was the Children's Fun Day on the 25th April 2004.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've got lots of photos but I can't work out how to post more than one picture at a time!  urlLink

      Its taken a long time but I've been informed that EDF energy have finally arranged to move the illuminated advertising sign on Lea Bridge Road opposite Melbourne Road back to the rear of the footpath. This is now due to happen by the end of July 2004. Several residents have complained to me about the sign, fearing it blocked the view of buses coming along the road and was thus responsible for accidents on the road. Its taken a long time to get EDF to give us a date for the disconnection of power so that the sign can be re-sited. We have also submitted a bid to put a zebra crossing on Lea Bridge Road at that site to Transport for London - I'll let you know as soon as I hear about the outcome.

      The next meeting of the Lea Bridge Library Friends Committee is the 1st September 2004 at the Lea Bridge Library from 6.30pm. The Group are currently planning their "International Day" event at the library on the 4th September and they are looking for local entertainers and performers who can help represent the range of cultures and nationalities living in Lea Bridge at the event. If you think you can help out get in touch and I'll put you in touch with the Group or come along to the meeting on the 1st.

      Together with the local MP Neil Gerrard, the leader of Waltham Forest Council Cllr Clyde Loakes, our GLA member Jennette Arnold and local community activists and residents I was involved in a campaign to save the footbridge in the Marsh Lane site which connects up the Walthamstow, Leyton and Hackney marshes. As part of the construction of a new Channel Tunnel Depot at Leyton Temple Mills the railway company had proposed to remove the bridge and not to replace this ancient right of way. However, after a concerted campaign which involved a petition signed by over 2,000 local residents and a public meeting attended by 200 people Channel Tunnel have withdrawn their plans and the footbridge is to remain for the time being as the development is being scaled down. Neil, Clyde and myself are now pressing for improvements to the bridge to be made - for example making it accessible by cyclists, those in wheelchairs and with pushchairs - and for a commitment to be made that when the depot is further developed in the future the right of way will be protected. As the local councillor for the site I am also trying to set up a "Friends Group" for Marsh Lane to get local people involved in planning for the future of this greenspace and our first public meeting will be held at the Eton Manor Running Club in Marsh Lane on Tuesday 27th July 2004 at 8.30pm. All interested residents are welcome to attend and I will post to this blog with developments on both the friends group and the footbridge as and when they happen. The campaign set up its own website which can be found here -  urlLink http://www.eton-manor.com/saveourbridge .

      To help give some idea&nbsp;what life in Lea Bridge is like these are some key statistics about the ward taken from the 2001 census&nbsp;:   -22% of the ward population is under 16.  -54% are from the Black and Minority Ethnic Groups.  -There are 1,647 households with dependent children out of a ward total of 5,029 households.  -16% of households have children aged 0 – 4 years.  -Lea Bridge has the fifth highest level of one parent families in Waltham Forest with 549 one –parent households.  -56% of residents are in employment compared with the borough average of 59%.  -29% of residents have no qualifications at all , in line with the Waltham Forest borough average.    Here is a link to the census data about Waltham Forest as a whole&nbsp; -  urlLink http://www.lbwf.gov.uk/london-census2001.pdf

         Welcome to the Lea Bridge Life Blog! My name is Stella Creasy and I am a councillor for Lea Bridge Ward in Waltham Forest in London.&nbsp;I'm not very technologically advanced so I hope those of you reading this will bear with me as I try to get to grips with blogging - it is my hope that&nbsp;this blog can be a forum about Lea Bridge Ward in Waltham Forest and a point of information, discussion and dialogue for past, present and future residents about the changes they would like to see happen in their local community.&nbsp; We've got an exciting time ahead of us in Lea Bridge because a lot of investment is coming to the area- to give just one example over the coming two years £400,000 will be invested in improving public services in Lea Bridge through the Government's Neighbourhood Renewal Fund. Local residents will have to decide how that money is spent and what priorities we as the local authority should focus on and I hope this blog can help inform that process. I will also try to keep readers updated on our progress on tackling other issues around Lea Bridge too and perhaps also give you an insight into what I do as your local councillor and give people from outside the Walthamstow area an idea of what Lea Bridge is like! I'd be very interested to hear from anyone who reads this what they think of the blog and any suggestions for what information I should post.

      I have been notified that the Bakers Arms area has been agreed as the next area for consideration for a controlled parking zone, with the centre of the zone focused on the Bakers Arms junction itself. I must stress at this point that no other decisions have been taken so far on this issue e.g. the area involved, the consultation process etc. Furthermore, as there are CPZ's either side of the area in Leyton and along Hoe Street it is more than likely that these will be re-visited in conjunction with whatever is proposed for the Bakers Arms area. At present I also have no timescale for the project although it is proposed that the issue will be discussed at a Community Council before the end of this year.  The new CPZ consultation process (agreed by the Council last September) is in two stages - the first stage concentrates on the residential roads within a short walk of the centre of congestion.  If a majority from this area are in favour a second-stage consultation is then carried out including roads up to half a mile from the centre - which may also be affected.   I am sure a new CPZ will evoke strong feelings either way for residents and I will update the blog as I hear more details of the timescale for the consultation process. In the meantime if residents want to email me their comments about the idea at  urlLink cllrs.creasy@lbwf.gov.uk  or discuss them on this blog I'd be interested to hear.

      A local resident and student is doing a study on perceptions of crime in Waltham Forest as part of his masters course at City University.  As part of the study he is looking for as many local residents as possible to take part in his research by filling in a survey about their views on where in the borough you think suffers from high crime. You can fill in the short questionnaire on line here  urlLink http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ap776/  or you can request a paper copy from the researcher ( urlLink k.m.cressy@city.ac.uk ) The deadline for taking part is the 15th August 2004 and I'm sure it will make very interesting reading - If you don't want to take part but are interested in the outcome you can look at the results so far here  urlLink http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ap776/applets/taggerQuery.htm?

      Several residents have emailed me asking what a blog is - this link is on the BBC site so I thought I would post it as it probably explains better than I can !  urlLink http://www.bbc.co.uk/webwise/askbruce/articles/browse/blogging_1.shtml  Incidentally, if you are more interested the second link takes you to lots of links that help you set up your own blogs  urlLink http://robotwisdom.com/weblogs/  - perhaps Lea Bridge could become the first fully blogged ward......
