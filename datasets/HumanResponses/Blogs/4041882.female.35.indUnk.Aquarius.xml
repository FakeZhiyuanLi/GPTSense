      I just got caught up in other activities...  It's FRIDAY, y'all!&nbsp; I promise I'll come up with a super-duper entry today at some point.&nbsp; Got many inspirations from Kandace S. (who I probably should just give access to so she can post it herself, but she's even busier than I am)...  Question of the day...is it wrong to call an old friend's mother to find out what happened to him/her and get a new address?&nbsp; Most people are OK with it, I guess, but a few thought it was akin to stalking.&nbsp; I welcome comments on this issue as I don't wanna get arrested...they don't let you blog in prison, I don't think.

      Hey folks...  quick note.&nbsp; All is well in the Neighborhood of Make Believe, and I'll come up with a topic later on this AM...it's my job to go through the papers each day and cut out clippings pertaining to animals, but other stuff catches my eye too.&nbsp; If I see anything noteworthy, I'll comment on it in my usual style.

      Just heard from another friend (Robbin S.) that her two oldest daughters are in the "new teenage driver" category...my heart breaks for her, but also leaps with joy at the fact that I have a cat and cats don't drive!!&nbsp; YAY!  Anyway, here's a little tip from the former GEICO bunny...if you are reading this and have a son/daughter in the driving category, check with your insurance company and see if they have a good student and/or college student discount.&nbsp; If they do, and your child qualifies, it could save you beaucoup bucks, ya know?&nbsp; Just an idea, unless you LIKE having a high-rated driver on your policy and WANT to pay higher premiums...  At any rate, let's be careful out there, both with ourselves and with each other, 'k ?  Sudiegirl

      OK, props to Kandace S. again...she is a dear friend (perhaps one of my dearest) from high school, and the reason we get along so very well is because we think a lot alike.&nbsp; It scares most people, including her ex-husband and my significant other, but we don't mind.&nbsp; We think it's fun...  Anyway, we e-mail each other a lot, so much in fact it seems like instant messaging instead.  Today, we got on the subject on women's attire and what men like.&nbsp; Keep in mind that both of us (and probably many other readers of this) are plus-sized, beautiful women and were thin once back in the day so we know the gamut of what can/cannot be worn.&nbsp; We are also children of the 80's, which signifies big hair, tight straight-leg jeans, and neon.&nbsp; With all those qualifications, she and I feel that we are pretty experienced and can comment knowledgably on stuff like this.&nbsp;   First, let's discuss the concept of stiletto heels.&nbsp; From my days in Italian class, "stiletto" is Italian for a certain type of knife, and yes, that's what they feel like when they're on.&nbsp; Why men would want us to wear these shoes is beyond me.&nbsp; First of all, they're ultimately bad for your feet, causing a woman to balance all her weight on one part of the foot as opposed to all the foot.&nbsp; Yes, I know Barbie wears high heels, but she's also plastic, weighs less than 2 lbs and has "made in Taiwan" tattooed on her ass.&nbsp; Do not bring that example before me because it's totally invalid.&nbsp; The point I'm trying to make here is that wearing stilettos is on a par with foot-binding, and how many women actually wear them all day long besides the chicks on "Sex and the City", who are actresses and are able to put up their feet and/or make emergency trips to the podiatrist every day?&nbsp; I think I've made my point, so let's move on.  Now, how about pieces of clothing that have integral parts missing?&nbsp; I.E., crotchless panties, bras with the nipple areas cut out, belly shirts, micro minis, and the whole lot?&nbsp; I wore some halfway revealing things in my time, but nothing compared to this stuff.&nbsp; It's like nobody has any imagination anymore - "Please don't cover that up because we can't visualize it unless we actually see it..."&nbsp; It's the element of mystery that I would think is sexy...that's what I like, anyway.&nbsp; Whether you're straight, gay, bi, dodecasexual, you would think it would be the same...what fun is it to undress someone in your head if they're already halfway there?&nbsp; That's like your mom handing you a halfway unwrapped Christmas present to save you the trouble.&nbsp;   Finally (because I'm running out of time, but I WILL continue this), what's up with this "madonna/whore" complex that still runs rampant in this enlightened age?&nbsp; I mean, don't mix the genres.&nbsp; If a woman is to look professional&nbsp;to turn you on, don't mix it with fishnet hose, stilettos, and something crotchless/nipple-less/otherwise not complete.&nbsp; I can't control what turns someone on, I realize, but come on, people!&nbsp; How many investment bankers do YOU know that wear a micro-mini and red fishnets?&nbsp; It's not practical, and highly frowned upon with the FDIC, I'm sure it is.  I'm sure I opened up a whole can of worms, but that's what this is all about, right?&nbsp; Comments are welcome, but no death threats, please.&nbsp; I've been through enough in my 35 years, it wouldn't be fun to threaten me...unless you do so with fishnet stockings and stiletto heels.

      You all must think I'm pathetic, and do I do anything but BLOG all day?&nbsp; The fact is, yes, I do.&nbsp; I'm not telling you what, but I do.&nbsp; :-)  Anyway, a final few words for Tuesday, huh?&nbsp; Boy, I've really put myself to the test.  I guess my final words are these:&nbsp; No matter what you do in life, it's not worth beans if you don't love someone/something too.&nbsp; If you have a special person/entity in your life, even if it's your cat, dog, hamster, aloe vera plant, whatever...don't be afraid to reach out, even if you've been hurt before.&nbsp;   Have a great day...

      OK...  I realize I'm being a bit narcissistic to think that folks care about my life, but I'm just going to wing it and think they do anyway.  I was born a small black child...wait, that's not right...  (stole that from Steve Martin...sorry Steve)  I was born on February 9, 1969.&nbsp; My sister wanted a pony...and my family wonders why I'm in therapy.&nbsp; Anyway, I grew up in a small town in Iowa (Washington).&nbsp; I was (still am in many respects) a nerd...thick glasses, braces (until 13), overweight, the whole nine yards.&nbsp; I managed to get along to a degree,&nbsp; but not without the usual angst.&nbsp;   Some small things from childhood stand out...I remember the very first time I ever saw Stevie Wonder.&nbsp; It was on "Sesame Street", and he was playing "Superstition" with his band.&nbsp; My mother walked in when she heard the music and saw me staring, mesmerized, at the screen and the musician reflected in it.&nbsp; "Who is that?" she asked.&nbsp; "Stevie&nbsp;Wonder, Mom," I replied, never once taking my eyes off the screen .&nbsp; My fascination with him has never wavered...many others have come and gone by the wayside, but Stevie has remained.&nbsp;   I also remember jumping off of a footbridge in Sunset Park because a girl I was in day camp with told me it wouldn't hurt.&nbsp; As I told the doctor later, "she lied".&nbsp; I sprained my ankle andmessed up my glasses but good ...I was six years old and so was she.&nbsp; I think she married a lawyer a few years back.&nbsp; Good thing, if she's still telling people to jump off bridges and that it won't hurt.&nbsp; Oh well...  Well, you'll just have to wait for the next installment...until then, I remain,  Sudiegirl

      New addition -- Kim Possible as VP (not sure who she'd support, but she kicks a**)  Also, Wonder Woman to run on the "good looks" ticket with Roger "Race" Bannon, but again, there's that whole Dr. Quest thing.&nbsp;   Thanks to my good friend, Kandace S., for supplying these ideas...CHICKS RULE!  Any other ideas out there?&nbsp; Spongebob Squarepants is too obvious, unless you can provide an argument.  A Bientot...  Sudiegirl

      I normally don't get political, but what the heck, I started with my own list of potential cartoon characters as candidates (and I'd like to add Yosemite Sam to the list as VP if we are going to go on with the whole swearing thing...Fudd and Sam on the same ticket...could be worthwhile!)  Teresa Heinz Kerry did something that I've always wanted to do...tell a total stranger that was pissing me off to shove it.&nbsp; I think I'm stating the obvious that I'm speaking for lots of people that feel the same...however, would us everyday Janes be able to get away with it in real life?&nbsp; I mean, she's an HEIRESS, first and foremost, and therefore has the cushion of cash to say what she wants, when she wants, to whomever she darn well pleases.&nbsp; I'm not saying the "shove it" was not deserved by reporters, but you know if I said it to someone (at the doctor's office, at the bank, whatever) and others would be within hearing distance, I'd be classified as a "mouthy broad".&nbsp; Not a badge of honor for everyone, although I'd be OK with it.&nbsp;   I guess the bigger picture here is where it's going to end...if she's the First Lady, she can't tell everyone she wants to "shove it", or even "Your mother wears army boots."&nbsp; Well, maybe can't isn't the word...more like shouldn't.&nbsp; Hillary Rodham Clinton isn't my favorite person in the world--she's OK, but reminds me of a girl I went to high school with who was an overachiever to the utmost maximum--but she always carried herself with taste and tact.&nbsp; I never heard her tell anyone to shove it, no matter how badly she wanted to (especially with Monicagate).&nbsp; I am the worst example of how to be "ladylike", but there are certain times when "shove it" is definitely appropriate, but other times when it's not.&nbsp; I don't know why I'm even concerned about it, but I guess it's just like Cheney telling somebody to go "f*** themselves".&nbsp; You know, when you're conducting business, that just ain't done no matter how good it makes you feel afterwards.&nbsp; But what do I know?&nbsp; I'm just a chick, musing...  Till later, then...  Sudiegirl

      I am not happy with the current Presidential candidates out there, so I'm going to push for write-in votes of my own.  Potential candidates?&nbsp; Well, sit down...I've got a few.  *Elmer Fudd...he's stupid and easily manipulated...perfectly Republican, could give GWB a run for his money.  *Bullwinkle J. Moose...I designed a presidential campaign for him in my rhetoric class at Iowa.&nbsp; He is a very well-rounded character, really - besides fighting the good fight against Boris, Natasha and Fearless Leader, he treasures knowledge and enjoys interpreting children's literature in his own unique way.&nbsp; Plus, Rocky would be a great VP - he smiles just as cutely as Edwards does.  *Roger "Race" Bannon - doesn't take any crap off anyone, nice big chest, white hair (very dignified) and, well, MANLY - unless you think about that close friendship with Dr. Quest (which I try not to as a rule).  OK, I've said my piece...what do you think?&nbsp; Write to me...I'm bored!  Sudiegirl

        Comedians like Lenny Bruce, George Carlin...they tell it like it is, and they show us that "antics with semantics" happen every day, and we're just as guilty as the next guy/gal.  Comedians like Bob Golthwait and Carrot Top, because they have no qualms about acting the way they do to get laughs. Carrot Top, especially...he needs a good conditioner, but he's really hilarious.  Marvin Gaye...besides the fact that his music wants to make me screw like a mink, he was a superb musician, singer, and lyricist. He had a tragic life, to be sure, but he could sing and make you forget your cares.  Naps...'nuff said  Pens...I love pens. Most any kind...gel, ball point, roller ball, fountain, calligraphy, felt tip. I have always loved pens, but now more than ever.  Adam Sandler...he is REALLY funny! That's it, end of story. He's an attractive man who isn't afraid to act stupid.  Coen brothers movies...the dialogue is so funny and lightning quick, it's unreal. I have yet to see "The Ladykillers", but the line I've heard from it, "Waffles! We must have waffles forthwith!" is really classic.  My friends. The ones I have now accept me for who I am, and we're all mature enough to let it all "hang out", as it were. We're gray, fat, divorced (some multiple times), and life hasn't worked out the way we thought it would, but we're still happy. We abhor the ones whose lives have gone strictly according to plan, because we're certain that "Made in Taiwan" is tattooed on their ass.  My family (some of them, anyway)...the ones that have bonded together in the last few years are my pride and joy. We've gone through hell and back, and life with them is good.  My nieces and nephew...they keep me young, and I love them more than my own life. They mean everything to me, and their humor and outlook keeps me in stitches.   Anyone care to comment? Please do...

        This is from my friend Gerry  G., a member of Swing Time Big Band and all around good guy...he sent this to me via e-mail today, and though it's not original, it's damn funny.  Read on...signed, Sudiegirl     Just watched a show on Canadian TV. There was a black comedian who said he misses Bill Clinton....  "Yep, that's right - I miss Bill Clinton! He was the closest thing we ever got to having a black man as President.   Number 1 - He played the sax.  Number 2 - He smoked weed.  Number 3 - He had his way with ugly fat white women.  Even now? look at him... his wife works, and he don't!    And, he gets a check from the government every month.   Manufacturers announced today that they will be stocking America's shelves this week with "Clinton Soup," in honor of one of the nations' most distinguished men. It consists primarily of a weenie in hot water.  Chrysler Corporation is adding a new car to its line to honor Bill Clinton. The Dodge Drafter will be in production in Canada this year.  When asked what he thought about foreign affairs, Clinton replied, "I don't know, I never had one."  American Indians nicknamed Bill Clinton "Walking Eagle" because he is so full of crap he can't fly.  Clinton lacked only three things to become one of America's finest leaders: integrity, vision, and wisdom.  Clinton will be recorded in history as the only President to do Hanky Panky between the Bushes.

      My friend Denise has  a daughter who has recently been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  We talk about it every once in a while.  She recounts the latest tale of woe (Chris is in a foster home, Chris has threatened Denise's life, Chris broke into Denise's house and stole money).  All I can do is say "I'm sorry" and say that this is all part of the disease and it never affects two people in the same way.  I feel like that explanation is a copout, but it's all I can give.   I've never (that I remember) threatened anyone's life while in a manic upswing.  The majority of the harm I've done is to myself, and anyone else who's suffered is because of the crossfire effect.   My parents and sister can testify to that.   One of the hardest things I've had to go through since being diagnosed is having these "moments of clarity", not unlike an alcoholic's, where I remember an event objectively instead of subjectively.  It's weird...it's like I'm watching the events as they're occuring in a terrarium or a snowglobe.  Little miniature versions of me and the other parties involved, and I'm watching myself and going, "Now why in the hell did I do that?  I only made it harder for myself.  Oh yeah...I was undiagnosed back then...DUH!"  (Not exactly the most politically correct approach, but hey, it's my psyche, not yours.)  Denise said that Chris had these moments of clarity before the last big meltdown, and Chris was scared to death.  No wonder.  Confronting yourself is the biggest scare tactic of all.  I hate doing it, especially when I'm currently between therapists (as I am now).   When I lived in Iowa, and my parents were closer by, my mother was especially afraid when I confronted things in my therapy.  I don't know if it was a fear for me, a fear for herself (that she should have done more, etc)., but when you're bipolar,  your focus is very narrow.   For better or worse, when you're bipolar, it's all about you...whether you're getting off on the chaos, you want the chaos to stop, you HAVE to have $200 worth of office supplies (or you HAVE to buy expensive gifts for others), you buy a car when you have no money to pay for it...and other people are just incidental.  When you're in between spells, you look around at the rubble you've created and go, "What the hell happened?"   Then it all comes back, and you get depressed.   It's like living in a hamster wheel.  I have no advice for how to deal with this...just hang on tight, and know that anyone who knows about your situation and wants to help are going to be in for the long haul.  Let them be there for as long as they can...you'll thank them for it later.  Sudiegirl

       1.  In the July '04 issue of   Georgia Outdoor News   magazine, they have a feature article on Michael Hubbard.  Michael Hubbard is a deer hunter.    Michael Hubbard is also BLIND.  As the song from "Sesame Street" goes (paraphrased):  "One of these things just doesn't belong here. "  OK, I've already talked about how I don't get the whole "hunting animals as a pleasurable activity" thing, but a BLIND HUNTER?  You think Stevie Wonder takes out his Winchester 30.06 and goes out for some moose?  I don't think so.    Oh, it's not like Mr. Hubbard goes out by himself and feels his way through the forest, and when something feels like Bambi, he shoots it.  NO...he has friends that help him aim his gun, and he pulls the trigger.    My God.  I don't have friends like this...maybe guy friends are different than girl friends.  If I was blind and wanted to hunt, none of my girl friends would take me.  I can't think of a single girlfriend of mine who would logically approve of such an activity.  Now my guy friends, on the other hand...they're game to try anything once, especially if I would provide beer and nachos, and had a classic rock station playing Lynyrd Skynrd's "Free Bird".    Also, what if he has a practical joker/psychopath of a friend, who aims the gun at something other than a deer, like his ex-wife?  "Yeah, that's a six-point floozy in season there...hold 'er steady, Mike, we don't want the pitcher to be all blurry-like."  For those of you who don't believe me, the website is  urlLink www.gon.com , and the article is entitled "Hunting Through Other's Eyes" (yes, the misuse of the apostrophe is there too).  Remind me to NEVER go to Georgia during hunting season.  2.  Mike Wallace (from "60 Minutes") gets mouthy and is issued a summons.  My God...Wallace got pissy (and at 86 years old, he's got experience, I'll tell ya that) because two inspectors were questioning his driver b/c they thought he was double parked.  He even "interfered with the investigation", but no details were given about that.  I'd love to know how he interfered...did he poke them soundly in the chest with his index finger?  Did he say, "Your mother blows bubble gum"?  Did he flash 'em (although, at 86, there may be nothing left to flash except broken dreams)?  I think this is important information that everyone needs to know.  OK, Mike...get a grip.  You're 86.  Surely you know how to play the system by now!  Get a "handicapped" sign or sticker for your car if you have a mobility problem...otherwise, just let 'em do their job.  Do you have something to hide?  You'd ask a victim - excuse  me, interview subject - the same question if they evaded your questions and interfered with your journalistic process.  Man, just go to court and deal with it.  It might help to go in with a walker, forget your name a few times, tell the judge he looks like Kate Smith, ask when the next bus trip to the casino is, stuff like that.  It couldn't hurt.  I do it every day!  :-)  Well, until there's more stuff I don't understand, I remain,  Sudiegirl

Here it is...stbb.aexx.net...copy and paste it into your browser, and you should be in like Flynn.  Well, what's going on with Sudiegirl?  Not a hell of a lot, actually, other than feeling the aftermath of my night of jitterbugging in my ankles and knees.  I'm gettin' old, y'all...still charming, but old all the same.   Not much going on for the week either, to be brutally honest.   I will update as time and inspiration allows...until then, ask yourself this question...WHO put the bomp in the bomp-ba-bomp-ba-bomp?

      Well, it went like this, kind of...  Saturday was kind of a bust...D and I went to a party that he was invited to by one of the guys from his Barbershop choir. (I should have taken that as a sign, but the last Barbershop party was really good...esp. the wine...ANYWAY) This was a general music "jam" get-together called "Music On the Back Porch". Well, first of all, the host of the party (self-satisfied M.F. in my opinion) was organizing a barbershop quartet to sing, and totally blew Doug and a couple of other leads off for this one guy who sounded like all his voice came out of this nose. I was not impressed. Anyway, we survived him being the lead of this impromptu quartet.  Then, the guy comes back again with...an accordion.  Yes, you read it right.  I would never have gone willingly to a party with an ACCORDION present, you KNOW this about me...so the nasal singer starts his portion of the show with...a hymn. Not just any old happy hymn, NO..."It Is Well With My Soul" which I have always associated with being in the direst pits of Hell and as a song of hope, not a song to sing at a PARTY!!!! Anyway, he sang all the verses, and he tried to do this suspended chord at the end (something I don't think an accordion was manufactured to do) and it sounded like a cat being run through a lawnmower backwards.  SO, you think it can't get any worse? WRONG! The next number he pulls out of his ass is from 1928, and it's a lovely little racist song called "Nagasaki" about how all the men chew tobacco and all the women are prostitutes. The chorus goes, "Back in Nagasaki where the men all chew tobaccy and the women wicky wacky woo..." I have never wicky wacky woo'd in my life and I doubt anyone in Japan had either. We could only sit through the first verse, and then we left promptly. So that was Saturday...  Yesterday was the wedding dance in Arlington at the Army Navy County Club. I sang with the Swing Time Big Band (web address= urlLink stbb.aexx.net )  That went well, and was a fun time to boot because the crowd was a really lively one.  I'm sorry, but I did happen to notice a good looking gentleman from Costa Rica with a nice rear because he would come out for all the Latin dance numbers and...let's just say I had to go get some fresh air. His ass was like two nice round softballs...the piano player asked if they were slow or fast pitch, and I told him "Slow" with a nice grin on my face. Anyway, I did harass Mr. Nice Hiney a little bit musically, but I also got to dance with him. Oh my. My heart was all a-flutter, and I even had to have a cigarette. Before he left, he sidled up to me and said, "I don't have to leave right away, you know..." but his wife was next to him and I said, "Yeah, you do...go home and have fun." Besides, as they say, "why settle for a hamburger when you have steak at home?"  Most everyone there had a sense of rhythm, which is really unusual for white people. I danced with a few other gents (some older, some younger and not too bad looking at all...sigh...) and thoroughly enjoyed myself. I love D., but I don't know what it is about me...all the important men in my life don't dance. Why is that? AAAGGGHHH! My dad is the only important man in my life that dances, I think...  We got paid too as well as fed, so all in all it was a successful evening. I rode home with the bass player and we caught up on what we've each been up to this summer, so life is good.  I will try to insert interesting things as well as my own original views on life...write back and tell me if I'm full of it or not.  Love to all, Sudiegirl

      I have to comment on your subject of "fishnet stockings" and "stiletto heels", Another editorial comment, this one from Steve B., who is evangelical in his belief of stilettos and stockings...    First, that looks sooooooo sexy.. I cant even tell you how quickly I want to make your world spin!!!       The heels give me something to hold on.      The fishnet stocking, (especially the ones with the line running up the back) make the whole package that much more sexy.       Any stockings, not just fishnet are so much on a chick, from a guys perspective, I like to follow up the inner thigh, and kiss as I feel the stocking rub up against my cheeks and teased by the heels across my back.       I am sure I can make a believer out of you ;)      Sorry, Steve, try as you might, stiletto heels and fishnets aren't making it with me, although if I don't have to walk in them, that does improve their stance somewhat.  Too many sprained ankles and foot problems tend to skew my opinions, I'm sorry to say.  However, you are nice to Kandace S., so that helps me to respect your opinion.  BTW, if you are reading this and it makes you angry, I'm sorry...but all opinions are important, even if I don't agree with them.  Will write some more original stuff later...

      Thanks to Zee W-H. for sending this to me...thought I'd share with y'all.   I'll write something original again some day, I promise.  Just getting so many funny things I have to share.  Thoughts on Society's Beloved:  John Kerry: www.johnkerryisadouchebagbutimvotingforhimanyway.com  Theresa Heinz Kerry:  Still hung up on her dead husband and seems to have become bat shit crazy since his passing, doesn't know her current husband because she's "only been married to him for 9 years," and needs to shut the hell up and get back in the kitchen.  Advice to her current husband: "Control your woman and never let her speak publicly you Tard!"  George W. Bush: hmph.  Joan Rivers:  Here's my theory: She has laces on the back of her head like a football. When she's due for another face lift, her surgeon unties the laces, puts his foot on the back of her head and pulls back her skin for that uplifting, skin tightening effect.  You could also make a nice wallet out of her.  Boy George:  I had a dream that I was a dude and I was being chased by Boy George and I had lost my pants.  Robert Smith (of the Cure):  That man does amazing things to red lipstick.  Jeff Smith: Our favorite chef from the Frugal Gourmet who disappeared from public television several years before he passed due to a bit of a scandal.  May he rest in peace and be in a better place where he would be more accepted among luscious luscious little boys.  Marc Summers:  The beloved host of Nickelodeon's Dare and Double Dare who suffers from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder but always wore white sneakers on the show as young children covered in slime ran around him.  Michael Jackson:  Obviously misunderstood (freak), should be the poster boy for anti-plastic surgery ads and his surgeon should lose his license and be gassed.  Mark Geragos:  First lawyer hired by Jackson to defend him against the charges he is currently facing who is now defending Scott Peterson.  He seems to take clients too guilty for Johnny Cochran.  John Basedow:  Probably making millions as a midget with enormous man breasts.  Oprah:  Too much money and probably eats babies.  Ike Turner:  He really does love you Tina baby.  Madonna: Media Whore  Britney Spears: Spear Britney.  She'd probably make a nice bag too.  Jean Reno:  The greatest, most badass, most hardcore dude EV-ER!  The best thing out of France since....hmm...yeah.  Steven Hawkins:  Needs to narrate my life.  Kmart Sucks.

      Yet another article from Yahoo - Oddly Enough  New Vatican Office to Put Soul Back Into Sports Wed Aug 4, 9:43 AM ET By Philip Pullella VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Bless me Father, for I have committed a foul in the penalty area.  urlLink   The Vatican, long in the business of souls, is now getting into the business of sports. Or more precisely, it is getting into the business of putting the soul back into sports. The Vatican has set up a department whose stated aim is to help re-inject fundamental values of fairness, ethics, transparency and legality into sports.  Neatly coinciding with next week's opening of the Olympic Games in Athens, the department, called Church and Sport, has been opened as part of the Vatican's Pontifical Council for Laity. "Every time you pick up the paper you see how urgent it is to promote ethics in sports," said Father Kevin Lixey, the head of the department, whose establishment was announced Tuesday. "Sports involves every single person. People talk about it in the coffee bars, on the buses, kids practice it," Lixey told Reuters in a telephone interview.  "The Church has to be a part of this world," he said.  A statement announcing the new department said this month's Olympics in Athens are "another clear sign of how much sport has become an important element in the life of our societies." It said the department had become necessary because many tendencies in sport had distanced people from its original ideals.  Since sport had become "one of the nerve centers of contemporary culture" the statement said the 1 billion member Roman Catholic Church should see the world of sports as a fertile ground to spread its evangelical message.  The new department would draw attention to Pope John Paul's speeches and writings on ethics in sports and propose studies on various aspects, including doping, violence and excessive commercialism.  The 84-year-old Pope was an avid sportsman in his youth and he has slowed down only in the last decade because of Parkinson's disease and arthritis. The new department would also promote the church's vision of sport as a means to promote "the integral growth of the person and as an instrument in the service of peace and fraternity among people."  The Pope, who encouraged the establishment of the department, is no stranger to that. As a teen-ager in his hometown of Wadowice, Poland, in the 1930s, he played for the high school's Jewish soccer team when they were short of players. And, if he ever did commit any fouls in the penalty area, one could safely assume he has since been forgiven.    Sudiegirl's opinion?    You know, this headline is hilarious...totally disappointing to read the story.  I thought it would be the Pope inviting Bootsy Collins and Rick James to the Vatican to jam.  "She's a super-freak, super-freak, she's super freaky..."

      This is an actual news item from Yahoo/Reuters...check it out.   We All Scream for Ice Cream 44 minutes ago  OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - An Oklahoma ice cream man opened fire on a customer after a summer ice cream sale turned sour, police said on Tuesday.  Police in Enid, about 75 miles north of Oklahoma City, said they arrested Markus Miller, 29, an ice cream truck driver for Summer Song, on Sunday on two misdemeanor charges as well as a felony charge of pointing a firearm. If convicted, Miller could receive up to 10 years in jail on the felony charge. According to police, an 18-year-old woman approached Miller's ice cream truck and the conversation degenerated into a heated argument. Miller is suspected of taking out a pistol and firing two shots at the feet of the woman. She was struck on the collarbone-area by either a bullet fragment or debris from the shots, police said. Miller was arrested in his ice cream truck a short distance from the incident and police recovered a hand gun from the vehicle, they said. "It is not a normal or legal thing, anywhere in the country to carry a handgun without a permit while selling ice cream," said Sgt. Eric Holtzclaw, a spokesman with the Enid Police Department.   Sudiegirl's opinion?   Glad to know that in OK, it is not a normal or legal thing to have a handgun while selling ice cream.  What about buying it?  Can you imagine Dirty Harry buying ice cream and not getting sprinkles?  "Go ahead, make my sundae."  I know, bad pun...but think about it...Clint Eastwood pulling out a Smith and Wesson, saying "I wanted Fudge Ripple!"

      Brian W. brought up a good point...how in the world did I get the nickname "Sudie"?  It's a Dawson thing (as in my family...sometimes I was "Susie". mostly, though, I was "Sudie". )The girl part I added for the BLOG to make it distinctive, as if I need it...  What other nicknames have I had through the years?  Well, besides the mean ones ("Su-eee", "Sewer", "Su-eee, ewwy, gooey with chocolate", "bitch", etc.), I have had some fun ones.  Including:    "Sueford" - courtesy of my friend back in IA,  Brenda W...she just started calling me Sueford one day, so when I call her now, I just tell her husband Sueford's on the phone.  "Sheena" - short for "Sheena, Queen of the Jungle".  I started calling myself that in high school, and I'm not sure why, but all the musicheads I hung around with seemed to take to it OK.  As a matter of fact, Kandace S. still calls me that to this very day, and I call her "Circe" because of the spell she casts over my boyfriend Doug.  He thinks she's cute.  It's funny, really, and I'm not offended by it at all...it gives Kandace and I more ideas of how to mess with his mind.  (haha just kidding, Doug...)  Quack  Quack - this is a long one, so hold on to your hats...my oldest niece, Courtney K., had a speech impediment when a toddler and kind of made up her own language.  You had to be family to really understand it.  Anyway, most women were grouped into "zaggies" (young teens) or "mommies" (women her mom's age and up).  Not me...I was Quack-Quack.  Nobody knows why she picked it...not even Courtney.  It was something special between she and I, and when she finally was able to say my name, it made me kind of sad b/c the special nickname was gone.  She calls me Quack Quack now and again, and I sign my name "Quack Quack" sometimes when I write to her.  I'll always be her favorite duck.   Well, that's all the exposure you get for today...until the next time I'm inspired, I remain...  Sudiegirl

      A response to the whole chicks on chicks thing...courtesy of Brian W., my best friend from college, and one of the best writers I know (plus, check out the ringing endorsement he gave to the Sudiegirl! I'm all a-flutter...read on)     Well, to reply to some of your blog stuff,  which I find funny and very well written , I think women wearing almost any type of high heels is pretty ridiculous. They don't look comfortable, and they don't add any shape to one's legs if you don't have shapely legs to begin with any way. Actually, what I really dislike on women are those low rider jeans that keep on falling down to one's butt crack. Are these women having a problem finding jeans that fit? If you want to show off your crack, then you might as well just walk around half naked. This is not turn on but a silly, slutty distraction. However, girl on girl action "can" be a turn on. It depends. I sometimes find it so only because it sometimes seems that two girls are being satisfied better than when some guy is just ramming it into them. I have often found lesbo action to be more passionately erotic than some guy shooting his wad onto some girl. (By the way, I don't find gangbanging, S &amp; M, or bondage to be a turn on.)     Well, Brian, thanks for your editorial comment...forgot to comment on low rider jeans myself, but he did it much more eloquently than I ever could.  Any more comments out there? Come on, all you enlightened men...one little girl like me can't possibly scare you!  Sudiegirl

      Hot in the DC area today, and humid.  Yuk.  Not much going on here, really...family's good, work is good, can't complain today...but there's always tomorrow.  Here's some nice quotes re: kissing that I think you all will enjoy...    A kiss is something you cannot give without taking and cannottake without giving.~ Anonymous-  Kiss till the cow comes home.~ Francis Beaumont  What of soul was left, I wonder, when the kissing had to stop?~ Robert Browning  We turned on one another deep, drowned gazes, and exchanged a kiss that reduced my bones to rubber and my brain to gruel.~ Peter De   Vriesa peach is a peach a plum is a plum a kiss ain't a kiss without some tongue... so open up your mouth and close your eyes and give your tongue some exercise...~ Diesel  kisses are a better fate than wisdom. ~ e. e. cummings   A kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature to stop speech when words become superfluous.~ Ingrid Bergman  It is the passion that is in a kiss that gives to it its sweetness; it is the affection in a kiss that sanctifies it.~ Christian Nestell Bovee  Kiss me as if you made believe You were not sure this eve, How my face, your flower, had pursed It's petals up ...~ Robert Browning  You should not take a fellow eight years old and make him swear to never kiss the girls.~ Robert Browning  The moment eternal - just that and no more -When ecstasy's utmost we clutch at the core While cheeks burn, arms open, eyes shut, and lips meet!~ Robert Browning   First time he kissed me, he but only kissed The fingers of this hand wherewith I write;And, ever since, it grew more clean and white.~ Elizabeth Barrett Browning  If you are ever in doubt as to whether or not you should kiss a pretty girl, always give her the benefit of a doubt.~ Thomas Carlyle  ...then I did the simplest thing in the world.  I leaned down... and kissed him.  And the world cracked open.~ Agnes de Mille  One kind kiss before we part, Drop a tear and bid adieu; Though we sever, my fond heart Till we meet shall pant for you.~ Robert Dodsley  That farewell kiss which resembles greeting,that last glance of love which becomes the sharpest pang of sorrow.~ George Eliot [Mary Ann Evans] -  Is not a kiss the very autograph of love?~ Henry Finck   There is the kiss of welcome and of parting, the long, lingering, loving, present one; the stolen, or the mutual one;the kiss of love, of joy, and of sorrow;the seal of promise and receipt of fulfillment.~ Thomas C. Haliburotn (1796-1865)  Never a lip is curved with pain That can't be kissed into smile again.~ Brete Harte  You may conquer with the sword,but you are conquered by a kiss.~ Daniel Heinsius (1580-1655)-  I kissed her hard and held her tight and tried to open her lips; they were closed tight.~ Ernest Hemingway  Give me a kiss, add to that kiss a score;Then to that twenty, add a hundred more:A thousand to that hundred: so kiss on,To make that thousand up a million.  Treble that million, and when that is done, Let's kiss afresh, as when we first begun.~ Robert Herrick (this one is my fave, BTW)  I dare not ask a kiss;I dare not beg a smile;Lest having that or this,I might grow proud the while.No, no, the utmost shareOf my desire shall be Only to kiss that air,That lately kissed thee.~ Robert Herrick  You must remember this, a kiss is just a kiss...~ Herman Hupfeld   Keep kissin',  Sudiegirl

      You all may think "Why is Ms. Sudiegirl sharing her ignorance with us? Doesn't she have an image to uphold?"  Nope, sure don't.  You see, in order to have an image, you have to exude some kind of mystique, which I think is kind of an exotic BO or something like that. At any rate, my BO doesn't smell in the least exotic (funky, maybe, but not exotic), therefore no mystique and no image.  So here we go, campers, onward, with "Things I Don't Get" (first in a series...Kandace S. has once again helped contribute thanks to our daily e-mail missives to each other, and other folks have contributed too...if I don't get your name inserted in here, come to my house and beat me up and I'll be sure to give you credit the next time!)  Insert your own fanfare here (I dig Aaron Copland's "Fanfare for the Common Man" myself):   OK, the first thing I don't get... HUNTING an animal and killing it . Don't get me wrong, here...this is not an anti-gun rant or some extreme PETA thing. I understand the scientific principles of thinning out the populations of various animals so they don't kill each other off due to over-population, and I'm cool with that. I did pay attention a little bit in biology, and understand that Mother Nature doesn't always get the thinning-out part done on her own. However, in this day and age of farming, mass production and whatnot (Pilgrim's Pride and the redneck sport of "chicken football" notwithstanding), do we really need to go out like Davy Crockett and shoot moose, bear, and other critters? I mean, I guess I could understand the thrill of the hunt if it was like, say, a plus-size clothing sale at Kohl's or Dress Barn. Now THAT's thrilling...going in and trying to find a pair of navy blue slacks on sale days like that is akin to opening day of pheasant season, I'm sure. However, I don't have to pluck the pants when I'm done, there's no blood (unless someone gets in my way), I don't have to have a license to go to the sale (I can take the bus or catch a ride with a fellow enthusiast), and even if I have a criminal record, I can still shop (provided I pay for my purchases, that is). Sounds girly, I know, but that's the kind of hunt I feel is most worthwhile, especially if it's 50% off or more. (Thanks to Mike F. for discussing this issue with me on a Friday night at 10 PM)  Why are many men turned on by two women getting intimate with each other? Kandace S. and I have been discussing this and we don't have an answer for that one yet. Nobody ever discusses whether women like watching two men smooch and do whatever to each other...I'm pretty indifferent to it, myself. As Robin Williams says, "It's like watching an industrial film in fur." If any men could actually explain this (the allure of chick-on-chick action) to me, I would sleep a little better at night...well, that would be a contributing factor, anyway. Still have to have a fifth of tequila to really get the job done.  OK, time for Sudie to rant on Hollywood for a few. We've all seen poor Mary-Kate Olsen do the rehab thing for anorexia, and we've seen the footage of Kirstie Alley discussing her comfort with her current physical look (which, by the way, I'm fine with...she's one of my heroes). What is the big f*****g deal with weight and physical image in Hollyweird? Our country is so messed up as it is, and we have to deal with this? I mean, the press treats Kirstie like a trailblazer of sorts, and she is. Why? Because she doesn't give a damn about what they say...she loves her children and she isn't going to worry to extremes about her body image because she's aware of who she is in the first place. She defines herself, I guess, and I admire her for it. As a plus-sized babe myself, I know there are a hell of a lot more of us out there than the celery-sucking Hollywood mamas, and they'd better watch out. One day, we'll take over.   The last thing I don't get (for today, anyway) is how PETA can get angry with KFC for its meat processors playing chicken football, but they can make fun of various overweight celebrities (Luciano Pavarotti, for one). Aren't humans animals, too? If so, that treatment is not very ethical and I think we should go out and throw paint on all the PETA activists we know. Oh, and since Russell Simmons (hip-hop mogul and media activist)...since his wife, Kimora Lee Simmons, got busted for pot possession, that should be OK with PETA since marijuana is organic, right? So is cocaine and heroin, and most brands of consumable alcohol...the list goes on for days. Hey, maybe I'll join PETA after all, if their standards change...   Well, until next time, campers...  Sudiegirl
