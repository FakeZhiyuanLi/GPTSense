      I think I may be being too much, is calling you practically every day overdoing it? I don't do it because I feel that I have to. It's just that whenever I sit down near a phone I'm compelled to pick it up and ring you just so I can hear you and so that I know that you're there... but... sometimes I wonder whether you want to hear me. Admittedly I left when you called, felt like I was a bit rude then.. nehoo. Pidgeons are on the roof :S

      *Sighs contentedly* Funday, munchday. Huggles :) Ooooh Ooooh I can play Hallelujah, I was just singing it just now, to myself obviously since people wince when I sing infront of them :P hehehe stupid people. Munch can play the piano better than me I felt a bit bitter about that until I realised it was Munch so then I just felt proud... Quite why I felt proud I don't know. Oh yeah and I found out I'm faster than a squirrel cos I was gaining on it before it ran up the tree... that was on my way to buy some cheese. I've nothing to do tomorrow :( Well what I mean is I'm not seeing anybody tomorrow which sucks :( But I'm getting some new shoes, which is fun :) Anyhoo I'm going to play Hallelujah again... bet I've forgotten though... plus my piano suck's compared to the piano of Munch (Munchs Piano looked wrong)

      You know what get's to me? Being ignored, it makes me feel insignificant. Most times when I'm feeling insignificant I crawl into a hole and feel like dieing. Not when I'm being ignored, if I'm ignored I get angry, really fucking pissy. (Refrains from putting in bitchy comments/Cruel repertoire designed to cut and make some fucking(refrains) bleed). Raar. Annoyed.  Raar Raar

      You are like all the colours of the rainbow, from pink through to yellow... okay so rainbows aren't my forte either. Thank you your loverly. Your texts made me smile and laugh which was impressive considering that I was near screaming at miscomprehension of Psychology. Huggles Munch. You of course don't understand how sorry I was that I couldn't come round today, I know you don't believe me but I do feel bad when I don't really bad, kinda like I hate myself so much so bad, bad. Yes. I'm so sleeeeepy but that's okay cos I've done TONNES of revision... can't remember half of it but I DON'T CARE! so hah... hah... he.. h.. oh. Sweet Nightmares... maybe I won't eat so much just before going to bed this time and I won't get traumatised.

      The worst thing about your world being turned upside-down is knowing that it's only upside-down because of your own irrepressible idiocies. These Idiocies which go on to hurt, annoy or irritate other people who you have no right to have such an effect upon. Masochism is a form of self pity with which for a while I was acquainted, however to a degree the declamations against society, myself and other people are also. I had a dream last night that I lost you, I didn't have you, and it hurt.

      Good Morning. Good Afternoon. Good Evening and Goodnight. Now why the hell aren't there any in between? Good morning lasts from 7 till 12. Afternoon from 12 till 6. Good Evening from 6 - 12. Goodnight... well depends on how kinky you feel. Now I believe that if it's just before 12 there should be something else you can say cos it pisses me off. Great Uncle Johnny and his wife are here, damn he's talkative I was speaking non stop for about 30 minutes all the while trying to be interested. Nah he's funky really. Oooh and Munki might have sorted out her love life. Invariably she won't have though. Philips trying to whip me with a  skipping rope :S Yay Nickelback on the 18th :) Good luck to everyone doing Pure Maths AS.

      Mmmm Munch. You make me so unbelievably happy, from the depressed boy to a teenager in love... I like it :) Love you. I had a lot of fun today even if there were mitigating restrictions on it, which weren't your fault xhxhx cuddles. Alexandra I must say you are a fool... I can't remember whether I used those lyrics or changed to less scathing ones but myeh :P

      Here it is  The situation: under 24 hours till my practical exam Feelings about exam: Not worried it's basically following instructions and knowing details of microscopic slides Feelings: Depressed, angry, irritated, tired.  As you can see a bit of a problem, I can't do the exam knackered can I? And I'm working tonight so I can't just goto bed early. I probably won't get anything to eat cos mum shouted at me about using "her food" in "her kitchen". So I'm going to collapse. But I had fun today with munch and that's all that counts

      I'm crying... I'm not really sure why, I feel really sad, but again I don't know why, I think I'll goto bed.  To everything I want to be And everything I cannot see A thousand worlds in a reflection A reflection of a thousand worlds  To the night moon and stars All has faded, my scars Long gone, hiding beneath faceted Gem's That douse me in sanctuary and will not let this part free  To the boy with blue eyes To be the part of you that never dies.  Harsh remittance from my eyes and mouth My soul is crying, bleeding, dying, We cannot let him out. An a epiphany of words, chase the day away And you know, One day I'll be gone but not today  Tearing the light from my eye And Screaming in darkness night sky I'll push all away my soul is here to stay To stay, I'm gonna push all away.  You know this isn't for you I told you what you cannot do I pushed you away Left reflecting in yest-ter-day.  Hmm well that was shit but it made me feel better, I sang it you see. To Isendre, Erise and Lucifer sweet dreams...

      It really pisses me off in English the way that Laura and Gough scorn everything that either myself or Ryan puts forward. Okay so compared to Ryan my points are minor or negligable I can understand that, and perhaps I lack the vocal eloquence to put it across but that doesn't stop me from holding an opinion which could be valid. Gemma's gone away to a wedding with some old biddies and she is texting me every hour or so. I don't mind, far from it, but I feel guilty cos I'm not texting back, it's not that I don't want to it's just that I'm low on credit as it is and I won't get any more till the 28th which is gay, but that's life. I'm trying to search for a song that I can listen to that isn't too upbeat, and isn't depressing and that I haven't heard a million times before... I'm probably gonna digress into Three Doors Down but I'm being happy because I know that's important to you, and if it's important to you then I will try my best. Puddles agreed that I was nice against Ryan... well actually she said that "Yeah, you're nice now" I don't really want to think what she means by now, I would be offended probably. Summer does weird things to me... or maybe that's the exams, I feel really tired and wound up... I reckon that's just school in general though so I don't know. "Oh we're half way there, living on a prayer, take my hand, we'll make it I swear". Mayflies keep ramming into the pavillion windows probably cos of the lights but damn they're huge, see I found out what they're called, they look like killer moth wasps to me but I'll call them Mayflies. Reflecting I'm just being pedantic I seem to obsess into melodrama and so if something goes wrong then my whole world comes crashing down... I'm too emotional, stupid things can get to me, but I try not to let them show to other people, mainly cos they're stupid and I know they shouldn't bother me... and yet it does. I'm really tired and to tell the truth I have no idea what hours I'm working tomorrow I was going to find out today but I never went in which means I'm going to have to go over early tomorrow morning to find out... which as you can imagine sucks pretty badly. Oh well, I've nobody to say sweet dreams to, or n'night, and nobody to tell me that it's alright, it's okay... and nobody to hug me... hmm melodrama. I'm tempted to xhx this but I'll leave it be. Goodnight to the void.

      Yeah so I'm listening to much Staind screw it I don't care. I feel lonely sitting here infront of my computer, listening to music about the unfairness of life and the world, and the continued degradation of society. I realised a while back that I need people to stay sane, without them I get confused and I become increasingly reclusive. The thing is I'm not entirely sure who my friends are anymore, everythings shifted and I've been left standing on air. Shez has become closer friends with Jo, John, Nick, Jade and company... He's heading towards Christianity I fear somewhat. Rebs, Gem and Fi have all departed and joined the company of the Upper Sixth and those are grounds I would enter with extreme trepidation. Jack, Matt, Dan and company have become a group unto themselves as have the CCF people who I would not count myself as among. The group which I'm technically closest to at the moment is Gemma's friends and their lovely but we're only friends cos of Gemma. The people I speak to during the day are Gemma, I have become my anti-christ the loner boyfriend.

      Forgive me I feel somewhat sad and so I must write again. So many thing's are confusing at the moment, that it's just unreal. Gemma is the only thing that's going right at the moment and that sounds ominously like melodrama but bite me. Of course the fact that Gemma is going right makes me think that something's "Gotta go wrong because I'm feeling way too damn good". I think that Alex makes her feel insecure just by existing albeit she doesn't understand. Alex was the ongoing love affair of my life, but she hurt me very badly. I don't think Alex understands how much she hurt me either on that note. I told her a while back that she broke my heart and she just laughed and said that we both just had to grow up a little but no I wished at the time that she would fall hopelessly in love with somebody who would cruelly lead her on and reject her. But no I'm getting side-tracked here, Alex was the love of my life, she isn't anymore. And no matter how hard I try to emphasise that point to Gemma she doesn't seem to believe me, she still wants to believe that I'll leave her for Alex. Oh yeah and it sometimes pisses me off that she point blank refuses to admit that she's attractive, but she doesn't know that which is good otherwise she'd get sad and I'd feel bad and get guilty and masochistic. I love Gemma, love her.

      If I was to surround myself in cushions would it hurt less when I hit the wall? Metaphorical of course since they're called padded cells, oh well that's where reflection seems to get me. A little lost and more than a bit dazed. How can you come in here, my sanctuary and tell me everything that I don't do right, turn-around tell me I'm fine and then say that I could be better. Don't you understand that you're just pushing me down? I don't want to be better I'm happy being me? Comprendez Vous? Okay so French isn't really my forte is it? The problem with when I think is that I always seem to end up asking myself more questions than those I started. "C'est la Vie" as Shez would say, "That's Life" as I argued.

      Hugs are fun and yummy it's like your surrounded by a warm bubble that's holding you up. I suppose that it's borne from being inside the womb when your surrounded by warmth and your on the brink of conscious existence and all you know is contentment. Since obviously there is an attempt to revert to a stage of comfort whilst maintaining a sense of dignity hugging occurs. In which both you and the person recieve comfort in the warmth of the other persons body and the support which they grant your body. I am ergonomically friendly :)

It was mucho fun   Sometimes it feels like I'm just trying to make the responses

      He lay dishevelled in the middle of the road, the rain and the wind gleaning from his body the last vestiges of warmth. Dampness seeped into him like the sordid depravations which his soul had experienced by knowing too much and caring too little. He wasn't another chapter in the story of life, most people credit no more than a sentence if that. The people who credit paragraphs are those to whom we credit minor atrocities and those who's names we do not name. Those who are credited with chapters are the true villains of history. It is more common for people to recall the worst things that have happened recently than the good things. When people are asked of the good things that have happened in their lives you usually find that none spring to mind and they are forced to say they are sure there was something but they cannot recall what. When on the other hand pressed to recall the worst things which have occured people are more than willing to divulge the worst parts of their lives. The root of existence comes from remembering the worst that has happened... isn't that the fundamental flaw of existence? Isn't questioning society which I follow and belong to, in its own way hypocritical and conceited of me?

      Sorry about being sulky today I was just being foolish. You were speaking about guys who you'd kissed and that made me feel insecure and more than a little jealous. That's why when you went in to talk to Fliss I stomped off cos I felt more than a bit abandoned. You say I don't tell you things when they bother me, but in writing them here I do because you do read this so you will know my problems. But by using this a mediatory body it's a lot easier, probably cos I don't know exactly when you'll read it. An apology to Steph to stealing you for today. Now I'm feeling a bit guilty about not going with Gemma to see her friends stupid shellfish moi. But Yay! Nickelback National Express Tickets are now bought and hence problemos are nil :) And I'm sure that there's more that I wanna say but I can't think of what else to say. Oooh I got attacked by aphids on the way home... hmmm maybe I should just publish the post... yes methinks I shall.

      You were very traumatised yesterday and all I wanted to do was to hold onto you and take away whatever was hurting you. This is obviously what I tried to do but I failed to do so and for that I'm sorry. Your apologies aren't required, you were traumatised and it's (forgive me for sounding quite so archaic) my honour to make you feel better but unless I find out the cause then there's only so much that I can do. So I'm sorry that I'm not diligent or trustworthy enough to solve your problems. Sorry.

      I'm having to wait till I get to part of the song I can recognise so I can make it the title allowing me to carry on in my foolish manner... *waits impatiently*. There we go. I ranted earlier I realise, actually I ranted last night cos I felt lonely and I feel somewhat symbolic so I'm gonna say it was like my soul curdling and congealing around my heart and I felt all cold inside. It was all because yesterday both me and Gem had an exam, and when I found her she was outside doing mechanics revision and she was obviously busy so I thought I'd get out of her way and said I was gonna go inside to which she decided to go and play frisbee. I hardly felt all that secure anyway my mum having just spent about 20 minutes attacking my job prospects and life ideals to their very core. But yes I sit there somewhat dejectedly chatting to Shez and she comes in and doesn't even look in my direction so I try very hard to gain her attention, most notably with a "Raar" I actually went "raar" twice but she was so avid in ignoring me that she only actually heard the second one despite walking practically infront of me and not even glancing in my direction, I was somewhat hurt. All I wanted was contact, you know I don't like not touching people I feel secure as though it's all real and that I've got something to hold onto. But yes I pull her down onto my lap and she tries to leave 3 times which affronted me more than I let on, I pretended to pout when she went over to Kathryn inside I was however cut to pieces and not feeling all that significant. You then left with nothing more than a desultory kiss, which made me feel all the more unwanted. The feeling manifested itself all the more through the day and by the time I got home all I did was go up to my room and curl up on my bed and cry, I felt so down and unwanted. In my attempt to explain my own ranting I've gone and ranted again. I feel very alone, and empty. Shez said it's cos I don't speak to anyone apart from Gemma and he's right. She says that she gets weird when she doesn't see people. I'm already weird but without her I'd have nothing and all that would be left would be to crawl into a hole and die, leaving not even a trace on this planet. The thing is that it's difficult to meet people cos I don't really do groups and if I do groups then I'll only feel safe if Gemma is there. If I do individuals then Gemma will get very insecure, especially if they're girls, so I try very very hard not to be in anyway suggestive, flirtatious or anything tangible. Of course this makes me very tedious company which kind of defeats the object of talking to people if they really don't want to talk to you. I hate being a pushover, I didn't want to work tonight.

      As the night steals away the last vestige of sunshine, a benign crescent moon sheds translucent light on the shuttered dreams of the lost and the lonely. Morning only seems to bring with it yesterdays regrets and tomorrows failures. This is what you call life, this is what looks like the future. A bleak dark sky which sole source of light has gone come the morning. Is this what we live for? Dreams we cannot fulfill because of what is expected to be above us or below us? In truth isn't the only thing above us the sky, the only thing below us the ground? The intervening space is ours to do with as we see fit as individuals on this planet. Whether the intervening space is an idol to past transgressions and failed hopes or a place of sanctuary from which we hide from what we cannot face. Everybody exerts pressure upon every other person. This pressure comes in many guises; love, hate, expectations and the million and one other things which compose our very existence. Is it not a wonder that all of us are not crushed by the pressure of life? Obviously there would have to be a logical way to explain this. People who are crushed do not fall into one of these two categories. Firstly, you have the subserviant, the bullied and oppressed who take these pressures as a halter around their necks which they must drag for the rest of their lives, merely to cultivate their worlds. They are alive and healthy, but are they happy? Doesn't their burden grow greater every day? Perhaps so. Perhaps at some point in their lives they relieve themselves of their burden and live unshackled by the past, perhaps not, perhaps all that is left to live in is the past after a certain point because your future holds nothing. The other group accept the pressures which the world exerts on them but they bend to them and filter only the ones that matter. They are the happy, they live only to fulfill their own expectations and their own goals. If people dont fall into these categories then they are hard. Hard but not strong, they draw themselves into themselves and become brittle. In their brittle state, they crack.

      Oooh that reminds me I'm having two Russian girls and a... erm... some other country girl all staying with us in July at the same time... hehe amusink. I wanna be able to sing it would make me so happy I could sing and make a band and it would be fun I wouldn't really care whether we did well, but I can't sing so that's that plan scuffed. Which leads me onto wondering what I want to do with my life, and the thing is that nothing really appeals for too long, I get bored too easily and I'm too lazy to stick at things which's a bit of a problem. I completely cocked up that Biology exam I'm definitely retaking the Transport Module and I may have to retake Human Health and Disease but that's on a maybe...  "How does one... Pancake?"

      I was thinking (bad sign). And I was thinking of the futility of... well basically life. We go to school we go to Sixth Form we go to Uni, we get a job we die. What's the point? Are you any happier earning £40k a year than you would be earning £10k? I don't think realistically you would. I'm gaining doubts and reservations about everything... I spoke to Charli last night which was a bit of the shock to say the least. The very fact that she called me was the most shocking, last time I had any acquaintance with her she absolutely abhorred me now she doesn't or so it would seem. She seems willing to accept my existence. I spoke to Alex as well briefly and she just plain confused me it was... abrupt. And I called Gemma and she didn't answer, so I left a message on her answering machine thingy, I'm making friends with that woman more and more recently. She seems somewhat distant... maybe that's just me. I'm bored and full, and listening to Keane. I don't want to do anything till Friday. Practically everybody at work called me yesterday to see if I'd work in place of them, oddily enough I said no. I miss you, I spent yesterday with you and now I want you here with me to hold on to. I can't stop thinking...

      You haven't gone yet but I'm missing you. I feel heavier and it feels like I'm being dragged down, I feel a bit dazed and more than a little lost. I have urges to pick up the phone and call you again just so that I can speak to you that little bit longer, but it's not going to help. It felt like I was saying goodnight and I was but when I say goodnight I always know that I'll be able to call you the next day or see you the next day, but this time, neither is possible so I feel a bit hopeless. I love you, and you're only gone for 5 days but I've never gone longer than 24 hours without some sort of contact with you so 5 days seems like an eternity to me. The worst thing is that if you hurt yourself, or cry, or get hurt by someone, there's nothing that I'll be able to do, and I won't know that anything's wrong and I think that's the worst thing, if you're hurting I have to know, and I won't be able to know.

      Had I deigned to write to you the day before yesterday or indeed the day before that my writing would have been needlessly foppish, foolish and lovestruck. That feeling is of course still there its that kind of light bulb inside of me which is reassuring me, that's both my love for you and your love for me. I really don't know what to do though, I feel like a complete and utter prick for being completely and utterly incapable of doing anything, to make this better. Sorry.

Last night you cried and cried and it hurt me because it was my fault and there was nothing I could possibly do to take it away from you when all I wanted was to make you happy. I'm sorry I understand that I couldn't possibly have said a worse thing to you and it hurt you. I think you want me to go, you're trying very hard to pretend that I'm not here anymore, but no matter how hard you try, I'm still going to be here because everything I told you last night was not drunken rambling. You are the only thing I've ever wanted so badly in my life and now that I have you, I refuse to let you go. If that's selfish then so be it, we've already discovered that I'm a selfish person and that my own desire for self-gratification comes above anything that anybody else could possibly be. But I love you, this hurts, I'm sorry.

      A man walks down the street  It's a street in a strange world  Maybe it's the Third World  Maybe it's his first time around  He doesn't speak the language  He holds no currency  He is a foreign man  He is surrounded by the sound  The sound  Cattle in the marketplace Scatterlings and orphanages  He looks around, around  He sees angels in the architecture  Spinning in infinity  He says Amen! and Hallelujah!  &nbsp; Hehe I love Paul Simon

      Don't smile for me, don't cry for me, don't feel guilty for me. I love you, if you're sad be sad I'll still love you, if you hurt the that's okay I'll still love you. I'm not going to stop loving you no matter how you feel. I love you. Simple.

      I feel empty. Surrounded by skin but there's not anything inside, feels like my mind has retreated to the back of my head and is watching with somewhat glazed eyes what is happening with the rest of the world. There's some stuff I wanted to say because I miss you. You said that you think I'm going to leave you, I suppose that means you think I'm ignoring you or not paying you any attention. Look at this from my perspective. When do I leave you? I leave you when you are completely ignoring me. You no longer seem to distinct between me being there and me not being there, except that if I'm not there then obviously you feel compelled to find me. I've been trying especially hard since the monday before last to pay as much attention as I physically can to you to see if you would do the same back. The amount of attention you paid me on my birthday was huge and you made it my best birthday ever, admittedly when I'm comparative to all my other birthdays that's not saying much but you made me enjoy my birthday which is something which I haven't done for a very long time. Now that my birthday has come and gone it's receding back into a lull. I pull you over to me when we're sitting down and you resist, your happier with me not touching you, in an attempt to get over this I know try as hard as I can to sit beside you so that I can hold you. But half the time I'm holding you it feels as though I'm some superfluous limpet and you don't even notice I'm there. I know you're insecure but I don't understand why are you so insecure. I've bee here for the past 6 months and I've not gone, I've never cheated on you and the truth is that I've never wanted to, that of course sounds like bullshit, but it's the truth and yes well raar. What I'm saying is how can I make you secure? I want you to sometimes come to me and hug me, take my hand, kiss me, maybe make the odd decision once in a while, this is not having a go and that is something you must recognise. I'm going to keep trying but it'll leave me feeling hollow and fake. This isn't related to the phone call we just had, this isn't something that's making me sad because it's the way you are and I may have to live with it but I just wanted to make you aware of things in response to your blog from my perspective. You will always be a part of me, there is a lyric that would work really well here so I'm gonna find it, then I'm going to go inside and you'll call in a bit, and I will try to explain that I just think everything is stupid, pointless and a complete waste of time. Whoever created existence had a sense of humour, and if it was some God figure then he was a masochist for creating us, if we were intended to worship him then he's pretty arrogant. Worship has nothing to do with good, evil, right or wrong, it's to do with power. If there was a God and he was good then he would have created equals because respect can be earned among equals, from superiors it is only demanded.  I love you with all my little heart, it's all the love I can give you and if it's not enough then forgive me, for I have nothing else to give. However... I do love you.  This was all written post-phonecall so don't tell me I was lieing that there was nothing useful on my blog.  Smile, I love you. I realise that is a demand but the way I mean it is that I hope the fact that I do love you, makes you smile. The fact that I know you love me makes me smile.

      Whenever I write poetry I write as though it were that I was travelling, making a journey, e.g.  I walk down the endlessly twining path, Its once sweet grasses wither and die. The bed of roses now a mass of black brambles, Which lunge to cut me with silken slashes. Behind me recede the once blue skies, Before me roll in the darkening clouds. The pavings beneath my feet crack and crumble, The broken rubble cuts my feet. The blighted decay around me, Replaced by sun blasted deserts. The remaining sickly pallor of sunlight, Replaced by impenetrable night. The darkness, my fog, blinds me. I stumble and fall through nothingness, Nothingness, falls and stumbles, Through me.  I'm not honestly sure what the point I'm trying to make is, I suppose it's just that I have nothing left to say and I have the urge to speak. I'm sure there was something I wanted to sort out but I've forgotten what it was. I think Aerosmith is kewl though hence why I'm listening to them, this is such a.. well kinky song I suppose, lusty is probably what I'm looking for. I've never heard the original but the way Aerosmith sing it just makes it like that... It was originally by John Lennon... "Come Together over me" it's the backing guitar it's kinda got this kinda slow beat that gets into you. I have urges to write poetry but I have no inspiration whatsoever which kind of sucks. I've been singing a lot recently, it also sucks but I'm not in the mood to care really so sod it.   My candle flickers in the darkness, A moth beats its wings fluttering, Towards my guttering flame. It breathes oxygen into my fire, and I burn passionately. My moth flutters into the darkness and the candle is left alone I flicker and flutter, flailing, Slowly falling into myself, turning into but a wisp, and now, I'm gone.

      You looked really sad and lonely today and generally depressed. I was trying to be there and hug you and hold you but you kept moving away so I get the feeling you didn't really want me there. I had a really funkay weekend though, so thank you. Xhx

      I've been feeling very weird all day. Psychology only lasted 20 minutes and then it was over so I went to the common room but the only people in there were not really people I would choose to speak to so I remained in there for a bit and got bored... so I wandered off. I found myself in the Music department and played on every single piano in there except the grand piano in the big room at the bottom, and I decided I liked the room over there the nicest so I went in there and played all the songs I could remember how to play and sang along to all the songs I knew the words too as well as I could which unfortunately is shockingly bad. I'm going to see Stereophonics on Saturday which is gonna be fun, to tell the truth I'm more looking forward to spending the night with Munch of course it's going to make me unable to sleep for the next few days as I will feel as though there's something missing... which is the reason I'm so tired on Mondays cos I spend most Sundays in your bed and hence miss you when I'm trying to get to sleep. I realise that I was traumatising you by being somewhat weird, and you kept asking why, and the truth is that I don't really know exactly whats wrong I just feel like a carton of juice... yes running that through my head it doesn't sound any better than drained by a hoover... so I will say I feel like... A car that's run out of petrol, I suppose that could be twisted as well but not as badly so I'll leave it at that. I'm listening to the Beatles because I really don't know what to listen to, I'm thinking Queen but I get the feeling I'll just start switching from song to song not really content with which ever I'm listening to. I'll listen to Let it Be cos it soothes me... like your voice, a balm. I feel like hugging but I've nobody to hug at the moment which leaves me feeling a bit morose. Thank you for loving me, it means so much more than you could possibly imagine.

      I'm falling in love with that song by Aerosmith it's so unbelievably cool it's also part of an eminem song that I like and I feel a lot better knowing that the good bit of the song wasn't written by eminem. Sorry for being weird today it's honestly Stereophonics and how tired I am. My eyes keep trying to close and it's kinda like being drunk but feeling sober. I really was really concerned about you last night, you were extremely traumatised. I knew you were in tears and the fact that you hung up on me really hurt a lot, I understand that you felt guilty but the fact is that you hurt and I couldn't make it better and that made me feel a bit shitty. You have no idea how unbelievably stupid and guilty I feel about not getting the Virgin Tickets cos that's what caused all the trouble for you, and it's my fault that your rents are in a piss at you and I'm sorry. Flicking my eyes back across that I realise that I wrote "I" a lot... which is a pointless comment I've just realised but it really did notice it so yes... erm okay so I'm a little bit odd. I'm listening to Stereophonics because in my head it's labelled as the music that Gemma likes and hence it makes me think of you sitting listening to Stereophonics, now I feel really really tired. I'm growing more and more accustomed to your friends and I'm getting on with peeps like Shez better. I think I pissed Shez and Dan off today though. I don't think that Shez understands that the sole purpose of the rock concert is that it is a charitable event and hence must make a fair amount of money to make the teachers realise that it was worth the effort of putting it on and attending it. Dan wanted to headline and since he's not the most popular band then it's a bit stupid to. So "Aural Pleasure" is headlining I decided. It's annoying that Shez doesn't recognise that people won't go if the band line up is identical to last time, plus he doesn't realise that his attitude pisses some people off and will discourage them from going to the rock concert because they don't want some uppity "long haired lefty pillock in a cat suit prancing around like a prick" I quote. Plus Shez is kind of trying to take everything over which really fucks me off because I was the one who originally decided myself to put on the rock concert so maybe he should at least little what I'm saying and treat me like an equal. He didn't even compile the results of the questionnaires he doesn't understand Hooper wants to KNOW attendance levels not have a "maybe" or "around" figure... Rant over.

      I don't get to see Munch till Wednesday :(  Raa Plus this keyboard sucks it misses out so may letters that its ridiculous but meh dot matter. The Russians keep going where I am and say hi, I have a feeling it's the only word they know. Margoux is kewl tho, mainly cos her name rocks. Plus she said that I was very good at the piano, admittedly she's French so her opinion is irrelevant but myeh. ART OF LOSING! Rock Concert Committee 2005 get ready to ROCK! Okay I feel mildly cheesy I think it's supper but I'm not sure.

      Wow Ryan's keyboard is luscious, it's really clicky and loud, I wish my keyboard was more like this one, but saying that, my keyboards buttons are all visible... I'm starting to get somewhat worried about how badly my parents are going to hit the roof when they find out that my results are nowhere near the straight A's or as close as physically possible that they want, in truth I'm getting increasingly traumatised in general about life on a whole, I have no idea what I want to do, where I want to go. The only thing I truly understand is the way I feel about you and even if that doesn't always make sense to me, then I know where I stand with you, and it gives me a sense of completeness. I didn't sleep last night, we started watching the Ring 2 after having watched the Ring, but Rebs and Ry fell asleep before it started proper and Segye started to doze off before halfway through, I don't think I could sleep without Munchkin or Gemma to keep me company, which kind of defeats the object of sleeping, since the purpose of sleeping is to recuperate energy which you have expended over the day, and you are alone when you sleep, actually you are nothing when you sleep, can you remember what it feels like to sleep? I don't the words I associate with it would be bliss, and... not darkness, but the absence of anything which solidly exists. "It's the heart that matters more" I said some things at you're party that I imagine you think was just drunken rambling... Yes I think I'll kill this thread here... I'm tired and missing you a lot. I hope you're okay cos it's misty outside... that could of course just be Benhall Gardens... but I hope you aren't too cold... I want Gemma.... Raaaa I should have brought her with me shouldn't I, thinking about it. I have changed my mind, Ryan's spacebar requires too much effort to push down.  I'm missing you and my heart tells me That at the very least I should be kissing you But is that my heart or my libido I guess we'll never know Unless you come to me Munchkin, And let me kiss you so...

      I got your letter today, well I kind of knew I'd get your letter today since you'd have to send it by first class and if it was sent on Monday it would be here by Tuesday. I found out that Gemma is a lesbian btw, she kissed the pictures of you, I had to restrain her. I even read her the whole letter, it made me smile lots and has done a lot to placate worries that have been growing since you left. I'm really worried that you may be hurt or traumatised last night, I couldn't sleep cos I was worried that you might be. Well again the lineup for today is sod all but I had a dream last night, and in it I was looking for you, and I caught the bus to Gloucester and then when I got to Gloucester I realised that you wouldn't be there because you were on D of E... but I looked everywhere anyway... and then I woke up at like 9... which is the earliest I've got up all week... well since Saturday. I'm gonna go watch the video for Vindicated cos it's an amazing song... oh dear Gemma is trying to call your phone again... well she headbutted the phone cos I accidentally bumped her over with the keyboard... and that's how I'm going to interpret it. I'm trying very hard not to call you cos if I do I just feel more lonely cos you aren't there.

      Raa, I missed you today and again you've only been gone for... well 24 hours now. Me and Gemma stayed in bed until 2 o'clock but she slept in till 4 cos she's missing you too. I've had a very lazy day cos I can't bring myself to do anything. I came online with the express purpose of blogging and talking to people but can't be bothered to talk to people. You'll have no idea how much reading your e-mail made me smile, well actually it was predominantly the picture of you which made me smile, cos I was in a downish mood and I saw you and it was like YAY! :) I haven't left any messages on your answering machine yet because it's going to make me miss you more, because I usually call till I get through to you... and this time I won't be able to. I was speaking to Alex on Thursday about slitting and she said that it wasn't a natural human response, I managed to disprove that notion, which doesn't mean I approve of it, au contraire I am very opposed to it, but it's comprehendable to me. Basically when people are stressed or depressed they need to displace this feeling into something else, now slitting is a physical pain. People have said why not do exercise? In exercise you push yourself as hard as you can till you hit pain barriers, similar to a degree no? Pain is how we push back our boundaries and stop ourselves bouncing off them.
