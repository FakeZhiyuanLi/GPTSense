      This is going to be a short post, well at this point anyway... ok so i'm doing great today, lots of study done, especially on the growth of nationalism - did anyone else notice how immensely HUGE Bismarck's moustache was ? Anyway, back to my point, so i'm just rounding up for the night, clearing away my notes and clutter that's strewn across the desk. I had dinner and everything while sitting here at this darned computer ! A thing i hate doing, but hey, i had to work. So after a delightful meal of spinach and ricotta canneloni my mouth tasted weird,that way that after you've eaten something and then WHAM a big minging taste seeps in, maybe its me, you know what i mean ? Anyway i went next door to the bathroom to brush my teeth, and not knowing that my sister's boyfriend was in residence i had the misfortune of walking in on him taking a pee... i don't think i've ever been so embarrassed in my life... i know what your thinking - he should have locked the damn door,  but then he didn't think that i was in..........wait a minute, that's no excuse, he still should have locked the damn door ! If there happen to be any psychiatrists, psychologists or any other form of mental health professional reading this blog right now, it would be nice to talk about my mental scar. I don't think i'll ever look at the guy in the same way again, probably because i'll never be in the same room as him again.

      The other day as i was leaving the the train that i had just boarded home from Glasgow, i heard some girl-ish giggling coming from behind me but didn't really pay much attention to it...i was too busy scrolling through my ipod looking for Jamie Cullum to be bothered what was going on elsewhere. However then the 'giggling situation' enveloped me as someone pinched me on the bum...yes, on the bum! i'm British so legally i'm allowed to use the word - Arse too, but not ass, thats the name of a donkey-ish looking creature. Anyway, not to stray from my point or anything but i was shocked. I turned around and there was this somewhat fifteen year old girl looking all embarrassed and what not. "it was her..." she said...as if i gave a damn, i was flatterred. However not the point, which is that women can get away with anything, for example if one were to reverse the roles i would have my face slapped and most likely end up in custody. Please ladies, in no way am i sexist, i just don't understand why you get away with what you do, it puzzles me so and it humours me, but i admire you for it. Keep up the good work!

      My friend left me in second year of academy to make her new life in her native Norwich. I was shocked at the time that she left so sudden as we had been close friends for a good long stretch...and we still are. I'm leaving academy next week and we are still in good healthy contact. I haven't seen Kim in a while now, it was two years this summer since I last seen her. Kim is lovely, she has one of those personalities that just make you want to absorb it all at once and explode with joy. You know what I mean ? Although  I only seen Kim for a few hours that day we just sat and talked and it was amazing how we could just pick up from where we last left off in a letter or a phone call.  If I love one thing in life its being able to write, I just love how one can store a thought in a few words or perhaps many, I suppose its a bit like how when one hears a piece of music and it just seems to describe everything that one feels at that moment or a previous experience. Although I'm still in good contact with Kim and I enjoy every moment we spend together or reading, writing letters...a few months ago I had a feeling that I wanted to have an international relationship, so I set up a profile in the hope that I would get some responses from people in different places in the world, and I did. A few weeks later Lynna e-mailed me from Singapore and we just seem to have clicked. I know people will think that this can't be good and she's only in it for a visa but it really is nothing like that, we are just great friends. She loves going to the movies and she studies media at university, actually she graduates this week. Although I haven't as much as smelled Lynna I just know that communicating with her whether it be through the internet or snail mail I know that I have a friend that I can always relate to. I guess I've been lucky in the friendship department, so what I'm trying to say is no matter where you have a friend whether it be a mile away or five thousand, they're still your friend and knowing that just brings that person straight to you and that is an amazing feeling that I don't think I could compromise for anything.

      As I walk away from my lousy part time job in a home improvements call centre that is in the dingiest settings imaginable at the back of the high street in my home town, I bump into a friend. By the way I've just been fired...'Good heavens why?' I hear you impatiently ask, well its as simple as this - it was my eighth shift and I had not yet brought one customer to the crap consultative that is Anglian Home Improvements. May I just add that I'm over the banana bright bloody moon that I did not get a customer to be conned into some shabby conservatory...Oh yes and for the record, everybody in Great Britain has double glazing, all except Dafydd Jones who lives in a wee one bedroom 'cottage' on a blooming hill in fecking Pontypridd, but good luck getting his number as he only gives it out to the neighbouring farmers who simply have to be avid listeners of BBC Wales!  Fair enough I went a little over the top there, but I mean who needs double glazing these days? Everyone has it! Try and sell some people four inch thick armoured glass...Now there's a seller!...Bloody terrorists...Anyway, back to meeting my friend. I had just nipped into WH Smith to pick up the paper...The Sun newspaper that is. Well to explain the look on my friend's face would be to explain why dolphins don't fart...well at least not to my knowledge. Horror, that's a good word, yes it was definitely horror that was strewn across her face. 'The Sun?!....you...read the...Sun?!' no, actually I don't read The Sun, I like every other man buy The Sun for only one reason and that's to open up that newspaper and stare in awe at.....the daftest bloody responses to peoples problems I've ever heard in my life! Honestly, Deidre Sanders must have it coming to her, she is the silly-est old bint I've ever come across, for example:  Problem - "my boyfriend wants me to have a threesome with him and his mate but I don't                 know what to do, I mean its just so unorthodox"  Advice - "oh I don't like the sound of this, this can only spell trouble, sex always               spells trouble, that's why I've never had any, I don't like trouble me!"  I mean for crying out loud! How can this woman deny people their fun! The bloody woman reels me...and that's why I read The Guardian. Now The Guardian newspaper is a reliable one, good facts and figures, fancy language and its guaranteed to give a giggle - none of these qualities do you find in The Sun.  In any other case I would never had debated the credibility of a newspaper because simply I find most of them a waste of paper - watch the bloody news for crying out loud ! If you watch it on the BBC you get a short Welsh man with a daft accent dictating the doom and gloom in the world, or if you happen to be a poor old sod and have to watch it on ITV then you might just see some exhibitionism in the weather report. I do love the Welsh, they always give me a giggle

      Yesterday i watched what has become my favourite movie. I settled down to watch Breakfast At Tiffany's and how visually stunning i found this movie is, for me impossible to tell you. The opening credits just did it for me, just to see Audrey walking alongside Tiffany's with her coffee and croissant was bliss, so casual, so sympathetic, a wonderful way to begin a wonderful movie. I have for sometime now always admired the appearance and iconic figure that is Audrey Hepburn, but i had never seen any of her movies. This film for me was so good that i could have cried tears of joy from watching it. I lost count of how many times her character said 'darling' but just to see how the romance blossoms between Holly and Fred - it was truly wonderful. I don't think i have watched a film that has made me feel so good since the first time i saw American Beauty. American Beauty is a masterpiece, the way that the film involves the watcher is just unbelievable - to see how the different characters find beauty in so many different things is amazing, i loved this film - i still do, and i believe that it will always have me smiling at the tragic ending, or on the other hand crying...come to think of it the last film i cried at was Bicentennial Man, i really enjoyed that movie but the ending was so sad yet such a nice way to end it, gave me that feel good factor that everyone deserves at the end of a good movie - and its an intelligent film as well, made me appreciate some things a little more. You know what i mean ?

      Well seeing as this is my first blog i wish to make it as enjoyable, amusing, and thought provoking as possible for you in the hope that you will have some thoughts for me to think upon, so here is a nice wee starter for you. While i was online the other day i happened to be browsing aimlessly through profiles and i found something rather intriguing. Intriguing that it was a report from Cambridge university and intriguing that Cambridge had produced a report which was actually intriguing for a change. The report stated that through thorough research it became known that poelpe colud raed wrods whituot the wrods bineg in the crocret odrer jsut as lnog as the frsit and lsat ltetres sayetd the smae. I found this particularly interesting as i've never noticed it before, but when i think about it i find that i do this on a day to day basis - normally when trying to communicate with some of my partially illiterate friends who are too quick on a keyboard to actually acknowledge what they are doing. Fascinating...well i like to think so...

      On Thursday of last week my friend - Aimée - came over and we had what has came to be known as The Baking Bonanza. Basically because we baked...alot. We made a delicious butter sponge cake and then melted cadbury's chocolate all over it which (from a distance) looked like an Atkins diet-er's paradise...of course it was. We then went on to make chocolate chunk muffins, thats correct people, chunk - not measly pathetic chips but huge mama bear chunks of chocolate went into these! They were alright, made my head spin a tad with the amount of chocolate that was in them. Oh yes and how could i forget, we also made scones. Now the scones - bless them - were pathetic wee things that were kinda flat, normally one would expect scones to be huge with a somewhat regal look about them. But can i just tell you, these were the most delicious scones i have ever tasted!(fear not, this is going somewhere) So anyway, just to stop the mouthwatering for a moment, another of my chums called me later on thursday evening after the baking bonanza had passed, i thought he would be calling to tell me about his advanced higher chemistry exam which i thought was thursday...he was mad at me because the exam was wednesday and he could have been part of the bonanza fun. Therefore i compromised and agreeed to go round to his house the following day to bake some more (feeling a tad like Martha Stewart now). Sultana and raisin cookies we decided to bake, only one little problem: we have no sultana's or raisins nor do we have any money to buy some. However the baking most go on so we use what we have at hand...peanut butter and oatmeal.  Fair enough peanut butter is great but when you start pouring in dried porrdige into your baking thats just a wee bit eccentric. Anyway the moral of the story being...never, and i mean NEVER try these cookies, or at least if you do mke sure that your next to a reservoir. I almost lost my voice through dehydration from one bloody cookie! So if you dare to make these cookies and then go on to eat them...on your head be it! Just noticed that i really do have a nack for parenthesis!

      I was in town today and i hate to say this but i saw a disturbing and rather disgusting sight as i made my way to John Finnie Street. As i was walking along Bank Street, a seagull came blazing out of the sky and swooped at a pigeon, slamming it on the ground. The pigeon was dead. The Seagull started ripping the poor bird apart and dining on its guts. It was a disturbing sight, there were people standing around gawping at this in shock but nobody would do anything about it - what could one do about it ? I honestly could not believe my eyes...i walked on and as i passed an elderly gentlemen who had witnessed the sight i heard him say "c'est la vie"...

      Yesterday i gave blood.  That statement is so powerful. Unless you have given blood before i'm pretty sure that you have no idea how it feels to know that you are going to give someone another chance at life by helping them stay alive. I walked into the local town where i would donate in the morning - its about two miles and it was a beautiful day so i thought why not. Along the way i did not feel fear, worry or dread - the only feelings i had was excitment and pride because i know that at the end of the day i may have saved someones life.  The process is not all that painful, just have a lie back and have a sharp pain in your arm that lasts about a second then wait about half an hour and then you can have a nice wee cuppa and feel good knowing that you've done something amazing.  I don't mean to be pushy but due to research showing that variant Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease (vCJD)can be transmitted in blood if you have been donating around the early eighties, the NHS are really crying out for blood donors - so i am urging you to do something for today to make yourself feel good and maybe save some lives by donating blood. Give an hour of your day to perhaps give another person life...please.
