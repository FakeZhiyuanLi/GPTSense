      Hi guys! I'm fourteen and it's my first time making a blog and/or publishing on one. I hope you read this little saying I cooked up as it also appears at the top-left corner of the blog. Here goes:      ü Life's full of CROSSROADS... And Fate ISN'T FIXED... It depends on the CHOICES we make when we meet these crossroads and... Life's STILL FULL of Crossroads... So don't miss "The Opportunity" once it knocks... ü   It might sound kinda corny with some people but the truth is... There's a really good meaning to it. And if you have a friendster account by the way, ADD ME UP&nbsp;please!!!     Here's my email address: kensapalo@yahoo.com

      Isa nanamang araw sa buhay ko ang dumaan. Another day has passed in this life so precious of mine. Wong chi chaw fong min jong wang mey wa (labo, gomen...). This year we also have nihonggo classes... Still wala pa ring kaming tina-try na mahirap gawin... like translating one whole...uhm... article from japanese to romaji(romanji [?]) or english. But marami pa rin nmn kaming natutunan dun.  like how to say what our parents proffessions are like and other nonsense:  Boku wa oto-san no bijinesuman desu. Anata wa otosan no bijinesuman desu ka? ore ore... taikutsu ne... nani nani nani nani nani???? nandemonai NE!!!!.... hahaha gomen, boku wa hen-desu... HAHaHHaAaHaAH  what am i saying?  ...  I don't know myself.

      Why is it that when we have a crush on someone we think it's okay, but why is it that we think it's wierd when you find out someone has a crush on you!  That's sorta the only thing on my mind right now...  To be honest there are two girls that I like... One, I met on the net and the other one studies in the same school as me... Why does life barrage us with choices?????  But choices are what separates us from others. Whatever similarities we have, it's always what we choose to do that counts. Teens seldom think of that when they succumb to peer pressure......  Ahhh I'm starting to talk like a college proffessor now... Eniwei, bye for now!

      i'm not really love sick but there's always that feeling when u feel that you need a little affection from a special someone... you know... somoene thats funny, always smiling when she's with you and never ceases to make you smile when you're down... I looove my days in Seven Pillars (theater classes) cuz thats where i met one of my crushes... ( he said "one" of his crushes...ooohh! he's a ten-timer!!! jowk!) that was a place i enjoy being in while being with good friends at the same time... oh those were some great days...  Phoem( her name's a secret ) , and the rest of my gud girl buds will always be in my mind...
