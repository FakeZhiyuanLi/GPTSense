      I made some god damn amazing peanut butter cookies this afternoon. I found a recipe, but like usual it pissed me off enough I didn't follow it. They turned out amazing, golden brown - zero burned product. I only made 24 though, I should probably reconsider making a few more. Wait, I need to buy flour first.  Not too much else is going on today. I managed to get a lesson in my Science course done, and made some dinner/movie plans with a neighbour.  Cleaned my apartment top to bottom yesterday. Yeah, original Martha Stewart right here --

      -- it should be interesting to see what my phone bill looks like next month. I'm in Canada, and I know it's .20 cents a minute to the States, so it shouldn't be  too  bad. Besides, this is awesome and it's a good cause.  So today has been pretty uneventful. I managed to make it to Adult Ed, unfortunately I didn't get to sign up for the course I wanted. I was hoping I could pop into a History, or Social Studies course; instead my sorry ass got stuck in a grade 11 Academic Science. I'm going to bend over and kiss my ass goodbye right now, because I'm only in the first lesson and my eyes are jumping out of my head. I'll take the Math course come August, it'll give me a full month for it, that way. Wow, that's one fucked up sentence.  I also popped into Job Connect earlier, thinking maybe someone there could send me in the right direction, instead I got this sermon about it being almost mid-july, and how did I intend to get a job now? Seriously, what the fuck. Ugh. I didn't expect that at all, and next time I go in there it'll be to show them my new name tag for a job I got  on my own ... thankyouverymuch.  The kitten has been sleeping for hours, she'll chew my ass later.

      I got a call from Mr. Judd this morning informing me that I  did not  get the job. I thought I could shrug it off, which I have, except it's still slightly crawling under my skin. He said I was the perfect canidate, and the only reason he didn't hire me was because I don't have a drivers licence. Now, I need some help with the login behind that. If I'm not working, how the shit am I going to cough up $400.00 for the licence? Excuse me while I go blow money out my ass --  I went down town for a few hours today. Had to pick up some juice mix, cleaners, and of course freezies (its fucking hot out!). Brought that home, and then ended up going  back  down town for a few minutes. Decided I'd check out the midway, but let me tell you that was a piece of shit. Went to the grocery store after that, picked up what bit of money's worth o' groceries I could, and took a taxi home because I couldn't fanthom walking 35 minutes with 5 million pounds in food.   Today is bullshit. I need some sleep.

      There's a song, theme song ( or should have been ) for the simple life I believe. It say's " Ms. Hilton you must be worth a trillion bucks. I've got the feeling that you don't really give a fuck! " Not class, but that song has been on replay in my mind all day. Although I haven't evaluated whether or not it's a bad thing, it won't likely be pleasing to the people around me if it continues.  I'm getting  extremely  frustrated waiting on Mr. Judd to phone me back. I really need this job, and the fact that my future is just sitting in his hands kills me. I mean, I never wanted any part of my life to depend on someone else -- independant woman to the core; but it seems like if I don't get this job life is going to be a hell of a lot harder. Call me a wanker, but I'd love nothing more than to live the easy way for once. I remember going to a psychic on my 16th, and 17th birthday; I had been told both times that regardless of how hard things may be, or what roads I take -- I would  suceed . That thought is music to my ears, and I can only hope it's true (regardless of the stigma).  A couple of friends came by earlier, gave the apartment some life for a few hours. I'm content sitting at home, shootin' the shit by myself, but I find if company comes over I go out of my way - in a sense to keep them here. I don't know, friends love it here [minus the no-smoking thing] but I find they become just as irritated by my crowd pleasing ways. What happened to the old Stephanie? The hard-ass that told you to get your own fucking drink. Someday, she'll come out from hiding.
