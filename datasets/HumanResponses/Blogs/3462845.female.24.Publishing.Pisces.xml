      Yesterday was the first time that I wore my kippah outside of my house. I'd made a decision a few weeks agao  that I was going to start wearing it on Shabbat and at Temple, during Torah study, and on festivals & holidays. The idea that wearing it helps me make a distinction about the day appeals to me, but I hadn't actually begun to do so, yet. I think mostly because I am still somewhat self-conscious at temple- do they think of me as a real Jew? Would people be offended if I began wearing a kippah? Would it seem like I was trying to be more pious than them? I realize that even though these are legitimate questions, in the end they don't matter becaues they aren't the *right* questions for this situation. Wearing a kippah is about my own connection to God, to my spiritual space, and prayer- not the people around me. To make a long story short, I wore my kippah all day yesterday (Shavuot) and I'm glad I did- it really helped me be aware that it was a holy day and not just a regular old Wednesday. I was still a little self-conscious walking into work- more because I'm not fond of drawing attention to myself physically, and really, on the streets of downtown Cincinnati it's not exactly common to see someone walking around with a kippah- especially not a woman. After that I felt fine and went on with my day. I got a couple of questions and a couple of weird looks from the uberboss, but other than that, no reaction. Which is good.   I was talking to with my two best friends a couple weeks ago about my desire to possibly enter rabbinical school in 5 years. Both are born-Jews and have been incredibly supportive of me over the past couple years and my own journey towards Judaism. But, they each had very different reactions to my anouncement. L* said she wasn't surprised- she thinks that a) I would be a great rabbi, and b) she could tell just by listening to me that this was a path that I would eventually end up on. A*, on the other hand, said she was completely surprised. I was a little confused as to why it would shock her, until I talked with L* about it. Her theory is that A* has always known, in an overarching sense, what she wants to do and who she wants to be- there are the obvious logistical issues, like schooling and jobs, but she knows what she wants as an outcome and how to work for it. L* and I, however, are the opposite. I've never had a very concrete idea of what I want to eventually be and do with my life. I've thought of a number of options over the years, but nothing has every completely grabbed ahold of me. L* thinks that A* doesn't understand being at this point in your life and just figuring out what you want. We talked about it a little, but I still wanted to explain why I was thinking about being a rabbi. So, what I wrote is, basically, the following:   The short of it is that I'm drawn to it. You asked me if it was emotional- and I guess on some level it is because my attraction to Judaism in the first place was more than intellectual and spiritual- my emotions were tied up in it, too. It's emotional in the sense that it *feels* like the path I shold be on, instinctually. I've learned to trust my instincts more (though I don't always listen, I am listening now) and this is where my instincts are guiding me. I'm going to stop short of saying I feel a calling- because that sounds like I'm hearing a voice (or voices) in the ether, shouting out to me that this is what I should do- and I don't have that. It's internal. What I have is a desire to connect to my spirituality on a deeper level, connect to Judaism on a deeper level. Ever since high school I've thought about teaching because I wanted to help and connect with people at that level- but I never seriously pursued it because I don't feel passionate enough about what I could teach. I love art, and I have a passion for it- but it is a very personal passion, one that is hard to teach, hard to explain,- it's emotional for me on a level that cannot really take words or language. But, when I began studying Judaism and thinking about converting, I thought- this is something I could teach because even though I have the emotional tie, I also have an intellectual tie and a language to describe it all. This is something that I have grown passionate about, and it's something that I feel I can, and want to, share and teach.   I think we all have a desire, in some way, to serve people. A* wants to go into public service, become a lawmaker. I want to help people find a connection to their religion and spirituality like I have. I could be dismissed- the zeal of a convert and all that. But, I know what it feels like, to be emotionally and spiritualy cut off, and then to find that connection that makes you feel whole again.   I know I have a long way to go before I make a real, firm decision. And I'm okay with that. I'm looking forward to figuring out who I am as a Jew over the next few year. I don't know where I'll be in 3 or 5 yers from now, but I have a strong feeling that moving down this path will make me a better person, no matter what the final decision is.

      I have an lj, and I'm on myspace, but I wanted a blog that was totally devoted to my journey into Judaism and, over the next few years, maybe towards rabbinic school.   Here's a quick rundown of who I am, and where I am:   I am a 24-year-old Jew-by-Choice. I converted this spring (March 30, 2004) with the Hebrew name Chaya Elan. I'd been studying and working with my rabbi for a year, studying on my own for about a year and half, and thinking about Judaism for 2 and a half years. Over the past few months I have felt more and more drawn to rabbinc school. At the risk of sounding corny, I feel like this might possibly be my calling, so I am going to work over the next few years to get to a place where I feel comfortable making that decision. As it is now I feel I don't have enough experiance as a Jew and in life to make that decision; I'm still sorting out where I stand in my own observance. But, this is something I feel I want to commit myself to in the future, so I am beginning my work now, both spiritually and intellectually.

      First, a response to the anonymous person who commented on my previous post. You wrote: "From your name, you're female, and if that's the case, why a kippah? It's for men only. From what I understand you did not convert to Orthodox Judaism. You seem to be a sincerely spiritual person, who would feel more comfortable with Torah-true Jews. Don't stop learning, and don't limit yourself. Take a good look at what true Judaism offers."  While I appreciate your (apparent) concern for my spiritual well-being, you are more than a little off-the-mark. You are right that I didn't convert through the Orthodox movement; I converted under Reform auspices. I did this for a number of reasons, and even though why I do something is not anyone's concern, I'll explain them a bit. For one, I agree with Reform theology. I won't just blindly follow rules because I'm supposed to. I don't necessarily believe that the Torah was handed down, in tact, at Mt. Sinai, but I nevertheless feel that is the most important piece of literature to the Jewish people and more complex than we'll ever really know. I also don't agee with the role of women in Orthodox Judaism. I respect women who feel those roles are for them, but I don't agree. While you say that a kippah is only for men, I disagree, and as a Reform Jew I am able to make the decision for myself as to wearing it or not. I choose to wear it because when I do I feel it helps me step into a spiritual place and moment.   As far as feeling more comfortable by looking into what "true" Judaism offers, I will respectfully disagree with you about what constitutes "true" Judaism, as will any Reform, Conservative, Reconstructionist or Humanistic Jew. Judaism has evolved and changed over the years to a point where Judaism can, and is, practiced a number of ways, none of which is superior to the other, but each of which allows those under that movement to connect to God and to Judaism. When I was first learning and studying Judaism I looked at all of the movements. I know what Orthodox has to offer, but that is not the path I chose. Being a queer woman I would have been relegated to the home and condemned for who I am; I got enough condemnation growing up in the Catholic Church, thank you.   So, I am a Reform Jew, a proud Reform Jew. And as a Reform Jew, I don't just pick and choose what I do because it's easy or because "Reform Jews do/don't do this." I do things that help me to grow in my spirituality, feel closer to God and the Jewish people. I go to services every week. I study Torah every week. I wear a kippah on Shabbat and on holidays. I pray when I can at home. I read. I engage. I study. Each day I continue to choose Judaism because it is my path, it is my home. And if you, or anyone else reading this, has a problem with me being Reform, a woman, and queer, and still practicing Judaism, I honestly am not concerned. I didn't choose Judaism so that I could be judged unworthy. And I didn't choose it to be accepted by the multitudes. I feel that I am accepted by God and that is, above anything else, what's important.  --------------------------------------  This past Friday, my temple hosted the Ordination class of 2004/5764 from Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati. It was a packed house with a crowd almost as large as High Holy Days and it was really a nice service. Our rabbinic intern was being ordained so we had a special interest in the class.   Saturday morning I went to the ordination at Plum Street Temple. It was beautiful and very moving, a commencement like none I've ever experienced. Each student was so emotionally tied to the rabbis ordaining them that by the end they were all in tears. It wasn't a cold handshake with someone who means nothing to you, but instead a true handshake and hug between student and teacher and now colleagues. It was very moving for me to see David ordained because he was such an integral part of my education since I met him last year. He and his wife were also good friends to me and made me feel welcome at my temple from the moment we met. I would say that I learned just as much from David as I did from my rabbi who sponsored me, but in different ways. David sat in on my Beit Din, as did his wife and their small daughter. I will be forever grateful for David and his comfortable way of teaching, and I will be forever connected to his family as they saw me grow from a timid beginner to a confident Jew. He will be an amazing rabbi and I will miss him greatly. His new congregation is blessed to have him.

      I go to Shabbat services every Friday plus most Saturdays. I enjoy services for a number or reasons, one large one being that it gives me time, away from work, away from home, away from thinking about anything stressful, and I can use this time to actually focus on things that are important to me. Like praying, and thinking about relationships and friends and family. And many times I will close my eyes- usually briefly and then for an extended period during silent prayer. This helps me- helps me shut out people around me, helps me focus in on my own thoughts and feelings and prayer. I don't do it because I'm tired or resting my eyes or need a nap. I value this time too much to waste it on sleep.  Which leads me to the most recent Shabbat. Apparently at one point, while I had my eyes closed, one of the women who I know from Torah study noticed this. She was sitting across the aisle from me with her husband and thought that "it would be really funny" if she poked me because I looked like I was sleeping. She told me this afterwards and I had to restrain myself from telling her off. Here's why: I go to services to pray. I consider this time to be sacred for a number of reasons, theological and personal. I don't go to be entertained, or to people watch or whatever. I understand that there are probably a number or people who go for the social aspect, or out of duty and obligation. That's fine. I respect that. As long as they respect why I go. To even consider poking someone to cause trouble or have fun or whatever when you don't know why this person is doing what they are doing in a place of worship is incredibly disrespectful. At least she had the decency to not do it.   I feel just as frustrated by people who want to chat during services. Honestly, that's what Oneg is for. But, sometimes it's hard to avoid. There's a very nice older man who is my Hebrew class and who comes every Friday. He insists that I sit with him most Fridays and it feels rude to refuse. At the same time, however, he's very distracting throughout, making comments at various points, and it disrupts my own prayer. This week I was able to avoid sitting with him because his wife was there, but other weeks it's hard to refuse. I don't want to hurt his feelings or be rude, but it really bothers me.   --------  This fall I'm going to be the art specialist for my temple, doing art projects every other week with the Sunday school kids. I'm looking forward to this, but I'm a little nervous. Fro one, I've never taught children before. I've taught art to seniors in high school, but that's it. But, this will be good for me, I think. Not only will it get me more involved at my temple, but I'll be learning right along with the kids. Plus it will give me experience with teaching aspects of Judaism. My rabbi thinks this will be a good introduction to teaching at Sunday school so that in another year or so I can teach actual classes. Both he and the religious school director seem pretty excited that I volunteered to do this (and, by the way, I thought this was totally volunteer, but it turns out they actually pay me). I met with the director last Thursday and she sent me home with a bunch of books to start getting ideas for projects. I'm hoping to do projects that help the kids really think about Judaism and their Jewish identities- less crafty, more conceptual art (as conceptual as you can get with K-8). I'll still have to go more towards the crafty with the younger kids, but one of the ideas I had was for Yom HaShoah: I think it would be good for each kid to create their own Holocaust memorial, something personal, original and totally their own, that they could put on their shelf and see every day. It would, hopefully, help them think about their own connection to the Holocaust and make it a more intimate, and powerful, experience for them.   So, I'm excited about this. The added bonus is that what they are paying me will cover 95% of my dues for the year, which is nice. Finances can sometimes be a bit tight so it'll be nice not having to worry about that.
