      July 9. I woke up, so sleepy and realized that this is the day. After 2 hours in school, I would be meeting our muse, Ms. Roxanne Guinoo of SCQ. At starbucks, where we(me and Paul) were supposed to meet, we saw more than what we expected. We saw many other artists like the JaBoom twins, Melissa Ricks, Sandara Park, Neri, Maxene Magalona and Michelle. All so beautiful. All so scorching. Tantalizing if u listen to english class. We then received a message that Roxanne was waiting inside Ateneo gate 2 already. sO a convoy was made and my car was leading a pantheon of today's newest talent. When Roxanne went out of her car, she was different from the other Muses. She was soft spoken but very kind. We gave her a letter and a bouquet of flowers. She has the talent to be a soap opera queen... She is also very pretty and pleasant to be with. Paul escorted her in the parade and my class and everyone actually started making a raucous when the celeb muses walked the courts. Nagtatampo pa c Tej dahil hndi sya escort, sorry nalang mehn.. nxt year..haha just like last year, ang daming taong nagkagulo para lang makapagPiktyur kasama muse ng 3B. Champion e. Champion muse, champion class. Sana lang. kaya nga may muse tayong ka2lad ni Roxanne e, to be inspired to be the best.. I hope and I do know that my class appreciates the efforts I put here. Enjoy ang 3B, enjoy rin c Roxanne. b4 the opening ended, the celeb muses had to go away bcoz they knew it was gonna be a celebpic fest in a few moments. Haha, we left, went to ABSCBN and life continues... she just made my day complete.. god bless that girl called Roxanne..

      I'm just listening to Seven Nation Army over and over and over. I'm gonna fight them off, a seven nation army couldn't hold me back. Kani-kanina lang, we were in UP doing the RA with the help of the other group. Ang baho sa UP LAgoon. The water is black and damp, the air, so dense and filled with a stench. We were like a bunch of dumb asses who were holding yarn across the evil pond. After RA, we were having a celebrity photoshoot. Finally some class unity. Some only. We took pics with the naked man, Mr. Fernando Poe Sr. or Oblation. The english lt was a pain in the butt. Damn Ulysses. Damn the rules of poetry. The Computer lt was a breeze. A stroll in the park. A visit to Pegasus. I'm so sleepy but I can't sleep. I have to lend my Girl next door dvd to Tej, excuse myself on friday and meet my muse tomorrow, Ms.Roxanne Guinoo. A beauty to behold. The White Stripes. Simple but strong. I'm gonna fight them off, a seven nation army couldn't hold me back. aNYWAY, WITH THESE MANY TASKS, I'd fight them off.. they couldn't hold me back...coheed is next
