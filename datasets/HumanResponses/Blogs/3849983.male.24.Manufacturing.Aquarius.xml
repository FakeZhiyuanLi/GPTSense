      I leave for Shanghai on Saturday morning. Not a moment too soon 'cause I'm going nuts in that hotel. I'm staying in a serviced apartment in Shanghai, and its close to the office too. I'm hoping that it'll be a lot more fun to be there instead of the rotting cesspool of boredom and despair called the 'Park Hotel.'  Since I’ve been here I've gone to this little sushi restaurant near my hotel a few times. Its a conveyor belt restaurant with the sushi traveling around the 'bar' and you take what you want and the colour of the plate denotes the cost of the piece. Its pretty cheap too. I usually spend between $60-80HKDs which is like $11-15CDN and its really good quality and so efficient it has to be Japanese. I can't believe there isn't one of these in Toronto. There is a trick to the seating though. Try and get a place close to the beginning of the conveyor where the food comes out. if you are at the end of the line odds are there isn't going to be any tuna pieces left. Another funny thing is the big sign saying service with a smile. Well I'm not too sure about that, because the food preparers all wear SARS masks. I'm seeing a lot of those around. It’s kinda creepy.  Another thing about Hong Kong is the fascination with elevator music. I'm talking about rip-off instrumental stuff that is not really played anywhere in North America anymore. And this stuff is played everywhere here. At least in the tourist areas and restaurants. And it’s really annoying, because frankly is gets stuck in your head and there is little you can do to get it out.     Talk to y'all later.

      The most shocking experience I have had so far in Hong Kong is something that I should really dismiss. It has to do with lunch today... Has anyone seen the classic guilty pleasure movie 'Demolition Man'? Well if you want to its ususally on TBS once a week on average. But in this bad 1990s action flick there was a scene when Sly Stallone, after being frozen for 40 years or something, gets invited to a restaurant. The place they go is Taco Bell. But not the Taco Bells we are used to. A futuristic, classy version, that Taco Bell only wishes it could be and that I'm sure they paid a lot of money to the producers to make it look like. Well for lunch today we went to Pizza Hut. When I first heard this I was like, I'm in Hong Kong and I'm going to Pizza Hut? Not too impressed with the idea. But not wanting to be the annoying new guy I went along. I was shocked! Somewhere between Toronto and Hong Kong Pizza hut got classy. This was not fast food. It was a nice family restaurant. Food still sucked, but it looked better then a lot of fancy places I've been to. I couldn't stop thinking about that scene in Demolition Man. It was like another world. I've seen the commercials for Pizza Slut here and they are the same ones we have at home bragging about how they have the technology to get 4 gallons of low quality cheese into the crust of one pizza, but I did not expect this.    Well in other news all this eating with chop sticks is having some consequences. I'm pretty good with a pair of chop sticks. I may not be too graceful with them and my technique is a little off compared to Asian standards, but I've had a few compliments. Unfortunately I have used them so much its getting painful to use them. Literally I have a bruise and a welt on my middle finger from the sticks. I guess I'm going to need to develop a callus, that or wear some sort of protection.   PS Taco Bell and Pizza Hut are owned by the same people... Coincidence? Hmmm or maybe the heat is just getting to me ;)

      the weather here is hot. hot hot hot! as Adrian Cronauer said in Good Morning Vietnam ' Basically, it's hotter than a snake's ass in a wagon rut.' That sums it up pretty good.   I've gotten into a bit of a groove here, I know how to get from point A to point B pretty well now. And I know how to deal with all the annoying sales schmos trying to sell crappy custom suits and knockoff watches. the trick is to look angry and keep walking, and hey will ignore you, and if they catch you at a cross walk, just tell them off. There's nothing wrong with being a jerk now and again.   Well then that's pretty much all I have to add. i've only got one week left here in 'King Kong' befor eI go to Shanghai. According to the weather service its even hotter there. merde.   going to find a nice cool place to hide in, Ben

      This whole expat thing isn't hard at all. Even though I don't speak the language and have very little idea of where I am, going, or have been, its quite easy to live here. As long as you have your umbrella and an octopus card, there is very little you can't do. The Octopus card is kinda like a debit card (you can recharge at convenience stores) that is used for transit or any other place you would normally use change. Just put the card up against the reader and poof, no need to fiddle around with coins. You can even use it at 7/11 and&nbsp;the circleK stores, as well as vending machines. Mmmmmm, rampant consumerist progress.   Went to a 'French' restaurant today for lunch and I use the term French lightly. The only thing French about it was the colour scheme. When you serve mainly pasta and Italian style dishes,&nbsp;and there is bad Cantonese karaoke being played on several TVs in the joint, there ain't much French going on.   I'm finally going to open a bank account today and then I will finally be able to get a phone and contact the outside world on a more regular basis. YAY! The bank makes foreigners get letters of recommendation from their businesses or long time customers of the bank, to open an account. This was really necessary because we all know I have soooooooo much money to launder.   Lata. Ben

      Sorry it's taken me so long to update but I haven't had an Internet connection until now. But I've finally settled in and am getting accustomed to my new surroundings. A lot of people said I would be in total culture shock, but I don't think that has really happened. I notice a lot of differences, but nothing has totally shocked me. I did hear a story on TV that was very interesting. There have been complaints and allegations that food from the mainland, that is not suitable for Hong Kong consumption, has entered Hong Kong... In interviews people kept talking about how bad this food was and how it&nbsp;is low quality and&nbsp;not suitable for Hong Kong and it is meant for the Mainland... My question is&nbsp;how is it more suitable for the mainland if it is not suitable for Hong Kong? This country has come a long long way, but I think there is a ways to go yet.  &nbsp;  Anyways, the food in restaurants here is amazing. The ladies I work with have taken me out to lunch the past two days, once for Dim Sum and once for Japanese. Both times to was amazing. Everything is so fresh here, and some of the prices aren't really that bad, and it can be incredibly healthy too. You don't see many 'large' people here (even though MacDonald's seems to be very popular).  &nbsp;  What else is there to say...? My Hotel ain't all that great. There is almost no cold water, there is no gym, and dinner is more like a mob scene in the buffet line. It was interesting, I honestly felt unsafe in line for the hotel buffet, old women were pushing their way&nbsp;through. There was a complete lack of manners. I don't think I will ever get used to that.  &nbsp;  By for now  Ben&nbsp;

      Well its only a few hours until I leave and I think it has finally set in that I'm leaving for the other side of the world, with little knowledge of what the hell I'm doing there. Yeah I have to admit I'm kinda nervous. But I know that I'll do fine and everything will be alright. But the idea of living in a very foreign country on the opposite end of the globe is quite imposing. But I'll deal.    I just want to thank all my friends and family who have made doing this possible, and as easy as possible, and I will miss you all. You know you can always reach me by e-mail at canadian_18@hotmail.com and I will send all of you my telephone number as soon as I get a phone over there. I'll do my best to keep in touch with all of you and I expect to hear from all of you.   My plane lands in Hong Kong sometime around 6am on Saturday. So that's about 6pm Friday for most of you, so expect a few calls a few hours after that when I get to my hotel and settled in.   Well I've got to finish packing, talk to you all later.   Ben

      Well I'm in the home stretch, and am just taking care of the last few things and seeing my friends for the last time. Kevin and the crew from the cottage got me a great picture of all of us from that weekend. Well if there is anyone I don't get around to see, well sorry but time is not something I have much of.    I leave in a matter of hours. I guess packing would be the right thing to do now... Nah, I have until about 7pm on Thursday to do that.  My sister picked up her new car today, thanks to my fantastic skills at hunting stuff down. But I'm proud to say that I've had the same car for 5 years problem free. Subarus kick ass.   I'm gonna get one of my last to sleeps in Toronto now. Take care.

      Its just over a week until I leave for Hong Kong. As expected I'm a little nervous, but there isn't much I can do about that. I still have a lot of poop I have to do around town before I leave, like sell a car and get my finances in order. I also have my cousin's wedding on Saturday, which will be a good time. But other then that, my life is still pretty boring. Maybe just a little busy at the moment.  Thought of the day: Altoids really aren't that strong. 'Curiously Strong' my right nut. False advertising I say.

      It's been two weeks now in Shanghai and things are still more less the Same. I've spent the last few weeks in the hardgoods department trying to learn how to do business with Chinese people. There are 2 kinds of people here in China. Those who know how to do business really well, and those who are rather out of sync with the rest of the world and the Way to do business in a global environment. unfortunately the latter compromise the Vast majority of people here. if Seems that people will go behind your back, mis-lead, lie and cheat their way into making a little more money that the t don't deserve. It's like a Culture of hussling     here.   There's  not too much else going on, the Typhoon everyone was Scared about was nothing at all. The roads are still as dangerous as ever. I  move to the Clothing division next  week. So yeah...Um...that'll be fun. Ben + fashion = disaster.   Well everyone Take Care,   Ben

      Sorry its been so long since I've last posted, but this is the first time I've been in from of a computer since arriving in Shanghai.   I've been here a week now and have a pretty good idea of what goes on here. The first thing he so shocking was the driving and general traffic and the lack of rules and respect for any sort of order or for anyone else on the road, pedestrian, cyclist or Motorist. With 300 road deaths a day in China and thousands of injuries you have to experience the chaos on the roads here to get a real feel for an almost Hobbesian like experience, where no one trusts, respects or cares about anyone else except what they are doing. Red lights and other obstacles do not guarantee that people will stop. This goes for everyone not just cars. Pedestrians and Motorbikes and scooters and cyclists alike have a total disregard for everyone else and going out on the road is a danger at anytime. But the roads and especially the highways are very well maintained here.   Last week I went on my first factory visit. To get there I took a two and a half hour bus ride, then a one hour cab ride. This was all air-conditioned and as pleasant as it could be with a bit of a hangover and too little sleep. The factory itself wasn't anything I didn't expect. BTW it was a dog accessory factory that made stuff like coats and boots for dogs. It was filled with a whole bunch of chatty women, going about their tasks while drinking tea constantly. Now the factory wasn't air conditioned, and was quite hot for me at least. But everyone was always drinking tea, hot tea. I really have no idea how these people keep from melting. On the way back we had the option to take the bus or the train. We decided on the train, it was leaving sooner. It was to be a 4 hour train ride. It was actually a little early, however, it was not air-conditioned and was packed with many people who were is various states of undress. It is perfectly socially acceptable for men to wear very little, even in close quarters.   This was also my first encounter with the real China. Shanghai isn't exactly the best place to experience China. It is a very international city with plenty of wealth. On the train was the rest of China, and when you see a grandmother give and huge belch and on one even notices... You are in China. Manners here are almost non-existent. There is no need to cover up your mouth, spitting is acceptable, peeing in the bushes is tolerated and the list goes on. And people wonder why China is always the starting point of epidemics.     The work here is good. I've met a lot of people I can learn a lot from and generally Shanghai people can be quite polite. My apartment is really nice and in a decent location, my issue is that there is only one english TV station. China Cental Television 9 (CCTV 9). This is a state controlled broadcaster with only propaganda on their mind. Their world news seems to only mean China related world news, or how China is related to said news event. In the week I’ve been here I’ve only seen one piece on the American Election, but about a dozen pieces on Chinese singers performing around the country. I even watched a few pop music videos on another channel. They really reminded me of fascist propaganda films that glorify the military. The only purpose of these videos are PLA recruitment, showcasing their military might and China's glory…Using old Russian designed hardware. They don't point that one out.  So in an attempt to get away from it I bought my self a DVD player and a stack of copied movies for 8RMB or 90cents each. The copiers do a great job of adding subtitles and menus, its quite impressive. Although a few discs I've bought are dubbed in German with no way of changing it. So that was about $2 lost. Uh oh.   Take Care, Ben
