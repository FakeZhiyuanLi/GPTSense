      I want to kick myself in the face that I didn't have the idea for this site first.  Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you...  urlLink Go Fug Yourself .  This website is crack for my hungry, needy soul.

      Please regard the all-company email that I received at work today.   I can't believe I'm having to write a group of adults about what can and can't be flushed down the bathroom toilets. As you can see by the attached, someone attempted to flush newspapers down the toilet yesterday. I'm not even going to hazard a guess as to why someone thought that was appropriate behavior. To make matters worse, this is not the first time this has happened, so it's time to address the situation. And it happens on both floors and in both the men's and women's restrooms.    We have low water pressure to begin with on our floors. You need to use some common sense and behave like adults in using the facilities. This behavior needs to stop now. It's an embarrassment that we continue to be reprimanded by our building management.    Please understand that I realize this is going out to everyone, but is truly only aimed at a few.    I can't believe that I am writing about such a disgusting issue.   I am not one of the people in question. But seriously? That is awesome.

      I've forgotten how to write. It's been such a long time since I picked up a pen, er, typed on my keyboard. It feels weird, and almost a little bit uncomfortable to sit here like this, looking at this screen that I don't recognize anymore, trying to figure out how to fill it. I'm not even totally sure why I'm doing this. I suppose it's because... I recently scored a freelance writing gig (How? I have no idea. Who lets someone with no real world experience produce actual content for them? A crazy person, that's who. I work for a crazy person.), and got inspired. Writing is fun! And it makes me happy. So...there you go. Nothing to it.  So much has changed in the last year. Shit. Where can I even start? So, I met this boy. He was cute. And fun. And smart. And not crazy. We started hanging out all the time. All the freakin' time. I introduced him to my mom and my friends. Which I had never done before. Ever. One night I realized that I had fallen crazy in love with this boy. And by some freak of nature occurrance, he'd fallen crazy in love with me too.  My boyfriend kicks ass, man. Major ass.  Fast forward a year, to the present. We found an apartment together, moved up to San Francisco, bought some furniture and a cookbook, and for the last two months... it's been pretty great.  And now I'm sitting here, in our loft, with the Olympics (male gymnasts freak me RIGHT out) on in the background, telling it all to you. As you seen from the above, I have no idea how to tell a good story anymore. I just summed up a year in three paragraphs! Either I suck, or deserve a gold medal in brevity. (Hey, how's that for the Olympics tie-in? Sucky? Yeah, I know.)  Please be gentle. It'll get better. Trust me.
