      all my relatives were quite proud of when i decided to stop the nasty habit. but i have definitely felt the need to relieve myself, and since i have quit growing pot, smoking seems to be the easiest, legal way to pursue my human drug abuse behavior. 1st fag - things tend to increase in complexity and the always present feeling of strangeness within me is getting stronger. sometimes i like to use the notion of being out of sync with reality.  currently my diploma thesis fills every hour of my day, even when i am not writing. it is about dsp algorithms realized with dedicated floating point hardware, and the goal is to do it as generic as possible in a hdl of my choice. although through most of my university time vhdl has been the dominant hdl, verilog has been present since the early 80s, however the inflexibility quickly led me back to vhdl. my field of interest can be described by hardware/software systems engineering, and considering my grades i am a first class hardware geek. One of my dreams has always been this one big bang scientific thesis to end my studies and begin my diversified work in a renowned high tech company. dreams tend to fulfill themselves the way they want, they develop their own personality along the way.  2nd fag - when i did the necessary research for my thesis i skimmed through every possibly related book in the library of our institute. needless to say i read the majority of them already during the past 3 years. because one of my co-workers is a registered ieee member he has web access to all scientific papers related to computer science. this was the material i desperately needed: thousands of papers directly dealing with floating point hardware. concisely presented, fascinating material - i already envisioned my big bang thesis.  3rd fag - now what could possibly irritate me in a way so that i start smoking after all this time? it is my personal insight that with my current scientific knowledge i wont ever be able to produce a thesis competing with the papers i have read on ieee. i always experienced that mankind's knowledge was hard to grasp as a whole, however now, trying to implement the already existing mathematical facts into high performance silicon, it just seems impossible. along the way of this perception process i must have lost my motivation and now deadlines concerning my thesis are closing in and i am thinking of packing in on my scientific career. metal bands like amon amarth have strengthened me, but now their lyrics raise the wish to just run off into the woods and live like a human being is meant to live - hunting for food, basking under the blue sky, not fearing death as it is the natural effect of life.  4th fag - i am 23 now and when i just continue my life the way i did, the feeling to be out of sync with reality will inescapably increase. science and politics are more connected than i originally anticipated. every society tries to breed a scientific elite to prevail in future conflicts. perhaps all these new opinions of mine evolved by reading "The Selfish Gene" by Richard Dawkins which explores the relatively new field of memetics. every idea, every opinion, every kind of art represents a meme spreading itself throughout the human race infesting our brains. the ultimate impetus of such memes is, like genes, domination through reproduction. in my opinion the ongoing search in every human being for a sense in life is obstructed by the complexity of the currently circulating memes. when every meme occupies a certain amount of brain capacity according to its complexity, then the individual search for truth is somewhat limited. the more we allow foreign memes to infest our brains the more we adopt to foreign truths making them our own.
