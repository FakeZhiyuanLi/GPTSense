      Hey everyone! My day went by pretty good. I had 2 tests. One in science, another in US History. They were both easy! I wanted to go to a over nighter at South Baptist church with tons of my friends. There is going to be games, movies, video games. I also wanted to go, to see my old friends from Grand Ledge/ Tons of my old friends are going to be there. But I cant go because my dad won't let me because he doesn't want to drive. It really sucks!! Now I am stuck here at home bored, when the whole Grand Ledge High School is at the church party having a blast. Ah well....  Besides this my day went fine

I've had a good day and I am going to watch the season finale of My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance tonight! It is going to be hilarious!   Over the weekend I went to my friends' Bart and Joe's house. I went on Friday night with my dad and we had a party with them. We sat around and played cards with my friends' aunt and uncle, their mom and dad, and their mom's friend, Cathy. My friends' family has 9 kids and they are all cool. Whenever I go their we always have a good time.  Well anyways. We went there and we had a good time. My dad left and I spent the night Friday, and Saturday and I went home Sunday.   When I got home I took a shower and went to my sister's Gymnastics meet in Battle Creek. I was there for about 3 hours and when we got back into town we all went to Ponderosa Steak House to celebrate. I had a really good weekend! I'll post tomorrow, until then cya!

       SPECIAL TRIBUTE:    Hey everyone! Last night (4/21/04) I went to a old neighbor's funeral viewing. it was really sad and I saw my old friend luke. I haven't seen him in like 5 years, but he was really sad and didn't feel like talking because his dad died of brain cancer. :-( Lee (the dad) was really cool and we all hung out and im sorry that he passed away. he was a good man. well thats all with that.   Today in science we watched a Earth Day movie. It tested us on how much we know about earth day and i scored really high! YA!!! lol. well during 5th hour we watched the senate candidate speeches to see who we are gonna vote for for next year. im not voting though because we have to register to vote. we have to go see a teacher and give her our ID card, to be able to vote. i lost mine. lol. no one really cares and only a handfull of students registered lol.   in english we're almost done watching a movie called the heat of the night and in math we are doing postulates! its really gay. thats about all for today. see you later!

      I went up north to Houghton Lake on Friday. I went with Bart, Joe, Luke, and Ryan. We had a cool time. We were ding-dong-door ditching the neighbors, IT WAS HILLARIOUS!! I went up to a house and knocked and I ran but I tripped and my shoe flew off and I couldn't find it. He chased us, and told us to go away. Bart had to go and get my shoe. He snuck through the back yard from the woods. My shoe was stuck behind a tree hidden. It was really funny.   We also went on a bike ride to go pick up pop bottles on the side of the road. We went down a huge long dirt road a couple of miles down. We turned left in a fork in the road and we went down more. We didn't find any cans so I talked them to go into the woods. The woods were on either side. The woods were dense too.   So we went in and we came upon a swamp. We went into it. After a few minutes Jesse fell in. A little later my shoe went in and I fell to my knees. I was laughing so hard, it was really funny! :-)  We got out of the woods and we went back home. As we were riding home we came up with a plan to tell their mom. We were going to tell her that we saw a pop can on the side of the road, by a ditch full of water, and I went to go pick it up and I fell in. Jesse also got wet because he tried to help me. So when we got back we told Mrs. Benn that and she believed us.  We also rented movies. We rented "Cat in the Hat", "Brother Bear", "Ernest's Snowboarding school", "Willard", and "Cold Creek Manor".  I watched "Willard". It was about a guy that has no friends and he befriends rats and trains them to kill. I also saw "Cold Creek Manor". It was about a family that moved into a house. The previous owner showed up and he wanted his house back so he tried to kill them. "Cat in the Hat" was gay and I never want to see it again. :-(  So on Tuesday night we were being loud at 1 o'clock at night. Mrs. Benn heard us 5 boys upstairs and she sent Kristle up stairs to tell us to be quiet. We told her to leave, and Mrs. Benn heard and told us we were going home tomorrow. So the next day we packed up and went home. Mrs. Benn was really, really, p*ssed.   My dad came to pick me up and I've been chillin here all along. That was my Spring Break. It is Friday now and I have 3 days left up break. I've had the funnest spring break in a looooong time. Peace out ya'll!!! CYA.
