      It all started out because the estranged  urlLink Jennyeahyo  got ahold of me through my first site which was in no way blog related.  I'm an internet celebrity in my own right, you see. (edited).org, my brainchild, was the most prolific of it's type back in it's day.   Many many hits a day sort of shit but who's counting. Doesn't matter 'cause it's offline for now.   She messaged me and like a good blogger linked her URL to the bottom of that.   Her current post at the time was something along the lines of:  "To celebrate my birthday in the month of May, I had my first lesbian experience. Thanks  urlLink Bing , it was cyberlicious, dude.  The first hit in her "tagboard" which she had in lieu of comments was from  urlLink this kid .  The tentacles went out and I got wrapped in and one by one I began stalking these people. I think that's how it went.   He was breaking down to me how everyone got into our little circle here.   " urlLink Raymi  and I met on the  urlLink Vice  message boards."   urlLink True  told me the same thing over pancakes and some fancy salmon encrusted salad in some Manhattan breakfast diner last month, saying "and that sort of 'set the tone' for our little circle".   "Then I found  urlLink Jamie  through  urlLink NYCBloggers.com " then . . . I forget.  I used to think  urlLink these same thoughts  before. Smut and drama lure in readers 'cause that's waht people watch on TV and alot of the really talented people get next to no hits. Voyuerism into that smut is how they escape their own sad realities and I had nothing to offer - didn't do drugs and I had no titts for hits. No sexlife to speak of and nothing entertaining aside from self-induced solitary alcoholism which was so depressing I could barely bring myself to make an entertaining paragraph of it.  I had like 5 hits a day and for some pathetic reason it saddened me. I didnd't understand why everyone read these sites so religiously but like John broke it down "Raymi's site is the entry point and cornerstone of this circle".        I can't remember why. . . I think I asked where  urlLink Stacy  came from and that was his reply.  Just read an article from  urlLink rocketpack  and then there's nothign "supposed" about the talent. I mean, the shit's funny. that's just my view.  I forgot where this was going. . .

      Some of my favourite bloggers have been deleting their comments sections and it's filled me with something. . .   I've always been on the verge of doing so, but damn if my lazy ass rarely goes out and finds new sites of my own to read. I've met those same favoblogopeople through their remarks / complaints about my site. . . I wouldn't want to take away the possibility of meeting more. It's not malcontent with the current lineup, more like greed.  At the same time - the difference of writing comment-free is drastic. Flash back to when this crap started 2 years ago and how much more I wrote, free-er and clear-er. More riddled with spelling urrrers and with more poorer grammor but . . . something special about it.   Sometimes I need that. I liked the idea of the "Fragments" I saw linked from  urlLink Radiohumpadora's site , too.  No editing, just free fucking flow.   So here I have this site.  Never edited.   No drafts composed.   No comments.   Nothing to see here.  Freeflowing procrastinatory should-be-doing-somethingelsebullshitthatwont'beofanyinteresttoanyonesojust.............................................  Move along.

            aint no such things as halfway crooks.   this is mostly to get you listening to mobb deep.  this is also to let you know that it's either blind faith  or it's just blind .  we're not asking for much.  we're asking for everything.  harder, i suspect, to give it up piecemeal.  consider this act of faith an act of kindness, also.  bravely inviting you into our homes instead of invading yours.  we've got a lot to talk about and a lot of listening to do.    turn that shit up, is what i mean to say.  the thing about conventionally accepted wisdom and caught phrases is that they can eat a dick.  for instance, the saying    the meek shall inherit the earth.   this may be true, but who wants what's left over after the savages are through?

         I'm sitting here in front of the computer, 2:24 am (regardless of what it says for you), my brain in the upright and locked position.  There is a beautiful young girl in my bed. She's sleeping and dreaming of things I can only imagine. I don't have that luxury.  I am far too wired and tightly wound to go sleep next to her in the warmth and comfort and security that two young people can provide for one another.   See, late at night is when I am most alive.  Always has been that way.  How can I sleep, how can I shut my mind down when it works the best in the dark, lonely hours of night? I can't shut it down. I can't shut it up.  So I cant sleep when it's time to sleep.  Does that maybe make me abnormal?   And how this relates to anything that might be desired on this particular blog, I'm unsure.   But with my current feelings, that old blog that I been kickin' around, it just doesn't have the same luster. It doesn't seem pertinent anymore.   And for once, I might be feeling that I am not alone in this world.   But, I still feel daft for bringing it up.  My one constant wish in life, my one never-changing desire has always been to make something happen.  I know that's vague, but its genius is its simplicity.  I've really gotten tired of the whole  wu wei  attitude of the people around me, my peers and friends, my life, and the stagnation and slavery I've subjected myself to over the past twelve or so years of my life.  I want change now more than ever.  I want total social revolution in my time.   Didn't our parents tell us that we could do anything? Does that include telling them, making them see, they are wrong. Their country is wrong. This process is wrong.   Bush is a fuck.  Kerry is a fuck.   Politics is fucked.   It's an outdated system that the rich and powerful use to keep the rest of us little folk in check, so as not to usurp their power and personal resources.      I'm tired of being the ant in the ant hill. I'm tired of being the cog in the wheel.   I'm tired of being in a world where everyone strives to be unique by being like everyone else, and that is called freedom.   Freedom is the ability to buy whatever you want?  Did you know that immigrants live longer than us folk born here? Six years longer, in fact. At least on average.  Did you know that black males from Africa, who immigrate to the united states, live an average of NINE years longer than black males born here in the USA?   All this comfort and stability and money and debt and stress and bullshit, what the fuck is the point?  My dreams are unrealistic. But what isn't unrealistic, is the present actions of our young people will effect every generation ahead of us.   Without action, there can be no change.   Do you think honestly that the Democrats will do any better? I don't.  And that's the sad part. Unless we scream so loud, nobody will ever hear us. And it seams to me that the longer we sit, and we wait, and we lay down and become comfortable and doze off into dream land, the more we deserve the shit we get.   And that really is the crux of the biscuit.

      so hello,   everybody here?  good.  first things first  we need a place.  i'll get security covered, unless someone else has an nyc hook-up.  i thought maybe one of those huge buildings in dumbo.  you know, five floors of action packed dark art and dj vibe.   we need folks to start sending the link to this site in emails to folks who get shit done.  some big ballers who can really make a club night happen.  (naw mean!)  make it more m.c. than hippie.  hip-hop people get things done.  it's all about mass production.  that said i think we need to keep it spicy on this site  to keep up morale  we've got a lot of work ahead of us  so here's my suggestion:  we invite some of the other side to join our party.  that's right, some writers from the  suck  bush camp.  i'm just playing  but you know,  some republicans and neo cons  maybe even a christian  what we need is some good ol one-on-one  a little conflict, a little intrigue  and the occasional round robin  (maybe a circle jerk, while we're at it?)   whaddya say?  you guys ready to make it real?  i say we start by inviting  urlLink this guy   he was the one arguing all day with  urlLink tony  in the  urlLink busblog's comments .  he's smart and has good points.  and we agree that michael moore doesn't count fer much.  listen, if you can write  urlLink you can write .    i say we add as many mixed up ingredients as possible  to give mrtt a wicked fucked-up flavor  one that makes it drastically different from any other politically themed site out there.  (bitter, like a vitamin without a capsule)  and if it all gets too much  the cool thing is that most of us aren't really into politics and would be happy to talk about something else  and besides the main point of this site is planning a party  so there are a lot of options.  my ride is here.   holla.  trueboy@gmail.com  or comment

         a light side & a dark side, but is it really so simple?  Yah, sometimes, prolly, but not today, and likely, not yesterday, and honestly, not ever.  Like me, I’m not such a bad guy, really, yet, truth, I’m a registered republican.  In high school I agreed wholeheartedly with a lot of the shit that Reagan & Bush senior were doing, but further confessional, I started sweating when desert storm numero uno hit the scene, thinking, shit, am I gonna get drafted, am I gonna be off in that desert shooting at this year’s version of the enemy?  Am I gonna be that guy that people remember, the one who maybe had so much potential, who got shot in the back while sitting in a hole looking at a nudie mag, wondering when the night would come, sweating to the oldies in the back of my head and wishing to fukn hell I’d never been goddamm fucking born?  Fuck, I’d rather walk through cloak’s nigh insatiable darkforce (left side of the comic cover above – google cloak & dagger, interesting set of characters) and see what I find, see what inner demons are foaming out of my mouth, purged of all wherewithalls, rather get shot up full of daggers of light (care of the yin to cloak’s yang, dagger, throws light knives and is the only force that can satisfy cloak’s hunger) than have to catch bullets and shrapnel swathing through an alien shore. And what’s more alien to me, a white boy from Glendale, than Iraq?  Shit.  mars would be more of a reference point.  Yet there I would be.  Well, it didn’t happen.  I’m not there, never was, but the point is, we’re sending our peeps over to a lost land that was maybe never found, one that we thrashed & burned and now have to patch back together, and, well, we can’t leave.  Which brings me back around.  I’m not a hardcore conservative by any means.  My years at cal Berkeley permanently affected me with the disease of liberalism, tempered by my belief in the need to defend this country and not prop up every goddamm crackhead with a few extra bucks and the incentive to keep popping kids out to keep the flow flowing on that welfare faucet.  I’m a middle of the road pile of donkey shit. fuck, I honestly don’t know whut my politics are.  I vote for the guy that doesn’t bother me.  And gore bugged me.  I don’t like people saying they invented the internet & that love story was about them.  But nowadays I like even less when little boys at the big people table decide to settle an old score from their old man and hunt down some scapegoat ass motherfucking despot in the middle of buttfuck nowhere middle east division.  But again, we’re there and we’re square and we can’t go nowhere.  Ferreal.  What would you have us do?  Walk the fuck out?  This ain’t Vietnam kid, that was already a tea kettle in extreme levels of percolation.  We, on the other hand, started this fire, to quote billy joel, and, well, fuck, smokey the bear ain’t gonna let us off the hook and neither am I.  Problem is, we stirred the pot so bad that it’s strait up tnt nitrous fukn nitrate, fuck, the most dangerous chemical in the boulevard, and, well, ok, yah, we bail on it, and it’s like, the worst warlord of the month hacks his way with a bloody sword to the top of the heap and they hate America just as bad as they did in the first place and go on killing people in underground cells with secret vendettas, basically the same shit that the rest of the world prolly does here & there except they’re not so out in the open about it.  just don’t be ostentatious about your shit, I guess that’s the rule.  Fuck, I don’t know.    So, yeah, fuck bush, but I’ll tell you, I’m scratching the fuck outta my head trying to figure out who the fuck can properly clean this mess up.  And it sure the fuck ain’t Kerry, homey’s too busy countin duckets and eating ketchup and rehashing old war stories to put forth a solid idea on anything besides, fuckn, fuck, I don’t know, it just seems like a total load of opposite of emaciated horseshit, and maybe venting frustration about it is a valid form of ruckus bringing ie for the valid ongoing betterment of the country world and 4th parallel, fuck it, whatever, I lost myself at yah.

      Monday I got this email from Sterling Fassbinder.  Keys to the kingdom, baby,  she wrote coolly, above an inviation to join this blog. Keys to the kingdom for me? I held them a moment in my shaking palm & then I pocketed them for a few days. Feeling too unsure of myself to post anything, too convinced that I don't know how to make things work, or rally anybody around any cause, I sat back & read the other posts, feeling guilty.  Keys to the kingdom,  Sterling beckoned from my inbox. I don't have anything political to say, even in these days fraught with catastrophe. But I'm good at parties, & I wanna help. I've got a decent-sized place in Brooklyn with a long rambling roof overlooking the city & I have a lot of friends & I'm also into making more. It's important, making sure Bush gets fucked. It's important that as a country we don't keep veering off in this horribly wrong direction. It feels bad now, but I hope it's because things are going to change. What Kafka said -- "Between being lost & being found there is the realization of being lost: the only true agony, as a foot that was asleep begins to wake up" -- kind of comes to mind. It's a collective case of pins & needles ... on 8.30.04, let's shake it off.

         Finally.  urlLink Al Gore grabs his nutsack and gives Bush the finger.   Too bad he didn’t call him out like that when it mattered, four fucking years ago.  Oh, but that’s right, all his fancy, high paid campaign advisors told him not to say anything too extreme—to shoot for the middle cuz that’s where the votes are.   Don't get me wrong, I can't help but like AG.  He's smart and philosophical and concerned about the environment, but that shit cost us.  The country was coming off of eight years of prosperity during which HE was the VICE PREZ and he lost the election.  Yeah, I know about Florida and the Supreme Court and the registered black voters who didn’t get their names on the lists at the polling stations.  I know about the money and the faulty machines and the red country and the blue country, but seriously, he should have never let it get too close to call.  The democrats are a bunch of pussies.  They have not made the crucial decision to win this election  by any means necessary , like the republicans have.  They don’t want to throw mud and they don’t want to come across as unpatriotic or (gasp) unchristian.  Since when is calling out the abominable truth about the direction in which your country is going unpatriotic?  Since when is throwing the cold hard facts back in your opponent’s face the wrong way to run a campaign?  Clinton won in part because he attacked.  He spent money on hardcore fuck-you ads and he said it like he meant it in his speeches.  Kerry just goes on about his decorated war past.  I guess he thinks that because he was in Vietnam we’ll all just assume he’ll make a better Commander-In-Chief in Iraq than Dubya.  I’m not so sure.  One thing he can’t make commercials about are all the bills he helped past.  Because in all his time on the Senate he only got two through—and both had to do with marine biology.  In other United States of Assholes news,  urlLink here's another state  I won't be vacationing in...let this be a reminder that we're partying against the whole sick crew of right wing conservatives, the christian coalition, and even those  urlLink log cabin fags  who switched sides because they came across some health and wealth.  fuck you,  sisters , how can you talk about changing the system from "the inside" when  urlLink dubya can't even say the word "gay"?

      i can't decide if that means yo' momma or just yo momma but it's not really relevant to this posto amigos.  so what can i say? the most inspiring force in life is passion. i watch them crazy taiwanese fist fight in the legislature and i think holy shit, those are some crazy mutha fuckas. then i sit and marinate in it, i think about the peoples of spain and how they came out on the streets after the bombing to protest their government. i see the japanese hold candlelight vigils at night to demand that their government remove their troops for their hostages in iraq. what i see is a flame in these peoples' eyes.    they're going to the streets, they're taking the streets and they're going to own their own streets on their own terms.  that's right, they own the streets.  they're beating their heads with their fists, their faces are red and bloated from frustration, they're raising their voices to their governments and saying, yo' momma. that's right, they own the streets.  they ain't just all talk, they do it and they put the rest of us who marinate on the couch to shame.  whether or not the outcome is predetermined, they fucking do something because they think that something better is possible.   that's right, they own the streets.  it's not about being liberal or conservative, democratic or republican*, it's about using your freedoms the way it was meant to be used, the same freedoms that other people die for.  non-action is just giving your life away to some people who don't give a shit if you live or you die as long as it fits into their neat little foreign policy. don't give it away so easily because it's hard to get back.    you gots to come, party hard and then stick your fist up and say yo' momma bush, yo' momma.  i guess yo' momma is relevant to this post.  sorry momma bush, w's going down this time...and he's going to take his anti-choice policies down with him.    urlLink dubyaspeaks    *granted it would be better if you're not because you might trip every at the paaarrrtttyyyy out

      i am adding a quote to all this weather talk:   "What if there was just snow? Snow everywhere, cold and white, filling every distance? And I just follow my sense of things through this winter until I reach a grove of white trees. And she takes me in."  Denis Johnson  for two years, i rolled 3 times a week. I saw everything that you have seen. and was transfixed by all of it. And held everything. You can do a thing you cannot do. This is what I can do: a chalice kicked over at sunset. You cannot move thru a lineage to music that should have died centuries ago. Letting the world go, so it's just us. You will demand of them, and you will not thank them, and you will dismiss them. There is no language of the dead; not as it's been defined, as such. There is a very specific, singular comfort to leaning on your arm at a certain time of night; I am lighting up this evening, and I hate you. I hate you so much i would kiss you forever. I have a hangover,   and we start the work. Why don't I just go out to dinner, and just have a steak and shut up? Let the heart.... you are everything to me, and rebellious and looks and love and anger. "I must win or die". You love it, tonight.  you are told me I believe you and the salt is licking across the land F O.H  ok two quotes.   groovy this was my name when i was all *anonymous* once upon a time. that's hilarious. now it's just what was i on when i chose that one? i didn't like it then either. also, it should be wallpaper* blake. three guesses what was in front of me when i did it.  ROSENCRANTZ & GUILDENSTERN ARE PANTS  IT'S CALLED "THE BUSINESSMAN WHO KILLED THE MAYOR AND SMOOCHED BLANCHE A LOT AND THEN BECAME MAYOR AND SMOOCHED BLANCHE EVEN MORE"  THAT'S NOT GONNA FIT ON THE THEATER MARQUEE   SUCKS TO YOUR MARQUEE, WE'RE GONNA PERFORM IT ANYWAY   and true what time signature are you on?

         This is our Alamo. Our Rumble In The Jungle. Our Battle Of Endor. Our future children will come back from their high school American History classes and give us a swift kick to the crotch first thing they come home. Let’s put just as much attention towards the world right now as we do to our outfits and our fucking hamburgers.  We need to reinvent the wheel by first blowing it up. Let’s smoke the ashes and build something new from the scraped-out resin.  I don’t know what to say. I don’t ever talk politics. Shut up. I don’t like to. I liken political discussions to philosophical and theological ones. Pointless. Done before. Talked about over and over. No winner, blah, blah, etc. I’d rather write, read, smoke, drink – but I can’t stand it anymore. These last four years have slowly crept up on me. I didn’t start to smell the shit until it started flooding into my house. Time to clean up, folks.   How? Ask the dust, said John Fante. No. Ask True/Sterling.   Come back here.  We’ll help.  Whatever I have is yours.  Go.  Because I don’t want to get kicked in the crotch by my kids.  That shit hurts.

      Now, I don't know if this is an over-extension of my privileges, but to be honest, I've never been one to account for that sort of thing. Fuck the rules, that's how I feel...   I don't want anyone to get the impression that I'm the smart guy. Cause I'm not. But like Mr. Montana, we know the streets.   I'm an undereducated fool who got himself a computer, a couple a packs a smokes, and a serious desire to bring down/cut through/eradicate the propaganda machine.   But the real point of this little stupid fucking post is one little thing - I don't know why I want to see this whole thing come about, I don't know why I am so all about the party slash protest slash whateverthefuck you want to call it, but I am. I want this thing to happen.  I plan on representin'. I plan on bringin' the dawgs in too.   So whatever anyone needs - If I am able - You's all gots it Chi-town connection

         What to say, what to do, what to, hmm, the expectations, the wherewithalls, it’s like, the eye of the overfiend is blazing right across my chest & ankles, like “yah, punk, whutsup?”  how do you properly describe a situation in which all kine personalities and politics (although I have this teensy eensy feeling the veer will be a la izquierda) meeting in one place, the city of Nuevo.  As I jogged (yes I leave my computer, but only to take the meat for a walk) through downtown honolulu last nite I found myself pondering the dynamic of NYC as this place where any and all kinds of random ass hardcore shit go down and the irony of the matter in that it occurs in such a geographically organized locale.  I’m talking about, of course, the perfect gridlines on which YOUR island’s streets are built.  I pondered this because oahu’s thoroughfares are governed by no such governances, and you can go sidearm, swizzle stick, shit, you’ll be scooting yer legs over back & behind a spot you were just in with little or no ill effects to the continuum or nearby locales.  It also got me thinking that I’d recommend you folks stick to the ground, or even underground, literally, I mean, I’ve only been to NYC once, years ago, but I was amazed, as an Angelino born & raised, at the degree to which peeps pack on the mothafuckin streets ovah theah.  I’d always thought that crocodile Dundee shit where he had to climb up the street light to see that chick was a typical Hollywood bullshit cadence, but, hmmm, if memory serves correct, it was every man woman child possibly ever born happenstancingly wandering the same boulevard as your hero/villain, whatevayacallit.  But back to the point.  As I run the streets of the other h-town (scarface, no disrespect) I see the strategies so much more clearly, when you’re on the streets, outta your car, you are cognizant of the levels, the tidbits, bums hanging out behind iolani palace over by the statue of queen liliuokalani, a homeless vagrant making his dwelling within a stone’s throw of the USA’s only royal domicile.  And right next door, the senate and house HQ, which I’d never set foot on, well I ran right through there, feeling like rocky, taking it to the streets, to borrow a phrase from myself via decades of pop culture, climbing up the admittedly short flight of stairs, inside yet outside, coming out the front and admiring the art nouvea father Damien statue, and then, there it was, an exact replica of the liberty bell, and, weird, I’d just been thining about phillie via sly stallone’s oscar winning characterization of a down and out lump of muscle.  Uh, hmmm, as usual, I’ve rambled myself into a corner, but I’ll say it again, wander, peruse, get underground, overground, but stay out of cars as much as possible, to get the real vibe, the real feel, the real energy, of all these sharks and self-eating manatee that will be invading your already crowded & world famous city.  Cruise with the AC on full blast and biggie and pac, social relevance notwithstanding, blasting from your speakers, and you’ll miss it, you’ll miss what they’re doing, who they’re talking to, the brainwash squads will be out, and if you wanna counteract their likely dastardly schedule, and get your own movement ocillating, and not roll by the crux of the situation blissfully unaware, if y’all are serious about affecting people and making them understand the status quo does not have to be the way the will and the wang-chung, then remember where that shit’s gotta start.

      She dances on the dimly lit big oak table with two scimitars, gleaming catching the light, the grace of her arms proves Shiva the destroyer is not wicked or unkind. Like the hawk talons snatching the rabbit, searching and penetrating the heart until the screaming and kicking stops, food for downy chicks. Her skirts are long and full, leaving the strength of her legs to the imagination. The big room is hung with tapestries and art, comfortable seats, a mountain of delectable edibles and vats of wine and home-brewed beer. The band's music is seismic, twenty musicians, a horn, ten guitars, an upright bass, harmonicas and kazoos, a flute, two fiddles, a big drum, castanets, banjo and bongos, sometimes Greek or Spanish or Brazillian music, sometimes roaring 20s, sometimes solid sweet trance-for-dance music and the dancers join in with clapping and singing and stomping.   The seeds of discontent are sown around the crowded room with each smile, each nod, each sip of red sweetness  in vino veritas , and the clarity of vision reaches all. The more people smoke herb the more Babylon fall, said the prophet. Lighters and candles flicker and outside a bonfire flickers and voices and laughter flicker and then roll like waves.  There is a dream here, buried and shunned by the thickening mass, a dream of freedom and equality for those who believe in it. Dreamers dream; there is enough for everyone. Implement your hopes and carry an idea of peace in your hip pocket and when the mass hardens, pops and sighs, emerge and inherit the life dreamt.   I see smiling eyes in the half light of a grinning moon, eyes that know secrets, eyes kind and also cunning. At the horizon the crescent of Venus descends and will soon be gone into the dark misty shape of trees. High above in the clear indigo speckled with silver hangs blue Vega and dark red Mars, Draco slithering between. The cold crisp grass holds the imprint of our bodies, small white daisies and clover crushed momentarily beneath the flesh, hearts pounding, our own here and now freedom. The music and laughter drifting, the scent of baking pies and barbeque and smoke, the proof of joy stretching to the contour of the forested hillside and declared in the shadow silhouettes that dance around the driftwood bonfire that burns green like energy.   Tomorrow dawns clear and golden.

      yes.    pre and post disco extravaganza I see a river’s edge world, you know that old school movie with Keanu Reeves.  feel the vibe with me: the TV’s on always and drugs are lying around like cigarettes among the fast food wrappers, there’s burrito sauce splattered like blood on the microwave window and everyone has overgrown hair and wears heavy metal t-shirts without a hint of irony.  we’ll throw our sleeping bags in the backyard, get thoughtful with our pipes, stare up at the purple sky through the black tree leaves and listen to the swish swish of the nylon as we change positions.  (and change we must)  fyi the only stars in new york city are on the ground.       I was dreamin' when I wrote this Forgive me if it goes astray But when I woke up this mornin' Coulda sworn it was judgment day The sky was all purple,  there were people runnin' everywhere Tryin' 2 run from the destruction,  U know I didn't even care  'Cuz they say two thousand zero zero party over,  oops out of time So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999  I was dreamin' when I wrote this So sue me if I go 2 fast But life is just a party, and parties weren't meant 2 last War is all around us, my mind says prepare 2 fight So if I gotta die I'm gonna listen 2 my body tonight  Yeah, they say two thousand zero zero party over, oops out of time So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999 Yeah  Lemme tell ya somethin' If U didn't come 2 party,  don't bother knockin' on my door I got a lion in my pocket,  and baby he's ready 2 roar Yeah, everybody's got a bomb,  we could all die any day But before I'll let that happen,  I'll dance my life away  Oh, they say two thousand zero zero party over,  oops out of time  We're runnin' outta time (Tonight I'm gonna) So tonight we gonna (party like it's 1999)

      Wow... I'm shocked and amazed that I would be invited to partake in a blog-o-sphere spanning event such as this one... I guess it stuns me because I've come to see myself as the "black sheep" of the blog world, the red headed step-child with the tight under pants and dirty chin from PBJ and spaghetti-o's. That could be my own self-absorbed ego though, I dunno for sure.  I'm not incredibly social, I'm kind of a morose misfit, and I'm generally un-stylish as far as style is concerned. BUT... Chaos is one place where I am in my element.   unfortunately, my party prowess extends only as far as -     diversionary Tactics Management'   First it is important to know -   One has to be especially careful when utilizing the crack team of D.T.M., as many youngsters and untrained party peoples have been caught up in the carefully constructed, yet oft-simplistic plans of this secret sub-organization. Extreme instability runs rampant among these folks, and sometimes people can get hurt.   Second important fact -   The DTM is much like the USA's own CIA in many ways. They are a secret organization that operates in a shroud of secrecy, answering to unknown leaders, gathering intelligence and working towards their own ends. Little is known of their true goals, but it is believed that they have an extreme distaste for any sort of ancient and malevolent authority-type figures.   Well, Bush, mostly... Which is not so much like the CIA. But that's besides the point.   The DTM is all about the ruination of structure, the downfall of solidarity.    and a quick and effortless death to the  two-party system .   Ah, but is this a revolution of style or one of substance?   And at this point, is there a difference?   If a party is to be had, why not this one?  So I say unite all you internet junkies, Digital camera cross-dressers, verbal brain-rapists, talk-is-cheap hippies, word-of-mouth funk masters, full-frontal blog automatons. Unite, acid droppers, pill poppers, vegans, and speed demons.  All the rude, crude and totally diluted.  Do something. Fucking make a stand.  Your party or their party, eh?   :)">

      And blah.  My first offering.  Can only think, for some reason, of "Pretty Vacant" by the Sex Pistols.  That song, and the dastardly creep creeping feeling that I'm flimsy, pretty babies.  Evidenced here.  My first missive to the revolution takes about two seconds to get into "me me me" territory.  Would that Fitz were here.  I may be wrong but I feel that we would form our own sexy archipelago of flamboyant "freeness" right next to or within the larger and more politically motivated "freedom".  The freeness floozies.  Making sure that the revolution stays well-accessorized and has enough margarita mix.  Plus blingy gumball machine rings for every finger.  Unity, bitches.  But it's necessary.  I should make this known now.  I'm as unconcerned with the state of this country as I am with just about everything else that doesn't smudge my eyeliner or get in the way of me kissing cute boys.  I'm the worst.  Worse even than most teenagers are in this day and age.  So worse I want to call myself, grammar police be damned: WORSER.  But fuckit.  I just should let you know that if the revolution and this sexy change we are discussing don't allow for me to have new Nike Air Force Ones  every month or so.  Well.  I'm bailing.  I gotta have something to march in.  Happy feet make change, lovies.  I'm not all bad and selfish things though.  I should balance this caveat out a bit.  Some of my more tasty realities.  I have heart.  I won't stand for being disrespected.  I talk a gang of shit and I'm quick on my feet in a discussion.  I know the best combinations of cusswords.  I make stencils.  I have two healthy middle fingers at the ready.    I learned to dance, sexies, among angry black teenage girls.  I'm fucking bulletproof when it comes to insults and sneaky armor chink pokings.  I'm simultaneously intimidating and inviting as fuck.  I feel quite alright breaking someone's head open with my largeness.  I'm yer double triple four hundred times agent: no one's made a category for me yet.  I cannot check one box on any form presented to me.  I can tell you what sneakers look best with those fatigues.  I love you.  And you.  And you.  I can't help it.  Be about it or be without it.   edited to be even more vainglorious.  it's a revolution, bitches.  enjoy yoself.

      I used to help my friend run an after-hours from his storefront studio in the Main & Hastings section of Vancouver a few years ago. Main & Hastings is the only offical slum in Canada, and reminds me, fondly, of the Bowery before The Protestants Of New York decided to power-wash it. The Down from M & H is famous both for its strength and due to the fact that it's regularly cut with fibreglass...which, actually, is fine with me, because heroin users always think they're the  only ones . Anyways - my job was to do "door", which meant, basically, just to sit there outside the front door on one those fold-up chairs that your mother told you would cut off your finger if you played with it, smoke speed & get rid of the people with stupid questions ("uh - what's the vibe like Dude?", "is it gay?", "have you of xyzabcdef etc. etc.?"). My favourite attendees were the cool japanese ravettes who didn't give a  fuck . I never asked for cover cause I didn't feel like it. Vancouver & stealing...you've heard the stories - money wasn't really ever an issue. Sometimes, we, collectively or individually, forgot to book/procure/trick a DJ to spin. So we'd fake it & spin, sort of, ourselves, during breaks from our 'regular' duties. The effect was completed by Robert telling everyone he knew Boy George. These often turned into our best night/days - toilet still worked by 3pm, no cops, everyone left feeling special. Super -  Fucking - Special. Once - we actually had a fairly famous DJ - Dave "Friendly" Clark, but no-one showed-up -  no -one - but Dave remained, for 6 hours, and spun, basically, for me and this transcuntual bartender. Then Dave drove me home. He rested his hand on my head like it was the headrest the entire drive.  It felt like love.

      bring the beef.  bring the ruckas.  TRUE put me in charge of the  urlLink party planning  committee.  Everyone who responded to the first two posts re:  urlLink "Skullfuck Bush--Party at the End of Time, 8/30/04, NYC"  on  urlLink BRANDTRUEBOY  has been invited to post to this thing.  Once I get your responses, I'll make a few of you admins so you can add pictures and links and other beautiful things.  For all my bitching these last two years about not being an admin, here I am now, shitting bricks because I've never done this before!!!  Basically, this is a spot for brainstorming the perfect party.  The idea, as it stands now, is to get a space (like a club or abandoned building),  DJs (the more the merrier), acts, food, sleeping accommodations (who’s gotta floor in NYC?) etc, etc…  We’ll iron out all the particulars in good time (like the exact number of dyke strippers we’ll need, crushed or cubed ice, ya know) but for now, I just want you to go wild.  Slay me with party vibes, past, present and future.  Make shit up or tell me about  urlLink the time you did so much of whatever you wandered off and forgot you were at a party altogether.   This site should inspire those who read it to:  A)	Come to NYC on August 30th to party hard and help us say fuck you to Bush and          his cronies.  B)	Link/write about our efforts and hype shit up across the blogosphere  C)	Offer us money, resources, rides, etc.  What should you post here?  I don’t know.  Whatever comes to mind…song lyrics, nudie pix, gripes about the government, warblogger shit, blueprints for world domination.  BTW “Skullfuck Bush” is a working title…a jumping off point...k?  If more folks want to help and write for this, lemme know.  sterling.fassbinder@gmail.com  ready  steady   go   oh and I need  urlLink skylar’s  and  urlLink idea’s  email addys so I can add them to the “team”.  oh and one more thing…play nice…respect other folk’s links, template changes, etc…but an overall word of advice—don’t treat anything on here like it’s super permanent or sacred.  in other words  HAVE FFFFUN.

      "To laugh often and much; To win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; To earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; To appreciate beauty, to find the best in others; To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; To know that even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded."   Ralph Waldo Emerson   Sorry, George...

      I'm in a bad mood today.  I think it's because I haven't showered yet.   You know how you can feel on a hot day, when there's no water pressure to wash your hair good? Or on a cold day when there's not enough hot water for a good long bath?  A few years ago, I remember reading in   Soldier of Fortune   magazine a story about a medal being considered for certain types of valour.  You know, the kind of grown-up, shuthefuckup and suck it up type of fortitude that's so out of style these days. A medal for being able to go long periods without food, without sleep, without water, without complaining.   Rumor had it that it was scrapped when it was discovered that only non-white Americans were being considered as candidates.  I can dig it.   I spent the hottest part of every summer for many years on a reservation that would make Manzanar look like the  O.C . The running water was dependent on a well, which was dependent on a very iffy electricity system. If the electricity went out, no water.  If you wanted to throw something away, you burned or buried it.  You had to  pay  for things you hauled to the dump.  And, one of the reasons Vollman's   Unwashed Depressive  portrait so captured my imagination is because no matter how depressed I was, or how scarce the hot water, I made myself presentable every single day.  I went to middle-school dances groomed in nothing more than a half-cup of boiled water and some  urlLink  Dr. Bronner's.  Smoked those O.C. chicks, too. Self-respect.   "Attention to the lower parts is the first rule of self-respect "- Collette.  Now, imagine all the things you do to get pumped out of a lull.  I don't know about you, but I am one of those people who would have wanted that medal, and  I  am dependent on the grid to get myself up for the day ahead.  From the Zen-loke void of a post-espresso crap, to the hot shower and clean towel, to your hair drying just the right way, to the soundtrack morning music, what would we do without water and electricity?  Imagine going for months with no power.     urlLink  Literally.   Imagine sitting in your home too hot to move, with maybe just enough clean water for baby formula  or  to flush the toilet once, but not both. Imagine the hopelessness and proven psychological stress of prolonged heat. Picture pursuing your self-actualization with no reliable electricity or clean water.  I flatter myself...but I couldn't get my game on to look for a job under those conditions, let alone rebuild my poor bleeding country.   Last weekend, I went to an outdoor concert in 100+ degree heat. I paid to be there and it was still intense and brutal. And it got me thinking, what if our FUCK BUSH party were held under those conditions? How perky and sassy and kickass can you be when you feel power-less?       So, here's the deal; If you have to travel as far as I do to Bring The Beef, and if you're as broke as I am, you'll probably be feeling-not-so-fresh at the big FuckBushProm.  Do what my Catholic grandma used to call 'offering it up for a sacrifice'.  Represent.  Get your game face on like our missing party-people.  For every BTB-er who washes up in a bus depot, you are partying on behalf of a National Guardswoman burying used tampons in the desert.  For every hungover road-tripper showing up with a rockin' bedhead; a Gitmo detainee cleans up with baby wipes before seeing his wife for the first time in a year. Your perfect outfit wrinkled enroute? Shake your ass once or twice for the Iraqi mom boiling the same bandages over and over for her baby's wounds.  We are all in the same blood-filled gutter, looking at the stars.  Someone has to prime the pump to the well to wash it all away.  Dance yourself clean. Sweat like you're crying.  And remember- first round's on Fitz.

      Often I get the sense that I'me a bit misunderstood liberal leanings mixed with sensationalism lends itself to a sort of Michael-Moorism. Not that I disagree with protagonists,  after all I assume I am my own. Hola Raul!  Let's get certain things straight. I loved 12 Monkeys and Fight Club et al misanthropists have a certain sense or joie de vivre. I  on the other hand empathize with the agony and pathos of despair. This debasement and discomfiture is intuitive if you think about it.  I just saw  Sylvia  with that demure Paltrow (from what latin root?) and her blackness and love of her own shell was enlightening, so to speak.  Where  is  this going?  Oh yes yes the scotch. I should be getting to bed.

      sterling.fassbinder@gmail.com | Contacts | Settings | Help | Sign out     Show search options  Create a filter   Invite a friend to join Gmail!     dear  urlLink larry tee ,  hello, sir.  my name is sterling fassbinder.     i am twenty-six years old and i live uptown.  i used to live in Williamsburg where i went to your electroclash parties.  i found some of the music to be laughably retarded but the vibe was really a-1, my man.  i’ve got to give it up. and it’s not because i was loaded.  i went on the wagon at the very beginning of the scene and have managed to stay on it, one day at a time.    it was the junior high euro fag meets nyc punk vibe that drew me to those nights.  i liked the spaces and the chicks with the fluorescent tape on their tits.    (ha! that rhymed—"the spaces and the chicks with the florescent tape on their tits").  and the haircuts.  i’ve gotta say i was a sucker for those asymmetrical haircuts.  they brought me back to the days when we used to do it ourselves with safety scissors and then go jump in the pool.     you might have seen me at berliniamsburg--i was the boy dyke with bleached white blonde hair that’s sometimes slicked back in a pompadour.  i used to smoke cigarillos at the bar at luxx.  i remember how i freaked out one of the bartenders once, when i took off the glove on my right hand and he saw that i was missing two fingers.  i don’t blame him—it was late.  a lot had been going on…  at any rate, the point of my writing you now is the following—i want you to help me throw a party, but not just any party—a party to end all parties, a party at the end of time—a real new york breakabreaka dawn level event, with tons of kids of every kinda stripe in attendance.  it will be called “Skullfuck Bush” and it will be held during the republican national convention.  allow me to elaborate—i’ll try not to get too long-winded.  i know that your time is money.  if you couldn’t already tell, i’ve got mad respect for you.  i hope the European tour is going well, btw.  i write for a website that i helped start called  urlLink “More Reservoir Than Tarantino” , the purpose of which is to plan the ultimate underground shindig for what are surely going to be the most dogged out days of the entire dogged out summer--august.  we want to help reclaim new york—we want to use art and good times and debate and party hardying to ensure that the spirit of this place is not dampened when these snakes and liars hit town.  while not overtly political, i imagine the vibe of the event to be imbued with the spirit of rebellion.  i imagine a little decadence; i imagine a lot of laughing…  and here’s the other thing…these website compatriots of mine—we hope to make this an internet event as well.  or at least that seems to be one idea…please check out the site to see for yourself what we’re about. in turn, most of mrtt’s writers have their own sites…for instance, i write for another older site called  urlLink BRANDTRUEBOY .  that one’s run, iron-fist-dictator style, by my home girl, psycho druggie TRUEBOY.  mrtt is a democracy, but it’s the kind of democracy in which the parts aren’t obliged to play nicely with the whole.  in addition to planning the party, the point of mrtt is to provide an outlet for folks to vent about the world today.  it’s not specifically liberal or democrat.  it’s not a destination, a dictum or a set of directions.  rather, it’s a station on the way, filled with the echoing promise of multiple perspectives and debate and the changing of minds like the tearing of ticket stubs. the contributors are like states who can secede and war upon one another.  we also play fight with other “countries”, which is to say, TRUE and Raul Duke got us into a little something, something with the Rocky Mountain Alliance of conservative Christian blogs, but hell, it was all in good fun and no one got hurt.  the accidental genius of mrtt is that the folks writing for it all happen to be seasoned pyromaniacs—they love to start fires but they know how to put them out before any real damage occurs.  usually    another thing to point out about the party is that as there will be many bloggers in attendance, there will immediately be a myriad of versions of the “skullfuck bush” party, which will be posted onto a network of websites in the form of words, pictures, digital video…  …on t-shirts, bandannas, subway walls  …on fluorescent tape on girls’ boobies?  i come to you to ask for your invaluable expertise.  you started a completely viable and inspiring scene from scratch—please help us throw this party.  we need a place and we need a rolodex.  as for the former i was thinking carnivorously industrial—like that clock building in DUMBO—the one with all the artists’ studios.  or maybe a factory floor covered in sawdust in greenpoint.    too bad we couldn’t get the tunnel from back in the day…  (or an entire floor of a spick and span scrubbed steel and plastic midtown office after hours with all the lights bright yellow squares?)  please know that the ten or so of us who write for the site will be more than willing to do whatever it takes publicity wise to make this thing happen.  we’ll campaign tirelessly, and in several time zones…  from the Canadian cell including  urlLink raymitheminx ,  urlLink seany sean , and  urlLink brodie --  to san Francisco and miss  urlLink Angelina Deetox --  all the way through to the  urlLink United Bingdom  of the far east--  and  urlLink IDEA’s  motorcity--   urlLink (that walkswithfire)--    this is merely a sampling of the level of  urlLink talent  i’m bringing to this project.  please, tell us what to do.  (help us, obi wan, you are our only hope)  my email addy is sterling.fassbinder@gmail.com  or leave a comment on  urlLink More Reservoir Than Tarantino , where your visit will be most welcome and honored  of course you can also give me a call at 917. 8xx-2xxx.  Thank you for your time.

         So are we like allowed to write like random ass crapsterpiece kine shite in here now?  Not that anything that’s been written falls under said nom de plume, it’s just that the pressure to be political yet at the same time occupy area of that which is admired from afar weighs on me like a, like a, ah, fuck a metaphor.  Simile, sorry.  So, like, Bush.  Yah, fuck the guy.  Way up his butt.  Deeper than Atlantis.  I wish he’d go get a blowjob from some skanky whore and like call up a tabloid photographer and then, wait, no I don’t, cuz then he’d get reelected, cuz that’s what all the cool kids are doing.  Shit, that’s such a cliché.  My bad.  So, yah, I wanna see that Fahrenheit 911 movie even though I think I’ll get brainwashed by that fat fuck, but I’m ready for it.  I’ll drink some Bob’s Big Boy blue cheese dressing strait out the jar in honor of Ronnie ray-gun’s (yes I’m so clever) hair-do, and then I’ll be prepared for any eventuality of some thesis involving the side of spectrum whereby those that call rush Limbaugh a big fat idiot.  The truth is somewhere in between, but, hmmm, closer to, hmmm, space ghost.  Can’t remember.  I don’t know, John Kerry seems like a total dumbfuck pile of donkey shit to me, but yeah, he’s got my vote.  It sucks.  Cuz what else is there to do, vote for Nader?  Nah, I’d rather eat a shitload of ketchup, and you KNOW they’re gonna be pumping that shit, like, if it’s the other brand of ketchup they’re using at the DC commissary right now, you know, than the one that kerry’s wife is boss of, I wonder if they’ll switch it.  They need a watchdog committee to fukn verify that shit and send a thousand of red ants down that bitch’s throat if it comes true.  Nah, that would be overboard.  Fuck this shit I’m outtah heah.  Word to all your mothers.

(does smoking drugs count as ingesting?)  anyway  in my humble opinion i think that the less prolific members of this site (i.e., the ones on that little list down there who have yet to post even the tiniest tidbit) should be given the boot in the super near future if they can't manage to get the led hard on their pencil.  i mean, like any kick ass party you've gotta do a little WERK...whaddya you guys and gals think?  speaking of which...wtf is up with  urlLink mr. tony pierce ?  his invite has been sent several times to his gmail account, with nary a response, although he left-linked us on the busblog.  thx, luv, but what's with the dis?  i mean, yeah, you're busy (but who isn't?) and yeah you get a thousand hits a day but what's a thousand hits in the scheme of things?  six digits, baby, then you can officially start snuffing others.  but a thousand...shit, for what that's worth you might as well have OUR stats.  heh.  see dick flame.  see dick incur the wrath of his fellow contributors and see dick rake in the hateful comments and sink into an acute depression.  seriously, though, i'm not hatin on the man.  TRUE offered  urlLink tp  the peace pipe a while back and you know i'm all about peace.  and pipes.  i'm just trying to do my part...tryin to push us forward.  tony's a man of the people and i'd be honored to serve on the same hunk of web real estate as him.  mmmmmmmm.....hunks....  i can't help it, i get so horny when i smoke...but it's all good, as i'm sure my newfound freeform christian friends would agree--god gave us all the plants to USE...yes, my children, you lucky fucking souls who are reading/participating, planning/fantabulating, manhandling/masturbating...consider yourself blessed, heads and shoulders above the REST as you're here at the BEGINNING, at the making of the motto (which is no longer 'fuck tomorrow')...you guys are witnessing the holy sanctioning of the skullfuck bush battle cry as it simultaenously becomes a fable and a way of life, a fight for your oh so precious RIGHTzzzzzzzzz    i dedicate this puff to the power of greyskull!!!!!!!!!     blog title of the week urlLink --"rockandrollmeansfuck" ...some decent stuff...went there from  urlLink anti's  site...now THERE's a man i'd like to meat...i mean MEET.   when is he going to write for us?

      Okay, the Iraq handover is getting better planning than the SkullFuck Bush tea-dance.   So, que onda?  This thing is set to happen in less than two months, and it's still in the finger-fucking stage.  I took it upon myself to invite a few folks.  First, I sent an e-mail to Mr.  urlLink  Morning Fix  - he's PoMo like a mofo, but he has what used to be called 'wet dream demographics'.  There's the NYC Craigslist, which I brought up before, but they didn't like the words 'Fuck' or 'kill'- (and I'm still working on a press release to beat the Gold Standard,   Sean's   weblog link, May 29).  These people look pretty intense ,but if they were planning a urlLink  week in    my   town,  I'd invite them.    MRTT is now on the official NYC Regional  Edition of the Burning Man Events Letter, urlLink  Afterglow   . Not exactly a hip-hop crowd, but they know how to party with a vengeance and a conscience. They also have good drugs.  That's all I could think of for now.   It was the least I could do. And I always do the least I can do.  Now what? Ferris? Anybody?  P.S.-  Jeroen, Wat denk u Nederlandse von ons Americannen ?

       urlLink because he made apache helicopters?   wtf kind of logic are they using?  because they don't like the u.s. being in their country and they want the saudi government to release some prisoners, they think they're justified in cutting off this poor guy's head?  it's only by making the kind of gigantic interprative leap common to fanaticism that such retribution makes sense.    not coincidentally, michael moore makes a similarly logic defying claim in bowling for columbine when he tries to infer that the proximity of missle building factories to columbine high school had something to do with what went on there.  we see stock footage of initmidating war nuclear heads juxtaposed with everyday shots, meant to make us understand that a nihilistic vibe was thick in that area.   he doesn't bother with any actual statistics regarding teen violence in the many other american towns and cities who play host to the various franchises of the defense industry.  who needs numbers or third party reports when you present your images as some kind of raw truth, the way only a documentarian can?  the only problem is, bowling for columbine is not a documentary in the tradition of letting the subject do the talking.  in bowling for columbine the subject is a  thesis , a certain interpretation of events and not the events themselves.  don't get me wrong.  i DID really like looking for roger, or whatever his flint, michigan movie was called.  he let the town do the talking without pandering to them, and managed, for the most part, to keep the suffocating weight of his moral agenda out of the picture.  not so with bowling for columbine.    we'll see what happens with the next one.  yeah, i'm going to see it--unlike the passion of the blood drenched christ i dont' feel as bad forking over 10 bucks for mm.

      Mary, over at the Left Coaster, begs the question,  urlLink "Why would Americans believe that Iraq was behind 9/11? Especially when the Bush apologists state that Bush never, ever said that?"   Atrios 'touched on it' a little bit yesterday when  urlLink Condi Rice once again perpetuates the doubt by getting all semantic on the issue .    "What I believe the 9-11 commission was opining on was operational control, an operational relationship between al Qaeda and Iraq which we never alleged," Rice said in an interview with National Public Radio.  "The president simply outlined what we knew about what al Qaeda and Iraq had done together. Operational control to me would mean that he (Saddam) was, perhaps, directing what al Qaeda would do."   Will they stop with this? Do they wonder why so many Americans believe Saddam had something to do with 9/11? any connection between them not letting that suspicion die.  I am getting so despondent that I can't even talk about politics anymore, then I overindulge myself on busy news days because it possesses my brain like meningitis and wind up working myself into a tazmanian devil spinout.   Last Friday I was interviewed by some chick from 99.3 WNYC outside the WTC. She was asking me questions like, "What does it mean to be informed?" and stuff like "Where should people be getting their news from?" and more specific stuff about what I dislike about what's going on in politics. Is she serious? Seriously? ME? Do I like what's going on? What stuff?  And I fucking blanked. I was all, "you know, Geneva Conventions, lies, Bush." this was after I had written  urlLink this ,  urlLink this ,  urlLink this , and  urlLink this  that same damn day.   So now I'm pissed off. In the last month I've been in the actual presence of Bush Voters, past and future. I'm getting into these arguments, heated but civil, and I am so fucking scatterbrained I sound like an idiot. But at least I know how to pronounce the words that come out of my mouth Georgie. What do I learn from all of this. Be silent, stare condescendingly and emanate utter incense. If I had the ability to make my eyes turn red, would I ever stop using it? you could call me prejudiced  urlLink jaundice  man and I would have scabies to boot, for effect. wait... what's worse (or funnier) scabies or shingles?  Edginess and arteriosclerosis go hand in heart these days. do you have plaque on your walls? talk about hypertension!  So. Fuck it. Take action. Speak loudly and bang your drums boy. yea gods bang em hard.  urlLink     :-(   Posted by  urlLink Hello

        The following excerpts are taken from, and  urlLink "copyleft"   urlLink Wikipedia    urlLink History of the United States 1980-1988    - By the middle of 1983, unemployment fell from 11 percent in 1982 to 8.2 percent in the middle of 1983. GDP growth was 3.3 percent, the highest since the mid-1970s. Inflation was below 5 percent. GDP growth, however, obscured increasingly uneven distribution of income, growing poverty, and falling real wages for the bottom half of income earners.   Now, I am don't know how old any of you folks are, but I am 23. I was born in 1981, and my parents felt first-hand the effects of Reaganomics and the ' uneven distribution of income, growing poverty, and falling real wages for the bottom half of income earners'. It was incredibly difficult to raise a child in the early 80's, especially for lower, middle class people without a college education.      - Following the mild recovery (which occurred in time for Reagan's 1984 reelection bid), the medium-term effect of reaganomics was a soaring budget deficit as spending exceeded revenue year after year due to tax cuts and increased defense spending. Military costs rose while tax revenues failed to increase.   How this military and "defense" spending translates into being against "Big Government", I'll never know.      - In his first term, Reagan kept demanding increases to the defense budget of up to 10 percent a year. Congressional committees, meanwhile, investigated charges that the $1 trillion of U.S. military spending in Reagan's first term bought surprisingly little, pointing to alleged Pentagon mismanagement. In the 1980s, for example, nearly 50 of the largest U.S. defense contractors came under investigation for overcharges and other criminal malfeasance.   All of this, an Reagan is still held in saintly regard by Republicans all across the nation. It seems to me that people, politicians and Republicans would rather view him in an idyllic manner than in a realistic fashion.     - The 1981 tax cuts, the largest in U.S. history, also eroded the revenue base of the federal government in the short-term. The massive increase in military spending (about $1.6 trillion over five years) far exceeded cuts in social spending, despite wrenching impact of such cuts spending geared toward some of the poorest segments of society. Even so, by the end of 1985, funding for domestic programs had been cut nearly as far as Congress could tolerate.   The lasting effects of these cuts stay with us even today.   In this context, the deficit rose from $60 billion in 1980 to a peak of $220 billion in 1986 (well over 5 percent of GDP). Over this period, the national debt more than doubled from $749 billion to $1,746 billion.   - While deficit spending has value as an economic stimulus, and while it did counter-act the recession of 1982, the dimension of the budget shortfalls of the 1980s left interest rates high and the dollar over-valued, causing investment and exports to suffer.  - Since U.S. saving rates were very low (roughly one-third of Japan's), the deficit was mostly covered by borrowing from abroad, turning the United States within a few years from the world's greatest creditor nation to the world's greatest debtor. Not only was this damaging to America's status, it was also a profound shift in the postwar international financial system, which had relied on the export of U.S. capital.    - The deficits were keeping interest rates, although lower than the 20 percent peak levels earlier in the administration due to a respite in the administration's tight money policies, high and threatening to push them higher. The government was thus forced to borrow so much money to pay its bills that it was driving up the price of borrowing. Although supply-siders promised increased investment as a result of top-rate and corporate tax cuts, growth and investment suffered for now in the context of high interest rates.   - Perhaps more alarmingly, Reagan-era deficits were keeping the U.S. dollar overvalued. With such a high demand for dollars (due in large measure to government borrowing), the dollar achieved an alarming strength against other major currencies. As the dollar soared in value, so American exports became increasingly uncompetitive, with Japan as the leading beneficiary. The high value of the dollar made it difficult for foreigners to buy American goods and encouraged Americans to buy imports, coming at a high price to the industrial export sector.    - The U.S. balance of trade grew increasingly unfavorable; the trade deficit grew from $20 billion to well over $100 billion. Thus, American industries such as automobiles and steel, faced renewed competition abroad and within the domestic market as well.   - While Reagan was in office, charges of an executive "power vacuum" and a low presidential attention span were probably not entirely partisan in nature. Some fiscal conservatives and Democrats criticized Reagan for the extent of deficit spending, often focusing on the lack of oversight of defense expenditures. In January 1985 prominent conservative columnist William Safire, alluding to George H.W. Bush's charges that Reagan was advocating "voodoo economics" in the 1980 race for the GOP nomination, stated in The New York Times Magazine that "Reaganomics is giving voodoo a bad name" and that the "United States has lost control of its financial markets to foreigners."   - In 1982 the CIA organized and financed rightwing paramilitaries in Nicaragua. The tracing of secret funds for this scheme led to the revelations of the Iran-Contra Affair. In 1985 Reagan authorized the sale of arms in Iran in an unsuccessful effort to free U.S. hostages in Lebanon; he later professed ignorance that subordinates were illegally diverting the proceeds to Central American contras.   This and other situations, including but not limited to the invasion of Grenada, The Strategic Defense Initiative and the Marine Barracks Bombing in Beirut leave me with a bitter taste in my mouth.  All of these things would kinda make me mistrust any politician that calls himself a "Reagan Republican". Hey, go ahead and take that title, but I don't think it's quite the badge of courage people think it is.   This isn't even touching the other internal struggles that afflicted the US while Ronnie ran the show. I don't even think that shit needs to be touched on, as it's been well discussed in this forum and others. The fact of the matter is, Reagan wasn't that great, and not nearly good enough to be on the fucking ten dollar bill. For other politicians to model themselves after his political career and *ahem* achievements makes me giggle.   I find myself living in a country where I cannot afford to take care of my basic needs as a human being. I have no insurance, I can't afford housing, jobs suck, pay is small and inadequate, schooling is so expensive it's not even a thought and I can't get a job that is good unless I go to school for four years. Even then, the economy is flooded with college graduates who can't find work in their field.  I have a friend who's 27 years old and works a job making $7.50 an hour.  He lives at home.  He has a DOCTORATE in English.  And his current situation is not because he's lazy.    urlLink Welcome to America   urlLink Fuck Bush

         hey, guys.  I know that most of the reaction to the sitemeter has been less than positive, so I thought I’d make a quick post illustrating one of its benefits—tracking back to conservative sites that link to us and finding out what they’re saying.  As you know,  urlLink TRUE ,  urlLink N8  and this dude  urlLink David  started  urlLink some shit  with them the other week.  All three were banned and most of their comments removed.  urlLink IDEA  was involved as well,  urlLink writing what I thought was an excellent, temperate response post  to an anti-gay marriage post on one of the sites involved.  If you really feel like confronting these folks (which TRUE sounds serious about doing), than I think the latter approach is the way to go, as IDEA’s post and comments could be in no way construed as an attack or trolling.  (of course, I’m not getting involved because I know my limits—and I’ve got absolutely nothing to say to small-minded, bigoted bible thumpers who want to undo the separation between church and state and impose their homophobic laws on me.)  Regardless, I thought y’all might be interested to  urlLink read them slamming sweet and lovely Sahalie on Rocky Mountain Alliance  for her post about the national day of mourning proposed for Reagan’s funeral.  The idiot who posts it refers to this as a good example of a troll.  Sorry, chum, but a troll is someone who comes over to your site trying to start shit.  See  urlLink here .   urlLink Sahalie  merely  urlLink posted her thoughts on this site .  If you want to call anyone a troll, call TRUE or N8 or David a troll, although, from what I saw from their comments before they were deleted, they were mostly in the form of polite questions regarding the brainwashed bullshit laid out by these holier than thou patriots.    They go on to publish whatever IP addresses they have, as though it means something. ( Interestingly enough, they don’t mention TRUE or list her IP.)  God, they are so horny for us, it’s sad.  Someone named Joshua Sharf says, “I don't know whether to be relieved or insulted that I haven't been hit,” to which  urlLink Guy of Damascus Road  (who obviously thinks he’s some kind of big daddy to this crew) responds, “Joshua...'Just you wait Henry Higgins! Just you wait!' Methinks "your time is a comin". Just link to their sight with an inflammatory consevative statement. Ha!”    MMMM.  Tasty. This is our country, folks.  Bourgeois and biblical.  It’s a nice touch that he misspelled conservative, though.  And they call us stupid.

         so, yeah, this site is the shit, if I do say so myself.  we’re a pundit site without the pundits.  a lefty site written with the right hand  (and a conservative site written with my left foot)  we’re the one-eyed author writing for the blind  a comic book without the comics  (thought bubbles, man, it’s all about the  thought bubbles )  we’re a rock n’ roll band without the music…  religious fervor without the religion  our mission is to put the party back in partisan.  the con back in convention  the fuck back in bush…  right?  mmmmk?  y’all with me?  well, the time has come to close the deal and make it real and get a VENUE.  it’s kinda like we’re homeless right now and looking fer a job—  you can’t get a job without an address and you can’t get an address without a job  we need to create some hype in order to get a venue but we need a venue to really get some HYPE.  for instance, here’s what happened when I tried to post our non-located event on  urlLink CounterConvention.org .  (basically, i just copy and pasted  urlLink the first post  i published on this site):    Your recent Event posted at Counter Convention ([Wednesday, Sep 01 @ 10:00 PM] Skullfuck Bush:  MRTT presents &quot;The Party @ the End of Time&quot;) has been reviewed by a moderator, but looks like it needs editing to be approved for the site.  The reviewing moderator provided the following comments:  -------------------------------- Thanks for posting your event on CounterConvention.org. Unfortunately, I can't approve this post until you have a confirmed space. Once you have a space confirmed, then you can edit the post and re-submit it.  Also - unless this is specifically a queer event, I think mentioning "dyke strippers" is inappropriate. --------------------------------  Please edit and resubmit your post on-line at:  http://www.counterconvention.org/lightningbug/index.php?action=detail&mode=edit&hash=QU0yqe..Max&listing=340  You have until Thursday, Jun 10 @ 04:23 PM to clean up the post before it is discarded.  Counter Convention has a content policy which can be reviewed at:  http://www.counterconvention.org/index.php?name=content_policy  Thanks for posting at Counter Convention!      makes sense and all, although the bit about how mentioning “dyke strippers” might be “inappropriate” got me thinking…despite our need for hype, we shouldn’t just indiscriminately advertise this par-ty.  I mean, we aren’t going to be…polite…like the other protests/demonstrations.  aren’t we kinda asking for it if we post all the details for all the world (and all the pigs) to see?  should we try and play this thing like a rave and email each other the info in the form of riddles and jokes?  or maybe we should just tell everyone to come and send em on a treasure hunt throughout the city to gather clues as to the venue?    personally, I think we should start with the motherboards.  I’m (still) trying to come up with the fabulous first post that’s going to drum up tons of interest for our she-bang among the nyc nightlife glitterati.  it’s gotta be short and sweet and attention grabbing and somehow tell folks what we’re about…and since this is a GROUP site I’m turning it over to you,  el groupo especial  to help me come up with the piece.  which reminds me of an overarching point that I wanted to make—some of y’all have been emailing me, asking when and where the party is…well, your excitement is infectious but let me just make it clear—i ain’t the  jefe  of this operation.  I know as much as you guys do.  we’re all in this together, mr. pink, mr. brown, mr. black, mr. TRUEBLUE whoever…  so let’s make some decisions:  first—let’s get some drafts for the motherboards post(s)  second—let’s think of some possible hot spots to hold this thang.    third—let’s decide how public we want the info to be…do we want this to be on DL raver girl style or are we putting stickers on every lamppost like it’s the beasties album?   make some noise make some noise make some noise make some NOISE.     oh yeah, there's a sitemeter on the bottom now...can someone volunteer to keep watch over it?  i'll send you the pwd and whatnot.  maybe you can post some of the funnier searches or referrals or whatever.  also, another reminder...you are ALL ADMINZ.  so admin away, i'll say it again--I'M NOT THE BOSS AROUND HERE.  no one is, hence the title...getitgotitGOOD.

         So, how are everyone's travel plans going?  Anybody coming from the Miwok Rez territory? Time to circle the wagons.  Carpool  and  caravan  are such lame-ass words for such a  urlLink  revolutionary act .    urlLink   N8   , you're right. Americans are a metaphor for fat slow cars blocking up the fast lane. Our idea of activity runs a short gamut of filling up a cart with crap at K-Mart, to  asshole-to-armpit channel surfing from  Man Show  reruns to that tornface cow Coulter on  FOXNews , and back.   No wonder we only feel real bumping along to mass bass in a bigass car.   Unless you count sitting alone in front of free Internet porn .  Never mind both trips are equally as self-limiting as the blind mule turning a mill wheel, or a fattening chicken amok in a stony hen-run.     Okay,I'm picking you up, so be ready. Get in the car. Hit the road. Budge up and make room, and get off my map.Quit fighting back there, kids. If you drink all that you're going to want to pee, and I'm not stopping.   Who are you going as? Where will you stay? Do you have a bail bondsman, firstaid kit, digital camera, Hitachi wand?   Whether we find ourselves at the Skullfuck Bush Soiree, or anywhere else, at least we're not all asleep at the wheel anymore.   We're not on the road to nowhere and running like hell to get there.  (C'mon, what do you people want from me on my last hour of overtime, Michel Foucault? Christ.)  Oh, and since it hasn't been said here in awhile -  FUCK BUSH .

         Excuse me while I talk a bunch of bullshit, but the state of the world today, um, oh fuck, fuck the state of the world today, it’s all about if I’m getting the proper dosage of ovaltine to get me through to that next exciting episode of the price is right.  So here in Hawaii it’s kamehameha day as well as Ronnie ray-gun day, so two dictators for the price of one.  For those that don’t know  urlLink king kamehameha  was, as you probably deduced by this point of the sentence, a king in Hawaii, not just a king, the king, the one that first united all the islands.  Which is extremely relevant in that a writer with more wherewithal to make an actual point would draw various parallels between the only actual monarchy that ever occurred on US soil and the allegorical monarchy taking place at Pennsylvania avenue and then you could like even go farther on with it and commentate on how george w bush (he being primarily and numerologically skullfucked in these hallowed holy environs) is the direct descendent politically of Ronald Reagan especially in his zeal to remake the world in his image, the whole getting by with a smile and a wink and looking like an idiot montage applies as well.  Sooo, that’s just to say that here out in the outer west are doubled up on holidays honoring falling despots but at the same time I am somehow here still at werk, doing the herkie jerk.  You know, with dr. dirk?  I did get free parking though.

       “My life seems to be an increasing revelation of the intimate face of universal struggle. You begin with your family and the kids on the block, and next you open your eyes to what you call your people, and that leads you into land reform into Black English into Angola leads you back to your own bed where you lie by yourself, wondering if you deserve to be peaceful, or trusted or desired or left to the freedom of your own unfaltering heart. And the scale shrinks to the size of a skull: your own interior cage.   And then if you’re lucky, and I have been lucky, everything comes back to you .And then you know why one of the freedom fighters in the sixties, a young Black woman interviewed shortly after she was beaten up for riding near the front of the interstate bus––you know why she said, ‘We are all so very happy’? It’s because it’s on. All of us and me by myself: we’re on."   from the foreword to Civil Wars, 1980, by June Jordan copyright © 1980 June Jordan

         So yah, fuck, I don’t know whut to say really, lots of retarded shit floating through my mental as usual. Reading the time mag article on ronnie ray-gun, and, well, I still aint gonna call him evil incarnate but I’m not running out and buying his commemerative bumper sticker neither, so you can let that lead you to whatever opinion of my politics of that which you will. Homey had an effect. Before him, we were, how do you say? Fucked up. No guts no glory. Just a bunch of poon doggers hanging our heads in our onion dip. Ok I am officially done with that topic. Yeah he was super ignorant of some stuff and he laughed at bob hope’s fucked up aids joke about the statue of liberty, but fuck, listen to fresh prince & dj jazzy jeff’s first album sometime. “all y’all out there that got AIDS, be quiet,” am I the only one that remembers that? Ok and yah, that was ray-gun’s fault maybe for trivializing it, and poisoning society's views, but, hey it was the common perception and ronnie ray was the common man, I mean, shit, he was the gipper! and can one man be that powerful, does one man's lack of speech on a topic therefore make him responsible for a nation full of homophobes and non-caring individuals? a point could be made either way and prolly has been made all ways. FUCK, stop editing this shit keith, you are done, it is 11:06, and the dishes are NOT done, this ain't black belt jones, you can't just shoot them. Yah, but fuck ronnie. serially though, i know my logic line is fucked up, but i'm not trying to like justify inequitudes vis a vis calling out will smith and trying to compare, even though i am, if you could see in my head, maybe it would all make sense, fuck, would be nice if someone could sort it out. what's your hourly rate? i gotta couch and everything, and like notepads you could draw on while you pretend to listen to me. think about it. anyway, edit #2 over.

         If it takes me a week to decide whether or not I have anything to say on this Bush Fuckery, does that mean I don't?  Does anyone else have some  uuuuggggglllllyyy  memories regarding parties? Show of hands? I'll go first.  I could always do without other people easier than anyone I knew.  Teenagers hate this. Especially girls. Parties were hell.  Concerts were tolerable because I went alone.    I was always the only girl in my milieu who had ever even  heard  of the bands I wanted to see, so I got used to going alone. Then I preferred it. Then a funny thing happened- I got asked backstage. There was always a party going on, but  urlLink  the    urlLink  people   I wanted to hang with were always alone, too.   There is always at least one member of a band who wants to hook up with an attractive fellow Voluntary Hermit for a mutual communion of silence. There's at least one in every group like us. We love you all. We appreciate the music as much as you. We want to party, at least in the abstract. We just aren't very into it.  So that's the kind of guest I am. Invite me, and I always come. Or go.   The last night I went to that tired old bar the Odyssey, I was dragged by friends who found my isolation insulting. "Let's just go. Maybe you'll meet a guy, or run into some old friends."   As the car passed the DuPar's sign,I knew I wanted to be home alone drinking Pernod and staring at the wall. Inside the Odyssey the music was horrible, the vibe cold, and I ditched everyone. I heard footsteps behind me as I walked outside. I thought it was Orion, running away from the music over my head.   I was so sick of being alive, tired of everybody I knew, that I hardly noticed when some dude exuding speed sweat grabbed me . He threw me against a parked car in an awkwardly romantic way. His blue eyes went dreamy when he described how he would stuff dirt in my vagina and mouth after he killed me because I wasn't acting scared enough  I asked myself what I thought was happening.   "This is rape", I said. "What?" came a comical voice from inside the car we were struggling against.  It was a friend I had lost touch with,a Mod who worked at Bonwit Teller. He was crying against the chest of another mutual friend. He had waited two years to talk to a boy who had just rejected him.   He got out and sniffed me.  "That's the same perfume my sister uses". Thus did I become a person, and not an incipient victim. And my attacker let me go.  He meandered away as if waking up from a nap.   Mod Dude and I had a cigarette together, watching the scene literally dissolve.  Rapist Dude broke character and ambled onto one of the busses chugging through the city full of East L.A. natives who had never seen the beach. I looked back up at the nightclub, and wondered what did I think was in  that  for me? The stories are out  here . "What happened?", asked Mod Dude.  "I met a guy and ran into some old friends", I said.   There is always the truth behind the facts, like the real Forrest Gump said.  So when someone gets in my face about prison torture photos, or the Nick Berg snuff film, I think, okay that's what happened. But what really happened? Who were those people before they became propaganda-objects?   Who knows the stories of the   urlLink  innocents   who die alone, despised for not acting scared enough?   And TRUE, and Sterling are goddamn right about not wanting to be victims. If you can look around and say "This is rape", you're no longer prey. Not what  anybody  else will try and make you.  So uuuhhh, yeah, topic.  I always show up where I'm invited,and I hate to come empty-handed. Hit the bell with your elbow, you know.  If I can bring anything to this party, I can find, listen to, and remember the stories. The off-center points. The opposite of truth in Greek isn't untruth, but oblivion. So I guess my place at this thing will be the equvialent of the guy getting cried on in that car. The person who hears and sees the stories of how you got to the party.  So, hermits and lurkers? I feel you, and I want to see you there too.   "...Ma's eyes passed Rose of Sharon's eyes, and then came back to them. And the two women looked deep into each other. The girl's breath came short and gasping.       She said, "Yes".      Ma smiled. "I knowed you would. I knowed it!"  ....Rose of Sharon loosened one side of the blanket and bared her breast. ...She looked up and across the barn and smiled mysteriously."                                     - John Steinbeck  Grapes of Wrath    I was right. I don't have anything to say.

      So my boss rolled his eyes when he told me to take Friday off because it's a national day of mourning for that grease-haired grease-palmed icon of ineptitude who recently died. I asked him if we had Friday off so that we could go to the grave and stomp the dirt down, make sure that soul destined for an eternity of torment doesn't escape to some secluded clearing in the hills of Guatemala where there once was a town. He laughed and said stomp away, stomp away. I suppose that raper of our constitution and economic shithead was good for something.   Arlo Guthrie once during Reagan's second term said he knew people were concerned with the president taking naps, sleeping all the time, particularly during times of crisis such as we had in the 1980s. But Arlo said he didn't mind, because when the president is napping, we know exactly where he is. And in fact, if we could get all the presidents from all over the world sleeping, and sleeping together, then they could be doing to each other what they've been doing to us.   Have a fun Friday.

         Greetings, children.  Easing into the mrtt style of blog-hopping across partisan lines, I followed a link on  urlLink Ultra B’s  site to  urlLink “The Right Side of the Rainbow”  in which the poster cites the following from  urlLink “Hog On Ice”,  whose author argues that the early spread of AIDS was a consequence of personal, and not presidential (ir)responsibility:   “The AIDS epidemic is one of the dumber things the left has tried to blame on Republicans. It's not like Ronald Reagan flew around infecting people. People infected each other, and once we knew the cause of AIDS and how to avoid spreading it, they kept right on infecting each other, and now we live in a time where almost every American who has AIDS got it by doing something he or she knew better than to do.”   If you go to  urlLink the site , you’ll see the comment I left regarding this shocking bit of pseudo-logic.  How high and mighty do you have to think you are to point the finger at AIDS victims and say, “you deserved it”?  Seriously, does it get any more hateful than that?  And no, it doesn’t make a difference that the author is a gay man who lived through the crisis, except that you should really look into what made you so self hating, sweetie. At any rate, while Googling on this subject, I came across  urlLink this well written piece  which expounds upon the myriad ways in which Reagan’s silence worsened the plight of early AIDS victims and helped allow the disease to spread.  In addition to the financial facts (doctors at the Center for Disease Control asking for funds for AIDS work and being refused, or that in ’81 one million dollars was spent on AIDS research compared to eight million spent on Legionnaire’s Disease) the author outlines the ways in which Reagan pandered to his far right power base by keeping quiet and letting them do all the talking—homophobic, misinformed, talking, that is.   Among other scandalous statements is William F. Buckley’s shot at being at the bottom of the barrel, when he argued that HIV positive drug users should be tattooed as such across their arms and HIV positive gay men across their buttocks.  This was said in America, folks.  The same country that brings you life, liberty and the pursuit of queers through cornfields, where they’ll get their skull kicked in before being crucified on a fence and left to die.  The same country in which one of its greatest innovations—the separation of church and state—is constantly under attack by extremists of every stripe, who would like to see their moral code supercede all others, despite the fact that it would undermine the integrity of the constitution, the exact document that ensures them the right to practice whatever it is they believe, however “out there” it might be.  Yes, the same country that elects buffoons for president who regularly “out” their asshole selves in front of members of the international community, as in this example from  urlLink the aforementioned piece  on the deadly consequences of Reagan’s silence:   I told one of my students that the most memorable Reagan AIDS moment for me was at the 1986 centenary rededication of the Statue of Liberty. The Reagans were there sitting next to French President Francois Mitterand and his wife, Danielle. Bob Hope was on stage entertaining the all-star audience. In the middle of a series of one-liners Hope quipped, "I just heard that the Statue of Liberty has AIDS but she doesn't know if she got it from the mouth of the Hudson or the Staten Island Fairy." As the television camera panned the audience, the Mitterands looked appalled. The Reagans were laughing. By the end of 1989 and the Reagan years, 115,786 women and men had been diagnosed with AIDS in the United States, and more than 70,000 of them had died.    Cheers, dears…First round’s on me in August…

      I just want to share this with everyone, even though it's a little off-topic. This is from the Joliet Herald, a newspaper from my local suburbs. This is just crazy.     Romeoville man may be sent back to Rwanda   Genocide suspect: Mudahinyuka may soon face international war crimes charges    By Natasha Korecki  SPECIAL TO THE HERALD NEWS    A Romeoville man suspected in Rwandan atrocities might be transferred to the African nation to answer war crimes allegations — even before local customs-related charges are resolved, a U.S. State Department official suggested Tuesday.  "It's still up in the air, but there is a possibility for the department to step in before the prosecution runs its course," said the State Department official, who did not want to be named.   For now, though, the U.S. Attorney's office in Chicago is moving ahead with its case against Thierry Rugamba, whose real name, according to authorities, is Jean-Marie Vianney Mudahinyuka.  Rugamba pleaded not guilty Tuesday to making false statements to gain entry into the United States, and to assaulting federal agents during his arrest last week.  He also has agreed to turn over a blood sample.  Rugamba allegedly bit the hand of a customs agent during the raid, and U.S. District Court Judge Edward Bobrick ordered Rugamba last Friday to submit to a blood test to see if he infected the agent in any way.  Rugamba initially refused. But his attorney, Gabe Plotkin, said Tuesday there was "some confusion" and Rugamba would now submit to a test.   Prosecutors say Rugamba hurt another agent during the arrest by hitting him in the head with the agent's shotgun barrel.  If convicted on the local charges, Rugamba could spend up to 35 years in prison.  Prosecutors contend Rugamba is a fictitious name given to an immigration officer as a way to get into the U.S. under claims he was a refugee.   Authorities believe he is Mudahinyuka, who was believed to be part of an elite group of Hutu militia that ordered and took part in the killings of more than 500,000 Tutsis.  Rugamba cited the 5th Amendment on Tuesday when asked in court to state his name.  Mudahinyuka is wanted by the Rwandan government on an international war crimes warrant.    That's really fucked up, but here is an even better article on the  urlLink arrest , and here's one on the  urlLink actual event .

      I was reading over some old posts in this site and clicked a link to  urlLink this site . Being the son of a born again father, the content wasn't new but the medium - finding a place where I could discuss it online rather than in an emotive family dinnertable debate - seems more civil. Guy was good enough to respect my comments and respond in the form of a post. I've taken some time to think about what he's said and return the gesture.   My initial question was along the lines of "Why is what goes on behind closed doors between two  adults any of the Christian church's business?"   * * *     To understand my position, you must first understand that I am a Christian, and as such, believe that every word in the Bible is true and God inspired.   We should be careful not to associate &quot;true&quot; with &quot;God inspired&quot;. One doesn't imply the other; acts of terror can be &quot;God inspired&quot; as well as acts of charity. To say that you've been 'inspired' implies a subjective perception, an interpretation. Actions, writings, thoughts are all subjective even if inspired by the &quot;truth&quot; itself. The only objective truth is logic - totally independent of faith.  Our Lord specifically addresses the sin of homosexuality in multiple places in the Bible: Lev. 18:22, Lev.20:13, I Cor.6:9-10, and Rom.1 26-28.   I understand that yours is a Christian/Conservative website and it's not my intent to [even try to] undermine your faith and belief in scripture. My intent is, however, to understand why you think Christian doctrine should dictate the law in this country. I think that Christianity needs to support claims without citation of Biblical passages in order to maintain any credibility in a supposedly secular arena. Many gays/&quot;sinners&quot; are of no religious faith or call God by a different name; on what ground will you meet them? These are the basis of your belief and even non-Christians should respect that, but when such passages are the cornerstones of prejudice and social inequality I think that they should be re-examined. Essentially, if your notion of God is effecting unloving actions - it's time to reassess.   An entirely different discussion altogether, but Christian thinkers since Augustine have stated that the Judeo Christian God is by definition the highest level of logic and / equivalent to pure love. On that basis alone I think Christians can make a viable, more socially acceptable argument for it's position without citing antiquated, obscure passages that are irrelevant to non-Christians. Logic is the only objective truth. Telling tax-paying gays they can't be married and receive the same social benefits as their heterosexual neighbor because you (the Christian) have  faith  in an otherwise unsupported passage from a 2,000 year old text is unjust - particularly in a secular society.    Also, please understand that while condemning the act of homosexuality as sin, I consider myself a sinner saved by grace and therefore, no better or no worse than any other individual. The sin in the life of the practicing homosexual is no less or no greater than the sin in my life. God’s grace is extended to all those that would receive it.  Labeling oneself as a sinner doesn't exonerate you in condemning others, especially when they're not of your faith. This statement reminds me of someone making a racist joke then saying &quot;but, I have a lot of black friends&quot;. Christians believe that we're born of sin, how does this pertain to gay marriage?    In that it is a statistically proven fact that there is a higher rate of STD (AIDS for one), higher rate of suicide, and a higher crime rate (specifically, crimes against persons) in the homosexual community, it is not too great a leap to say that society, in general, is affected by this sinful lifestyle.  In a society where &quot;fag&quot; and &quot;queer&quot; are slanders for feminine and &quot;soft&quot; men, I find this very hard to believe. If there is a high crime rate (specifically, crimes against persons) it's the hate crimes of conservatives  against  gay persons. And a quick Google™ search for &quot;high crime rate homosexual community&quot; returned little evidence of your statement. In fact, the first listing that came up was  urlLink your own site  (strangely, it was followed by listings for "White Nationalist" websites. . . ?). Nothing on BBC or MSNBC or CNN. . .  Further down the listings, however - I did find this. (Excerpt from  urlLink here ).    Homosexuality is the world's oldest deviance, but tolerance and constitutional protections have been gained in recent years.&nbsp; Homosexuals, like most minority groups, suffer the pains of stigma and stereotype for the faults of a few members.&nbsp;  Their overall culture of secrecy (closet homosexuality) probably creates more problems than it's worth, however.&nbsp; It sets up a situation for blackmail and a marketplace atmosphere of clubs and parks where anonymity breeds abuse.   I don't think it would be a far stretch to examine the social inequalities that might effect this. With one in three African American males being in some phase of the correctional process, would you say it's a sin to be Black? How does your statement support your claim? How does high crime in the homosexual community equate to homosexuality being wrong? So again,&nbsp;  how will a loving relationship between two consenting human beings being recognized in legal union detract from your well being ?   Furthermore, how will preventing gays from being married help prevent gay crimes? What is the relationship between marriage and crime? If we were to eradicate marriage altogether, hetero and gay, would the crime rate drop significantly?   Insofar as a higher rate of STD's / AIDS is concerned, you can thank in-part the recently passed 40th president of the United States for the statistics you cite. Reagan didn't even utter the term &quot;AIDS&quot; publicly&nbsp; until six years into the epidemic (see   urlLink The High Price of Homophobia   from  The Body  / online AIDS resource) and even then funding wasn't allocated to combat it's spread until it was discovered be just as dangerous to heterosexuals.   Statistically, yes, there is a higher rate of AIDS in the gay community. But again, how does that support your claim that  gays being married detracts from your well being?  If anything, I think providing a legal union will help promote monogamy in the gay community and slow down the spread of these diseases.   If you somehow believe that AIDS is a curse from God on gays, then what's your God trying to say to Haitians, Africans, the Asians, inner-city Americans; many of whom are Christian heterosexuals?  In conclusion, the basic building block of society is the family (Eph.5:31), as outlined in God's word. Any deviation from that will ultimately result in the destruction of our society.  Maybe you've missed the  urlLink article about Gay couples adopting HIV positive infants  when no one else (even in our predominantly Christian society) would take them in. Maybe this is not a &quot;family&quot; per the traditional Christian definitions, but I think these actions stand out as more Christ-like and humanitarian than 99% of the evangelism I've heard. Can this compassion possibly contribute to the &quot;ultimate destruction of our society?&quot;.   Granted this is one case, but it is a counter point to what seems to be a gross generalization on your part. As stated in the above quote &quot;Homosexuals, like most minority groups, suffer the pains of stigma and stereotype for the faults of a few members&quot; - and I don't think it's a stretch to say that Christian doctrine is a significant contributor to those pains and stereotypes.   Homosexuality is a part of every society; past, present, future, great nations, poor nations, every nation. In two of the greatest empires in history bisexuality was acceptable and it wasn't uncommon for aristocratic men to have a wife for procreation and a man for pleasure. Would you say that these empires collapsed because of this? Was it even a contributing factor? Outlawing homosexuality won't force gay men and women into happy, productive heterosexual unions. Building a society where understanding and reason are given primacy over faith and religion will make a better world for our kids to grow up in.   Homosexuality is a part of our society regardless of what the Christian Church believes and regardless of whether or not our government chooses to recognize them. They know your views and why; but do you know their reasoning? Have you spoken to them and heard them or have you just stamped them as sinners and given up hope? The topic of homosexuality as a  choice  is irrelevant right now. What matters is that there  is  a conflict at hand and those doing the judging seem to offer little in the way of offering a solution acceptable to society as a whole. Would Jesus just sit there silent, pointing his finger? (Would he turn his nose up at an HIV positive infant?) The only solution I see from the Christian perspective seems tailor-made to Christians or their potential membership:  Accept the Grace of  our  God , deny your nature, and we'll stop judging you.   Everyone is familiar with your platform and why you think what you do, but seldom do we hear feasable, rational solutions from your side. It's my understanding that in this country we are free to believe and practice what we please insofar as it doesn't impede the pursuit of happiness for others. Your statements do little to support your claim that gays being married makes your world worse.   So I'll ask again;  how does a loving, consensual union between two non-criminal, tax paying US citizens directly impede your pursuit of happiness?    If you're just going to refer back to Scripture, don't forget that according to the Bible it's also a sin to worship other Gods. By your current rationale could we expect a forthcoming argument that the US should outlaw Islam as well?

      yes let's treat it like we treated apartheid in south africa. where there are brutal dictatorships there are, by definition, people resisting the government; otherwise, no need for the brutal dictatorship. where women are punished for being outspoken, there are women who are being outspoken. so let's support the people who are actually suffering. which is not about the possibility of "us" someday being in veils which, i'm sorry, is never going to happen. (and which is only required in a small minority of muslim countries anyways.)  many of your facts are wrong. just a few examples: 1) the PLO does not call for the "dissolution of Israel": the PLO has recognized Israel and the UN resolutions on partition. 2) where did you get the information that the U.S. spends as much on palestinians as on aid to Israel? i would like to read about that. in a quick looksie, all i can find is that the u.s. gives israel about $3.3 billion per year of direct aid (which is the highest amount the u.s. gives to any country in the world, and over half of which is military aid) and $100 million to palestinians, which is tightly controlled, for infrastructural projects only.  3) a democracy means that palestinian citizens of Israel can vote but can't own land? and that the rest of palestinians are under occupation and can't do either? it's not hard to have a "democracy" after you expel all your opponents.  arafat's reasoning was legitimate: isreal is "too small" a country to support the return of the palestinians who lived there to begin with, and yet any jew who has never lived there before is welcomed? that's crazy talk.  i accept your christian experience; i'm a jew and i understand perfectly well how zionists think and the myths that israel holds over my people; so it took me some time to extricate myself from that. i was wrong about making those comments about you not understanding.  mmm. what else. fundementalism in this country (religious, whathaveyou: what are we gonna do?) lob quotes back and forth with them? full disclosure: i tried to do it too and just ended up feeling like i needed to shower for three days. ew.  heh. ugh. let's have that party.  love to love you baby  xo

      Mmmmmmmk.  Let me clear my throat.  I think I’m having an allergic reaction to all these pine nuts I’ve been eating…they’re some unsalted, un fried mother fuckers that kinda explode on the way down.  I’m on a health food kick lately, thinking about going macrobiotic again.  It also has to do with the fact that I’m having that swallowing thing again—where the taste of meat makes me gag.  UPDATE:  ronald reagan is dead.  The war mongering leader of the  other  dark ages, the one we thought was so bad until this one came along.  R.I.P., homey, if you can, considering you go to your grave with the blood of millions on your hands, all of the early victims of AIDS in the U.S., who might not have gotten infected had you released the facts about the disease when they first became apparent.  You could have done something—called a state of emergency, gone on all tv stations at once and broadcast the information into every single home everywhere.  But no, it was only a bunch of faggots and druggies and low lives who were dying, so you sat on the information.  You dyed hair, actor cowboy smiling mother fucker.    I spit on yr grave.  Anyway, this post is mainly a response to  urlLink my colleague down below.   Werd,  urlLink Wallpaper Blake —you know that I’ve got mad respect for you, but I’m gonna have to take the mic and breakitdown.  Straight off you talked about the futility of  urlLink my pissin with the christians .  OK, yeah I’ll be the first to admit it’s most likely going to be a struggle that ends in vain.  These folks believe one thing, and I believe another, fine, fine.  But I resist the notion that “you’ll be prayed for and sacrificed for something you really don’t undersand”.  Because I understand, believe me I do.  You see I had my own time on the mountain, with something I thought was Jesus Christ.  Maybe it even was Jesus Christ, who knows.  There were several of us from town.  We drove around in a van and everything.  It was all kinds of fucked up, especially towards the end.  And it took someone who was like I am now—someone from the other side who  understood  to pull me the fuck out so that I’m the well adjusted person you have before you today.  Ha, yeah.  I know these born again kids so well because for two years I was one.  There you have it—the shocking truth about me.  All that and a bag of chips.  I can get in the minds of these people. For instance, I don’t think that guy had a heart attack while watching The Ashton of the Christ out of  fear .  Nah.  His heart prolly burst out of pleasure—extreme, total body pleasure at watching his near naked god being brutally murdered on a huge screen in dolby digital surround sound.  (can I get extra butter on these, pleasssse?).    See the whole problem with fanaticism is that these folks AREN’T scared.  As far as they can, they've stripped themselves of that basic human reaction. Maybe from the perspective of someone like yourself who’s apparently interested in spirituality and is perhaps even quite knowledgeable about several religious texts, having a fierce and devoted attachment to a very SPECIFIC and EXCLUSIONARY way of thinking might seem like it’s cool or interesting, but let me tell you, the church I was in was completely off the chain.  The sanity chain, that is.  We were ready to give our lives, yo.  I’m being completely real with you.  And there was no sadness, no quivering—only joy and loud, out-of-tune singing.  I was so happy, it was ridiculous.  I’m talking about the very beginning, which as I said before took place on a mountain.  In the winter.  With the ice and snow, just as it is described by Nietzsche.  It was not unlike the beginning of an acid trip—I felt myself floating above my body, and when I touched myself I seemed to be burning.  BTW, speaking of terrorists, you asked what was the common thread that allowed me to “lump together” Al Queada, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and the PLO.  Terrorism.  Each one of these groups has openly admitted to engaging and/or promoting terrorist activities that have taken the lives on innocent civilians.  Each one of these groups has SWORN not to stop these activities until the dissolution of the state of Israel as well as a host of other demands—but Israel is the big issue.  As well as any one who aids the Zionist cause, i.e., the United States.  So you see, they do consider us their enemy—these groups have declared jihad upon us.  That’s not just like declaring, oh, we don’t like you.  No, jihad equals a holy war.  A fight to the death.  Some, “you have fucked up my honor and now I have to avenge myself” fer real shit.  You point out that it's only me and some crazy dude in bellevue who can even fathom the mere possibility of some one taking over the U.S.  Wow.  There’s some REAL patriotism fer ya!  You can’t even imagine that someone could whup our mighty ass!      (yeah...one of the things I go on about with my loony bin friend is about how at one point, our enemies get the idea to fly our own planes into skyscrapers.  The Twin Towers.  Yep.  And then you know what happens?—they fall down and everyone in them dies and our coward ass president is MIA and no one is at the wheel and we're getting all sorts of conflicting reports, standing in midtown staring up at the chrysler building wondering what's next...)  sounds pretty crazy, huh?  I think our time, as in the American time, is coming to an end.  The great pendulum of history is slowly swinging back out, heading for asia...but that's another post...  At the moment, they hate us if for no other reason than because we’re friends with Israel—a friendship that is based, NOT on the fact that Israel is largely Jewish, as is the anti-Semitic train of thought, but because Israel is the only democracy in that region.  Yep.  Think about that for a second.  The only democracy.  I mean, democracy is a funny thing.  When it’s really working you don’t think about it.  But the other middle eastern countries don’t have any real democracy—at best they have see-thru, flimsy displays of it.  These countries are run by dictators and monarchs acting like dictators, or, as in the case of Saudi Arabia, an extremely wealthy theocracy that rules over a population that is very poor and completely without rights or freedoms.    Do you know what they do to you if they think you’re queer in Saudi Arabia?  Secret religious police roam the streets, following people and listening in on conversations.  An outspoken woman such as myself would not be allowed to exist there. Women are treated like straight-up property in some of these countries, even in the “friendly” ones, like Jordan and Kuwait.  They can’t vote, they can’t go to school, they can’t leave.  Even in Egypt, a relatively western and modern country, a woman has to get her husband or father to grant her written permission if she wants to leave the country.  It is considered a CRIME if she is caught alone in a house with a man who is not her husband or family member.    Tell me, why is this OK?  Oh, because it is a different culture than ours and we need to respect that.  Yeah?  Well then why was it OK to be against apartheid in South Africa?  Apartheid is a social system developed by the colonizers of South Africa, the Dutch—its’ been around forever, it’s a part of South African culture.  So why is being against apartheid considered the right and normal thing to do, but being against queers getting stoned isn’t?  If being liberal means that I’m supposed to tolerate that which would destroy me, than I’m not a liberal for that reason alone.    Speaking of violence—what “facts” do you have about the “systematic eradication” of Palestinians?  Because if you’re talking genocide, than you mean mass killing at a mechanized rate (but not necessarily mechanized, as was proven in Rwanda and in other African countries this very second.)  If by this hyperbole you meant to suggest the horror of the Palestinian situation, than I can only agree with you.  When I was in Israel a few months ago, I hung out in several cafes where Arab and Jewish Israelis chilled together with no problems.  It was Passover but everyone had big baskets of bread on their tables.  Not so much of the country is particularly religious. Again, it’s the fanatics, on both sides, who refuse to relent on this conflict.  Meanwhile their children are out smoking joints with one another, listening to hip-hop and dreaming of escaping to India and forgoing their mandatory, four-year army duty.    The way I see it, the former terrorist leader Arafat has been the biggest roadblock to peace in this whole thing.  The man is concerned with one thing and one thing only—holding on to his power by any means necessary, a feat made all the more ridiculous and harmful in its effects after the Israelis surrounded his compound and consigned him to it.  Why doesn’t he say, OK, enough already!  Someone else lead the show—do what’s best for the people!  Nope.  The prime ministers who have tried to come up and get something done resigned under pressure from him and his PLO goons.  You see, doing what’s best for the Palestinian people isn’t really an viable option in Arafat land.  Why doesn’t he give up all the names of the terrorist leaders that everyone knows he knows to the UN instead of turning a blind eye to every bus that gets blown to smithereens?  Why didn’t he sign the Camp David peace plan a couple years back, instead of backing out in the 11th hour, demanding that a Palestinian right of return be a part of it.  He had EVERYTHING else.  Everything.  Half of Jerusalem, the West Bank, and most importantly their own internationally recognized country.  There was going to be peace but he said no because he wanted the right for every single Palestinian citizen (of Palestine) to be able to pick up and move whenever they wanted into Israel and live their with full rights like every other citizen.  Isn’t that wild?  You’re getting your own country but you need to have the right to move to someone else’s whenever you feel like it.  Israel isn’t that big, yo.  But it’s got infrastructure and industry, so there’s reason to believe that should the Palestinians get right of return, the country would be overrun.  That said, it is imperative that Israel pull out of its territories.  Sharon needs to tell the fanatics from Brooklyn who ship off to the holy land with “go forth and multiply” ringing in their ears that the dream is over. Time to wakey, wakey and give the land back and end this nightmare.  You hear about he Golan Heights and the West Bank, places that Israel took over after the war in 67.  This occupation is a reference point, a touchstone for  those who feel Zionism has gone awry.  While there’s something to be said for that, what you don’t hear about very often is the situation of that war.  I think a lot of Americans don’t know the story.  How several countries decided to attack Israel at once.  How they put it in their constitutions that they would “push the Israelis into the sea”.  How they waited to attack on Yom Kippur, a holy day of fasting, when they knew the Israelis would be weaker for having not having eaten…  The chips were stacked against Israel.  By all accounts that shit should have been over.  They consider it a miracle that they survived, and the settlers who live in the lands that they won from that conflict (it’s the ultimate underdog story, not only did they win but they beat their collective ass too) point to this miracle as justification that they belong there, that the land has been claimed in the name of a  self defending act.  (The names of some of these settlements are taken from the names of WWII ghetto resistance fighters.  There’s the mentality that “look, you’ve tried repeatedly to erase me, kick me the fuck out of everywhere I try to live and blame me for everything under the sun so now I’m not leaving.”)  But leave they must, IMO.      That’s the only way out of a fucked up situation—compromise, not everyone gets what they want.  Incidentally, which country in the world gives Palestinians the most aid?  The U.S.  Everyone goes on about the U.S. giving money to Israel, but the U.S. gives money to a lot of countries, and for every million they give to Israel they try to match it up on the Palestinian side, the idea being that the situation will get worse if there’s a radical disparity in who has what over there.  Israel’s not a rich country.  I saw out of work, poor folks and a lot of shit wasn’t exactly state-of-the-art.    Yeah, but at least they have homes and their own country to live in—you might say.  Fair enough.  The refugee situation is totally fucked up.  But why don’t people also wave their finger at Jordan, at who’s border millions of displaced Palestinians have been living for years?  Jordan refuses to let them in.  You have to understand that despite the fact that many are educated, cosmopolitan people, the Palestinians are on the bottom of the Arab ladder.  Everyone’s given them the finger at some point.  None of these powerful kings and oil sultans want to waste their hard earned capitalist dollar on helping them out, so they tell their uneducated masses that it’s the jews’ fault and maybe america’s fault too which gives all those dispossessed people something to vent their anger out, other than at their government…just like the germans did after WWI.  It’s crazy to me how it’s the same story, all over again.  Or I should say, again and again and again.  All through out their history, the Jewish people have been hunted down and persecuted, condemned, hated and blamed.    I’m not jewish, btw.    I’m just trying to step back and see the situation from all sides.  I still have the luxury to do that.  I get the paper delivered to my front door.  I’ve cried at pictures of dead Palestinian kids and I’ve cried at pictures of dead israeli children.  I don’t think either side is to blame.  Ultimately, it’s the specter of organized religion that presides over all this—with its long, grim reaper face like that mask in Scream.  Werd is bond, I’ve got a lot of luxury.  Most people in this world have nothing.  If they have one possession it’s the wooden bowl they hope they’ll be able to put a scrap of food in.  And here you and I are, chatting, among other things, about how we’ll need to get cars to get around the city, cuz the trains will be on lock down for the convention…    mental note:  don’t forget to put “no blood for oil” across the side of my hummer…   We are all guilty.  Every single one of us in front of our monitors with our iced latte swirl hair gel drugs subwoofer cellphone wall-to-wall organic put that in yr pipe…  Dunkin donuts, starbucks…taco hell, kmart, the payphone at the parking lot…  (with the broken glass and the gay piece of ass)  I don’t know if I want any of it to go on either.    In our next and perhaps  Final american incarnation, perhaps we can be a little more stripped down.  A little skinnier, a little less obnoxious.   urlLink Susan Sontag is right, we are those photographs.   And I totally agree with you about the rape shit, abner louima, etc.  But then you say “become human and touch the earth?” Whaddya mean?  Are you talkin to me in this bit?  Cuz lemme assure you that I’m human, alright.  Human, all too human.    You’re right of course, that I can do better.  Yep.  Yr totally right about that, sweetheart.  I’mtryini’mtryini’m tryini’m tryin  (we’re all kids, letting of steam in one form or another)   par example , this manifesto.  Anyway,  I’ll let you sleep now  I lay the mic on the table  Having slayed y’all  Like Cain slew Abel…  Peace, Blake  Peace, werld.

      you will not sway these people. you will never be they're deepest fear realised. you will never be worthwhile enough; you will be prayed for and then sacrificed for something you really don't understand.   show me the passage where it says....   what the hell is this? footloose?  did you hear about the person who died of a heart attack while watching THE PASSION of mel gibson. yeh. that's what you're dealing with. fear like that? do not waste your time.  if you want to play, find a really smart conservative site, intelligent, and go about engaging. if you want to be even more wily, go to a lefty site and engage there. these people are soft targets, yes, they may be the backbone, but snakes have heads. the right-wing faith-based blogs.... well, there's no politics except a "reality" cushioned in whatever formal distortion field they live in, someone else, on another site said: I can't really get it together to care.  and make sure you know some facts, for instance, the PLO does not want "us" in veils. who's his "us"? don't lump al queda with the PLO. another fact: the palestinians are an occupied people being systematically eradicated. rush limbaugh while simultaneously the stupidest pigfucker on earth also said a very unintentionally smart thing, that they were kids blowing off some steam. it has a very peculiar american ring to it, that statement. the torture was a hazing ritual. they weren't watching the prisoners, they were smiling at eachother over the darkie covered in shit. and everybody's reading has been one of class. no way. this is homosexuality as homophobia. and this is because some shmuck had a camera. ask abner louima how it felt when justin volpe shoved a broomstick up his ass. call it "rape" and not sodomy, and call it universal, not isolated. please. can these people think this way? no. and you won't be able to figure out a way in any language to tell them otherwise. go there if you want and observe, learn something. they won't see you coming until you: or maybe jesus really was, and they can change.  write it differently dance a little brighter become human and touch the earth. that's the first thing the buddha did after his time under the tree.  you can do this better, you have to, you have no other choice.   we are attempting to preserve the life of the patient by any means-  they would last one minute if confronted by what we are and what we know and what we live. so, let it go.   ... to be expanded upon once i get less heated and have a cigarette, and yes, a shower and perhaps a nice hot toddy and some laps around the apartment to the Who   > And I love you in the protests of angry people > and in the joy of free people in the breaking of chains > And I love you in the face of those who are coming > to kill the Caliph Harun al-Rashid > Will you be my partner > in the killing of the Caliph Harun al-Rashid? > > -Nizar Qabbani  ***  urlLink Nizar Qabbani   i wish somehow, that "mainstream", by definition, did not mean conservative. but a dictatorship or any oppression implies so immediately it's root cause in resistance. you would not have to keep anyone in line, or scared, or disappeared, or as a second class citizen if you had any support whatsoever. Al Jazeera, based in Qatar, had numerous formal complaints made against it from other arab governments, and was looked upon favorably by the US up until this war started. why? because they were considered the voice of the people, they were critical, and fair and balanced in their reporting. Half of the correspondents are women.    that instead of this "clash of cultures", ignobly thrown out there as historical precedent and clothed in patriotism (please call it american nationalism, for instance when you talk about the "clash" of east and west, do you mean denmark vs. lebanon?, when you say america is the first, last and brightest hope, do you mean to exclude: holland, denmark, the faroe islands, spain, france... etc.), was instead seen as a clash within our own culture. However,  in  america, we have the neo-con born agains. and they, at the worst, suggest soul murder. that there shall be prayer and god's elect. in policy, i believe it's called manifest destiny. there will be no destruction of souls and minds and hearts,i will not pay 10 dollars to see mel gibson's passion or be prayed for. although if you wanted to send some nice thoughts my way about loosing the winter weight, tha'd be cool.. if i can resist your eternal condecension, and your politics; i have the reponsibility of marching and singing and prancing another way, and a way out. i will not take your life in such clear purpose so i can live mine. i will not be you, ye of the elect who do not know who you are, i do not have the true faith of the abyss that you have ***   I resist all the people of the cave, the people of superstition and mumbo-jumbo, their slavishness that enslaves them, their breeding like cows Before me are a thousand and one executioners Behind me are a thousand and one butchers Dear Lord, is there no shame but my nakedness? Dear Lord, does this East have no work but fussing over my hemline?   -Nizar Qabbani   I sense that the arts wear thin with you and that eloquence pants, and poetry and prose and speech race around your waist, not catching up   -Nizar Qabbani

      yes, yes, y’all.  good times.   you can’t win with  urlLink these   urlLink Christians .  I get called a  urlLink “homegrown nazi”  for purporting that Jesus’ message was one of love and inclusion, as opposed to one of partisan-driven condemnation.   urlLink i am banned and my comments are deleted, and yet I am the one who is accused of not wanting a real debate.    this is especially ironic considering that the deleted comment was an open invitation to any of those folks to partake in our discussion over here.  I offered anyone who was brave enough to step into the lion ring a month long membership on mrtt, in which they could post as much of whatever they wanted.  why preach to the choir, I asked, when there are souls to be saved?  but apparently, our souls aren’t worth it.  oh, well. maybe there’s a faster way to get to heaven. I mean, i can always pay 10 bucks to watch james caviezel get whipped to a bloody pulp.    I like that I got called a kid or a teenager by a lot of them.  It’s funny that when someone lacks the mental acumen to respond to your points, one of their first responses is to label what you said childish.  it’s especially funny when it comes to born again Christians, because another thing that jesus was really big on was how great children are, because their yet uncomplicated minds allow them to grasp the truth of love much easier than most adults...something that, religion aside, I think makes a good deal of sense. it’s like that old Digable Planets song…”we’re just babies man, we’re just babies” (a tune we’ll definitely have to spin at the party)  my baby points were—  1.	 urlLink to have someone please cite the passage in the bible where jesus says something against homosexuality (which I already knew didn’t exist)  --this one was half-responded to.  although my point was of course proven when the only anti-gay shit that anyone could dredge up was from the old testament and two of the letters.  when another poster remarked that these weren’t things that JESUS himself said, LaShawn (I’m going to totally use that name for my new R&B group, BTW) proclaimed that it didn’t matter, as the whole bible was authored by the breath of god or a god burb or something like that.  really, is that so?  I thought a bunch of dudes wrote it, but OK, if the whole thing is really all one in the same, why aren’t you jewish, lashawn?  I mean, from what you’re saying it doesn’t make a difference.  (BTW jesus said he was the way, the truth, the word and the light.  what do you think he meant by him being “the word”, hmm?  do you think maybe he meant that his words weighed a little heavier than everyone else’s?  don’t you think that if he really wanted to say something against queers he would have made sure to say it?)  2.  my second point, on the other site,  which no one had a response to and have now been deleted, were  urlLink in response to this post .  I seconded Guy’s sadness over the deaths of our troops and questioned the efficacy of Rumsfeld’s “stripped-down” military presence.  What are we waiting for?  I asked.  You talk about what it took to win WWII—one of the things it too were troops!  Lots and lots of ground troops!   Regardless of my feelings about us starting this war in the first place, I think we have NO CHOICE but to finish what we started—I just wish we had better leadership that didn’t make so many costly mistakes, misjudgments and overall underestimation of the enemy.    Oh, and of course the other comment was the one regarding the month long membership to mrtt—also wiped off the slate.    So, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t disappointed.  I’ve got this problem in which I expect more from people, even those who think differently than I do.  This whole episode  urlLink plus the thinly veiled threat I received at my own site  makes for not such a nice morning in blogville.  but that’s ok.  goddess  urlLink raymi  taught me that you know you’re doing something right when folks have got their panties in a wad…that said, one good thing that came from this is I came across the lucid, well written commentary of Per Son, who doesn’t appear to have a web page but seems smart and good tempered.  despite all this and the fact that I never heard back from y’all on my idea to invite folks from “the other side” to our site, I’m going to invite Per Son and see if he’s game.  you see, I’m fer real like that.  so fuck what ya heard, nerds.

         Now, just to clear the air on this, I do not believe in god.   The idea of religion, any organized religion, makes me physically fucking ill.  The conservative right, the one that's inherently wrong, makes me... Well, it pisses me right the fuck off.  Abash ye, in the light of going and fucking yourselves, take your dogma and your prayer beads and jump into the 21st century, you narrow-minded fucks.   And I'll understand if this gets dumped, but yes, you fuckers, you simple fucking conservative prick assholes,  I AM AN ANGRY PERSON!!!   I don't think I'm alone.   The oppression your "god" has caused in his long and bloody history blows my mind. Arg.  I need to focus for a second. My mind went all red.   See, I forgot people like  urlLink this , and fucktards like  urlLink this  existed.  I don't get out much.  And, the problem I have, and it  is  a problem, is that I don't care about intellectual discussion, I don't want to make any points or prove anyone wrong, and I am not afraid to express my personal hatred for them and their kind.  I would be most commonly referred to as, a  SHOCK TROOP .  And I love being ignorant.   Because I don't care what happens as a result of my words.   And I don't care who gets fucked in the process.   Because I am a block-head.   And I hate Christians. And Catholics. And Protestants. And every other fucking denomination of bible thumping fucks who believe in the bullshit.  But I don't hate "God". Because he is not real.  Just like Santa Claus And the Easter Bunny And the Tooth Fairy And Dragons And Elves And every other piece of fantasy that has ever been written. And how can you hate something that isn't real?  And I don't care if my hate makes me just like you judgmental fucks Cause I don't need to be right.  That would be your job.   Always right Always moral  Always full of shit.   Now, for those of you who are still reading, I am adding this no more than a cigarettes length after I posted it origionally.    The Enemy's Influence II   Some of you may remember The Enemy's Influence, my commentary on child-killing. It seems that I'm under "attack" by a gaggle of 15 year-old boys, no doubt influenced by the people mentioned in "Pray For These Two" posted below. If you see nasty, childish, moronic comments popping up, rest assured that I'm constantly monitoring the blog and they will be deleted as soon as possible.

I am of  urlLink ddubs.blogspot  / I had an idea that I thought you et al would be quite fond of. .. . I cannot post this on my site because I leave comments and they check my site... having THEM catch wind of this could cause wrinkles... but if we can coordinate a certain time and date to get this started... the results will be effective and amusing (the best combination you can ask for). So, here's a post... if you would like to issue it on either site, I'd feel like I did my part for the week ... propaganda aside. Let me know if you want me to do anything more or if I need to post it somewhere etc,  HERE:  So... I wasn't necessarily planning on participating in that  urlLink Fuck Bush  shindig... not in the normal sense anyway... due to (in some part) my ultimate desire to be at least 30 square miles away from the (RNC) epicenter. Anyhow... I have been reading many conservative's blogs and commenting on them. Sometimes my comments result in an intellectual debate; other times I get shunned and disregarded like I'm speaking farsi when I should have been speaking tagalog (I always do that). So, here it is... we can start at  urlLink MyDamascusRoad  and   urlLink LaShawnBarber.Blogspot.com . We can fuck that whole Rocky Mountain Alliance with comments that are far too contrarian for their glass ears. Pop-ups and spyware hath no fury like Fuck Bush's scorn.  So... leave a comment on a site that is as blasphemous (they're all so very jesus-crazy... praise be unto him), nasty or political (imagine that!) as you want. Go to every link until every site is infected with our virus.  They can't block everybody. They can't keep deleting posts...  they may have to change their names and go into the "Can I get a Witness Protection Program."  Sgonna be good.    remember... you can't fuck with DeJesus, but you can Fuck Bush.

       urlLink i do love the cracks   so what if this, on top of every other piece of evidence, is what we're up against? does it help to imagine this play as a PAX disaster movie of the week? PAX, evilly, i should say, is (at least on my cable service), the first channel i have to hurdle before i scurry over to the E! celebrity news.  we know for instance, that nixon made lists. "...a number of to-do and to-be lists that Nixon wrote on yellow legal pads in the solitude of his hideaway in the Executive Office Building. These reveal aspirations for nobility of character so different from the reality of who Nixon was as to be poignant. One typical list included these items:    Each day a chance to do something memorable for someone.  Need to be good to do good.  Need for joy, serenity, confidence, inspirational.  Goals: Set example, inspire, instill pride. "   motherboards patti smith jackie beat/formika the factory (pre and post valerie solanas) Subcomandante Marcos (in the party people sense; not the whole actually, like, guns and shit... i mean, can you  imagine  all the fruits with that whole mess? girl. it's a problem finding where exactly we set down our half glass of red bull and vodka). but the revolution part we can do.  this, as far as i can tell, is not poignant. this is the life we've led up until now: all the contradictions, pettiness, joy, heart, love and confusion. the addictions and the disappointments, anger and discontent. you use that, to the best of your ability and you cleave to  that  and you say this is this. our music as moral law. (that even includes junior and victor)  "No people sing with such pure voices as those who live in deepest hell; what we take for the song of angels is their song" - Kafka  I hate a song that makes you think that you are not any good. I hate a song that makes you think that you are just born to lose. Bound to lose. No good to nobody. No good for nothing. Because you are too old or too young or too fat or too slim or too ugly or too this or too that. Songs that run you down or poke fun at you on account of your bad luck or hard travelling. I am out to fight those songs to my very last breath of air and my last drop of blood. I am out to sing songs that will prove to you that this is your world and that if it has hit you pretty hard and knocked you for a dozen loops, no matter what color, what size you are, how you are built, I am out to sing the songs that make you take pride in yourself and in your work. And the songs that I sing are made up for the most part by all sorts of folks just about like you.  - Woody Guthrie (folksinger)  AND ONE MORE because it's early and we're in really good company, folks.  Music is one of the ways by which you can know everything which is going on in the world... Through music, you can become sad, joyful, loving... You can learn mathematics, touch, pacing... You can see colours through music... Anything human can be felt through music, which means there is no limit to the creating that can be done... It's like God... you know? - Nina Simone (singer/musician)  and you can get laid. another thing: is there anyway to set up discussion boards?

          urlLink sean  had the brilliant idea of putting  urlLink the skullfuck bush party  on  urlLink the motherboards , so today i built my profile and tried to come up with my first post.  i feel like this is a great chance to get the idea about our party  out there , into the real world underground, where it has a chance to impress some of nyc's most beautiful people. personally, i loved Jackie 60, Mother, and now, Motherfucker.  we would do well to borrow a little from the vibe of these parties.    don't know what i'm talking about?  off to google you go. come back when you've learned something.  yes, and when you do get back, please help me with ideas, suggestions, poetry, pix--anything! for this first post onto the grand dame. write your suggestions in the comments.  then go on and  urlLink sign up  and get profiles yourselves.  actually, that might be a good idea. go figure out some chat spaces, see what people think of the idea, that way we might create a buzz.  IMO that's the most important thing, right now.  exposure.  we need people to hear about this party and get excited about the idea of partying their heads off right next to the republican national convention.  we want them to get intrigued by the idea of a blog tidal wave hurtling towards the shore of the real world...a real underground movement, made up of a gang of unknown (warriors)connected across the internet.  with words.  ha.    urlLink we're all full of words.     we want this thing to become air borne, so that more and more people hear about it, and that they in turn think about it and talk about it and write about it on the blogs we've inspired them to create.  we want them to join our...    what?  ...gang?  ...metaphysical club?  ...fiesta political...?  bubonic thinktank?  whatever it's called, our little group here is a just that, a group of people who happened to all comment on the same blog post. not a real tried and true demographic, i'd say.  but you're the ones.  i waited this long to start a blog and you're the ones i finally choose.  i hope you're ready.  i think TRUE's right--we should invite folks of the opposite persuasion.  as well as bi and quasi partisan folks.  we need some action, we need to stay loose.  but it's up to you guys.  from here on in, anybody who's added doesn't get to be admin, with the exception of  urlLink briar , who was one of the original invitees (OIs) but never got the email.  how does that sound?  (of course, some of you may have noticed that a certain someone who was NOT an OI is taking an extra long time making up his mind whether he wants to join the fun)  (cue to make some noise)  that said, you guys should feel free to stretch out, change shit around in the template.  add some links(like your own)  like you know, put up the things you want...     urlLink jeroen , what are you waiting for?  deck us out, dude.  and whatever, you don't have to write in english.  this is a multi-party, multi-cultural, multi-lingual affair.   urlLink paxgitmo . your email addy, por favor.  ...the hardest thing will be to get that big baller to back us.  after that, the thing will just grow exponentially.  the fact that you guys are here already is fucking crazy.  all these dangerous minds gathered in one place  i'm proud of this site.  TRUE and i were talking about it the other night, while we defrosted her refrigerator...the fact that it could really work.  fuck, you guys!  it could really work!  i think patti smith is a great idea, BTW.  plus if you're reading this and you want in just ask.

         Why wouldn't someone rather vote for Bush than for Kerry? Can you name one difference between them? Not if you only watch mainstream news.   Mr. Kerry proposes spending $650 billion extending health insurance to lower- and middle-income families. Whether you approve or not, you can't say he hasn't addressed the issue. Why hasn't this voter heard about it?  Well, I've been reading 60 days' worth of transcripts from the places four out of five Americans cite as where they usually get their news: the major cable and broadcast TV networks. Never mind the details - I couldn't even find a clear statement that Mr. Kerry wants to roll back recent high-income tax cuts and use the money to cover most of the uninsured. When reports mentioned the Kerry plan at all, it was usually horse race analysis - how it's playing, not what's in it.  On the other hand, everyone knows that Teresa Heinz Kerry told someone to "shove it," though even there, the context was missing. Except for a brief reference on MSNBC, none of the transcripts I've read mention that the target of her ire works for Richard Mellon Scaife, a billionaire who financed smear campaigns against the Clintons - including accusations of murder. (CNN did mention Mr. Scaife on its Web site, but described him only as a donor to "conservative causes.") And viewers learned nothing about Mr. Scaife's long vendetta against Mrs. Heinz Kerry herself . ( Triumph of the Trivial ,truthout.org) Yeah, but Kerry is a flip-flopper. Bush is a man of faith.  Biologist Richard Dawkins, in the essay   Mind Viruses  , defines 'faith as a source of knowledge' as one such mind virus; " The patient typically finds himself impelled by some deep, inner conviction that...something that doesn't owe anything to evidence or reason , he feels as totally compelling and convincing....we doctors refer to such a belief as 'faith'....  indeed, they may feel the less evidence there is, the more virtuous the belief...." Hmmm. WMD, anybody?  " The sufferer may find himself behaving intolerantly toward vectors of rival faiths, in extreme cases even killing them   (no shit) . ...the prognosis is poor unless he  becomes open to modes of thought   (emphasis mine- fat chance)   that are potentially inimical to his faith, such as the method of scientific reason that may function rather like a piece of antiviral software. If not, this can lead only to greater self-destruction in service of his virtuous beliefs."   Thank the God of the rationalist founders of this constitution  for an intelligent man who can change course when the light at the end of the tunnel is an oncoming train.    "Men will cease to commit atrocites only when they cease to believe absurdities."  - Voltaire

Todd J. Godwin,  21, of Muskingum County, Ohio; assigned to 1st Battalion, 8th Marines, 2nd Marine Division, Camp Lejeune, N.C.; killed July 20 by enemy action in Anbar province, Iraq.    sometimes i wonder about random things. like..     Marine Pfc. Rodricka A. Youmans,    22, of Allendale, S.C.; assigned to 2nd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp Lejeune, N.C.; killed July 6 by enemy action in Anbar province, Iraq.    how it would actually feel to get shot in the arm. would your fingers tingle? is it possible not to cry? did you see it coming?     Army Sgt. 1st Class Linda Ann Tarango-Griess,    33, of Sutton, Neb.; assigned to the 267th Ordnance Company, Nebraska National Guard, Lincoln, Neb.; killed July 11 when an improvised explosive device detonated near her convoy vehicle in Samarra, Iraq.    or if i could peep a large piece of shrapnel protruding from an important part of my body, who would i think of first? would i feel ill? the dull nausea you get when you smash your shin into a table, maybe. or nothing. cold fear and clammy palms?

Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Robert B. Jenkins,    35, of Stuart, Fla.; assigned to Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 14, Jacksonville, Fla.; killed May 2 by hostile fire in Anbar province, Iraq.    he said he thinks america is killing boys that bleed like him. and maybe girls that bleed like him. he said that america might not be crippling the jewish, but people are people. he said hitler was a pretty fucked up dude.      Army Pfc. Bradley G. Kritzer,    18, of Irvona, Pa.; assigned to 1st Battalion, 21st Field Artillery Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, Fort Hood, Texas; killed May 5 when his vehicle hit an improvised explosive device in Baghdad.    he said he was looking at pictures of iraq in class and he thinks that dinosaurs and cockroaches should be living there, not human beans. beans.    like, shit.    urlLink    Army Spc.

      so yeah, i've been one post away from nonexistence on this blog and i feel guilty. but you know, death does that to you. having a friend die is like an eye opener. well i sort of kind of knew that i had low tolerance for stupid people but what the fuck, now is the time to say it because maybe i'll die tommorrow and think sheeettt, should of just said it:  i fucking hate stupid people.     so i use to work for a politikian eh? a big one too, toque wise. thing is, she's so stupid that whenever i see shit in the news i want to call her and tell her she is so stupid she makes my brain hurt (how could i have WORKED FOR HER?). she has a billion people fucking working for her--all she has to do is say shit right.  all she has to do is read the fucking shit we (i) wrote for you. how the fuck could you screw that up? NO THINKING REQUIRED.   politikians should not say things on their own, they are not smart enough. but the smarter ones know that and so they listen to the smart people around them and just read the shit they are given.    so i have to fucking tell you that i get so fucking annoyed when i hear bush's grammatical errors or when he gets  urlLink commonplace idioms  wrong. like are you a fucking retard? (no offense to the retards out there) you're the president of the united states and you can't even read off the teleprompter properly. you have a million billion staff planning your every move, your every word, your every step. if the dood can't handle just reading, how the fuck is he running the country? no seriously, let's not even talk about the politiks, let's talk about bush and hooked on phonics.

      I'm going to vote my conscience, and my conscience says vote libertarian, which I will undoubtably do.    urlLink "Where ( Michael) Badnarik's answers were prompted by his knowledge of and reliance on the Constitution, Nolan frequently proposed solutions using libertarian concepts of free trade and market economics and Russo tended toward a gut-level response that left some viewing him positively as the "common-man" candidate.  But continually, Badnarik returned to the Constitution for his responses.  "Twenty years ago I began studying the Constitution," he said in his acceptance speech. "And I got very confused. I saw no connection between the Constitution and our government. And the reason … is that there is none."  And that's the problem he wants to fix, he says.  One of Badnarik's most effective illustrations during the debate was comparing the U.S. government to a fire in the house: A fire in the fireplace is good, just like a government that operates within the bounds of the Constitution is good.  But if the fire gets out of the fireplace, it is a bad fire and needs to be stamped out; and "any time government gets outside the Constitution, it is a bad government, and you have to stamp it out," Badnarik said as he concluded his opening comments, to riotous applause."   The  urlLink Libertarian  Party is the third largest political party in the United States. Millions of Americans have voted for Libertarian Party candidates in past elections throughout the country, despite the fact that many state governments place every imaginable roadblock in our path in order to keep our candidates off the ballot and deprive voters of a real choice.  Libertarians believe the answer to America's political problems is the same commitment to freedom that earned America its greatness: a free-market economy and the abundance and prosperity it brings; a dedication to civil liberties and personal freedom that marks this country above all others; and a foreign policy of non-intervention, peace, and free trade as prescribed by America's founders.   -A first grade teacher explains to her class that she is a liberal Democrat. She asks her students to raise their hands if they are liberal Democrats too. Not really knowing what a liberal Democrat is but wanting to be like their teacher, their hands explode into the air like fleshy fireworks. There is, however, one exception. A girl named Lucy does not go along with the crowd. The teacher asks her why she decided to be different.  "Because I'm not a liberal Democrat." Then, asks the teacher, what are you? "Why I'm a proud Libertarian" boasts the little girl. The teacher is a little perturbed now, her face slightly red. She asks Lucy why she is a Libertarian. "Well, I was brought up to trust in myself instead of relying on an intrusive government to care for me and do all of my thinking. My Dad and Mom are proud Libertarians, and I am a proud Libertarian too."  The teacher is now angry. "That's no reason," she says loudly. "What if your Mom was a moron, and your dad was a moron. What would you be then?" A pause, and a smile.  "Then," says Lucy, "I'd be a liberal Democrat."  Abraham Lincoln said:            "As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy. Whatever differs from this, to the extent of the difference, is no democracy." - The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln edited by Roy P. Basler, Volume II, (August 1, 1858?), p. 532

      Just because I vote for a leader doesn't admit or submit into being led. There's no choice of whether or not to have a President. Regarding Common Sense, Thomas Paine, in Common Sense, wrote:     &nbsp;       Society is produced by our wants, and government by our wickedness; the former promotes our happiness POSITIVELY by uniting our affections, the latter NEGATIVELY by restraining our vices. The one encourages intercourse, the other creates distinctions. The first is a patron, the last a punisher.    Society in every state is a blessing, but Government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one: for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries BY A GOVERNMENT, which we might expect in a country WITHOUT GOVERNMENT, our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer.    Government, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence...       Common sense demands action often, inaction&nbsp;as well...&nbsp;yet sometimes the latter is more effective than the former. The principles each of us hold, no matter how unique or illogical to&nbsp;others, are vital, personal and essential. Stubborness is a similar trait as well, vital, personal, etc.&nbsp;--  &nbsp;but occasionally it must cede.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Anarchy, despite common thought, is a philosophy, a style of governing and a movement. Anarchy is&nbsp;debated among intellectuals as is the philosophy of preemption. They have both been argued for ages but to no conclusion. What does this mean? Neither is an irrefutable truth, nor should be disregarded and considered foolish. Anarchy, preemption, stubborness, communism, socialism and democracy&nbsp;are all perfect in theory. In practice, however,&nbsp;each one is flawed, prone to corruption, and essentially catastrophic, just like apathy.   But&nbsp;what do you get when you combine all of these philosophies, ideals, theories, etc.? You&nbsp;realize that the only true option and the only true path is, well, forward.  urlLink Conservative  means timid, traditional, unchangeable,&nbsp;uncreative, undaring and unimaginative. Liberal, although it sometimes means frivolous and dispassionate, means&nbsp;&nbsp;humanistic, humanitarian,&nbsp;&nbsp;receptive, reformist, tolerant,  progressive &nbsp;and&nbsp;unbiased. And although all of Kerry's views aren't purely Liberal, why is there a negative connotation?  Move forward. Vote your conscience, but if your conscience says don't vote, talk to yourself and convince it otherwise. We will have record numbers at the polls this year and we will slap apathy in the face, but don't fall into the trap. One voice whispering doesn't amount to much; millions of voices whispering turns into a roar.       &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;

      I just want to start by saying that I vehemently disagree with a lot of what's been written in the past two day. I also strongly disagree with a lot of your opinions about politics and voting.   First and foremost, I disagree with the idea that if I am against Bush being in the White House, then my only choice is to vote for Kerry. I don't agree and I never will. I am not going to vote for "the lesser of two evils". I just won't do it. I don't like Democrats anymore than Republicans, including the world-class bullshitting Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton is not a great man, contrary to how some of you individuals have trumped him. Let's not forget, he doesn't know what the definition of "is" is.   I will vote third-party simply because I refuse to buy into the theory that a third party vote is a wasted vote. I think that any vote that isn't for something that I believe in is a wasted vote, regardless of weather I'm "giving a vote" to Bush or not.   Another thing, I think people that don't vote have every right to bitch about how fucked the country and/or president is. I didn't vote in the last election and I bitch about Bush all the time. Reason being, as an American, I have the right to bitch. I also have the right not to vote. Voting is a right that cannot (in theory) be taken from me. It's not my duty to cast my vote for one of these two fucks. I'd never vote for Gore, nor would I vote for Bush. But as an American, I have every right to express my discontent with either of these stupid fuckers, vote or no vote.   There is nobody worth voting for.   I'm not a liberal or a conservative. What I am is someone that's disgusted with the current state of the nation.  Do I think Kerry is going to change shit? No.  Do I think Bush is going to be any less of a fuck? No.  Am I going to vote for either of them? No.  But what I am going to do is vote.  And I'm voting third party.  Because I'm not going to let others tell me that there is no point. The reason it's pointless is because everyone buys into the theory that a third-party vote is a worthless vote. Oh well, it's still a vote, and I don't feel it's a waste. I'm making a choice because I want CHANGE, not just a swing of the guard. It's an old boys club up there at D.C., and they need to go.   Maybe people will stop listening to naysayers and start listening to their heads. Until then, I'll be the idiot tossing away his vote and bitching about the assholes YOU voted for.

       I think it's cool that she's a ketchup heiress. And that she speaks five languages. Fluently.  And that she tells off smug reporters. At 65 she seems like an ex European super model but the thing is, she's a brainiac. She demonstrated for civil rights in South Africa in the 50s, before it was even hip to.  She calls on America to be "A moral nation that rejects thoughtless and greedy choices in favor of thoughtful and generous actions; a moral nation that leads through the power of its ideas and the power of its example."  Then she told everyone that good environmental policy is good economics.  Teresa Heinz Kerry is smart as a whip. And fucking sassy.

      Here's number 103 for this beefy thing and that's how hot it was on Saturday, the humidity off the charts. I stood barefoot on the asphalt because I can and felt the soles of my feet melt. We broke records we broke rules let's not stop here. Heat makes people faster and I'm looking at this thing thinking shit my feet were burning and this thing is so fast&nbsp;feel that momentum. Here it comes here it comes, don't buy it if it's not fair, if it's not true. I would rather stand on hot asphalt than talk to someone who doesn't know the difference between right and wrong because it's not subjective or objective or reflexive or even a consideration. Hypocrites talk like saints&nbsp;and hide their claws so watch out you can tell them by their hearts. Be safe. Love justice. Seek truth. We don't need no stinking&nbsp;patrio-tactless because we already have enough rules. To break. Let's put&nbsp;Dubya barefoot in the middle of Iran and see if he really&nbsp;believes his own beliefs.  Fuck it's hot.

         urlLink    "Their opponents will tell you we should be afraid of John Kerry and John Edwards because they won't stand up to terrorists. Don't you believe it. Strength and wisdom are not opposing values."   Bill Clinton rocked the Democratic National Convention last night. That strength and wisdom line was straight out of The Karate Kid. I know people love to hate Clinton because he's a slutty southern genius and that's intimidating. You know. Clinton probably catches more fish than you. He probably drives a bigger truck. He gives you the feeling that he just might be able to charm his way into your daughters and / or wifes' pants.   Fuck that, though. I love moderate Democrats. I think being liberal doesn't mean you're a pussy. It just means that you're optimistic and careful, not blind or weak. More than that, I dig southern boys. Dammit if the likes of Clinton and Edwards and Jimmy Carter don't make me lose it. They're so fucking cool. They're peach pie for chrissakes. They're boyscouts with vision and ambition. They mean it. I know, I live here. It's not some cheesy used car salesman shtick.   And don't you say a fucking thing about Jimmy Carter. That man is an angel.  urlLink -bunny mcintosh

      I always feel like the least cool one at this party. I know I have said that before, but I'm saying it again. I am a liberal in most ways, a yuppie in most ways, something of a socialist capitalist. Anti-war, pro-choice, the usual givens.  I am reading Bill Clinton's autobiography. Slowly. Slowly-issimo. I have hit the early 80's and it's starting to get a little boring. Chelsea is born and toddling about. He's fussed and fretted about Vietnam. Momma is the best but married a louse. You know. Now he's lost his governor-ship after one term. I think he regains it at some point soon but I'm not much on the history of my ex-presidents. Other than that he comes from a town called Hope.  I know that much because I was 21 years old and voting for the first time when he was running for re-election in '96. My mother had just died, and I was sitting on the striped couch in my Tuckahoe, NY apartment hoping my many roomates wouldn't come home anytime soon because I was weeping. Weeping on the couch at the Democratic National Convention video about A Town Called Hope.  When he ran in '92, I was 17 and a senior in high school at a once-hippie private school in the Haight Ashbury. I took a class all about the election in the first ten weeks of the school year. I got extra credit for doing an exit poll near my house. There were about ten of us in the class - only one was old enough to vote and we were all jealous. He was Josh S******* and I had had a major crush on him freshman year. He was California adorable. And now he drove his own car&nbsp;and could vote, because his birthday was the first one in our class, October something. We all sat around with LeRoy, the best history teacher I ever had (he used to eat chalk to get us to pay attention). We followed all the candidates and watched as they nominated this guy named Clinton and we all wondered if it would work, and when they played Fleetwood Mac it made me teary. Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow indeed. I was Tomorrow. I felt, for the first time, like I was Tomorrow.  The thing is, I miss the Clinton's ridiculously. I want Hillary to behave her way into the presidency. I know that might require sweet-talking a few demographics I don't care much for, and if that's the case I will possibly forgive her later.&nbsp;I want Chelsea to be my senator someday. I love them. I miss him. I like his speeches. I even like his crappily-written&nbsp;book. I believe he is sincere. I believe he cares. I think of "Primary Colors" as something of a dcoumentary and I just watched it the other night and it made me feel like crying.  I am pro-voting. I am very, very pro-voting, because I truly, truly believe that if you don't vote you don't have a right to complain. I do. Just my opinion. I am a total and complete pragmatist, a realist, and this is what we have and this is what we have to do and these are our choices and we have to choose one of them or else we may not participate in the whole deal at all. We can either sit out the whole game QUIETLY or we may particpate in the process as outlined and say whatever we damn well please. I know others disagree. This is just one of those things that seem absoltely true to me.  Then again, I have a complete fear of authority, so perhaps that's where this comes from.  I have never been arrested and when the cops come toward me with horses, I turn around and go home.  Things have a way of getting out of control. I don't believe that it is necessary to get that way myself.  I like to be very, very much in control.  I would sleep with Hillary Clinton if she offered. I feel a strange kindred spirit in her.  I miss the Clinton's and I hope that we can get them back someday. Back in a way that they can control things the way they want to and not the way the people of upstate New York want them to.  I am pretty sure I am alone here on this one. You have to keep in mind that my mother used to weep every time she heard The Star Spangled Banner.  Just thought I'd share.

         Maybe I’m retarded, but I really like the atari’s cover version of boys of summer.  What that has to do with fucking bush, er, rather, skullfucking him, is beyond me.  Sorry.  When I was in mex, my brother in law asked me who I thought would win the election.  I told him, in my broken Spanish, that I thought it would be close, that I wasn’t sure, I hedged, I hawed, I didn’t really answer.  At the Houston airport I read a column by some talking, er, scribing, head, that he felt that bush would win.  His rationale for this deduction was that the democratic party was reacting rather than acting.  Their main tableau for lack of a better word, or, rather, platform, was that the repubs sucked and bush sucked and therefore, hey, here we are, the best and only alternative.  And I almost wept in my bloody mary, cuz I felt, in my naivete possibly, that he had a valid fucking point.  Then on the airplane ride, a long 8 hour flight from texas to the islands, I sat next to some 16 year old military brat who bled GOP and was trying to convince me of the merits of mister double-u.  iraq was better off now than under saddam.  Bush was doing a good job, despite the deficit.  A lot of other arguments which I kind of filtered and answered lightly cuz my throat was sore and I’d been out of the country and didn’t really know what the fuck was going on anyway.  So I guess my point in the doggerel is, what is the overlying point we can make to the hardcore repubs, those that are determined to vote bush, to make them see the folly of their ways, cuz if you can come up with something to convince them (which may be impossible) shit, that would be like using a cannon on a bumblebee when it comes time to discuss ishes with the undecideds.  Let me clarify, I don’t know the answer, I just don’t have my head in it at this time.  I’m pretty sure I’m voting for kerry, though I’m not sure in exact terms why.  I don’t believe every little thing I was fed by Michael moore in his 911 movie.  I also think that bush is a conniving bastard and needs to get kicked out of office.    Explain it to me like I’m a five year old.  Even though you prolly already did.  I wasn’t listening.  And neither was john q. public.  Repetition and clarity is the mother of results.  Or something like that.  Saying skullfuck bush ain’t enough.  Tell me why why why and from the perspective from which both a millionaire sucking on a smuggled Cuban and a welfare mother will nod their head in agreement.  Then we’ll have kerry in office.    (whoop dee fricken doo)  Gracias.

          Big ups to  urlLink Jamie  for&nbsp;sending me this pic...   What's up, party people?&nbsp; I've been holed up in the hut, jedi master style, droppin knowledge and expensive pharmaceuticals with achey breaky Sterling.&nbsp; More on that later.&nbsp; First, I wanted to inform you that next week I plan on beginning the graffiti/propaganda onslaught on NYC and the surrounding areas.&nbsp; I'll be breaking out the famous pink bandanna and hitting up all the sweet spots, digi camera in tow.&nbsp; If I fly off the radar for a few&nbsp;you'll know it's because I got thrown in the&nbsp;clink for vandalism (again).&nbsp; Got Stencils?&nbsp; C'mon all you&nbsp;design kids, (erhm  urlLink IDEA ?) &nbsp;give us a little somethin' something--a .pdf that we can print out and put up in our respective cities/towns/military bases/urban sprawl hellholes...   It doesn't have to be complicated, in fact it should be simple and to the point...not too much text--just make sure it says SKULLFUCK BUSH.   mmmk?   check out  urlLink OBEY GIANT  for inspiration and tips.  muchos grassy ass.   Folks have been asking about a date...OK, here's the real deal, Holyfield:   The&nbsp;date of the actual&nbsp;PARTY is September 2nd at Crobar.&nbsp; We will be piggy-backing on Larry Tee's Disgraceland Weekly, so any PR needs to mention that.   The RNC is being held&nbsp;in Madison Square Garden&nbsp;from August 30th to September 2nd.&nbsp; The way I see it, SKULLFUCK BUSH is all about fucking shit up for that entire week.&nbsp; I'm talking non-registered,&nbsp;slightly artsy, slightly punk, slightly spontaneous protest performed by roving crews&nbsp;and individuals.&nbsp; I would like (and you guys are free to disagree with me) to promote the idea that&nbsp;anyone and everyone can&nbsp;be down&nbsp;with this.&nbsp; Even if you can't be physically present in the City.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you live in the middle of nowhere.&nbsp; All you need is an internet connection and a spot to&nbsp;post the documentation of how you participated in SKULLFUCK BUSH.&nbsp; And that spot is here, of course.&nbsp; I want folks making T-shirts, doing graffiti, writing songs, posts, poems, paintings...i want them to send us pix of&nbsp;SKULLFUCK&nbsp;BUSH written in the sky.&nbsp; Stickers, drug dreams, tattoos...whatever's clever.  I want folks to send us emails they wrote to their local politicians as&nbsp;well as to&nbsp;Maddonna.&nbsp;   Check on  urlLink Brodie's  last post.&nbsp; That's EXACTLY&nbsp; what i'm talkin about.&nbsp; A simple email sent and BAM he made something HAPPEN.  I want this site to become a repository (no that's&nbsp;not the thing you stick up yr ass)  I want it to be both the chill out room and the main floor.  The rhyme and the rhythm...  When Sterling and I first brainstormed this, the idea&nbsp;had mostly&nbsp;to do with throwing a real party in NYC.&nbsp; That's&nbsp;still the cornerstone, but&nbsp;bellee me I know how hard it is to scrape together the cash and the time off work to fly yr ass out here.&nbsp; That's why this internet shit is so great.&nbsp; YOU CAN ALL BE HERE.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm going to see about getting as many&nbsp;laptops together for that week as I possibly can.&nbsp; Maybe&nbsp;an internet cafe&nbsp;in the city can hook us up?&nbsp; See that--just&nbsp;by typing about it I brainstormed another SKULLFUCK BUSH idea.&nbsp; Don't get hung up on&nbsp;making shit all beautiful and stunningly written.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do that on yr own site.&nbsp; Come here and let it all hang loose.&nbsp; Invite yr peeps to join in.&nbsp; Email them an invite.&nbsp; Do it.&nbsp; Now, not later. &nbsp;If yr reading this and you&nbsp;have anything, anything at all you think you can contribute, drop a comment and I'll hook you up.&nbsp;   The only thing you&nbsp;i&nbsp;WON'T let you do is SLEEP.&nbsp;&nbsp;  ya feel me?&nbsp;   the bell's ringing.  wake up.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;      &nbsp;

         I've just tried four different times to write a cohesive op-ed piece on how I feel about this topic, and I can't .  Just the facts-  One day in America courtesy of the Bush Administration-     Interior Secretary Gail Norton announced at the Wildlife Science Center in Forest Lake, Minn., that the  grey wolf  should be removed from federal protection from Maine to the Dakotas.  American&nbsp;soldiers  urlLink rape  Iraqi boys in U.S. custody; capture their hijinx on film.  My  urlLink  neighbor  comes home dead, but not dishonored; his mother slams Bush, invites the press to the funeral.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I notice this today because this was the news I was reading while waiting to see my Paid Friend.  &nbsp;For once, I didn't feel like a crazy bitch because I&nbsp; think a world with wolves in it has more value than one deeded over to Halliburton.  &nbsp;For once, I don't think it's just 'post-traumatic-related referred depression' when I go out of my mind with disgust and grief at my country's defense department  urlLink systematically  turning good citizens into&nbsp;conscienceless rapists and murderers.   My dad was always telling us how lucky we were we didn't know what war was like.   We didn't know what war was like, because he never talked ,about anything. But we weren't lucky. All five of us have some degree of PTSD.   Killing hurts. Killing violates the soldier and degrades the culture. Wartime killing allows the cat-firework-cornholing element of the population to excercise their urlLink sadism  on a grand scale.  Odysseus only took twenty years&nbsp; to get back to normal. Most combat veterans aren't as lucky.  In the middle ages, people who didn't party around the roasting of heretics were ridiculed too.  One witness to the burning of Joan of Arc, one of her executioners, in fact, gave her a cross to hold that he made from the pyre. Her last words, "God Bless you", were to him.  I want to be something better than that man.     La Coursier de Jeanne D'Arc- &nbsp;Linda McCarriston       You know that they burned her horse  before her. Though it is not recorded,  you know that they burned her Percheron  first, before her eyes, because you   know that story, so old that story,  the routine story, carried to its  extreme, of the cruelty that can make  of what a woman hears a silence,   that can make of what a woman sees  a lie. She had no son for them to burn,  for them to take from her in the world  not of her making and put to its pyre,   so they layered a greater one in front of  where she was staked to her own--

      First, I just want to note, my innernet's been down for two and a half days.&nbsp; I've been brain-storming about the various constructive and creative&nbsp;ways I may be able to contribute to the SkullFuck Bush Campaign. I've been making notes, dabbling in a few artistic areas, etc.  My first concern though is how the fuck I'm going to get to NYC in the first place. I've never flown, I don't know a damn thing about New York (or traveling at all), and I don't really know anyone.   All that aside, I am more than willing to lend my average artistic skills and my giant penchant for pissing off authority.  One idea I had was setting up a pay-pal account for communal bail money.  Heh. That's a joke.  But in all seriousness, some of us may end up being the proverbial "Martyrs to the cause", as it were, and it wouldn't surprise me if I ended up in that boat. I don't plan on committing any major crimes, but sometimes it takes just a harsh word to land your rebellious ass in a cement cell.  So I drew this stupid little picture at work last night, and it makes me giggle.  It's my sad attempt at social commentary, so take it for what it's worth.     I'll be there. Strength in numbers is strength none the less.

       (but a second to wreckit)   now that  urlLink the city regulated all the protesters to the west side highway  (a  loooong  four blocks from the garden) i think it best that we remain an "unregistered" protest.  instead of "rallying" in large groups, i advocate taking to the city in groups of twos and threes, wearing skullfuck bush on our shirts and making art everywhere we go...you know, shooting digital video and graffiti of all types, right there, in broad daylight for everyone to see.  we'll also write posts along the way, on handhelds if we have them. the goal will be to get as close as we can to the action. some of us might get arrested--some of us might get applause...we can make it so that there's no prescription beyond the desire to do original, non (physically) violent protest on an individual basis.  you know, on the subway or in starbucks.  civil disobediance, baby, however you spell it.  hang banners out of buildings, hand out a million skullfuck bush t-shirts for everyone to wear...  we can at least come up with a design and disseminate it a la obey giant "printout the pattern in this attachment" stylo.   urlLink that guy is great , btw...i wonder if his site ever accepted the link i submitted so long ago...fuck, i should email him about the party...anyway, let's do this.  come up with a design.  i like the idea of skullfuck bush appearing on it somewhere in a gothic font.  other than that, i don't know.  those of you who know something about design should take over.   urlLink angelina  weren't you already making stencils?   i love the idea of a symbol suddenly getting stencilled across the walls of cities and towns all across the world.  what do you guys think?  it would be like 12 monkees or the crying of lot 49...you would see it and you would  know   fuckit, i'm high  you guys drive...  btw that new show "LAX" looks like it's going to be good.  just the right mix of implausibility and not taking yourself too seriously.  plus i love heather locklear (shhh).  and blair underwood is in it.

           I was dreaming with a raging fever when I wrote this, forgive me if it goes astray .  I mean, I've already accepted that some of us aren't going to make it to the actual party, and there have been some articulate posts about where we do want to be and what we could be doing.  But I'm not exactly comfortable wearing a FUCK BUSH t-shirt.   I'm not comfortable with the idea that buying or wearing something is the same as doing something. But I was raised by 'skins and hippies, so what do I know.  The point is, 90 % of America- particularly the lower-middle-class- identify themselves by what they buy and wear.   We are doing here what Micheal Moore did with Fahrenheit 9-11- changing the quality of the product, not trying to change people. That makes us (that word again) not comfortable.  Young people want a loud, bright, summer movie. MM gave us one.  Americans want to support the troops by filling up a cart with crap at Costco and flying made-in-Palua flags. We love to declare our taste and judgement via a sportswear line.  I was once bequeathed an authentic WWI Field Nurse uniform. I wore to a concert that same night. A month later, I saw a row of them for sale in the window at Flip's.  Bush knew what he was doing when he told us to shop for freedom.  Why not sell a BTB version of those shirts via this site?   N8?   As for me, I'm voting dressed as a Mother of the Disappeared.  I can't make New York in August, but by October, I plan to drive across the godforsaked redneck moonscape of Arizona to do the  urlLink  post-modern Freedom Rider   thing.  More ideas at  urlLink  Fatty McBlowhard's   website.  But first, I have to get over this damn fever. I should know better than to watch CNN.    "We can not have free government without elections; and if the rebellion could force us to forego, or postpone a national election it might fairly claim to have already conquered and ruined us."     -   Abraham Lincoln

      When you think about it, people in this country like to forget about things. We forget about the latest fads, past pop stars, who finished second, etc. We only remember what we are constantly reminded of whether it be implicit or explicit.  The people of New York City are trying and moving on from September 11th. Some, like our police officers, fire fighters, emergency personnel, and bereaved families, will never forget no matter how much it pains them to remember. The majority of the people in this city go about their normal lives forgetting, for the most part, that the two biggest towers tumbled down on one of the most gorgeous mornings in any fall. Although none that were near this, or had their lives touched by this event, will ever forget in the true sense of the word.  Shortly after that day we faced another trial in the form of an airborn chemical. Many people feared riding the subways, opening mail, or even being in an office building. The fear was palpable and the threat seemed real. Yet this crime was never solved and hardly ever mentioned.   Chemical and biological weapons are a threat to humankind. They are fast and invisible killers accessible to the most ordinary people. These weapons were the main reason we were told we were going to war, yet the ones that were used against us have not been accounted for, just like the one's that aren't in Iraq.    In every speech or appearance Bush has made this month he's referenced September the 11th. On some occasions he's mentioned that day seven or eight times.    In every campaign glad-handing, expect him to exploit the death of thousands to remind people of that horrific day where thousands were killed and millions were glued to their TV sets with tears and anger and disbelief. He uses this even like it is an accomplisment he's toting, like a permanent permission slip for profiteers and the sick; a permanent excuse for preemption and lies. Permanent midnight raids and incessant agression. How dare you Mr. President, for Shame!  He will come here in over one month to  our city ; the city that was targeted due to people like him; the city that crumbled but has rebuilt. He will come here in August with speakers larger than that megaphone and he will cash-in on the biggest cash cow the world has ever seen. The profiteers have decided to bilk our city one more time and they think they will get away with it. I bet some even have a notion that they will be welcomed by ticker tape and marching bands; welcomed as liberators as we were when we freed Iraq.  But to them it may seem like a homecoming. The city is banning large protests. There will be lines drawn with cops on horses; cops with pepper spray and billy clubs; cops that are just following orders like they did when they climbed the towers, orders from men they'd rather strangle, orders from men who've lost our country's integrity and honor. These men will be in our city clogging up our bars and restaurants, taking up our parking spots, our seats on subways, and altering our commutes, safety and way of life. And they think we'll take this sitting down? They thing we'll take this without a fight?   As we are reminded by Michael Moore and Randy Rhodes et al, President Bush was a mute for seven minutes following the attacks and it makes me think that those are the only seven minutes where he hasn't exploited that event for his political gain via fear and retro-shock-therapy. He will mention our pain at every turn yet ignore the other like it never happened. He has used and abused the memories of those innocent civilians who died in a tower or on a plane for the history of others. He has and will suck every last pity point down from those who are too weak to realize his shilling and his shamelessness. His unaccountability, his arrogance and ignorance will come full circle next month.   Where is the Osama you promised us Mr. President? Is that your October surprise? Who sent anthrax through our post offices and to our politicians and papers Mr. President? Is that not terrorism? It came from within Mr. President! how can you preempt us Mr. President?  get ready

        Dans la bouche d'un vice-président des États-Unis, l'obscénité a surpris. Mais elle est dans l'air du temps.  À New York, des jeunes et moins jeunes portent des t-shirts sur lesquels on peut lire: «Fuck Bush ». À l'occasion d'un spectacle au profit de John Kerry, la comédienne Whoopi Goldberg multiplie les jeux de mots sur le nom de famille du président, qui peut évoquer en anglais le sexe féminin.      Okay, we know the revolution won't be televised.  But will it be accessorized?  The above paragraph is a pull-quote from an international 'cyberpresse'. It describes the sight of young people in New York City wearing  Fuck Bush  t-shirts.  Hmmm. I wonder if  urlLink  Neighborhoodies  would print that. They've done some kinky stuff for me...   The rest of the article is worth a look too. The title gave me my only laugh today-   urlLink "The Fear of Dick Cheney"     I'm so tired. So busy. So happy to see Sahalie (welcome back) and Liz, writing on the very topics I've been chewing on myself about...looking for  le mot juste , you know.  Laissez le bontemps roulez.....

      What is this about the so-called administration wanting to postpone elections due to a possible terrorist attack? This is no fucking joke, my darlings. Even during the nastiest depths of the Civil War our government did not postpone elections, but the (cough cough) threat of terrorism is grounds for forsaking democracy? Not even in Spain, after that dreadful terrorist attack on the trains, did the Spanish government postpone an election. I think that's what the Bushco fears most-- not a terrorist attack, but the loss of power, and not just the loss of power but a turn of the tide, as happened in Spain with the Socialist party taking control in a democratic election.   I spent the week with three serious men, an Anarcho-syndicalist, an old-school Commie, and a dyed-in-the-wool Kennedy Democrat; and they solved the problems of the world over a big bottle of red peasant wine. When those three political trends converge, we're talking about something serious they all recognize as a common thing worth fighting, something dangerous.   It's time for all the freedom loving people to ditch the rhetoric and the selected agendas and the navel-gazing identity politics and focus on the big picture-- freedom and equality and justice, not just for the big corporations, but for all of us, for every one of us just getting by, and some months not as easily as others. Poor people are starving and well-to-do people are declaring bankruptcy. The health care system and the education system are failing because they're being run as businesses and are not profitable to the big companies that contribute money to our elected officials' campaigns.   My Grandpa, a badass Communist who fought in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in the Spanish Civil War and got blown halfway to hell by a Nazi (which he says "Nazzy") fighterplane, and who later organized farm workers in California with Chavez, has always said the Big Revolution will come about faster with Republicans in the government. But he votes Democrat because there is more than one way to skin a cat.  Fuck Bush. Fuck postponing elections.  There is a massive unstoppable vehicle for change, and it is We The People. Unite.

      I was reading homey midwest sauce  urlLink N8's  post  urlLink down here  and it sort of touched on something I was touching on some time ago but never brought up.  What happens when all's said and done?  I mean after August will this site still be? Let's say justice prevails in November and Bu$h does get the proverbial skullfucking he deserves - I want this site to remain intact.  'Cause there's more evils in the world, in this country alone, than just that inarticulate turkey-in-chief. We got a great idea here: good minds meeting on a common ground. It should keep growing, it should keep expanding. (Would the two people I've invited please post something?). August could just be a launch point to commemorate the power of the original idea. Validate our efforts if you know what I mean. It can take on the form of a virtual, intellectual  urlLink Project Mayhem  of sorts. Stealing the cyberfat off cyber fat bitches' asses and cyber-selling it back to them. Stickin' it to the cyber suckas. Maybe that's a bit stretch, but I think you catch my drift.   Skullfuck Bush could be Mission One of many. The NYC bash could set it off, but party or not, concept is enough to keep me in.   Can I get an Amen?

      OK, kids—  Equivocation has a price, and come November I fear we will find out just how dear it is.     Remember this guy?  Among other things, he was the only democratic candidate to vote against the war in Iraq.  Had we not all laughed his yelping ass out of the race he might have represented a REAL ALTERNATIVE to Bush and Them.  Here we are, with the golden opportunity provided by the new Senate report that cites overwhelming evidence that the intelligence leading to the war in Iraq was deeply flawed. You don’t have to be SUN TZU or Rocky Balboa to know that the chance to strike doesn’t get much more ripe than this.  Kerry and boy wonder Edwards are trying to make the most of it, pointing out that:   urlLink  "They were wrong and soldiers lost their lives because they were wrong. And America's paying billions of dollars because they were wrong. And allies are not with us because they were wrong," Mr Kerry told the New York Times in one of several interviews with his new running mate, John Edwards, published yesterday.    Mr Edwards added: "My view is that what George Bush has done in Iraq, both in the lead-up to the war and more importantly his planning for winning the peace, has cost America dearly and cost the possibility of success dearly."     They are right, of course, but how much can they talk when they voted FOR the war?  Hindsight is 20/20, but there were plenty of us who were certain AT THE TIME that war was not the answer.  We debated against it, we shouted against it, we marched against it…and now our only choice is to vote for some pussy-ass-group-think-rich-ass-patriotic-motherfuckers who thought it was more important to go with the flow and present a strong, unified America to the rest of the world than stand up and be counted.  Now, I was never a Deanhead, or Deanite or whatever those hippies called themselves and I laughed like everyone else when he made a fool of himself…but just imagine for a minute if it was him up there right now, telling em all that he was right, that WE were right…  talk about a rally  talk about a battle cry   urlLink fuckit  it’s enough to make me scream like a stuck pig.

          Call it a reconnaissance mission of sorts. Call it sacrifice for the sake of knowledge. More truthfully, call it a broke motherfucker unable to buy his born again father a birthday present thus unable to decline a hopeful invitation to  urlLink Uprising  on account of nothing else to offer the ol' man.  The 2004 Promise Keepers conference season could be  dangerous and may not be for you . It is only for those who are ready to join an uprising -- a revolution of the soul that will change an ordinary life into an extraordinary one. It is only for those who want something more out of life, who desire to tap into the divine potential that was placed in them at their creation.      How I Got Swindled   A few years back when I lived in LA, after I got my first beatdown (if you don't know - about 80% of Angelinos have some sort of mugging story), I think I saw God for a hot second. I could have easily been killed, but I swear to you-know-who that "something" kept that knife from going a centimeter deeper into my throat.  After it all happened, the cops called the pops who was fortunately in town on some business matters. Face smashed to a pulp, ribs bruised, clothes soaked in dirt and blood from my slashed throat; call me a big nancy pussy but yeah I was shook up. Recounting the situation with him there in the ER, I went through the details, told him how when you're getting beaten by 4 cracked-out cholos with a hunting blade the adrenaline rush's so extreme that you don't feel shit; not until they knife your throat and kick you in the head, steal your asthma inhaler and then just bounce, that is.   "I can't say exactly what it was, but something kept that blade from going too deep."  "You  know  what that was, you just have to accept it.   And with that, sprawled out in a downtown LA ER in a weakened state, I myself became born again. Sneaky fucking Christians, always get you when you're down.   I started reading the Bible per my father's request: one passage per night. Reflect on it, call him once a week to discuss. Talk to God on a daily basis. When I was lonely I'd look to the ceiling of wherever I was and just rap with the big man and again, times were good.      Perpetuating The Lie   But like all 22 year olds and their loves and hates this phase phased itself out and that's all He wrote. A dusty Bible now sits by my bed and I can't remember the last time I talked to the ceiling. To keep the pops happy though, I've maintained born again status in his presence and take any and all measures to keep just to keep him happy. Crazy as he is, I love my father that much.   It's all about sacrifice, after all - and this is how I got suckered into being a Promise Keeper for the weekend.  I believe in God but I didn't always. The reasons why are personal. I am not Born Again, I am not Christian, not Buddhist and not "spiritual", whatever that means, and it's certainly not "religious." It's not a belief I feel needs justification, it's not a belief that compels me to condemn others who don't share it. It's not faith and it's not knowledge, but a feeling. I guess that's the best way to put it.   I forgot who once wrote "...trying to logic your path to God is like trying to add numbers to infinity" but it beats the shit out of the Cosmological, Teleological and Ontological arguments combined.   Well. . . maybe not Ontological, but you know what I mean.      Operation Skullfuck Jesus   God, he's cool and shit and we're on good terms still - joking terms even. For instance, he jokingly sets my life in shambles so I make jokes about his only begotten son. It's fair, right G? But the things people do in his name are fucking insane. This whole "filled with the spirit" song and dance is the quintessence of hilarity. Today even, at my Dad's rock n' roll church (I went 'cause it was his birthday today), these little kids were waving around these long streamers and dancing around the alter to the Christian rock and this one girl poked another one in the eye with her streamer stick and then she started crying. Noone even noticed since they're all waving their arms around and soaking up the spirit. Luckily the music was so loud no one could hear my laughter.   But it's not all fun song and dance - these same people wave their fingers at the rest of the world and scare themselves into believing their own hype. "Reserve your seat in heaven and recruit others for a guarantee - everyone else burns in hell" is the gist of what goes on in these sermons. Nothing short of xenophoboa, and a shade short of misogyny. This is my problem with Promise Keepers: a group reserved exclusively for Christian men that's aimed at creating world unity? A little off the topic, but also I heard another one of their beliefs is that a woman's place in the world is the "barefoot and pregnant" ideal. Though that's just heresay, I'll be able to confirm next week.  So anyways, I'm going to endure nearly eleven hours of witness and worship starting Friday night and extending into the following evening.    I'm going to learn about what God intended for me.     I'm going to learn how to discover my gifts, I'm going to learn how to use them.    I'm going to learn about things that we, as Christian men, have to deal with in a world filled with sin.   I'm going to take notes and pictures for all of you lovely bloglanders in an attempt to validate at least some time spent balls deep in 15,000 scripture-junkies. I'm going to need something to pass the time, maybe I'll even audblog the set of  urlLink Marantha , the special worship band. Get into it.   Get ready amigos, this time next week I will be extra-ordinary.  Full report coming in t-minus seven days.  (Woah, symbolic?)

       So I've been chillin' on the back-burner for a spell, just kinda livin' the gangsta life, waiting for the proper time to strike. Don't know if this is the right time, but here I am, none the less.   TRUE/sterling/Fitz, the same thoughts went through my head. But I figured it wouldn't matter if you were full of shit, cause I don't  need  a place to have a party. I'm a party all my own. Where I go, fun stuff happens. Simple as that. I don't give a fuck if I spend a bunch of money to go across the country and find out shit is a total disaster.  Entropy is fun.  Chaos in and of its self is a fuckin' parade.  I am pumped up for this sort of social aggression. I can't wait to smell the greed and deception wafting off of these elitist scum fuckers. It will incite the shit out of me.   I've been drowning myself in the anti-Bush aggression of " urlLink Houses of the Mole ", soaking up all visceral imagery of the fucked up country I live in.   I walk out the door and I see a world that disgusts me. I am overwhelmed by the shit storm.  The time is right for a fucking change.  Party or not, I'm gunna do my part.  Party or not, I'll fucking be there.  Party or not, I'll use my voice while I still have it.  Cause what's going on in this country and in this world... It's wrong.    And all bullshit aside, I plan on fighting it until I've no strength left to fight.   Regardless of friend or foe or party or not.  Because, in the end, I think this is more about standing up for what each and every one of us believes in. It's about a common ground. Commonly, we all agree that Bush is indeed a bad guy.  Maybe Kerry isn't the answer. I'm not sure he is. But it's a step. But that's not my point.   Point is, nothing is ever going to change for the better unless we throw caution to the wind and step up to the fucking plate. Nothing is ever accomplished without risk and sacrifice.   And the thought of this being bullshit or whatever, well, I'll take that risk to try to change something in this fucked up country.    "Freedom Isn't Free, and Silence is Consent!"

      An  urlLink interesting comment down below  re: the  reality  of the Skullfuck Bush party and whether it is all a giant sham on par with  urlLink BRANDTRUEBOY .  The anonymous commenter "BeenThere" from Taiwan (IP Address 61.30.47.21) proposes the scenario of folks "true to their cause" blowing their money only to show up at the designated spot and find that it's empty. Ha. Ha.  Yes, well, while it is the case that BRANDTRUEBOY is inspired by the blog credo stated elsewhere of "nothing in here is true", that does not mean that it is not REAL.  Throughout human history, folks have used fiction to tell their most intimate and compelling stories.  "The names have been changed to protect the innocent" serves to focus the reader's attention on the essence of the story that is being told, and not the personal facts of those involved, some of whom would be put in harm's way if such information was made public.  Rather than launch on a lengthy post about the importance of art and my belief that a well-conceived and written novel about a political situation has the same (or better) chance at changing the world as does a supposedly "factual" newspaper article, I'll simply post  urlLink Larry Tee's  original email to me from earlier this week.  As the particulars of this event are ironed out, the plan is to have it publicized in many places, including magazines, newspapers and websites that have nothing to do with the BRANDTRUEBOY crew.  Although it would be flattering to believe that BTB is a media conspiracy on a worldwide level, we haven't quite gotten to that point yet, so it will up to folks to judge for themselves when they read the ads whether, for instance,  urlLink the village voice ,  urlLink HX ,  urlLink motherboards  and other clubbing sources are "in on it."   Oh, and, as of now the only money that has been contributed to the cause is the $200 bucks donated by Fitz and whatever  urlLink Liz and Corinne spent to make those fabulous t-shirts (i totally want one)  Here's the email.

          FUCK BUSH.   Fabulous  idea.  I can fully support getting that self-righteous bastard out of office.  So in November I’m going to pick up my ballot and... Do what?  Vote for John Kerry? Is he really fundamentally different than Bush?  Come what may in November, an old rich white man mafia will still rule America.  The military will still be used abroad in their protection racket to make the world safe for corporate “interests”.  Real wages will still continue to fall.  Corporate executives will continue to make absurd amounts of money.   I still won’t have any fucking health insurance .  The education system in this country will still be underfunded and overcrowded.  We’ll keep building more jails instead of dealing with the causes of crime i.e. poverty, poor education, apathy, etc...  And the lower and middle classes will still be on our hands and knees so a privileged elite can climb on our backs and live their comfortable lives.    FUCK GREED  .      ...contributed by Liz and Corinne.

          (yes, I know, the title quote is from  urlLink  Stonewall   not Warriors. Your point?)  I haven't written because I'm angry that I'm not going.  I'm ashamed to admit both those things- the anger, and the not-going.  TRUE is relying on us (surely not just me) to keep this thing afloat. Reliable is the new hot, so I'm here.  But I'm confused.   We are all just standing around like we're being milked, and I can't decide why.  My gut feeling is to resist anything "anti". And the purpose of Skull Fuck Bush, title aside, is "pro" - a positive alternative to the us-against-them bullshit that is so evident on the political scene. A party to bring down the house (of Bush).   But I must say, that I don't want to be the first one to admit I chose not to go.  Reliability, you know.  I'm not a veteran, but most of my co-workers are.   And some of them are being called up this week.  One- the one whose shift I'll be covering the week of FuckBush- has a three-day-old son.  He's going back to Iraq  for the second time . And he completed his four years in the Marines in  1998 .   With all the usual mental machinations I put myself through before having any fun, I also keep thinking,  how perfect is this ?   Mom never got to go to any of the Teach-Ins that turned into Love-Ins back in the day either. She just helped plan them.  It isn't just a matter of resolving, do I get the vacation days, or do I have any cool club clothes.  But I DO NOT believe that 'actions' or protests are for other people.  This just seemed like a relevant detail. There are people who plan giant disco political subversions, and people who fill in for warriors, and we know each other.   We are the same people.  So, don't do the all-or-nothing thinking thing, kids.   Just because you might not being going to our party (and I still consider it ours), you can write. You fucking well better write here. Do you think this blog will just go away in a month? Hell no.  Just because you don't write like MadPony or Tony Pierce, you can write here. I'm doing it, fer Crissakes.  I just want to remind everyone you don't have to be Micheal Moore to be conscious.  As my son used to say , boogers are true, but so are kittens.  Someone else take the mike.....

      I listened to Eco's The Name of the Rose on the drive back from Pittsburgh yesterday. My honey kept shaking his head and making me rewind or stop the tape so he could sort out all the details of the argument between the Franciscans and the Pope. He couldn't understand how it could matter so much whether the Franciscans preached the poverty of Christ, why the Pope couldn't just let them be. He's an atheist. The thing is he really does get it. He's a smart guy. He's just a little bit idealistic about the world in a way so that when he doesn't think something  should  be that way his mind blocks his full understanding.  "Sweetie, it's a religion thing. I know you know this." "Yeah, but..." He made such a sad face as they led the young girl away to burn her at the stake for being a witch. Because a monk slept with her. "Sweetie, they used to put Quakers in prison here in America." "Really? Like in the 1700's?" "Yeah, something like that." (I'm good with the big picture more than dates of historical events. I went to a hippy private school. We did the big picture.)  By the fourth tape, I started swatting his hand away from the stereo when he reached to rewind again.  "It doesn't matter," I hissed. "The details don't fucking matter. It's just about the murders anyway."

It's: everything else.--  Henceforth, there's no arguing with these bastards.  Accuracy is easy to fake these days fair and balanced is so if it is purported (what is being reported).  The other day I was marveling pensive on the brilliance of the human brain what mush! yet, logical synopsis in synapses. (My ephedrine runs dry when dopamine  rope-a-dopes me meanly.) A rave of neurons is a sort of party crowd, i guess.   Ecstasy has robbed millions of their ability to emote.    In the movie " urlLink Awakenings ," they used dopamine to treat encephalitis lethargica -- a semi- urlLink locked-in syndrome .  Leonard was quite apt at catching balls but often turned to rage due to an inability to control his anger and ardor -- the side effects of being medicated.  His dosage kept getting increased, as did tolerance but he ventured back into nothingness and rigor back into  urlLink oblivion .   Anecdotes in film: metaphor or similar similes (like or as never had it so easy) please me in their precision.  I   envy us.   We will face Leonard's fate without the luxury of tolerance. Overindulgence is after all our M.O. (mmm. liver worst.)   The initiation has begun of the downtrodden ones  to kill the cat. Our furiosity is curious to some  --peculiar, which is synonymous-- but evident in this event for which we plan.  Rome wasn't built in a Julian day, but learning the fiddle is childs play. So Moving forward you Nero's  our objective has been exhumed  Since we are all superheroes I'll work on the costumes.

       urlLink Obliviously On He Sails  The Bush Administration in Rhyme   By Calvin Trillin  A small sample, if you please... Why yes, I will do that.    The war against Iraq: The context  The terrorism war began to sag. The perpetrator we were meant to bag Remains at large, and wartime fervor fades. Then Bush and all his Hawkish White House aids Drop sanctions as the way to tame Iraq And say, "Without delay, we must attack." If that war sags, there's still a backup plan. It's war without delay against Iran. And when the zest for that war, too, has faded? That's easy: North Korea gets invaded. But then it's hard to think of what to do. Destroy Bahrain? Bomb France? Invade Peru?  -September 23, 2002   The Loyal Opposition  The senate Democrats sat mum, Like doves afraid to coo So history will soon record This as their war too.  -April 7, 2003 --------------------------------------------------------    urlLink www.subvertise.org  --------------------------------------------------------   There is no such thing, at this date in the world’s history, in America, as an independent press. You know it and I know it.   There is not one of you who dares to write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print.  I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinion out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be so foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the street looking for another job.  If I allowed my honest opinion to appear in one issue of my paper, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone.   You know it and I know it.   And what folly is this - toasting an independent press? We are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes.   We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance.   Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men.   We are intellectual prostitutes.”   John Swinton - New York Times - New York Press Club

         This week, the U.S. Supreme court issued a historic ruling for civil liberties with its ruling on behalf of detainees and “enemy combatants” in both the Guantánamo and Hamdi cases.   The ruling is sending a strong signal to the Bush Administration that even in times of war, the government must adhere to the Constitution and the rule of law. Read more here.   Since 9/11, the Bush Administration has amassed more and more power in the name of fighting terrorism, with very little resistance from Congress, the states or the majority of the American people. In its ruling that detainees and “enemy combatants” held by the United States are entitled to challenge their detention in court, the Court rejected the administration’s arguments that its actions in the war on terror are beyond the rule of law.   This is a historic win for civil liberties and today all of us at the ACLU extend our thanks to the members and supporters who make our work possible. By speaking out and standing up for civil liberties when others remained silent, you have played a role in these victories.   “The Supreme Court,” said ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero, “today unflinchingly asserted the central role of the judiciary in determining the appropriate balance in matters of national security and civil liberties."   "President Bush and Attorney General Ashcroft have wrongly asserted that their actions in the war on terror were lawful and within the scope of the Constitution," Romero said. "Today’s decisions clearly repudiate that assertion and show that the Bush Administration’s war on terror has eroded constitutional rights and respect for the rule of law. The Guantánamo and Hamdi cases in particular reinforce longstanding notions of the rights of the detained and accused."   In another enemy combatant case, Rumsfeld v. Padilla, the Justices evaded the substantive question of Padilla’s right to counsel, saying his case was brought in the wrong venue and must be refiled in South Carolina where Padilla is being held.    urlLink To read the ACLU’s full press release on the cases, please click here.    For more news stories about the cases, please follow the links below:   urlLink  http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/06/28/scotus.terror.cases/index.html     urlLink http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2001967838_scotus29.html     urlLink http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/06/29/supremecourt/main626584.shtml       Recognizing the severe consequences of criminalizing online free speech, the Supreme Court today upheld a ban on yet another government attempt to censor the Internet.  At issue was the Child Online Protection Act, which imposed draconian criminal sanctions, with penalties of up to $50,000 per day and up to six months imprisonment, for online material acknowledged as valuable for adults but judged "harmful to minors."   "Today’s ruling from the Court demonstrates that there are many less restrictive ways to protect children without sacrificing communication intended for adults," said ACLU Associate Legal Director Ann Beeson, who argued the case before the Justices last March and earlier in 2001.   "The Court has made it safe for artists, sex educators, and web publishers to communicate with adults about sexuality without risking jail time."   Justice Kennedy, who authored the 5-4 opinion said, "Content-based prohibitions, enforced by severe criminal penalties, have the constant potential to be a repressive force in the lives and thoughts of a free people."   As a result of today’s ruling, the government could return to the lower court for a full trial.   "We urge John Ashcroft to stop wasting taxpayer dollars in defending this unconstitutional law," Beeson said. "If he insists on going back to trial, we are confident that the lower court will again find that the law went too far.”   For more news stories about the case, please follow the links below:    urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/30/politics/30PORN.final.html?pagewanted=1&hp

      I went to Italy and saw oh-so-many Venetian walls graffiti-ed with FUCK BUSH.  I thought of us.  And so, so many rainbow flags begging   PACE   PEACE   I had little tiny Quaker Meetings for Worship in my head each and every time.  But I don't know what I am doing here, really. I don't know what use I can be to the party - I am yuppie personified at this point. Does that mean I am the enemy? I don't know. Don't at least half of you young punk rockers own iPods and DVD's and digital cameras and plenty of punk rock clothing? Am I all that different just because of the Barcelona chair and the lust for built-in bookshelves? I don't know.  I feel different. I feel old and out of it. I hate staying out late because the subway doesn't run right. I don't like things to be different than usual, to be unexpected or new. I like the same old same old.  Except that I have spent four years sort of denying the reality of who was crowned president here in this country. Yeah, I went to the big old protest last year, but we left early because I didn't want my little sister to get trampled by cops and horses. Yeah, I sit in Meeting and pray for peace. Most weeks. Sometimes I am bad, though, and pray that we have enough money to pay the new mortgage or wish that those damn built-in bookshelves could hurry up and get built. Or I think about how much I want to die. I feel hopeless about more than just our country. I replay the hospitalizations and the delusional, suicidal wanderings and I feel so tired. And then I look around the room at all the "good" Quakers and feel guilty that I am so self-centered and shallow. So hopeless when I have so much.  I want to help.  I am not even thirty.  I am not old. I am not without potential.  I blog, after all.  I can try.      Entrust in me you're not alone together we'll wreak havoc on the throne -Rufus Wainwright

      Turd in a punchbowl here.   I just want to get clear on what this party will be about. What is the goal? Too many Type-A genuiuses involved here for there not to be a goal.  I'm discouraged today, not just because I can't go. I keep tripping on the reason I can't go. I'm filling in for a co-worker Reservist whose going to Iraq for the second bastard time.  I've said that here before, but MRRT isn't required reading, more like a Hometown Buffet where you can pass up the sprouts for the frozen yogurt machine. That's cool.  And TRUE is inspiring us to be part of this, no matter what we have to contribute. So, I'm giving up my discontent.  Celebrities? I did approach some. If they are big enough to reflect some wattage, they have a shitload of riders and demands. If they are small enough to be approachable, they have a way of making everything all about them.  And, goddammit, I am still aware that people are dying in that shithole. A teenager from Navajo Nation and a 26-year old Nigerian immigrant died this weekend. We didn't hear about it because we handed over Iraq, haven't you heard?  What is making my dancing shoes gather dust is this -  " You have a smaller percentage of the American public in Iraq than in any other conflict. You have a deeper detachment between the average American and the average American soldier than ever ." - from  urlLink  Operation Truth     My cousin Genaro died in Vietnam when the rest of his class had their graduation trip to NYC. My grandmother sold his cruise jacket with the dragon embroidery on ebay to pay for her heart medication. Some size-2 scenester is wearing it around Hollywood now and feeling benevolent.  I want to invite the brothers and neighbors of the 'fallen' to have free drinks and rub elbows with dyke strippers. Fuck celebrities.  If I could invite all those guys to Crobar, I would.  If there's a goal I just haven't seen, please lay it down.  Otherwise, it's just karaoake while Rome burns.

      mrtt, maaahhhn...one love, you guys.  i’ve been deep in the bat cave, brainstorming the perfect party.  puffin on fairy dust and watching the windmills of my mind turn, turn, turn, while petite korean women gently buffed my fingernails and massaged my feet.  i’ve been at st. mark’s books with the art zines.  i’ve been roaming the streets, crossing 7th Avenue during a sudden shower.  i’m taking pictures of tags and keyholes… i’m floating around cuz there’s no need to walk … i’ve driven out to the suburbs, where the stars flicker over my head, sending signals to each other, while I stand outside living room windows lit up blue and white by television…i look for the messages in the chainlink fences and the in the arrangement of plastic children’s toys on thick, hyper-green lawns and imagine that strange things are passing into my brain…chemical, cancerous things… it reminds me of when i was young, and always on the outside looking in…you’d never know by looking that ideas are spilling out of me like vomit, diarrhea and sweat.  i have a poker face.  a thousand yard stare, like maybe i’m slightly sedated, which i usually am.  i might be wearing a perfectly tailored, bland, black Dolce and Gabanna power suit, a camouflage green, Triple Five Soul tote bag and orange Ballys loafers.  no socks—chewed up leather belt…or maybe i’m in black jeans and a black hoody…i’m chewing gum by the side of the road, or i’m standing in the middle of an airport taking pictures of my blue eyes with my Treo.   find me in the club, with a bottle full of bud…   (there’s a cut above my eyebrow.  it stings from all the make-up i’ve caked on)  i’m smiling prettily and perfectly at the pigs.  i float up and down on silver elevators and golden escalators, according to instructions.    they’ve got my number; but i’ve got their dime…  i stumble back to the hotel at dawn, like i’ve been rolled against a wall of grime…     raw like sushi facts (AKA wtf i’m cold figurin on in the above rant):  sterling spoke with larry tee—she said he was very very very cool.  like  tres  cool.  like homie from round the way cool.  we can have a guest list of 500 people who will be comped and hooked up with the open bar.  we can invite more of course i just don’t think they’ll get the bar.  we have our own room but once you get in you are in the whole club (which can hold several thousand people.  errhhm)  in our room (the reed room) we can have a stage space for short 5 minute acts.  anything longer than that was discouraged by mr. tee.  we can also put up posters and fabulous people in the entrance way.  we can have a desk and shit too if we want to get political or whatever.  this is like, such an amazing opportunity and you are ALL a part of it with me…so get deep like i am put on yr purple shades smoke a ton of herb, dance do some yoga drink wheat grass red wine…whatever it takes i need some NEXT from everyone.  doyouknowwhati’m sayin?  this is like, the fer real meaning of SKULLFUCKBUSH—to get deep witit.  to leave the slick cnn surface of things and get into the nitty gritty.  to boogie and carry on in face of a republican invasion, just in case anyone forgot for a second that we were in nyc.  to be outrageous, high and happy—camping it out with art and video games and sneakers and political messages on websites and camera shots of people getting pushed down, discouraged, shut-up…  gassed…beaten…arrested…if shit comes to that, we’ll be there…   urlLink theyesmen  are coming.  we are trying to get a local thrift store like Beacon’s Closet in Brooklyn to hook us up with fucked-up jackets and button downs so these dudes can crash the party dressed as republicans.  it’s so perfect because in the main room it’s the hooker’s ball so it would make sense that a bunch of drunken, horny delegates might show up at the club.  i’ve got a friend trying to get 'the slanty eyed bitches' and another friend working on a certain famous drag queen who will for now remain nameless:  i want to secure raymi for five minutes worth of karaoke at different points throughout the evening.  speaking of which i need somebody to drive up with me to Canada to pick up  urlLink raymi  and  urlLink whoever else  from the greater t-dot area who wants to come to the party  i also need someone to help me with invites.   i want to individually ask some very special people to attend our event.  rock stars and cool kids  like chloe sevigny  and   i don’t know  who else?  Werner Herzog  Jay-Z?  sofia coppola?  the drunk skater kids from down the street?  the iPod dudes from Other Music?  the kids @ Ground...  (oh it goes on and on)   i want to charm them with a personal gift/invite…  courtesy of BRANDTRUEBOY©  a More Reservoir Than Tarantino Production.  for this i’m going to need yr help, kids…  I need fliers   i need art  i need mix CDs and t-shirts  they can be simple and plain  here are the facts:  SKULLFUCKBUSH!

         some asshat posted in raymi's comments about how porn should be taken off the 'net and they're all sinners and then they posted as george bush and also linked to a fucking christian propoganda site - cc.org - f. to. that.  so she checks the ip and the ip is in fact from washington, kentucky actually. pffft.  now raymi doesn't get political for a reason, too many paranoia traps in her mind, in her life.  yah yah bush is thee wartime pres. ok good and kerry has the pizzaz of a sack of potatoes.  so what do we do?  why couldn't clinton be pres. why couldn't jfk?  these things wouldn't be happening.  sinners? Excuse me asstwat, christians ain't supposed to be vengeful peoples who use scare-tactics and get kids to start blogs to try and be all cool-in-your-face and invite you over for slumber-party weekends and send you home with a boggle game in your brains.  me and raymi be raised catholic ok. and when it comes to christianity and catholicism there is a big fucking difference. catholics didn't fucking hate on mary and totally ignore her ass in that whole thing.  any and all religion is hogwash but faith is mighty good.  like dude, don't put rules on people and tell them they are messed-up mistakes if they be your savior's "creation" if they're homosexuals or rapists or glass-eaters.  you fuckedup, fine, flood the fucking earth again.  oh wait that never happened. it was just a story that noah dude and his animals two of each. and adam and eve as well, never fucking happened. who told me that? favorite and lastest religion teacher before we left the catholic school system and he was a camel-effer and he told us don't take the bible literally, it is all garbage, every story in it is bullshit, he swore and told us about how he took craps and read magazines, seriously... AND he had a BA in religion too.  anyway, all them stories are there just to show that god is almighty and powerful and head-honcho.  i'm gonna start my own religion. it's called, get a clue.

          Reasons why we need to support Kerry, and not just get rid of Bush, part III is a series ; -Kerry is the only viable opponent. He's what there is. Deal. (edited to add - He  urlLink  gives a shit   about your voting rights.) Reasons why you should be possessed with an insane desire for vengence at the way we've been punked by Team Bush; -According to  urlLink  The Writing on the Latrine Walls  , William Rivers Pitt, the Project for a New American Century had  urlLink  plans   as early as 2000 to fabricate a premise for war with Iraq.  In 2000, the membership was relatively power-less,"...preshensile gnomish powerplayers scuttling back to their right-wing think tanks, after being too crazy even for Bush 1", according to one source.  Impressive roster, though. Dick Cheney, Vice President of the United States, former CEO of Halliburton;  Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense;  Paul Wolfowitz, Deputy Secretary of Defense;  Elliot Abrams, National Security Council;  John Bolton, Undersecretary for Arms Control and International Security;  I. Lewis Libby, Cheney's top National Security assistant.  Reasons why this gang went from Washington footnote to Mordred Impersonators: -Hanging chads, corrupt justices and a ball-less Senate.  Stated goals of the 'Project'- "The invasion and occupation of Iraq, for reasons that had nothing to do with Saddam Hussein. The building of several permanent military bases in Iraq, the purpose of which are to telegraph force throughout the region. The takeover by Western petroleum corporations of Iraq's nationalized oil industry. The ultimate destabilization and overthrow of a variety of regimes in the Middle East, friend and foe alike, by military or economic means, or both."  The headline from the Najaf latrine wall, reported by a wildcat embedded journalist and told to Pitt- -"The troops aren't hunting terrorists or building a country," said the Reuters photographer. "All they do is guard the convoys running north and south. The convoys north are carrying supplies and empty tankers for the oil fields around Mosul and Tikrit. The convoys south bring back what they pull out of the ground up there. That's where all these kids are getting killed. They get hit with IEDs while guarding these convoys, and all hell breaks loose."   An estimated 50 to 70 % of American casualties, amputations and disfigurements, in addition to deaths,occur on the convoy detail protecting oil for the United Subsidiaries of Halliburton.  Quick review- did this group fail in meeting all its goals?  930 Americans and thousands of Iraqis dead. No weapons of mass destruction. No connection between Al Queda and Saddam. No established democracy. No rebuilt infrastructure. No rose petals in the path of the 'dumb, racist jackasses" handpicked by 'contractors' to shoot at any Iraqi kid or old lady who gets in the way of the oil.  I'd have to give all those a failing grade.  One goal is more than met, however.  While your wife's job has been shipped offshore, and your son's health insurance has been cut from your policy, and your mother's prescriptions have tripled in cost,  Halliburton and its sister company has been counting up the bucks with hands dripping with blood;    "According to the Center for Public Integrity, Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown & Root has made $11,475,541,371 in Iraq as of July 1. So that's one PNAC goal checked off the list."      That's not all Iraqi oil money. That's cash coming out of the future of your children and grandchildren to pay for this neo-con fuckaround.  Reasons why this makes me mad,  1) Nobody asked my opinion. 2) I might have other plans for that 11 billion. 3) I would rather be laying in bed with a pile of s'mores reading I, Robot, than feeling driven to write this stuff.  Now, there's an ending I could cheer.  In the meantime, can't anybody agree to help me to get these losers out of our White House?  Even if you have to hold your nose and vote? Don't make me quote Jim Morrison.

       NEW YORK -- In an unprecedented series of concerts in nine swing states, more than 20 musical acts — including Bruce Springsteen, Pearl Jam and the Dixie Chicks — will perform fund-raising concerts one month before the Nov. 2 election in an effort to unseat President Bush.  The shows, which will begin Oct. 1 in Pennsylvania, will take an unusual approach: as many as six concerts on a single day in cities across the states expected to decide the November presidential race.   Other stops on the tour are North Carolina, Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Wisconsin and the key state in 2000, Florida.  "We're trying to put forward a group of progressive ideals and change the administration in the White House," Springsteen told The Associated Press in the most overtly political statements of his 30-year career. "That's the success or failure, very clear cut and very simple."  The artists of different generations and genres will tour under the name "Vote For Change," with shows Oct. 1-8. But the money generated will go to America Coming Together, which promises on its Web site to "derail the right-wing Republican agenda by defeating George W. Bush."  The anticipated millions of dollars will be spent in the swing states before the presidential election, said ACT president Ellen Malcolm.  The shows will be presented by MoveOn Pac, the electoral arm of the liberal interest group MoveOn.org, with an official announcement expected Wednesday.  There was no immediate word on prices for tickets, which were going on sale for all shows Aug. 21. The shows will pair artists, such as Springsteen and or the Dixie Chicks and James Taylor. There will be 34 shows in 28 cities.  Natalie Maines, of the Dixie Chicks, who memorably told a London audience last year that she was ashamed to share her home state of Texas with Bush, echoed a Springsteen comment that this was the most important election of their lives.  "A change is in order," Maines said. "There's never been a political climate like this, which is so the polar opposite of me as a person and what I believe in."  The idea was hatched by several of the acts' managers, and quickly expanded. "Once we started talking to each other, ideas started percolating and other artists started reaching out to us," said Jon Landau, Springsteen's manager.  Other artists participating in the shows include hip-hoppers Jurassic 5, John Mellencamp, Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Browne, Babyface, Bright Eyes and the Dave Matthews Band. Most have a history of social activism, from Browne's anti-nuclear concerts to Mellencamp's Farm Aid shows. Pearl Jam front man Vedder was a Ralph Nader backer in 2000.  "At some point, you can't sit still," said Vedder, a harsh critic of the Iraq war. "You can't spend your life, when people are getting killed, without asking serious questions about why."  Springsteen said he didn't fear any backlash over going public with his personal politics.  "It's a pretty clear-cut decision in November," said Springsteen, whose songs have provided a backdrop for some Kerry events. "We're chipping in our two cents. That's all we're trying to do."

       urlLink        WOW.  I can't belive nobody put me onto  urlLink Achewood  before now. This is the best shit I have ever seen online. Except for that porno site that was set up mock-gonzo style and it's all "border guards" making illegal mexican immigrant women suck their cocklers or else they deport them. That shit was good, but Achewood is also good.

      Burning Man/NYC Mailing List forwarded me this.   Yo!  Where were you? I only was there on Friday.  The city of Boston built a pen with fencing and barbed wire.  There was a microphone with a speaker facing an empty parking lot.  Maux with the big mouth was the only one who was heard.  Most of the people there were Kucinich fans and wacko conspiracy peeps. There was a small Vienam Vets against Kerry march and once cute old man with flags and Bush signs trying to stay conscious.  A group of us put on black hoods and tied out hands behind our backs. (Remember, my friends, the Dems voted for the Patriot Act.)  All in all, the cops were very cool, even with their riot gear.  They were tired and working overtime.  Then Faux took the stage in the pen.  I am loud, so the Conventioneers could hear me.  The Conventioneers were casually waling in after 2PM in thier suits, after a night of partying with movie stars and Al Sharpton.  (I tried to get into the NY Delegation Party, but the organizer told the cops that I was trying to "buy" a ticket.  The cop told me to leave.)  So the Conventioneers were coming in and for a half hour, I haranged them.  "Why did you put a knife into the beatiful Social Security System.  Why? Why?"  I cried.  Some stopped to listen.  (If you recall, they tried to fillibuster the evil "drug benefits" bill, but some Dems didn't even bother to show up to vote!)  "How could you do this to me?"  "to us?"  (They duped the AARP and the damage has been done.)  Social Secuity is on a privatization track.  "The Social Securoty System was so beautiful. Perfect.  How could you?  "The PR about SSA running out of money is a LIE. You know it is!"   Some actually agreed.  "The Patriot Act.  I went to the doctor two weeks later and WAS TOLD that my medical records were now public record.  I was not 'asked' to agree.  I was told!  HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?"   I cried some more.  I admitted in front of cameras and video that I can not see a psychiatrist now because it is no longer safe to do so.  "My psychiatric history could be used against me!"  More tears.  I hate shrinks anyway, but I got a few of them to stop and listen.  I guess they never thought of that!  BIG PLUG  Ruben Zamora came INTO the pen and spoke to me.  He is running against Dennis Hastert, the EVIL SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE!  Ruben Zamora, http://www.rubenforcongress.org  Ruben represents the 14th District of Illinois....so pass this on to your IL friends.  Get this guy elected.  This man gave me hope.  Hastert's website has the info on the toens and cities in the 14th District.  http://www.house.gov/hastert/district.shtml  Ruben website is a mess.  Let's hope for HOPE.  MY THOUGHTS ABOUT RNC PROTEST...  I am still trying to swallow the DNC experience.  When I come up with a good idea....  P.S.  I had a poster reading "Who's Next" stuck on my chest while in the hood and chains. I also cried out "Boobs Not Bombs!"  Hundreds of photos were taken.  If you see one, send it on....  heh!  I am loving you.  Let's make it happen!  Peace and love,  faux  Faux Maux   - Worthiness of mention to be determined......

      I just wanted y'all to see two little sentences that appeared in an AP story today:     The city now has 4,000 fewer police than on Sept. 11, 2001, and this year New York was given $5.47 per head in homeland security grants -- the second lowest in the nation.   This is certainly pretty far from the money we were promised after 9/11. Take into account the amount of Firehouses closed and Firemen let go, we are virtually defenseless. I guess I'm going to have to don my superhero costume again. go go gadget roller skate rocket feet and omnicscience!

       urlLink    Sorry I won't be there. May Bush be fucked in his ape-man skull while Cheney devours his rectum full of oil and cum with his jagged, forked Satan tongue. May Rice, the black goat of the forest with a thousand young, expose her swollen demon-goat teets, all six hundred and sixty six of them, for the horned beast Bushalathotep to suckle and know great power from its venom. May Dark Rumsfeld be devoured on the hoary alter of syphilis while the other White House Ghouls Burn one hundred dollar bills in effigy of their fallen slothmaster, AzaRagen. May the tepid lifeblood of Yog Sobush seep from the engorged genitals of Dick Cheney... Or... Heh... Uh...  Yeah...

      Seems that I will not be able to go to RNC.  It's about 90% likely I will not be able to go to the party or New York, period.  This is because of my arrest.  I am dumb. I got arrested. I am going to get a stiff fine.  So... I currently cannot leave state. My court date is on the 23rd. If my case is continued, I won't be able to leave state, again, until my case is finished. Then, I have to ask permission to leave state, which they may or may not allow.  If my case is closed, dropped, complete on that date, I will have the stiff fine to pay which I will not be able to miss work because of.  I do not get paid time off. Any time I miss, I don't get paid for. A whole week is a lot of money. With a potential fine of up to $1,000 - I can't afford to miss work.  My friend that was going to drive... He's going into the hospital at the end of august to have cameras shoved down his gullet. Driving will not be something he's able to do.  Fuck, this sucks.  I hope hope hope that I am able to find a way, but as of now I am trapped.  I hope it's fun.  I love ya'll, but for now I am just a written participant.
