      I complain a lot.  About nearly everything, but I don't consider myself a negative person. :)  Really.  I've considered working on this - most people grow weary of someone who constantly complains.  But not today.  I mean - I won't work on that problem today.  Some of you may have thought it was rude of me to complain about what my mom fixed for dinner.  Hey - she cooked, get over it.  And there is a part of me that feels that.  I have about 3 meals I can cook and I rotate them.  We order pizza at least once a week and the girls usually talk me into McDonalds at least once a week - so we have our own version of variety around here.  The pyramid of food groups crashes and burns.  Nutritionists throw back their heads and wail at the horror.  Where was I?  Complaining about my mom.    My mom is a great cook.  And she is one of those people who can whip together a great meal when you think you have no food in the house.  She is very creative that way.  I'm not creative.  And I say it is best that an accountant is not creative.  It isn't encouraged.  Although I suppose being creative in the kitchen isn't unethical.  Or the bedroom.  I *can* be creative there, come to think of it.  Ok.  Not really.  I get new techniques from watching porn or reading erotic stories on line.  I'm a copycat.  And porn isn't really allowed around these parts and since I have small children I've thrown everything remotely tacky looking away.  Thank God for the internet, I say.   So I am pleased that she cooks, but the price I pay is higher than I really am happy with.  I'd prefer to eat spaghetti for every meal this next year, given that choice.    Speak of the devil.  I'll continue this line of thought later.

      Well.  This is fun, this blogging.  Now I don't have to worry about being labeled "obsessed" by hags from hell (heh heh) or that my emails are too lame and my friends dread seeing my name in their inbox.  Ok.  I never worry about the latter.  My friends accept me when I'm lame or entertaining, so no worries there.  I'm actually just glad I can channel my need to share to this space right now instead of hda.  You're sick of hearing about him already.  I don't care.  I tend to go on a bit.  It's my way.  I'll move on eventually.    Today was Memorial Day.  The daycare used to be open and it was one of my few free days a year - alas, they now close.  So I just stayed home all day.  A website I linked earlier has old songs on it - the lyrics are listed and most of them have the music as well.  The music is usually like that organ playing stuff they have on the SNL skit with the couple who sings contemporary songs in a polka style or some such thing.  But my girls and I are easily entertained.  For the past 6 or 7 months we've hardly missed a weekend where we didn't go to that website.  I pick out the songs and sing and they dance (jump) on my bed - the four year old doing "shows" for me.  One of our favorites is Squeeze Box (The Who).  I love that song.    My mom is here getting on my last damned nerve.  I'll never be able to make this blog into a book - what with married men talk and now family bashing.  But I need to vent.  She fixed cubed steak, mashed potatoes and green beans (and a salad) for dinner.  Which is mostly fine for me - I said potatoes, but I never mean mashed.  I think that is a super boring way to eat potatoes.  But she didn't fix anything for the girls to eat - she expected them to eat that.  They are four and two.  The four year old will sometimes eat green beans, but lately won't.  And the two year old ate some mashed potatoes.  I said something to my mom about it and she said "if they refuse to eat, they'll get hungry enough and will eventually eat what you serve."  I hate it when she talks like that.  What is this?  The fucking army?  Why make life so unhappy EVERY SINGLE DAY?  I see no point in that.  So what a four year old won't eat cubed steak.  So they didn't eat and now that means they won't sleep well and then she'll (mom) be mad at me because everytime they cry during the night it wakes her up.  She has been unemployed for most of the past 3 years.  And a significant portion of that time we've lived together.  It only takes a short amount of time for us to not get along, so you can imagine the hell it becomes when it is long term.  She always ends up practically hating me and my kids and leaves without even saying goodbye, tearing off down the road without looking back.  And my feeling is always "good riddance."  I think God is punishing me by making me spend so much time with her.  I end up paying all of her bills - and I'm not exactly rolling in the dough.  People at work discuss their investments and wonder why their accountant has none - and I think to myself that I invest in my family.  I once had hopes that it would come back to reward me - but this past year had me nearly penniless and the sisters that I bailed out of financial jams for the last 7 years gave me no money, wouldn't even offer their personal help when I needed help moving and/or watching my girls (daycare was running $1000/month).  One of my sisters (I have 3) did help - but she and her husband aren't exactly rolling either, so it strained them to help me.  To her I am forever grateful.  Now.  If they would only take my mom in.... ;)  They left the country for 4 months (long story).  CONVENIENT, I say...

       urlLink This  has been a song on my mind for about 4 months.  I recently found a  urlLink blog  with that as the title - very interesting writing.  The song reminds me very much of my hda.  Those initials actually do mean something - and he would recognize them.  It is rather an insult, but I called him that from time to time without offense.  His father died last October (in the song the father dies) and he was suicidal even before that.  His father was his very best friend - even Friday when we talked he told me countless stories about his dad and said not a day goes by that he doesn't think about him and miss him.  He is also close to his mother and his mother feels a void that no one can ever replace.    I wish I was a nicer person - but I'm simply not.  I'm glad that his wife is jealous of me and threatened by me.  And I think all of the events of the weekend actually work in my favor. I think it will speed up a divorce, not avoid one.  Of course, if he divorces and doesn't ask me out - then I will be heartbroken.  If ever I thought someone was my soulmate, it is him.  I'm not one to overly believe in such things - I read about couples who sound that way.  I don't know any of them personally and have NEVER had an experience remotely close to it.  But my hda.  I've been crazy about him for 10 years and to know he is also attracted to me.  Well.  That is an amazing thing.  From the beginning of our email friendship I decided to be myself and honest - figuring if he didn't like who I was it didn't matter.  Being what you think someone wants is usually fruitless because eventually you have to be who you really are.  And I think I'm too old to want to play that game and get my feelings hurt when they realize I'm not all that they hoped.  And he has liked who I really am the entire time.  We've made each other mad, don't get me wrong, but always resolvable.  If I tell you I love him I'll deny it if you tell him. :)  K

      I have to confess, I'm nearly a virgin in the blogger world.  Ok.  You got me - only in blogger world am I that. :)  Speaking of sex.  That's a more entertaining topic than my current theme, isn't it?  My hda and his wife rarely do the nasty - but I think my hda is impotent (because he resisted the likes of me...and we'll have to guess it is only because he couldn't perform, right?!?  not that maybe he actually had a moral code he follows?)  I was late in life with all of it.  I was of the saving sex for marriage frame of mind.  But when I was 29 and still a virgin I pretty much decided I had done my part and God let me down, so it was time to just take matters into my own hands.  Well.  Actually that's where they had been until that time, and I put them in someone else's. ;) ha  I've polled many of my friends on it - thinking real world answers are more honest than what I read from strangers.  But I didn't really get the answer I wanted.  I think even kissing the right person can take you to another place - and sex can be even better.  But my boyfriend doesn't do that - and I wonder if we have no chemistry - if it is me - it is him - or if I'm wanting something that is romantic nonsense.  I think this feeling of always being somewhat unfulfilled is why I find my interest often wandering.  Well, that and thinking my current boyfriend isn't smart enough.  That's mean of me - but he isn't going to read this and we won't tell him I said that.  He isn't stupid - but smart?  He is not.  My hda - obviously, very smart.  Writes well.  Very funny.  And something about him has drawn me to him since the day I met him.  My senses are on high alert when he is around - if he was my man - I'd be fucking his brains out as often as possible.  The idea that he and his wife do it once or twice a year boggles my mind.  I think how can she resist him?    I've actually sent him mixed messages for about a year.  The thing is, I'm crazy about him - every single thing (oh, well, that being married thing I'm not so crazy about that).  But I really don't want to sleep with a married man or mess up a marriage - especially one with children.  So sometimes I make inappropriate suggestions and other times I rail against the type of people who cheat on their spouses.  Both are real feelings I have, just depends on the time of the month. :)  Now one of my friends is convinced his wife will storm my office at work and confront me.  I found that to be a ridiculous idea.  I've never even touched hda - not kidding.  Even Friday when we were alone he sat on one side of the table, I was on the other and we talk.  That's all we do.  Eye contact.  Plenty of that.  But not even brushing up next to him walking out the door.  So what would she confront me with?  (ok, my countless emails, but I'm praying to the internet gods that he deleted all of them)  But my friend pointed out that his wife may not choose to believe we've never messed around.  She may have blown it all out of proportion in her mind.  I hope my friend is wrong.  But if it happens, it happens.  All I can do is deal with it as it comes.  But I think if she does - I'm entitled to one night of passion with her husband.  Right?  Are you with me?!? :)  I'm kidding.  Of course I'm kidding.  My boyfriend is on IM and keeps asking me if I'm still there.  Guess I should pay him some attention.

      I told my boyfriend part of the hda story today - leaving out key points - but the gist was all there.  He said if hda lets his wife control him to that degree, they will never be happy.  This week it is giving up my emails, next week it'll be something else and the week after, something else.  Then he said he'd never let a woman control him like that.  I was telling my mom about it and her eyes got big at that last comment - as I can be difficult when I don't get my own way.  I said "well, he lets me be me" and she said "yeah, but he won't marry you either."  Was that really necessary?  I think in nearly every conversation we have she finds something completely negative and rude to say about me.  The indication was that if I wasn't so controlling, I'd be married by now.  (because of course, the key to ultimate happiness is marriage - let's take a poll of all the married people we know, i'm sure they'd agree)  I just ignored her.    When she got here last Sunday within the first hour she had made a disparaging comment about my hair (too flat, need a perm).  All I can say is the last time she gave me a perm I looked like a female version of carrot top - and nothing says "i'll never have sex again" like a female version of carrot top.  So.  I'll stick with the flat 'do.    I've got a preschooler and a toddler expecting attention.  So my little turning world stories will have to wait.  This afternoon I'm amused and sort of interested in seeing how this all plays out next week at work.

      This is my email response to hda's dismissal of me as his friend (sent to his work email - so his staff will know, but not necessarily the wife):  "I feel like you got to say your thing and in my mind, I at least get to respond before I just walk away.    I really don't like being labeled as "obsessed."  Especially by C - as a medical doctor her labels carry more weight than someone else's.  She's still a wife who is mad and putting me down is a normal reaction.  I have my doubts that you defended me - so this is how I perceive things - my own defense:  I write a lot - it is who I am.  I also talk a lot, but you and I don't talk, the only way we've communicated up until Friday (for the most part) is through email.  If I write everyday or 5 times a day, I don't think that is odd.  If you are friends, you communicate.  You want them to know what is going on with you and you want to know what is going on with them.  J and I pop our heads into each other's office 2 or 3 times a day to catch up and touch base.  Sometimes work, sometimes personal.  My mom and I talk on the phone nearly every day - and sometimes several times a day.  My boyfriend calls no less than four times a day - and if he is bored, he'll call once an hour.  When my friend M was working on his Master's degree he was often depressed - for about a year he called me every day and talked for hours in addition to writing me 2 or 3 letters a month.  I'm sure if email had been around then he would have emailed me all the time.  When my friend T was in town we talked on the phone all the time and spent most of our free time together.  I don't qualify any of this behavior as obsessive - I just think friends communicate.  Sometimes more than other times - and some friends are more verbose than others.  It is a reflection of their personality - not a sign of a personality disorder.  Obsessive in my mind suggests that I was acting inappropriately.  And I know teasing you about sex was inappropriate given that you are married, but the action of emailing often is not.  If you had asked me to stop and I continued, unable to control myself - I think that would qualify.   Maybe suggesting I'm obsessed is even a double insult - I have a personality disorder and you can only attract women who are emotionally unbalanced.    The way I've pictured our friendship in my head this past year is that you've been holding my hand.  No matter what is going on in my 'real' world, I've known I've got you in the background, holding my hand, listening to me babble.  Making me feel like it would all be ok.  I can certainly channel my "obsessive" writing in another direction, but I will miss you very much.   And your friendship was about the only thing keeping my head above water during some dark times in X and for that, I am very thankful.  I hope things work out the way you want."

      Some of my girlfriends have suggested that hda was using me - letting me write what I wanted, clearly attracted to him so his wife would read it and see him through someone else's eyes - and perhaps realize what she has and appreciate it more.  I don't know about all of that, but I'm not discounting it.  The thing is - without him in my life this past year, I'm not sure where I'd be.  He was suicidally depressed the first time he wrote me and I knew not to take it as an off-hand comment.  I took him seriously and felt like it was the right thing to do to offer my friendship to him.  We lived 4 states apart and email was it.  I didn't know it at the time, but my life would hit the skids as well within a month or so of his first email.  I'm not the kind of person to ever feel suicidal.  I don't care how bad things are or how horrible I feel - I know it will eventually get better.  Life is a constant cycle - sometimes it's good, sometimes it's great, sometimes it is so-so and sometimes it is just plain shitty.  I figure if you off yourself during the shitty times you are depriving yourself of the good and great times ahead.  Besides being a supremely selfish thing to do, but that is neither here nor there at the moment.  I was as depressed as I had ever been in my life - details I will not get into now.  But they are horrific enough that when and if I share them, you will understand I was not overreacting to my environment.  His emails were the only bright spot in my life for several months.  Knowing this man that I had had a crush on for nearly 10 years deemed me worth keeping in touch with and calling a "friend" was very buoying to my spirit and self-esteem.  The mental image I have of it is that he was holding my hand while I was going through a rough time.    Moving here and seeing him and working for him has been a little strange - in the sense that when you know someone on a different level online than you ever knew them before in person - seeing them again is well, strange.  I wasn't ever able to relax and babble in front of him the way I did in my emails, but it wasn't uncomfortable and we could talk easily.  Again: never even hinted at anything inappropriate.  Meeting him Friday was the first (and now only) time I've ever been alone with him and even then we were in a very public place with lots of people around.    I don't know what has gone on specifically lately with his wife, but he had told me before she felt threatened by me.  I found that odd and hard to believe.  I'm hardly a 20 year old hottie.  I wouldn't even say I'm a 38-year old hottie.  I look like someone you knew in high school or college and you thought they were nice.  A good person.  I have people all the time think they know me or maybe I'm a sister of someone they know or something.  They don't say: "Liz Hurley?! Is that really you?!" More like: "you were friends with my brother, weren't you?" or "we had history together, right?" Like a vague nice person you once knew.  Except.  You know.  I'm really not nice.  I seem nice.  I appear to be nice and quiet, shy and the kind of person you would ask for help if you needed it in a crowd.  And I would help and act nice.  I'm better with strangers than the people closest to me.  How did I get here?  I wasn't talking about me, I don't think.  All I know is I have tried to stop writing him in the past.  Not because he asked me to - but because I thought it would be in my own best interest.  Spending so much time and energy invested in someone who is not yours and will never be yours isn't wise.  I didn't want to set myself up to be hurt.  But every time I wouldn't write for a week or two I would get very depressed again.  I can't explain it, but pouring out all my thoughts to him knowing he didn't judge me harshly no matter what I said kept my spirits up.  I've shed a few tears today - but like I said before, I don't think it is over.  But it very well could be over.  Experience tells me it isn't, but life can be unpredictable.  I won't write him, I won't turn into some kind of weird psycho stalker chick.  I won't make up lame "professional" reasons to get in touch.  I can be a reasonable person when I put my mind to it.  I just have not wanted to be reasonable where he is concerned.  Now it is the only prudent thing to do.  I had a fleeting thought of telling my boss (ceo) that I could no longer attend the Friday meetings with hda.  In the past the person in my role did not attend these meetings.  I attended one during my first couple of weeks at the job and they both found my insight helpful and decided they wanted me to always be there.  I was pleased to be included with the 'big dogs' weekly meeting.  And the truth is, I do think it is valuable for me to be there.  And I do like my job and want to do the best job I can.  To avoid the meetings just to prove to him or to myself that I don't need to see him really only hurts me career wise.    After re-reading his email to me (and overanalyzing it the way I do every single thing that happens to me) I think it is possible he isn't planning on giving up my friendship.  Just the emails.  On the other hand, emails are 99% of how we communicate, so maybe I'm reaching here.  But he said we could talk on Fridays at the meeting and at first I felt like "well, jeez, thanks your majesty for ALLOWING me to speak to you" but now I think maybe he meant we could catch up on personal things during that time as well.  We've never talked personal things at the meetings before - but maybe he thinks we can start.  If that's the case, I'm not sure how I feel about it.  I mean.  His wife's point is that he abandon the friendship - that is what threatens her.  Our method is email and what she's told him we have to stop.  If he simply thinks we can by-pass it by skipping emails and talking face-to-face I think that violates the spirit of what she is asking and is more the letter of the law interpretation.  I don't like that.  Game-playing crap.  Be friends with me, don't be friends with me - but don't finagle a way to let her think we aren't but we are.    I'm getting annoyed at him for my own speculations.  It's my way.  My boyfriend is certainly used to that.  He's told me before when I was angry with him that I could handle both sides of the argument and to let him know who wins when I'm finished.  (and naturally, I'm always right, so I always win)  And my boyfriend.  He is out of town.  He called me today and said "I was so depressed all day yesterday and I had no idea why." And I was feeling guilty because yesterday I was Kristina and the Waves "Walking on Sunshine" all the way downtown to meet my doctor for drinks.  My boyfriend is feeling better today - and unbeknownst to him, the slight threat to our relationship is no longer a threat at all.  I'm sorry if all this talk isn't what you want to hear.  I have to say - I need the outlet right now.  My mom is visiting and is very Southern Baptist and as you can well imagine, my pining over the loss of a friendship of a man I have a crush on who is married is not a topic she thinks needs discussing.  http://users.cis.net/sammy/rflack.htm

      Been dwelling on being dumped as a friend by my doctor friend.  Like a lightswitch.  Men can be like that.  I don't know many women who can be like that - not that we can't get to that point -but it isn't (usually) easily or quickly reached.  This particular situation is an odd one. Truth of the matter is, I've been expecting an email like he sent for awhile now.  The part of me that enjoys a good story is pleased, because it means a key moment has occured and the story can pivot in many possible ways.  The one C is hoping for is a return to her marriage the way it was a year ago - when hda was suicidally depressed and she was in control of everything.  This past year he has gained an upper hand and asserted more control.  That in itself has improved the marriage because it has been more equal and she has had to try harder.  But he won't go back to being the way he was.  This I do know.

      Email from my hda:  "C and I had a bit of a fight last night.  I had told her I would be home around 4:30 or 5 and she said she would probably not be home until six.  She knew I had no meeting with ceo because I already told her.  When I got home later she asked where I was and I told her I had a meeting with you, our accountant, which had been arranged after I talked with her.  Between that and the volume of e-mails sent by you, she basically said she does not want any communication between us other than professional.  That was the fight.  She knows I have very few friends, and I was not happy that she does not trust me.  She said she does trust me, but based on what she has seen in the volume of e-mails (not content, I delete messages as I read them) she believes that you are "obsessed."  She feels this is a detriment to our marriage, because right or wrong, she feels threatened and it is very troubling to her.  She asked that I write and tell you no more communication outside the realm of professional contact.  I told her that if she feels strongly enough to decide who I can be friends with, don't be gutless- write you herself.  She plans to do that.  She also said she will only do that with my blessing.  Not an ultimatum, but for the good of our marriage.  We have made too much progress to go back, and most of the progress has been on her part.  It is now time for my contribution - your e-mails.  Therefore I gave her "my blessing" to contact you. Since this would mortify you both, I will tell her that I took care of it.  Fun and friendly banter in otherwise professional communications is fine, and we can talk at our Friday meetings with ceo.  Otherwise - sorry.  You are clever and witty with excellent insights.  That is why I enjoy most of your e-mails, but in the words of the Underdog narrator 'Looks like this is the end...'"  My thinking is that like on Underdog - it is never the end.  But I will stay out of the way.  I think he will resent her forcing this and it will not strengthen the marriage, but send it more quickly to the demise it is already set upon.  Mostly I think it is a good thing.  And I'll channel my "obsessive" writing to my blog instead of him.

      I guess it is time to cut the crap and just get personal here.  I prefer to keep this blog towards the lighter end - funny stories about my kids or life in these united states.  But today.  Damn.  It's a very long story which I should back up and tell, but where I'm at today is where I'll begin.  I took a new job about 2 months ago.  I knew about the job from a friend of mine who used to be my doctor.  He hasn't been my doctor for a couple of years and I've known him about 10 years.  Our friendship hasn't violated any ethical code that I can think of.  Not that I haven't wanted it to.  I think it is fairly common to fall in love with your doctor - they shown concern for your well-being during times when you aren't at your best and it is easy to translate that concern into more than it really is.  Florence Nightengale effect or something like that.    His company was looking for someone with my background and I did interview with their CPA firm and out of a huge pile of candidates, I was their top pick.  (actually all of this happened last Fall and I was offered the job and turned it down - but in February the guy who took the job gave his notice so they let me know and this time I accepted it)  I moved back to the area for this job - and to work for my doctor friend who I'm half in love with.  And he knows that.  No secrets with me.    Every Friday I meet with him and my immediate boss (my doctor friend is the president of the company, my boss is the CEO of the company).  We meet at a bar downtown and discuss how things are going financially and otherwise.  Today my boss was out of town and we weren't going to have the meeting, but I convinced my friend (we'll call him hda) to meet anyway.  Honest and truly I wanted to discuss company business.  But you all know I was hoping for more.  Oh my hda is not a cad.  He's married with kids and while not happily married, committed to it.  The kicker I found out today is that his wife has been reading all the emails I've been sending him for almost a year.  I guess because he was my doctor and I knew from that relationship everything I said was confidential I just assumed that being his friend outside that environment, that would remain the same.  I've told him things that no one knows about me.  Not even my boyfriend of nine years (and right - I'm half in love with hda and have a boyfriend, is that tacky or what....) knows everything that hda knows.  AND HIS WIFE.  He acted like he kept no secrets and she knew his passwords and if she read them, she read them.  I felt like you might if you were in the shower and someone you didn't know ripped back the shower curtain and looked at you naked.    And I said "what about your work email?" and he shrugged and said no password - he just trusted people to respect his privacy.  WHAT? HUH? WHAT?  What color is the sky on the planet he's on?  I just felt like saying "so, you're saying that it is possible your entire office staff knows all about me, my personal life, my feelings for you, etc. etc.???"  I was aghast and I still am.  It is this nugget that has me in a state of shock at the moment.  Perhaps it seems small to you.  I am stunned.  I really don't want an affair with him, but I'm crazy about him.  You know how it is to want something and not want it at the same time.  I often think of that scene in "Pretty Woman" when Julia Roberts' character says "I want it all.  I want the fairy tale."  That's what I want - but a fairy tale doesn't include affairs or divorce or any of those nasty things.  I want what isn't even possible.  I should walk away from it all, but I don't want to.  And the job.  I love the job.  It is the first job I've ever had that I really liked and liked who I worked with and for.  Last night was the board meeting which I really hated.  But I sat at the head table between hda and ceo (we'll call my boss that).  I felt like a big dog. :)  And I drank a strawberry daiquiri to calm my nerves (which sounds like something I might be saying in an AA meeting in 10 years - "it all started when I began drinking to calm my nerves before public speaking and before I knew it, I was out of control....").  It helped.  It reduced me to the level of a normal nervous person instead of my usual freak show event that people pay money to see - flailing, foaming at the mouth, a voice so shrill it breaks glass.  And hda and ceo back me up 100% they don't leave me hanging or allow me to look stupid.  They are really great to work for.  But since I rarely drink I could tell I was feeling a litte tipsy and I needed to pee, but that meant getting up and walking out of the room in front of all of the doctors and I thought if they saw their director of finance weaving a path to the bathroom they might lose confidence in me.  So I stayed put and prayed for a speedy ending.  So the meeting dragged on.  I really think sometimes when I pray I put ideas into God's head.  "Speed it up?  Good one, K - we'll slow it down for kicks - have fun!"  I just wish life would work out in my love life.  Everything else is falling into place.  It has never worked out for me in the pursuit of love.  Perhaps it would tear the very fabric of the space/time contiuum if everything in my life lined up in a wonderful way.  Wouldn't want the guilt of that, would I?  I don't know....watching alot of TV can help you forget about guilt. :)    I have people trying to convince me that there is someone out there for me who is single.  That may be - but it is so much work weeding through the crap.  And the guy I'm dating is not a bad guy.  But I'm reminded of the guy Meg Ryan is engaged to in "Sleepless in Seattle."  Nice guy.  Boring guy.  And he says something like he doesn't want to be someone she settles for.  And that's where I'm at.  I feel I've settled with my current boyfriend.  But he loves me no matter what I look like, we almost never argue - and if we do he lets me win every time.  He's not bossy or controlling.  He works really hard at pleasing me as far as sex goes.  And you know what I mean.  And I wish I was over the top for him - I really do.  No butterflies.  And I could write a grocery list in my head during sex.  He doesn't take me to another place - and maybe it is romantic crap to think he should.  And maybe hda wouldn't either.  Maybe I'm just broken.

      My intent has been to be sufficiently vague in my postings to keep would-be stalkers at bay.  Because clearly my writing will be so clever that it will inspire madness.  In reading other blogs I see that I may lean towards the overly paranoid point of view and perhaps I shouldn't continue to be so vague.  Some points are hard to make when you share few details.  I've recently taken a new job and my writing time has nearly vanished.  I had been at my old job for 7 years and could do it in my sleep - had plenty of time for emails, writing, getting my work done and I had a 6 1/2 hour work day.  Now I work a real work day (of 8 hours) and rarely leave at 5pm and when I get home in the evenings with my girls - it seems to be non-stop until bedtime.  By which time I'm so delirious that my writing is in the toilet.  My mom is visiting, so I'm letting her be grandma and I'm wasting time online.  Mostly trying to keep my mind off the board meeting tomorrow - presenting the financials to the group of doctors I work for.  I'm not a public speaker.  I know most people say that - but I'm so bad, I should be medicated.  When I was in college and at the beginning of a new class they would go around and make you introduce yourself (ok, not every class did this - but it happened)...I would write my name down on a piece of paper so when they got to me I wouldn't forget it.  I'm not kidding.  And when I'm in front of a group speaking my voice raises to a pitch that breaks glass.  I talk too fast, I don't breathe and I think half the audience wonders if they are in the middle of an X-Files moment.  ("Maybe something will burst right out of her head!  That would explain her odd behavior at least....")  I remember once oversleeping for an 8am class where I had to give a speech first thing - I jumped into my clothes and raced out of the dorm to class - where not only was I giving a speech, but they were videoing it for critiquing later.  (not sure of the spelling of critiquing, but just nod and smile)  One of the guys in the class was nearly busting a gut through my whole speech and I was so puzzled by it - nothing humorous in my speech at all.  Later when I saw the video - I saw that I had the most serious bed head hairdo you could possibly imagine (this is late 1980s).  One half was flat, the other super poofy.  I looked ridiculous.    My current method of coping with stress seems to be getting the world's worst headache.  Like I'm wound too tight and might explode.  I'm sure by tomorrow I'll be so bad I'll feel like I might die.  Friday I'll be fine again.  The doctors drink at the meetings and I asked my boss today if it was ok if I partook.  He asked how I acted after drinking and I said "well, I might throw in a dance number with my presentation" and he said "ok, then have two!"  I hope he knew I was kidding.  That's one of the hard things about being new.  When you tend towards sarcasm and humor all the time you think other people get it when you're joking.  When they don't you look like a fool and if you point it out that it was a joke, then they look stupid, so it can be a real lose-lose situation.

      Not sure when I last wrote.  Wish I had more time for writing - M is killing me lately with what comes out of her mouth.  J talks too, but beyond being more articulate that I would expect her to be, she doesn't say outrageous things (yet).    This past weekend I went on a road trip.  I think I'm too old to be making a 1000-mile round trip on a regular weekend.  I was near zombie like state all day Monday.  And as many times in the last 14 years as I have made that trip - I did something coming home I've never done before.  Where to begin...  I decided to stop and let the girls have McDonalds for supper - and let them play in the play area when they finished eating.  J has never made it up inside the habitrail contraption before - but this time it was just her and M and M helped her get all the way to the top.  For awhile she was content to explore the tunnels.  At some point she wearied of that and wanted to get down, but didn't know how.  She began to wail.  I asked M to help her so M grabbed her and tried to drag her down the slide.  This sent J further into a frenzy (imagine that).  I did all I could to calm her down from below - but well...you guessed it.  Eventually I had to climb up inside the habitrail myself - all the way to the top.  The shock of seeing me up there quieted J immediately and M seemed shocked as well (she had just recently asked me why I was "stuck" and when I pried out of her what she meant - she was asking why I had never grown any taller and finally she decided it was because I had gotten too fat to grow anymore...and in looking in a photo album saw a picture of a particularly large person and said "look mommy! there's a fat person just like you! you could be friends with her!" she's such a joy).  Anyway, I got them down unharmed. [As a note to anyone reading this who doesn't know me - and this isn't mean to offend anyone who is particularly large - but I really don't fit that description - I guess except in the eyes of a four year old - who has recently realized calling mommy 'fat' isn't wise and now says things like "you used to be fat, but now you're skinny!" as if I've miraculously lost a significant amount of weight - she is just learning the fine art of saying what people want to hear.  All I will say is I look like a normal mom - not a Cindy Crawford kind of mom - but also not someone whose photo appears on the front of Star magazine with cranes lifting them out of bed.]  I was glad it happened out of town so when my photo hit the front page "freak show at mickey d's" i wouldn't be hounded by autograph seekers.  I can only guess the combination of too much sugar at my mom's and the wild adventure high inside the tower o' fun at mcdonalds contributed to this next problem.  I was ready to pull out of the parking lot back to the road that lead to the interstate.  I couldn't think of which way to go.  A complete mystery.  And I thought "well, the sign from the interstate said to turn left to get to mcdonalds, so i need to figure out which way is left from the interstate...except which way is left? i mean, really it depends on where you are standing, so this doesn't help me at all."  So I finally just took a guess and luckily was headed for the interstate - except when i got there I couldn't for the life of me grasp "north" and "south."  I'm not kidding.  It was like if I was drunk or something.  I saw arrows pointing to Big City and north and I nodded to myself that that was the right way to go and proceeded north.  I was only annoyed because I thought I was through Big City and I hadn't even made it there yet and DEAR GOD was I not ever going to get home?  Then it hit me: I LIVE SOUTH.  I'M DRIVING PELL MELL NORTH.  I'M GOING THE WRONG WAY!  So I'm frantically searching for an exit and am on the phone telling my mom what I did so M is listening and pipes up with "WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE AND WE'RE LOST! WE ARE LOST! WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE!"  She's such a calming influence and great to have around in a moment of crisis.    I have these little mental games I play to keep these sorts of things straight - because they are oh-so-complicated... like if you hold your hands up with the thumbs out, the one that is in the shape of an L is your left hand.  But that didn't help because, like I said, left was all depending on where I was standing.  (my sister laughed uproariously at this comment, I'm still not sure why)  And if it is an East-West issue I think "Go West young man" and remember that the young man was headed to California (I think) so I remember where west is, so the opposite is the East and I have to think "East Coast" briefly so I can think Virginia, Maryland, etc.  (I'm sounding crazy now.  Well.)  And north/south.  Nothing.  And clearly why I got so confused.  ;)  I would write more but inexplicably, I have a headache.  I was fine all day until about 5pm.  One of the doctors in called me - urgently needed me to handle something for him right that second (without boring you with details, i think this guy would easily be suckered in by car dealers and truly believe the deal is "now or never").  He gave me his cell number and told me to call him "anytime."  Oh yeah.  I'm writing that down....  I actually don't think he meant anything by that, but it struck me as a little funny.  My headache started during that time and has never left.  Another thing that doesn't relate to anything, but I'm currently heavily medicated on otc remedies, so I'm babbling.  I guess there is always some part of us that thinks we are sexually appealing to others.  Ok, the pile of guys (hopefully all guys) in that pile for me isn't really that high.  I'm not sure even that it is a pile, maybe just a few guys wandering aimlessly in circles around each other, wearing their Spock costumes.  My real point is that this lady I work with (who I really like, but not "like" you understand...) is 54.  She's attractive FOR HER AGE.   I don't mean that in a mean way, she is attractive.  But I hardly think anyone has a crush on her.  I could be wrong.  But when she deals with some men (not all) she acts slightly girlish and not silly - but... the way you might act if you thought the other person was attractive and you hoped they thought you were attractive and it was just fun, not even flirting.  Does anyone follow this??  I know she is a sexual person, we've already had some candid conversations (no one is surprised I was happy to discuss sex).  I think it is interesting to observe, that's all.  I hope I'm still as interested in sex in 15 years.    Going to bed.    K

      My sister has been on me for awhile to start my own blog.  Mostly I send rambling emails to friends who at least pretend to be slightly entertained with them from time to time.  I often offer up adventures in parenting with little ones m and j.  M is four and j is two.  Last weekend involved me climbing into the habitrail that is the mcdonalds' playground.  Not a pretty picture and glad I was out of town when it happened.    The reason I think tonight is not the best night to start is because I couldn't be in a worse mood.  Yelling, storming about, being rude.  I'm not sure I can blame PMS yet, but I did find myself crying on Friday, so maybe it is possible.  After all these years you'd think I'd have some clue to the pattern of all that - but it surprises me every time.  Sort of like m and j did. ;)  The house is, as always, a mess and I've grown weary of my tired joke "make sure you have your shots up to date before you visit" and I'd rather just have a clean house.  Does anyone else have the experience of living in a nightmare of mess with small children?  They make messes faster than I can clean them up - and God forbid I spend a weekend doing something (my only time to clean) because then cleaning up would involve taking off time from work.  And who has a job like that?  "Sorry, can't come in, need to clean house.  Yeah, that's right.  I feel fine.  Nope, kids are at daycare.  I'm here alone, no company...yes, yes, cleaning house."  They would think I was insane.  Note to self, call in sick when taking off day to clean house.  Of course then there is always the mom figure who makes me feel like a constant failure because she had four children - they all behaved - and the house was always clean - we always ate balanced meals, at the table - and well.  You get the idea.    I will try this again tomorrow and see if I'm in a better humor.

      I think I've been taken out of the loop at work.  My boss has met with hda the last 2 weeks on Wednesday at lunch without me (which means he just left to go see him - why I feel I can blog for a minute).  I don't even know what to say.  Part of me feels like: was I only invited before and told I was "part of the team" because hda had the hots for me and wanted me there?  And now that he's decided it is more prudent to keep his wife happy - I'm not part of the team?  I was never really a management asset, just a cute ass to have at the meeting?  It makes me mad on so many levels I can't even talk about it.    I have been in a terrible mood for nearly a week and it is many things and nothing at the same time.  I can only blame pms for so long and then I just have to admit to either anger management problems or a personality disorder.    My daughter has to have surgery next week - she is four.  She'll be having her tonsils and adenoids removed.  I know it is a routine procedure, but when it is your little four year old being put to sleep it doesn't seem anything but scary.  I know this is one of the reasons I've been in an ill humor.  My boyfriend should be in town tomorrow.  That depresses me.  I'm not sure I even have the energy to break up with him right now.    My mom is still unemployed and I feel like if she doesn't get a job soon my financial house of cards will crumble.  Send some good vibes her way if you could.  My vibes seems to be bouncing off the ceiling.  My friendship with hda made me so happy.  When he would write my spirit was lifted and I felt lighter than air.  I know he's married and all of that wrongness.  I'm just saying how he made me feel.  I guess I kept thinking he would really miss me and decide our friendship wasn't a detriment to his marriage after all - or something.  Something.  But I get nothing.  And my spirit keeps sinking.

      I never know when I'm in a terrible mood if it is all real - or just somehow PMS induced madness.  Mad as in very cranky and also mad as in certifiable...  I think it is made worse because I can't write.  As it is I have about 2 minutes here and I'll have to race to get my girls before the daycare closes...still have to go to the damned store...cook dinner...clean house...and go to bed mad because my fucking computer is broken.    The boyfriend is on his way home and I'm happy for my girls - they've missed their daddy.  But ugh.  I don't even want to talk about it right now.  At least I'll have sex before Friday - and if I can get him to be quiet so I can pretend I'm with someone else, I might be in a better mood....  Talk to you tomorrow...

      I love you, Derek, thanks for the computer advice.  I've done the first part (pebuilder) but haven't taken it home to work on my computer yet.  Thanks so much.  This has been a busy week and I haven't had time to post (besides having trouble even getting to my blog...what's up with that?).  Nothing too eventful, but the board meeting that I love and dread was on Thursday.  Didn't have to present because by the time they got to financials (9pm) my boss decided he would breeze through them in about 2 minutes and move on.  I sat next hda (I didn't plan that) and it was awkward at first, but he drank 4 beers and I had a daiquiri so we both loosened up.  I managed to touch his arm and whisper in his ear too many times - but not so much that I think anyone would have wondered about it.    I think my boss is either reading my blog or my emails or both.  And I had confided in my coworker, Jan, and now I think she is telling my boss what I say.  Isn't it always the way?  But when you are on to people, it can sometimes work to your advantage.  I'd tell you my plan, but if he is reading this, that won't help me, will it?   My boyfriend will be home next week - he is planning on moving in with me.  Deep sigh.  Here I am planning to dump him and he is wanting to move in.  I know my girls would love having daddy around all the time, so I can't (so far) bring myself to tell him it isn't a good idea.  I told Sloth I would not back down from this cliff - I hope I can be true to my word on that.  The board meeting was a complete fiasco, by the by.  It practically turned into a free-for-all and I thought my hda might blow a gasket.  My boss did not intervene - and honestly, his lack of preparedness and organization was the crux of the problem (in my humble opinion).  He took the blame for the failure of it all, but he is good about responsibility taking.  The only problem with that is he tends to take the blame even when it isn't his to take - so I'm not sure now if he truly believes he was at fault, or if he thinks he is doing the 'right' thing by playing along that it is.    Jan the coworker I confided in got on my nerves all week.  I'm not sure if it is age or nutrasweet or the combination, but sometimes she is maddening to be around.   And because she is almost 20 years older than me, she tends to be motherly towards me.  That is annoying on a good day, but this past week made me furious.  I'm not 18 and in need of coaching to handle office politics.  Everyone plays the game their own way and mine has always worked for me.  I've never been fired or left a job on bad terms and I've worked for plenty of assholes that I really hated.  And it isn't because I don't say what I think more than I should - that red hair kicks in and I can be a real pain in the ass.  But I know how to smooth the feathers I ruffle in a way that always fixes the situation.  I don't need Jan coaching me on what to say and what not to say.  She said something last Thursday about how I should quit joking around about not wanting to present the financials at the board meeting.  "Boss will get cranky if you don't let that go."  So what if he does?  Isn't that my problem, not hers?  Am I so clueless on human nature I can't figure out what pisses people off?  She is some kind of fountain of insight?  The way I deal with stress is to either joke around or get rude and cranky.  So I think Jan should shut the fuck up or she'll meet kim, the incredible hulk of rudeness ("you wouldn't like me when I'm angry).  She may meet that kim anyway, eventually.  I try to play nice for at least 6 months.  I think I'm getting too old to pretend to be nice all the damned time.  I've got another doctor emailing me - he is also married - but he isn't saying anything inappropriate...but he seems to find a reason to email me about something every day.  He made a big point to talk to me at the board meeting and emailed me 2 or 3 times the day after.  When I see him I think "Doogie."  He is nice, but I hear he is an ass to work for.  He's not cute so I'm not even tempted.  Not even for a booty call. :)  I'm at my office and need to go - just wanted to let my 3 readers know I haven't abandoned the world of blogging - and when I get back online at home I'll have to debrief and I'll end up writing a novel on here to catch up. :)

      Not being able to get online at home is good and bad.  I feel like I’m out of touch with my new blogging ‘friends’ (can I call you my friends?).  On the other hand, I’m getting lots of things done at home and my girls are watching less tv.  I even braved taking them out to eat at a restaurant by myself last night.  I’ve been wanting a steak and I’m just no good at cooking them.  It really wasn’t too bad – thank God the two year old still fits in the high chair (some of them are hard to get a toddler into) and the belt on it wasn’t broken (more common than I’m happy with)…otherwise she would have climbed out of it 400 times and I would have had to get the order to go like our friend Jay did when he was with his niece.  As it was, I didn’t linger over the meal, but still – was nice to have a good steak dinner.    Tomorrow is the board meeting, so far I don’t have a migraine.  The last two I went to I managed to keep a migraine for the entire week of the board meeting.  Not fun.  I figure stress related.  The meetings are mostly very boring – the first one was interesting – I liked seeing doctors being themselves and facing issues they didn’t have all the answers to – making them seem more human.  Sometimes much more human than I care for.  But now….I eat a nice meal and then listen to endless babble, usually by one or two of the doctors who like to hear themselves talk.  Last time one of the doctors wasn’t there and he had fired someone in a way that brought about a lawsuit, so like the chickenshit he is, he didn’t want to face the board as they heard all the details.  Some of the doctors were very mad that he wasn’t there, others used it as an opportunity to point out all his flaws.  The doctor who was on my case this past week about messing up her financials declared that this doctor (we’ll call him Dick) was emotionally unbalanced and in need of therapy and she ended that with “I know, I’ve been there.”  I think she is still there – not that I disagree with her assessment.  This Dr. Dick is a complete asshole and he stirs up shit all the time.  He is always looking for kickbacks or a way for the rest of the doctors to subsidize his clinic, so he can make more money and work less.  I’m lobbying (undercover) to have the board decide to get rid of him.  My boss wants to keep him because he brings in a lot of money – I think he is a liability and we could find another doctor in his market who would bring in as much or more money.  His clinic is in an expensive part of town…so I often think his numbers are a reflection of the type of patients he sees as opposed to being a great doctor.  What I mean is certain private insurance pays about .70 on the dollar for charges, while other insurance (i.e. Medicaid) pays .50/dollar for charges.  So Dr. Dick could charge $100,000 in a months’ time and reap $70,000 while another doctor could charge $100,000 and only reap $50,000 from it.    Back to my computer.  I never used to have these kinds of problems until I got DSL – I think I didn’t put up the right blocks to keep out the spyware or something.  It seemed completely messed up.  I usually try to fix it by myself – spending days and days on it – but I haven’t bothered this time.  Irksome all the same.  Damn thing is only 2 years old.  I’ve noticed when I’m stressed or PMS’ing (and maybe I’m doing both??) I get exceptionally rude with customer service people.  I let the people at Nextel have it today, earlier in the week it was BellSouth.  It’s almost like I can’t help but say the rudest and meanest things when I’m talking to these yahoos.  Like my mouth is a gun full of ammo and I’m letting the bullets fly.  Part of me feels like they are idiots who deserve my wrath, the other part of me thinks they are just doing their job, and if they are stupid – well, can they help it if they were born with a double-digit IQ?  I canceled my cell phone service today with Nextel (mostly because I get a cell phone from work with 2000 minutes so why pay for my own when I can use the work one at no extra cost to the company?) – and it takes longer to cancel a damn phone then to get one.  On and on about why I was canceling – trying to talk me into staying.  I finally told the girl “look, just put on my account that I’m irrational or whatever you want to do, I don’t care, I just want to get the done quickly, ok?”  Even after all the hassle of disconnecting it she said “well, you have 30 days to change your mind, so if you want to call back and reactivate it, or if there is something I can do right now to convince you to stay, just tell me.”  Oh brother.    I should get back to work…

      I'm such an internet junkie I had to get my sorry ass up and about so I could come by my office and get online.  I don't know what happened to my computer - it was fine all day and then last night it wasn't working and everything I did only made it worse.  Now it locks up and I can't even get anything to open or run.  I thought I would at least save pictures and files before I wiped it and started over (I hate even thinking of doing that).  But I'm not sure that is even possible now.  Dammit.  It was easier to get me to get to the office than it was to WalMart yesterday. My girls are currently raiding everyone's desk for candy.  Oh, they've moved on to using all the tape on my dispenser.  Lovely.  Now the four-year-old has found a date stamp and wants to stamp my hand - the way they do at Chuck E. Cheese (what a nightmare that place is).  I will be forced to get my house all clean since I can't stay online...either that or watch tv.  Nah.  Can't spend Sunday watching TV.  The house is clean except my room and I've been avoiding it since moving in.  One of my friends thought it would motivate me to think of inviting a guy home with me - I'd want my room clean for such an experience, but that is so unrealistic, it doesn't motivate me.  I wouldn't bring home a guy when my kids were there - and they are always there unless I'm at work.  So I'm going to find a guy who not only wants to come home, he's got to be into afternoon delight - and what does that mean?  He doesn't have a job?  Is this the kind of guy I'm attracting?  And really - I'm not that kind of girl.  If it was hda, yes, I would.  And he is a clean freak, so I'd just tell him we'd have to do it on the couch.  ;)  My boss asked me the other day what physical features I looked for in a guy I was interested in.  That is really an awkward question coming from your boss.  I don't want to list any features he doesn't have - but at the same time I don't want to make it sound like he is my ideal fella.  He's 6'4" and I'm barely over 5'.  I didn't want to say "I'm really not into guys over 6'."  When he took me to lunch on Thursday at some point in the conversation he said "we had went."  I wanted to lean over and say: "I can tell you something I DON'T LIKE IN A GUY....REALLY BAD GRAMMAR!" :)  My bf sounds like he parked his tractor outside, so clearly I can overlook this problem.  But since I'm now looking for ideal (hey, why not) I'm not compromising on the grammar.  I don't mean they need to sound like an English manual, but seriously - "we had went"????  A girl has to have her limits.  That lack of Excedrin yesterday has me a little loopy, I think.  I should go back home...  kim

      I was feeling pleased that I managed to add my own links today and when I saw Jay had his picture on his blog, I thought I would do the same.  Well.  All I did was post a life sized version as a post.  I'm an idiot.  And how do I shrink that puppy down?  All I can think is: God, Kim, could you powder your face before you let someone snap photos?!  A smaller version works better.  I'm not sure I'll keep trying today.    kim

      Bad combination of events today.  Out of Excedrin - a daily morning staple in my diet.  I know, taking it daily is frowned on by the medical community.  I could really give a rat's ass.  I don't get rebound headaches from it like I do with sinus crap and the caffeine boost is what I love.  And I was out of any drink that contained caffeine.  How is that even possible?  It may seem like a simple thing to run to the store, but when you have two little kids, it is really not.  Such effort just to run to the store - and how I wish they had drive thru convenience stores.  So many times I'd just like a bottled dr pepper, but that means taking them both out of the car seat, going inside, repeatedly telling them we are not going to buy anything and everything within eyesight and reach.  Putting things back on the shelf, maintaining peripheral view of both of them (that mother scanner on for lurking pedofiles that all strangers might be...)at all times.  Buy the thing, strap them back into the car seats while it is 400 degrees outside - just for one damned bottle of dr pepper.  So I don't bother to go at all.  I went to a drive thru but I usually avoid beverages from fast food places.  My mom rolls her eyes whenever I launch into "such and such gives me a headache" but as someone who's gotten headaches her whole life, I am keenly aware of what my triggers are.  I don't care if you think I'm insane.  There is scientific data to back up my claims - not just anecdotal in nature - but she still rolls her eyes and thinks I'm crazy.  The thing with the drinks at fast food places is the ice.  I'm very sensitive to mold/mildew.  Have you ever seen the inside of one of those things (commercial ice maker)?  Ugh. Shudder.  But today I just took my chances.  Life on the edge here...walking on the wild side. ;)  I suppose an easy solution would be to say "hold the ice."  Damn.  Why did it take me so long to figure that out?  Maybe I am insane.   And then I finally caved and went to Wal-Mart - a horrific place at the best of times - but the ones around here seem populated by circus folk.  When you have a four year old who is fond of pointing out flaws about other people loudly, this can get dangerous.  "Mommy, he has ugly teeth!"  "Mommy, he is missing some teeth!"  "Mommy! She is REALLY FAT!"  Of course, she'll say nice things too "She's pretty!" or "He's cute, don't you think, mommy?"  And then the socially awkward "Mommy, that girl looks like a boy!" If I ignore her she'll only say it louder.  And the two year old doesn't quite have her pronouns and such down - calling "hers" "hims" and the like.  She has created her own share of awkward moments with strangers.  So I had about 40 items on my list - I grabbed the emergency 9 and headed for the checkout because I hate Wal-Mart, hate being there on a Saturday with two cranky kids.  As I'm checking out the cashier says "if you and your girls would like some cake..." and motioned over to the snack bar area "it is free to the public..." and I glanced over as she finished "they had a wedding reception there and lots of leftover food and they are trying to get rid of it."  I smiled and nodded and moved on.  WHAT?  A wedding reception at the Walmart snack bar?  I'm really not a snob and I know everyone can't afford the nicest things - but Walmart?  A public place?   There were seriously NO OTHER ALTERNATIVES?  Or was this your choice?  How much does that set one back to have a reception at a local snack bar.  Hmmm.  And you had a lot of leftover food...is this because of poor planning?  Or none of your friends wanted to be seen there? Or you have no friends - hence the reason for the snack bar option?    must go....  kim

      Ok.  Let’s see.  So many things on my mind, but not sure if I’ll have the time to get it all down, so where do I even start, if at all?  For starters, next week is the board meeting and my goal since starting this job has been to provide the doctors with their individual financials (and g/l detail) at least a week before the board meeting.  Not only because it makes me look good (since the last 2 accountants brought this with them to the board meeting and handed it out then), but that way if something looks askew in their minds we can clear that up BEFORE the meeting and I won’t (hopefully) be put on the spot to explain something in front of the entire board.  It isn’t that I can’t explain their financials – but you know how people are – they expect you to retain every detail of every entry and there are 21 doctors.  And I’m new.  And public speaking terrifies me.  I’m lucky to remain upright at the meeting – when questioned I fear I’ll turn into jello and get that deer in the headlights look of a complete idiot.  Who wants THIS person handling their accounting??  So far I’ve only had one doctor try to ask me inane accounting questions in front of the board – I truly wasn’t listening to him because he had been babbling on for awhile, I had a migraine and he had been talking about something not even remotely accounting related.  Next thing I know he is staring at me with that “what is your final answer?” look and the other board members are looking on, curiously like “what will the new accountant say?” almost leaning forward in anticipation.  I just stared at him as if somehow by staring I could conjure up in my mind what his question might have been.  But my hda saved me by saying “we said not to ask the accountant questions at her first board meeting” and launched into a new topic of discussion as if whatever the question had been didn’t merit answering.  I would have dropped and given him a bj right there for saving me.   ok.  I would have done it regardless.  Dammit, he wasn’t interested.  I think too many years of no sex has made him forget how enjoyable it can be.  Note to self: get dr. hda drunk at next board meeting and have your way with his willy.  Where was I?  Board meeting next week.  My boss has been giving me so many projects that little things LIKE THE MONTHLY FINANCIALS have not been on the critical list.  How insane is that?  So I did get them done but not to the fine tooth comb version I prefer.  Well.  One of the doctors (who is from Pakistan, not that I have any problem with that, but she is very ummm volatile and cannot seem to grasp the simplest accounting details – and for the record, was hospitalized last year for mental problems, so IT ISN’T JUST ME) asked me to email her income statement to her.  I knew she wouldn’t like it, she almost just broke even for the month – and I had told my boss about it and that she had bought an enormous amount of medical supplies.  She called me and the first thing she said was “you have made a lot of mistakes, my financials are all wrong and you need to fix it, this stuff is very important.”  Come to find out what she bought from the medical supply store AND THAT HER OFFICE MANAGER CODED TO MEDICAL SUPPLY EXPENSE was, in fact, some kind of equipment that should have gone to assets.  That’s fine, easy to fix AND HER OFFICE MANAGER’S FAULT.  While I do not have time to analyze every invoice that comes across my desk, I know the longer I’m here things like that will leap out at me and I’ll know to investigate it before assuming the office manager knows what she is doing.  But I’m not there yet.  I just hate taking blame for something I don’t think is my fault, but at the same time I don’t like to be a finger pointer.  I think it is classless to take no responsibility.  There was an opportunity for me to catch the mistake and I didn’t.  I’m trying to convince all of you I’m not an idiot.  Perhaps I need to let it go.  All that to say, she had her panties all wadded and was sort of figuratively up in my face about it.  And I didn’t back down one bit – I refused to let her say I had made a mistake.  Every time she said it I would interrupt and say “it is wrong, I can fix it, but I entered it the way your office manager coded it, I did not make a mistake.”  I felt a little guilty when we got off the phone.  I interrupted, I disagreed and I corrected her.  Hmmmm.  I worried I might get in trouble.  After all, all the doctors are my bosses.  So I emailed the hda and told him what I did.  I talked to my boss on the phone – and you know what he said “are you ok?”  He was more worried I was rattled and would decide I didn’t like this job and quit more than anything else.  Hda thought it was a hoot and said: “Did I ever mention that she is a pain?  Who doesn’t really ‘get it’?”    A little funny to me that they worried I would be rattled by it.  My old bosses rattled my cage on nearly a daily basis.  I would stand my ground with them (to a point) too.  I think people respect you more when you aren’t a pushover.  But doctors don’t like to be disagreed with and I didn’t want them to impulsively decide I was too cantankerous and fire my ass.  My boss later left me a long voice mail with an accent pretending he was the doctor’s husband, giving me a hard time about screwing up his wife’s financials.    So I spent yesterday going over everything with a fine tooth comb – so now I feel like: go ahead, ask me anything, MAKE MY DAY.  My boss called me and J (coworker) into his office on Tuesday to tell us he wasn’t doing very well.  His wife died in February and he (as people do) has ups and downs as he deals with the grief.  His son also is still working through it and that wears on my boss.  He is dealing with depression and let us know he is having trouble sleeping, but then also can’t make himself get out of bed once he is there.  I think all of that is normal.  He just has a high stress job and can’t really take the time he needs to work through it.  He said on Monday he turned off his phone and went to Barnes & Nobles and read all day.  Just checked out.  Thought he might do it the rest of the week.  Didn’t want the doctors to know, didn’t want an anti-depressant.  Just wanted some time.    But for all of that, he’s been here all week.  I think the weekends are hard for him, but when he gets into the swing of work, he puts all the sorrow out of his head.  Putting it on pause, not that it goes away.  Yesterday he called me about 11:45 and asked what I was doing for lunch – and wanted to take me to lunch, but at the last second he told me to invite another lady that works in the office.  I asked if he was afraid to be alone with me and we made a big joke of it.  I really think he wanted to have lunch alone, but chickened out.  Which is goofy, we’ve had lunch alone before.  I think when you decide you like someone things that once seemed like no big deal become a big deal in your mind because your perception or expectation has shifted.  So we had lunch.  He talked on and on and on.  Didn’t even leave the restaurant until 1:30.  I wanted to say “you know you’ll be asking me if I have x,y and z done and I won’t BECAUSE I’VE BEEN AT LUNCH FOR NEARLY 2 HOURS!”  But I didn’t.    I need to get busy now, speaking of that.  Sloth said my blog was peaceful and comfy.  What a wonderful compliment.    As far as handling it all with the mammals, part of it is mentally letting go of things.  Trying to view it from a different perspective.  My parents were strict.  Our house was always clean.  We ate balanced meals, at the table, as a family.  We had chores.  We ate no junk food.  We watched small amounts of tv.  I don’t think there is necessarily anything wrong with that and I can agree with arguments for all of that.  It is just that I’d rather have those things happen peripherally, not for them be the goal.  If that makes sense.  If I make a meal with macaroni and cheese, pork’n’beans and fried hot dogs cut into circles (a favorite meal of my girls – one that would never have graced our table when I was a kid) and we sit on the floor in the living room and watch tv while we eat it – and one girl drops half of every bite onto the carpet and the other one knocks over her drink….it’s ok.  And my girls know it is – my four-year-old will say “it was an accident, we’ll clean it up, it’s ok.”  And we clean it up and move on.  Eventually I’ll dig out carpet cleaner and see if that damned Kool-Aid stain can be removed (for the record: not usually).  I don’t like life walking on eggshells.  I want us to be happy and if that means sometimes things are messy or meals are unbalanced or whatever, then that’s the way it is.  I figure in 15 years when they are gone I can revert to the life I once knew where crayon didn’t decorate the walls.  Work.  I must get to work.  k

      I hate it when my blogging favorites don't update daily (or even more frequently) and here I sit, not writing a damn thing myself.  In part because I'm too busy at work and when I'm at home, I catch up reading the blogs before I think about my own and then there are so many other things to do (little things like dinner, baths, putting the girls to bed, cleaning up, putting the girls to bed, etc.) that I just don't get it done.  Right now I should be cooking - and looking at my two year old she is in desperate need of a hair cut - which probably also means I should trim her nails.  How can I read 137 comments on  urlLink TJ's blog  and still take care of my kids?  How can I hear more about  urlLink Jay's  man thing if I'm cooking dinner?  Will  urlLink Some Guy  resolve his current girlfriendless angst?  Will  urlLink Sloth  take more cool pictures and will her skin really slide off if she gets any hotter? These are things that I must know.

      I sent the following to a group of people I've been friends with a long time - none of them live near me and this past year I emailed them all the time - my way of coping with a depressing situation:  I don’t write many emails anymore.  It isn’t that I’m no longer bursting at the seams to share every thought every moment I have them, but my life doesn’t currently allow much time for soul searching or writing about it – or anything for that matter. [EDITOR'S NOTE: THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT MY BLOGGING]  I got a couple of “where the hell are you?” emails lately and they warmed my heart.  I didn’t reply, but I was so pleased.  Today I’m taking a pause to write because I want all of you to know how important you are and still are to me – even if I’m not babbling to you daily.  I’m using my lunch break – so I’ll be cranky the rest of the day for skipping a meal, but I need to write.   The reason I’m pausing to write today is because I got a scathing email yesterday from T [OLD BOSS, COMPLETE ASSHOLE].  When I left I told them I would help them for a month with accounting issues in exchange for them paying one month of my health insurance – and I would pay the other two months (to cover the 90 days I had to wait to get on my new plan).  They agreed.  Hardly asked me any questions in April – but in May?  Oh dear God.  There was one week T would not leave me alone – they had messed up their books – even modifying entries for the 2 previous years.  It was the biggest mess.  If they had taken it to a CPA it would have taken them weeks to untangle it.  I was able to help him fix it because I’ve been working with their books for seven years – I know the common areas for mistakes and how each thing affects the other.  Step by step we got it until everything was back in balance again.  The first time I talked to him he very nearly sounded on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  The relief at the end was almost tangible.  Yesterday I get an email from him reminding me that I need to pay the May and June premiums for the insurance.  Huh? What?  June is fine, but May?  After all I did for them?  I let him know that I was “surprised and disappointed” in that and why I felt that way and ended it with something like they were having their cake and eating it too.  I knew it would make him mad – but he sent about a 2 page email in reply letting me know what he thought of all of that.  How I had been overpaid all the years I was there because I was an “above average” employee (which is total crap – I am a great employee but that isn’t why they paid me well – they paid me well because they are so hard to work for, the only way to keep a decent employee is for them to pay them more than anyone else – even the CPA told me that was a conscious decision on their part).  The implication from him was that to pay them back for years of overpaying me I should help them for free now.  And went on about how generous they were with me (??) and how even though I didn’t give two weeks notice (what? Huh – I was there 15 days after I gave notice – they went on a fucking vacation – that does not remotely matter to me or anyone with a brain).  Oh god.  It went on and on.  He ended it with something like he hoped I was just having a bad day and if I would let him know I was just having a bad day he might could overlook the comments I made.  Oh brother.  It was condescending and rude and his attempt to put me in my place.  WTF?!  I didn’t reply at all.  I could write a book on how mistreated I was there – but they are dwarves in the stable (C.S. Lewis: The Last Battle).   There is no point in making any defense – they will never believe they acted inappropriately.  I’ll always be the jerky ex-employee.  I can live with that – just hope I don’t need to ever use them as a reference.  (and T may think he won the battle, but he just lost the war – I won’t be helping them with jack shit now and I can guarantee a) they’ll make many more huge messes and b) it will cost them a hellava lot more to have a CPA fix it than the cost of one month of insurance to me)  Anyway – the thing is it really made me think of where I’m at now and how insidious OLD EMPLOYER'S treatment of me was.  I’ve been thinking about it and it is like an abusive relationship – especially verbal or emotional.  People outside looking in say “that is abusive” and you say “no, it really isn’t that bad – they mean well, they just say things in the wrong way” and are insulted that they would think you of all people would allow yourself to be in a situation like that.  I’m reminded of the Shawshank Redemption – you know how Tim Robbins’ character tears away small chunks of his wall every night.  Except in my example – the wall is my spirit.  Everyday someone takes a small chunk of it away and it seems like “well, it is just a little piece, it doesn’t really matter, and I’m ok.”  But nothing ever replaces the missing chunk and more pieces are taken away all the time.  Eventually you aren’t who you once were.  You lack self-confidence, your self-esteem is waning and a feeling of “why bother?” and “who cares?” can wash over you more often than you care to admit.  And I stayed for the money - but looking back - I shouldn't have.  There are more important things than money - personal happiness makes that list.  As you all know I was as low as low could be last year.  Without the comfort and support from my email friends…I don’t know.  I really don’t know where I’d be.  If nothing else, I’d still be there.  Still being treated like something found on the bottom of a shoe.    I love my new job.  It is the best job I’ve ever had and I’ve never been treated better.  I’m amazed daily when people think my opinion is worth listening to.  Not that I believe there is anything wrong with my opinion (because when you are always right about everything all the time – you know your opinion is a good one)…it is just that no one listened to me or even asked what I thought where I was before.  My new boss told me “this is your job, you know how to do it and I won’t meddle with it.”  When I wanted to take off early one day he said “you know better than anyone if you can afford to leave early – and if you feel comfortable leaving, then leave whenever you want.”  The guy I replaced said “yes, they treat you like an adult here” and he said it very matter of factly.  But it isn’t so common.  And it isn’t just being treated like an adult, it is being treated with respect.  I’m included with my boss’s weekly meeting (pow-wow with the president) – and at the board meetings I sit with them.  I feel like a little kid and I want to say “hey! Look at me! I’m sitting with the big dogs!”   I feel like I can barely recognize the person I was last year to who I am right now – and thank god for that.  Sometimes you just have to get out of a bad situation before you can realize how much it was affecting you on a daily basis.  One thing that I noticed recently is that I still feel a little empty.  I’ve got a good job.  My house is clean (this sounds like a little thing, but I was so depressed in BIG CITY my house was always a mess).  I’ve got two girls that I love to pieces.  And I can make friends, but a friend isn’t what I want.  At the end of the day, I still go home alone.  I never have really felt like it mattered that I wasn’t married, but lately it seems like a missing puzzle piece and my life is always incomplete.  BOYFRIEND is still in the picture – still in FAR OFF STATE – but he’s not the one.  And that’s depressing to know I’m going to have to tell him that.  One of the things I think about sometimes is that if you only love someone because they love you – that’s not too hard.  And is it even love?  Mostly I think of that when I think about my mom’s relationships – she seems to easily vacillate between loving and hating.  And maybe inside it isn’t hate – but what comes out seems like hate.  And that is most important – what you show people.  That is what they are dealing with – not whatever mumbo-jumbo is deep in your heart, unknown to all.  She and M have a rough relationship because M doesn’t take any crap and speaks her mind.  My mom is always defensive and more fragile than you’d expect someone her age to be.  I grow weary of all of it and think if you love someone, you love them, even when you might not like them at the moment.  You don't lash out with mean-spirited jabs at their weakest points.  There is nothing about love there.  But last night for some reason I projected that thinking on myself – that it is easy to ‘love’ MY BOYFRIEND because he loves me.  It’s not hard and it is easy and comfortable.  But is it love at all?  If it was would I always feel so empty and unfulfilled and frustrated?  It’s not even a comfortable shoe thing.  You love your comfortable shoes, wear them even when they don’t match and they don’t embarrass you.  I don't know what BOYFRIEND is to me, but comfortable shoe, it ain't.  I clearly should stop and eat lunch.  I must be PMSing.  What's up with all this introspection?  It can’t be healthy.  I’ll say this: I miss you guys.  Love you guys very much.  And I wouldn’t be where I am right now without your support.   K  *************  For the record, part of my introspection today came from having my own words posted on another  urlLink blog .  I chatted with some guy who've I've made friends with through blogger.  I was just talking off the top of my head and he posted some of the things I said in chatting.  I found it ironic that what I was saying made no sense when I thought about my relationship with my boyfriend.

      I think this is a question I’ve been answering for almost 9 years about my boyfriend: why are you with him?   Friends tell me “you talk about him and you never say you love him, have you noticed that?”  There are parts of the story I’d rather not share, but I may in time.    I guess the short version of the story is I had been dumped and was feeling bad about myself.  He came along treating me like I was just the best thing since sliced bread.  Kind of like rebound guy.  He let me know he’d been married twice, had grown kids and didn’t want to get married again or have any more kids.  That was fine with me – he wasn’t the love of my life so thank god he wasn’t interested in all of that with me.  We could just have fun.  I was working two jobs and going to school and had very little time – so the first few years was mostly casual (but lots of sex).  And then I got pregnant (which my doctor had said would take intervention to achieve because of my wacky ovulation so I had never used birth control).  That’s a story in itself.  He was freaked out the entire 9 months – and most of the time was out of town.  It did not change our status.  When my daughter was about 18 months old I finally decided “enough of this shit” and tried to break up with him because I had met someone I really liked who really liked me.  I had sex just one time (with my boyfriend, never slept with the new guy) without a condom and I was pregnant again.  Well.  No one is really too interested in dating someone who is knocked up with someone else’s kid (how did my life turn into a Jerry Springer moment?  I was always such a nice girl.)  So the guy I was interested in was no longer interested in me and here I was pregnant with another baby with my boyfriend, so I figured “what the hell” and gave up trying to break up with him.    I guess what I like about him is that he accepts me the way I am.  He doesn’t ask me to change; he doesn’t criticize me and makes no effort to control me.  Not that he’d have that right, but there are men out there like that (there are women out there like that).  I can be rather needy (or high maintenance) and he pays enough attention to me that I never feel like I’m being ignored or taken for granted.  And now he’s the father of my children.  He’s a great dad (when he’s around).  He helps around the house – cleaning, doing laundry, making the bed, etc.  He’s not a slob.  (I have issues with slobs.)  But he’s not an anal retentive whack job about cleanliness (who wants to be with someone that uptight?!).  He is comfortable and easy.

      I'm amazed at the number of exceptionally good writers out there with blogs.  I've linked to some of my favorites - and will add a few more I found today.  I'm just really inept with all of this - I have to get my sister to add my links.  I added blogrolling and seems like it took a few days to kick in and now I have links and blogrolling and it is a bit stupid, but I just can't bring myself to care too much.  Then I look at all of the great blogs and think I'm either extremely stupid or lazy.  I even downloaded that hello thing for pictures and got nowhere with it.  Can it be that I'm really that stupid?  I just can't think so.  But it seems that a lot of you are a lot smarter than I am.  Well.  I can live with that, too. :)  I don't even think I'm that great of a writer - I think I'm someone who likes to talk who is also a good typist.  So when I have no one to talk to, I just write instead.  So if it seems to be a bunch of meaningless babble - well - it is.  But I love to babble.  And I love this blogging world.    But I sort of did a bad thing this evening.  It's my boyfriend.  He is out of town working and on the weekends he is really bored and he'll want to spend all day on the phone.  I just can't do that - and I mean that any way you want to take it.  I have two little girls and I'm not sure if they are high maintenance or just normal little girls - but I can't just sit and chit chat on the phone.  If I walk around with the phone half the time I'm talking to them and not him (and it is so annoying when you call someone and they aren't paying attention to you).  And when I have a minute to sit down (or clean house, but today I've been avoiding that) I am online.  And I blocked him on my IM because he was annoying the crap out of me.  He is boring and we have the same conversations over and over.  I could have more meaningful conversations with people in line at the grocery store.    Anyway - he called and I was busy and he said "ok, just call me back later, ok?" and saying "I love you" at least a 1/2 a dozen times in one conversation.  Also very normal for him.  I COMPLETELY FORGOT TO CALL HIM BACK.  It finally hit me at 10:30pm that I'd never called him - and when I tried, I got no answer.  I'm sure he's asleep.  Oops.    Here's another thing he does that I don't like - and maybe this is a guy thing.  Phone sex or IM sex.  I just feel like saying "ummm...you know there is porn online...can you just handle that without me, please?"  I'm never alone at home, my girls often crawl in bed with me, so I'm never going to be comfortable with a phone sex conversation.  Not that he hasn't done that enough.  Ugh.  Maybe it would be different if the idea of having sex with him was a big turn on for me.  It isn't.  I can get turned on having sex with him because you know, you push a button, it gets a response.  But on the phone?  IM?  It doesn't happen.  Easier to fake it long distance, but I don't even like having to bother.  And I like sex, it isn't that I don't.  I really do.  But if I'm feeling the need to take care of things - I can manage that much faster if he isn't on my mind.  Sorry.    Don't worry.  He won't find my blog.  He doesn't like to read and cannot make a single sentence without serious spelling and grammatical errors.  It drives me insane.  It is all I can do on IM not to first correct his spelling before answering his question.  That's very rude and petty.  It is just one of my things.  I love someone who can write well.  And I get hung up on spelling.  And it is unfair.  I think that is often something that is much easier for some than others.  But in my defense - spell checker isn't that complicated to use (ok, not on IM but in general).    Here's a reference for the older crowd (myself included in that) and probably more of a girl thing.  Thorn Birds.  I loved that movie (and book).  Damn that Richard Chamberlain for being gay.  Not my point, but he was so hot in that movie.  Rachel Ward's character (Meggie)'s mother wasn't a very warm character - kind of acted like her husband wasn't good enough for her and the life she had not fitting for what she deserved.  I think the dad's name was Paddy.  I sometimes worry I'm that character and my bf is Paddy.    One scene I remember is when goofball Father Ralph is talking to Meggie and her being his rose - and she says something like he's forgotten that roses have sticky, nasty thorns.  I don't know why really, but I think of that scene quite often when I see roses.  I have them growing in my backyard and stepping on a thorn is pretty nasty.  But roses are my favorite flower.  Took me years to get my boyfriend to give me any - and he's NEVER had them sent to me by a florist.  He just buys them at the grocery store and brings them to me.  It's not the same.  But he's improved - the first year or so he'd show up with FAKE FLOWERS.  He went on about how spending money on something so temporary was kind of stupid.  I said "well, how about I cook you a pan of PLASTIC brownies and we'll call it even?"  Who care about temporary?  A blow job is temporary.  What's say we cut that out?!?  I want roses and I don't care if they die in a week and I throw them away.    I should be asleep - gotta get up in 6 hours.  I've clearly hit rambling boring babble and should just stop before I get a blogging demerit for being too damned boring.

      Seems like no one at my favorite blog links has posted anything new - ok...well I did read a few new things, nothing I could post a comment on without seeming even more lame than my other comments...but overall...WHERE THE HELL IS EVERYONE?  And then I thought - well, damn - what have I posted?  So.  Here's a bit of nothingness in my world to share.  I wasn't going to tell you because I hate it when I do the Charlie Brown.  So embarrassing.  That's what I call it when I say too much and act I don't know.  Charlie Brownieish.  I wrote hda yesterday - it was personal, nothing remotely work related.  It went well beyond the realm of acceptable conversation between us.  It would have been pushing it as far as conversation goes even if we were still friends on that level.  I always had a tendency to just say what I thought about his life (when we were friends and emailing daily).  I think in his life, because of his position and his seeming lack of ability to connect with anyone on a deeper personal level, he has no one who just really is extremely honest with him.  I'm not one of those for all out honesty, don't get me wrong.  Honesty can be hurtful - I mean, really.  Do I want someone telling me honestly what they think of how I look or how I act all the time?  No.  I have a couple of good friends who gently point out errors in my thinking - and I think only my mom is so crass as to say things like "you obsess about things, get over it, you're driving me crazy."  My boyfriend is more gentle - he'll say "well, it is how you are, you get something in your head and you have a hard time letting it go."  Same message, nicer - less honest perhaps.  I'm really losing my thread here - my boyfriend is IMing me and my girls think I'm their personal assistant.  I feel like Cinderella - except I have the authority to ignore - and I'm really lacking her ability to take crap gracefully.  What I said to hda was my thoughts on his life, his wife and my perceptions.  I wasn't asking for anything or wanting anything. (except to be right - I love being right) Just some weird need to give my unasked for opinion.  I did say something like "please don't feel compelled to tattle on me or lecture me.  Just read it and delete it.  I'm like a zit ready to pop - and once popped, heals and goes away" (really nice imagery there - comparing myself to a zit...blech)  Later I was embarrassed at myself and wished I hadn't done it.  Then that gets even more weird - do I write and say "sorry about that last email - yes the one I said would be my last - well it wasn't because now I'm apologizing for that one by writing again" that makes me look even more psycho.  So I don't write again and I think it makes it look like I'm ok with having sent the Charlie Brown email.  Damn.  I'm an idiot.    I'm about 80% sure he'll ignore it and we'll never speak of it and life will go on at work just the same as always.  But that 20% worries me.  He'll tell his wife and she'll - what?  I don't know, but I don't want to deal with her.  She's little, but mean.  Or he'll get mad at me for saying what he doesn't want to hear.  I don't know.  All I know is I'm so stupid sometimes.    Right now my 2 year old is standing here talking to me about poop.  It is a riveting conversation.  "I don't like the big poops, mommy."  How do you respond to that?  Thanks for sharing? Do you love the small ones?    I don't discourage them from talking about gross things - I was never allowed - my dad was very proper about things.  If you needed to fart, that should happen only in the bathroom - and discussing what happened in the bathroom?  Very taboo. I remember one time pretending my Barbie had diarrhea and my mom heard me say that - oh...big trouble.  Barbies put away.  It wasn't until I was at college I realized this wasn't how other people were.  I remember a girl coming out of her room heading to the bathroom down the hall saying "I NEED TO TAKE A DUMP!" and she wasn't embarrassed or even trying to be crude.  Just stating the facts.  I loved that.  I may have gone too far with my freedom of expression for my girls, but I prefer it.  I need to be cleaning house.  Damn.  I need a maid.

      It's always a little weird when you think someone is attracted to you but you're not quite sure.  I think "am I reading too much into this?" "do you have the world's biggest ego k, not EVERYONE is in love with you!" and "does he always act this goofy or only around me?"    It's my boss.  I don't know him well enough to know how he is with other people - and he really has real reasons to be in my office all day.  But yesterday - I don't know.  One time when he walked in he came around my desk (and yes, he is so tall that my head is completely at crotch level when I'm sitting) and stood next to me to show me a spreadsheet he had done.  It was simple to follow but he pointed to each thing - almost just reading it to me (I very nearly said "i know it wasn't listed as a job requirement, but I CAN READ.").  When he got done he took the paper away from me and our fingers just brushed each other.  It was nothing and yet, kind of something...sort of a high schooly moment, I suppose.  Normally he just hands me something and sits in one of the chairs in my office and waits for me to comment.  I don't think he's ever walked around my desk before.  It was a slight invasion of my personal space - I didn't care too much - it was just odd to me.  And he has the longest fingers - like a spider.  He could wrap his hand around mine and you wouldn't be able to see mine. it would be completely covered.  I usually prefer guys that aren't so tall - but his hands - I like his hands.  I know he's lonely and he has a six year old he is trying to raise by himself.  And the little boy is still grieving about the loss of his mom.  Kind of sleepless in seattle - this situation.  I've got the boyfriend who is nice, but boring.  I suppose for it to work out I need to move across the country.  Maybe that San Diego plan could work out.    Kidding all the way around.  Not interested, just entertaining myself thinking he likes me.  If I didn't speculate all the time, life would be quite boring for me.

      Damn it's hot.  I hate being hot.  I hate being cold.  I should live in San Diego or something.    Yesterday was like the rest at work - my boss was in my office most of the day.  At one point I let him know I had canceled my daughter's ENT dr appointment because I didn't have time to take her.  He took the hint (kind of) and said "oh, you're busy - I should leave you alone so you can get your work done."  And this is where I made a slight error in judgment.  I said "I don't care if you come in here to talk, BUT YOU ALWAYS GIVE ME ANOTHER PROJECT TO DO EVERY TIME YOU WALK IN HERE!"  And oh my - did he have a field day with that one.  Thank God he decided it was funny - but he went on and on about how he was going to tell hda (boss/president) that K had decided she didn't want to do any work, just wanted a paycheck, etc.  He went on and on.  I let him know that wasn't what I meant - but you know how it is when you try to backpedal out of situation, it sounds so lame.  And it really didn't faze him.  He continued with the projects all day.  I've finally decided it is a compliment - he knows I'll get it done and do it right.  My 'reward' is getting more and more to do. Beats being bored.    Then hda canceled this week's meeting.  I was so pissed and then upset.  I was pissed because I had been killing myself to get several things done for the meeting to present to him.  Could have been working on other things if I had known.  And what's weird - just like last week I was fine most of the day.  Thinking I'm so far over him, I can't even remember who he is.  And then the minute I'm told 'no meeting' I wanted to burst into tears.  I really hate that.  And once again I was surprised at myself.  Dear God - I didn't sleep with the man.  Why is giving up his friendship so hard on me?  Dammit.  So I decided it was best I didn't see him.  I'd prefer to appear to be fine and I'm not sure I could have pulled it off as well as I would have wanted to.  My boss knew I was pissed about the meeting being canceled (although he has no idea about anything between hda and I - not that we had 'anything' but enough (I suppose) that his wife wanted me out of the picture - my boss knows I'm friends with hda and all - but the weirdness and attractions, no clue and I want to keep it that way).  Anyway, my boss knew I was pissed so he said "well, you were shooting for being done at 3:30, so why don't you just leave then?  If you do, I can leave."  I said he hardly needed to arrange his work schedule around me, but he wanted us both to take off early - then he decided everyone should leave at that time and walked around telling everyone to leave at 330.  But then he walked in and out of my office several more times with more projects and then just talking until 330.    So everyone left early and I stayed.  He said "you're making me feel bad" and I swore I'd only stay a few minutes.  I lied.  I stayed until 7pm.  It was my mom's last night in town and she had already arranged to pick up my girls from daycare - so it was really my only opportunity to work late.  I had so much to catch up on - and I probably got 2 days' worth of work done in 3 hours.  Nice to be left alone.  I'm still puzzling over one accounting issue - makes me wish I was still taking my MBA classes - I could discuss it and get lots of opinions on how they would handle it.  I've talked about it with a couple of CPA friends and maybe it is just a situation unique to healthcare or unique to the billing software they are using...but now I'm closing out a third month and still feel uncomfortable with how I'm handling some issues.  I really hate that.  I like to feel like I could get audited at any moment and be able to explain every entry.  In my defense I'm handling it how the previous accountant handled it, but it doesn't make sense but I can't think of how to change it.  I thought I had come up with a solution and made all kinds of entries and when I finished, it was all wrong.  I threw up my hands in disgust (at myself) and decided to call it a night.  Maybe I'll have an accounting  epiphany over the weekend.  Thank God it's a balance sheet problem and not income statement - the doctors only care about the bottom line on their income statement.    What I'm amazed at is how little they understand accounting.  I understand that accounting isn't just something you innately know, but if you look at your financials every month, I think eventually it would start making sense.  They are apples and oranges all over the place.  Their impulsive nature (typical of doctors from what I understand - see a problem: fix it) tends to make them rather vulnerable.  They can be easy to take advantage of financially - a good sales line and they believe everything they hear.  I'm generalizing, but I expected more from them.    And status.  Oh my God are they into status - to the point of personal financial ruin.  I would say a significant portion of them are overwhelmed with debt.  But they keep living the high life to keep up the image.  I don't understand it.  My hda friend is one of those.  He's maxed out his personal line of credit (and I don't know how much that is, but he indicated he ADDED $90,000 to it just last year alone - how is that even possible?).  And I think he takes a vacation about every 6 weeks (or less).  And the doctors all think they work "very hard."  I'm not saying they don't - but most work 4 1/2 days a week - takes lots of vacations - AND ARE VERY WELL COMPENSATED.  And they get perks that other people don't.  Lots of free things.  I just want to say sometimes that a lot of people work hard (and harder) for a whole lot less money.  Some people work two jobs to make ends meet, they see their family very little.  In the scheme of things, I don't think doctors are the most overworked class.  In their defense, it is a lot harder for them to get paid (from insurance companies) than it used to be.  300 hoops to jump through and if your small toe hits one hoop, you have to start over...back to the beginning of the line - and if you take too long, you're out of luck.

      Another frustrating day at work.  I cannot seem to keep my boss out of my office - today he called me on his cell phone and talked to me until he got to the office and then walked in and sat in my office and talked.  This morning he was in there until nearly lunch.  And it isn't just that he talks so much - every time he gives me another project to do.  So the time I have to complete even my normal job is shrinking due to his jabbermouth and then he adds to my workload.  He did ask me today what he was paying me and when I told him he thought it seemed a little low - so I may get a raise soon.  That was a cheering thought - but since I've only worked there 2 months I hardly think the board will approve it.    It isn't abnormal that he is in my office exactly - I give him all the numbers and do the research for the stuff he presents to the doctors depending on what their panties are wadded about on any given day.  It's just that sometimes he doesn't even discuss work - just babbles about anything.    I was standing next to him today, looking at his waist.  Have I told you my line?  What I think of whenever I see an especially tall man? When I was in college a guy I was friends with tried to set me up with one of the guys on the basketball team and I wasn't interested (he was quite stupid) and I said he was too tall.  My friend said "yeah, but you wouldn't have to bend down as far."  So everytime I see a tall guy that phrase runs through my head - and I often think of it when my boss walks in.  Anyway, I think my head would nearly rest on his belly button.    I talked to J at length about my lost friendship with hda.  Like all my friends, her advice was to walk away and let it go - nothing else I can do.  And nothing else I would do - it just isn't what I want to do.  I'll have to see him tomorrow at my weekly meeting - if I choose to go.  I'm not sure I'll be given a choice - my boss is a little unpredictable about it.  One minute it is an 'of course' the next minute optional.  My mom wondered why I would go if it would make me uncomfortable - and I guess that makes life more interesting to me.  If I skip it for fear it will be uncomfortable - that is boring.  Even if my feelings are hurt - it is a feeling.  Boring is nothing.    I guess that's why it has been a fun year in regards to that - his emails made me feel silly and happy and like all was right with the world - kristina and the waves.  That rollercoaster of emotions that crushes bring on.  It was fun - I hadn't felt like that in a very long time.  I've been with my boyfriend for 9 years and I've never felt like that about him.  But he loves me.  He thinks the sun rises and sets on my head - and that is worth a lot.  Sometimes I think I should marry him and give up my movie-induced happily-ever-after idea.  Not today.  I'm not giving up just yet.

      When I read other blogs or comments in other blogs there is a familiar refrain among the better writers - they find themselves blogging all the time, thinking about blogging and about how the outlet is good for them.  A form of therapy, etc.  I've had people tell me for a couple of years I should write a book - but I've never felt I had what it takes to do that.  Unless free spirited babbling = great book - and I've never noticed something like that on the bestsellers' list.  So I've been content to write group emails to my friends - but this is so much better.  Less personal, but more freeing.  I mean - when you write to people you know you have to remember their issues and avoid certain topics or at least water down some stories so as not to offend, etc.  Watch the language when you include Aunt Judy in the list, and so on.    A couple of weeks after I started my new job (in the city I refer to as "home" even though I'm not from here or anywhere, to be quite truthful) it was secretary's day.  My boss took me, his secretary and J (director of billing) out for lunch and bought us flowers.  Not being remotely a secretary, I was pleased and annoyed at the same time.  (After I heard the story about the secretary propositioning the boss, I understood why he didn't want to take her to lunch all by himself, and I got a great meal and flowers out of the deal, so no complaints all in all.)  Anyway, at that lunch they were talking about cussing - and being new, I tried to just feel them out before speaking.  The secretary is one of those people who probably has overdosed on nutrasweet or did drugs in college - who knows really what the deal is there, but some neurotransmitters are out of commission in her brain.  A few of my sarcastic comments were greeted with horror by her and it wasn't worth fixing so I looked nearly insane, but that keeps people guessing, so not all bad.  Anyway.  Cussing.  They all talked about how their use of language altered after having kids.  I found the same, except the reverse.  (Sort of Captain Kirk in the Voyage Home movie - I'd tell you I can quote dialogue, but don't want you to really know that about me just yet.)  Meaning I cuss MORE now that I have kids.  What's up with that?  :)  I don't know except that both of my girls have had to be put in time out at school for their colorful outbursts from time to time (damn and shit are favorites).  I try to save fuck for situations that are really over the top (and I do try to avoid using that one in front of my girls).  But it is a great word - noun, adjective, direct object, verb, etc.  And I don't look like someone who would ever say it, so it is that much more effective.  Of course.  Well.  When I was pregnant with my four year old I got mad at the customer service people at Lowe's and used that word repeatedly...so much so that I've been afraid to return for fear they have my name and picture on a bulletin board as "worst customer ever" or something.  Truly, I've never been back.  I'm not one for home improvement anyway.  My mom and boyfriend usually handle those things - not that I'm too girly-girl to get my hands dirty...I just lack patience. I'd rather buy something put together or pay someone to do it.  I wallpapered my bathroom one time - and it turned out fine - but usually my projects frustrate me and I throw it all in the trash and call someone to fix it.    I'm not sure why I enjoy cussing so much, but maybe it is just because I can.  Growing up my parents were very strict about language - there was practically nothing 'bad' I could say - even words such as crap, darn, golly, jeez and shucks were forbidden (because, according to my dad, "golly" is slang for God and that is taking the Lord's name in vain - same for "jeez" = Jesus; darn = damn; and shucks rhymed with the dreaded f-word so it was really bad).  Not that I think it is particularly charming to cuss like a sailor - I do try to keep my language matching the audience most of the time.  I did say 'fuck' the other day at work accidentally.  I think they are figuring out I'm not the quiet shy girl they thought I was.  If my hda hadn't vouched so strongly for me, I'm not sure I would have gotten the job because I come across as shy and perhaps a push-over.  I don't think you have to appear to be aggressive to actually be aggressive.  In some ways it is easier to get your way if people are caught off guard by you.  I think they mostly thought I'd cave if one of the doctors got pissed off at me about something.  I'm of the mindset that people are people and just because they are doctors doesn't make them better or smarter than me and I can hold my own.  My boss said the other day (to someone else about me in front of me) "K seems nice, but if you make her mad, she's likely to run over you in the parking lot.  So I wouldn't make her mad and if I did, I'd stay out of the parking lot."  I took it as a compliment - I felt like he was saying I'd run them over if they got in my way or made me mad, but obviously not literally, just figuratively.  My mom said (when I told her) "sounds like he's got you pegged."    I used to be horribly shy and still (as I've mentioned before)I do get berserk about public speaking.  But now that I know that drinking helps that...I'm good to go. :)  I think having children helps.  That mama bear mentality - fight you to the death to save my girls.  I can't explain it, but since they were born I'm a much stronger person.  I never felt weak, but now I feel like I can handle whatever it is - bring it on. :)  Hit me with your best shot.  Going to bed.  Thanks for letting me babble.  K

      It really makes me feel missed when I get emails every day saying, “Where are you? Still in X? Still at your mom’s?”  I’ve worried I was sending too many updates and everyone was weary of them thinking “Geez, K, we don’t need a minute by minute report of your LIFE for crying out loud!”  But my sister pointed out that even my emails that say, “I’m ok” don’t sound ok and that I actually sound depressed.  Didn’t mean to worry anyone.    I went to L and stayed with B (sister) and her husband and son over the weekend.  The girls loved it – there was no stress about noise or mess (like at my mom’s).  I finally quit having chest pains, so that was nice. ;)  L is very pretty – lots of horse farms, just like you might imagine Ky to look like.  We didn’t do anything exciting – a trip to Wal-Mart and playing at a park with the kids.    When we were at Wal-Mart I was there mostly as an observer while my sister shopped.  So you know how you do – you watch other shoppers.   I was standing in frozen foods with J in the basket, watching people walk by.  A black lady (this was around the time people would be getting out of church) in a white dress walked by, so I was looking at her – she was attractive, but I was thinking she could have used a slip because I could see her panties – and as she walked by there was a man behind her, I think he was with her.  He was watching me watch her.  He smiled at me, nodded and winked. I halfheartedly nodded, not sure what I was indicating by that.  So now I’m thinking – OH DEAR GOD I’m staring at this woman’s ASS and this guy is giving me a LOOK.  Does he think I’m gay?  Have I just agreed to a threesome with this nod?  B, LET’S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!  I actually didn’t tell B about it, but I did steer us out of the frozen food department.    Let’s see.  You want an update.  I guess I haven’t given one because I wanted to wait until things were settled.  I’ve put out feelers in A trying to find a job so I can go home.  So far I’ve come up with nothing.  I have one other possibility in F – I’m just not that interested in living there.  I’ve decided to let this be my last week in limbo, so if I don’t have a solid offer by Thursday, I’ll sign a lease on an apartment and get daycare lined up.  The ironic thing is I’ve already been here a month, so if I had gotten a place right away I could already be on a 5 month count-down to move away!  I’m still at my mom’s and it is horrible.  My mom is watching the girls still and poor M is miserable.  “Grandma is mean to me.”  And so she is.  Being three years old means she doesn’t know when it is best to keep quiet – so she frequently says, “Grandma, I don’t like you.  You are mean to me.”  Which only makes it worse.    Seeing all the horses in Ky reminded me of when I took horseback riding lessons in college.  I had visions of galloping like a pro, wind whipping my hair.  Little did I know that they intended to teach us to ride on English saddles.  Have you ever seen one of those up close?  Pretty much it is a slick piece of leather tied around the horses’ middle.  Nothing to hold onto.  Oh, yeah…stirrups.  Like I could seriously hold myself on a horse with the bottom of my feet.  I was in trouble from the first day.  They decided to let us all practice getting on the horse.  This was in 1987 so naturally I was wearing jeans that were way too tight.  Like so tight lifting my leg was nearly impossible.  So I made a small effort and someone pushed me from behind and I ENDED UP FACING THE WRONG DIRECTION.  I’m not joking.  Perhaps a career as a clown for Ringling Brothers should have been my career aspirations.  At any rate, they got me down and we tried again.  This time I was facing the right way.  But it seemed to me that I was WAY UP IN THE AIR.  I’m sure the horse wasn’t that big, but when you are only 5 feet from the ground all the time, sitting on a horse seems like quite a drop.  So I crunched down and the horse started running.  Seriously – he got away from whatever idiot was supposed to be holding his reins and took off around the stable thing (see, I really have the horse lingo down).  I felt like we were practicing for the Derby.  I was terrified.  I held onto his mane and wished that I had managed to have sex at least one time before I died.  Way off in the background I could hear people shouting, “Sit up! Sit up!”  Huh?  Sit up?  The horse is racing around and I’m supposed to sit up?  So I can bounce of the backend of this thing?  I finally sat up a little bit and the damned horse finally slowed down enough for someone to get his reins and get him stopped.  They told me I had “like a natural” sat like a jockey and the horse interpreted that as a signal to GO.  They all thought it was hilarious and I somehow weakly chuckled like I was also highly amused.  The worst thing was the instructor took mistook my incompetence as ‘great with horses’ and gave me a horse that was a little bit hard to handle.  When I came the next time (oh – well, we got to watch someone clean a horse and saddle it – and I was at the back end and the horse lifted his tail high in the air and farted as loud as you please.  I wanted to laugh and point like a junior high student but everyone else acted like they didn’t notice.  I missed most of the lesson because I kept thinking, “the horse farted.  I saw the horse fart.  Did everyone miss that but me?”)  I was wearing sweat pants.  I thought this would make getting on the horse (I think mount is the right word, but I’m not entirely comfortable saying I mounted a horse...) much easier.  And, it was, actually.  The horse I was given had some sort of problem that made its gait off.  Like syncopated or epileptic…all I know is it wasn’t right.  We were supposed to be bouncing in rhythm on the horse (ALL THE WHILE HOLDING ON WITH OUR KNEES…I ASK YOU…KNEES???).  My horse and I were never in sync and I’m bouncing and he’s bouncing and it was awful…and then my foot slipped out of the stirrup.  Truth of the matter is the stirrups actually do help keep one on a horse.  And when a certain someone is wearing sweatpants on a retarded horse with epilepsy and their foot falls out of the stirrup THEY FALL OFF THE HORSE.  It was a slow motion moment – I could tell I was falling and I couldn’t stop it.  Wham…down to the ground.  The instructor insisted I get right back on, which is I guess what you do.  I was too much in shock to disagree.  I can’t remember much else about that lesson, but I do remember I couldn’t move the next day.  I hated horses after that and managed to finagle out of getting back on it every lesson except one after that.  I made a B in the class, I’m not sure how or why, but maybe it was a sympathy grade for my tumble.  There are a lot of horses here in X as well.  The people I work for are all family and they bought 70 acres south of X – I have to drive 25 minutes out in the country to get to (what I call) their compound.  They’ve each built a house on their acres.  There is a lake in the middle and the houses are spread out around it in a circle.  The office is made to look like a barn from the outside, but looks like regular offices when you get inside.  Since my idea of enjoying the great outdoors is driving with the window down in my car, you can understand I’m not totally keen on the setup.  It takes me 5 minutes of driving from the office to get to a real road.  Most of my cds are in a box in storage, so there are only 4 in my car.  M only likes 3 songs on 2 of the cds, so we listen to them over and over and over.  She would make a great musician because she likes the repetition.  Some of the songs have notes held for a long time and she’ll want me to play that section over and over.  Reminds me of band practice or choir practice.  One of them is John Denver’s greatest hits and the other is B.J. Thomas’ greatest hits (yes, we’ve been over the B.J. Thomas thing).  Don’t make fun of my music. On B.J. Thomas’ M likes the “Rain Song” (Raindrops Keep Fallin On My Head) and the “Feeling Song” (Hooked on a Feeling).  On the John Denver cd she likes the “Country Boy Song” (Thank God I’m a Country Boy).  We’ve listened to that one about 400 times. (and we always listen to it really loud – M says, “Louder Mommy! Louder! I said louder!!”) I’ve finally gotten it memorized (which isn’t easy).  This morning I was listening to one M doesn’t like – I’m not sure of the title, but it goes “You fill up my senses, like a night in the forest.  Like the mountains in springtime, like a walk in the rain. Like a storm in the desert, like a sleepy blue ocean. … Let me lay down beside you. Let me always be with you.  You fill up my senses, come fill me again…”  Like a night in the forest?  I’m not joking, I don’t get that one.  I get visions of bugs attacking, which isn’t all that romantic.  I saw a “Behind the Music” thing on John Denver (actually it was on CMT, not VH1, so I don’t know what they called it, but you know what I mean).  He was talking about having cheated on his wife a zillion times – sleeping with hot chicks at every concert. (He wasn’t proud of himself, so I’m not totally knocking him.) They eventually divorced and he married some hottie from Australia who divorced him a couple of years later and took most of his money.  When I’m listening to him sing romantic songs all I can think is he should have gotten his head out of his ass.  Don’t get me wrong, I like the songs – but if someone was singing them to me I would roll my eyes and think he is either stalker material or so far out of touch with reality I don’t want to be with him.  Can’t we have a song that says, “I’ll keep the pantry full.  I’ll vacuum every day.  I’ll read to the kids and give you some quiet time.”  Now THAT is romantic.   Ok, I’m babbling now.  They all left me alone in the office and right now writing is my only outlet.  I’ll send another email next week letting you know what I decide to do.  I’ll keep it brief. Guess I’d better get back to my accounting so I can earn my paycheck for the week.  K

      I think I just need to lock the door to my office so I can get my work done.  Lately everyone who walks in there turns into a chatty cathy doll.  And there was a meeting this afternoon that I had no intention of attending and my boss came in about 3 minutes after it was supposed to have started and said "we need you to be a part of this meeting."  I said "I'm really busy" and he said "you'll enjoy it, come on."  And I said "are you telling me I have to go?" and he said he was.  Dammit.  So 2 hours of my day wasted listening to people talk about things not remotely related to my job.  Jabber jabber jabber.    I'm going to try to come up with something more entertaining to post this evening - I may dip into my email archives.    On a personal note, haven't cried for a few days about hda.  Making progress I'd say - or too busy to think about it. Either way, whatever works.

      I didn't post yesterday because of a migraine.  I'm not one for aches and pains in general - but I do get a lot of headaches.  Always have.  Sometimes I write when I have a headache and that writing always seems funnier to people...I guess because I'm even less lucid than normal. :)  I shouldn't be blogging right now.  I'm at work and am behind.  I'm typically not behind on my work, but in an effort to impress, I've been volunteering for many projects.  Just have to get a handle on it all now.  So instead I'm ignoring the pile and talking to you.    I spent most of yesterday with my boss - across town at one of the clinics meeting with one of the doctor's wives - she wants a job and was trying to convince us what she could do for the company.  She was in her 40s, very very tanned - to the point of nearly leathery, blond hair (dark roots), and very thin but big boobs.  I commented to my boss about it after we left and he swore he never noticed. Humphf.  Now he's decided I've got a fixation on boobs.  I really don't, but when they are so extreme as to not match the other figure features AND the person is wearing a tiny, tight - horizontally lined - shirt...you notice.  My boss is 6'4" so maybe he wasn't at the best angle to notice.  I'm barely over five feet, so those suckers were staring me in the face.  She's only been the doctor's wife for a few months and that is what bothered me the most.  I don't care in general if a wife is in the admin office, we don't have any secrets here.  But if in 6 months they decide they aren't meant for each other and she decides to divorce him and take him for all he's worth...do we really want to have invested a lot in her as an employee?  I think that is unwise.  Awkward not to hire her in some respects as she is well qualified for the job in question.  I think they should low-ball a salary offer so she is the one who turns us down.    After that meeting he bought me lunch - and then spent an hour in my office when we got back to work.  All of that is why I'm behind!  I think my boss is mildly attracted to me.  My friend keeps telling me that based on what I've told her and I thought she was reading too much into it.  But putting two conversations we've had recently together, I figured out that I'm the kind of person he is attracted to.  Even if he is, he won't ask me out.  He's too aware of what is appropriate and inappropriate in the workplace setting to ever compromise himself.  So it has the effect of making our friendship have no pressure on it.  My mom said "you can always get another job and he's SINGLE!"  Mothers.  His secretary told him last year that if he wanted to spend the night at her house, he was welcome to. (can you imagine?  like I told J (coworker) - you ALWAYS leave yourself an out to save face so you can backpeddle and act like they misunderstood - even if you both know he didn't) So yesterday I told him "you know, you can spend the night with me anytime, you're always welcome."  And I burst out laughing.  I did it in front of J so there would be no doubt I was joking.  I told him I had planned to do it when I was alone with him in his office - but decided not to do that to him (since that episode with the secretary he is a little paranoid).  Then I said "then I thought you might realize right away I was kidding and try to get me back by accepting my offer 'how about tonight?' and I'd hyperventilate."  Then I laughed even more.  So.  Probably laughing so much at the idea of us sleeping together didn't inspire him to think I'm interested.    I'm really not interested.  But he's a nice guy.  I'm trying to set him up with a friend of mine.    I should get busy!  k

      I can't believe it, I think I left B.J. Thomas off my list of favorite music - how could I do that?!  My California friend Judy let me know last year that my love of B.J. Thomas was scaring her.  So I try not to speak of it often or loudly.  It's just that I was in love with him when I was 7 years old - he was tall (to me), skinny, good looking and long hair just like Jesus.  He sang songs I loved and I wanted to marry him.  So I guess my lingering feelings 30 years later are mostly just a reflection of enjoying it when I was a kid.  My girls and I have a CD of his "golden classics" and we sing to them quite often...now they ask for the "rain song, mommy, rain song!"  We have a bunch of songs we sing together - it would seem I'm turning them into little nerd girls.  All the other kids will know Britney (or whoever) and my girls will be singing Raindrops Keep Fallin' on my Head....the two year old is mostly good at hitting every last word in each phrase.  It's hilarious to listen to.    One of my favorites is "Hooked on a Feeling" - but the lyrics kill me.  I suppose to the vernacular of the time this was less tacky:   All the good love, When we're all alone, Keep it up, girl, Yeah you turn me on.  Keep it up, girl??? Keep it up??? Dear God, BJ - WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?  I guess his name says it all. ;)  My all time favorite song as far as what I'd like to hear while having sex (instead of "are you there yet?") is "Slow Dancin' Swayin' to the Music."  I don't know what it is about that song, but I can close my eyes, pretend I'm dancing.  And well.  Let's just say a little mini pad might be needed.  How's that for tacky.  But speaking of what I actually do hear during sex.  What is it with asking if I'm "there" yet?  If you can't tell, don't ask.  And if you have to ask...it is like shopping at an expensive store.  If you have to ask, you can't afford it?  Well, if during sex you have to ask if your partner came, she didn't.  I've tried being honest - thinking hearing "no" would clue him in not to ask anymore.  Oh no.  Then he is on a mission to remedy the situation.  Oh brother.  It is kind of one of those things where once it's gone, it's gone.  There's no going back to retrieve it. Let it go!  I enjoy the whole thing of sex - the kissing and exploring and intimacy.  Orgasm is not my goal, but nice if it happens.  But my boyfriend thinks it's the goal.  So yes, I fake it.  But not to be mean - or deceitful.  Part of it is the area down there - look, it's not leather.  It's sensitive.  You keep rubbing it and what was once a feeling of pleasure is now pain.  Or just plain irritating.  And if you're taking notes - irritating is not a build-up to a great climax.  Unless that climax is her screaming at you to stop.  Get off me, you big oaf.  I never have one during regular sex - and I guess that isn't uncommon, but that would be so great.  Anyway, he goes down there and figures it out with his tongue which is good.  What's bad is razor burn.  Either grow a beard or use the best razor you have.  Razor burn - not so much fun.  I'm more calm today - emotionally.  Being back at work was a good thing - I feel more in control there.  My boss spent most of his day in my office (what's up with that?) so I couldn't blog from there.  Not that I don't have plenty to do, but I like checking in here.  Tomorrow I have to go across town with him to a meeting, he decided this afternoon he wanted me tagging along.  I love that.    One thing my boss said today - I don't know.  He knows hda and I are friends.  One of the doctors (not my friend) asked my boss (we're calling him David, aren't we?) to do something a little less than kosher - and wanted David to let it slide.  David knows if money is involved (it was) that means I'll know all about it.  So that means colluding with me to scam the other doctors.  And he knows that's not going to happen.  Not that David would, I don't think, but my presence makes it not even remotely possible.  I wonder if he resents that.  He said "yeah, I'll hand you a check and tell you to code it like this and ask no questions and then hda will ask you what it is AND YOU'LL TELL HIM."  I just smiled when he said it - what could I say?  I would tell hda.  Which sort of makes me a mole - but at least everyone knows I'm the mole.  I don't know what to think about it - I don't like being thought of as the tattletale - but since hda got me the job and we've been friends for 10 years - I have loyalty to him.  How can I not tell him if something is squirrelly in his own company?    I can't remember where I left it when I mentioned it last, but I've decided to keep going to the weekly meetings.  It's now considered part of my job and not going seems childish or something.  Like if we can't play the game the way I want, I'm not going to play at all.  And this is my job, I need to do it the best I can.  So I'll fake it 'til I make it - meaning I'll act like I'm fine and eventually I will be fine.  Every day will get easier.    kim

      A person could spend all day reading other peoples blogs.  What is so strange to me is I didn't know this online world existed until a month ago or so.  I'm trying to keep myself here, blogging when I need to vent.  Had I discovered this this time last year, my life would be completely different now, I think.  I'm happy with where I'm at (no offense) but I'm glad to have found you now.    I told you I told J about my hda situation.  One thing she said after listening to my abridged version was that if hda's goal was to save his marriage, offering me a job and bringing me back to this state was very counter-productive.  I'm fairly good at being inconsistent, so I can't really fault him for that.  He once told me he was so uptight (about sex) that the only way he could make a move was if he had been drinking.  At the first board meeting I went to he drank 5 beers.  (yeah, psycho me kept count - but I'm the accountant, it's what I do)  I'm not much of a drinker so I asked my drinking friends "is this excessive?"  All agreed that it was.  But did he make a move?  No.  Didn't even hint at it.  So it is like part of him wants to but something inside him keeps him from doing it.  And if he was waiting for me to push him in a dark corner, untie that string that keeps up his scrubs (ok, given that more thought that necessary) and take him down and do him.  Well.  That would never happen.  I'm happy to be aggressive sexually once the relationship is established.  And if he was single and not my boss - I might even do the normal hinting type of things.  I just couldn't.  And now I'm glad I didn't.  How humiliating would that have been?   I've talked to my boyfriend about the fact that hda and I aren't friends anymore.  But he isn't stupid - he knows there is more to the story than I've told him.  Now he is talking about making our relationship more permanent.  Deep sigh.  Dammit.  I told him we'd take it one day at a time.    I say hda is my boss - but only in the grand scheme of things.  He is the president, but I don't really report to him and his office is across town from mine.  My real boss (ceo) is D.  And he is the best boss I've ever had.  It doesn't hurt that he isn't hard to look at - but that really doesn't matter.  My first 'real' boss out of college was extremely good looking.  A complete asshole, however.  I think he did coke in his office.  He was a bizarre man.  Drove a red corvette and I thought it was cool for a little while - until the first time I saw him go berserk and scream and humilate another employee.  I don't care what you look like, what you drive - when you're a jerk, you're a jerk (even if your name isn't Mike).    Hda has commented frequently on the fact that you often see beautiful women with ugly men.  I think in part it is because looks aren't usually the primary goal for women.  I told him money had a lot to do with how attractive a guy would seem to some women.  He found that hard to believe.  I guess when you alone (not counting the MD wife salary) are bringing in over a 1/4 a million a year, money doesn't seem like an issue.  It is an issue.  It's not for me - but it is for many people.  I'm not saying I don't have money issues - I'm saying I wouldn't pursue someone because they had money.  I make enough to take care of me and my girls and I don't need someone to help me make it.  But I know many women who've been in a bad situation who found someone who would take care of them.  But they pay a price sometimes.  Not that all rich men are cads.  Hell.  Plenty of poor guys are cads as well.  I'm down this road in this conversation that I didn't intend on or even care to be on.  Where's the damn off ramp?  I intended to talk about my boss (ceo).  Let's call him David.  His wife killed herself in February.  The weekend hda emailed me and told me their current accountant had turned in his notice (Friday) that Saturday David's wife killed herself.  So on Sunday hda emailed and all he said was she died.  I didn't find out it was suicide for at least a month - I think after I had told them I'd take the job.  I was really annoyed that hda didn't share that without me asking outright - this guy is going to be my boss and his wife just killed herself?  Don't you think this is NEED TO KNOW information?  Why did she do it? Because he was such a jerk?  I didn't know anything until after I started.  He eventually told me the whole story - it wasn't her first attempt - she was severely depressed for five years, been to many different psychologists, etc.  On medication.  How he felt, how their son was doing - he poured out his thoughts to me (and that undergrad in psych finally going to some use...).  He's remarkably self-aware and resiliant.  Whatever doubts I had about him vanished quickly.  What I love is that he doesn't micromanage me.  He said "this is your job, you know what to do, I'll leave you alone."  And he does.  He comes in my office from time to time to get reports or ask questions or surprise me with meetings - but nothing different than any other boss would.  And my office.  It is so great.  Mine is the only one with a window - and I'm around the corner and down the hall from everyone else.  That sounds like a bad thing - but it means I get my work done without listening to a bunch of crap going on outside my door.  I come and go as I please and as long as my work is done, no one cares when I get to work or when I leave.  I love it. :)  I spent the last 7 years in Dilbert hell, so this is all like heaven to me.  Time to color my hair.  L'Oreal 9RB for anyone who's taking notes.  It is the color my hair has always been, but the older I get, the more little gray hairs show up in it.  It can almost seem like I got highlights put in.  Which may be 'in' but I'm not going to be one of those people who is happy to be all gray headed.  (or is it grey headed?)  So I keep it colored.  I used to think coloring your hair was cheating, but since I do it now, it is totally cool. :)

      Lately I've been having my version of sex dreams.  Nothing too erotic or lurid - but it makes me think it has been too long since I got any.  The boyfriend will be home in two weeks.  He doesn't give me butterflies, but he manages (most of the time) to take care of things.  Anyway - last night in my dream I just started kissing this guy I didn't even know - he acted like he wasn't interested in me, but he got a woody all the same.    A week or two ago I had one about my hda (which is so rare - I almost never dream about someone I know).  We were laying on a couch - he had his back to the arm of it and I was laying in between his legs with my head on his stomach.  Nothing sexual, just comfortably watching TV.  I guess I decided to get frisky, so I wiggled down and alternated putting the crystal balls in my mouth - and was going to proceed to leave a lipstick ring (something I read today - never heard that one before, but I liked it quite a bit).  But he got annoyed with me and told me to put the toys away.  I'm not fond of being told no, so I put the package back and left angrily.    (In relaying this dream to my boyfriend I told him he was the man in the dream...no need to get picky with details.)    Oral sex is an interesting topic - I'm amazed at the people who don't do it.  I can see the argument why men wouldn't want to do it as the idea of that to me is nasty (but enjoyed tremendously, so THANK YOU), but doing a guy isn't nasty at all.  I mean - it is just skin - as long as they are clean, why is it a problem?  And it is so entertaining to watch it grow.  Knowing just the right spots to mess with to get a reaction.  And it makes him so happy - how can you not take care of that for someone you love?  And so much less messy than sex - assuming you swallow, of course.  My theory is it is like snot - you wouldn't drink a glass of it but if it slides down the back of your throat, you won't die.  And if you make sure it is far enough back in your mouth (past the tongue) when it gets to that point, you don't even taste it.  No biggie.  Well.  It is big, but you know.  Well.  He'll be home in two weeks and maybe the topic won't be at the top of my mind all the time.  I know - I said I was going to break up with him, but I gotta get some first, right?  Might be awhile.  Like a squirrel, got to store up.

      I finally cried last night - just buried my head in my pillow and let it all go.  The thing about being fair complected (how does one even spell that?) is that when you cry, you get splotchy.  And for me - it means my eyes will be swollen the next day and people might think: bee sting? both eyes?? So. Thank God it's Sunday. If I was a better mom we'd be getting ready for church.  I grew up going.  They go to a Christian daycare so it isn't like it is "Jesus who?" but still.  Church is something I always enjoyed growing up.  It's awkward now though.  Yes, I've got 2 girls, 2 and 4.  No, I'm not divorced.  Not married.  Never married. Not gay.  Ok...so...um....why?  And I don't feel like answering that.  You think people might wonder this to themselves and wouldn't really ever ask.  But they do.  Eventually, they do.  I'm not a secretive person, but sometimes I just don't feel like sharing everything with people at church.    So we're home.  Everyone was sleeping until a few moments ago.    And today I'm feeling better.  Last night I was trying to think of what direction I want my life to go and what might help me most career wise.  I think I might start working towards a masters in healthcare management.  Can you get a double MBA?  I don't know - but I sort of miss taking classes.  Not that I love accounting so much (I had those kind of people in my class - who would be the type to get a cup of coffee and talk until midnight about revenue recognition), I just think that learning new things keeps my mind on.  Like exercise for the brain.  The thing about hda and my boyfriend is they are both like my dad in the way they've treated me.  They care about me, but not enough.  The net effect has made me feel like I'm just not quite good enough and upon reflection, I think I've just made poor choices.  (Because clearly I am worth it.)  My dad and I were close - I was a daddy's girl.  Went everywhere I could with him.  When I was in college he started dating someone and married this person - she was (and is) 7 years older than me.  She didn't like that my dad had an entire family (four daughters) and history without her.  She got jealous when he spent any time with us (I wish I was kidding - you want to talk unbalanced THAT is emotionally unbalanced).  Eventually he cut us out of his life.  For years I hated her.  I finally realized that was stupid.  It was just easier.  My dad was an adult and it was his choice to cut us out of his life, regardless of what someone demands of you, you always have the choice to do what you think is right.  So if I was going to hate anyone, I should hate him.  And I can't hate my dad - so I'm just sad about it.  I've got 2 kids he would just love and who would love him, and they don't know him.  Never seen anything but a picture.  For my dad it was mostly about money - his new wife is the only child of a rich family and money is not a problem.  They travel all over the place - last year it was Hawaii.  (and they generously sent my daughter a $10 bill for her birthday...)  He is living the life he always wanted to live.  The price was his relationship with his kids.  The boyfriend and hda aren't as extreme as that - but all the same - the choices they've made mean I'm not important enough.  Interesting how we tend to repeat idiotic patterns over and over in our lives.    They say the first step is realizing there is a problem.  Ditching the boyfriend and letting go of hda and moving on - easier said than done.  But a goal.  Finding someone who doesn't fit the current pattern. Ah. Well. That's the kicker, isn't it?  And while wanting to be loved (enough) is something I want, it isn't a goal.  It is more like icing.  I love my girls and they are my priority.  Maybe I should get a dog. (but isn't beastiality frowned on in most states?) I'm kidding! :) :)  People do manage to live without sex, don't they.  Not sure I think that is a healthy idea.  I've got to go.  k

      I used to watch TV all the time - always up on current events and kept up with all my favorite shows.  Between having two children who think the TV should always be on a cartoon and working for 2 years on my MBA, I got out of the habit.  I try to keep up with the world with Google news and seems like most of my favorite shows are gone.  Loved Frasier.  But I have to say my taste in TV rivals that of most nursing home residents.  Can't help it.  I know CSI and all those shows are riveting and I do really enjoy Without a Trace - but I don't like to be reminded all the time of the horrible things that human beings are capable of.  After awhile you get to where you don't want to make eye contact with anyone at the grocery store.  I used to work with a woman (whose door swung both ways, but that's another story) who got on a kick of reading about childhood sexual abuse.  She talked about it all day, every day for months.  Yes, there are sick people in the world, I would shoot them in the head and never feel a moment of remorse, I think it is horrible and sickening. BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE REMINDED OF IT DAILY AND JUST BECAUSE IT IS CONSUMING YOU, I DON'T WANT IT TO CONSUME ME.  I never said that - I think listening to people where they are in their life helps them.  I certainly get really upset if someone shuts down my train of thought in a conversation.  It is like you've been slapped.  So every day I listened to that for quite some time.  I kept thinking God owed me one.  Not sure he agreed, but we don't agree on a few things.  Where was I?  TV.  Right.  I love Matlock, Magnum PI, Monk, Murder, She Wrote and well....this one I cringe at revealing but I loved this show: Lois & Clark, the new adventures of Superman (you know Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher).  I think the Hallmark channel shows Magnum and Matlock but where I live now I don't get the Hallmark channel.  A&E used to show Murder, She Wrote and I think TNT used to show Lois & Clark - and of course Monk is on USA.  I never know when it comes on - and I think they have 3 new episodes a season or something.  I'd watch it every day.  The thing with all of those shows - can be violent (hey, we're solving MURDERS) but not gory, intense or depressing.  And we wrap it up in an hour and all is right with the world.    I don't want to watch a movie if it has a bad ending.  And I think sometimes Hollywood doesn't get how important that is.  Was anyone happy with how City of Angels (I think that was the name, Meg Ryan and what's his name - what is his name? married Elvis' daughter...hmmmm....anyway, you know) ended?  Was that really necessary?  I don't care.  I wanted happy.  That is why I loved Sense & Sensibility.  I'm usually annoyed with accent movies (unless we're talking Hugh Grant and I love that) but my sister was in some class that gave extra credit if she saw the movie.  I went, but had quite an attitude about it.  I had never read the book, so the whole story was new to me.  When I realized Hugh Grant had married the woman he promised himself to, I was so disappointed and thought - isn't it just the way, you meet the perfect man and he is so perfect, he does the 'right' thing and everyone is unhappy for the rest of their lives.  And the moment that we realize that the "Mrs." being referred to isn't Hugh's wife, but his brother's wife and that Hugh and the girl can be together - I burst into tears (as I'm doing now remembering that moment).  That was the best movie moment I've ever had - love that you thought would never happen, does happen.  The most happily ever moment - I guess because I identified so much with the girl and I'm always the one losing the 'perfect' man and I can't imagine a happier ever after for me than for that to happen.  Love that movie.  If I had read the book, wouldn't have impacted me so much and might feel differently.  But they got me hook, line and sinker there.  k

      I've tried channeling my obsessive writing to this blog and other friends - it isn't the same.  When I write, what comes out depends on the audience.  Nothing against you, but you aren't the audience I want right now.  Part of it is history.  To tell stories or make references, you need a context.  I could spend the next six months giving you context.  What I need is an outlet to babble where I'm at right now.  Why the events from the past have led me to this point, etc.  I surprised myself yesterday with the level of my anger and hurt.  I thought I was fine - and had convinced myself that all of this was for the best.  An event that will trigger a divorce faster, etc.  And if it doesn't, I'm the better person for it.  Not having had an affair, but finding out up front that nothing would ever change and moving on is the very best thing.  So easy to say and think - but I'm not there yet with my emotions.  I'm so tired.

      I had my weekly meeting today with my boss and hda.  I was hoping for some signal or sign that he even remotely missed my emails.  Nothing.  And we met at his office instead of the bar - I guess more professional than the bar.  It made me so mad because I felt like his wife had requested that.  My mean side wanted to say to him "no wonder you haven't had sex in years, you dickless wonder..." but he is still my boss and the president of the company and making derogatory comments about his manhood might not be a good move career wise.  Besides - I've noticed people (myself included) tend to latch on to negative comments.  Doesn't matter if it was said in a moment of anger and not really meant - it was said and hard to forget.  Years later the comment might come up again during a fight.  I try to keep that from happening by not saying the mean things I'd love to say.  I'm fairly good at cutting someone to the quick with a mean verbal jab - and a part of me is pleased and proud of this ability - but it is never good for either party in the long run.  Even if I'm pleased with myself at the time, I always feel bad later and hate to think they are running the phrase through their head a million times.  It seems we are all fragile in some areas - some people are fragile everywhere and others have thick skin - but even those have spots where, if you jab, they will bleed.    Even my mom said today that hda had to be missing me and it had only been a week - and my boss (ceo) was there so it wasn't like he could have said anything.  But I wanted him to want to talk to me alone and he didn't even remotely seem like that was a possibility.  I cried all the way home and have spent most of the evening crying - I didn't call my boyfriend until after 9pm because I didn't want him to know how upset I was.  Hard to explain that.  I'll do better as time goes by.  I may quit going to the Friday meetings.  Might be easier on everyone.    I did confide in my coworker today about it all.  My other friends told me to never tell anyone at work - but I trust J and I needed to talk to someone today and she was there.  I hope my trust doesn't backfire.    I know - life is full of much bigger problems and issues for others and if I ponder for 10 seconds I see my day in perspective as not that big of a deal.  But it is my world and it matters to me and I'm sad.    k

      For all my defending of my behavior - I really was rather compulsive about writing hda.  Everything that happened in my life - funny, sad, stupid, interesting - I would think "I've got to email hda..." and I couldn't wait to write.  I wrote him about nearly everything in my life.  And now I'm not allowed.  I have moments of deep sadness.  I'd love to just cry my eyes out - but hate doing that when my girls can see me - and my mom gets totally mad about crying.  I wonder if he feels a void or simply relief.    I had a meeting with bank people today - about 401k types of things.  Totally lost me.  People assume that you know everything about anything that involves numbers or money when you are an accountant.  I can do my job and I do it well - but sometimes people start babbling about taxes - and I'm not a tax accountant and I don't pretend to be one.  Or my boss will say things like "for example, if we can get 45% of the $800 and then 62% of that it would be what, k?" right in front of people he does this.  I always want to say "you see the 10-key on my desk? it is there for a reason."  Today he put me on the spot about our current 401k program.  I've been there 2 months and have seen nothing on it - he was sitting there with contracts and documents a plenty in front of him that I had never seen or knew I needed to know about.  He later said he was just teasing me but I thought asking me questions I can't possibly answer in front of strangers isn't exactly what I deem "hilarious."  My corporate weblog is going slowly - my sister is going to help me - she is great at such things.  She is out of the country and we are on opposite time zones and are never online at the same time.  I've been trying to find a good example of one online...since I'm not that creative I'm going to try to copy one that has features I like.    I've got a four year old to get to bed.  I'll try to be more entertaining tomorrow.  Going out with friends after work - maybe I'll have good stories to tell about that.  And some guy wants my screen name - I haven't forgotten.  :)

      I'm bordering on a rage type of anger.  I tend to do it mostly when I've had too much starch/sugars.  I'm not sure there is any medical evidence to support it, but it is definitely a trend for me.  Give me ice cream and it won't be long until I find something to jump up and down and yell about.  So I mostly avoid too much sugar/starch.    I'm not sure who is reading my blog family wise and I find myself wanting to spew a pageful of wrath towards one of them and I can't...which makes me even more mad.  To top it all off I had to work late, barely made it to daycare before it closed and I won't go into the layers of other annoyances that greeted me upon my arrival at home - but the kicker is my mom has been here all day - but I have to go buy groceries now because we are completely out of milk.  How insane is that?  Would it just have killed her to run to the store for me?  I really need to go now, but I decided to vent here instead of taking my irritation out on a pedestrian.   Completely unrelated, but it is amazing the difference a title makes.  All about perceptions.  Store.  Dammit.  Must go to store.

      What a day.  Nothing from hda - but I sent him some work related emails - maybe I shouldn't have.  I truly didn't say anything personal.  One of my friends is still worried all of this will cost me my job - I can't imagine that.    Today my boss and another coworker (the aforementioned 54 year old lady who likes to discuss sex) were in my office and we were teasing my boss about finding him a woman to date.  He is very date-able.  He's very tall, fairly good looking, lean with a great smile.  41 years old, makes great money, has a 6 year old son (his wife died).  Sometimes I find him attractive, but overall I'm not interested.  Anyway - somehow they got on the discussion of numbers and my boss said "well, I guess I'd say '8' is my favorite number because I like a figure 8 figure."  And J (the coworker) said "I wonder what a girl's favorite number would be?" And they both puzzled over this great mystery for a minute.  And I kept thinking "they must be kidding, it is so obvious." And neither said anything I finally said "uh...well...69."  And oh my!  J laughed and laughed as did my boss - but it seemed to be the last thing he expected to come out of my mouth.  I turned bright red and he said "well, I think I know some people who'd like to date you!"  It was all very entertaining.  He was in a good mood the rest of the afternoon.    more later

      My hda responded today to the email I sent him.  I was amused with thinking he caved and wrote me first...already breaking the terms of the new agreement.  Actually he wasn't really breaking the terms, but he said he did defend me to his wife and that was WHY they had the big fight.  So I'm not worth fighting for, but I'm at least worth fighting about.  I didn't reply.  I'm not giving C any ammunition to use against me.  But I was very pleased.  Right now I'm channeling my energy into creating a corporate blog for my company.  We have a website - but the doctors want something where they can exchange information.  I'm new at all of this, so I'm doing research online.  I don't know how to make it so they need a password to access it - they were wanting me to post the financials there and I can't do that even if I make it private someone *could* stumble across it accidentally.    I like my boss but he is one of those kinds of people who just calls an expert and gets things done - and later finds out it cost a fortune.  I just figure we have over 200 employees we certainly must have someone besides me who could maintain a blog for the company - why not use resources we are already paying for.    At some point I will detail the people I used to work for - 7 years - and most of it hell.  More than one person said my workplace was abusive - and I don't disagree.  But they paid me well and that's what it comes down to so often.  I can't afford to love my job but make very little doing it.  Right now I have both - I like it and get paid well.  Not that it doesn't have its moments - but they aren't daily.  My old job the moments of hate were constant.   But they loved me - I don't think they know I hate them.  My old boss was IMing me today and told me how much I was missed.    I'm so tired.

      Why do we do it to ourselves?  I guess to make sure we didn't dream the whole thing.  I've been at work awhile and have spent most of that going back and reading emails from hda.  I get mad and sad.  For starters - I have every email he ever sent me (and every one I ever sent him).  In January alone he sent me over 50 emails.  For a busy doctor, that is a huge amount.  But I'M the one who's obsessed?  I'm some freaky fatal attraction chick and he is just a victim?  Ok.  He never said he was a victim, but I imagine he never let his wife know he answered a significant number of my emails.  In a very specific and personal way.  Dammit.  It's raining and even though it isn't Monday, it feels like a Monday.  Talking to myself and feeling old.  Sometimes I'd like to quit.  Nothing ever seems to fit.  Hanging around.  Nothing to do but frown.  Rainy days and Mondays always gets me down.  What I've got they used to call the blues.  Nothing is really wrong.  Feeling like I don't belong.  Walking around.  Some kind of lonely clown.  I could go on.  I'm fairly good at remembering lyrics.  I don't really get down when it rains most of the time.  I'd be down if the sun was shining today.    And I was having a little chat with myself on the way to work.  Hda wasn't rejecting me exactly.  He was making a choice for his family and his marriage.  But it still feels like rejection.    The only one who is truly happy (I think) is my boyfriend.  He hasn't been this happy in months.  I've been trying to break up with him for awhile but now what's the point.    I should get busy.  And find something else to write about.  I stayed up late last night reading other blogs.  If I wasn't in this current funk, mine would be a more entertaining read.  I'll drink my Dr. Pepper and the sugar and caffeine might kick start my personality and I'll get back with you.  k

      I feel (right now) like my situation with hda is like a 12-year-old with a crush on her teacher.  And that's not the way it was.  But it is how I'm feeling.  Things had kind of shifted back to where we were emailing again and he went on vacation for a week - since he's been back we are back to where we were right after he gave me the underdog "looks like this is the end" speech.    I've got the emails to prove my side - as if anyone but me cares.  His wife cares, but she's won the war, so may not really give a damn.  I found out this week that she (his wife) gets up at 4:30 every morning because she has an "email addiction" (her words).  Great.  That means that when I was emailing him (until I got the heave-ho) at home she was most likely reading all the emails I sent to him the night before...maybe even deleting the ones she didn't want him to read.  (he did let me know she knew his password and had access to his emails YOU KNOW, AFTER 4 MONTHS OF ME USING HIS HOME EMAIL ADDRESS...ASSHOLE)  Anyway - it just reinforced in my mind that she had read many of them and I still find that humiliating.  Not just because I was open about my feelings for him, but I was open about everything in my life - and I wouldn't have shared that if I thought the email was open access.    So.  It has been 2 months since he ended our friendship.  I am doing better.  Another month and I should be good to go.  Just wish I wanted to let it go.  There are no other rational options, but it isn't what I want to do.   However.  I've decided to give my bf another chance and quit comparing him to hda.  He brought me a dozen roses today - and I thought of Jay's blog where he talked about a cowboy buying flowers and how that woman should feel lucky.  He's not a bad guy.   Deep sigh.  I've got another story to tell, but I'll start another post for it....I started this one and hour and 1/2 ago - but got sidetracked with a couple of crisis (nothing major) here at home....  kim

      I’m cheating tonight.&nbsp; I wrote a newsy email to my friends and I’m going to post it here, some of it is stuff I’ve said to you before, but it was new to them.&nbsp; I’ve edited out names and places to protect the innocent.&nbsp;  Hidey ho neighbors.&nbsp; Once again weeks (months?) have gone by without a single hello from Kim - the one who used to send daily (or more often) updates on her life.&nbsp; I'll try to refrain from using colorful metaphors as I've discovered that a few of you who work in a large corporations have emails scanners that automatically refuse to allow emails in with that sort of language. (What's up with that, anyway?)  I think I've now survived four board meetings.&nbsp; This last one only had 9 people - the voting board only (keeping out the riff-raff) and me and Boss.&nbsp; Boss is cool as a cucumber most of the time - until the board meeting starts.&nbsp; Then he shifts into this mode that reminds me of my dad watching tv and reading the newspaper at the same time - all the while I'm trying to tell him a story.&nbsp; He's there, he may look at me - but we all know he isn't really listening.&nbsp; He's disengaged, unfocused and distracted.&nbsp; When my dad would do that to me I'd eventually start saying things like "then I took a knife and stabbed her.&nbsp; Blood was everywhere.&nbsp; I had to clean it up." and he would never blink. (Did I mention Boss is my boss? Boss is my boss, by the way.)&nbsp; Anyway - this is how Boss acts at the meetings.&nbsp; He really made me mad at this meeting.&nbsp; I had my customary strawberry daiquiri (who really wants a sober accountant anyway) and I was fine.&nbsp; The smaller crowd made me feel more at ease.&nbsp; Not relaxed, mind you, just not freaking out.&nbsp; I think because with the smaller group I don't feel like any of them are out to get me - that sounds paranoid and that isn't what I mean.&nbsp; It is just that when there are 20 of them there, some of them like to sound like know-it-alls and that can mean they might decide to ask me a complex question so they'll look smart...they probably don't even overly care if I answer it correctly, that isn't the point.&nbsp; But I hate looking stupid and hate being put on the spot and can seriously barely remember how to count to ten in the right order during my part of the meeting.&nbsp; A complex accounting question is the last thing I want.&nbsp; You know how it is.&nbsp; So.&nbsp; Where was I?&nbsp; Oh. Boss.&nbsp; I have a powerpoint thing I do for them - and Boss has a couple of poorly structured spreadsheets.&nbsp; I do mine, he does his.&nbsp; Except.&nbsp; When we got to the page where he needed to step in and babble, he just kept looking at papers in front of him, totally not clued in.&nbsp; I leaned over and said, "we are to the part that you do" and he said (looking confused that I would say this at this moment in time) "you're glad this is my part to do?" and I thought - well, that isn't what I said, but the gist is right - it is your freakin' (see, used a less crude term just to please the internet gods) turn!&nbsp; Get on it, buddy boy.&nbsp; He still did not.&nbsp; Hda, the board president and my friend (aka Dr. Hda) tried to help him out by asking a few pointed questions about the information on one of the sheets.&nbsp; Boss mumbled a senseless reply and still did not do anything.&nbsp; It was awkward and weird and I just want to slap the (uhhhh) snot out of him, or shake him violently and say "focus!"&nbsp; I can present that part too - I just don't like to.&nbsp; I think the information is presented poorly and since it is Boss's and not mine- he should explain it.&nbsp; Anyway.&nbsp; Boss doesn't drink at the meetings and I think he should.  Since I don't talk at the meetings (sometimes I think of comments or questions, but since I'm not a board member or a doctor, I just figure listening is what I should do - and give my comments and ask my questions later) it is a good time to analyze the doctors.&nbsp; Interesting mix of personalities.&nbsp; One of the doctors - this may be too crude to say but I don't care - well.&nbsp; Let me back up.&nbsp; He's a family practice guy and is short - but not in a midget way - but short enough that you think "short." And really - if I think short - well - you know - he must be.&nbsp; He was sitting the way some guys do - legs spread (and I crudely think, are you airing out your balls here? i mean: what is that about?) and I decided he must have those hangy-down old man balls.&nbsp; hee Then I thought - he would not appreciate knowing I was thinking that during the board meeting.&nbsp; But hey - he put the package out there.&nbsp; How can I not look?&nbsp; My mom says she never ever looks.&nbsp; I can't even imagine that.&nbsp; Maybe I'm a freak.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; I used to think if you couldn't see the package, there wasn't much to see - but now that I'm older and wiser - I know that we have show-ers and grow-ers.&nbsp; You know what I'm saying.&nbsp; So.&nbsp; Short man.&nbsp; Where was I?&nbsp; He isn't bad looking - has a huge nose.&nbsp; Otherwise, like a surfer dude sort.&nbsp; Did you ever watch The Real World Los Angeles?&nbsp; I think it was around 1995 or so.&nbsp; The one with the guy from Kentucky who sang country songs.&nbsp; There was a blond guy on there who was going to school - really smart and good looking.&nbsp; Add 20 years to that guy and you've got this doctor.&nbsp; Oh and add 3 inches to his nose.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; He is like a little pit bull.&nbsp; Sometimes he seems sarcastic and funny - other times he just seems cranky and slightly mean-spirited.&nbsp; He never wants the group to spend any money on anything, ever.&nbsp; But this meeting he told Boss that no expense should be spared on getting enough bandwidth for the computers.&nbsp; I wanted to say "I'M SORRY, HOW MUCH OF THIS DAIQUIRI HAVE I HAD? I THOUGHT DR. S SAID MONEY WAS NO OBJECT.&nbsp; CAN WE GET HIM TO SAY THAT AGAIN, CLEARLY INTO THE TAPE RECORDER, PLEASE?"&nbsp; I cracked myself up with that one.&nbsp; Naturally I sat there blandly listening.&nbsp;   I don't have time to make fun of every doctor - at least not right now.&nbsp; Not all of them are make funable.&nbsp; But some of them are nearly cartoonish.&nbsp; Thank God, none of them in the T [kim says: this is my old boss, hate him, long story] *sshole from hello sort.&nbsp; One is insane, but in a different way.&nbsp; One of them - he used to be the board president.&nbsp; He's an old guy - and he stutters and has a lisp.&nbsp; I think: Elmer Fudd when he talks and I have a hard time taking him seriously.&nbsp; Before the meeting really got underway he and Hda were discussing who was Hda1 and Hda2 (because, obviously now, old guy doc is also Hda).&nbsp; Then I said Hda sounded a lot like God (not my own thinking, but seemed like a good time to bring it up). Old doc perked up and said I would do well with their company with that kind of thinking and then he said something like people were always getting the two of them (you know him and God) confused.&nbsp; I said "yes, I bet that happens all the time" and smiled at him.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's the sort you make a lot of eye contact with and have a look on your face that seems to say "wow, you're a doctor, and i feel honored that you are even speaking to little ole me."&nbsp; And I kid you not, the old doc really perked up when I said that - like for a moment he might have really believed I thought people mixed him up with God. hee hee&nbsp; He told me after the meeting what a great job I was doing for the company.&nbsp; Kim the suck up scored a point.&nbsp; The down side is he is the fair weather type - I'm fairly certain if I made him mad tomorrow (hey, you know what - you and God aren't even remotely alike!!) he would be first in line to get me fired.&nbsp; He doesn't bother me, I'm just saying - I liked the compliment, but kind of took it with a grain of salt.&nbsp;   This is completely unrelated, but I figured if I could talk about old man hangy balls, this next topic would be ok as well.&nbsp; It is about farting.&nbsp; Now.&nbsp; I grew up understanding this unpleasantness should only ever happen in the bathroom.&nbsp; I haven't lived at home in 20 years and I moved beyond this wicked teaching.&nbsp; Some might say I've strayed too far off the path.&nbsp; At any rate - two quick stories.&nbsp; The first is that I noticed when I had a cold, my farts didn't stink.&nbsp; I was amazed at this phenomenon and was happy that I didn't have to hold any of them in during that time.&nbsp; Well, duh.&nbsp; A person can't SMELL when they have a cold - so well.&nbsp; I guess I grossed people out for a couple of weeks last year.&nbsp; I wish I was joking - but it didn't occur to me until after my cold was gone that this freakish phenomenon was just me having a really blonde moment.&nbsp; The other story is.&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; Sometimes they really don't smell.&nbsp; So.&nbsp; After several times of being discreet you realize there is no need because no one can smell them anyway, why let your tummy or butt be uncomfortable, let those bad boys out.&nbsp; So.&nbsp; I'm at the grocery store. (have I told you these before?) In line.&nbsp; Behind this really old lady.&nbsp; She looks older than nursing home residents.&nbsp; She is slow and having trouble writing her check.&nbsp; I need to let one go.&nbsp; So I do.&nbsp; But.&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; This one WASN'T the non-smelly kind.&nbsp; This was one of those that brings tears to your eyes and melts wallpaper.&nbsp; You wonder if there is a hole in your pants from the acid that must have blown right out of your behind.&nbsp; I looked nonchalant (denial - remember the key in life is always denial) and then slightly disgusted.&nbsp; I looked pointedly at the old lady.&nbsp; So the cashier looked at me and then the old lady with a look that said "my god, did her fart stink or what?"&nbsp; The person behind me shifted uncomfortably but they, too, believed the little old lady let it rip in a nasty way.&nbsp; I felt like a big jerk, but I was so glad they bought my non-verbal cues that the old lady did it.  Have you ever noticed if you are around someone who farts (especially in a social situation with strangers) that people sniff loudly?&nbsp; What are they trying to do?&nbsp; Sniff as much of that up their nose as possible?&nbsp; Mostly I think it is the universal: I smell it, but I didn't do it, and it is horrible signal.&nbsp; Same thing if someone walks into a bathroom where someone was 'busy' you might say.&nbsp; A lot of loud sniffing.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; Sometimes I find myself doing it - more of a "is that what I think it is?" sort of sniff and then "oh, dear god, yes, it is" sniff.&nbsp; Then "why am I sniffing up crap fog?" hee :)  It's way past my bedtime (otherwise I wouldn't feel so free to be this crude...amazing how being up late alters perspectives).&nbsp;   I still love my new job, but manage to show my temperamental personality already too much.&nbsp; Amazingly, no one seems to mind.&nbsp; Not once has anyone come into my office and chatted with me about my attitude problems.&nbsp; Yay.&nbsp; I got really mouthy one day with my boss - I don't know what came over me.&nbsp; He is always saying things to me like "80 percent of 4000 and then 22 percent of that minus 40 is what, Kim?"&nbsp; I never even try to figure it out in my head - am I supposed to?&nbsp; At any rate, he seems to think I should be capable of it.&nbsp; One day he said that to me and I said "here's an idea, use a calculator, that's what I do - that 's why it is on my desk."&nbsp; I was immediately shocked and horrified.&nbsp; But he laughed and teased me about my insubordination being related to the fact that bf was in town (some weird idea that sex brought out that in me....).&nbsp; I decided it was best to play along with that notion.&nbsp;   I said I was going to bed.&nbsp; I am.&nbsp; Hope all is well with all of yous. :)  kim&nbsp;   I forgot to mention - the old lady in the grocery store who I blamed for the smell.&nbsp; She was very fragile looking - and I thought the smell was going to kill her (it seemed like the kind that might knock a person over).&nbsp; She wavered a bit and was even more unsteady writing her check.&nbsp; I knew this was because she was about to be overcome and it only added to the other people's notion that she let it rip and was probably dealing with butt aftershocks - making her unsteady for a moment.  I'm terrible.  good night,  kim

      After reading his response,&nbsp; a friend of mine decided he (hda) had a God complex.&nbsp; I think it is typical of doctors to be arrogant - and he is the president of the company, so he has a point (that it was his right to know), but he missed mine entirely.&nbsp; The point was he himself thought the only person who had given him the nugget he blasted the other doctor with, was me.&nbsp; He didn't care about the consequences I would face - he just wanted to win a pissing contest.&nbsp; I think he is confused at my irritation - I didn't get in trouble, no harm, no foul.&nbsp; Maybe I'm making too much out of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; All I know is he has decided not to be the president next year, so I can't always count on him having my back.&nbsp; And that means he'll not be getting any nuggets of information from the leery accountant any more. :)&nbsp;   kim

      Hmm.&nbsp; I guess in three years when I look back on what I’ve written, it won’t seem boring – it will be a snapshot of what was going on in my life at this time.&nbsp; Good point, crypto.&nbsp; All about perspective, isn’t it.  Today my snapshot is of an angry accountant who feels she has been used.&nbsp; To make this make sense I should give you the whole story, but I don’t think I have time right now.&nbsp; I think the quick version is that I’ve been being a willing mole for hda – I work at the admin office.&nbsp; He is the president, but he is never at this office and only has my boss’s insight/information to know what is really going on.&nbsp; So I’ve been helpfully filling in the blanks that my boss leaves out.&nbsp; I know my boss is basically aware of this – after all, hda got me the job.&nbsp; It has put him in an awkward spot.&nbsp; He can’t get really say anything to me about it because I would tell hda – which could bring up a discussion of “why? Do you have something you are hiding?” kind of thing.&nbsp; It is impossible to keep me out of the loop on most things – as most things eventually are finance related.&nbsp; Coworker Jan warned me that this train would derail eventually and I would be sorry. &nbsp;I mentally told her to shut up because I’m perfectly capable of handling my work life.&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; At the board meeting on Thursday hda confronted another doctor with information that doctor didn’t know he knew.&nbsp; It was sort of a childish my-balls-are-bigger-than-yours scene. &nbsp;Since the meeting the doctor who was called on the carpet confronted my boss – wondering how on earth hda knew about that situation.&nbsp; My boss said “I didn’t tell him.”&nbsp; And my boss talked to hda and he said “I didn’t hear it from you.”&nbsp; JESUS.&nbsp; I know all of this because my boss came in my office yesterday with this whole story – basically putting it in my lap to explain how hda knew this information.&nbsp; I find that while confession may be good for the soul, it rarely has a good outcome in any other situation. &nbsp;So I listened, looking somewhat puzzled about the situation.&nbsp; Ok.&nbsp; To you I will confess.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I did tell hda – I told him the whole thing.&nbsp; I forwarded an email to him that detailed the whole plan the other doctor had. &nbsp;He knew the ins and outs of the entire situation.&nbsp; HOWEVER.&nbsp; In our weekly meetings with hda – in this particular circumstance – my boss HAD told him about it.&nbsp; Thank God that conversation finally peeked over the horizon in my brain – so I told my boss “you did tell him that at our weekly meeting one time – you said this, he said that, then you said this and he said that.”&nbsp; It was like a light bulb went on over my boss’s head.&nbsp; I had remembered enough of the conversation to make him remember it as well.&nbsp; (see: I was wise not to confess.)&nbsp;   There are many things that make me mad about this, but the thing that makes me the most mad is that hda told my boss “I didn’t hear this from you.”&nbsp; I’m the only other person who would have told him – I'm not the only other person who knew, but I’m the only one who would have said anything.&nbsp; Basically he didn’t care if he got me in trouble – he’d rather look like a big dog with big balls who knows all because he has the accountant under his thumb.&nbsp; At least that is how I’m taking it.&nbsp; I let him know what I thought (my email to him:  (he didn’t reply to the first one so I sent it again and added this to the top of it):  The more I thought about this, the madder I got.&nbsp; That you didn’t even bother to say you were sorry makes me think you’re an asshole.   (this is the one I sent yesterday after my boss left my office):  Boss came in my office this afternoon talking about how did HDA know about WB’s XYZ situation? – and he said you told him “I didn’t get it from you.” JESUS. (imagine me looking at you bug-eyed right now)&nbsp; Jan would never tell you something like that so Boss knew it was me.&nbsp; WB let him have it about leaking that to you and he told him he hadn’t.  The thing is, Boss did tell you about it at the June 4th weekly meeting we had in your office – you said it was a board decision and started talking about what if you decided to start selling vitamins in your office, etc.&nbsp; I did tell you about it, but so did Boss.&nbsp;   But shit, fuck and damn.&nbsp; What if he hadn’t told you?&nbsp; I guess that’s the chance I take being the company mole.&nbsp; I have a feeling Boss told him I was the one who told you.&nbsp; I can live with that, just hope he (WB) doesn’t start lobbying to get my ass fired.  &nbsp;***********************************************************  I’ve got a lot of work to do so I can’t really keep babbling about this.&nbsp;&nbsp; But all night I was stewing about it.&nbsp; I got myself out of trouble, but that is beside the point.&nbsp; The point is he didn’t care if I got in trouble.&nbsp; He used me.&nbsp; The same way he uses me to piss off his wife when they are fighting.&nbsp; How could I have been so stupid to think he ever cared about me?&nbsp; Thank god I didn’t sleep with him.&nbsp; Imagine how used I’d feel then.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; I’m sofa king we todd did.

      Goldilocks was a real pain in the ass - I'm aware of that.&nbsp; It's always important to be aware that you have a problem.   My sister brought me 2 or 3 big boxes of clothes from her daughter - her daughter is 2 years older than my Molly girl.&nbsp; She is a tall, thin girl and Molly is.&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; I should post a picture because she is beautiful, but she isn't built like her cousin.&nbsp; Her physique reminds me of those little gymnast girls - sturdy legs, etc.&nbsp; And she can&nbsp;nail a cartwheel at four years old...so hmmmmm.&nbsp; At any rate - my sister has donated hand-me-downs a couple of times - not sure what she does with the clothes in the years she doesn't give them to me - but she waits too long.&nbsp; Over half of the stuff in the boxes is too small - in part because Molly is not the same shape as her cousin, but in part because my sister took forever to gather them to give them to me.&nbsp; It isn't like the niece outgrew these clothes yesterday.&nbsp; Molly could have worn all of them last year.&nbsp; And.&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; This is rude of me but I'm not really fond of hand-me-downs from this sister because she has a cat and a dog and she isn't the world's best housekeeper.&nbsp; The clothes (have been washed and folded) have a funky smell.&nbsp; Now maybe it is&nbsp;just that thing where everyone's home has its own smell.&nbsp; You know what I mean.&nbsp; But I'm very sensitive to odors and even if it isn't unpleasant, if it is strong at all, it'll give me a headache.&nbsp; So today I've been washing piles of clothes that fit no one.&nbsp; They won't fit Jackie for at least 2 years, maybe longer.&nbsp; She is smaller than Molly - it could be 3 years before she can wear them.&nbsp; So.&nbsp; I'm not exactly full of free storage space here.&nbsp; What I feel like is that my sister just dumped her crap on me to do something with.&nbsp; I'm thinking Goodwill.&nbsp; Not sure if that will make my sister mad.&nbsp; But I've been annoyed all day at the laundry I'm doing.&nbsp; What a waste of time and energy.&nbsp; But I was sick of looking at the boxes of clothes, so I dumped them out and got rid of the boxes.&nbsp;   I've had a migraine most of the day.&nbsp; Which led to a really poor parenting moment.&nbsp; No harm done, but it is the sort of thing that could have gone wrong and tragedy would have ensued.&nbsp; To give a little background the girls and I had gone to K-Mart and while there I got Molly a game (and Jackie a video).&nbsp; But before we reached the car Molly had a meltdown and let Jackie know she hated her.&nbsp; Very nice.&nbsp; So I had a talk with Molly and let her know the game we bought would just stay in the trunk of the car.&nbsp; She sulked all the way home.&nbsp; We had been home awhile and the girls were playing on the floor in the living room and watching a cartoon, I was laying on the couch and I fell asleep.&nbsp; I woke up hearing the girls fighting over a game.&nbsp; I finally got myself awake and looked - and they were sitting there with the new game all spread out everywhere.&nbsp; I couldn't believe what I was seeing.&nbsp; I asked how that was even possible - Molly said "I got your keys, went outside, opened the trunk of the car and got the game, put your keys back, locked the front door and opened the game."&nbsp; I was stunned.&nbsp; And we've had episodes with them going outside without me before, so not only did she know better on that front - but she knew the game was off limits.&nbsp; Even thinking back on it I can't believe she did all of that.&nbsp; I don't live in a bad neighborhood -but she's four.&nbsp; She doesn't ever need to be outside alone ESPECIALLY WITH THE CAR KEYS.&nbsp; I guess I'm going to have to install some kind of lock on the door she can't open.&nbsp; She may be in high school before I let her play with the new game.&nbsp; I still feel overwhelmed with guilt that I was so soundly asleep that she could open the front door and leave and I didn't even know it. Can't let that happen again. Shudder.&nbsp;   I don't feel like talking about my hurt feelings from last week.&nbsp; I'm doing better - I've let it go.&nbsp; I can't change it and moping wasn't helping anyone.&nbsp;   I made bf mad today - I told him to take the Fitness Flyer piece o' crap back to his parents or wherever it came from and he said he would just take it to a dumpster.&nbsp; I thought that was stupid and I felt like it was his way of being childish - punishing me for not being grateful for the gift.&nbsp; He knows I don't approve of throwing useful items away.&nbsp; Sell it or give it away, but don't just throw it away.&nbsp; That's just stupid and wasteful.&nbsp; All the same - I'm tired of having it in my house.&nbsp; Jackie likes to play on it but it is not a workout for me - and that is what I wanted and needed.&nbsp; He is going back to Utah tomorrow - he says he'll be gone 3 weeks.&nbsp; If we see him before September I'll be surprised.&nbsp; I don't care - but hate it for the girls.&nbsp;   Do you ever watch the Surreal Life?&nbsp; The one with Ron Jeremy and Vanilla Ice?&nbsp; I don't ever make a point to watch it, but seems like I've watched it 2 or 3 times - a lot for me.&nbsp; I liked Vanilla Ice when he was popular - but he is so weird and immature.&nbsp; Tammy Faye is about what I expected.&nbsp; Erik Estrada is a nicer guy than I expected and I like Ron Jeremy.&nbsp; Last night Gooch, I mean Gary Coleman was on it.&nbsp; Not sure why - but that little man.&nbsp; He has some emotional problems.&nbsp; He takes life and himself way too seriously.&nbsp;   I've got %$#@## laundry to fold....   kim

      Board meeting over.&nbsp; Company gone.&nbsp; Headache arrived.&nbsp; Feelings hurt.&nbsp; Some crying.   It wasn't an altogether bad week - one of the doctors (used to be the president) asked me to do a return on investment analysis on a ancillary operation he wants to pursue.&nbsp; That isn't something I generally do, but in theory it is something I should be able to do.&nbsp; I did worry that it would turn into one of those ignore-the-man-behind-the-curtain moments, but it did not.&nbsp; Somehow I was able to get it together knocking those peas around in my head and produce real numbers for him.&nbsp; He was so impressed he bragged on and on about me at the board meeting.&nbsp; My hda also said nice things about me at the meeting, which was nice, but having one of them that I'm not friends with give me validation made me feel good.&nbsp;   Hda is actually the reason my feelings are hurt and I cried today but I don't feel like talking about it right now.&nbsp;   My boss - who let last month's meeting turn into a fiasco - was still not as assertive as he needed to be at the meeting.&nbsp; I think it is interesting in a way.&nbsp; The meetings make me nervous, everyone who knows me knows that - and now I always suck down a daiquiri the minute I get there to give myself some liquid courage.&nbsp; It works for me even if somewhat unwise.&nbsp; My boss is a tall, good-looking man who is very self-confident one on one - in the office, on the phone, etc.&nbsp; But in front of the doctors at the board meeting, he seems&nbsp;distracted and unfocused.&nbsp; I wanted to shake him last night and say FOCUS! but it isn't my place.&nbsp; I can only guess this way of turning into a butterfly at the meetings is how he deals with being nervous - although he would say he is not nervous.&nbsp;   I feel like I act butterflyish the day of the meeting - I can't seem to sit still and flit around unfocused.&nbsp; But when the meeting starts, I'm all there, completely in tune.&nbsp; The drink calms me and I'm able to stay lucid while speaking.&nbsp;   I have more to say, but I'll stop here for now.  kim

      I'm waving madly to my 3 readers....! Did you miss me?&nbsp; How are you?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  My family is still in town and I don't want them to know about my blog - besides - it is so chaotic most of the time, if I wrote from home it would be so much less than lucid I might have to just say "incoherent ramblings" instead.  &nbsp;  And this is board meeting week at work - so my boss has lots of projects for me - taking away precious work blogging time, dammit.  &nbsp;  Hda has been out of town on vacation, so I have no new stories there.&nbsp; He is back today, but his schedule is slammed, I don't expect to hear from him until tomorrow.&nbsp; I wrote him every day he was gone because.&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; I'm just psycho like that.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  My bf is still home - he was nearly absent all weekend, but last week was a great help with my girls.  &nbsp;  My mom is depressed and having her at my home seems to suck the very joy out of living. :)&nbsp; How's that for cheery?&nbsp; Maybe that is overstated, but it takes a lot of energy to deal with someone who is depressed.&nbsp; I feel like I have to do the equivalent of a tap dance all the time to keep her spirits up and when I come home from work - I really don't feel like putting on the tap shoes.&nbsp; My sister doesn't really understand what my mom needs and tends to make her more depressed with her overly honest comments.&nbsp; We are having fun here.  &nbsp;  I've gotta go to lunch.&nbsp; Just wanted you to know I was still here.&nbsp; Will catch up with you soon.&nbsp; A wave to Crypto, Sloth and b.&nbsp; :)  &nbsp;  kim

      I know if I take a minute to write in my blog, my boss will come to work.&nbsp; One of those constants of the universe.&nbsp; I need him to come in, so it is just as well. &nbsp;Seems like Fridays around here are do-whatever-the-hell-you-want-do days.&nbsp; The casual Friday idea going too far.&nbsp; I don’t really care what everyone else does if it doesn’t affect me.&nbsp; At work, anyway.&nbsp; Not a general world view of mine or anything.  &nbsp;  My blog seems to be messed up and I swear I didn’t do anything to make this happen.&nbsp; At least I don’t think so.&nbsp; The links, etc. on the right hand side are now all the way at the bottom of the page. &nbsp;Is this something I can fix, does anyone know?  &nbsp;  My mom is on her way to visit me – she is bringing one of my sisters and her daughter (my niece) with her.&nbsp; This isn’t the sister I’m close with.&nbsp; Last year I was in the toilet financially and (in my mind) I was of no use to her in that state.&nbsp; Over the years she and her deadbeat husband have ‘let’ me give them thousands of dollars.&nbsp; Last year when I needed help, they didn’t offer a dime, didn’t offer to watch my girls so I wouldn’t have to pay daycare costs ($1000/month) (and my sister doesn’t work, so this would not have been a hardship, just personally annoying to her), and didn’t help me when I needed just labor type help during moving.&nbsp; When I give someone money I never think of it as a loan, I try to never give more away than I can afford to be without (I’ve broken this rule a time or two and regretted it!).&nbsp; So I’m not really looking for the money back.&nbsp; But I guess I figure when I need help, if they can help, they will. &nbsp;And when they don’t, I’m stunned.&nbsp; I can’t imagine being that way.&nbsp; Taking and not giving.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So.&nbsp; They will visit.&nbsp; Get on my last damned nerve.&nbsp; Make rude comments to me and my girls.&nbsp; And I’ll thank god when I see the taillights of their vehicle as they travel back home. J&nbsp; Family.&nbsp; Gotta love ‘em.&nbsp; Right?  &nbsp;  Do you know the song “New Orleans Ladies”?&nbsp; When I moved here in 1990 it was an “oldie” on the radio but I had never heard it before – I guess it was more popular locally than all over the country.&nbsp; It is a beautiful song…heard it on the radio this morning and it is lingering in my head.  &nbsp;  Boss still isn’t here.&nbsp; Damn.&nbsp; Maybe I’ll take an early lunch…heh heh heh  &nbsp;  kim

        I'm playing with the fonts and colors - is this a new feature or am I just really that unobservant?&nbsp; Oh, don't answer that.&nbsp; I hate knowing if I'm that dingy.        &nbsp;    Do you ever find yourself sabotaging the very thing you want?&nbsp; Being your own worst enemy, keeping you from something you say (and feel) you want very much?&nbsp; I have a problem in this area and I can't seem to figure out the problem.&nbsp; Do I fear success?&nbsp; Am I afraid if I get what I want, I still won't be happy, so it is easier to say "if I had such-and-such I would be happy" but always keeping it just out of my reach as a handy excuse for not being happy?&nbsp; Am I even making any sense?        &nbsp;    My job is accounting - and yet in my personal life, I'm terrible with it.&nbsp; I used to be very nearly obsessive compulsive about my bills - even when I didn't have much money I would spend hours analyzing what I had, what I could pay, when I could pay what I couldn't pay right now, etc.&nbsp; I balanced my checkbook daily and would even keep track of what days the checks cleared - so I could know if I wrote a check to x-y-z it would take 3 days to clear - so 3 days before payday I could write a check.&nbsp; That sort of thing.&nbsp; It wasn't just random tracking, it had a purpose.&nbsp; When you are poor you do what you can to keep things going.&nbsp; Now I have more money and I'm terrible about staying on top of my bills.&nbsp; It doesn't even make sense - the money is there and yet I'll go around for 2 weeks with my bills in my purse, unpaid.&nbsp; I can't explain it or figure it out.&nbsp; It goes against my nature.&nbsp; And it is one of those things that nags at me and hangs over my head.&nbsp; And then I'm annoyed at what I see as a character flaw because I think: just do it and get it over with and quit letting it get to you, crazy girl.&nbsp; But I don't.&nbsp; One might be thinking: get the hell off blogger, girl, and pay your fucking bills.&nbsp; I will in a minute.&nbsp; Promise.&nbsp;        &nbsp;    When hda told me about this job I have he already knew I was having financial problems.&nbsp; I had a bad year last year and money wasn't the only problem, but it was a big one.&nbsp; I told him everything - at first I hesitated to mention the money problem in part because I didn't think he would understand and I also didn't want him to think I was hinting for help.&nbsp; He let me know that just because he was&nbsp;a "rich doctor" didn't mean he didn't have financial problems - and he told me all about his personal finances, stupid decisions that led to the financial house-of-cards he himself was living in.&nbsp; And in comparison to mine, his were much worse.&nbsp; But still.&nbsp; He is offering me the job as the accountant for his company knowing I was struggling personally.&nbsp; I didn't think it made sense. (although I would argue a lot of people would have given up and declared bankruptcy and I managed to hold it all together - credit bruised but not completely in the toilet)&nbsp; When I told him as much he said "A housekeeper might live in a messy house.&nbsp; I counsel people daily about their sex lives and mine would put anyone to sleep.&nbsp; Having financial problems does not mean you aren't a good accountant."&nbsp; His confidence in me did a lot for my self-esteem.        &nbsp;    I guess I'm saying that because I'm thinking how I spent last year struggling and now I have money to pay my bills and I still can't bring myself to get it taken care of.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate it when I can't figure out why I do the things I do.        &nbsp;    I need sleep....but I'll work on the bills right now.&nbsp; I promise.        &nbsp;    kim

        Today was a pretty good day - had a few annoyances - always a joy killer along the way.&nbsp; Today it was my mom.&nbsp; She called and during the conversation I said something about hda - instead of commenting she started asking me questions about my 2 year old (Jackie).&nbsp; It was her way of letting me know she didn't want to hear it.&nbsp; That makes me so mad I want to just hang up.&nbsp; Why does she decide what I can and can't talk about?&nbsp; Screw you.&nbsp; Of course I said nothing - I just answered her question - in one of those in-as-few-words-as-possible-so-I-can-hang-up-soon sort of ways.&nbsp; For starters, she is full of boring conversations of her own - which I listen to endlessly.&nbsp; If it is a moral problem (I refuse to let you talk about a married man to me) well - that just makes me that much more mad.&nbsp; She sits pretty high on her moral high horse.&nbsp; I think it is hypocritical or ironic or some such word when people get holier-than-thou when the topic is sex - but on things like how you treat people - that is a non-issue to them.&nbsp; I think how you treat people is more important than most things.&nbsp; And listening to someone who needs to talk goes a long way in my book.&nbsp; I always feel slapped in the face when someone cuts off my conversation for no other reason than they are tired of listening to it.&nbsp; The topic bores them or whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And she switched the conversation to Jackie - Molly had the surgery but she is more concerned with how it is affecting Jackie - is she upset that Molly is getting so much attention, etc.&nbsp; My mom doesn't get along with Molly - and plays favorites.&nbsp; It is scarily obvious.&nbsp; She accuses me of favoring Molly over Jackie - and I think because her own view is so skewed she can't see that I treat them equally.&nbsp; It is a sore subject so switching to talking about Jackie was the last thing she needed to do in my mind.&nbsp; She will be here this weekend - damn.&nbsp; Wish she could find a job.&nbsp; She said she was going to job hunt while she was here. Oh. Great.       &nbsp;   And bf is helping me - he's watching Molly for me this week.&nbsp; He cleaned house, did the dishes, went to the grocery store yesterday, vacuumed, etc.&nbsp; But as soon as I got home from work he went to his house (about an hour away).&nbsp; It made me feel like he had had enough and needed to go home and regroup.&nbsp; I know if you don't live with little kids all the time, they can overwhelm you.&nbsp; BUT THEY ARE HIS KIDS.&nbsp; And they aren't terrors or anything.&nbsp; Just disappoints me - and his next job might take him to Cuba and because it pays well, he is willing to go.&nbsp;&nbsp; No matter how many times I tell him the girls need a daddy more than they need money - it is like he doesn't hear me.&nbsp;&nbsp;        &nbsp;   Work is fine.&nbsp; Hda is on vacation, so no new stories there.&nbsp; I'm not really expecting any.&nbsp;&nbsp; Trying to think if I have any new boss stories.&nbsp; I don't think so - things had gotten weird between us for awhile, but we seem to be ok now.       &nbsp;   The girls think I should&nbsp;cook dinner.&nbsp; More later if I get a chance.       &nbsp;   kim&nbsp;

      My bf is here and doesn't care for the competition with the computer, so I may not be able to be online as much.  Let me rephrase that.  I can be online as much as I want - my home, my life.  I hate to be rude and he really doesn't get why I'm online so much.  He doesn't know anything about blogging - and I want it to stay that way.  He would be hurt if he'd read what I had written.  So.  I'll catch when I'm at work tomorrow (heh heh heh).  Molly's surgery went fine.  We were there at 6:45am and they didn't start her surgery until 9:30 or 10:00 (I don' wear a watch).  She is a very clingy mommy's girl when she is in a new situation - and one of those kids who screams and cries when separated from their mommy.  They gave her some kind of valium (they really didn't say what it was they gave her, I'm making that part up)and by the time they came to get her she was acting like she was really really drunk.  Silly and falling all over herself.  It was quite comical.  They took her to surgery in a wagon - which was a good idea.  She felt like she was getting to go on a fun trip - and she laid in it and waved goodbye like there was no problem about being wheeled off with strangers, stripped from her parents. It was then that I knew the medicine had kicked in fully.    We went to the waiting area and read magazines from 2001.  I had a nutritious breakfast of snickers and mountain dew - hoping the caffeine and sugar would keep me going since I had only had 4 hours of sleep (nervous mommies don't sleep well).  The doctor came out less than an hour later and told us all went well.  They had told us she would be awake in recovery and good to go home with no problems.  Even when they told me, I had my doubts.  She had tubes in her ears at 18 months and freaked out so much after the surgery (think helen keller) she ended up pissing off the doctor and nurses.  I think it is just the way the medicine affects her - she didn't even know who I was for awhile (that time or this time).  And she was not awake or coherent.  She was flailing and disoriented.  She was so worked up they gave her morphine (I think) in her iv.  I ended up having to crawl up in the recovery bed with her and laying down - she put her arms around me like I was a life preserver in the ocean...when she started waking up she screamed "I don't like it here! Get me out of here! I want to go home.right.now!!"    Anyway.  I could go on, but I'm so tired.  We eventually made it home.  She is ok.  Eating lots of popsicles.  She is napping right now.  I guess her sleep schedule will be out of whack for awhile.  Bf is here to watch her for the week - right now he is at the grocery store buying our groceries.  Hey.  Just watched a sony digital camera commercial with Steven Tyler in it.  Gotta love that.  That's all I need to know to buy the product. :)  I really thought Molly might die.  I know it was a routine surgery, but accidents happen.  Scapels slip.  I've known people (ok, only in the most peripheral way) who died from this exact surgery.  I couldn't bear it if something happened to her.  Thank god she is ok.  Thanks for your thoughts and prayers.  I wish it was the end of the journey, but it is only part of it.  Her eardrum burst last year and the hole that remained was so big, it isn't healing itself (which is what normally happens).  So they will have to do surgery to put a graft on it - and this first surgery was to increase the success rate of that surgery - plus her tonsils were extremely large.  2 out of 3 ENT doctors who saw her (and every pediatrician) recommended that they come out  - even without the ear problem.  I need to go cook dinner.  Since bf is here that means an effort that doesn't include macaroni and cheese or hot dogs.  This will be a challenge....  kim

      The title is only because that song has been in my head this evening for some reason.  I wish I was more creative and clever with the titles, but as you remember: I'm an accountant.  These are not qualities that are sought or admired. :)  I was thinking tonight about my hda friend.  When we used to talk he would talk about his marriage - and that they had decided to keep working at their marriage and they had decided they just needed to accept each other, warts and all.  The imagery is ugly enough there.  Burn those bad boys off I say.  But I was thinking on that tonight.  And I think they are looking at that as the glue that will hold their marriage together.  But without a foundation of love, how can you possibly accept someone warts and all?  Think about it.  How willing are you to accept the negative qualities of people you don't like?  When you love them, it might annoy you, but a part of you feels almost indulgent - like, well.  That is who they are.  I love them.  Am I too idealistic here?  Even with the failings of my relationship with bf, I never feel like I have to accept him "warts and all."  He has qualities and habits that annoy me, but unless I'm ragging, I just shrug and feel like, it's his way.  All part of the package that makes him who he is.  No big deal.  But when those thing become a big deal - when every little thing they do annoys the shit out of you.  Doesn't it give you pause?  Don't you think: perhaps I don't love this person anymore.  I don't even like them very much?  Marriage isn't a friendship.  I understand you don't throw in the towel - but if you've been in marriage counseling for 10 out of 15 years of marriage.  Well.  It isn't like you would be tossing that towel in early.  But there are kids.  There is shared history.  There is the unknown.    Not sure I have a point.  Just rambling about what is on my mind.  Mostly I'm thinking time to cut off my fingernails.  I keep them short - I'm on the computer and calculator all day.  The nails just get in my way.  So the blasted things grow like weeds.  They are flimsy, useless nails for the most part.  If I let them grow, they will curve down towards my finger.  Like a limp noodle.  Or limp something.    Did I tell you I met hda's mom the other night?  She was nice.  He talks about his mom a lot and I wondered if she might be one of those moms who insists on being involved in their son's life even if they aren't wanted.  I'm not making sense, but I know what I mean.  Pushy, rude, a little weird.  She may be those things - but that isn't the vibe I got.  She was very nice, laid-back, good sense of humor.  Relaxed and confident but not arrogant.  My sister is in Jordan.  Did I tell you that?  I've been blogging instead of emailing and she misses my emails.  Everybody give b. a nice wave.  She and her husband (who is from Jordan) are there visiting relatives - showing off their little boy.  He'll be three in October.  It is 104 degrees without air conditioning.  I would have already left my husband, walked a hundred miles to the airport and flown home.  Goldilocks don't play that game.    Financials are done and the numbers look good.  It made my boss so happy.  It'll make the doctors happy too.  I just think it is a little funny - it makes them like me more.  And I am the messenger, classifying what they've earned and spent, but when the numbers are good, they like me more.  So I hope they keep looking good.  My boss was still a bit testy about getting lectured by hda on Friday.  I tried to put a good spin on it for him and it seemed to help.  I could tell he stewed about it all weekend.    I should go to bed.  I was going to tell a few more work stories - but I'm sure I'd be able to get in a few more hda comments.  I know.  It is irritating.  But it is there and I am going to talk about it until I'm over it.  He wrote twice today - let me know he got rid of his Porsche. WTF?  So I wrote back and let him know I didn't love him anymore.  Of course I'm kidding.  But I was disappointed.  He had a yellow boxster.  Now he drives a damned expedition.  Freakin' Ford.  Yeah.  *THAT'S* sexy.  I know they are expensive, but it wasn't about the money.  I just thought the boxster was cool.    Argh.  going to bed...  kim

      Today has been a major cleaning day here in the kim household.  My four year old decided we *had* to be having company beause I wouldn't clean like this for no reason.  It's amazing how much dirtier a house gets with kids.  The stairs - how can so much crap end up on the stairs?  We don't eat there - the girls rarely even have their shoes on by the time they go upstairs - and yet when I vacuumed them, each step had stuff on it.  And being at that level on the stairs I noticed the walls were all dirty - which does make more sense.  They have their hands on the wall all the way up and down - so whatever is on their hands at any given moment, is on the wall.  Ugh.  It took me awhile to learn to clean at toddler eye level.  It just didn't occur to me for awhile, but if you sit on the floor and look at things - you see things that need cleaning that would never need cleaning in a childless environment.  I even steam cleaned the carpet in the living room...it is a cheap little bissel I have - not fantastic - but it looks a lot better.  I still have to clean the floor in the kitchen - I never mop.  I'm not very good at it, so I just get some 409 and papertowels and crawl around cleaning it.  It gets the job done.  A boring way to spend the day but at least I feel like I accomplished something.  I kept the computer online so I could take breaks - and my daughter fussed at me everytime I sat down "is the house clean?" "mommy, you aren't done cleaning, why are you on the computer?"  I did give the girls little tasks to do.  They enjoy that sort of thing right now.    Molly's surgery is Wednesday morning at 8:30am.  We have to be there at 7am and the surgery is supposed to take an hour and 1/2.  Not sure how long she has to be in recovery.  I've been trying not to think about it.  My mom was supposed to come down and stay with Molly the week after (she can't go back to daycare for a week) the surgery...but the last time I talked to her she thought she wouldn't be here until the weekend.  My bf (Molly's daddy) is supposed to come back into town on Tuesday and said he'll watch her.  He often promises to be there for things like this, but work usually intervenes.  I have no faith in him to help - so I may be out of work for 3 days next week.  Which is fine in some ways, but I'm still new and hate to take so many days off in a row.  Maybe bf won't let me down.    Time to go stand in the kitchen and wait for dinner inspiration to hit me.

      I've seen several sites where people have a list of 100 things about themselves.  I've wondered if this is a based on a list of questions I haven't seen or just a random list by each person who has done it.  It is like watching people dance when you are young and worried about not being 'with it.' (see: i'm so unwith it i don't even know the right phrase anymore for being cool.)  You watch people gyrate and think: do they all know the moves or are they just dancing with the music the way they feel like?  If I ask, then they'll know I don't know.  Damn.  I just won't dance. :)  I got over that, but I remember thinking that when I was younger.  And of course drinking always helps any dancing inhibitions.  I think I'm the dancing queen after a long island iced tea.  Where was I?  Oh.  List of 100 things.  I'm not sure I could come up with 100...but I'll try.  1. I'm 38 years old, but recently was asked if I was 21 (a man handing out cards for a free alcoholic beverage).  I don't think a normal person would think I was that young, but I could probably pull off 31.   2. I love to sing.  I sing at the top of my voice while I drive and it makes me happy. 3. I overanalyze nearly everything that happens to me. 4. I'm impatient. 5. I've lived in 9 states since I was born. 6. I went to 12 different school between kindergarten and 12th grade. 7. I'm 1/2 inch over five feet tall, but for years I thought I was 5'1 1/2" and so I would round it up to 5'2" - oops. 8. For the last 10 years my drivers license has said I'm 5'7" (a typo I caught after it was done and they said it would cost me $10 for them to fix it and I never did) 9. I don't like cartoons. 10. I hate clowns. 11. I think pancakes are nasty. 12. Brownies and sex are things I never want to live without. 13. I think a sandwich isn't complete without miracle whip. 14. I was once told if you aren't going to swallow, don't do it at all, so I've swallowed every single time. 15. I hate roaches. 16. I love Monk. 17. I have strawberry blonde hair, freckles and blue eyes. 18. I've never been fired. 19. I criticize all the time. 20. I complain a lot. 21. People think I'm funny. 22. I never wear any jewelry except for earrings. 23. I don't wear a watch. 24. I was a daddy's girl. 25. When I was 7, I was in love with BJ Thomas. 26. I think Kyle Petty is a hottie. 27. I love to listen to Neil Diamond. 28. Slow Dancin' Swayin' to the Music is the sexiest song to me 29. My dad was in the Navy band 30. My daughters have only met their grandmother (my mom) even though all of their grandparents are alive (and one great-grandmother) 31. I always wished I had an older brother. 32. I loved being pregnant because I went nearly 6 months without getting a headache and I could eat things that normally gave me a headache (i.e. hershey's chocolate) 33. I had gestational diabetes during both pregnancies and am considered high risk to develop diabetes now so I don't eat a lot of sugar/starches now 34. One of my pet peeves is when people let the garbage can get so full, it is overflowing - TAKE OUT THE DAMNED TRASH ALREADY 35. I don't mind doing laundry, hate folding and putting away clothes 36. I'm very good at reading people 37. I love to watch Matlock, Murder she Wrote and Magnum, PI 38. Roses are my favorite flower and I never get tired of the way they smell 39. I'm lazy with my hair 40. I keep my toenails painted red 41. I drive a 2001 Altima 42. I love going to bed right after a shower, just shaved legs into a bed with fresh sheets 43. I'm a terrible athlete and made a fine art form of avoiding p.e. since I was in 4th grade. My sophomore year in high school I managed to avoid playing a single game of volleyball.  I hate that game. 44. I can quote dialogue from 3 Star Trek movies (Wrath of Khan, Search for Spock, Voyage Home) and it irritates the crap out of my boyfriend and hda finds it entertaining 45. I've always wished I had a home with a window seat - where I could curl up and read books, undisturbed 46. I don't like being hot or cold 47. I love party mix 48. I love vegetables and dip 49. I've been told I have trouble letting things go once I have them in my head 50. I'm a fairly good speller 51. I only wear underwear from Victoria's Secret 52. I love to slow dance (I love to dance period, but slow dancing with the right person...that is great) 53. I like Air Supply 54. I don't understand the Paris Hilton pheonomenon 55. I still use my old Jane Fonda workout video from 1984 56. I always had a crush on Dr. McCoy, but Kirk is the one I would have slept with (I mean, who didn't?!) 57. Spock was too cranky for my taste 58. I miss Ally McBeal 59. I make really good peanut butter cookies (maybe I'll post the recipe, it's great) 60. I love to travel 61. I always think I'm right about everything and it annoys my family that I usually am (heh heh heh) 62. My daughters and I like to dance to Get Jiggy with it 63. My girls watch too much tv 64. My house is never as clean as it should be 65. I've never shot a gun 66. I can be really picky about what I eat 67. The unknown stresses me out 68. I'd rather have hurt feelings than no feelings at all 69. I love the beach in the fall 70. Red is my favorite color 71. I got the best actress award for a play in high school 72. I was too shy to pursue drama in college, but I love acting 73. I hate pain, even in a playful way - get really pissed if someone hits me for any reason 74. Not that anyone has ever hit me in anything but a playful way, but even then, I get unreasonably mad 75. I get more headaches than most people 76. I've had many doctors and nurses dismiss my health problems with the phrase "that is common among redheads" as if being born with red hair was a malady in itself (I'm not kidding about this) 77. I like taking pictures 78. I love taking my girls to the zoo 79. I usually drive the car when I'm with a group of people going somewhere - I've been told I have a control problem - all I know is I trust my own driving 80. I hate debating and arguing and will usually smile and nod and never give my real opinion 81. I'm good at getting along with people I can't stand 82. I'm very organized 83. Disorganization gets on my nerves 84. I hate it when people tell jokes  85. I love witty remarks and sarcastic comments 86. I think too many people take themselves too seriously 87. I have 3 sisters, but am only close with one of them 88. I let people take advantage of me and later resent it even though I knew they were doing it at the time 89. I'm not an outdoorsy person 90. I like the french country (toile) look even though I haven't decorated that way myself 91. I collect giraffe things 92. Once when I was at the zoo I saw the giraffes mating OH MY GOD 93. For some reason that line "stay with your wingman" rings in my head and I have no idea why 94. I've always wanted to kiss Kevin Bacon 95. I don't mind being short but think sometimes people don't take me very seriously (but being underestimated has its advantages) 96. I love Raggedy Ann 97. It makes me smile when someone makes a comment on my blog 98. I use the f-word more than a polite person should 99. I always takes showers, never baths 100. I like talking about myself.

      I know it's an old movie, but remember how Dustin Hoffman is trying to cook french toast at the beginning for his son and he totally screws it up?  At the end of the movie he is cooking it again and does it right.  I really like that.  I always feel like my parenting/cooking skills are stuck at the beginning of that movie.  I don't know how to make french toast or pancakes.  It took me a year to figure out how to scramble eggs that were worth eating.  I can finally make grits (it's a southern thing) but bacon is still another thing.  I've always like to think of myself as somewhat of an enjoli (sp?) woman (i can bring home the bacon, fry it up in a pan and never never never let you forget you're the man 'cause i'm a woman, enjoli)....except that I can bring home the bacon and never let you forget you're a man but I can't fry it worth shit.  What's worse is that my mom has always been of the feeling bacon can't be eaten unless it is thoroughly cooked - crispy from end to end (I've yet to do this without burning it).  But my four-year-old got hooked on "squishy bacon" after a trip last year to Shoney's.  So now I try to cook it where it is thoroughly cooked and squishy at the same time.  This morning I just simply prayed she wouldn't die from botulism (or whatever happens when you eat food that isn't cooked enough).  She ate it.  And I did manage to get the meal cooked with everything still warm (I used to have a major problem with most of the food being cold because I didn't cook it in the right order.)  Pancakes and french toast are still a mystery.  I like french toast but cannot stand pancakes - even the smell makes me feel sick.  But my girls eat them at school and like them.  I keep thinking I should learn to make them.  I did once and I got leathery disks that had to be tossed.  Then I tried the kind you warm up in the microwave.  They didn't like that.  So now the only time we have them is when my mom is visiting.  My mom is a great cook.  I used to think I was a great cook when I didn't have kids - I guess because I rarely cooked for myself.  So when I cooked for company or a pot-luck or whatever, I would whip out one of my dishes that I'm really good at.  However, being able to cook 3 meals doesn't mean you are a great cook - and it does mean you totally suck as a mom.  They eat breakfast and lunch at school - thank god really that someone is meeting their nutritional needs - and every night I stand in the kitchen wondering what I could possibly fix.  That's the thing.  My mind is always a blank.  I can make spaghetti, taco salad and hot dogs.  Ok, a few more things, but those are the ones my girls are most likely to eat.  I've had friends and family send me lists of meals (that I always lose) and I have lots of cookbooks.  But when you come home late and are tired and cranky and have tired and cranky kids...opening a cookbook and figuring out a new meal isn't what I want to do.  And I have tried it a few times - I have a couple of them that are "meals for kids" and they won't even taste them.  Talk about making mommy mad!  So then I just feel like: fine, we'll eat the same damn thing every 3 days.  I alternate with ordering pizza and going thru the drive-thru at McDonalds.  Yes.  I know.  They'll turn out to look like the trailer-trash at Wal-Mart if I don't mend my ways.  It's on my list of parenting things to master: find nutritious meals they actually like and I can fix quickly.  I'm just not there yet.

      I haven't told you what's going on because I sense you wouldn't approve.  Nothing has happened, really.  But hda sent me about 15 emails last week, offered to give me his Nordictrack and invited me to a gig (his word) he was playing at.  Yes, he's a doctor by day, musician by night (at least every now and then).  On the Nordic he told me to swing by his house and he'd put it in the trunk of my car - well.  I would love to go to his house, but given his wife doesn't even want us emailing, if I showed up at their house she might run over me.  I'm fairly uninterested in being run over.  So I passed on that option.  Now he's supposed to put it in his Expedition and transfer it to my car at some point (was supposed to be yesterday but he didn't bring it with him to our weekly meeting).  I took the girls with me to the gig (it was a place ok for kids) and we went to hear him play last night.  I really enjoyed it.  He sat with us during their break - but it was all surface chat.  He's said nothing to indicate anything is up or he wants anything.  I'm not sure how to take it, but I'm enjoying it.  I've filled my bf in on the friendship that was and the latest happenings.  (he's out of town again)  He called me while I was at the gig - I felt like he was a dog peeing around the yard - marking his territory.  As if hda had any clue I got a phone call and/or who called me.  It annoyed me so I turned off my phone.  And bf told me not to worry about picking up the nordictrack - he will go by hda's house and pick it up for me.  Well.  Isn't that thoughtful.  He says he is ok with the friendship but he really isn't.  That's fine, but I'm not likely to let him intervene in any way.  What's funny is I think hda offered up the nordictrack because my bf brought me a piece of exercise equipment last weekend.  I wanted a treadmill - instead he brought over what seems to be called a fitness flyer by guthy-renker (you know, fitness experts: or is it ginsu knives experts??).  I'm sure you've seen it on an infomercial - Tony Little or something like that - the legs go back and forth as if you are walking briskly and your arms are also going back and forth.  My bf sounded like he was selling the damn thing "it is better than a treadmill - it works out your arms and legs at the same time."  I can tell you this: I can talk while I do it and never break out into a sweat.  What this says to me it was made for people with more money than sense who want to think they are working out but aren't really.  My bf thinks I just need to give it a chance.  I just want a damn treadmill.  I used to run, but now I can't - I can't leave the girls home alone and really I'm too much of a wimp to go out in the heat to do it anyway.  If I had a treadmill it would be the best of all possible worlds.  I don't know what the nordictrack is - they make different kinds of equipment.  I hope it isn't the one that is like a ski machine.  Ugh.  It isn't a treadmill, I do know that.  But hey.  It's free and it will at least be a real workout, so I'm anxious to get it.  The other thing that was funny to me - hda commented that Molly was big for her age and I said "well, bf is 6 feet tall" and he said "well, I'm nearly 6 feet tall."  Like all of a sudden it was a contest or something like he wasn't going to be one-upped because bf was taller than he was.  I don't know.  I really don't know why he got weird and told me how tall he was.  I didn't see how it was relevant to the conversation.  I was just trying to point out why she might be taller than average for her age.  Certainly she didn't inherit that from my 5 foot tall frame.    Anyway.  Nothing is really happening, but it seems as if the moratorium on the emails has been lifted for now.    Oh.  One other weird thing.  At our meeting Friday hda sort of dressed down my boss - right in front of me.  I could tell my boss was embarrassed and when the meeting was over he high-tailed it for the elevator.  Which was fine to me - I was happy to linger and talk to hda alone.  Normally he would have waited for me and we would have left together. I knew he was upset by the little lecture.  It was unlike hda to do something like that, so I wondered why it happened.

      I guess they are having growing pains - but it seems to take forever for my posts to show up online.    I have tons of work to get done in the next day and 1/2 so I shouldn't even be here.  But.  Another email from hda this morning.  He's written every day this week.  And most of them have not been work related.  Nothing inappropriate, just friendly emails.  It just seems like there has been a shift back to our old email friendship even though he hasn't said that.  I'm afraid to clarify because I don't want the answer to be what I don't want to hear.  I'm enjoying it but trying to just take it for what it is - just basic, friendly email.  The thing is this.  He has no doubts about how I feel about him.  I've been very open about that.  It just seems like if he really wanted me to go away ignoring me is the best route.  One of his emails this week he said something about how much he enjoyed it when I used lines from movies in my emails - he said: "I know exactly what you are thinking."  Then he made one of his own that I totally didn't get.  I mean - I know what movie it is from and where, but not if it had any meaning.  When I use movie lines they are in context of my email, they help me make my point.  They aren't just random lines.  This is what he said: "Just remember, 'X never EVER marks the spot!'"  Which is from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade - and Jones says this to his class he is teaching, but when he is looking for something (diary? i can't remember) in a library on his adventure, he finds it under "x."  At any rate, I have no idea what, if anything, hda meant by that line.  It wouldn't help me to ask him, he wouldn't explain himself.  He never does.  But because I like to be tacky I replied "given your knowledge of female anatomy, you don't need markers to find the spot." (heh heh heh)  He never comments when I say tacky things like this.  It entertains me because he isn't the kind of person anyone would ever say that to.  So.  Financials.  I must get back to work.

      I have nothing mapped out here to talk about.  Hmmm.  Ok. Maybe how I got from a BA in Psych to an MBA in Accounting.  That's boring enough.  I started out as an elementary education major - at least this is what I picked out before starting college - the summer between my senior year of high school and freshman year of college I worked at a hospital in the accounting department.  I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Combined with the fact that I don't much like kids, hate teaching and public speaking - changing majors seemed be the thing to do.  So I went around rearranging my schedule the first week and changed my major to accounting.  But accounting was boring and I never studied or really even grasped it the whole semester - I got a B which still amazes me.  I decided Psychology was much more interesting.  And, well, at least to me - a very easy major.  Not that I was shooting for easy, but when you never study or make an effort to do well, the key to keeping your gpa up is making sure you avoid "human anatomy and physiology" and take "motivation" and "social psychology."  I did think it was interesting.  In what proved to be a key decision for my future - I dropped my 2nd year spanish class because it required making speeches in spanish (and having them videotaped).  I found this horrifying.  I had to have 2 semesters of 2nd year spanish - so I took them correspondence with IUPUI (Indiana University).  If you aren't good with spanish - taking it this way is not the easy road.  It seems like you could cheat your way through.  And I did on the homework, but the tests are proctored and there is no cheating there.  So I flunked.  Took it again.  Flunked again.  Seriously - I've never flunked anything in my life.  3rd time around I got a B.  Then I had to take the next class the same way.  It took me almost 18 months to get those 2 classes taken and passed.  I didn't get my degree until it was done.  Really stupid.  But because of that lingering requirement I didn't opt to pursue a Master's degree right away.  I got a job.  A receptionist job.  Sometime I'll blog about this nightmare.  I was living north of Chicago at that time and working in Northbrook.  Nice area.    My mom was having a rough time and I hated my job, hated who I lived with and decided to quit and move to Mississippi with my mom and younger sisters.  They helped me buckle down and get the Spanish done.  I took a job there as an administrative assistant in a construction company.  I learned a lot there - the job was low key and I had a lot of time on my hands.  I taught myself how to use the word processing and Lotus 1-2-3 (this was 1989).  Eventually my mom remarried the asshole, they moved north and I moved southeast.  I found a job in my new city within a week, so I took it as a sign to stay.  This time I was doing accounts payable for a very large construction company.  I worked there for 7 years.  Looking back that seems ridiculous, but there it is.  During that time I started back to school - first just taking the basic accounting classes and then moving to the upper level ones.  I finally talked to an advisor at the local university and he said a second bachelors wasn't the way to go - told me to get a master's in accounting.  So I was on that path for awhile.  The local university at that time didn't really work well with working adults pursuing a degree.  There were classes they only offered once a year - but you had to have before you could take the next, etc.  A real pain.  The job I had when I started let me take classes at lunch even though I was gone for nearly 2 hours.    During that time I switched jobs - a full charge bookkeeper/accountant (that was my title even though when i took the job i didn't have an accounting degree) for a home builder.  It was a much better job and I learned a tremendous amount.  The people I worked for were insane, but that is another story.  They didn't think education was important (none of them had degrees) and refused to let me take classes at lunch or even leave 1/2 early to take night classes.  This made things even harder - I was already on the 10 year plan!  I found out I was pregnant during this time and I was always throwing up - never felt good enough to study, so I dropped out.  I didn't have any support group or family around and I didn't feel comfortable with the idea of leaving her with a babysitter so I could take classes.  It seemed cruel to leave her in daycare 9 hours a day and then hand her over to a babysitter.  So I didn't go back to school.  Then I was watching "60 Minutes" and they profiled University of Phoenix online.  Accredited program all online.  I called them the next day.  I filled out the paperwork, applications, etc. and was enrolled in short order.  As I knew from my correspondence school days, taking classes online didn't mean they would be easier.  Far from it.  The classes I took were as hard or harder than any of the ones I took at the local university.  The only difference was most of the classes didn't have tests - it was all homework, papers to write (and papers and research and papers and did i mention we wrote a lot of papers?) and presentations (powerpoint).  Given my terror with public speaking this allowed me to stay in my comfort zone (not necessarily a good thing).    For the first year during nearly every class I wanted to quit.  They market the program as if you do it in your free time.  That only means if all your time away from work is free.  And every class has team projects - so you have to meet online with teammembers and that takes a lot of time (plus your grade was usually 30% bases on the teamwork, so if you had a sucky team, you were screwed).  I basically had no life.  Work, Molly, school.    I did manage to get myself knocked up again during this time.  My sister and brother-in-law and mom had moved in (long story) and really: thank god.  When Jackie was born I don't know how I would have ever made it through those first few classes and taken care of a newborn and 2 year old by myself.    So 2 years and 2 months later, I got my MBA in accounting.  I knew there was no way I would make the money I was making - or even have the ability to demand it in a new job - with a degree in psychology and my experience alone.  I needed the degree to validate that I was capable of handling a certain level and demanding a salary to match it.  However - where I live - good money is hard to find.    When the company I had been working for moved to Nashville, I went with them (because i had just finished my mba and my job hunting only netted jobs that paid LESS than i was making already!).  This was last year.  The year from hell.  Hate is not a big enough word.  It is late and I still have plenty to meanderingly (??this isn't a word) babble about, but I should go to bed.  Now I'm back 'home' to the place I've been since 1990.  I have a great job and the salary makes me happy.  My pursuit isn't about money itself - I just like making enough that I don't have to depend on someone else.  It gives me freedom.    And.  For the record.  My hda has emailed me 5 times this week.  I shouldn't be so happy about it, but today I was kristina and the waves all day. :)  kim

      Ok.  I'll confess.  I wrote hda last week 3 times and then totally lost it and wrote him one email each day of our three day weekend.  I know, Jay, I'm like your psycho ex-girlfriend and you shudder. :)  Well.  I didn't say anything psycho.  Let me rephrase that.  I didn't say anything I perceive as being psycho.  How does that sound?  I guess because he wrote me Friday night I felt like he opened that door.  But I told him I would retreat back to the "fun and friendly work banter" on Tuesday and quit with the personal stuff.  I feel the need to defend myself - but for a year he has been my online friend.  Imagine if someone took blogger away from you?  It would sound silly to someone not involved, but as some have said, blogging and reading blogs is like a crack addiction for them.  Well.  My emails to hda were my crack addiction.  So I had a relapse.  Can't normal people relapse?  Ok - don't go there with the he's-a-married-man speech.  That does not help and only pisses me off.  He never even said inappropriate (meaning sexual) things in his emails to me - he was just my friend.  That I have feelings for him does make it less appropriate of a friendship, but for all that, it never went there.  He was my friend and he knew everything about me.  I wrote him when I was happy and sad and bored and angry and when I wanted to tell a funny story or heard an interesting comment: I wrote him.  Whenever he wrote I had an Ally McBeal moment - I really loved that show most of the time (that last season was weird, but we'll not go there).  Anyway - you know how she was, theme song for her life in her head or some such thing.  I've said it before, but for me it was Walking on Sunshine, Kristina and the Waves.  That is a great song and I've always loved it.  He wrote, I was walking on sunshine.  Without him, I'm still walking - it just ain't sunshine.  It's not bad.  Really.  I'm ok.  But I'm blah.  Nothing seems as funny or as interesting or whatever.  It all just is.    Does Law & Order come on 24 hours a day or is it my imagination?  And have you ever noticed if you decide to give in and watch it - IT'LL BE ONE YOU'VE SEEN BEFORE?!  I hardly ever watch it and that happens to me.  Weird.  At least my headache is gone.  I should get some sleep.  Thanks for listening.  kim

      Crypto told me to write as if you know the background since I felt the need to write and didn't want to bother with having to set the stage.  I loved that advice.  I guess I'm past the need to write to you what I wish I was writing hda.  It never really worked anyway - what I wrote him was personal about me to him or my thoughts on whatever or him.  It just wouldn't make sense to anyone else and without him as the reader, I could never get the right thoughts out.    It is around 9pm, I'm sure the fireworks show will start soon.  I'm too far from downtown to see or hear it, but there are plenty of rednecks in the neighborhood shooting off whatever they bought to do at home.  Our family never did anything but sparklers so I always find it hard to believe that so many people really buy fireworks for home.    I've had a headache all day - me and these damn headaches.    Ok.  My dad was in the Navy when I was born and I have spent my life moving.  He was in the Navy band and the longest he was at sea was maybe 3 months, I think.  Played for heads of states in other countries - he used to bring me a doll from every country he visited.  I didn't mind the moving at the time, it was the only life I knew.  I remember being envious sometimes of people who lived in one house their whole lives, but I do think it has made me a more well-rounded person...however, probably more shy than I would have been otherwise.  I'm one of those quiet until you get to know me types and then I just won't shut up.  I think if I had been allowed to live in one place I would have bloomed - not that I withered, but I just think it made a difference.  He got out of the Navy for a little while and went to seminary to be a music minister in churches and he did that for a few years and then got back in the Navy.  I have 3 sisters, one older, two younger.  My parents divorced when I was 15 and my older sister and I lived with my dad.  My mom married an asshole and took my little sisters and moved 700 miles away.  They divorced, remarried and divorced again.  He is someone who should have been shot in the head early on in his life.  The only good thing I can say about him is he is dead now (and no, I had nothing to do with it).  When I was in college my dad remarried and his new wife was younger and didn't want him to have a previous family - so except for cards at holidays - it is like he doesn't exist.    My undergraduate degree is in Psychology and my MBA is in accounting - I just got that last year, I got the BA in 1988.  Took me awhile to get my shit together, I guess.    I've told you how my girls came into my life (surprise one and surprise two).  They've changed everything and I've been unable to get myself to a place that brings me back to church.  It was always a big part of my life - went to Christian schools most of my life, Christian college (for the BA) and until about 10 years ago, I was actively involved.  I didn't quit believing, but just quit wanting to be around the church.  Maybe because my lifestyle wasn't in line with my beliefs - too much cognitive dissonance.  I thought when the girls got old enough for church (I think they are now) I would find myself back there, but Sunday after Sunday I have no desire to go or try.    I've had a couple of people comment that I seem depressed.  I am, but not in a way that overwhelms me or my life.  I'm dealing with disappointment and the loss of a friendship and I think being sad about it is normal.  We aren't light switches - at least most of us aren't.  I've met a few guys who seemed to be able to turn on/off their emotions like a light switch.  Maybe women too - but I don't guess I've ever lost the friendship of a woman, so I can't relate personally there.  Well. Certainly I'm not still friends with everyone I've ever called friend - I just mean no big scene, I'm not your friend because of x-y-z.  Nothing like that.  Mostly just moving on in different directions - fading out.    I wasn't planning on blogging - I'm bored and with this headache am making no attempt to even be remotely lucid here - but blogger has been such a pain in the ass all weekend, it is too much work to keep trying to check in on my favorite blogs.    Oh.  My boss took my work blog project away from me - he gave it to our website people to do - for a pretty penny.  He's an asshole.  I told hda I was really pissed about it, but I didn't ask him to intervene.  Not sure why my boss took me out of the loop on it.  I had something that looked sharp, would have given them what they wanted and almost no cost involved.    For awhile I was feeling mildly attracted to my boss (and he is actually single, imagine that), but it is all gone now.  I think he is just messing with me by saying things that make me think he is attracted to me.  I've told you other things that made me wonder - last week he was saying how he liked redheads and pale skin.  I'm sitting there looking my normal ghostly white with redhair.  I just said "oh" in a voice that sounded like "i'll be on the lookout for someone who matches that description."  Like I said, I've decided he is just messing with me - maybe trying to get a reaction.  My daughter's surgery has been postponed a week - to the 14th.  She is taking an antibiotic and a steroid (to reduce swelling in the tonsils) right now.  I swear to God she's been taking it 3 days and I think she has already developed a case of 'roids rage.  She screamed at me today to the point of getting hysterical about something so minor that now I can't even remember.  It was comical and scary at the same time.    3 day weekends aren't much fun when you are alone with a 2 year old and 4 year old the whole time.  Boyfriend made a brief appearance today - 2 hours.  Not sure he'll have time to see us tomorrow.  This is normal for him, but the way he has sounded on the phone for the last 3 months, I expected him to be moving in.  He is still talking about it, but I don't think it is going to happen.  I don't even want to talk about him right now.  The only plus is that it is easier to break up with him since he's returned to doing and being what I didn't like before.  But still.  I was trying to love the one I was with and he is managing to make that impossible.    kim

      Rain rain go away, come again another day.  Like many parts of the country, it has been raining here alot lately. Daily.  The roses in my backyard like it, but I get tired of it and it gets mosquitos swarming.  Well.  I had one in the house yesterday so swarm might be exaggerating.  I've got crying, mess-making girls.  We need to get out of this house.  They love the beach but I'll only go first thing in the morning, otherwise it is too hot.  I only burn or add to the freckle collection.  At least the girls tan.  I guess it doesn't seem like a big deal unless you don't.    Oh.  Now they've moved on from crying to singing and putting on a show I'm supposed to be paying attention to.  Deep sigh. I must go...

      Wackiness: 30/100 Rationality: 24/100 Constructiveness: 26/100 Leadership: 36/100    You are an SEDF--Sober Emotional Destructive Follower. This makes you an evil genius. You are extremely focused and difficult to distract from your tasks. With luck, you have learned to channel your energies into improving your intellect, rather than destroying the weak and unsuspecting.  Your friends may find you remote and a hard nut to crack. Few of your peers know you very well--even those you have known a long time--because you have expert control of the face you put forth to the world. You prefer to observe, calculate, discern and decide. Your decisions are final, and your desire to be right is impenetrable.  You are not to be messed with. You may explode.

      Can you get pregnant if you have sex while you're ragging?  Is that just too disgusting to even ask?  I know I went on and on about not wanting to see my boyfriend and all, but when you haven't had sex for 3 months and someone is there who is ready, willing, able and wanting you - well.  It seems like a really great idea.  I assured him we didn't need protection since I was ragging.  Later I looked it up online and apparently it is possible, however unlikely.  I wonder if doing it twice makes it more likely.  At any rate, won't know that for awhile.  I know.  Jay specifically told us not to get anyone pregnant this weekend.  Maybe a loophole out is that I didn't get anyone else pregnant (or potentially, at least).  It was fun and if I am, I am.  I'll name her Lucy.  Right now I have a Molly and a Jackie (Jacqueline).  If I had four, I'd go with Sallie.  My boyfriend got a say with Jackie's name, but he was so far out of the loop with Molly, I barely consulted him on her name.  There are always positive sides to being single - don't have to really listen to other people tell you what to name your kids. :)  My mom called Jackie "Emma" the entire time I was pregnant and really a week after she was born.  Hda thought I should name her Maddy, which I like (was thinking it would be a cute nickname for Madeleine or Madison).    Speaking of hda.  I saw him Thursday at lunch.  Did I tell you for the first 45 minutes he wasn't wearing his wedding ring?  I was so excited, but couldn't ask him about it in front of my boss (kept hoping he (my boss) would need to pee, but his damn bladder must be able to hold 100 gallons).  Then out of the blue he put it on.  I was so irritated - mostly at myself for even noticing or hoping it meant anything.  He was wearing scrubs, so he had probably been doing surgery and didn't wear it then and had neglected to put it back on.  Dammit.  Oh well.  I wrote hda a long email yesterday, 90% of which was work related.  All things he needed to know, so I wasn't reaching to send it, mostly.  I did include a paragraph that was way too personal, but oh well.  The thing is, he wrote me back last night.  He hasn't written me an email from home since the end of May.  I was really surprised.  I don't know that it means anything, but it was interesting and has put me in a good mood.  Perhaps my mood should not be related to something like that, but it is.  My boyfriend was here and knows I got an email from him.  Naturally he was very curious about it, so I told him all about it - leaving out the paragraph of personal stuff.  No need to get into such extreme details, right?  But the boyfriend is gone already, back to his house.  I should explain that situation more, but I don't feel like it right now.  The girls loved having him here - however - if he is ever going to live with us, I'll have to get a king sized bed.  Three can sleep in the queen sized I have, but four doesn't work.  Jackie (the two year old) generally doesn't crawl in bed with us until about 4 or 5am, so it isn't a huge problem.  Molly, the four year old, won't sleep alone.  I had her occupied with a Scooby Doo movie and a snack (I thought) while bf and I were getting busy and she busted in, yelling "DON'T CLOSE THE DOOR, I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN THE DOOR IS CLOSED!" and marched back to her room.  I know she had to know bf was on top of me, we did have the covers on us, so she didn't get too much of a show, but all the same... she will ask me about it later.  She never lets anything slide.  She just waits until a better moment to ask.  I really don't want to discuss sex with her at four, but I don't like lying to her.  She never forgets anything.  She makes reference to things that happened when she was 18 months old...I'm not kidding.  The house is a mess.  I let it go for 2 days and it is like I've never cleaned it.  I can completely relate to Pin's stories - and where is he, by the way??  This morning when I went outside to tell bf goodbye (2 minutes maybe) I came back inside and Jackie had taken her cereal bowl to the couch and dumped it out (it was an accident, but still).  Frosted flakes and milk everywhere.  Disgusting.  And she is being potty trained and loves to be naked.  She is better than she used to be - normally makes it to the bathroom, but sometimes.  Well.  At least it is only pee.  Sometimes being anal retentive is a good thing.  That girl...she will not take a dump until her little butt cannot possibly hold it in another second.  She could crack walnuts with her ass, I'm sure.  I don't know how she does it.  I feel like I'm coaching someone having a baby trying to get her to go - "push, that's it, honey, push, you're almost there..." ugh.  Molly never had a problem with that - I could set my watch by it, she is so regular and normal.  I guess Jackie's problem isn't unusual - the pediatricians have acted like it isn't...but ugh.  It is disgusting.    It certainly helps to be back online at home.  I can vent here and not get crazy berserk with loved ones.  I guess that is why bf made it his mission last night (besides the obvious) to get me back online.  He's tired of listening to my cranky ass.  Well.  I may have to post 50 times over the weekend to catch up, so bear with me. :)  kim

      I've been told I overreact.  It's true, but I still do it all the time.  I think it is a charming personality trait. ;)  At any rate, my boss did not have his weekly meeting yesterday with hda - he just needed him to sign some papers.  Today was the weekly meeting and we (yes, I said we) had lunch at a place downtown - on the water - by the boats.  We were there nearly 2 hours - always fun to have lunch with the bosses, no worries about how long you're gone. I was pleased to be included and decided I needed to let you know since I had gone off the deep end yesterday about it.

      Has anyone seen that commercial for beer where the girl comes over to a guy drinking beer and kisses him passionately - and the end of the commercial says something like the beer is so good people will want to lick it off your tongue?  If so, what beer is that?  No, not going to go buy it, just some silliness I have in mind.

      another copycat quiz from Dayli...my results:  The Priss  Deliberate   Brutal   Love   Dreamer  (DBLDf) Mature. Responsible. Aristocratic. Excuse me. The Priss. Prisses are the smartest of all female types. You're highly perceptive, and confident in your judgements. You'd take brutal honesty over superficiality any time--your friends always know where they stand with you. You're completely unfake. Don't tell me that's not a word. You're also excellent at redirecting internal negative energy. These facts indicate people are often intimidated by you. They also fall for you, hard. You have a distant, composed allure that many find irresistible. If only more of them lived up to your standards. You were probably the last among your friends to have sex. And the first to pretend that you're pregnant. LOL. Though you're inclined to use sex as weapon, at least it's not as one of mass destruction. You're choosier than most about your partners. A supportive relationship is what you're really after. Whether you know it or not, you need something steady &amp; long-term. And soothing.

      I'm watching "When Harry Met Sally" one of my favorites. Harry's friend annoys me but he has some good lines. I like this one: "I'm a writer, I know dialogue, and that's particularly harsh." while Harry is telling him how his wife is divorcing him.  Anyway. I rarely get to watch what I want on TV. Ok. I'm the adult, I can do what I want. I choose to let the girls watch their shows or have it off. If I didn't blog so much, I'd watch more TV. I think this is a better use of my time. An even better use might be cleaning house or studying for the CPA exam. But for now. Here I am. And I'm blogging and watching one of my favorite movies - my girls are asleep and hda might come by next week. Things are good and I'm happy.  I'm not sure if I can do Jackie's pregnancy story justice tonight. I'll try. I'm a little distracted. Having fantasies of having sex with hda in the kitchen, in the living room, in my room - in the hall. Yes, way too much time thinking on that possibility. I don't do it just because I find it so dang entertaining to think about - but it will eventually lead me to think about what might happen if I really do sleep with him. I'll mull over possible consequences and decide if they are ones I can live with or not. It is this sort of thinking that usually keeps me from doing things I shouldn't. But this time. I just cannot fathom not sleeping with him if he wants to. I just can't. I'd rather be sad and deal with crappy consequences than live with the "what-if" of turning him down or simply avoiding the situation...which would be what I would do. If I decided not to follow through, I would make sure my mom was here when he came over with the nordictrack (she'll be back to visit tomorrow) or I would tell him I'll wait until bf gets back and let him put it in his truck. There are certainly ways to avoid it without any awkwardness. But I don't want to avoid it. And really. I think this 'helpfulness' with the damn nordictrack is an excuse for him too. He wants to come over and it is the only reason he has. He knows he is welcome here. But he would never just invite himself or show up. This opens a door. We'll see if he manages to push through it. He may be the one to back out and find another way to get it to my house. Or do what he's been doing for the last 2 months. Bringing it up and then never mentioning it again for weeks. He's like a turtle. Sticks his head out, takes a few steps, then retreats again.  See. I'm not talking about Jackie at all. And that story. It involves another chapter I'm not sure I want to get into. But I was breaking up with bf to date someone new - and bf was trying desperately to keep me. So much so that we had sex twice without a condom. Only time we hadn't used protection since Molly was born. And yes. I got pregnant. What are the odds? First time takes 5 years and the second one takes 2 encounters? Oh brother. You can imagine the new guy in my life wasn't too impressed to find out I was pregnant. Really a date killer. I hadn't progressed far enough with the new guy to have a physical relationship going, but that guy. I was crazy about him. I thought he acted like a complete ass when he found out some truths he didn't know. In the long run he wasn't for me. But it took me a long time to get over him. I was working on my MBA during that pregnancy and really most of it is a blur to me now. I again had the gestational diabetes - and so, as with Molly, I had to see a high-risk specialist. I also saw my regular ob/gyn twice a week for fetal monitoring and then monthly for a checkup (more as it got closer). During that time. Well. I'm not sure I can tell you that yet. But the high risk doctor. I was not in love with him. Ugh. That man. But they had the coolest ultrasounds. That's the thing with both pregnancies - I had lots of ultrasounds. My ob/gyn did a couple of freebies and then the official one with his ultrasound tech (the one where they determine, or try to, if you want, if you're having a girl/boy)...and then with the high risk doctor it was a 3-D type.  One of my favorite stories is how I pissed off one of the nurses at my ob/gyn's office. They had moved to new offices since Molly was born and in their new office they didn't have a room (yet) dedicated for the fetal monitoring. My ob/gyn had this great recliner in his office and they would set me up in that. It was so comfortable. I loved it. Plus great fun to be in his office. One time my mom went with me and we were already in his office for some reason - maybe scheduling the breach flip deal (yes, Jackie was also breach the whole time) - I don't remember. I do remember it was time for me to get hooked up to the fetal monitor and the nurse acted like she was going to take me to another room. And I said, with horror, "I can't stay here and do it on the recliner?" big eyes at my ob/gyn. But I was mostly kidding, but my ob/gyn immediately nodded to the nurse to bring all the fetal monitoring equipment into his office and let me do it in the recliner. Oh my god was that nurse mad. But you know, she can't argue with the doctor. So she did it - but with such an attitude. She never liked me after that. My mom even commented on it. My ob/gyn either didn't notice or simply didn't care.  Oh - well. I did have troubles with Jackie even beyond the gestational diabetes. She had what they call a two-vessel cord. It is supposed to have three. It means it was possible she wasn't getting enough nutrition, etc. to be completely normal. I'm sure I'm not explaining it right, but it was an issue they noticed right off (because I was over 35 when I got pregnant, I saw the high risk doctor right away, so they caught this early on and watched it throughout - there isn't anything they can do about it, really).  During that time my mom lived with me as well as my sister (who was pregnant and had her baby 3 months before I had mine) and her husband...and Molly. I was glad (sometimes!) they were there because that MBA took all my time and it was great to have the help - especially after Jackie was born. My brother-in-law spent hours rocking and feeding her.  When I went to the hospital to have Jackie (again, planned) I had to be there at midnight. The nurses were disgusted with my doctor for that one (he just wants to make sure you have the baby before 5pm). He was going on vacation the next day - and he did want me to deliver before he left. The nurses told me he only did that for his special patients. I didn't know I was a special patient, so I enjoyed that tidbit. My bf was there this time (out of town the first time and we weren't really close during the first pregnancy - I know that sounds weird, but it's true - with Molly I was going through so much turmoil, I just kept him at a distance....didn't even consult with him on what I was naming her...I made up for it by letting him name Jackie). I don't even feel like talking about the epidural thing - but I said I would. It is just that they didn't send a doctor - I'm sure the woman was qualified, but she fucked up with me. The doctor I had with Molly didn't hurt me at all - I didn't feel anything and then all of sudden, I was going numb. This woman poked and prodded and it was killing me - and I'm not a wimp. But she kept yelling at me not to move and I'm HAVING FUCKING CONTRACTIONS and of course all my support team was eating lunch and I was alone. I couldn't move and I was crying and snot was falling out of my nose - so disgusting. My mom walked in and immediately picked up the phone and called my bf to get there right away. The stupid bitch (epidural woman) stuck me 3 times and stayed for 1/2 hour and finally decided she had done her thing and left. I never felt the least bit numb. The nurse knew something wasn't right...so she called and they sent a doctor. I loved that man...I don't think I ever even saw his face. I know he could tell from looking at my back that the other woman had fucked up. But he fixed it quickly and only took a minute to get things going and I was numb. I loved him. So my advice is - insist they send a real doctor. That's all I'm saying. So. There were all kinds of women having babies that day. Once again my doctor came at noon at stuck the knitting needle in and broke my water. I knew to request the epidural right away after that (see, I'm out of order on this story). He left and said "I have to go to XYZ and I won't be back until 5pm, so don't have that baby before I get back." And he left.  (oh, one funny to me: after he did that he was standing there talking to me and bf and the entire time he was talking to us he had his hand resting on my bare knee - i was transfixed by that - not sure bf even noticed)  The epidural was going (so was the pitocin) and things were slow. Boring and slow. But bf was there and it was ok. The nurses rarely checked on me - they were busy birthin' babies. Well. I kind of thought I was making progress but I didn't want to say anything to the nurses because I didn't want them to turn off the epidural (remember - like the first time). So I kept it to myself - and I knew they had the fetal monitor stats going at the nurses station, so theoretically they could see what I was seeing and should know things were picking up.   Eventually - seems like around 4:50 or 4:55 they came by to check on my progress.  The nurse picked up the sheet and put her fingers in there and said "push" and then OH MY GOD, DON'T PUSH, STOP PUSHING, DON'T MOVE, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.  And raced out of the room.  Bf and I looked at each other.  And waited.  My mom and sister were eating supper.  No way to reach them.  The nurse raced in with a woman and said "CAN SHE DELIVER YOUR BABY? YOU ARE ABOUT TO DELIVER, CAN SHE DO IT?"  and I indicated she could - I mean - what do I say? No?  There was lots of rushing around and all of sudden the nurse raced back in with my beloved ob/gyn.  She said, with an abnormal amount of relief in her voice "LOOK WHO I FOUND!" and she was so pleased for both of his that he was there to deliver my girl.  (I wondered later if they weren't just relieved for me, but knowing I was a 'special' patient he would be upset if he missed it.  No way for me to ever know, but it pleased me to think it mattered to him.)  So there was no time to move me to a delivery room - with Molly I was already in a room that was for both - labor and delivery - a nice big room with 2 love seats, recliners, tv, etc. so the family can all be there and be comfortable, but also with all the things needed for delivery of a baby.  This time I was in a closet of a room (all those other women birthing all day using up the good rooms) and no time to take me to an official delivery room.  Having the baby on the bed.  My ob/gyn was sitting at the end of the bed - someone handed my bf a flashlight (I'm not kidding) and ob/gyn asked him to shine it on my privates (i'm sure bf loved this, but as an electrician, lighting things up is what he does...).  My mom and sister walked in about this time, a room full of people now.  I told my sister "take some pictures, nothing nasty" and got to work.  Well. work.  There was no work.  Ob/gyn said "ok push" and then "one more time" and I was done.  No counting.  No coaching.  No breathing.  No faking them out with pretend pushes.  Just 2 pushes and out she came, no problem.  I guess she could have popped out on her own if they hadn't checked me in time - I don't know.  It worked out the way it was supposed to.  It amused my doctor greatly that he told me to have her at 5pm and I did.   Bf was stunned and amazed at how easy it all went.  He was prepared for a spectacle of screaming, crying, and nastiness lasting for hours.  He was so pleased at my birthing talent.  I think it is genetic and I had little to do with it.  But it was an easy birth, no doubt.  She looked nothing like Molly at birth and I wondered if I had popped out the wrong kid.  For some reason I expected her to look the same.  It amazes me still to think about how two people can make a baby and another (and so on) and they turn out different every time.    As far as her development related to the two-cord problem.  The first 6 months or so we weren't sure.  She was slow with motor coordination.  Her little cousin, only 3 months ahead of her could practically use tweezers he had so much hand/eye coordination and she flailed like a newborn for nearly 6 months.  But once she got to be a year old, she was fine.  She was on track with everything and now...not to brag, but she is the smartest 2 year old I know.  She talks in complete sentences - I read something the other day about how at her age she can put 2 or 3 words together, maybe recognize some colors, but it will be several months before she could use complex sentences.  It made me laugh - she's been talking in complete sentences - long sentences for several months already.  She knows her alphabet, can count to 13 and knows all her colors.  She's my little wizard.  No problems with her development. :)  (and all mommies say their kids are the smartest....I know...) :)  kim

      I'm an emotional person and with my hda since breaking the barriers of how I feel about him and how he makes me feel, I've never gone back. I share everything I'm thinking with him - much more than a normal person would share. He is just the opposite. He is uptight. Emotionless is harsh - he certainly doesn't come across that way. He seems laid back, full of humor. Always a joke for every situation or a personal anecdote that relates. As a doctor he puts patients at ease with his friendly, but not overly personal manner. Interested, but not intrusive. But I think he has mastered this so well, it is hard for him to really relate in a personal way with friends (his wife, etc.). There is friendly banter and conversation but nothing goes too deep. He has many casual friends, but only a couple of close friends. Over the past year he has shared a lot about himself with me and I probably know him better than just about anyone. It it the fact that he is open and shares so much with me that makes his wife jealous and feel threatened. Because it isn't the way he is, with anyone. I'm not sure why I got so lucky to be his friend - perhaps it was all just timing.  It has been the most exhilarating experience - being able to say anything and everything to him and he likes me anyway. Normally I'm too much. I write too often. Say too much. Eventually guys grow weary of me and annoyed and things crash and burn. With him there has been no line I couldn't cross - he never acted like I wrote too often or said things I shouldn't say. I like to figure things out and often analyze a situation based on the pieces of the puzzle I have. He seemed to enjoy the attention. I know I've missed emailing him and I have to believe he's missed my emails.  It was Memorial Day weekend when he told me his wife had asked him to give up my friendship. I've had bouts of doing fine with it and more often bouts of doing terrible with that.  Things seemed to be going better for awhile - he started writing again, nothing too personal, but not work related. He invited me to watch him play with his group. Then he went on vacation. When he got back we seemed to have returned to the Memorial Day exile. Not only no communication, but he nearly got me in trouble with blabbing at a board meetings things I had told him. I was so frustrated. Felt like I should accept the reality and truly let it go.  This past week I've been especially hormonal and I wrote him quite a few times - very personal emails of the nature I'm not supposed to send. He made no comments either way. Yesterday was our weekly meeting and I wasn't going to go. But. My boss said we'd go to the bar (haven't had the meeting at the bar since his wife told him to give me up - I figured she also put a kibosh on drinking with me at a bar, even if it was at a meeting with someone else there). I was so pleased. But later my boss said we didn't have time for that and would just meet him at his office.  I got there first and walked into his office - he looked happy to see me and not at all mad. I was surprised and pleased. He said "I've been trying to call boss and tell him we'd go to the bar today." I said (like a little kid), "can we still go?" And he said we could so when boss arrived we left and went there. Yay. When we got there they both ordered beer (Corona Extra if you must know) and I said "coke." Hda said "oh, you're really walking on the wild side today, aren't you." And I said "well, I was going to get rum and coke, but decided not to." He said, "get the rum and coke, drink coke chasers after that." Then nodded towards the bar for me to get the bartender and get it straight. I was amused - he's never insisted I drink before. Not sure what was up with that, but I didn't have a problem with it. I don't drink much so everytime I do I get loopy easily.  So we had our meeting. It was productive - I interjected mostly with names and numbers (I'm the detail person). It was interesting and I enjoyed it. Sitting across from hda I could watch him. He's grown a goatee and I love it. I love goatees. Love them. And for some reason with him I'm reminded of that Star Trek show where they have an incident in an ice storm and Kirk and others are thrown into a parallel universe - Spock has a goatee in it. His sexiest look ever. And I'd have to say the same for hda. Between the rum and the goatee....well. I would have done him under the table at the bar. :) ha So. It was getting late and I had to go get the girls. I was determined not to engineer a reason to talk to hda alone. (it is my way) So I stood up and he started babbling to me about that I needed to call him next week and I couldn't hear the rest of what he said. He was trying very hard not to get me to leave yet.  Boss had to leave too (he has a 6 year old). So hda and I talked for a minute - he said he wanted me to call him next Thursday evening (at home???) to remind him to put the Nordictrack in his SUV and he'd bring it to me. I looked at him when he said for me to call and he shrugged and said "or email." His wife also reads his emails, so I'm still not sure that is a good idea, but I'll address that next week. Not that it matters, he seems incapable of lying to her. Which is a good thing. But, you know. We walked outside and I didn't think it would fit in the trunk of my car so he went back and forth on that. Finally he said, "well, I'll just follow you home."  FOLLOW ME HOME? FOLLOW ME HOME? Oh my God. :)  I know my face flushed, it got very hot. I just nodded like of course that was ok with me and I said I had to go (I was already late, daycare closes at 6pm and I'm supposed to be charged for every minute I'm late). He looked at me for a second, said "thank you" and then "see you later alligator." (he always says that - now jackie says it all the time) And he walked off.  Follow me home. Follow me home. Follow me home.  Wow.  I did call boyfriend when I got home and told him an abbreviated version. I know I sounded too happy. He was instantly depressed (he is on his way to Utah for a month). I told him it was no big deal, that once hda sobered up he might change his mind. Bf was still upset - said he wasn't, but I could tell. I know he tries so hard to make me happy - and can tell that one thing from hda made me happier than anything he (bf) has done for me. I do feel bad about it. But now madly thinking of the possibilities if I get hda to my home. :)  kim

       Ok. I started today. No little Lucys or Wileys on their way. I was worried about it. And at 38 I know if I'm going to have another, I should do it soon. But I just didn't want it to be right now. You know what I kept thinking about? How can I get through 9 months of board meetings without drinking? ha Yes, that should be my biggest concern if I'm pregnant.  When I got pregnant with Molly it was a complete shock. I had been with bf for 5 years and never once used protection. My periods are irregular and my doctor said I would never get pregnant without 'help.' It would seem he was mistaken. I remember I kept having this horrible headache and I felt so bad one day I left work early and stopped by the store on the way home and got a pregnancy test. This sounds like I might have suspected. I did not. I had been doing that on and off for 5 years. Not sure why. They are pricey little things and I wasn't exactly in a position to waste the money. I felt so bad I just went to bed when I got home. Eventually I got up to go to the bathroom and I used the test. Unfortunately, it was a faulty test. I couldn't believe I had spent so much money (probably $15 - $20) on one that didn't work. I got the box and looked for the manufacturer's customer service number. Phone in hand and dialing....waiting for an answer. Then I thought: I feel so bad, I hate to get into it with an idiot customer service person - and there are two tests, so I'll use the other one. It was faulty too. That made sense, they probably came from the same batch. I was debating driving to a different store (maybe one with fresher products) but I felt really bad and got back in bed. I took the two tests with me - you know, the faulty ones that showed I was pregnant. I stared at them for the longest time. I finally called my sister (b.) and cried hysterically. She was at work and not really at liberty to be that comforting. My bf and I were sort of on the outs and I had told him not to come by that day after work - "just go home" I said in my most hateful voice. But even though the tests were likely faulty, I thought I should talk to him - so I called him and he came by. He sat down on the couch - I handed him the tests and burst into tears. He looked puzzled (no idea that the two lines were a positive result). Eventually he figured it out, tried to look supportive as the blood drained completely from his face.  I did end up buying another box of 2 tests -they came out positive as well. I still wasn't convinced, so I had my primary care doctor do a blood test. When that one came out positive I thought it must be the real deal... and made an appointment with my beloved ob/gyn. When I went to see him he seemed surprised at my pregnancy, but happy for me. I burst into tears. He handed me a tissue, when it got too wet, he took it from me and gave me a dry one. He said we would do a little ultrasound and see what we had going on (since I was so irregular, no way for me to know how pregnant I was). He took me to the ultrasound room and did the ultrasound himself - and found the little bouncing alien in my belly. I was transfixed. I didn't expect it to look like anything - I was barely pregnant, and yet - there it was a little round thing with a head and flaps for the arms and legs....and moving all around, dancing a jig. It was amazing. I cried some more, he seemed pleased for me - gave me the expected due date and printed out the pictures for me to take home. It was the moment I saw her dancing in my belly that I knew she was real. There was something in me that I had to take care of.  I wasn't really happy to be pregnant - unwed mother just wasn't the picture I had of myself. Bf and I were not at a point to get married and it never crossed my mind to push the matter. My boss at that time (an older lady) assured me that it was much better to be married and divorced than to have a baby without being married. What screwy logic.  I kept thinking hopefully that I would have a miscarriage. How horrible is that? I didn't do anything to trigger one - just the opposite. I took my vitamins, drank lots of water and did all the things I was supposed to do. When I developed gestational diabetes and had to inject myself twice a day with a shot of insulin, I did it. (hated it, but did it) But I was so afraid of the unknown of parenting that I secretly wished for a miscarriage.  She was breach (head's up) the whole time - and a week or so before she was due I had to go to the hospital and let my doctor flip her. This doesn't sound like a big deal, but it is horrible. He put his hands on both sides of the baby (they have a fetal monitor on you in case this stresses the baby, they'll know) and started turning. Imagine if you had, let's say, a 10 pound bag of potatoes in your belly and someone pushed down on them and tried to turn them. Or something. You know. Big and heavy and not easily turned. I was trying to be brave and strong and I thought I was going to manage to do it when a nurse raced in and needed a doctor right that minute. He let go and ran off. She flipped back, head's up. Damn. While he was gone the fetal monitor slipped and the dumbass nurse decided the baby might be in distress (in which case they would immediately do a c-section)...and to be on top of things she decided to start an IV in my hand - and in such a hurry that she didn't have time to even prick it with something to deaden the area. Just shoved this huge needle in my hand - while she was doing this my doctor came back and saw what she was doing - I could tell he thought it was unnecessary but she was determined and nearly done - when she stuck that damned needed in my hand it hurt like hell. I immediately started to cry - and my doctor held my hand. He is the nicest man I ever met. When she finished he had to start over - and this time it seemed to hurt even more. It was so awful and since I had already started crying over the hand torture, I couldn't help but cry over this as it really did hurt (i've learned that they now give an epidural before doing this, but i did au natural). The deed was done, no c-section, no baby distress - and she stayed face down. yay  The last time I went to see my doctor before her scheduled due date (with gestational diabetes they don't let you go past your due date - the baby can get too big) - I had been going twice a week for fetal monitoring. I was on the table, in this back room with the monitor strapped on, crying and crying and crying. I didn't want anyone to see me, but I couldn't stop. Eventually they did notice - and assumed I was afraid of the delivery. That part didn't scare me as much as the idea of having to take home a baby.  I had to go to the hospital at 8am and my mom and sister went with me. They started a drip to get things going (pitocin) and I watched TV and talked. I wasn't allowed to have anything but ice chips. When my doctor came by I complained to him how the nurses were ignoring me and he said "well, there are other women actually having babies right now" and there I sat watching TV. I don't think he thought I was in need of dire nursing help. So. Noon came and he wandered back to see me and broke my water. This means he took what looks like a big knitting needle and shoves it up inside the appropriate region. No big deal. EXCEPT. Well. No one told me that contractions actually hurt a helluva lot more when there isn't a cushion of water (or whatever it is) surrounding things. It gets uncomfortable. Annoying even. I think around 3:30 or so I decided I had had enough of that and told them to bring on the epidural. If you get a good doctor doing that, you're fine - you get their nurse practitioner person, you're screwed. (this pregnancy I got the doctor - we'll hear a different, more horrific tale when the next preggo story is told) Within a minute or two I started going numb from the waist down. I guess this makes sense, but in my head I was thinking it would only numb the affected areas....instead it was like I was paraplegic. My limbs were there, I could see them, but feel nothing. And suddenly, they looked huge.  When I finally started getting dialated enough they put my legs up - nurse on one side, my mom on the other. My sister took pictures. (my mom's idea - nothing more horrible really - not sure where they are now, hopefully we burned them) And the nurse. Well. She kept massaging - oh, what's the word? There's a word - anyway - the idea is to get it stretchy enough so that when the baby's head pops out, your skin doesn't tear. But the weirdest thing was - I could feel the sensation of her rubbing my privates - and it was a little tittalating. I kept thinking, what if I have an orgasm? That would be so inappropriate and awkward....and yet. Oh. I should move on with the story. So my good doctor shows up when things get close and sits down between my legs. I like it when he's there. hee They've been having me push and count. Seriously. I can't feel anything - so what I did was scrunch up in a ball as much as possible, wrinkle my face and push like I was going to the bathroom, but out of one eye I kind of squinted to see if anyone was buying this act. They were. More interesting still, it was working - the baby was coming!  It didn't take too long and push, push - out came a baby! (oh - note, they turned off the epidural when they thought I was getting close to having the baby WHAT THE HELL? they said so I could feel to push - I THOUGHT THE WHOLE POINT WAS SO I WOULDN'T FEEL PAIN AT THE MOMENT OF BIRTH AND YOU WANT ME TO FEEL SO I CAN PUSH? THAT IS SO MUCH CRAP.) When they put her on me, I thought "there's that little alien who's been dancing inside of me for 9 months..." It was the weirdest thing...it still is. You grow a little person inside of you - like an x-files moment - and they pop out and you don't know them. They are a stranger (sort of like meeting someone in person you've only known online). But a stranger you already love. But still: I need a coke - THAT MEANS STAT...and a hamburger. Anyone have something to eat around here? Put that little tyke in the nursery, can't you? :)  OH. And this is so horrible. They wanted me to get up and go to the bathroom. Not sure why...but I couldn't walk very good (still feeling the epidural). A very large black woman steered me to an industrial size toilet. And she stood there. The door open. I finally sat down and well. It was the kind of moment, let's say, if you worked on the 9th floor of a building, you might take the elevator to the 3rd floor and use their bathroom to do. Really not something you want a captive audience for. On the other hand, about 400 people had walked in and out of the room staring at my very most privates for about an hour, so...what's the big deal? THE WORST PART WAS, I COULDN'T SEEM TO WIPE MYSELF AND SHE HAD TO HELP ME. Ugh.  I really hated her for the first few days - she never stopped crying, I never got any sleep, my nipples were sore, cracked and bleeding from the torture of breastfeeding (that I never got the hang of and gave up on)...and when I took her back on the 4th day because she wouldn't stop crying (she had lost too much weight, wasn't getting enough to eat and I started her on formula then) I had to change her diaper and get her dressed while the pediatrician watched me. I felt like saying "here, you take this one, I'll do it next time." I had no clue how to do it and it seemed to take me an eternity. How unfit was I? It took me awhile to feel comfortable wiping her privates - isn't that funny? I kept thinking "ummm...I'm sorry, here, you take the wipie, I know that's a personal area there." I don't think a thing of it now, but then I felt very very weird about it. Just not something I was used to doing for anyone, any size. :)  Our first year together was very rough - she rarely stopped crying the whole year, spend a week in the hospital one time, emergency room 3 times and pediatrician's office at least once a month for something. I had no idea parenting was such a nightmare. It wasn't until my second daughter came along that I realized not every parent goes through what I did with Molly. She was high maintenance from birth. Jackie. Oh, my Jackie. She would sleep 23 hours out of 24. She was a dream baby. :)  It's late, I'm going to bed. kim

      Well.  So many things I've wanted to blog about lately, but now that I have a few minutes to blog, I'm tired and not sure I feel like getting into any of it with you.  I love this blogging community.  It really is nice to have it - there is consistency quite often when things in my real life aren't so consistent.  Even the commenters that annoy are nice to have because you know they'll be there.  Online blogging friends who show concern and compassion no matter where you are on your path in life.  Leese recently let me know if I needed to talk about some issues, she'd be happy to listen.  It is nice to have that outlet to spill things that I haven't spilled here.  Cathartic to get it all out.   Crypto touches base every now and then and manages to give me a nudge in the right direction without seeming to nudge at all.  AJ talked me off the ceiling this morning - and I laughed at myself.  (see....I got worked up because there was an IP on my blogpatrol that was in my same city and I was freaking out thinking I had given too much of myself away in the blog and that a local might figure out the real people behind my made up names...turns out I was freaking out OVER MY OWN IP. Ha.  Talk about being a ditz.  I had been using a dial-up when I switched computers because I couldn't get the dsl to work on my boyfriend's laptop (because I had accidentally installed two filters, but that is neither here nor there - that's a ditzy moment unrelated to this one)...so when my sister got the dsl working, it must have changed my IP address - and I had set blogpatrol to ignore my old one and didn't know I had a new one.  Can anyone even follow that?  All that to say, so far no locals have found me, but I might be doing some editing if I think it is necessary.  Last night I was thinking to delete the whole thing.  I can be irrational from time to time.)  I'm not sure why, but I tend to make things harder than they have to be.  My fridge started pee'ing on the kitchen floor last week.  My mom has told me what to do when this happens (there is really nothing she can't fix) and I couldn't remember (mostly because I've never listened, I think: boyfriend will fix it)...so I called her and she told me what to do.  So.  On Sunday I pulled out the fridge - and ugh.  I'm very sensitive to mold/mildew - major migraine trigger.  I put on the rubber glove things (you know, big yellow things for cleaning) and unscrewed some things and took off a tube and washed it out - this took me quite awhile because I'm rather inept with tools.  I was wishing I had a face mask, sure I inhaling vapors that would make me sick.  There was water all over the floor under the fridge and I confess that I threw the towels away that I cleaned it up with - sure that the washing machine would never get them clean enough.  Not OCD, just a little persnickity about such things.  So.  It took about an hour, I put it all back, all screwed back together (and cleaned while I was at it) and the fridge pee'd again, all over the floor.  I told my boyfriend and he said "call the landlord."  Who calls the landlord?  My mom always fixes everything....but I was tired of the water so today I put a note in the drop box on my way to work.  When I got home it was all fixed (ice maker had a leak or something) - of course my kitchen has black fibers covering it from end to end, the floor is nasty, but it is fixed.  No more fridge pee. All it took was a little note to the landlord and it was fixed...and I wasted so much time and energy on Sunday working on it - getting cranky at myself, my kids ("GET OUT OF THE KITCHEN, DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING, PUT DOWN THE PLIERS, GIVE ME THAT SCREW BACK, ACK, THAT'S NASTY, DON'T TOUCH IT"), my mom for not being here to fix it, my boyfriend for not being here to fix it.  Well. You get the idea.  I was overboard for no reason.  It's my way.  My boyfriend has been especially sweet lately - not sure why.  Over the weekend he got me a dozen red roses (did I already tell you that?) and yesterday he surprised me by cooking me a steak and baked potato and salad for lunch (I live close enough to work to drive home for lunch).  It is my favorite meal - but for lunch?  In the middle of the week?  For no reason?  Then after work he took me out for ice cream (Baskin-Robbins - chocolate fudge).  Oh - and he cleaned my house, cleaned my car, put away all my laundry, took my car for an oil change.  After 9 years of dating, he can still be so sweet.  I'm currently working on trying to love the one I'm with.  I do love him, just no passion.  Oh, well, we had sex twice yesterday (a girl's got to show some gratitude!) and I did manage to enjoy it without pretending I was with someone else.  That's a good thing.  No, he didn't pursue sex - it was my idea.  He did all those things just because he wanted to make me happy - he had no ulterior motive in mind.  He knows I'd have sex even if the house was messy and we ate tuna for lunch. :)   I've made myself a list of why I'm not happy and what I can do to get happy.  I know - pursuing happiness isn't the way to go.  It is a side effect or some such thing.  But there are things in my life that are dragging me down and for me I need to overcome them/fix them/etc. so I can really feel happy about the direction things are going.  None of these are boyfriend related.  Not sure if I feel like sharing my list, but just making the list has helped.  I've already accomplished several things - ok, the easy ones - but it's a start.  One of them is to get my CPA license.  I'm qualified to take it, but the last year has been one thing after another - and now I feel like it's been so long since I was taking classes I'll have to start over learning things.  I can do it, but it's a big task.  It's childish but mostly I want it to validate myself...I took so long getting a 'real' job that in my mind I'm always feeling inferior or something.  No one at my new job treats me like that, it is in my head.  A constant need to prove I'm worthy, smart enough to have the job I have.  And it would make my parents proud.   I sometimes think of telling you about my dad.  I miss him.  He's still alive - lives in Virginia with his wife and their adopted daughter.  His wife didn't like that he had four kids and so they started over with a new life and have pretty much pretended like we don't exist.  Been about 17 or 18 years now.  Hard to believe.  I saw him when Molly was a couple of months old.  Tonight she dumped out her Skittles and sorted them by color - my dad used to do that with M&Ms.  Kind of weird.  kim  kim

      I know I told you the story about Molly going outside while I napped a week or two ago.  I found out later that she took Jackie (the two year old) with her because "I was scared to go outside alone." (having a 2 year old for backup gives one courage)  She added "but I told her not to run out in the street and she listened to me and she didn't."  As if this was to put my mind at ease about the whole experience.  The day after this happened, my bf installed a chain on the door - all the way at the top.  Even if she got a chair, I don't think Molly could undo it.  I hope.  If she figures that out, I'm going with some kind of thing that sets off an alarm when the door is open.  At any rate, she was furious about the new addition.  She said, "I'm going to tell daddy to take that down as soon as he gets here tomorrow!"  Funny girl.   Even this morning while I was getting ready I heard Molly trying to open the front door - not sure why or where she thought she would go.  I know in the long run a chain is not enough, but for now it works.  kim
