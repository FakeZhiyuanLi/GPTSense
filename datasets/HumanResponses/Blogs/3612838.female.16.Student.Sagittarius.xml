      Oh my gosh...did i say its Independence Day? Well, Happy Independence Day peepz!  I came back into the city early this morn fresh from my month long hibernation in the province. I was so much astounded to think I enjoyed a lot better compared to my past summer vacays.  I really never thought this kind of lunatic escapade could be a more enjoyable one. I just think I'm not anymore into the usual stuff of indulging in some adrenaline-rushing kind. Well, who would agree with me???? But the fact that I enjoyed being just simply laid-back and lazy is something really indulging..  Oh, I'm getting nearer zany but all I know at this point is that, I wanna go back to the province and have fun with my cousins!

       "While you might be a little tight on your finances now, it doesnt mean that you cant give yourself to friends who need you. Find out the best way to be of service today and your problems will eventually take care of themselves"    &nbsp;   My say:   Ok so if i suffered depression in my life, it must have been due to so much self centeredness. Now if i begin to think less of myself and more of others,&nbsp;I realize life would be a lot more exciting and challenging! ;) Yeah, life's always fun when you're with somebody...haha, take it from me, I'm a certified introvert gal but then it just seems so different when you're helping out and you're living your life with a company. Believe me, its always good

        And now Im all alone again   no where to turn no one to go to   Without a home without a friend without a face to say hello to   And now the night is near now I can make believe hes here   Sometimes I walk alone at night when everybody   else is sleeping   I think of him and then I'm happy withthe company I'm keeping   The city goes to bedAnd I can live inside my head   On my own,    Pretending he's beside me,   All alone, I walk with him till morning.   Without him, I feel his arms around me,   And when I lose my way, I close my eyes,   And he has found me...   In the rain,The pavement shines like silver,   All the lights are misty in the river,   In the darkness the trees are full of starlight,   And all I see is him and me,Forever and forever...   And I know it's only in my mind,   That I'm talking to myself and not to him,   And although I know that he is blind,Still I say, there's a way for us...   I love him,But when the night is over,He is gone, the river's just a river   Without him the world around me changes,   The trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers.   I love him,But everyday I'm learning,All my life,I've only been pretending,   Without me,His world will go on turning,   A world that's full of happiness,   That I have never known...   I love him...    I love him...   I love him...    But only on my own...(",)

       It's Monday and I don't have a class precisely because I just got back from my retreat. It's been the most awaited part of my grade 10 life next to my graduation day but anyway lets not talk about that yet coz its still July and as I've said, "Lets live with the present, and be aware of reality." Sounds jerk but I don't want a life fu;ll of fantasy anymore. I'm tired and frustrated of getting myself to dream all the time. But anyway, for sure, I'm graduating this March and well, yes, maybe, I could still be a top student. It's hard, but, "Kakayanin ko to!"   So I'll take you to my diary. Here's the entry I wrote yesterday after I got back from Don Bosco Retreat House.   First, here are the basic facts of the event:     What:  Grade 10 Righteousness retreat     When:  July 24-25, 2004     Who:  Grade 10 Righteousnes girls     Where:  Don Bosco Retreat House     Companions:  Mdm. Gallur and Mdm. Bacalso      &nbsp;   Sunday, July 25    In my Room     &nbsp;   Its been hours since weve finished the retreat and even at this point, I can't help myself but be nostalgic about all the things that has occured in my life over the weekend. It was just next to purr-fect!     &nbsp;   We barely spent 48 hours straight company with each other but I just don't know what's with our class' aura and why I think, all of us think, were so irresistible to love!!! Haha!     &nbsp;   I mean, you know, let me just bring you back first and foremost to our retreat house's wondrous milieu.The place was too perfect for reflection. An ever conducive place for reflecting brimming with lush towering plants. It was all but good.     &nbsp;   Yesterday, the climax of our retreat was the Circle of Love. Bucketful of tears filled the hall but never was a hint of regret found in the hearts of every Righteousnessian in saying sorry and asking for forgiveness. We practically loved telling and showing our friends how much we cared for them. In other words, those were just tears of love and joy.     &nbsp;   Mdm Bacalso and Mdm Gallur were with us together in our crying moments. They were very concerned of us and we can't believe how we got them to love and care for us so much. They're such exemplary teachers who never gets tired of doing everything to lead us unto the right path. They're 2 of the best teachers we love so mucho!     &nbsp;   What event got me practically nostalgic and ever wistful was our slumber together. First time to do such crazy stuffs. Eat, tell ghost stories, share our views on icebreaker cards, share funny moments and laugh at each other's quirks and idiosyncracies. I finally found friends whom I enjoy much of their company- they're the ones who pioneered in the "cute phenomenon" and I don't understand as to what kind of heavenly body fell over me and why I suddenly found myself one day wanting to partake in such crazy "name calling". Haha, I bet, coz its "CooL".     &nbsp;   It was a pleasure to get to know the reality of a person's core behind her superficial facade. I learned something about this today and that is that: each and everyone of us have all but the same needs- the need to be accepted and to belong. But sometimes things get pretty overwhelming and thats when others who fail to fulfill their quota of self advocacy would resort to pathetic far-out self-customizing. And it would appear like their very own self is what you see but its none at all..     &nbsp;   Like some act numb when deep inside they're already hurting and others seem to appear strong and invincible while the truth is they're crushing deep down. Well, we really dont know. Who knows? While some act mean or so diabolic even, but the truth is, they actually have the heart of a marshmallow.     &nbsp;   Sometimes or oftentimes, its hard to figure out people. They're practically the most intricate species to decipher. They're filled with so much wrapskins but actually, the truth behind their facade remains lurking behind and until you can uncover them slowly by getting to know them better.     &nbsp;   People are intrinsically complex. But it makes even more the so-called human psychology and sociology more interesting to talk about.     &nbsp;   The verdict here?    Don't ever judge a book by its cover. Get to know a person first before jumping into conclusions, coz chances are, what you merely see is less than what's really inside. Get to know people and love them! If you could do such, then you finally found the most interesting kind of undertaking available on earth..haha....or so I said. ;P     &nbsp;

       this is such a very day for me. for one thing: we had our elections, and so what? as though im one of those who ran. but anyway it matters still coz i casted my vote and im proud to have done it quite well. anyway the point of my entry is probably the time when we had an inspection with the grade 6 studs and after that, we got a very good kind of scolding for our Corps. no, it wasnt anything humiliating in our part, but the fact that she could really pinpoint to the smallest detail our very errors and it could make us really conscientized, duh, whatever.   so its miss anne's bday tomorrow and i gave her this medium sized orange bday card that didnt really cost my life but anyway cost my time. well that surely means i gave it to her from the heart, no doubt with that, i just certainly love miss anne you know she has been a very big part in my high school life and though i may step my collegiate years very soon, i would never forget the good times i shared with her as well as with the gang.   even if i didnt have my own so-called berks, the PFs certainly and instantly became my berks and dont you think its more than enough?   the pinaka-highlight of my day among all the highlights (i.e. great session in speech and drama (workshops anyone?), the CRYING, the SCOLDING, the BDAY CARD, the singing of AT THE BEGINNING, the emotional subtle way a friend has bruised me today...), siguro i could say the pinaka worthwhile was sharing my heart with a friend who needed it.   i never thought how my friend could be so like me. i mean all this time, the asking of the so-called desperate question. one thing that was very depressing, it could be very hard to beat coz its definitely just herself ang kalaban niya. i pity her and at the same time wants to do something about it. i want to make her know herself but i just simply dont know where to begin and what to do. oh my gosh, its such a pain to think i cant do anything about it now.how i wish to help you renee, from the bottom of my heart..just ask me and im ever ready to lend you a hand. i understand you perfectly coz ive been like that once in my life.

       As the eldest child, I grew up under the parental guidance of my lola. Under my grandmother’s care and supervision, I saw life in a different kind of perspective hearing advices from my lola all the time about simplicity, strengthening one’s faith in God and being good. In addition to that kind of upbringing, my school where I’m in for almost 12 years now, has also molded me significantly into the kind of person that I am. It is an all-girls Catholic school that stresses really the values of simplicity, respect for human dignity, responsibility, compassion for others, and all the while, never failing to inculcate in us the importance of academic excellence. As I grew up, there were numerous instances where in I was made to choose between remaining the kind of person that I knew I was or conforming to what others think and believe for the sake of acceptance. I should say growing up was never easy. You get influences from different kinds of people and even those whom you admire. Sometimes their influences may not be that good at all. But despite all that, I also never sacrificed my values just for the sake of being accepted in a group. I saw to it all the time that my actions were always according to what I learned in school and at home and of course, what I for surely know is right. With regards to my studies, I have consistently placed myself in the honor list since elementary grade. But apart from my hard work to excel in my studies, I also never limit myself from doing just that. As much as possible, I really try to do the things that I love and I try to enhance these talents which I believe I possess. I believe talents are only enhanced once one commits herself to practice it every now and then. Whenever I get to have the luxury of time, I sing and I write. These two things are basically my passion. Through these, I get to express myself more creatively. And to enhance them even more, I take up voice lessons and also take the time to write every single day. In school, I am into my passion of reaching out to others through the Peer Facilitator’s Circle. By being a peer facilitator, there’s a bigger chance for me to get to interact with students in my high school. They come to me for some advice and at times for academic tutorials. But whenever I do my job as a PF, no matter how tiring things can get, the fulfillment I get from helping others is certainly incomparable. With all these and that I am involved in all through out my high school life, I could say that I am more than glad enough being where I stand right now. I know I am nearing towards the end of my secondary education. At least, for the last remaining months that I’m in my school, I want to make the most of my senior year. And I can say that at this point, I am experiencing the best moments of my life. What would probably count the most unforgettable experience I had this year is my grade 10 retreat. Within that one day and a half long experience, I was able to really get in touch with my inner self and take a closer look at my values. Personally, my relationships with my friends and my classmates were strengthened. I had a really great time bonding with my friends and sharing to them things they never once knew about me. This experience made us appreciate each other even more and has made me realize that I was right when I decided not to change anything about myself. After all, at this point in my life, I could say that I’ve finally found friends who could wholeheartedly accept me and love me for what I am. The parent-daughter encounter was also a very significant part of the package. But most of all, I had a very meaningful interaction with God. My faith and spirituality was further strengthened. And that, I think is the most important part of it all.

       I really don't know whats up with me now. I'm ever exhausted and all I can say is that, my batteries all are worn out.       Here's a GOOD news: "I was accepted!" but no, I'm not one of those major characters. Still, I'm glad, at least.      Then there's a lot of actuivities coming over my way, I don't know how to budget my time if in the first place I'm really not given the luxury of it. I can't sleep long hours, and I know my body darnly needs it.      Anyway, chums, as long as you're there, I know I'll be doing fine and oh, great.      I'll post MY PERSONAL ESSAY ON LOVE soon....the next time I'd get back and oh, I'll share to you din my essay for my application in Ateneo.      And oh, the UPCAT exams?????it was just fine, but the mathematics part kinda s****. 'Til here...you SALUT.       Ciao--------;p

       I'm really sorry guys if I haven't been updating my blog regularly. I have long thought of deleting my account here but then, I realized though how small in number they maybe, there still are even a few thoughtful chummies of mine who really take the time to visit my page, and well, I'm glad.      I have promised to never open the net again unless my UPCAT and my 1st PT were over but then, although my UPCAT had been over last Saturday yet, and my PT is fast approaching, I feel the need to open my dashboard here coz there's just practically a lot of things to share.      I'm extra glad taday although my friends know how harrassed I've been for this particular day- harrassed as in totally busy and I even missed both my snacks and lunch just to attend to several meetings. There's the PF<>     It's a part of my morning ritual to come to the Blessed Sacrament every morning as I arrive school but then, with my hectic assignments catapulting nonstop lately, I can't even take the time to visit the chapel now and oh, this make me feel so guilty. Even my at-least-2-times-every-week-or-thrice rosary, I couldn't even accommodate. I feel so guilty to Jesus and to Mama Mary already. I know they understand why but then I just don't think its a reason enopugh for me to miss those very important things to do.      As you might know it, I've auditioned myself to the school's chorale, or is it? Somehow, I've l;ong been coaxed by my friends to join and so, here I am hoping I could make something great out of this endeavor. I've always wanted to, but then its the precios time that I lack, economically speaking, I experience a lot of scarcity with time lately. Nevertheless, here I am, and hoping I get to land in the job. I'm just one of the hundreds of souls ever hopeful. And the school would only take 75 so, I've conditioned myself that whatever the outcome is, I place it all in God's hands coz after all, it'll be His will still and not mine. I know whatever it is, it'll be for something greater than what I expect, with or without the singing job!      So, you're once again reading this busy girl's blog and I wouldn't want to commit to writing on this every so often as time may not permit me to do so. But then, you know where you could find me, call me or email me, or what! ;P       Friends, thanks a bunch for taking the grand time to visit my page. This has been your cute, sweet andf charming charmer (haha) j/k....neighbor here on earth, MAYCEE! LIZZIE! HONEYBEE! whatever that is..I'm OVER and OUT.
