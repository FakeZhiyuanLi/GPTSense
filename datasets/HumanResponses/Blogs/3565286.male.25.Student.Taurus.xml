      So here it is...my first entry. I wonder if anyone is going to read this.  I'm 25 as of May 16th. I wonder were the years went. It seems as if just yesterday I was back in high school smoking a joint in the parking lot and skipping classes, trying to get laid and not having a care for the future. I think it was about my junior year when I started having breathing problems and had to stop my bad habit of smoking only to take up another bad habit of dipping. I wish I'd never started doing that. That's not to say I haven't tried quitting or that I haven't had a good life so far. I'm just having one of those bad days when my neurosis gets the best of me. See, recently I've been overly concerned with abnormalities in my mouth from what I'm sure is my on and off addiction to dipping for the last 8 years. Wow, has it been that long. I had to stop and count. I've quit before for nearly a year... twice, so I guess I've only been dipping for a little over 6 years. I intend to quit for good though, just after this week of finals is over. It really makes me crazy, the dipping that is. Right now my throat is soar and the sores in my mouth have kept me preoccupied all day. Honestly, I'm not accomplishing much in the way of test preparation. I was worried about some bumps under my tongue and after multiple close inspections..you'd be surprised how difficult it is to see clearly inside your mouth...then I discovered a bleeding sore deep on the left side of my tongue. That and looking at pics of oral cancer victims online just freaks me out seriously. I guess that's why I decided to write this journal. I wanted to get my thoughts out there to see for myself just how neurotic I am. I worry that if I die then I'll never be able to fully express all that I am capable of. I want to live a long good life where I can get married, have children, follow my entrepreneurial dreams, do something great for society, and leave a legacy for future generations. I only hope this summer I can start doing whatever it takes to leave my worries behind me, knowing that I've done everything I can to live a long healthy life, and experience all that my dreams hope to be. It all starts now.  I should get some sleep now, seeing as tomorrow I have two dozen articles to read through so that I can write a 5 page research paper on the correlation between primate brain structures and the emergence of mankind, not to mention study for 3 other finals. Goodnight and may tomorrow be productive and enlightening.
