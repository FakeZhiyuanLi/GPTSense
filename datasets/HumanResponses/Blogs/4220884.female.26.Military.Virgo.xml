      Sleep
elusive and taunting
needful and begging
energy foriegn
anxiety ridden
lay down!

close eyes
thoughts churning
dividing
replicating
coinciding
whirlwind
now dizzy
find calm
focus on something
focus on anything

alone
pounding solitude

Shift
roll over
tightened eyes
grasping covers
pretend
comfort
softness
happiness

contrast
reality
always present
irony
gritting teeth
locked jaw
furrowed brow
eyes open
sadness creeping
forever awake

        I keep wanting to express myself, yet I don't seem to be able to find the proper outlet. So I'm going to try this blogger thing in hopes that it may help me in a few situations.

Lately, ambivolence seems to be the word that describes my life best right now. I don't know how well I will be living in a month, finances are so scrambled that I find myself not even bother to look at them, I'm currently up for a DUI which will cost more money and not to mention I hardly have any friends and my family has an odd unidentified viewpoint on me that they don't seem to want to share.

Did i mention I am extremely and annoyingly single? I have no idea how to go out and meet people and I don't even have the money it takes to do so. I have been babbling about trying to get a job recently, accept I can't muster the motivatiion to find a job that I will only keep for three weeks. I'm currently in a program that pays for school but it hinges on the DUI and my grades of this past summer and so far the end doesn't look good. I also don't seem to be able stop complaining about how bad my life is; even though my lack of bitching use to be consider one of my best assets.

Most people I talk to say that I am an alchoholic and that I'm depressed. I don't really believe that I am an alcholic...as for the depression...i probably am depressed but this poses an even larger issue. The program that is paying for school requires that I remain drug free, and I am against counseling because the last two counselors I saw didn't seem to help at all. In fact, one of the counselors really fucked up my head a little more. I am stuck in a rut, in which the most frustrating thing is that I know only I have the power to change things. Everytime I think about what ever it is that i want to do...nothing really comes to mind. I want to be happy, but I don't have any idea of what will make me happy. Nothing really sounds tantaliziing.

The last dream I had was to get a new apartment and make it cute as possible, but my DUI and finance issues seriously prevents the attainment of that dream. In fact, I am moving back home with my cool dad, and fucked up and mean grandmother. I will once again be living in someone's house where the rules and intricacies of the house are strict and overbearing. Not to mention, my two cats are required to stay locked up in my room. I will have to get a lock on my bedroom door just for the assurement that my nosey grandmother doesn't go through all of my shit.

Fall Semester will be starting soon and I will also have the joy of getting up at 4:30 in the morning and having to go running with a bunch of people that are younger and in much better physical shape then myelf. This program also has a spotlight in which I would normally glow under, but lately this spotlight intimidates me and scares me to the point where I just prefer to throw in the towel and go back to my old lifestyle of when all my other needs were fulfilled. At least I had friends, money, a purpose...and depression symptoms didn't exist.
What are my symptoms? Insomnia, frequent nausea, binge drinking, frequent mood swings, and the inability to cope with the simplest tasks...such as changing the kitty litter seem unattainable.

I was voted into this program kicking and screaming. I felt uncomfortable in assuming the role of a full time college student. I feel inadequate in the education department and while the work is usually not that bad...I find myself avoiding going to class because I simply do not know how to mingle, let alone talk to strangers.

I keep toying with the idea of going to see a shrink and seeing if I would get diagnosed with anything other than depression.

Another symptom is that most of the time I am simply sad. Gloom follows my every foot step, I am sad over everything. I watch the wrong comercial and I cry for 10 minutes. I think about actually getting up and doing normal things like laundry and I tend to get sad because I feel like someone should be with me. I feel like the single most lonley person in the world, although in reallity I know it is doubtful.

Every now and then I muster the courage to go online and "chat", but most people in the chat rooms are looking for others to have sex with.. I feel like sex is something so foriegn and so unfullfilling right now that it would make me feel worse...not to mention I really don't like casual sex.

A friend of mine from high school days is trying to re-established our friendship after a very dramatic turn of events...lets just say i dated her ex-boyfriend and she didn't appreciate it. Problem is, I don't trust her because everything and I mean EVERYTHING I tell her gets twisted around and delivered to the ex (now my ex also). I seem to be both her and her/my ex's entertainment...like hey look at my sorry ass life.

Even the strangers I meet seem to notice right off the bat that there is something wrong with me. Why don't I go out, what do I do for fun? I don't know, and i don't know. I like things...but nothing in particular ever really totally was the thing I was "in" to. For instance my pop's really likes baseball, my friend vaughn has his motorcycle and likes to take his daughter to do cool things, a chatter really likes soccer. Me? What's my special interest....traveling but I have hardly traveled anywhere because I am broke ass.

I realize most people will not read this...but if for some reason you landed in this blog and got stuck in it, send me an email just for the hell of it. Say hello to a stranger and I will say hello back. koalabluelily@yahoo.com
Later....hopefully I will be better by next blog
