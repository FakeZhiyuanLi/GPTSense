      Luke 16:19 - 21   "There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day. At his gate was laid a begger named Lazarus, covered with sores and longing to eat what fell from the rich man's table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores."  I had a dream a couple nights ago. I drempt I was among several people on the street. Some were drunk. Some were high on drugs. Some were sick, diseased and really skinny. Some were disabled with no legs, no eyes, no hands. Some were starving. Some were dirty, smelled really bad, torn clothes and no shoes. Some were laying on the sidewalk. Some were in wheelchairs. Some were leaning against a brick wall.   As I walked thru the midst of all these people, every one was crying and reaching out to me saying, "Please, help me." I would tell them to go to the park in Indianapolis the next Sat. and they would get food and clothes. I would tell them to go to the Isaiah 61 meeting on Fri. night and they would get help. I would invite them to come to church on Sun. I walked thru them telling them what they needed to do and where they needed to go to get help.  Each one of them, men, women and children kept reaching out to me begging and crying, "We have no way and cannot get to those places. We need help now. Please help us NOW." The dogs were even showing more compassion for them than I was.    As I continued to walk, I came to a lady who was nothing but skin and bones. She had long dark hair that was all matted together. Her clothes were all torn, she had no shoes. She looked and smelled like she hadn't had a bath in months. She had no teeth and was leaning against the brick wall smoking a cigarette. She was very rude and began cussing me. She was not reaching out to me nor was she asking for help. Here is what she said: "You are just like all the rest of so called "Christians". You live in  homes with furniture, air conditioning and heat. You have your cars to go to the places you need to go to. You have all you want to eat and waste more than it would take to feed us. You have your Dr. and medications. You have your beds to sleep in, your nice clothes and shoes to wear. You have all the luxuries. You are nothing but pampered and spoiled brats. You come out here to us to make YOURSELF feel good but won't even bend down to shake a hand because we are dirty & sick. You won't give us food or meet any of our needs because we are not in the place you think we should be. Just get out of here and leave us alone. We don't need people like you."  I stood there in tears. I knew in my heart she was right and what she was saying was true. We seem to think that people need to be in a certain place to be able to minister to them. We go out for a short time just to make OURSELVES feel good and to be able to tell others "what we did". We don't want to get our hands dirty by touching any of "those kinds of people". We want to be where we can get to our anticeptic hand cleaner and our Lysol spray disinfectant QUICKLY, so we don't get the germs that "those kinds of people" have.   I knelt down beside the lady and took her hand. I ask her to forgive me and told her that I love her and Jesus loves her. Tears began to flow down her face. She said there has never been anyone tell her they loved her or that Jesus loves her. She said nobody wanted to be around her because of her "condition". I put my arms around her and ask her if I could pray with her. She said "Yes, nobody has ever prayed for me before."  Then I woke up. I sat up in bed and began to ask God to forgive me. I thought I was doing the right thing. I go to the homeless twice a month. I go to the jail and prisons. I hold Isaiah 61 meetings once a week. I THOUGHT I was being like Jesus and doing like Jesus done, as the Bible tells us to do. I THOUGHT I was being a servant and serving those in need.  The problem is, I pass by all those people I am around every day. Those I see in the grocery store, WalMart, resturants, neighbors, family, on vacation, at work, people I talk to on the phone (even those salesman!) etc. etc. I wait until I am at the "right place" before I minister to their needs.  There is a man I know that said he didn't know how he was called to minister to anyone. I ask him if he talks to people at work about Jesus. He said no because they would think he was crazy and wouldn't listen to him anyway. He said they are VERY worldly, cussing, talking about other people, talking about all they done over the weekend, etc. etc. So he just goes to work, does his job, stays to himself, and goes home.   This is a prime example of how most "Christians" are. These may be the very people God has put before him like the lady in my dream. A person that only needs someone to love them, just the way they are. To be willing to get their hands dirty or their "spiritual clothes" stained with the dirt of the world. To just reach out and say that you care. That you love them and Jesus loves them. Not to hit them over the head with "religion" and  all they are doing wrong, where they need to go, inviting them to church, etc. But to love them in the gutter of life they may be living in.   Why do alcoholics spend so much time in bars and around other alcoholics? Because those people will listen to them no matter how they look, smell, etc. The bar is their church and the bartender is their pastor and friend.   It is time that we get out of our selfishness and begin to BE JESUS and not just TALKING JESUS. WILLING to give up ALL WE HAVE for those who are "scum" of the earth, like Jesus did for US. (Yes, we were "scum" to Him. He gave up EVERYTHING and He was willing to die for US). Willing to get our hands dirty and our "spiritual clothes" stained. Willing to help someone, in their time of need, no matter where they are. Once people SEE the real Jesus in you, they will want Him to.   I thought I was doing what God called me to do until I had the dream. Stop inviting people to come to church, Bible study, etc. and start BEING THE CHURCH. Then the masses will come in. "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few."  Matthew 9:38 NIV

      I needs some input here. I don't know how to handle this situation, so please help me.  Yesterday, I got a call from a guy who I have known for 33 years. He grew up with my husband and I met him when I met Jerry. He has been an alcoholic all his life. I have helped him numerous times since I have been saved. He is a very lonesome man. What family he has left, won't have anything to do with him. He has never been married but has lived with a few women. He hasn't been in trouble with the law too much. Maybe 2-3 times. He is a very good hearted and kind man. He just has this alcohol problem. He doesn't have an education. He has been a roofer all his life. We had him work for us several times. He is a good worker when he isn't drinking! And so on......  He called me out of the clear blue. I guess because I am the only one who has ever sat and listened to him and never given up on him. He was drunk and threatening suicide. He has tried to kill himself in the past and someone always found him and took him to a hospital. He was crying out for help. I could tell he was desperate this time. I talked with him for 3 hours. I told him I would do what I could to help him. He is living in a "bad" place in Speedway, Ind. From what he told me, it is very demonic. He said there has already been 2 people die there and he felt he was going to be the 3rd. He made the comment that the house would not let him go and he knew if he didn't get out of there, he would die. He knows about God. He acknowledges Jesus, etc. He knows exactly what I would tell him and I did. He wants to be free from the alcohol and bondage he is in, etc. etc. etc. I told him I would see what I could do to help him. He was literally begging for help.  Please pray for a transitional house here. These are the kinds of people that need it so badly. There is no place for them to go and get the kind of help they really need. They need someone to just listen to them and love them where they are at. To lead them on the right road and be there for them. No matter who they are. No matter what the problem is. Oh how I wish I could snap my fingers and have a place. This is the 2nd one I have had come to me in almost the same shape in the last 2 weeks. Let alone all the letters I have gotten from those about to be released from jail and prison, needing a place to go, besides right back into the same enviroment they came out of.  Now to my concern. I was talking to my husband about this guy. Of course, my husband doesn't look at it in a spiritual way. He told me not to talk to him and if he called hang up on him. I knew that is what he would tell me. He has said the same thing before. That is why I hesitated to even tell him he called. But I keep all things like this out in the open to my husband.   My hands are tied. I told him I would help him and possibly find others who would. I know he will be calling me back today and I don't know if I should go behind my husbands back and talk to him and help him or what to do. I feel if I hang up on him, or not even answer the phone, he will lose what little hope he does have. I am the only one who will talk and listen to him, other than the people who supply the drugs and alcohol. You know the only "supposedly" friends people like this have.  Is there anyone who can advise me in this matter? Or is there anyone who can help him, call him, go to talk with him, anything.

      I forgot to add this to what I already wrote. I was told that the radio station, WJCF 88.1, has been putting in a plug about Isaiah 61 and the luau. Marty was talking about the salvations and even talking about me in my grass skirt. My granddaughter called me today because she heard it on the radio and she was laughing! I thank God for what He is doing with this ministry. Isaiah 61 has never had any promotion except for when we were having the outreaches. I knew God was resurrecting Isaiah 61, for such a time as this. Thank you Jesus!

      I couldn't wait until tomorrow to post this. I am high right now. What else is new lately????  We had a HOLY GHOST blowout of a Bible Study tonight. There were 15 adults and who knows how many kids! There was 1 salvation and several deliverances. People were set free from their past, bondages, and demonic oppression. Some couldn't stand up, others were crying uncontrollably. It was so awesome. We had the annointing oil out smearing it all over people. God was there and the Spirit was moving in a mighty way. I think we may of had "CHURCH"!!!!  Looking forward to next Wed. OOPS, most of those that were touched will be at the race track Sat. for opening day, (weather permitting, it is suppose to rain). So who knows what is about to happen there on Sat. night! YEEEEEEEHAAAAAAAAAAW !!!!!!!!!!!!

      I have just been sitting on the sidelines in awe, watching God work. Just thinking 2-3 weeks ago, I QUIT everything. Well, I said I did anyway. I was so down, depressed, distraught, disoriented, etc. etc. etc. It is like my life has done a complete 360 the last few days. Mainly since the luau.  Not only has the Bible study done a turnaround with the new people, another one of them was saved Sun. So that made 7 total that attended the luau who gave their life to Christ. Then, 4 others that came to the luau, was in church with us Sunday. I said that when people see Jesus on the OUTSIDE, they will find the church even if it is out in a cornfield somewhere!   Today, I found out my unsaved son, who helps run this business, hired one of the guys who was saved at the luau. This is just blowing my mind. Then, they will all be racing together beginning this weekend. God is putting these things together. There is no way anyone could of worked all this out the way it has happened.  Tomorrow night is BIble study. I am so excited to go. My friend, who God has renewed our friendship, will be going back also. Then all the new ones. If everyone goes who says they are, there will be 16 adults and 13 kids. To think this Bible study was going to end after this week! I think God has other ideas. We just may have church!   A spiritual life is alot like Indiana weather. If you don't like it one day, just wait, it will change the next!

      I felt that today I needed to give an update, praise report and prayer requests. Things have taken a drastic turn in my life and Isaiah 61. It is very exciting after so many months of waiting, wondering, searching, stretching, screaming, yelling, grumbling, complaining and growing. Sounds a little like the Isrealites in the wilderness doesn't it? I have wanted to give up MANY times. I have felt that God just wanted me to sit here for the rest of my life. I felt my time was done as far as "ministry on the outside".  Our Bible study group fell apart and it was going to stop the end of this month. BUT GOD!!!!!! It has turned in a whole new direction and will be going forward. A friendship I once had fell apart. BUT GOD!!!!!! We are now back together and ministering together even stronger than we were before. My family was going the wrong direction. BUT GOD!!! They are coming back and one is even ministering to people, which totally blows me away! We struggled financially and lost so much, I didn't think we would survive at times. BUT GOD!!!!! We are doing a lot better and have even had some debts cancelled when we went to pay them! I have fought depression so much. BUT GOD!!!! Those negetive thoughts are gone and I have a renewed vision, peace and hope for the future again. I was finished with outreaches. BUT GOD!!!! Yes, there will be more outreaches and street ministry that has already proven to be stronger than ever. God has done some changing in Isaiah 61 and has opened new doors and shut old doors. It is exciting to know He isn't finished with me yet!  Here is some of the things God has put on my heart for the rest of the year as far as Isaiah 61 goes. So please pray that people will be saved, delivered and set free through them. 1. I already wrote last week about the race track mission field! There is a totally different feeling about it this year. It seems so right. I was out there yesterday during practice, praying in the pits! I know God is in this! 2. We usually have a booth at the county fair in July. For some unknown reason, the application didn't get sent to me in time this year. When I called about it, they were already booked. God then put on my heart that we were to still go but be out with the people and not in a booth. Passing out tracts, talking to people, etc. 3. The next outreach will be in Sept. It will be a Country and Western theme. All Saturdays are taken so we had to pray for a different day. The more I prayed, Sun. kept coming to my heart. We never had one on Sun. before until now! We will be having church! 4. I was having a really hard time wanting to do the Womens Prison Christmas Party this year. I know now, that God does want it to go on. So in Dec. we will be having the big Christmas Party at IWP in Indianapolis. 5. We never could get a booth space at the fall festival. God told me to do the same thing there as He said to do at the county fair. Still go but be out there with the people. One thing about all this, we don't have to worry about setting things up, being there at certain times, having people to help, no schedules, and very little money involved! It is all spontanous. I love it! 6. I am now going back with the group to feed the homeless, as I wrote about on Sat. It was so awesome to have a ministry area that we never had before and people coming over to me voluntarily. It was great. 7. I plan on going back to the jail twice a month soon. I have missed that so much. With the physical problems I have had to stop going because of the climbing steps and walking that I have to do. The same is with Bible study weekly at the womens prison and the visiting at other prisons I was doing. I have been ask to come back but haven't been able to because of the walking it involves. I know God is working all this out. 8. Future plans are, a) to go with the New Castle Dream Center on adopt a block. Then to begin one here in Greenfield, Ind. b) to start the transitional house in Hancock Co. for those coming out of jail/prison, in trouble, and just plain "throw away people." (By the way, the old nursing home building is still empty. God gave me that vision almost 3 yrs. ago. I know that building will be Isaiah 61's!)   Prayer request: I have fought this and fought this. I have prayed and prayed and prayed. I know what God keeps telling me but I really didn't want to hear it quite that way. Yes, you can call it pride. I will admit that! I believe I am going to be healed. God has told me all this physical stuff is temporary but I have to be faithful to do what He tells me to do. No matter how I have to do it. He told me it was like a person who has a broken leg, etc. They have to use crutches for awhile until the healing is finished. Yet, I still fight the idea of a wheelchair. I feel God has changed things like the fair booth and told me to minister other ways so I would have to stop fighting this and be obedient. So, I have given in and I am praying for the money to get a power chair or get one some way. That way, I don't have to depend on others to be with me to push a regular wheel chair. This would allow me to be able to go to the fair, the fall festival, the jail, the prisons and adopt a block.    So, there is what is going on with Isaiah 61 and myself lately. I am excited to see what God has and is doing. The changes He has made and His faithfulness to not give up on me when I wanted so many times to give up on Him. Please be praying for all of these and for me to be able to "Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation." The part of the "world" God has given to me for the time being anyway! God is so awesome!

      I have to write a quick post and PRAISE GOD for what He is doing. I haven't went to feed the homeless, on the streets in Indianapolis, with the group this past winter because of physical problems. I was so upset that I couldn't walk around and talk to the people. I only sat in the background. Today, I went back. I had a table with tracts and Bibles on it, and sat in a lawn chair.  I had several people come over to me and we talked about the Lord. I felt like I was doing something this time! When most people had left and the food was gone, a lady came up to me in tears. She said they needed me down the sidewalk from where I was sitting. I got up and went to a group of people standing there. A man was crying talking about how God wouldn't forgive him, he was so bad, etc. After we talked with him a few minutes, he did accept the Lord and all at once he began crying out and praying to God in a LOUD voice. He was desperately wanting God to heal and deliver him of drugs and alcohol. He was literally, crying out!!! It was so awesome. God is working and I am so thankful I was there to see this man saved and delivered today.

      OK, what is up with this? God answered my prayers and then He turned around and unanswered my prayer. What the heck is going on? Am I missing something here?   The past 5 years, my family has been very involved in stock car racing. Because of the point system, most of my family couldn't race thunder cars any longer. Although I still had 2 nephews that were going to race this year, I thought the racing days were finished. I was thanking and praising God for His faithfulness in answering prayer. Then, out of the clear blue, a week ago, my middle son hits me with the news, he is racing this year. He had to go up to another level which he chose late model cars. The ones that cost thousands of dollars. He found one that was race ready. Just the motor cost $7000.00. Since the guy knew the family and has raced with them the past years, he was willing to sell it to him for a mere $10,000.00. He was so excited. My heart sank. Oh, what I could do for the kingdom of God with $10,000.00.  The racing season begins May 1. I have been thanking and praising God all these months for delivering my family from racing and I wouldn't have to spend every Sat. night at the track. Then God does this to me. What is He thinking? What have I done so wrong that He is putting this pressure back on me again. I don't think I want to trust God anymore after this! (Just kidding)  My son got on the phone and began making calls to get sponsors. If you knew him, he is NOT one to talk much to people. He has raised ALL the money to buy the car, one sponsor is buying the gas for the whole season, one is paying for the pad at the track, he has sponsors to buy a trailer and one paying his membership for the season. He said all he needs now is one to buy all his cheeseburgers every Sat. night and he will be set! He hasn't been out a penny on any of this. All this has just boggled my mind.  After I think about it, I think God just may be in all of this. My oldest son, who couldn't race this year because he also went over the points limit, has been building race cars for people. He has been able to share the gospel with so many just through that. He has been helping race drivers by giving them things they may need, etc. showing the love of Christ in each one. 3 of the 6 that were saved at the luau were ones who he had witnessed to at the race track. 1 of the others was a friend of theirs and the other 2 were wives. So all the salvations and the new ones at Bible Study all came from the track. So maybe God is in this after all!  My son, who will be racing, has never accepted Christ. So maybe God does have His hand in all of this. Just maybe God is working "behind the scenes" that I don't see at this point. You know, He does have a way of doing sneaky things like that! Just maybe He is preparing to do something big at the track. I raced 2 years ago and I was in the pits and saw what was out there. It was definately a place where Jesus would of loved to hang out! The good, the bad and the ugly! I thought the bars were bad. They are nothing compared to the pits at the race track. Definately, throw away people in some peoples eyes.  I have come to the conclusion that it is meant for me to be back at the race track for another year. I sit in the stands and pray ALOT! I get to witness to others around me and I have prayed for people there too. So maybe God DID answer my prayer, just not the way I wanted. I sure would not of been there this year if my son had not of gotten this car and it looks like God provided everything so he could. So beginning May 1, I will be out on that mission field again on Sat. nights. So please be praying for me and my family and that all this will bring souls into the kingdom.

      I had to write a quick post tonight. I just got home from the most exciting Bible Study, if you can call it that, I have ever been to. 5 of the 6 that were saved at the luau was there. 4 of them had no clue about the Bible, etc. It was all back to the basics! It was so awesome. Why did Jesus have to be beaten like that? What about tithes? Is satan powerful? Why was there sacrifices and do we still have to do them? Will we get whatever we speak? How do we pray? Why do we get chills and goosebumps? Simple, basic questions from new believers. It was so awesome!!! I was so thrilled to just explain the "basics" of the Christian faith. They also talked about the luau and how they felt "something" there. We also talked about the movie, The Passion of the Christ. There was a total of 21 there including the kids. Some said they had never been in a Bible study and didn't really want to come tonight. But they thought they would try it and said they really liked this because they could ask questions about anything. After 3 hours we had to just call it time to stop. They are all suppose to be back next week. Thank you Jesus for the luau and the ones who were touched by your Spirit.

      My mother passed away, suddenly, in Feb. 1984. My nephew drowned in July 1984. My father-in-law, (who had became my dad since my dad passed away when I was 12), passed away suddenly, in Nov. 1984. All 3 died "suddenly". No warning. No time to say goodbye. There, then gone.  I guess this is on my heart since Susan Goff's (a friend at church), father passed away Sun. and the funeral is today. This makes 3 of her family members within 15 months who have passed away. I know how she is feeling right now. I wish there was something I could do to ease the pain. There is no words that can do that.  When I went through that time, I did not know the Lord. I was very far away from Him. He wasn't even a thought in my mind at any time. As I look back, I can see His hand on me anyway. After the death of my father-in-law, I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. All that was too much in such a short period of time. I was medicated for a few days and on bedrest. I did pull through but it took awhile.  Jesus sent the Holy Spirit to be our comforter. He promises us perfect peace if we only lean on Him. He is our strength when we are weak. We do have hope in seemingly hopeless situations. We don't always understand the "WHY" things happen, but we do have the promise that God WILL see us through. He will take the bad and bring good out of it as long as we keep our trust in Him. There is still that resurrection power in all things that happen to us.  In Jan. 1997, my brother passed away, suddenly. This time, I had a personnal relationship with the Lord. But he didn't. I was ask to do his funeral. I hesitated. I didn't think I could do that. Then I realized, it wasn't me that would be doing it. I had Jesus now. So I agreed to do it. I had to totally allow God to take over because I knew that I couldn't stand up there and do what was ask of me in my own strength. God is so awesome. He took over right from the start. He literally held me up. I literally felt His arms around me. He gave me the words to say. He never let me go. He gave me strength and peace to get through that time. Yes, I still miss my brother alot. Yes, I still grieved. But it was so different that time. I had Jesus to help me through it all. I didn't have to rely on myself and others. All I had to do was lean on and trust Jesus. Keep my focus on Him to get me through the pain and hurt.  We have all kinds of things happen to us in this life. Alot of which we always have the question, "WHY". There is one thing I have found out that is certain, WITHOUT GOD, THERE IS NO PEACE. WITH GOD, THERE IS PEACE !   Sue, I want to encourage you to lean on Jesus through this time. He is your comfort and peace. I know all the thoughts that are probably raging in your mind. I know I wanted to throw in the towel and run as far away as I could. There is one thing for sure, Jesus is right there with you. He NEVER leaves you. As long as you will lean on and trust Him, He WILL see you through. He will give you that perfect peace that only He can give.  Father I lift Susan and her family to you today and ask that you will hold them in your arms and strengthen them through all of this. I know it is so hard to lose family members, let alone so close together. Even when I didn't know you, I can look back and see that you were there with me. I ask that you will comfort her and fill her with your perfect peace that is beyond our understanding. I ask that you will use this for your glory and use Sue and her family as mighty witnesses of your love, peace and strength to others that go through times like this.   In Jesus Name   Amen

      Monday morning. Where do I begin? I am coming down off the high from the weekend. Trying to absorb all that has happened. I am just in awe with my chin hanging on the floor. Why do we KNOW what God will and can do and when He does it, we are so "shocked"?   The luau (outreach) was such a success. It was the one that I even questioned if it was God that told me to do it. I got so "in the flesh" planning this and "lost it" several times. I was pushed to the brink of falling back into the worldly things I use to do. I cussed more through this time and yelled at people more than I have since I have been saved. Of course, I think those of you that read my blogs already knew all that!!! So use this as a lesson in your life!!! Don't do what I done. When you are to the end of your rope and throwing your arms up to quit, remember that something BIG is about to happen. That is why satan is throwing all that stuff at you. Especially doubt.  God is so faithful even when we aren't. One another blog the post was about "What About ME". That is exactly where I was. I didn't care anymore about reaching out to anyone else. I was fed up. Let them go to hell. I didn't care. Or so I thought! (Now, don't get to laughing to hard!) God will use anything and anybody He can to speak to us. In my case, one of those, among many, was Donald Trump, of all people!  My son came in this morning and was telling me he was with some of those Sun. evening, that were saved Sat. at the luau. That is something else I am in awe about, how God has changed him and using him! They had a big cookout and spent time talking about Jesus and the Bible. He shared some of his experiences and life with them. He told me that he didn't go to church though, last night. I told him, "You WERE in church. You were having church at the cookout with those people!" That is what "church" is all about!! All of them are suppose to come to our Bible study on Wed. He told me to be ready because they had alot of questions for me and it may get wild!! I am just in awe of all this happening because of the luau. One of the guys that was saved, his sister, lives with a satanic priest. They had a little discussion on that, as well. So who knows what God has planned in all of this.   I keep looking back at the struggle I had putting this together and what has came out of it so far. I KNOW how satan works when there is something big about to happen for the Lord. Yet, I allowed myself to get all "bent out of shape" and act stupid. I have made a decision in all of it. There WILL be other outreaches. I don't care how much it cost. I don't care what I have to go through. I don't care where I have to go. If just this one made this much difference in so many peoples lives, including my son, I WILL NOT stop now!   So look out. Isaiah 61 has been, RESURRECTED!!!!!

      PRAISE THE LORD......GLORY TO GOD.......THANK YOU JESUS........HALLELUJAH........WOW, WHAT AN AWESOME GOD WE SERVE.  Now, I can write! I am so full of the Lord this morning. I want to just love on Him. The luau was so awesome. God was definately in it. A few weeks ago, I was wondering if it was God that told me to do this or just me. You know back when I quit everything!!!!! Geesh....I still can't believe I acted like that.  First, God gave me the strength I needed to get through the day. I was out and going for 14 hours! That is God. There was no way I could of done it myself. Then I could even get out of bed this morning!! Hallelujah!!!!!!!!!  The weather was BEAUTIFUL. The park was FULL of people. Two guys went out to pass out flyers and they got to witness to and pray with several people. I did wear a grass skirt and done a "new" hula dance! Well, really, I don't think it was anywhere near the hula!!!! I did find out you  have to be real careful how you do some things in a grass skirt! Especially, go to the bathroom!   It ended up, there were 6 salvations and 1 man received the Holy Ghost!  As people were leaving, they were asking me when the next one was. This was "suppose" to be the LAST one I was going to do. Well, I guess God has different plans so I better listen to Him. So many people were touched and there were probably more that we don't even know about. It was an awesome day. There just isn't any other words to describe it.  Thanks to all of you who prayed for this. Thanks to all of you who prayed for ME! It was a huge success and we DO serve an awesome God!!!!!!!

      Just a quick note to let you know most everything is in place for the luau tomorrow. I feel it is going to be great. I know of several of those, what we classify as "lost" people, that are going to be there! I am excited.  I know this may sound strange coming from "ME" but I want to share this. Chris Reason's blog, made me think of it and so I thought I would share my experience. I began watching  Donald Trump and "The Apprentice" when it first came on. I guess it is because we are in "business" for ourselves and wanted to see if we could get any pointers! Last night, the finale, I learned ALOT from listening to Mr. Trump. I used it in the ministry with this luau today, and it worked so well. It seemed things went smoother and I didn't "get in the flesh" when one big let down happened. I was so proud of myself. I am patting me on the back!  Think it is time to say good night and sign off for a couple days. Please be praying for us as we "Go out into the world and preach the gospel" tomorrow! Love Ya!

      I am so stressed.  1. The luau is tomorrow and my grass skirt is too little and my coconut bra is too big.  2. My dog got in the trash this morning and ate the poop out of my granddaughters diaper that was in it.  3. I dropped half a chocolate chip cookie in my full cup of coffee. I hate sweetened coffee.  4. I burned my fingers trying to get the cookie out of my full cup of coffee.  5. I missed Benny Hinn and Joyce Meyer this morning because I was cleaning up the trash that my dog got into.  6. I am going to lunch with a friend and have nothing to wear. Now that is a scary thought!  7. The sun is shinning on my computer and I can barely see the screen.  8. My husband has a toothache. (Women, you know how men are!) Geesh.....Just get over it!!!!!  9. I got advice on another blogsite on how to live with dirty windows. Now my dog licked it and there is slobbers running down my natural draperies.  10. People are going to start telling me to shoot my dog!  11. People call here all the time telling me their roof is leaking and it needs fixed. Don't they know I have worse problems of my own?  12. Yesterday was tax day. I had to lick that ungodly, evil envelope from the IRS. Now I need to cast out those evil spirits.  13. We finally have money in the bank. Now I have to worry about balancing the checkbook this month.  14. My granddaughter decided she was going to play fear factor.  She got a worm and put it in her mouth. She chomped it twice and puked. I can't kiss her any more!  15. I tried calling God this morning and the operator said my long distance had been shut off. So I thought I would just call 911 but forgot the number.    16. I opened the Bible to see what God wanted to tell me today. It opened to the blank pages between the New and Old Testament.  17. I got a letter addressed to occupant. I put it back in the mailbox with a note attached. There is no body by the name of Occupant that lives here. I didn't want to be accused of mail fraud on top of everything else.  18. I ate 6 deviled eggs yesterday. I woke up at dawn this morning, standing in the middle of my bed, crowing.  19. I was laying hands on my dog, praying for him to be delivered of demons, he growled and bit me.  20. I think I just need to go back to bed the rest of the day. I can't handle all of this. Then again, maybe I won't. I learned that there are bugs on my mattress and pillow called "dust mites".   AND YOU THINK YOU HAVE PROBLEMS.............GEESH!

      OK....Today is "preaching to ME" time....AGAIN!!!!!! I have been around this mountain TOO many times and I don't want to do it again. I have been slapped in the face most of the week. I think I got the message. Of course, I THOUGHT I had it long before now but I found out I had to go around that mountain AGAIN. I still hadn't learned the lesson.   Most of you know by now my biggest grip is having to depend on people and complaining because I don't get enough help. My BIGGEST pet peeve is when someone says they WILL do something and don't. All I ask is if they find out they can't do as they said they would, just let me know. Simple. Anyway, this luau has been no different.  I have complained and grumbled and gripped ever since I started planning this. The same old thing. Well, no wonder it turned out the "same old way". That is what I was confessing and believing. That was what I was expecting to happen and it has. My attitude hadn't changed and everything went the same way as it always has. I made a comment at Bible Study last night and as soon as I said it the thought hit me. Besides the looks of those that were here. I said, "You can't get anybody to do anything". Those that were here are a few of the faithful ones that help everytime. They had hurt looks on their faces. As soon as I said it, the thought came to my mind, "That is a lie."   I do have people who help me. It isn't true that "nobody" will do anything. I also remembered what a guy told me once when I was throwing one of those fits. He ask me, "Who did God tell to do this, you or someone else?" If He told me, HE will supply all that is needed and the right people to help. It is not up to me anyway. Why can't I learn that? DUH.    It wasn't until I threw up my hands and said, "I QUIT. WHATEVER HAPPENS, HAPPENS", that God began to work. All the time He was waiting on me to do just that, QUIT! He won't interfere with our plans. He will stand right there and allow us to do what WE think should be done. How many times have I done this very thing. Ever since I started doing the prison parties and outreaches! Now how many YEARS has that been? I really don't want to say!!!!! It is too embarassing!  So now, I got my head on straight, my focus back on Jesus and going forward in the right way. WHEW, I feel so much better!! All it took was a change of...........A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E.

      This Sat. is the luau. It is going to be sunny and 75 degrees. Since we had very little advertising, I was excited to hear what the weather is going to be. The place we are having this is in the park. With the weather that nice, I know it will be filled with people. So we are planning on having people go out with flyers and bring them in! Is that what the scripture means when it says to go out into the highways and byways and compel them to come in? Usually all you have to say is 'FREE FOOD" and you have everyone following you!! So please be praying for this event. I know it is going to be great. There have already been some really bad attacks. That is always a sure sign.  I want to Praise the Lord for His Holy Spirit. The last few days He has been talking to and directing me in some things I need to do and the way I need to go. I have been praying about this for some time. I knew God was doing something different but I didn't quite know what. He has began telling me and I am getting really excited about it. One of the things is, I will get to go to Chicago in June after all. God provided the money that I needed. Our financial situation has turned and is alot better now. I thank God for all of you who prayed us through it and helped financially.  I got my eyes off Jesus a few times and acted really stupid. I wasn't a very good witness for the Lord at all! I thank God that He was still there with me and didn't allow me to fall away. In the last days, people are going to be deceived and will turn away from the Lord. I can see how easy that could happen. It has happened to a some I know personnally, just the past few months.  I thank God for His unconditional love, His grace and His mercy. I thank God for His faithfulness even when we aren't. I thank God for His Word and His promises. I thank God for His favor. I thank God for sending His One and Only Son to take upon Himself our iniquities so we wouldn't have to bear them. I thank God for the Peace, Strength, Joy and Hope that we have in Him. I thank God that my name is written in the Lambs Book of Life. I thank God that He has a purpose for each of us. I thank God for who He is. We are nothing without Him.

      Are Friends Really Friends Forever?  My friend, I stand in judgement now And feel that you are to blame somehow... On earth, I walked with you day by day And never did you point the way.  You knew the Lord in truth and glory,  But never did you tell the story. My knowledge then was very dim; You could of led me safe to Him.  Though we walked together on the earth,  You never told me of the second birth. And now I stand this day condemned, Because you failed to mention Him.  We walked by day and talked by night, And yet you showed me not the light. You let me live, and love, and die, You knew I'd never live on high.  Yes, I called you "Friend" in life,  And trusted you through joy and strife,  And yet on coming to the end, I cannot now, call you "My Friend".  Luke 9:26 - "If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, The Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels."

      Happy Resurrection Day!!!!  I am probably the only one who is "blogging" today. All my family had other plans today, which is fine. We went to Burger King after church for our Easter meal! The rest of the day will be a day of rest! Just me and my husband. That don't happen very often.   I wanted to praise God for His faithfulness. Most of my family was in church this morning. One son and daughter in law wasn't there. I am really blessed because my husband went. He had told me he was going and Sat. he had a tooth break and was in some bad pain. I KNEW it was satan trying to stop him from going to church. I began praying and called a few others to start praying. I filled him up with pain meds too! He was feeling better this morning and did go. Thank You Jesus!  My next to youngest granddaughter grabbed the hot muffler on the lawn mower yesteray and had 2nd degree burns on her hand. She was fine this morning. They did take her to the ER and had it checked yesterday. Thank You Jesus for your protection.  God has been putting people in my oldest son's path to witness to. I am so blessed to see how he has grown the past year. I was so afraid that when racing season began, he would fall away like he does every spring. He has been able to use the racing season as a way to witness. I still am in awe of how he has been talking about church, Bible study and Jesus to others.  Things are coming together for the luau next Sat. I was so frustrated, as some of you know, I finally just threw up my arms and told God it was all in His hands. I give up. Whatever happens, happens. I know, that is what I should of done in the beginning! Things are shaping up now. I am just standing back watching God bring everything together.  I want to praise God for HIs faithfulness to us when we act like jerks. I had a bad couple weeks and if I had of been God, I would of knocked me out by now! I thank Him for his grace and mercy that is new every morning. I praise Him that He reached down and go a hold of my life 16yrs. ago and accepted me just the way I was. I praise Him that I do have hope and He jerks a knot in our tail and forgives us when we tend to get bent out of shape!   I Love The Lord Today. He is so wonderful!

      OK  it has been almost 24 hours. I just couldn't go a few days without sharing the praises of today. I think God is behind this to tell you the truth!!  DUH!!!!  First, I went to lunch with a friend. We were talking about changes I feel God is wanting me to do as far as ministry. I began telling her what I have been feeling God is saying to me. She looked at me so funny. When I stopped, she said that God had been telling her the exact same things! It was so awesome! We sat and talked about what we are going to do to reach the lost and throw away people. It was so great. I can't even tell you how it felt. I have been praying for a LONG time for God to tell me what He wanted me to do since I am so "physically challenged" so I don't have to depend on other people to do so much of it. He told me today! Or maybe just confirmed what I was already feeling!   Next, this evening, my husband told me that WE needed to go to WalMart. I looked at him and thought, "Yeah, right. Remember I am the one who you didn't consider even being my friend last week. You have never wanted to take me to WalMart or anywhere that I have to use other means of getting around before". I looked at him and ask if he was serious. He said, "Yes." My son and daughter in law came and we all went to WalMart!!! Then we went out for supper. I know that sounds so silly for most of you, but it had been 8 months since I have been in that store. I have done without so many things that I didn't have the money to buy. I knew I couldn't walk and if you go during the day, there isn't any of the "scooters" available. All the "older people" go during the day that need them. So us "younger ones" are left out!! When we got there my husband let me out at the door and there was a scooter waiting for me!!!! I was so excited!!!! Go ahead and laugh. I think it is funny too!!! I had the most wonderful hour in WalMart. Being able to go and then having the money to get the things that I have done without so long!!!   I just had to share all that God done today. I feel so much better. There is no words to describe how I feel right now. With all the moving around I have done today, my body is in alot of pain, but that is insignificant compared to how I feel emotionally and spiritually tonight!!!   Thank you Jesus for this day. Most of all, Thank You for answers to prayer!!! It has definately been a "GOOD FRIDAY"!!!

      I want to ask everyone to be praying for all those who lost their homes in the storms and tornadoes over the weekend. Some lost their jobs because of damage to their work place. Residents in a nursing home on the southside of Indy, don't have a "home" now. The good news is, we can praise God for His hand of protection on all those who were in the midst of the storms. Especially those in that nursing home.

      For several months now there has been alot of talk about revolution, postmodernism (whatever that may be) and change. Talk about what God is "going" to do, what changes needs to be made, what needs to be done, how different things will be and how different things may look. What has really bothered me the most about all of this is, what is anyone actually doing for the kingdom of God? Is it all talk? Are people sitting around the community just having conversation and disagreements, just to pass the time? God is moving NOW. Things are happening NOW. There has been very little said about what God is doing NOW in their lives or ministry. How God has used them in different places, etc. It would seem to me that there would be more talk about what God IS DOING with all the changes that are supposedly taking place. Has anyone even seen or experienced the changes? Or are they still just as content in the place they have always been. I just don't understand.  With me, the last few months my life has been in a whirlwind. God has done some serious changing in me and it hasn't been fun at all. Those of you that read my blogs regularly know what I am talking about. He has taken me to a new level that includes leaving alot of the "familiar" things I once knew behind. Yet, He has put new and exciting things in their places. Alot of my thinking has changed. Some of my beliefs have changed. My lifestyle has changed. Different people have come into my life, alot through the blogs. It is exciting and yet scary at times. Others that are experiencing the changes in their lives, are aware of the fear that comes with it. Some even stop and won't to go on. It is a whole new ball game and we are in the final inning. It is time to either get in or out. There is no middle ground, no gray area, any longer. It is time to repent, get real and get serious about our walk with God, before it is too late.  I want to be different. I want to be out of my mind and have the mind of Christ. If others don't want to go full speed ahead with what God is doing NOW, then stay behind. I'm sick of talk. I'm going forward. Dare to take that step into the unknown. Be willing to feel uncomfortable and discontent. God will guide and direct your every step. I have wasted so much of my life and I refuse to waste any more of it. There are hurting, desperate, lonely, broken people out here going to hell. What are we doing about it? Are we going to keep sitting around in our comfortable homes, churches, and cyberspace, talking about what God is going to do in the "future"? Questioning if He will do what He says He will do? Or are we going to take that leap of faith, get serious about God and do what He needs us to do? To be willing to go against the flow, go wherever He needs us to go and be the person He needs us to be.   Talk is cheap. Actions are expensive. Are we going to be a greedy person or a cheerful giver? It is our choice. It's getting late.

      WOW.....what a week this has been. I am still in awe of God. He is so good and so faithful to His children. There is NOTHING impossible with God. I don't care how big the mountain may seen, it is never to big for God to bring down. I have started believing for the BIG things and let God out of the box.   I am going to the cemetary today to put flowers on my mom, dad and father in laws grave. I don't mind going there. The only thing that bothers me is not knowing where they are now. My dad passed away when I was 12yrs. old, in 1969. My mom and father in law both passed away in 1984. None of them ever confessed Jesus. I know they believed in God, but I have no idea if they had given their lives to Jesus. When Jesus rescued me, this was the thing that bothered me the most. Would I ever see them again? It worried me for along time until I read the scripture where I had to let go of father, mother, brother, sister, etc. With the strength and help from God, I was able to do that. I do still wonder at times if I will see them again, but it doesn't have me in the bondage that it once had me in.  These are the most exciting days to be living in. Just to see all God is doing and to be a part of it. Since I got the chair yesterday, I feel like a prisoner that has been set free. There are so many places that God has put on my heart to go to and I am able to go now. I again want to thank everyone for their prayers. You don't know what this meant to me. I pray God will bless those ABUNDANTLY who provided the money for me to get it. I will try to keep the speed under 100mph. I don't want to come back on here and ask for prayer for money to pay a speeding ticket! Although, I did see a man who was drunk get arrested for driving a golf cart and running into a person. They took him to jail! Now if I get drunk in the Holy Ghost and start driving recklessly, I may end up there also. That's ok though. I LOVE to go to jail and prison! I will be like Paul and Silas, I will praise God and witness to those around me! I can see the headlines now....."Hula Grandma gets arrested for driving a wheelchair while intoxicated in the Holy Ghost"!   Oh GEESH......I better stop here. That makes me want to go get a drink of that new wine, that daily dose of the Holy Ghost! Lord, fill me up to where I am out of my mind and drunk on you! Anyone else wanna join me?

      Many of you got the prayer request about my granddaughter. She is still in the hospital but better. The CT scan was normal, so that is good. They have went into her ear and got some of the infection out and will do it one more time. Hopefully she will be coming home tomorrow. Thanks for the prayers. God is so awesome!  Talk about an awesome God, this has been an unbelieveable week and it is only Wed.! Monday was jail night and I got up the steps for one! Then there were 2 salvations and 1 rededication. Praise the Lord. I also received a card in the mail that really encouraged me. It was such a blessing that someone would take the time to send an encouraging word. Yesterday, I received the news of a wonderful person donating $1700.00 of the $1900.00 for the power chair I need. Then I had the other $200.00 donated. The balance left was $64.00. I think I can handle that part! I was in shock to say the least. The 30 days is up today. I will call them today and tell them I will be on my way to get it tomorrow!! I am sure they will wait another day. I have a Dr. appt. today and my granddaughter is in the hospital, so I can't go today.  God is so wonderful. I don't know how people make it out here without the Lord. He is truly our Strength, our Hope, our Peace, our Joy, our Provider, our LIFE! Since I will be able to go more places now, I feel like a prisoner that has been set free. I am so excited to see what God has planned the next few months.  I know some of you are in that "funk" right now. I want to encourage you to not give up. I was there just a short time ago. God has done some amazing things just the last couple months. He will do the same in your life. Stand firm. You are NOT forgotten! God is preparing you for a promotion! He will be taking you to the next level. It will be UNBELIEVABLE when it happens! Keep fighting the good fight of faith. Keep running the race. You are special and you are loved. Your breakthrough is at hand! I guarantee it!

      I had to write tonight. I couldn't wait until tomorrow! I went to jail for Bible Study this evening. It was the first time I had been able to go in about 7 months. I really missed it BIG TIME. I have been going there for 12 years. I felt pretty good today so I decided I would go and I WOULD make it up those steps. Praise the Lord, I made it! I had to stop twice but I got there!   There were 8 women that came. I was just thrilled to be there again. It always blesses me even more than the women when I go. Anyway, God moved in their hearts and there was 2 salvations and 1 rededication. It was so awesome. One of the ladies was being treated badly in there because of racism. She cried most of the time. They even have her in a cell by herself. I am so upset at how the women are treated in this county jail. It has been like this ever since I began going in 1992 and getting worse. Anyway, I think the Bible Study helped her and she was more at peace when she left. One lady ask me if I would call her daughter and let her know that she is ok. She hasn't talked to her since she has been in jail. So when I got home, I called her. She was so relieved to know her mom was ok. Just little things like that mean so much to them.  I want to Thank God for helping me to get to the jail tonight and helping me to be able to walk in. The parking place closest to the door was even open when I got there. That was amazing too! So I am on a high again tonight. I love the Lord so much and His faithfulness to help us. All we have to do is be faithful and go, He does the rest. Please keep the women and men who are incarcerated in your prayers. They may of made mistakes, but God still loves them. They are human too.

      Today is a serious day. Sorry to those who need the humor. I have some things on my heart and I need to ask for prayer.  Last night was another AWESOME Bible Study. There were 14 there. Alot of testimonies of what God has been doing in lives. Alot of questions, looking up answers in the Bible and prayer. It is so great to see what God is doing. I have found myself needing to be fed more and more. I am going to visit another Bible study from another church tonight. I am hoping it is one where I can ask questions that I need answered. One where I can receive prayer, help, and hugs instead of always giving. I never realized how badly I need that too. Just a person to minister to me. The leader is a pastor and one I have known for several years. I am looking forward to it. I have never been involved in any other Bible study where I wasn't the "leader" or leaders helper.   Next is a prayer request. I don't know if I mentioned this on here or not. About 3 weeks ago, I found a power chair, which the people said they would hold for me for 30 days, giving me time to try to get the money for it. With all the ministry opportunitioes that are coming up, I need help to be able to go. I have been praying and praying about this. If it is God's will, I know He will supply. I have ask organizations and individuals for assistance. So far, I haven't gotten any help with the money. The 30 days will be up on Tues. So plese pray about this with me. If I don't get healed before then or I don't get a means to help me be more mobile, I will have to say no to going to those places. I got upset, (I never let anyone know this) when my son got $10.000. given to him by sponsors to buy that race car. Here I sit, needing a wheel chair just to get around more and can't get any money for that. But, I put it in God's hands. If He wants me to have it, He will have to supply the $1900.00 by next week.  I "fell off the wagon" this week. Yes, I drank 3 pepsi's. Nobody knows this except me and God until now. I have learned one thing though. I have realized when I am the weakest and where I need to rely on God more in this. When I am in pain I am so vulnerable. I fought the pain and the weakeness in my back and legs Sat. through Tues.. Monday I was hurting so badly I said heck with it and drank the pepsi's. No, it didn't help the pain at all. It made me feel worse because I drank them. I get so tired of hurting and can't do much. I know God is right here with me and He has given me the strength to press on. There are still days I want to give up. It would be so much easier. Then I look at what God has called me to do and when I see the lost people that are out there and it gives me strength to go on another day.  This is a few things that are on my heart this morning. I appreciate your prayers and agreement with me. Love You Guys a BUNCH.

      Isn't the snow beautiful? It makes everything look so clean and pure. My grandkids have built a snowman in the front yard. It kind of looks like me. Really big and round in the middle. Maybe when the sun comes out it will melt some of that excess weight off. I was going to make snow ice cream. I went out to get a bowl of snow and it had already turned yellow and brown. I used it anyway. Now I don't have to put in chocolate and butterscotch flavoring. UMMMMMMMMM.......  Oh wait a minute. I think I am in the wrong season again. I just looked outside and there is green grass and leaves on the trees. Where have I been all this time? Thats what happens when you have a dog who licks your natural curtains and you can't see outside any longer with all the slobbers on the glass. That darn dog.   I remember now. It is springtime in Indiana. It is the month of May. Oh, my memory is coming back. I was at the track last Sat. I almost peed all over myself watching my son race his new $10,000. car. I almost had a nervous breakdown when he got close to hitting the wall. Not because of him getting hurt, but because I didn't want to see the car get scratched. It says Isaiah 61 on the side and it is all shiny and bright. He better not hurt that car or scratch up the lettering!!  My memory is restored now. I remember I am going on a trip next month. I am so excited. I already have my bags packed. I have to start early in case nobody will pick me up on the highway though. I have luggage with wheels on them so that helps. I have bright orange paint to paint my thumb with so people can see me at night. I wonder how long it takes to crawl to Chicago from here? Maybe I better start now. I need to get me some new knee pads for the road. I hope I am back in time for the country and western hoedown in Aug.. TD music anyone?  I hear God calling me. I better go see what He wants with me this time. I probably messed up again and He is going to tell me about it. That seems to be the norm these days. I just can't seem to do anything right. Maybe it is that darn dog. I listen to him too much and it gets me in trouble everytime. Here poochie,poochie,poochie..............

      I debated if I should write anything today or not. I wasn't sure I wanted to after the disappointment on PBR's site. Every day, I look forward to reading his post as well as a couple others. That is my devotional time. Some people have those little devotional books for each day, I have the blogs. I combine it with prayer and Bible reading. I will dare to say this, it will probably be quite awhile before PBR writes again, if ever. I can't blame him at all.  This has helped me and others tremendously the last several months. To get things out in the open. To be real and honest. To be able to ask for prayer and know that people are praying. To get advice, help, and support. A place to come to when there isn't anyone else to go to. My extended family and friends when I can't get to church, etc. Then stuff happens like it did on PBR's comments.  In the past, I have been involved in lengthy discussions also. I have hurt people and stirred up things. I haven't done that any more. I learned from that mistake. I have learned alot about people on here and also about myself. I have made friends on here that I never would of known before. If this community of people falls apart, we will all be right back where we were to begin with. None of this would of meant a thing except to pass time during the winter and to make enemies in some peoples lives.   I hope that PBR keeps writing. I could care less about the comments to be honest. They were good when we could see others thoughts about different subjects. Then there has to be fire starters who just want to cause disruption and sit back and laugh. They get their kicks by getting under someones skin. I know there are a few of the blog sites I won't visit any longer. If that is what they call "Christian" I don't need any part of them. If they want to think that to be born again, cleansed by the blood of Jesus, made in the image of God, a new creation, etc. is to act and talk like some do, then more power to you. I hope to see you in heaven. I don't need any part of you or your so called, Christianity, here.   If people are bored, I can give you several things you could be doing that will be effective for the Kingdom of God. Some wouldn't even require you to leave your computer or your home. Some wouldn't require you to go any different places than you do weekly already. Then you can get on here and tell what God is doing and how people are touched by the Holy Spirit, in the comment sections of the blogs. That way, nobody will be hurt and God will get the praise and glory. Then comment sections wouldn't have to be eliminated.  I look forward to comments.

      Today is the 11th day without drinking a pop! I almost "fell of the wagon" yesterday. I was so mad at my body and there was a 12 pack of pepsi in the kitchen. I had told my husband if he wanted pop, go ahead and get it. If I couldn't stop with it being around me, then I couldn't stop at all. I hadn't even had any desire for any until yesterday. But, Thank God, I overcame it by prayer and didn't drink!  I began to change my eating habits Monday. I refuse to say the "D" word. I am making lifestyle changes, not "D******". It has been 5 days (Well, if you count the days without the pop, it has been 11 days), toward my goal of losing 100 lbs. so I will get the cruise! I couldn't resist this morning. I had to weigh myself. I only have 96 more lbs to go!! I have lost 4 lbs.!! I had to get off the scales and back on to make sure they were going the right way! So I am headed in the right direction! I pray every day for God to help me with this and He has helped me through the temptations. I have eaten alot of fruit and veggies, protein, very little carbs, and have drank water, YUCK! I still hate water! But the main thing is, I am going in the right direction! Thank You Jesus!  I am praying that as I lose weight, I will be able to do more. I know it isn't going to make any difference with the nerve problems or the spine problems. That is going to take a miracle from God to fix those but I know I will feel better. I get out of breath alot with the weight so I know it will help that part tremendously. Also my chloresterol (sp) and blood pressure. So even if my "moving parts" won't be affected by this, overall physically, it will help. So please keep me in your prayers. All I want to do is to go out and do what God has called me to do. I don't want to let Him down. He has done so much for me. (Also, to go on that cruise! Is that of the world? No. I think there is spiritual for sure!)  I got a little report on the Bible study Wed. When they heard I wouldn't be there, some went crazy. They were telling me they didn't know what to do, etc. I told them that was good. Just let GOD do what HE wants to do! There were still 11 there and I was told it went well. They didn't have a ministry time like we have been having, but that was ok. Some had questions that got help with them. One couple ask if it was ok if they go to our church. So hopefully, they will be there Sunday. Last Sun. there were 9 adults and 9 kids there from our Bible study. Maybe this week we will take up another pew! It was awesome when we all went up for communion. I didn't even know if the "new" ones knew about communion. Then this week, my son has hired 2 of the men to work for us. They are so excited. One of the men was only making $250. every 2 weeks. God is so good!  God is working big time. Don't miss out!

      Thought I better write something. This hasn't been a very good week. I missed jail Monday night. Then I missed Bible Study last night. I am soooo sick and tired of being sick and tired.   All I can say is, God is Faithful. He has been with me, talking to me and carrying me the last few days. Another busy weekend is at hand and I am not sure I am ready for it. Although, I know God is my strength. He hasn't let me down yet and I know He won't now.  I am looking forward to our trip to Chicago in a month. I haven't been away in almost a year and I am past due for a trip. There are 5 of us going for 3 days. It will be a great time of refreshing and refilling of the Holy Spirit. Which is desperately needed at this point.  Hope everyone has a good week and weekend. Will write more later.

      This has been a great Mothers Day so far. My daughter in law gave me the gift card from Starbucks at church this morning that she won. She hates coffee. She won't even keep any at her house for me and her mom! So that was a blessing! Next, I don't know what has gotten into my husband. He took me out Thurs. to my favorite place to eat, Texas Roadhouse. He said that was my Mothers Day gift. Then I came home from feeding the homeless Sat. and there was a big pot of flowers for me from him. Thank You Jesus! I can handle this!! Something is up. He NEVER does anything like this!   In addition to all this, I was telling him how I was starting to work on my weight. I have to do what I can do to help my body BEFORE God is going to do anything. I have neglected my part just waiting for the manifestation of my healing to come. God told me the other day that I needed to do my part FIRST. I have started by quitting the pop. It has been 7 days without as much as a sip of any kind! Hallelujah!! Monday, I am going to start watching what I eat. I am making a total lifestyle change. My husband then said to me, "If you lose 100 lbs. I will take you on a cruise next year". That is 1st on my list of "want to do" things in my life. I am in awe of this man lately. I think God is clearly speaking to him!! Prayer DOES work!!! So keep praying for me. I need all the help and support I can get!! Then I will send all of you a post card from the Carribean or Jamaica or somewhere! ;oD  Yesterday I was having one of those "spells" that sent me to the ER last Aug. I fought through it and went to feed the homeless anyway. It began to wear off soon after we got there. It is a scary feeling and I was afraid to drive but had no choice. God definately was with me and gave me strength to go. Thanks for your prayers then as well. I was home about 1 hour and left again for the track. It was a beautiful night and just the right temperature. I got to talk to a few people about Jesus too. Everyone was safe while racing and I finally got home about midnight. I even made it to church this morning!  There was a salvation when we were on the street with the homeless Sat. I also got to talk to several people and pray with some. It was so good. I am planning on going to the jail tomorrow night. It will be the first time in about 5 months. There is 11 steps that go into the jail. That is what I am worried about. But I am going if I have to take 2 steps at a time and sit down.  Two of the new couples that are in our Bible study did visit our church today. It was great when all of us went up for communion. God is so good and I still stand in amazement at times.   I think that is all the update. I am going to rest the remainder of the day. My body is getting very tired and drained. In order for me to keep going, with the lupus, I have to make myself take time out rest. I am so thankful for all of you and the prayers and support you have given me since these blogs began. You guys are all "GOOD STUFFS"!

      It is a sunny and warm day! The races will be on tonight. I am excited this year. I hated racing up until a couple weeks ago. Go figure. God does change hearts. Again, I am excited to see what He has planned in all this!  The cookout was good. It was windy and a little cold. People didn't stay too long. We had some good conversation about Jesus anyway. The one man didn't bring the satanic bible. He said he couldn't find it. He thinks his wife has given it to her brother who is still in the cult. He is doing better after the incident of the police finding the girl dead behind his house. He lives in an apt. complex and it was behind the building he lives in. So sad.  The one guy who we prayed for Wed. about his anger said he was doing so good. He said he feels so full of the Lord since Wed. and the anger is gone. He will be racing tonight. He told me all he has written on his car to glorify the Lord. That is what it is all about! By the way, all of these are suppose to come to CFC, Knightstown, tomorrow for church! I am excited about that too.  Just a quick update. I wasn't going to write anything today but wanted to remind everyone to keep praying. Physically, I am not doing to well today. I am really weak and the nerves in my legs are going crazy again. It is going to be a very long day today but my strength comes from the Lord.

      I am later than usual writing today. I have been trying to just rest and relax to prepare for tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Monday. I wanted to remind all of you to please be praying. I know God is my strength and I am leaning on Him for it.   Also be praying for the one man who is in our group that has been in the satanic cult. He went home on Wed. after group, and there were all kinds of police at his home. They had found a girl, who had overdosed on oxyconton(sp?) and was dead behind his house. I don't know the details, if she was actually in their yard or in an alley or at the house behind them. All I know it was behind his home. I will find out more tonight. He was upset and went back to my son's house. His wife had forgotten her purse anyway, but they stayed until midnight, before they would go back home. He is suppose to bring his satanic bible to the cookout so we can all burn it together.  I went to the courthouse plaza in Greenfield yesterday for the National Day of Prayer. It was sad to see that there was only about 70 people there. I never counted but there were so few to the number of people that now live in this county alone. The weather was perfect. The sun was shinning and there was a breeze. I prayed and prayed before I got there that there would be a parking place close because I can't walk. I almost didn't go because of that. I just assumed that there would be a huge crowd there and no place to park. I miss so much because of the walking problem. When I got there, there was a parking place right there where I could get out and take a few steps and sit in the grass. Right where it was being held. God answered that prayer. It was just so sad that more people didn't show up. It was a great prayer time for our officials and our country. From the county all the way to the nation. I hope wherever you are that you participated in the Day of Prayer as well.  Well, I am off to the cookout. I am excited to see what God has in store for tonight and this weekend. I know I just have to be faithful and go and He will do the rest! Just like the parking place for the prayer time. I have assumed so much in the past and allowed it to stop me from just going and missed God moving in powerful ways. I know I will have wonderful reports and probably prayer requests from it all.   Have a wonderful weekend in Jesus!

      We had a wonderful "group" (I really can't call it Bible Study any longer) last night. We had 15 adults again, and 2 new ones! There is alot of demonic oppression in 2 of the couples lives. That has seemed to be the focus the last 2 weeks and the way the prayer time has gone. We had the annointing oil out again. One of the guys who wasn't prayed for last week, ask for prayer this week. He was knocked on the floor. I don't think he knew what happened! He sat there for a long time saying, "I don't think I can get up"! After awhile he began telling us how he felt the anger and resentment was gone. He said he felt so light and so free. Praise The Lord!  One of the guys that has been in a satanic cult, has been ministering to another man who is still involved in it. This other guy is very curious about what has been going on in the group and was suppose to be there last night but backed out. Hopefully, he will come soon. The guy that has been coming, still has some of the satanic things in his house. He is suppose to bring the things, especially the satanic bible, and burn them. Hopefully at the cookout tomorrow night. A few of the others have things as well they are suppose to bring. What a time we are going to have watching the devil BURN! One thing about tomorrow night is, my husband and a few other "unsaved" people are suppose to be there! It is so awesome to watch God work. It always amazes me!  Please keep praying for me. I am struggling physically more than I ever have. Today is an "off" day so I will just rest. The next 4 days I will be on the go. Sat. I will go feed the homeless and then go right to the track. That will be a very long and full day. God is my strength in it all. He hasn't failed me yet.  Thought for the day: Do chickens have lips?

      As I read Pastor Bills blog this morning, it sounded so sad. I was up very early, 4:30am, but I knew better than to come on here! My husband already thinks I am hooked on this. SHHHHHHHHHH....I think I am but don't tell him!  Tonight is Bible Study night. I am excited to see what God has in store this week. Last week was so awesome. We are suppose to have 2 more people this week. That will make our group 17 if everyone shows up. I lost count of all the kids! It is so exciting to think just a month ago it was falling apart and going to end. Look what God has done! 2 of the new couples want to visit CFC this Sun. They have been going to a church in New Castle.   Looks like the weather will hold out on the "mission field",(race track), for Sat. So keep praying. This Sat. we also go feed the homeless. Then I AM going back to the jail on Mon., somehow.  Fri. evening is a big cookout at my sons house. I am sure the "new" Christians (you know those UNchurchy people!) will also be there, so I am looking forward to that. Especially since my husband will be there and will be hearing what is said! God is going to get him yet! HALLELUJAH!!!!!  THANK YOU JESUS!!!!  What a day and time to be living in. I heard something the other day that I had never heard before. The book of Acts is the only book in the NT that doesn't "end". There is no final doxology, remarks, Amens, etc. This guy said that WE are still writing the book of Acts is why there is no ending. That was so awesome. We are writing verse after verse every day. WOW.  Today is day 3 without any kind of pop. It is amazing that I haven't had any desire or temptation for any. No withdrawls either. God is so good.   Guess, that is about the extent of my thoughts for this morning. Please keep praying for me. I HAVE learned from the past, those repeated wilderness experiences, those deep paths around that same mountain, that the worse things get, the closer the breakthrough. The pain in my back and legs is getting worse. The numbness, tingling and weakness is trying to keep me down more and more. It only gets better if I DON'T MOVE AROUND for a few days. Yeah, right!! With all the things coming up the rest of this week and weekend, I will fight to keep going. I KNOW this is all temporary and by the stripes of Jesus I AM healed. I will NOT be defeated in this. Someway, somehow, I will continue to go to the lost and tell them the good news of Jesus. The devil is a liar and I have the victory in Jesus.    Love all you guys BUNCHES!!  Have a blessed day. you are all in my prayers.

      First, I have to PRAISE THE LORD! It has been approximately 38 hours and I have not had any kind of pop whatsoever! I haven't even had a desire for any or any "withdrawl" symptoms! Now, THAT IS GOD! I believe I have lost 120 lbs too!!!!   I have been thinking about faith and prayer. It is just as easy to believe as it is to not believe. It is all a matter of our thinking and what we fill our minds with. The Bible says that we will have whatever we ask. All we have to do is believe or in other words, have faith. I totally believe that to be true. I have seen it happen over and over in my life. There is one thing about this though, there have been things that I ask for that didn't come to pass. So what is the difference? I had the faith for it to happen. So why didn't God answer those prayers too?  Mark 11:23-24 I have prayed and believed for people to be healed, only to see them die. My half sister was one of those last year. If she was healed, that would of been such a testimony to so many people who would of probably gotten saved. I laid hands on her, just like the Bible said. I annointed her with oil, just like the Bible said. I prayed and believed she would be healed of cancer, yet she died. Although, she did give her heart to Jesus before she died. So is the scripture not true that says, all we have to do is ask and believe and it will come to pass? Or is it only for "some" people and not everyone? Does God pick and choose? Is our life like russian roulette? Maybe God will and maybe God won't?  I feel that particular scripture is true as long as the situation I am praying about and believing for is for me (you) personnally. For my own healing. For my own finances. For my own soul. I don't believe that  scripture is meant for me to believe for another person. This is where so many people "get mad at God". Or think that the Bible isn't true because so and so didn't get healed, etc. We prayed in faith and done all the right things that God told us to do, but it didn't happen. Why?  I believe that we can pray for another person until we are blue in the face and sweating great drops of blood like Jesus did, and our prayer will still go unanswered, if the person we are praying for does not have the faith, themselves, to receive. God will not go against the other persons will. Example. I have a neice who has had CP all her life. She ask for prayer. I have prayed and believed for her to be healed, etc. One day she made the comment to me that she didn't want to be healed because she would lose her Social Security and then have to go to work. Another instance, I prayed for a person to be healed and in the meantime they were planning their funeral arangements and getting things in order "in case" they died. One other case is a lady I know, her husband has cancer. They are both Christians. This is the second time he has had it. They have ask me to pray both times which I have been. We were talking the other day about healing. Her comment was this, "But the Dr. says..........". So that shows me their faith is in the Dr. and not in God. So I don't care how much I pray and believe, he will probably die anyway. It all depends on what the other person is confessing and believing. I have seen God do miraculous things for other people as well. It was only because they were confessing and believing for themselves. Not because of me confessing and believing, for them, to get whatever I ask. Our faith was combined in agreement, and God moved.   I use to get all upset when I prayed for people and I didn't get what I had ask. God revealed this to me and now I pray that the person who I am praying for has the faith to be healed, that they have done all God has instructed them to do, so we can be in agreement, and it will come to pass. I also have learned that it is selfish to want a person to live if they want to go on and be with Jesus, if they are saved. Then there are times that God will intervene in a persons life, to get them to open their eyes and be saved.  I know this has set me free and has changed the way I pray for people and myself. I do want to add this, what I have written is MY thoughts and beliefs. This is what God has shown me. I know there are going to be those who read this and don't agree and that is OK. I know there are those who will say, "but so and so......", that is ok too. This is MY beliefs. It has been on my heart and I felt I needed to share it. Maybe I am totally wrong. If I am hopefully someone can set me straight! I am always willing to change and learn.

      First I want to thank all of you for praying for me. I am some better today. I can walk a little better. I laid and rested all day yesterday and will do the same today. That seems to be the only way to get over these flare ups with the nerves in my back and legs. I had been feeling pretty good last week (and high!) and pushed myself too far, "again". The doctors told me with lupus I have to listen to my body but I don't hear too well. I haven't heard it "say" anything yet. Do they really know what they are talking about?  I spent the time yesterday with the Lord so it was good. You know I don't like church anyway and all those churchy people with their weird music! Oh Geesh.....I forgot. At midnight one night, I turned into one of those churchy people too. I guess that explains why I missed everyone so badly yesterday! Lord help me!!!! I have crossed over the "point of no return".  Beginning today, I am making some lifestyle changes. The first one is I have drank my last Pepsi! I ran out last night. PLEEEEEASE PRAY! Is there any Pepsi anonymous around along with bloggers anonymous? I am determined to take off some of this weight. It isn't going to help the physical problems I have, only God can do that, but I will look better in a grass skirt next time! Dr. Phil, Dr. Adkins, Richard Simmons, Jack LaLayne (oh geesh, that told my age!), can you help me?????????  Seriously, I want to leave everyone with this thought, does the light in the refrigerator really go off when you shut the door?

      Opening Day at the track was cancelled due to rain. So it will be next Sat. I was looking forward to it too. I guess it was because I was looking at it in a whole new perspective this year, as a mission field instead of "the track". Oh well. Got an extra week to pray up. Have a  wonderful Sunday everyone.

      It's Sat. morning. I feel like I have been beaten and ran over with a Mac truck! I have been out alot this week. It is really good after a winter of hybernating. Most of what I have done has been ministry/church oriented. Oh GEESH, here I go again. That definately makes me a "hula, biker chic, churchy person". I was with a group of women at a church last night. We played this game called "Crossfire". I haven't laughed that much in a long time. It was really great for my spirit. The bad thing is, I had to come home, to reality, when it was over.  God has put so much on my heart and I hate waiting. I want it NOW. I want to see things happen NOW. I know I am the only one like this! God gave me a vision almost 3 years ago of this transitional house. I have had prophecies about it, comfirmations, etc. I KNOW what God said that morning. There is no doubt in my mind it is in the process even though it sure don't look possible. I know how God works and I know it is coming. The only thing, I need it or maybe I should say, WANT IT, NOW!   I watched TBN after I got home last night and the LA Dream Center came on. I sat there in tears. That is exactly what God showed me only on a much smaller scale. I have watched this for years but last night it hit me harder when I saw it. The burden for this seemed so much heavier. I have always said it would be called Isaiah 61 transitional house but God spoke to me last night and said "Isaiah 61 Dream Center".   God has resurrected Isaiah 61. There for a few months, I had given up. Isaiah 61 was over. It was a thing of the past or so I thought. God was just changing me and preparing me for what was ahead. I heard a young boy speak the other night about between the time that God gives you a vision or a promise, and when it actually comes to pass, there is a process, a preparation period. If we would get it immediately, we wouldn't appreciate it as much. The longer we have to wait, the longer the process takes, the more we will appreciate the promise or vision, when it comes.    I thought about the 3 specific things that God has promised me that hasn't come to pass. 1) My famlies salvation 2) My healing 3) The transitional house, (Dream Center). These are 3 promises that He has spoken directly to me about. It hasn't been just a couple weeks ago, I have been waiting years. I get down at times but God will always bring a confirmation through someone or something, that will encourage me to keep standing firm and wait.  I want to encourage any of you that have been waiting for a promise God has given you, to stand firm. It may look impossible, It may look like God has forgotten about it. You may think you just heard God wrong. You may want to just forget about it and give up. Hold on. The longer it takes, the more powerful it will be and the more you will appreciate it. The process isn't fun at all but it is well worth it. I KNOW I am in the process of being healed. I have to stay faithful no matter what I have to do to continue. If I have to crawl, I have to continue to go to the places God has called me to go and be a witness for Jesus. I know my family is in the process of being saved no matter how bad it looks or what they are doing right now. I know Isaiah 61 Dream Center is in the process of becoming a reality no matter if someone else did buy the property that God specifically showed me. I know what God has promised and I know God will bring it all to pass. I have to stand firm and keep the faith and vision. I also have learned from past experiences, the worse it looks, the harder the storm, when I am at that point I don't think I can hold on any longer, the breakthrough is at hand. It is in the time where we are the weakest and giving up. It is when we feel we can't go on any longer, that God shows up. How many times we have been at the point of seeing the promise fulfilled, the next hour it would come to pass, but we gave up. We gave in because it was too hard, we was too weak, and didn't feel like we could go on any longer. I have done that. I have been at the point of seeing my breakthrough or the promise fulfilled, but gave up right before it happened.  So stand firm no matter how hard it is. No matter how weak you may be. God's promises will always come to pass. He is the One who NEVER fails.

      For quite awhile now, God has put on my heart to go to the streets more. I knew I wasn't able to do that, physically. Since God provided me with the power chair, I can go. The burden for those people has gotten stronger the last 6 weeks and I can't shake it. So I know it is God saying, "GO". I can do it now!  I love to be around the "Throw Away People" of society. As you all know by now, my heart is evangelism. I LOVE the people that so many others just don't want to be around or may be scared of. I guess it could come from me growing up around "those kind" and living my teen-young adult life as one. There isn't a whole lot that scares me.  I know what God done in my life so I know there is hope for all of them. I don't care how drunk, high, dirty, etc. etc. they are, I want to hold them and let them know that there is people out here that do care and that Jesus loves them. I am ready to start going back into the bar and having Bible Study also. I really miss that on Friday night. Those people in there are so real. They don't pretend to be someone they aren't.  I love Jesus so much today. He has done so much for me and all I want to do is just give back to him what I can. I know there is nothing I can do that could ever repay Him but the least I can do is share His love with others.    The hardest thing for me to do is live around unsaved family members. I know how Jesus felt when His family looked down their noses at Him. The doubt and unbelief that they had. It hurts and there is nothing that I can do to change them except pray. God has promised that what I make happen for others, He will make happen for me. I stand on that promise and one day it will come to pass.

      I am in awe of God this afternoon. He never ceases to amaze me. He is so womderful. For the second week in a row, my youngest son and his family have been in church. They had stopped going for quite awhile. I know God is going to bring my middle son, his wife and my husband back as well. He promised me in Acts 16:31!  The last few weeks, there have been alot of questions about dreams in our Bible Study. I had a set of tapes about dreams and visions. So I thought I would listen to them, take notes and then share them in the Bible study. I have had a couple dreams myself, I would like to know the meaning of. I want to share them with you.  The first dream was my husband was driving a bus. He was acting crazy, I mean, literally insane. It was a yellow bus, so I assume it was a school bus. I was running down the sidewalk beside it trying to get him to stop. He was acting so weird. A lady in our church was riding on the bus with him. She was just sitting there with no concern to what was happening. Then I woke up. This was about a year ago and I haven't forgotten it. There have been times when my husband acts like he is crazy and I look around for that yellow bus! Just kidding!  The interpretation of this dream, according to the tapes I have been listening to would be this. You first see where you are in the dream. If you are watching events happen, if you are with others, participating the event or if you are the focus of the dream. In this case, I was with others. Any kind of transportation, bike, car, truck, bus, semi, plane, etc. would be a symbol for your ministry. The larger the vehicle, the larger the ministry. So the bus would be a pretty big ministry. Color is important. It was a yellow bus. Yellow is the symbol for fear. School bus would be a symbol for education. So here is what I get out of this dream. Whether it is correct or not, I don't really know but it does give me hope!  My husband gave his life to the Lord. This would be the "crazy" part. He was sold out to God and was "out of his mind"! He was fearful but he started a bus ministry, picking people up to take them to be educated. I was trying to get him to slow down because he was going faster than I was and I couldn't keep up. His ministry was getting ahead of me. I think I was the one who was doing the educating or discipling. He was picking them up and taking them to me. This would all seem very possible with the Dream Center I have on my heart to begin. So who but God knows what is about to happen!  The next dream, I had only a couple weeks ago. I was running and there was a bunch of yellow jacket bees on me. They were covering me. I was trying to yell for help but I couldn't yell. I saw this pond and I knew if I jumped in the water, the bees would drown. I jump in but I couldn't go under the water. It was deep but I lay on my stomach and only about half of me was in the water. It was like a wall of something stopping me from being able to get my whole body in it.  I was the focus of the dream here so it is about me. Bees are a symbol of demons. So I was being attacked by several demons, in all areas of my life, because they covered me. I couldn't yell symbolizes that I have not spent enough time in prayer. The water represents the Holy Spirit. The more water, i.e. sink, bathtub, pool, stream, river, pond, lake, sea, ocean, the more of the Holy Spirit you have in your life. A pond isn't a big body of water so I wasn't filled very much with the Holy Spirit and I couldn't fight off all the demons. I needed to pray more and be filled more with the Spirit. To be able to do more spiritual warfare and to be delivered from the demonic oppression. This fits exactly where I am at right now. So I think this dream interpretation is right on.  This study has been awesome. As I said, I don't know if all the symbols he gives on these tapes are right or not but I do know that the dream about the bees would hit me right between the eyes.

      It's hard to believe it has been a week since I was in Chicago. It hasn't been a very good week. I have just wanted to sit and cry. I guess that is what happens when you have to come back to reality. Back to the real world. I want to pray, "God just take me home. I don't want to be here any longer."  I know God is still with me. I know He is hearing me crying out to Him. It is so different having to be home and not in that awesome presence of God and with others who know Him. I hate living in this world. I hate the confusion. I hate having to live with people who don't know Jesus. Who don't have that inner peace of knowing Him. The worrying, the hopelessness, the seemingly unending struggling, that they don't have to go through. People going here and there. Constantly on the go. Seeking. Searching. Not accepting the fact all they need is Jesus. He is the only One who will fill that emptiness, that void, they are trying to fill by the worlds means.  Lord, help me to keep my focus on you, the unseen, and not the things that are seen.

      Day 3 (con't)    Pat and the other lady that went had been telling me all day to not resist God that night. To receive what He had for me. I still had that feeling in the pit of my stomach that would not go away. The service began and I sat there feeling so awful for what I had done the night before and had caused Pat to almost lose her miracle. My brother who was sitting next to me just kept talking and jabbing me with his elbow to look at what was going on with different people. The longer I sat there, the worse I felt. When the worship began, I got my list of names out again. I tried praying but I couldn't. My brother just kept jabbing me with his elbow, wanting me to watch what was going on around us. I wanted to slap him and tell him to LEAVE ME ALONE. I finally said to myself, "Just forget it. I already blew it. I am not going to get anything." So I sat there just watching everyone else.   The man came back to Pat and ask if she wanted to go up on stage and testify to what God had done. She said she would and took the lady who went with us. I was excited for her. They both got holy laughter while they were on stage. Pat was running across the stage swinging her cane above her head. The whole arena was laughing. It was awesome. I sat there thinking to my self, "I really missed God this time". When they were finished on stage, I told my brother I was going on out to the van. They could stay as long as they wanted. I knew it would be awhile before Pat would be finished. There is a long process afterwards they go through. I couldn't stay in there any longer. So I went out, in tears.  I began crying out to God. I had blown it. I had rejected Him. I had been disobedient and He was upset with me. I was repenting and begging God to not leave me because I had been so stupid. I just knew that the feeling I had in my stomach was where the Holy Spirit had left me. I felt empty now and it was all because of me. This went on for about a half an hour then God spoke. He said, "Donna, I love you. I am still with you. You were not disobedient nor did you reject me. All you done was just fail to receive the gift I had for you. You were obedient and witnessed to those people I put in your path before the service. You will have another opportunity and you will be healed. The feeling you have in your stomach is from you sacrificing your healing, wanting others to be healed instead. The annointing that was on you to be healed transfered to others and they were healed." Right then, that feeling left and I felt like a warm blanket wrap around me.   I learned so much in this trip. Things I knew but had never experienced. When the man laid his hands on my hands on the list of names I took, he also prayed for healing to be in my hands. I felt heat when he said that. I heard that one of the people who's name was on there, was in very bad shape that week and it was touch and go for awhile. Then, he had a visitation from Jesus! I am waiting to hear from others on how God touched them.  Since the trip, physically, I have been in more pain than usual. I know my time is coming and until then, I will be obedient to witness and minister as God wants, however I have to do it. Seek the Healer and not the healing. Seek the Provider and not the provision. When we get our focus off ourselves and onto Jesus, worshipping Him, miracles happen. Reach out and touch the hem of His garment (receive) and He will make you whole. He Promised! It is already done!

      Before I write the final part of Day 2, I want to add this.I hesitated telling this story because of reactions I may get. I am not boasting about what I done to make myself look "holier than thou". I learned a big lesson and I wanted to share it with others. How we can reject the gift that Christ paid for, for us, that day. It is so easy to receive from the Lord that we tend to think it isn't real. We think we have to go through certain "rituals", say certain words, work at it and then "hope" that we are the ones God picks to heal or bless in any way. Receiving from God is so simple that we can't accept that. We tend to think it has to be complicated or it can't be real. This may be from our being raised hearing "If it sounds to good to be true, it probably isn't true". Also, "We must work hard to achieve anything in this world". So we have allowed that to spill over into our spiritual lives as well. I will add this; I do believe, in most cases, there is a process. Not everything is instant. What I am saying, it is there for the asking. Everything has already been provided for us. All we have to do is receive it.  Day 2 (con't)     After the man had prayed for me and I refuses to receive the healing, I felt something really strange in the pit of my stomach. I can't describe what it felt like. It was like a gnawing, empty, twisting, funny feeling. As we were driving back to the motel, I felt this urge that I had to confess what I done. So I laid it all out to Pat and the other lady that was with us. I felt so bad. I just knew I had been disobedient to God and had rejected the Holy Spirit. I just knew that because of my disobedience, that God would not hear the prayers for those I had on the list. I wanted to crawl in a hole and die. We talked about what I had done. Was it disobedience? Did I grieve the Holy Spirit? Did I reject what Jesus done for me? I felt so dirty. So worthless. So ashamed.  After we got back to the motel, we sat and prayed and talked until 3am. We looked up scriptures to try to figure out if God was mad at me for not being obedient. Or was it really disobedience?  Day 3 We were up at 8am. I didn't sleep very well. My brother and his wife didn't know anything about all of this. I hadn't told him and I wasn't going to. That is a WHOLE OTHER STORY! I still had that feeling in my stomach. It just wouldn't go away. I had taken juice and crackers for communion and I knew that was what we needed to do before we even left the motel that morning. So we all got together and prayed and had communion.  We were at the arena about 2pm. The doors opened at 3pm. Again, thousands of people with all kinds of sickness and diseases were already in line. Some crippled, some paralized, some with all kinds of tubes in them, etc. After we went in and got our place to sit, I couldn't sit there. My brother is one who talks quite a bit and I just couldn't sit there and listen for the next 4 hours. Since I have my power chair, I didn't have to depend on anyone to push me, so Pat and I went out to the main level of the arena. We went around looking at the product tables and different things in there. We finally got something to eat and I went to the side, to eat and Pat went back down to where we were sitting. A lady from the choir had came out there and began talking to us beforehand. We had talked to her the day before also. She began laying her heart out about her husband dying a year ago from alcoholism. Then she began telling me she had lupus and all the complications she has had from that. How God has been her strength and all He has done in her life. How worthless she felt she was and God still loved her enough to heal her of so many things. We talked for a long time until she had to go back in to practice. While I was sitting there eating, a man came over to where I was sitting. I spoke to him and ask him where he was from. He said New Palestine, Indiana. The same county I live in! He began telling me that he couldn't believe he was actually at a Benny Hinn Crusade, etc. Then he began laying his heart out about how he drinks and it is so bad at times he doesn't go home. After awhile I offered to pray with him, then he left.  I still had that feeling in my stomach. Nothing was making it go away. Why was God sending these people to me to listen to and pray for? What was going on? Here I was, not feeling like a very good person, let alone a Christian, after rejecting Him the night before, yet these people coming to me and just start laying their hearts out. God, I don't understand. What is happening here?  Day 3 will be continued tomorrow!

      I am going to tell about Day 2 in Chicago in two parts. Part One will be today. This is a hard one to write and I pray it will be something all of you can learn from. It was something that I already knew in my mind. When I actually done it and experienced it, it became so clear to me. I knew it was the Truth for sure.  Day 2 After seeing the movie, The Passion of the Christ, I can't ask Jesus to heal me any longer. He took 39 stripes on His back for my healing. If I ask Him to heal me, I am asking Him to take those stripes and the beating again. I can't do that. One time was enough. It was finished then and by His stripes we are already healed. It is up to us to receive the healing by using our faith. Here is an example. I went out and bought you a book. I came to you and held it out for you to take. The book is your but you have to reach out and take it with your hand. You can stand there, look at it, confess it is yours, know it is yours, but until you actually reach out and grasp it and take it from my hand, you will not physically have it. It still belongs to you. It is still a free gift to you. But untill you take it, you will not benefit from it. The same with healing. Jesus already done all He is going to do to provide us with our healing. It is up to us to reach out and take it by faith. Salvation is the same way. Jesus is not going to come back and die and rise again for each of us to receive salvation. It is already finished. It is done. The choice is ours, either to accept or reject it. God is not going to save anyone today nor is He going to heal anyone today. He already has. The ball is in our ball park now.  I took a list of names with me of those who needed healing. Some have had the "death sentence" given to them. Most of them are in worse physical shape than I am. Before I went, I had already decided wasn't going to receive a healing myself. I just wanted to be in the presence of God and to be refilled with the Holy Spirit. I wanted those on my list to receive. I wanted all those who were there, that were in such bad shape, to receive a miracle. I have been healed several times of different things. Twice was at a Benny Hinn Crusade. I don't have life threatening health problems and I can live with what I have. My heart was for those who don't have any other hope except God. I wanted God to touch them.  As we sat in line waiting for the doors to open, I saw all the precious people who were so ill. People on stretchers. People in wheel chairs. Men, women, children, all ages, all kinds. All different diseases and conditions. When we were inside waiting for the service to begin, I sat and prayed for all those around me. I felt guilty on the inside for even being there. I held my prayer book and the list of names the whole time I was there. The message that Benny Hinn gave was on receiving your healing. It was just the way that I believe. He said that God was not going to save anyone that night nor was He going to heal anyone that night. He already has. It is up to us to just reach out and receive. Get out our focus off of ourselves and others and just worship Him. Forget about everything else except Jesus. All we have to do is reach out and touch the hem of His garment. Just receive what has already been done for us.       After awhile the worship began. The atmosphere changed to this electrifying presence. I sat there with the prayer book and list of names, holding them up to the Lord. I had my eyes closed and just entering into the presence of God that was so awesome. I had cleared my mind of everything except Jesus. I laid my hand on the list of names I took and began to pray in tongues over them. I could feel the power of God all around me. Then someone came and laid hands on me and ask what was wrong with me. I told him I had lupus. He began to pray. I could feel something happening inside of me. That is when I began telling God that I didn't want to be healed. Heal all those on the list I had and all those who were in worse shape than I was who were there. I kept telling Him, "Not me. Touch the others". The man ask if I felt any different. I was ashamed to tell him that I didn't want the healing and that was what I was praying, so I said, "Some". He prayed for me awhile longer. Then he saw the list I had my hand on and he laid his hand on it and prayed. He then went to my friend, Pat, sitting next to me.  I will stop here for today. I will finish Day 2 tomorrow.

      I have slept about 20 hours since I returned home Sat. evening. I still think I need a few more! I want to tell about what God done on the first day. Day One I can always tell if the meeting we are going to is going to be good by the challenges we have beforehand. This trip was no exception. We left on Wed. morning and ran into so much traffic and rain. A trip that should of taken us 3 1/2 hours, took 8 hours. I had directions straight to the motel. My brother was following us and we got seperated on the interstate in Chicago. He had the address of the motel but that was all. We got to the motel fine but my brother was lost. I went on in to check in. I had made reservations through Hotels.com 2 months prior and had paid in advance for our rooms. The receptionist told me that there was no reservations there for me. I gave her my confirmation paper and she shook her head. She said they no longer accept reservations through Hotels.com. That they no longer have a contract with them. They had cancelled that over 2 months before.  She got the manager and he told me that they had rooms available but I would have to pay again for them. I tried to convince him that it wasn't my fault that hotels.com made the reservations and wasn't suppose to. He kept telling me that I would have to call them and get my money back and they would give me a hard time about it. He said he had seen this alot of times before. I told him that we couldn't pay again and that it should be him against hotels.com and not me. He still wouldn't listen! By the way, I did hold my cool. Now that was the first "miracle" God done!  My brother still hadn't showed up at the motel. I went back out to the others that I was with and told them the situation. I then called hotels.com on my cell phone and gave them the info. They put me on hold and I was disconnected. GRRRRRRR. I called my neice to get my brothers cell phone number to see where he was at. She gave it to me but told me that he doesn't keep it on so he probably won't answer. I called and he never answered it. One of the ladies that I was with said, "Let's just pray". We prayed for God to intervene in this motel situation and also that my brother would answer his phone. When we finished, I tried to call him again and he answered. He then told me that he never turned the phone on. That was the second thing God done!  We decided that maybe if all 3 of us went into the motel and talked to the manager, we could get our rooms. So we all went in. Still the manager wouldn't hear of it. He said it was between us and hotel.com. He had to have more money if we wanted to stay there. While we were trying to convince him that it wasn't the customers fault, the phone rang. The receptionist ask me if I was Donna Stephens. I said yes. She said that hotels.com was on the phone and wanted to talk to me. A man on the other end was apologizing for all the mess up and told me that they were going to put us in the Marriot and they would pay all the extra costs. He took all the info and made the reservations. About that time, my brother came in the door. Thank God he wasn't there while all this was going on. He is one who would tear the roof off a place in a situation like that. So I know now it was God that got them lost so he wouldn't be there! That was the third thing God done!    The Marriot was only 2 miles from where we were. When we got there we were treated like royality! It was alot nicer motel and all expenses were paid for. This was the fourth thing God done! That goes to show you it doesn't pay to lose your temper. That was a huge lesson for me to learn. We just waited and prayed about it and God took care of it. I also learned to not use hotels.com any more although it all ended up better than it was to begin with. They did make it right with us.  That evening I met 2 ladies from the Chicago Christ Fellowship Church. We had a great time of fellowship and getting to know each other a little more. We had only met on the blogs and it was great to meet them in person! Jules and Cheryl, I love you both bunches! Thanks for the great time and all the laughs. I am taking my hula (grass) skirt to the dry cleaners so it will be clean and pressed for homecoming!  This was the first day at Chicago. God is so good and so faithful if we only trust Him and not get in the way and try to handle situations on our own. It will work out even better than it was at first.

      I'MMMMMMMM BAAAAAAAACK !!!!!!!!!!  I will be telling all about the Chicago trip over the next couple days. SOOOOOO much to tell of what God done. It all began with the motel not having our reservation. That all ended with us getting to stay at the Marriot with all the extra costs paid! I met some ladies by the names of Jules and Cheryl, that have this obsession with hula dancers. Since I was free to "roam around" the arena because of my new wheels, I got to minister to some people before the services began. My friend, Pat, was healed and was on stage giving her testimony. Holy laughter hit us the last night. I believe that there were some that were healed of the names I took with me. That is just the beginning.  I slept about 9 hours Sat. night. I went to church this morning and came home and slept another 3 hours. I am ready to go back to bed again. When I go to things like this I run on adrenaline, or however you spell it. Then when it is over, I crash. I will fill you in on the trip tomorrow. It was awesome!  Good Night!!!   ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

      Tomorrow I am leaving for Chicago. I will be going to the Benny Hinn Crusade at the United Center. I was there 2 years ago and said I would never go back to Chicago because of all the traffic. Well, guess that goes to show you never say, "never"!    I am excited just to be getting away a few days. I am taking a list of name of people who are in need of a healing to hold up to God in the service. Several have sent me the names of loved ones and I am excited to see what God is going to do in their lives.   I do want to ask all of you to be praying for Marty Hensley. Also, visit his website and encourage him through his battle with diabetes. The address is www.wherejesuscomesfirst.blogspot.com. He and his wife run the radio station WJCF 88.1. (Marty, does this count as promoting the station for the tickets?) They have supported Isaiah 61 and are a blessing to the community. Satan knows how many lives this station touches and he is trying to take Marty out. So please visit his blogsite, encourage and pray for him.  You have all been such an encouragement to me through some tough times. I thank God for all of you and I pray His blessings will increase in your lives. I need to go finish packing and get my hula skirt pressed and ready to go. Marty told me that God said if I wore my grass skirt to the crusade I would be healed! Then he remembered that it wasn't God, it was Rob White! Oh well, it would draw attention, thats for sure!  Will write when I get home. Love all of you bunches!!! You are all in my thoughts and prayers. Don't ever give up!

      I blew it this afternoon.  After church, I stopped at the gas station to get gas. I went in to pay and had to stand in line. That is the hardest thing, physically, for me to do. I noticed the cashier was crying. There were 2 other people ahead of me, When the man in front of me got to the register, he ask her if she was ok. She shook her head yes, and made a gesture with her hand as if to say, "I don't want to talk about it". I was thinking to myself that I would just ask her if I could pray for her. She didn't haveto even tell me what the problem was that God already knew. When I got to the register, I decided just not to say anything. There was a line behind me and I was hurting. The man in front of me had already ask her if she was ok and she didn't want to talk. So she would probably just tell me no too. So I didn't say anything to her. I paid for my gas and went on. Now I can't stop yelling at myself for ignoring the opportunity just because I was thinking of myself and assuming what she would say. God put a hurting person right in front of me and I ignored her. I have prayed for her ever since I left the gas station.  God gives us opportunities all the time to help people. Some of which may not be right in front of you like this was was, but they are always there. Then alot of the time we have all these excuses why we can't do anything. We can always assume what they will say or what others may say. Or be in a hurry and don't have time. Instead, we need to be looking for all those opportunities and take advantage of them when we see them.   Lord, forgive me for ignoring this lady today and not praying with her. I know it was an opportunity that you put right in front of me and I blew it because I was more concerned about how I felt and just assumed what she would say instead of saying anything. I want to be a witness for you everywhere I may be. Please forgive me and give me other opportunities to pray with and help hurting people. In Jesus Name  Amen  I am leaving Wed. for the Benny Hinn Crusade in Chicago. God has laid it on my heart to take the names of people that are in need of a healing and to hold them up to Him and pray over them while we are there. If you know of anyone, please email the names or put them on the comments before Wed.  Thanks

      What a day this has been. First I found a $50.00 bill in my wallet that I have no idea where it came from. Next, I was in court with my youngest son. Back in Feb., his car was stolen. They caught the guy who took it and his trial was today. Then I got to make another visit to WALMART!!! I used my chair and had a WONDERFUL time shopping. I bought me a few new clothes with the $50.00. God is so good!  As I sat in that courtroom this afternoon, my heart went out to that boy. He is 23 and has already been in prison once or twice. Now he is going back for 4 more years. He had only been out 5 days when he stole my son's car. There wasn't anyone there to support him. The only ones there besides us was the prosecutor, his probation officer, the judge, the deputy who brought him in and his attorney. It was so sad to see that none of his family cared enough to at least be there. So I am guessing he is probably one of those whose family has given up on him and don't want anything to do with him. You know, one of those "Throw Away People". I think I will write him a letter.  I wanted to go up to the front of that courtroom and let this boy know what Jesus would do for him. I wanted to hug him and tell him that there is someone who loves and cares for him. I wanted to tell him that he is special even though he has been on the wrong path. He is only 23 and has a record so long. Anyway, I think I am going to write to him just to let him know that Jesus loves him even if nobody else seems to.  When I got home, one of the guys that works for us came by to get his paycheck. He is another one who is into drugs, alcohol, etc. He was high on something. He made the comment that he needed alot of improvement in his life. That opened the door some for me to get a word about Jesus in. Another one of the guys that works for us is running from the law. It bothers me that we have these kinds working for us but I believe it is God's will. There are 2 new ones who are Christians and they have been witnessing to them! They do know that they don't come to work high or drinking. They will be fired on the spot. So there is a reason we draw these kinds of people to our business.  God has been speaking to me alot about starting to go out more on the streets. He has been showing me alot of things lately and it is getting exciting, yet, scary. I know the transitional house, the "Dream Center", is just around the corner. God has revealed that to me as well. So continue to pray for me and Isaiah 61. He has even put people in place to help. People that I would never of thought would do anything like this. It still amazes me when I see God do things like that.  That is my thoughts for today. Tomorrow, weather permitting, I will be at the race track. It is probably under water by now! God is so wonderful and so....................there just isn't any words to describe it!

      Lord, I don't know what is going on with me this week. For some reason I have this desperation and hunger for you, more than I have ever had. I don't want to be around other people. I don't want to be disturbed. I just want to sit in your presence and wipe your feet with my hair. I want to pour my whole being out to you and give you everything I have. Nothing else matters except that I am in your presence. Father at Bible Study last night, you heard all the prayer requests. You know what people are going through and are concerned about. I know that there is nothing impossible with you. I know that everything can change in the next second, the next minute. Some are falling away from you and my heart is broken when I see that. Some have received a word from you and are so excited that you actually talked to them. Some are just content with what they have and where they are. Lord, I want more of you. I want to go higher than I have ever been. I want to know you more and more. I don't want to stay where I am at. I want to be changed into your likeness. I don't want to live everyday in the norm. I want to be different. I want to be the person you have created me to be. I want more of you Lord and less of me. More of heaven and less of the world. Clean out of me the junk that is still in there and fill me with your Spirit to overflowing.    Touch me Holy Spirit, don't pass me by. Touch me Holy Spirit, for in you I am alive. One day when I was alone, how you set me free, lifted off that heavy burden, made me so complete. With praises of thanksgiving, I lay them at your feet, Holy Spirit, you're the difference in me.

      I have been doing a study on Dreams and Visions. This subject seems to come up alot in our Bible Study. It is very interesting to study it. Dreams are told in symbols and metaphors so we have to search out the meanings. Visions are very clearly told to us.    I remember a dream I once had. I was in an auditorium with several hundred people. The weirdest thing was, I was in my nightgown! There was another man on the stage with me. My husband was there and my oldest son, his wife and their daughter. My youngest son was going to go but he backed out at the last minute. I spoke to all the people and so did the other man. I don't know what I said. I just know that we both spoke to that auditorium full of people.  When we were finished most of the people went to another building and ate. It was the normal, chicken, mashed potatoes, corn, etc. One thing that caught my eye was there were green beans instead of the normal baked beans. I didn't think too much about that dream after that.   My half brother passed away suddenly a few years ago. I was asked to do the funeral with another man. My brother didn't want people to dress up when he died. He wanted them to be casual just like he knew them. I agreed to do it and wore casual clothes. At the funeral, there were alot of people. The funeral home was full. my husband, and my oldest son and his family were there. My youngest son was going to go but couldn't at the last minute. After the funeral was over, we went to the American Legion that my brother belonged to. They had food brought in. It was the normal food like chicken, mashed potatoes, corn, etc. Then I saw the green beans instead of baked beans. It hit me right then that I had already been told about this in a dream.  Even the nightgown was the casual clothing. I was speachless for several minutes.  I have had visions as well, although, not as much as dreams. It was almost 3 years ago when God showed me the vision of the transitional house. What building I would have, who would be helping to run it, what would be done there, etc. He told me every detail except WHEN it would happen. He was showing me what was in my future. That has been my hearts desire for several years. So there is no doubt in my mind that it will come to pass, in His time. Some people think I am crazy but I KNOW what God showed me that day. They will be shocked when they see the vision fulfilled.  Lord, I thank you that you do speak to us in so many different ways. I thank you that you love us enough to guide and direct us and to show us some things that are in our future. You are such an awesome God and I love you so much.  In Jesus Name

      Oh the praises I have for God this morning. This weekend was so awesome. I want to share a small part of it with all of you.  Sat. was Faithfest 2004. It was a BEAUTIFUL day and there were several salvations! This was the first time I got to use my power chair. My husband made me some ramps to get it in and out of my van. He had me practice the night before. I could actually load and unload it by myself! I can't tell you how much this chair helped me. I wasn't in any pain all day. I could move around and go from place to place. I was able to keep the speed under 100mph and I didn't run into anyone and knock them down! I did find out that you don't try to go downhill on high speed. When you stop, the chair tilts forward and it will throw you out! When that happened my son looked at me and said, "Mom, I am not going to pick you up off the ground if you fall out of that chair. I will act like I don't know you!" I guess that seatbelt is on there for a reason, huh? I was even told I could join the Forgiven Child of God Motorcycle Ministry now that I have wheels! Look out world. Here comes the Hula Biker Chic!! I may even wear my grass skirt and watch it fly in the wind! I thank God for His goodness and for the help I had on Sat. My neice, son and daughter-in-law set the booth up and took it down. Without them, I wouldn't of been there.  I missed going to the track Sat. night. From what I heard, it was an awful evening. God was using my oldest son to break up fights and settle people down. Now this was GOD! A few months ago, he would of been in the middle of them. God has really done a work in him and it amazes me to see the change. My middle son who races, told me NOT TO MISS any more Sat. nights! Everything had went smooth up to now. I believe he is seeing there is something to this "God thing", and that prayer does work! His car was messed up but it is fixable. Remember, this is that $10,000. race car! One of the other drivers is very upset with him because he bought this car from a guy who drove it last year and he couldn't beat it. Now Jeremy has it this year and he still can't beat it. So he was racing dirty. He hit my sons car in the side and ended up with his tire in my sons window. At the end of the race, the guy was going into the pits and his car caught on fire. That was a testimony to alot of them there as well. There were several that were upset at this guy and how he was acting. They saw that you don't need to take revenge in your own hands. They will be paid back for their actions and this guy was! This was only a small part of all that happened there Sat. night. The important thing is that there were several saw God work and acknowledged it! I just may take my chair and join them one night in the pits too! I would love to see this guy face to face if he isn't suspended from the track. One man was suspended for the rest of the year and isn't even allowed to go watch. It was a bad night to say the least.  Yesterday, my nephew came and put in central air for us. We have never had A/C. I don't like it but with my husband working outside in the summer, I knew he needed it. So I gave in. It was all given to us and put in for free. I thank God for that also.  God is so good and so faithful. I still sit in amazement at all He is doing. I have prayed and prayed for my husband and kids and I am seeing God work in their lives. I have stood on Acts 16:31 and I know that my household WILL BE SAVED!! To see my oldest son use what he loves most, racing, as his ministry, just blows my mind. Knowing how he was just a few months ago and seeing God change his heart and use him the way He is. I am just in awe. That leaves my husband and 2 more sons, but they are starting to acknowledge God now! They have no chance of staying where they are. God is about to snatch them from the path they are on and bring them to Himself!   Well, I better stop there. There is so much that God is doing that I can't possibly write it all. To think that only 2 months ago, I was giving up everything. I didn't think I could go on and didn't see an end to any of it. I want to encourage all of you to never give up. Never stop praying and believing God for your miracle and your family. It doesn't matter how bad things may look, God is working in it. Sit down, shut up and hold on. God is about to turn your world upside down and blow your mind! I know He has me and God does not show favortism. You are about to be blasted by the Holy Ghost and you will never be the same again!

      Tomorrow is a big day with Faithfest. I am looking forward to it. The weather is going to cooperate for once as well. Thank You Jesus!  I know tomorrow is going to be awesome. Whenever God is about to do something BIG, I am attacked physically. I have been feeling really good the last few days. Last night and this morning has been the opposite. I have been having more back and leg pain along with the other symptoms of the nerve damage. It is really hard to walk today. That is a sure sign of a great day tomorrow! The devil is soooo stupid!  The other day I had a lady tell me about a Bible study she went to and a comment that was made there. She said someone ask the leader why all people aren't healed. The leader answered the question telling her that God don't heal everyone so He can get the glory by showing others He will help them through their affliction. Then why do they go to Drs. to try to feel better or be healed if they believe it is God's will for them to stay sick or diseased? To me if they believe that, they are messing with God. I don't believe that way for a minute.  Jesus took the stripes and beating for ALL of us and for ALL the sickness and diseases. He doesn't pick and choose. He is no respector of persons. It isn't a stroke of luck that a person gets healed. It isn't Russian Roulette or a game of chance. If that was the case, not may people would be healed. They wouldn't have the faith. The Bible tells us that everyone was healed that had the faith and believed except in His hometown. He couldn't do much there because of their unbelief. Is. 53 and 1 Peter 2:24 tells us that ALL ARE HEALED, not a few that God feels should be.  I believe EVERYONE should be healed. I believe it all boils down to their faith and confession. The lady who was telling me this used the example, look at us. We aren't healed but God is with us in all of it. She is true is saying that but I believe there is a process. As we stand on Gods promise and His word, using our faith and our confession, believing that we are healed BEFORE we see the manifestation of it(Mark 11:23-24), we will be healed in God's time.   I believe that Jesus took the stripes for every human being to be healed. It is available to everyone. Some people don't receive. Some peoples confession stops it. Some peoples lack of faith in the power and word of God stops it. Some people just don't want to. I have a neice that has CP. She had ask for prayer several times for healing. I prayed and prayed for her then one day she told me that she didn't want to be healed. If she was, she wouldn't get her disability check and would have to go to work. Then there is another man who believes the Dr. before he will believe what God says. That just stops the healing that Jesus provided for us. So I believe the reason some aren't healed because of their unbelief, lack of faith, their actions, or their confession.  Healing is just as simple to receive as salvation. What Jesus provided on the cross is for everyone. It is up to us to receive it. It was finished on that day.  Just my belief. I am healed in Jesus Name. I have God's Word on it!

      Well, you all know the problems I have had in the past with my dog, Isaiah. I don't know what I am going to do with him. He is my baby.   A couple weeks ago, the mail woman came to the door with a letter I had to sign for. Isaiah threw a fit. The hair on the back of his neck stood up straight. As I was getting him back away from the door, (remember he weighs about 90lbs), he bit 3 of my fingers. He then went to the other side of me and bit my side. I had blood running down my hand and arm which got all over the card I had to sign for the mail lady.  A few days later, a friend of my sons stopped by. Isaiah didn't like him either. This time I learned NOT to try to get him away from the door. I foound me a BIG stick and drew it back at him. He backed off and didn't bark anymore.  I went to the Dr. last week for a mini check up and had her look at the bite on my fingers. They were healing ok I thought but one looked kind of bad. She look at it and said it was ok but I needed a tetnus shot anyway. GEESH. The trouble this dog causes me.  My husband says that he is just protecting me. I thank God that I haven't been in REAL danger. He would of eaten me alive! The grandkids come and jump on him, hit him, play rough with him and he just lets them do anything.   One thing I have learned in this. When the devil comes at you, grab your big stick, (the Word of God), shake it at him and he will back off. Works every time!

                   GOD WON'T ASK God won't ask what kind of car you drove, He will ask how many people you drove who didn't have transportation.  God won't ask the square footage of your home, He will ask how many people you welcomed into your home.  God won't ask about the clothes you had in your closet, He will ask how many you helped to clothe.  God won't ask about your social status, He will ask what kind of class you displayed.  God won't ask how many material possessions you had, He will ask if they dictated your life.  God won't ask what your highest salary was, He will ask if you compromised your character to obtain it.  God won't ask how much overtime you worked, He will ask if you worked it for yourself or for others.  God won't ask how many promotions you received, He will ask how you promoted others.  God won't ask what your job title was, He will ask if you performed it to the best of your ability.  God won't ask what you did to help yourself, He will ask what you did to help others.  God won't ask how many friends you had, He will ask how many people you were a friend to.  God won't ask what you did to protect your rights, He will ask what you did to protect the rights of others.  God won't ask what neighborhood you lived in, He will ask how you treated your neighbors.  God won't ask about the color of your skin, He will ask about the content of your character.  God won't ask how many times your deeds matched your words, He will ask how many times they didn't.  God won't ask how many people you shared this with, He will ask how many people you didn't because you were too ashamed.  Just something to think about.

       HAPPY 50th BIRTHDAY PASTOR BILL !!!!!!!!!    &nbsp; I thought I would write this tonight since PBR is on here so early in the morning. I have tried to write a post all day but couldn't seem to get one out until tonight.  I haven't been home too long from Pastor Bill's birthday party. It was great. Granny Lost showed up along with a few of her "old" friends. What a sight to behold! I wanted to say a few things about PBR. I had a chance to say them at the party but I knew better than to try. I knew I would blubber and snot all over the place.  Sept. 1 will be 13 years since I&nbsp;met PBR. I first found out about the church from the newspaper. The first time I walked in, I knew that was where God wanted me to be. Over the years, I have gotten to know Pastor Bill pretty well. We have had our good times and of course, our BAD times. I have quite the church, 1,2,3,4...... well, I lost count how many times I have quit, only for God to tell me to go back. That is where I am suppose to be.  One thing I really appreciate about PBR is he will tell you the truth. He will tell you how it is. If you get mad, oh well. You will eventually get glad again. He doesn't beat around the bush and that is what I love about him the most. Yes,&nbsp; he has gotten under my skin 1,2,3,4,....... times too.&nbsp; I always knew he was right, I just didn't like someone telling it to me.  PBR has been there for me when nobody else has been. He has put up with alot of crap from me&nbsp;and still loved me. He has talked me through alot of heartache and pain.&nbsp;Last winter, if it had not been for PBR talking to me EVERYDAY for about 2 months over IM on the Internet, I would probably be divorced right now and gone to&nbsp;another state.&nbsp;God arranged it that each day when I logged on the Internet, he was either on here or come on shortly after. He talked me through so much. More than he will ever know.&nbsp;  The few times that I have really messed up, (well, maybe more than just a few times), PBR would set me straight. He never put me down or never tossed me to the curb. He was always there to help me get back on the straight path and get my focus back on Jesus. He has always supported me in things I have done for the Lord and was always there to pick me up when I fell flat on my face.   PBR said something tonight that his mother always told him and&nbsp; I see it in him. He said we can be Christians and be human also. We can have fun. So many preachers and Pastors have that false face on, are fake, and aren't "real people". I am so glad that what his mother told him stuck. PBR sure isn't like that. He loves to have fun and it carry's over to the congregation..What other church do you know of that has a "Granny Lost"?  I could go on and on but I think this is sufficient. I want to thank God for giving me a friend and a Pastor like PBR. I pray we will be even closer as I get old and gray like he is. Maybe&nbsp;in his old age,&nbsp;he will give into liking twang ditty music too!  I am so proud to call&nbsp;PBR, "MY PASTOR AND MY FRIEND". Happy&nbsp; 50th Birthday PBR.&nbsp;I pray you will have many, many&nbsp;more! I Love You&nbsp;A Bunch!!

      There is a man I know in the Hancock Co. Jail. He has been there since Feb. I have been having Bible Study with him through the mail. He usually has questions for me every week. The last letter he had 2 questions and told me that the answers were NOT in the Bible. He has always said how much he has read the Bible and studied it. How many times he has read it through, etc. When I read the questions he had, I knew then, there is no way he could of studied and read as much as he said. I wrote him yesterday with the SCRIPTURES to answer his questions. Then I ask him if he had anymore questions that the answers were not in the Bible. The questions were so simple for anyone who has read even part of the gospels. #1 - How many Mary's were there? He told me there was only ONE, that the Bible does not talk about anymore. #2 - How did John the Baptist die? He said he knows he was let out of prison but he wasn't crucified and the Bible does not say how he died. DUH. He was beheaded. That is plain in 3 of the 4 gospels.  I had a phone call yesterday as well with a Biblical question. This person said that the Bible says "ashes to ashes and dust to dust".&nbsp; I told&nbsp;her that the Bible does not say that.&nbsp;She argued with me for awhile.&nbsp;She told me that&nbsp;she had heard preachers say that many times. I told&nbsp;her I don't care what&nbsp;she has "heard".&nbsp;She needs to get in the Bible&nbsp;herself and see what it really says, and stop listening to people. So I got all the scriptures on dust and ashes and called&nbsp;her back. She couldn't believe that preachers would say that and it wasn't in the Bible. I even used the KJV because she swears that is the "real" Bible and you can't go by any others. I explained to her that is why so many people are deceived. They take what other people say as the truth and don't study for themselves. She didn't know what to say after that.  In our Bible study, one of the guys wanted to have "homework". I told him that doesn't work with most people. Alot of people don't pick up their Bible except maybe on Sun. morning IF they take it to church and then midweek IF they go to Bible study. They rely on someone else to feed them the Word so they don't have to feed themselves. I remember we had a study about a year ago that we had lessons to read and questions to answer each week. Out of 10 people, only 2 would do them each week. They wouldn't even read it before Bible study and most of the time, didn't even fill out the answers to the questions during Bible study. That always upset me big time. Their excuse every week was "I didn't have time".  It is sad that people don't have time for the Lord and rely on others to tell them "what the Bible says".&nbsp; No wonder there are so many confused and deceived people in the world.&nbsp;

      I have written this thing 4 times and deleted it. Nothing sounds right today. It is one of those "down" days for me. Almost depressing. Guess that is what happens when you are busy for awhile and when it is all over, you kind of sit and wonder what&nbsp;next.  I have read some this morning. I haven't been able to do that too much lately. It is so quiet and peaceful. I have been up since 4:30am and ready for a nap now. See, PBR, you aren't the only one who can't sleep! I been thinking about all the things that has went on the past 3 weeks and all that God has done. Now I am "back to reality" and I hate it. I hate the feeling I have right now.   It is one of those days where you pray Jesus would just come right now so this would all be over. Yet you think about all those who aren't saved and will be left behind. I am tired of the struggles. It is days like this where I see why people fill their lives with so much busyness so they don't have time to sit and think about things in their life. That is what happened to me the last 3 weeks. I was so busy that I couldn't think about the "reality" of my life. Now, here it is, right in front of my face AGAIN.  I want to be like Mary, just sitting at the feet of Jesus.&nbsp;Then there is reality, Martha, always reminding me that I am still on the earth and there is things that has to be dealt with. Today is one of those days where I just want to go home. I am tired of struggling. I am tired of being so "up" and then be knocked down again. Today, I am just tired of living. Period.  The Bible assures us that His mercies are new every morning. That is the promise I hold onto today. I am looking for His new mercy tomorrow morning because I can't&nbsp;go on with&nbsp;this life without Him. I have tried that and it just doesn't work.  Sorry if this sounds negetive. It is just my heart and my feeling for today.

      Here it is Sunday morning already. Guess I lost track of the days with all that has went on the past week. I won't be in church this morning. My eyes are swollen, nose running, and coughing from some kind of allergies. It hit me Sat. evening. My leg is swollen, my body is aching, and I am moving really slow. So think I will take today and rest and go tonight when LaVerne and Edith are there. I can't miss the "twang ditty" music!  My van is still sick. My husband's truck won't stay running. My golf cart quit and my bike has a flat tire. My chair is in my van at my son's house. Does it sound like God is trying to tell me to stay home or is it the devil trying to get me to stay home? So right now I am without "wheels" again. I will have to thumb a ride to church tonight. Hopefully someone will feel sorry for me and pick me up!&nbsp;  The yard sale went real well. We had&nbsp;ALOT of customers the 2 days we had it. For some reason though, nobody wanted to buy the yard. So we still have it. Geesh! What is wrong with people? It was a great deal too! I did sell enough of other stuff so I can&nbsp; take my grandkids to Indiana Beach camping for 5 days. That was the whole purpose in it. Thank You Jesus! We are leaving next Sun. Aug. 1. PLEASE PRAY FOR ME!!!!!!!  All my grandkids and most of my family have been here the last week. My house is a total disaster area. It is like the sign says, "ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK"! We were eat out of house and home but I am thankful we had food for them. I am starting to feel spiritually drained. I haven't been able to get into the Bible like I usually do. I haven't been able to watch TBN like I normally do each day. I haven't been able to have my time with the Lord or just sit and listen for His voice. I can tell it has taken a toll on me and it has only been for 1 week.  I am really glad this week is over. I am so thankful for my family though. I know some families personnally that their kids and grandkids don't ever visit them or go see them. It is so sad to hear them say they haven't seen or talked to their kids in a month. They haven't seen their grandkids in a long time, etc. The worst part is they all live close by. It isn't like they live in another state or something. So I am thankful that I do see my family almost everyday.  Scripture for the day: 1 Thess. 5:16-18&nbsp; Be joyful always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus. (NIV)  Have a wonderful day in the Lord!

      It is so quiet here today. I have had 2 granddaughters with me all week. They went home last night. They have been a BIG help to me the last 3 days. I thank God for them. They helped me get things together for a yard sale. They also helped me get things together to go camping. Without them, there would of been no way I could of gotten these things done. Praise the Lord for grandkids. I should of had them first!! Just kidding. My kids are great too. They are just working most of the time.  A friend of the family passed away Tues. evening. He was about 60yrs. old. He wasn't sick or anything. Someone found him dead in the bathroom. It was a shock. Here one minute and gone the next minute. To my knowledge, he wasn't saved. I haven't talked to him in awhile so hopefully he gave his life to the Lord and I don't know it. We never know from one minute till the next what is going to happen.   I am without wheels again. My van got sick yesterday. The water pump went out of it. I got to Bible study and that is as far as I got. I had to get a ride back home. So looks like I am stuck home for awhile.   Sunday evening, LaVerne and Edith Tripp will be at my church at 6:30pm. I am excited. They play that&nbsp;TWANG DITTY music!!&nbsp;There are several people I have invited that are coming. Some even from Frankfort, Ind. I even think my husband is going!&nbsp;People will go to&nbsp;something like that who won't go to "church". I hope others have invited unsaved family and friends.&nbsp;He has a great testimony and is an awesome evangelist.  That is all for today.&nbsp;Please pray for the things I wrote about. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Finally, a day of rest!! I am sure ready for it. &nbsp; Yesterday, my kids and spouses and grandkids were here. Our youngest grand daughter turned one and we let them have a party for her here. When it was over, we got some news. Our middle son, Jeremy, got us all together and told us that they are pretty sure his wife, Mindy, is pregnant.They have been trying for 3 years now. I was excited because he loves kids and it finally happened. I am hoping it is a boy.&nbsp;We have 4 grand daughters but only 1 grandson. If it is a boy, they are naming him, Luke. Praise the Lord, a&nbsp;biblical name and they aren't even saved! They aren't sure how far along she is yet. But guessing, they think she will be due&nbsp;in January. &nbsp; That is all the news for this time.&nbsp;Going to rest now! Later&nbsp;

      That darn cow ate my grass skirt! I was really careful at the fair last night to stay away from matches and lawn mowers. Then I messed up and went into the cow barn to see the cows. That darn cow spotted my grass skirt and pulled it right off me and ate it. So today I will have to go back into that barn with my shovel and scoop up my skirt off the floor. Geesh. I wonder if I can possibly put it back together and have it dry cleaned?&nbsp; &nbsp; We had a great time at the fair last night. The Dale and Kevin show was great. They talked to several people just "off the street". They wouldn't let me call in and try to win anything though. They said I wasn't eligible this week. They even tried to take my cell phone away from me. I haven't won anything THIS WEEK, so I don't know what the problem was!! Geesh!! &nbsp; Today is the last day of the fair. I will have to admit that I will miss it. It has been a wonderful week of meeting and talking to people. We have alot of prayer requests in the box and people who want to be contacted for prayer. This is something&nbsp;new I tried this year and it was&nbsp;appreciated&nbsp;by several people. &nbsp; Tomorrow we go to&nbsp;Indy to feed the homeless. Then hopefully to the race track tomorrow night. That has been cancelled the last 3 weeks due to rain. So hopefully it will be nice tomorrow.&nbsp;Today is my youngest granddaughters birthday. She is 1 today. She is having a party on Sunday afternoon. So looks like my weekend is filled also.&nbsp;I am having a yard sale next week. I hope someone really needs a yard and I can sell it for lots of money!&nbsp; &nbsp; I love the Lord so much today. He has been so good to me.&nbsp;We don't always&nbsp;recognize all the blessings He gives us.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are too busy with our focus on what we need to do or how we are feeling. We need to get our hearts back on our first love and Him only. Then everything else will take care of itself. I can't get the crippled lady at the concert off my mind. How she gave herself totally to the Lord and focused totally on Him. Not caring if she couldn't worship like others do. Not caring who was watching or what others thought. She&nbsp;just loved the Lord with her whole heart, soul, mind and strength. Then through that, she was a witness to others. &nbsp; I want to share a couple praise reports I got&nbsp;yesterday. One of the names I took to the Benny Hinn Crusade last&nbsp;month was a man who had liver, colon and rectal cancer.&nbsp;I have known him and his wife for probably 25 years. He has fought cancer for 2&nbsp;years now. He went to his cancer Dr. on Wed. and was told he is now CANCER FREE! The Dr. was amazed. He told him he beat the odds of someone having&nbsp;that kind of cancer. Usually they die within a year. His family Dr. couldn't believe it either. Her mouth dropped and&nbsp;she said, "God must not be&nbsp;finished with you yet!"&nbsp; &nbsp; My daughter in laws grandmother fell and broke her hip last week. She called me at Bible Study last week and ask for prayer for her.&nbsp;She had surgery the next day and hasn't been doing very well. They had&nbsp;pretty much&nbsp;given up hope of her pulling out of it. Her kidneys were shutting down and she was in and out of conscienceness. Yesterday evening, they went to see her and she was up talking and was herself again. They were all amazed! I told them that God DOES answer prayer! I think this has spoken to my son and my daughter in law. They have&nbsp; fallen away from God the last year but God is faithful. I think He is using this to speak to them. &nbsp; So there is my life for another day. Hope all of you have a great day and weekend in the Lord. Remember to keep God first and&nbsp;everything else will work out. Step out of the boat,&nbsp;focus on Jesus and&nbsp;not the storm that may be raging around you. When you do that, NOTHING is Impossible with God! &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Last night was the Micheal W. Smith/Mercy Me concert. It was great but it wasn't the music or performance that spoke to me. It was a crippled lady sitting in front of me.  The handicapped section was right in front of where we were sitting. There was a lady that is crippled and in a wheelchair. As soon as the concert began, she stood up with the help of a cane and began to worship the Lord. She was holding up her crippled hands to the Lord and praising and worshipping Him. She didn't care who was around her or who was watching. She was in her own world, alone with her Lord. She was shouting out how much she loved Him. It didn't matter to her where she was at or who was there. She was giving God her all.  She would sit back down in her wheelchair for awhile and rest, then she would stand back up and begin worshipping Him again. I sat there and just admired her love and dedication to the Lord. She gave all she could to Him and didn't allow anything to stop her. No people, no infirmity, no pain, no disability, NOTHING.   There was a man and a woman that came with her. Mercy Me began singing a song about being homesick. We don't belong in this world. It isn't our home. That was when this lady, turned to the man and reached for him to get up. She put her arms around him and they began to slow dance. He man was holding her up and her head was laid on his chest. I sat there and cried. They "danced" for several minutes, not worrying about anyone around them or what others may think of them.  This went on the whole concert. The woman would worship for awhile and then turn to the man and "dance". I sat in tears through the whole concert. Wanting to have that much love and adoration for the Lord like she did. Not caring what was wrong with her. Not caring who was there. It was just her and her Lord. Nothing else mattered.  As I sat there watching her "dance", the Lord spoke to me and said, "I will hold you up just like this man is holding that lady up and dance with you. All you have to do is give me your all. Put your focus on Me and worship and love me. Not caring about anything else. It doesn't matter what you are going through. Nothing else matters except that you love and worship me. Love me right where you are at and I will hold you up and dance with you".  I thank God that He gave me the opportunity to go to this concert. I needed to see that lady. Someone who is crippled giving all she has to the Lord she loves so much. The joy on her face. The love shining through her smile. With tears flowing down her face as if to say, "Lord, you are everything to me. I don't need anything else but you". Not asking for anything. Not asking to be healed. Just loving and worshipping God. The most important part was this, she was not ashamed to do it.

      Just a short update on ministry.   I have the grass skirt hanging from the Isaiah 61 banner in my booth at the fair. People just kind of look at it and wonder what the heck that is for! It is so funny watching people's reactions! At least, their attention is on the banner that says, "Jesus Heals The Brokenhearted and Sets Captives Free"!!!!  All the water is gone out of my baptismal. So guess that idea is out. Although it is suppose to storm this afternoon and evening. Then be very nice the rest of the week. So maybe there is hope for the baptismal service yet! Who knows where God is taking this!  We have met some very nice people and been able to witness to several. It has been a great week so far. Alot of people are amazed that we are out there doing this. They come up to us and thank us. I sometimes want to say, "So why aren't you being a light in the dark place?" We are the only "church or ministry" at the fair this year. No, sorry, the Gideons are there handing out Bibles. They have came to our booth asking what we are doing and what Isaiah 61 does. It has just been awesome so far. Thurs. night, WJCF is suppose to have the Dale and Kevin show from my booth. Now this should be interesting to say the least. If you can get it, 88.1 FM, tune in from 6p-8p on Thurs. I just have one thing to say, they better be good to me!!!!  Guess that is all for the update. God is so awesome. Don't miss out on what God is doing.

      Three days down and 5 to go at the county fair. It has been really great. We didn't have the baptism service yet. Nobody seemed to want to lay down on the ground in the water. Oh well, maybe next year!  I am usually in the fair parade but this year I decided against it. It is so hot, not as hot as hell is though, and it is always miserable. I did get to watch it with my kids and grandkids this year. I haven't watched a parade in several years. It was so awesome to be able to do that especially since I have my chair now and can do things. I even got to "ride" around the fairgrounds. I haven't been able to do that in years either. I have always had to just sit at my booth. I feel so blessed to be "mobile" again! And get to be out with the people.  I have a box in my booth for prayer requests. I have papers that people can write them on and if they want to be contacted, they can give their phone number. That is optional. Last night, I went through them. There was one from a lady who is fighting depression and health issues. She wanted prayer for physical, emotional and spiritual healing. She put her phone number on there and ask to be called. I am looking forward to talking to her this week.   Alot of people have heard on the radio, WJCF, my name and about the grass skirt. I am taking the grass skirt to the fair with me today! I sure didn't know this would make that big of an impact on people. If God wants to use this for His glory and possible for the salvation of others, I am willing to wear it. What will God want me to do next? I really hate to know!! I had people come to me and said they missed the outhouses in the parade. They looked forward to getting that roll of toilet paper. Oh well, maybe next year!  That has been my life the last 3 days. I love serving the Lord. I will tell you this, be careful when you tell God, "Here I am, use me". He may have you doing some strange things! It is so much fun serving Him though. You don't know what He is going to do next! You just need to be ready.

      OK, who is the guilty party that turned on the water faucet? Yesterday evening was the first evening at the county fair. It stormed and rained and stormed and rained. I have a booth in a LARGE tent. We had the same space last year. Isn't it funny how they can set a tent up in the exact same place each year. For some odd reason, my space is the ONLY ONE that holds water. There is a dip in the blacktop and all the water runs to MY BOOTH. So I think we are going to put up a sign and baptize people. We are suppose to have more rain each day up to Tues. So I am sure we will have enough water for baptismal services, in my booth!  So much is going on this weekend and next week. Keep us in your prayers. I am starting to get use to all the road bumps. I have found out the more that comes against you, the better the time will be. God is going to do some awesome things. I can feel it.

      I just want to Praise The Lord today. He is so faithful and so good too us. Don't ever take Him for granted. Be Thankful in all things!  Yesterday we visited a lady in Rockville Correctional Facility. It was great and they even let us back out! I was amazed of God's goodness. I just knew that He would keep me in there for some reason. But I am back home. Safe and sound! Whew!!!! Be thankful for God's mercy and grace.  We had new people at Bible study last night. It was so awesome. They were really asking questions. It is so awesome to see all God is doing in our Bible study. We won't have it next week. It is the Michael W. Smith/MercyMe concert. So in 2 weeks, we will resume. Be thankful for your Christian brothers and sisters. Your church and your home groups.  The county fair begins tomorrow. I am so excited for some reason this year. I usually dread that LONG, HOT week. This year something is so different. I am excited to be able to be out among the public. I am thankful each morning that I can still get out of bed and move around. I have learned to not take your health for granted. It may not always be there.  I got word that my husband almost fell off a roof yesterday. Each morning I pray for all the workers in our business for God to keep them safe and protect them. Be thankful for your family and for jobs. It could all change in an instant.  I praise God for who He is. That we can go to Him with confidence, knowing that He hears us. I praise Him for His unconditional love. I praise Him that we can serve Him in all areas of our life. I praise Him for all the different personalities and people He has allowed me to meet. I praise Him for just being God and never forsaking us. We are never disappointed as long as our focus is on Him and Him only, and not on all the unfair challenges that life throws at us. He is above all, in all and through all. He is the great I AM!!

      I am worried about some people I have gotten to know. It seems they have either vanished off the face of the earth or have lost their minds. I don't think the rapture has taken place. I am still here and I was sure I would go. But maybe it was the hula biker chic in the grass skirt that changed God's mind.   Pastor Bill, hasn't written a blog in several days. The last one was of the 4th hole at the golf course he works at. Maybe he fell into the hole and nobody has found him yet. He probably hit the golf ball into the water and you know how he is if he loses one of those balls. He will dive in after it. The undercurrent may of gotten a hold of him and sucked him right on down. I hope someone cares enough about him to call out the divers to see if he is in there. At least find the golf ball so we can put it up at church as a memorial to him.  Poor Thom went fishing a month ago and he hasn't returned yet. People have been hanging out on his blogsite even though he hasn't been there. I could guess that he caught the "BIG ONE" and it ate him. Or maybe his cane pole just wasn't strong enough and he jumped in after the fish. Has anyone saw a big fish lately? If you do, open its mouth and see if Thom is in there. If the big one swallowed him, he probably took him to the North Pole and vomited him out. Thom needed to be cooled down.  Adam and Steve both quit writing. The Magpie will not be the same with them there all the time since they are not blogging. Adam likes to sit on walls and watch naked chics. Steve don't like anyone to know his real name. I wonder if he is involved in something we don't know about? Guess we need to watch America's Most Wanted more often.  Chris and Amy Reason have bailed out as well. Their kids may have gotten them in the basement and tied them up. In Amy's humility, she is probably waiting patiently for the Lord to release her. She is singing praises to Him in the midst of her trial. I'm not sure what Chris is doing in the midst of it. As long as the kids keep throwing bread and water down to them I guess they will be ok for awhile.  Cheryl's last post told us she was frustrated over a teenager. That was the last time we heard from her. She was so nice too. I hope they take care of her in the mental hospital. After all, she has been through, she needed a vacation. I plan on visiting her as soon as they take the white jacket off her.  Steve, Pastor Bills brother, has vanished too. I know he was in California for several weeks and I pray that he didn't get involved with the gangs out there. I don't know how "street smart" he is but I worry about him now. I know he is a very intelligent and giving man and I am afraid that he may have lost his way in Ca. Has anyone checked the Dream Center or under those cardboard boxes on the street for him?   I am worried about Marty Hensley. He doesn't post as much any more. I pray he is laughing himself to health and wellness. He wrote how he laughed and laughed when he saw my barn with WJCF 88.1 on it. He liked it so much he came back and saw it a second time. Maybe he will put the picture up on the wall at the radio station so he can see it all the time. Laughter does the body good like a medicine and a whole lot cheaper too! I do need to warn Marty about allowing Dale and Kevin have a radio show on Thurs. nights from 6pm - 8pm. I believe they have escaped from that same mental ward. I will grab the white jacket that I have and we will round them up together and take them back where they belong.   Jules is still with us. If she is here I KNOW the rapture hasn't taken place. Unless I caused her to fall away from the Lord the day she saw the grass skirt. Maybe just being with me those couple hours caused the Lord to change His mind about her too. GEESH....I always seem to be the one in the middle of things and get into trouble. I will keep watch on the posts she writes to see when she goes off the deep end. I may have to visit her in the hospital with Cheryl. That would be good. I will only have to make one trip then. It takes me awhile to get to Chicago via my power chair.  There are so many more I am really worried about. Some of them use to comment regularily but haven't heard from them in quite awhile. They may of had heat strokes. Has anyone checked the houses for bodies lately? I hope they are found. If only clothing is laying on the floor and no bodies, I know the rapture has taken place. Can you imagine all those naked Christians being taken up in the air to meet Jesus? What a sight that has to be.  Well, guess I better go and pray for all those who may be left behind with me. Maybe God will change His mind and come back for us. I hope he remembers all the places I will be in the coming days and can find me. I will be visiting at the prison on Wed. as well as Bible Study on Wed. nights. The county fair begins Fri. for 8 days. I won tickets to the Micheal W. Smith, Mercy Me concert on July 14. Jail Bible Study and the Country outreach is in the future, as well as the street ministry starting. Also I am taking 2 of my granddaughters to Indiana Beach for 5 days the first of Aug. Hopefully if God decides to come back and get me and I am not at home, He will find me. I sure would hate to be left a second time. That would look really bad on my reputation.   Have a Wonderful and Blessed Day in the Lord!

      I have been reading the book about the LA Dream Center called, "The Church That Never Sleeps" and how it got started. There is a sentence that caught my eye and I can't get off my mind. Matthew Barnett was talking about how he was put into the pastorate at a church in LA at 20yrs old. The church was going downhill and he didn't know what to do to make it grow. To make a long story short, he said he had to "get out of his world and into their world". He was talking about all the lost that were in that community. The gangs, the drugs, the drunks, the prostitutes, the killings that were right in the front door of the church but none of them ever came in.  A boy was shot and killed right in front of the church. Matthew took up an offering from the 25 people that were in church and took it to the boys family. It ended up that family got saved just because of that small gesture.  I have always said it is sad that the churches are all locked up except on Wed. night for Bible Study or prayer meeting and Sun. mornings. Alot of churches don't even have Sun. eve. services any longer. Or people call the church and they get an answering machine. We ask people to go to church with us but there is always excuses. WHY? People don't care what you know until they know that you care. They have to see that we have something that they want or need. When we get out of our world and spend time in their world, love them right where they are, they will come on their own.  I can't shake these thoughts. Lately they have overtaken my entire life. I am in the planning stages of beginning a Dream Center in Hancock Co. I am having some hard decisions to make along with all this. Am I ready to make the sacrifice to do this? Am I ready to give my whole life over to this work? Am I ready to lose family and friends to make this work? Am I ready to make that committment? Am I ready to pay the price? I don't know if I am ready. I must be or God would not have it so strong on my heart.  I have to do this. If I don't I will continue to be miserable. I just pray that those around me will eventually understand.

      As I have said, our Bible Study is studying dreams and how to interpret them. I have a question for all of you today. Has anyone ever had the dream that several people were watching you use the bathroom? If so, what do you think that means? I am looking forward to comments on this one!

      Yesterday I laid in bed pretty much all day. I thought about alot of things. I prayed. I cried. I prayed some more. I cried some more. The bad thing about it, God didn't say a word.  Today, I am tired of life. I want to just go home.   God, what the heck is going on? What am I doing wrong? Is there something that I am doing that is hindering answers to prayers? Do I need to do something differently? I need to know.

      Today seems like Monday. It has been a VERY LONG weekend! I have lost some days somewhere.  The funeral went ok yesterday. I was really concerned about what the preacher would say but I was impressed. As most do at a funeral, he talked on the 23rd Psalm. He didn't say anything about where Jim was now. He talked about how Jesus would be with us and hold our hand, etc. through lifes tests and trials. Then if we have a personnal relationship with Jesus, we would go to heaven when we die and spend eternity with Him. It was short and really good. He never said much about Jim at all. He only said that we all have our own memories of him and left it at that.  I am physically, spiritually and emotionally weak right now. I haven't been in church for 2 weeks nor Bible study. Last week, I didn't have a TV or computer, so I didn't have my "daily devotionals" like I always do. With the "neighbors" we had at Indiana Beach, all the kids and then the lupus flare, I wasn't in the Bible like I wanted to be nor did I have much quiet time with the Lord. It has taken a toll on me spiritually. It doesn't matter how long you have been a Christian or how strong you may be in the Lord, when you don't spend that time with Him and be fed, you will slip backwards.  My van is still broken. It has been 3 weeks now. Nobody seems to have time to fix it. So I am still stranded at home. I have to go to the hospital tomorrow to have the test done to see if I have a blood clot in my leg. Guess I will get my power chair or "race car" as Pastor Bill called it, and ride it into town! It was great having it last week. That is why I got to actually go to the beach and be in the sun that caused the lupus flare! Oh, what fun it is to be "free"!  I missed going to the jail again last night. I have missed the last 2 now. The Country/Western outreach is in 3 weeks and I haven't even started on it yet. We were suppose to start adopt-a-block in Sept. but can't seem to get people together to have the training meeting and go out with those who have been doing it for awhile now. Now I am wondering if it is God or if it is just satan trying to stop it. Some of the people that were wanting to do it has dropped out and it has left only 3 of us. Two of which can't walk and has to use "race cars". What good will that be? So guess I will just wait and see what happens.  I have been praying about getting a job to help out financially. I don't know what I can do but there has to be something out there. We sure didn't need all these hospital and Dr. bills. Thank God  my Dr. gives me samples of the few medications I take and we don't have to buy them too. Winter is just around the corner and I don't think we can go through another winter like last year. Work has been good this summer but we have been playing that catch up game and not been able to get anything ahead. So I'm not sure yet what I am suppose to do. The ministry will have to be put on hold if I get a job. There is no way that my body can take both. So I am still praying about what I am suppose to do at this point. I know God will supply my needs but I have to do my part first.  It is time to stop and rest for a day or two. I feel so drained right now and I need time with God desperately.

      First, I want to clarify something I said yesterday. I stated that I read the obituaries and see if they had any church affiliation. If so, that gave me hope that they were saved and in heaven. I stated that some may only say, "She was a homemaker". By no means did I mean that a person had to go to a church in order for them to be saved and go to heaven. This is just what I look for when I read the obits and don't know the people. If there isn't a church mentioned, I pray that they were saved and in heaven.  I saw alot of people yesterday that I haven't seen in a long time. One was the guy who we ran around with (and Jerry and I stole his dad's car one time), and he stood up with us when we got married. I haven't seen him in years. He recognized Jerry but didn't know me. I didn't know I had changed that much!  There were a couple people who came drunk. One was our nephew, Jim's oldest son. He wasn't taking the death of his dad too well. Another was Jerry's cousin. What was funny about him was he had just walked up to Jerry and I when Pastor Bill and Karla came in. He was using some language that wasn't very nice. As soon as Pastor Bill came over to us, Jerry got his cousin's arm and took him to another room!  The family found out yesterday that there is another member of the family. It happened 21 yrs. ago and she has 2 babies. Talk about a surprize! So that put the total of Jerrys family, just his brothers, sisters, their kids, their kids, etc. to 99. Yes, sort of a big family I would say. Then my daughter in law is pregnant and Jerry's neice is pregnant. So soon it will be 101. I didn't know a family this size was possible from just 2 people to begin with!! One person ask me the name of Jerry's nephews son. I told her I didn't know. I can't keep up with them. They have babies too fast for me! The good thing about it is, they all live close and it is a fairly close family.  I have always heard that there will be 3 deaths in a row. When we got home last night I had a message on my answering machine from my half brother. His daughter in laws father passed away yesterday morning. We have been praying for him for quite awhile. I let him use my wheelchair after I got my power chair. He was so tickled with it because he could actually sit comfortably somewhere. He sat in it all the time. I am so thankful that I could help in some small way to make his last days a little easier for him. That was the 3rd death of people I knew in a months time.  Today is going to be another long day. I have to call the Dr. and try to get in to see her either before or after the funeral. My face has cleared up some and my eyes are not as swollen. My foot and leg swelled yesterday to the point I wasn't able to walk on it by evening. With past experiences, it would be safe to say it is all part of the lupus flare. I keep reminding myself of what God told me. He said all this is temporary and that I was going to be healed. I have to keep my faith in Him and being His servant no matter what I have to do to accomplish that.  I thank God today for His unfailing, unconditional love to a person who was very unloveable. I thank God for His mercy that is new every morning. I thank God that He is my strength when I am weak. I thank God that I have hope and peace when the storms of life are raging. I thank God for always being with me. He means more to me than I could ever express in words.

      Each day, I read the obituaries in the newspaper. What I am looking for is to see if that person was affiliated with a church. I figure that if they were, hopefully they were saved and with Jesus. Some have long lists of all the organizations they belonged to, all their accomplishments, schools they attended, all the places they workd for so many years, etc. Then, in few words, there may be the name of a church they attended. Then there are those that only say,  "She was a homemaker".  My husbands brother passed away Thurs. To my knowledge, he wasn't saved. I pray that somewhere, he did give his life to the Lord before his mind left him. He has been in a nursing home for several years with alcohol related dimencia. He didn't know who he was, where he was, who anyone was, etc. I often wondered if he ever gave his life to Jesus before all this happened. By knowing him for 34 years, I would have to say, he didn't.  He was an alcoholic. In my "past or old" life, he was one of those we drank and partied with. We were real close,  like brother and sister, instead of in laws. I was saved only a short time before the dimencia took over. He was arrested for public intoxication and put in jail. A few days later, he didn't know where he was or who he was. The family ask me if I would go talk to the judge to see if we could get him released and take him to a nursing home. I did and the judge released him. He has been there ever since.  In his obituary it only stated where he worked, when he retired, and that he was a member of the Eagles Lodge in Greenfield. No church affiliation. No nothing else. My mother in laws pastor will be doing the funeral. A man that never knew him nor anything about him. I am sure he will have alot of good things to say as Jim was a good man. I am sure that he will say that Jim is in heaven and in a better place than we are, the status quo of a funeral, to "comfort the family". Even though he never knew Jim.  Today and tomorrow I will be with alot of our "drinking and partying" buddies. Alot of which are family. I am praying that God gives me the right words to say and to just be the Light in a dark place the next couple days. Jim is gone and only God knows where to, but there is still hope for those who are still here.  Please continue to pray.

      I'm home from a very interesting trip. We had a good time in the midst of trying times too.  I won't go into all of it but I do want to ask you to please pray.  I found out the hard way that a person who has lupus should not be in the heat and sun for long periods of time. It causes the lupus to flare up. It began on Tues and has gotten worse. My face is all swollen and my eyes are almost swollen shut. My left foot and leg swelled so much I couldn't walk on it. That part has gotten some better. Then, on Thurs. I got a call from my husband that his brother had passed away.  I am thinking about going to the ER today and find out what is wrong with my face, eyes and foot. Hopefully I can get it cleared up at least where my eyes will open. It is hard to even write this but I wanted to ask all of you to please be praying. We have alot of family coming in and will be at the funeral home tomorrow and the funeral Monday.   Will write more later. Thanks for your prayers!

      Well, I shouldn't be on here this morning. We are leaving in 2 hours for Indiana Beach. I couldn't leave without reading the morning blogs and writing one before I left. Geesh. Since it is before noon, is this considered an addiction? HUMMMMM......  I am going away for 5 days with 2 of my grand daughters and my best friend and prayer partner.We won't have any TV or COMPUTERS. PLEASE, PLEASE pray for me! I love the nights, sitting beside a campfire with worship music on and just listening to nature. (Of course, when nature calls, you better go!!) That is my idea of heaven. I have heard God speak so many times when it is quiet and just sitting there, watching the fire. Sometimes we go and just sit by the lake and meditate on God's creation and all that He is. We have Bible study each morning and also pray for everyone. We have prayer books we pray over as well.  We will be home on Friday. I will give an update on what God done this week. I know it is going to be AWESOME!  I Love all of you and pray you have a blessed week in Jesus!
