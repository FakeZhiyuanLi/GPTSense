      So now I have a Blogger account. Moo. I mean baa. I mean, something.   Don't even ask me why I obtained one in the first place. Oh, it's not that I don't know. I know all too well. I was stalling at work. Stalling at work, one of the greatest bastions of creativity ever. "I should be working" shall be the words with which I summon my Muse from here on out. Until I get fired, of course, and am forced to take up a career of freelance writing because no one else will hire me for any reason, ever. And then, of course, I will have to avoid doing that, and in order to find a creative spark I will go have to buck crates of soda onto someone else's truck. 1   In his excellent (and very influential to me) short-story collection  Blue Champagne , John Varley once wrote about type A writers and Type B writers. Type A writers approach their trade with gusto and focus. Type B writers create elaborate filing systems and answer the telephone and the doorbell. I am most definitely of Type B. I have, in fact, created an elaborate filing system for my writing; it happens to work, but it's elaborate. I don't have a doorbell, but I do answer the phone, often picking it up to call others if it means I can avoid sitting down to face the merciless blank page. I will go out to dinner, start new projects, clean the house, even go for a walk to avoid writing. But sooner or later, the page always faces me down, and I have to go back to it.   Also troublesome is the subject of tools.  Henry David Thoreau once wrote , "Men have become the tools of their tools." I am a great collector of tools. Some people can write on a legal pad, or on loose scraps of paper. Isaac Asimov, according to the foreword to the  Foundation Trilogy , wrote portions of it on the backs of bus tickets. In my time, I have bought notebooks of varying size, shape, and expense, from three-ring binders to fifteen-dollar leather-bound  Moleskines  (which are very nice, by the way). I have purchased a  portable keyboard  for my Palm to use as a miniature laptop (in conjunction with Wordsmith Pro). In my time I have owned so many old, outdated, decrepit laptops that it became the subject of much hilarity during my last move; there were at least four or five of them, running everything from Linux to Windows 3.1 to Caldera  OpenDOS . Right now, I am writing this on an  Apple iBook  purchased for me by my late grandmother for purposes of writing the Great American Novel before she died. I didn't get it written before she died. I was answering the telephone and the doorbell.   The iBook uses  DevonThink , a tool pretty much unsurpassed for creating and organizing lots of text files. It allows me to create elaborate filing systems like never before. Oh, thank God. Insufficient organization was really my problem, wasn't it? (No, no it wasn't). But the good news is, on the occasions when I really do generate some text, I know exactly where to find it again. Until the hard drive dies. Which reminds me, I have to go buy a flash drive for backup purposes.   No CD burner, you see. I am fairly happy with my little iBook, but as time goes on I begin to feel that I need a better laptop. A faster one, a bigger one, one with a CD burner and some other toys that I probably will have to generate an actual use for. However, it's difficult to justify the kind of expense this incurs, especially when I've grown fond of Apple laptops. They're about twice the damn price, you see. Because they're Apples, and stuff. Not that the extra price necessarily earns you much peace of mind. I could tell you stories about my original iBook, the one I had to get replaced eventually -- but that is a subject for another post entirely. But anyway, yes. They're expensive. And if I'm not using my little iBook as much as I should -- not to write the Great American Novel as was my intent -- then how can I justify a newer, more expensive model?   And so I made a pact with myself. If I wrote a 50,000 word first draft in the month of May, I could buy myself a new laptop in June. I started out with good intentions and a great deal of energy (most of it nervous). To my credit, I made some decent progress, but soon stalled due to personal concerns, jungle rot, yuppie influenza, and other excuses. 50,000 words descended from laudable goal to gibbering madness. Doorbells and telephones rang. Disorganized cadres of text files cried out for organization and leadership. And the shit altogether stalled.   So May became June, and June became whenever, and now June is over and the book is no closer to being done. It can all be chalked up to a routine lack of discipline, a carefully measured slackasserie. This is not a rebuke aimed at myself, mind you; just an observation of the facts. It is my habit to think about writing while steadfastly avoiding doing so. Whatever this particular element of my psychology is, wherever it came from, I imagine it is the same troublesome bugaboo that makes me buy video games that I never play, rent movies that I never watch, fill my bookshelves with books that I never read. Either I am the world's worst fraud or I just have a real knack, a talent, nay, a cultivated skill for avoiding those things that my time is best spent doing. Dare we even think it, which I enjoy.   So the theory is, make it work in reverse. If laziness is itself a discipline, a habit, a routine that is fallen into without thought or consideration, then let's turn that fucker on its ear. Make doing the things you love the habit. Do it for one week and you can do it for a month solid. Do it for a month solid and you can do it for a year. Do it for a year and you can do it for the rest of your lifetime. And soon, it will be the default, the habit not easily broken, the second nature that laziness is now.   And that's where this little project of ours begins.     1  A phrase stolen from Stephen King.

      One Thousand One is intented as a daily writing project in which the author posts a thousand words a day. The point of the exercise is practice and discipline, if not necessarily candor and coherence. With luck, the former will give rise to the latter. Until then, the words must flow. Think of it as a Daily Ironman Challenge of writing.

      Weeks pass. History became legend, legend became myth. Rumors grew in the East, whispers of a nameless fear... well... okay, we got hungry late one night. And, because we live in a not-so-big city, choices become somewhat limited after midnight or so. The diner-dive of choice became Denny's. God alone knows why.   We get there a little after midnight, on a weeknight. The parking lot has a few cars, but nothing alarming. Flush with hope and youthful naivete, we go inside.   We're seated about four booths from the front door, with me getting a good view of the entrance and the girlfriend facing the back corner tables. It's fairly quiet, except for some girl who is slumped so low into her seat that her jaw touches her stomach; she's either incredibly drunk or has had her spine removed. Unfortunately, she later moves, ruling out the whole spine-removal thing.   We order our food, which turns out to be the death of hope far sooner than we anticipated. Craving greens after days of eating, well, crap, I order a salad with some Thousand Island. The waitress brings a salad with a few limp lettuce leaves, a pile of cheddar cheese, a tippy glacier of croutons, and a child's teacup full of dressing on the side. I presume, given the volume of dressing I'm given, that this is so I can choose which quarter of the salad I want to moisten. Dispirited, I disassemble Mount Crouton; my girlfriend, eschewing her tomatoes, throws them on my plate. Apparently it is some unwritten rule of eating with women that my plate become the garbage scow for the tomatoes they don't want -- because it always happens. Someday I will meet a girl who actually eats her tomatoes and won't know what to do. Probably tip the table over screaming " this is bullshit!"  and storm out.   Anyway. The peace and quiet is not to last. Before long, two young kids (by which I mean in their late teens -- God I'm so fucking old) decide that the front counter of Denny's is the cool place to be after midnight, and stand there with their to-go shakes, talking with the hostess and giggling madly. Tee-hee! Badasses of Denny's!  That, however, is just the teaser. I can't remember who came first -- Hick and Halter Top, or Snooty Whore and The Marine -- but it barely matters. The point is, they came in -- and the peaceful part of the evening was over.   Hick and Halter Top are pretty much self-explanatory. The guy was in his twenties, unshaven, dressed like a yoboy, complete with off-kilter baseball cap. The girl had a bare midriff and a vapid expression. That pretty much sums them both up. They came to sit behind me.   Snooty Whore was a fifty-year-old woman with a Martha Stewart hairdo and a black dress that did little to hide her burgeoning paunch. She carried herself with a regal, richer-than-thou air, which would have been more convincing were she not reeling around drunk at Denny's at one in the morning. Her companion -- date or dad, I couldn't really tell -- was a piebald, psoriasis-addled old fuck with sunburned wrists and a short-sleeved shirt. We'll get to why I call him The Marine in a minute.   The hostess greets them. "Hi, two tonight?" she asks. The Marine is reliving the Tet Offensive, he can't be bothered to reply. He's loaded. Snooty Whore doesn't reply either, but rolls her eyes and frowns in what she probably believes is a haughtily dismissive gesture, and waves vaguely towards the booth where she wants to be seated. The waitress doesn't see this, as she's still on the "how many" question. "Right this way," she chirps, and starts to lead them back, away from us, yes please God, away -- when Snooty Whore makes the same gesture towards the booth right in front of us, and crows, "We want to sit here -- is that  okay ?"   The waitress says that is fine and seats them. Snooty Whore gives another offended roll of the eyes and a disapproving scowl; she cannot believe these plebian buffoons who are treating her as if she's just some aging martinet sauced to the gills at a Montana diner in the middle of the fucking night.   The Marine pipes up. "So what's the ETA on our food?" he demands.   "What?" the waitress asks, confused.   "The ETA!" The Marine bellows.  "The what?"  "The estimated time of arrival!" The Marine slurs. Yes, you read it right. The Marine had just demanded to know when the food that he had not yet ordered would be arriving. Apparently they're in a big fucking hurry. Some rich oil winos to meet with later.   "Um, usually about twenty minutes," the waitress informs them. "Do you know what you want?"   "No." Snooty Whore looks down her nose at the menu. The waitress wisely disappears for the next fifteen minutes. This is remarked upon loudly every thirty seconds by The Marine, incidentally, for whom ten minutes is equal to an hour.   Meanwhile, behind me, Hick and Halter Top are deep in a getting-to-know-you conversation. While, sadly, I cannot recount all of what was said, I can give you the basic gist of it:   Hick: "Yeah, n'shit, I always thought, like, you know, when I was twenty-seven, I'd be like a professional bull rider and shit, and I'd have the fuckin' wife and fuckin' kids, and, you know, the fuckin' house and shit, and fuckin', it didn't happen, and, like, a bunch of shit happened, and I'm not really sure about a lot of it, but I went through a lot of fuckin' shit, you know, and it like, fuckin', made me wiser and shit, you know what I mean?"   Halter Top: "Shyah!"   Then Halter Top started talking about some guy who had multiple girlfriends, to which Hick replied "So they 'kick it' every day? He must be really 'down' in the sack." Now, racial sensitivity aside, you don't need me to tell you that a twenty-seven year old wannabe professional bull rider with a Montana accent talking about anyone being "down in the sack" at Denny's is enough to give anyone the giggle fits -- and that's pretty much what we both got. They continue in this vein, while Snooty Whore and Marine complain loudly about how long they're waiting for their food, in between bouts of letting their chins loll onto their chests in a drunken stupor. Managing to catch the waitress on a refill-run (we knew we'd never see her again after she gave us the bill), we ordered our milkshakes to go and got the fuck out of there. And vowed never to go to Denny's again.   And this time, I really mean it. I know I've broken my vow many times before. But I'm fuckin' wiser and shit now, you know what I mean?

      Every time I end up in a Denny's, I vow never to go there again. Somehow I always keep forgetting this vow. It's obvious I would never make a good brooding, lonesome antihero seeking vengeance. I'd just forget after a few months, what I was seeking vengeance for, and what I'd ever planned to do about it. My name is Inigo Montoya -- I'll have the Moons Over My Hammy.   Now, my reasons for vowing never to set foot into another Denny's as long as I live -- well, they barely need mentioning. The greasy, horrific food; the terrible service; the cloyingly generic decor -- Denny's is a good place for loaded nineteen-year-old girls to go at four in the morning and write FUCK THIS in black crayon all over the comment cards, but if you don't fall into this admittedly narrow demographic, you basically have no business there. Yet, somehow, mysteriously, and often without warning, I find myself there. Why? Frankenstein anti-sex rays from space? I don"t know. I just know that it  keeps happening .   Everything I am about to tell you is true, though much of it has now attained the status of legend.   The first vow came many years ago, when I was still in college and the Denny's was rather freshly minted in our little dive. Aaron and I go to breakfast. Unwisely, we choose Denny's. The morning started inauspiciously enough -- I ordered something vile and artery-clooging; Aaron ordered something with eggs on the side.   It didn't take long before we noticed the Terrible Old Man across the aisle from us. I never actually got a good eyeful of the Terrible Old Man. Aaron saw him as plain as day: an old man in flannel and a fluffy white crown of hair, sitting across from a pair of pretty young teenaged girls, both paralyzed in fear. Both paralyzed in fear because the Terrible Old Man was making intermittent wet, hawking, blowing, choking, gurgling, regurgitating noises and spitting up some manner of greenish goo.   The sounds that came from this man's throat, I cannot really describe, although I have done my best to imitate them on my many attempts to gross the hell out of people at the dinner table. The best way to imagine it would be to envision Wilford Brimley drowning slowly beneath a non-stop trickle of pea soup. And it continued throughout our meal. I dared to look back a couple of times, and was profoundly sorry I did so.   The good news is, it drew our attention away from the usual crappy service and bad food. The waitress, in addition to being pokey, forgot Aaron's eggs. She realized this only after the fact.   "Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't bring your eggs," she said, laying down his plate.  "Forget the eggs," Aaron said with the level, no-bullshit gaze he reserves specifically for service industry folk who have wronged him and friends who have taken a joke too far.   "But I can bring --"  "NO EGGS."  We finished our meal and left. As we were driving away, me behind the wheel and Aaron sitting limply in the passenger seat, he slowly began to unravel before my very eyes. "Those poor girls," he began, shaking his head in disbelief, recounting in choking sobs the horrible sounds and green drippings and horrified pretty girls, and by the end he was leaning forward, banging his fists on the dashboard, literally screaming, " Never again, never again, never again! "  Thus came the first ever no-Denny's vow. Not a solemn pact between brothers, but a screaming oath shouted into the uncaring void of some mid-90s summer day. I love that story.   The second vow (that I can remember) came when Greg and I stopped in late one night for some sandwiches and perhaps some dessert. So, on a night when it was not particularly busy, and the wait staff far from overworked, we stopped in at the infamous Denny's.   This story is not nearly so epic nor interesting. The waitress merely took our order, delivered our food, and    was never seen again by any living man.  (Cue organ music.) Okay, she was seen again, but only after we were back at the front of the restaurant, trying in vain to get our check from the host.   "Aw, I was just coming to see if you guys wanted dessert!" our elusive server said cheerily, fishing the bill out of her apron. Evidently she smelled the decaying corpse of her tip and was angling for a last-minute reprieve.   "We did," Greg said drily, "Forty minutes ago."   Upon exiting the restaurant, we asked each other why we'd gone to Denny's. Neither of us could come up with a good reason. And so we decided we'd never go there again.   The third vow was only a few weeks ago, when the girlfriend and I went to get breakfast. Again, this is something short of a saga. We ordered breakfast: bacon, eggs, biscuits, orange juice, coffee. You'd think that would be simple enough. You'd be so wrong.   Now, a bit of a side note about the coffee. Denny's coffee is, without doubt, the worst God damned swill on the planet. We have a local chain, 4B's, which is pretty tolerable, even palatable on a good day. Perkins is fairly acceptable, as diner-dive fare goes. Nothing to compare with real coffee-shop coffee, but passable stuff. Denny's brings to mind the old Dagwood-era chestnut about a dirty sock tied inside a giant urn. Sure, it's black, it's in liquid form, you could even drink it. But it's not coffee. I need so much sugar and creamer to get through that mess that I have to ask for seconds of each before the meal is through. And given the track record on service, you can probably guess how well that goes.   Anyway, so we're sitting there for 40 minutes, and I'm trying to drink the thoroughly terrible coffee, while we wait for the biscuits we ordered with our meal. "Those biscuits will be  right  up," the waitress says, putting on her Contrite Face -- the one you wear when someone, not necessarily you, has royally fucked up somewhere on the assembly line, and you have to be the one to face the irate customer.   Now, the biscuits were not that big a deal. At least they didn't seem to be, at first. I mean, we've got our crappy, plastic-looking mass of eggs, these limp and greasy strips of what might conceivably be bacon, several triangles of tasteless white toast that manage to be both stale  and  soggy due to a margarine-application process known only to Denny's waitresses and certain upper-level Masons -- with such an embarrassment of riches, what do we need with biscuits for Christ's sake?  But then the waitress came by a second time, to let us know those biscuits would be  right  up, guys, I'm  so  sorry, and it started to  seem  like a big deal. Well, shit, these biscuits must be some manner of big deal, to be so thoroughly apologized for. So we waited -- something like forty minutes, in total -- for these biscuits. And when they finally arrived, they were horrifying, underdone pieces of shit. Not just, you know, mildly underdone -- these were like someone's idea of a bad grade-school joke; slightly crispy biscuit exteriors filled with Elmer's glue. The kind of thing you bite into and instantly regret, for the rest of your miserable life.   "Well, they're kind of like biscuits, on the outside," the girlfriend remarked, picking at hers listlessly.   And so comes another vow. And thus begins the latest tale.

      In December of last year, I bought my first Moleskine notebook. For the uninitiated (not to imply this is stuff you would need to know), Moleskines are expensive, leather-bound notebooks, complete with little pockets and bookmarks, a binding tie that goes around the end, and an historical pedigree that (according to the inset card) goes back to Leonardo da Vinci and James Joyce -- though not necessarily in that order. These are no simple, disposable notebooks, intended for jotting down random ideas sloppily and without reverence; these are notebooks with a cachet, by God, a history -- they're like the iPods of the pen and paper world! And thus almost completely useless until you get the hell over it and just start messing them up.   Moleskines come in several varieties; large and lined, large and blank, small and lined, small and blank, small and graph-papered, large and accordioned to open into one long strip of paper. I now own four of the damn things. The first, small and blank, was for general ideas and doodles -- there is a bit of a comic strip in there about a modern-day vampire, some roleplaying notes, a snatch or two of rhyme / song / dirty limerick, some bits of script for a comic / short film, and some other minutiae that even I likely won't remember much about later on. I picked the small, unlined notebook for jotting because, I told myself, ideas must be allowed to flow freely without the restriction of artificial boundaries. They must be allowed to sprawl across the page, without remorse or regret, even if the space in which they seek to sprawl is only inches across. Someday I will be like Pollock and write FUCK in letters eight feet high on a sheet of notebook paper custom-pulped to fill a room, but today is not that day.  The other notebook, the lined notebook, was more Serious Business. The boundaries here would be respected, because the lined notebook was for serious work.   Of course, I started breaking my own rules right away.   The first page was a tiny paragraph, cramped into the center, about two men who had no ideas about what to write. I wish this sort of thing were a bit more uncommon with me than it actually is. The next few pages were notes for an impromptu game I ran while visiting friends in Minneapolis. Then came an ostentatious "Part Two," entitled The Diary of Alonzo Fuckstain. The pages of this autobiographical screed spread across the pages lengthwise, disrespecting their own boundaries. Devoid of paragraph breaks, the diary just yammered on and on like a caffeinated schizophrenic. To its credit, it went on for pages before finally running out of steam, right around the new year. Run-on sentences gave way to space-devouring doodles, a transparent attempt to ramp up the page count.   That, in turn, yielded to a series of self-confrontational dialogues, which should be taken by both the casual reader and the author himself as a good reason never to write in a crowded public place. I simply don't have the stomach for it. I get self-conscious, and self-consciousness turns to self-loathing over the inability to lose oneself in one's work while being around people. The only really good writing is done with the door closed, as a lonely business, devoid of the sheltering of kind words or gentle critiques. There are pages full of this torturous material, all borne of self-consciousness, aspiring to catharsis or transformation but amounting to little more than flatulence.   It ends abruptly, and begins again with Part Three: Tea with the Dragon. An incomplete nine-page epic, it is an attempt at a sort of Don Quixote-type satire, complete with a racist, scoundrel drunkard of a knight and his pragmatic and under-appreciated squire, embarking on adventures that are more squalorous than grand, filled with self-important village mayors, highly literate but bored dragons, and a princess wholly unworthy of rescuing. It lumbered along for a handful of paragraphs and then died on the vine. More doodles. And a big page that says FILLER in all capital letters.   And suddenly, in the book, it's April. The Moleskine has gone from a paragraph of self-referential junk, to game notes, to journal entries, to the abortive beginnings of a short story, and several spaces in between. The next section, in keeping with this trend, bore little relation to any of the previous, being a continuation of a novel-in-progress that was transferred to the Moleskine when the laptop ran out of battery charge one night at the laundromat. Then May rolls around without a word written, and there appear several pages of notes about my trip to Washington, D.C. Another page of doodles, and a page of signatures.   Then comes Part Four: Hard Truths; back to diary entries again, except this time they are short and brutal instead of long and self-indulgent; one side of my brain telling the other what's what in no uncertain terms. It's the shortest section of the notebook, and probably the most important. And then there's a Windows serial number. And then we're on to Part Five, which is notes for that selfsame novel, still in progress.  And now it's July, and the Moleskine has been through some hard times. The pages are ink-smeared and rough. The lower edges are all water-damaged, and the cover has some visible scuffs, though it's not, perhaps, as battle-weary as it ought to be if it got regular and rigorous use. The interior is a mess -- a polyglot of different subjects, approaches, voices, inks and even handwriting styles.   I used to despair that my little Moleskine was so inconsistent -- that I couldn't seem to stick to a particular goal, or even category, for what the notebook was about. I envisioned in my mind neat rows of orderly text, a treatise of well-organized thought, preserved over time. Instead, it's like an autopsy; an organic mess of innards, spread out all over, getting a mess everywhere, disrespecting their boundaries. It leaps from topic to topic, sometimes without apparent reason or transition, abandons plans, and is in general full of unexpected twists and turns, never quite consistent.   And in that, it's turned out to be far more personal, and indicative, than any neatly penned diary ever could have been.

      I spent the night transcribing Samoan, Polynesian and Maori creation myth notes for a story I'm working on. Since it is, technically, writing, I'm placing it here as fulfillment of tonight's contract. Never mind if it isn't much interest to you and / or not at all funny. A thousand words is a thousand words, dammit.   ---  Samoan Creation Mythology  Pulls from elements of Hawaiian Creation, Maori Creation, Polynesian Creation, Society Islands Creation,  Tahitian Creation  Tangaloa-Langi, the creator, lived in a cosmic egg. When the egg broke, the pieces of the shell fell into the waters and became the Samoan Islands.   In the best-known Samoan creation, the ex nihilo creator is Tangaroa, the ocean god for many Polynesians, but the supreme being for the Samoans.  Tangaroa lived in space alone before there was any form to the universe. He stood still once, and a rock grew. He told the rock to split, and it did (see also Creation by Word). Many other rocks came along, too, representing various phrases and ideas still used by the Samoans.   Tangaroa hit the original rock and it gave birth to the earth and sea. Then the various rocks spoke to each other. Tangaroa spoke to the main rock many times, bringing forth fresh water, the sky, space, height, and other htings and ideas. He also called up maleness and femaleness, Man, Spirit, Heart, Will, and Thought. Then he left his creation floating about aimlessly after instructing the rock.   Tangaroa told the rock that spirit, thought, will, and heart were to come together in man, and they did that. Man was to join with Earth to make a couple -- Fatu (male) and 'Ele-ele (female). They were to populate a certain part of the world.  A certain rock-phrase, "Chief to Prop up the Sky," was told to hold up the sky over the earth, but he was not very successful until he made posts.   Now Tangaroa-the-Creator made Tangaroa-the-Immovable (chief of the sky) and Tangaroa-the-Messenger (his ambassador to the other heavens).   Night and Day lived in a lower heaven and produced Manu'a, Samoa, Sun and Moon as offspring. The Messenger called Night, Day, and their children to a council with the Creator and the Immovable. There they were told that Manu'a and Samoa should go down and become chief over the descendantds of Fatu and 'Ele-ele. Sun and Moon were to go down, too, to follow Night and Day.   Polynesian Creation  The most common of the Polynesian creation myths -- of which there are several, with many variations of plots and names -- describes the god Tane as artist-creator (see also Creation by Deus Faber). It was Tane, for instance, who first made woman -- out of red clay. She became the mother of humanity by Tane, who then committed incest with their daughter (see also Incest in Creation Myths). The first male was named Tiki or Ki'i (see also some other shit I don't want to transcribe).   There are more complex myths. Many Polynesians say that in the beginning there was Rangi and Papa (Heaven and Earth) coupled in darkness. Their offspring wondered about creation but could not see it because there was no light. They held council, and the angriest of the children, Tumataunenga, suggested killing the World Parents. His brother, Tane-mahutu, suggested the simpler process of separating the parents. Only the god of winds and storms voted against this plan.   Rongo-ma-tane, the god of cultivation, tried to stand up to separate the parents, but he failed. tangaroa, ocean god of fish and snakes, tried next but also failed. The same thing happened when the other gods tried, until Tanemahutu, god of forests and flying things, stood on his head and, with his feet, pushed his father up from his mother as they cried out in agony.   Now there was light and the people were revealed. The wind god was angry, however, and he sent forth a terrifying series of storms and hurricanes to punish his brothers. The various offpsring of Rangi and Papa, led by the forest god, Tane, and the ocean god, Tangaroa, argued over what to do. Some chose to go to land, some chose going out to sea. Tane gave his children canoes and nets so they might catch the children of Tangaroa, and sometimes Tangaroa swallowed up Tane's people. It is still this way today between the children of Tane and Tangaroa.   Eventually the fierce brother, Tu-matauenga, who had originally advocated Rangi and Papa, overcame the wind god and ate all of the original gods. Tu-matauenga is, in reality, the form called man, and after he ate his brothers, he turned them into food for his offspring. This is what the original gods are today.  Some Polynesians -- especially in Hawaii and NZ -- say that the last son of Rangi and Papa (Heaven and Earth) was Maui, who, like the Greek god Prometheus brought fire to humankind and tried to give them immortality.   Still another South Pacific myth says that the people live in a huge coconut shell. In the depths of the shell's interior lives the demon-woman, Vari-ma-te-tekere or Very Beginning (see also Mother-Creatrix). She made the first human being, Vatea, from a piece of her body. The father of humans and gods alike, Vatea was half man and half fish. His name means noon, and his eyes are said to be the sun and the moon,. Vatea was given the perfect middle land between brightness and gloom. Later he would marry the well-known Polynesian goddess, Papa (Foundation).   Out of another bit of herself, the Great Mother made Tinirau (Innumerable), who was also half man and half fish and was given the Sacred Isle (Motu-Tapu) as his home.   Out of her body the mother made many other beings and places for them to live. She even made Raka (Trouble), who controls the winds. Her last child was the beloved daughter, Tu-metua or Tu, to whom the moon is sacred. Her nephew was the famous Polynesian god Tangara (Taaroa).   Maori Creation   In the beginning there was darkness and water, where Io lived alone and inactive. In order to become active, Io uttered words calling on darkness to become "light-possessing darkness". So came light. When Io called for the light to become "dark-possessing light," darkness returned. Day and night had been born. Io continued creating with words -- the "ancient and original sayings, which caused growth from the void." (See also Creation by Word)  Io called on the waters to separate and the heavens to be formed. Then Io became the gods. Most important, he created Rangi and Papa -- Sky Father and the Earth Mother -- who cleaved together in a procreative embrace,  crowding their offspring. Two of these, Rongo and Tane, created plants, forests, and insects. Tane separated his parents to make more room; he was the god of life. Rangi and Papa were so sad to be separated that to this day Randi drops tears on Papa and Papa's sighs rise as mist to her spouse.   Other children of the first parents were the winds, rains, earthquakes, and Tu, the warrior god whose children are the fearless Maori. The tenth child of Rangi and Papa was Tangaroa, the father of the hero Maui. Some say that the sun is the eye of Maui and that the eyes of his children became the evening and morning stars. Other say that Maui was thrown into the sea by his moonmother, Taranga, and rescued by Io, who hung him on the roof of his house.   The Maoris call new Zealand the Fish of Maui. Maui gave fire to humans, and he died in a search for immortality. He needed to make that search because the last child of Rangi and Papa brought death to the world.   The first Maori was made by the god Tane out of red clay. Some say that it was the god Tiki who made the first man in his own image, and thus he named him Tiki after himself.   ---  And there you have it. No Internet access this weekend, so posts will have to keep until after Monday. See you then.

      I have a basement apartment. It's not bad, as such things go. It's a finished basement. There is linoleum on the floors and some nice Seventies wood paneling on the walls. There is not much sunlight -- in fact, next to none -- but for one in my profession, this is not only expected, but  de rigeur  to a certain point. I have also liberally spread Doritos bags and six-packs of Mountain Dew around the place just to really bring home the whole nerd-hole decor. Actually, that's another lie (continuing, for a moment, our little motif from yesterday).   There is one objection, however, and that is the bathroom. The bathroom and I don't get along that well, for reasons I will now go into in stultifying detail. Call this particular entry the "try to lend something completely banal some semblance of entertainment value" entry.  First off is the location. The basement apartment is set up as follows. There's the bedroom, in the corner of the basement. Attached to that is the living room. There's one door out of the living room, which goes straight to the upstairs stairwell. So on your right are the stairs up, to the shared kitchen and that mystical Shangri-La that some call "Outdoors," where the sun and fresh air  supposedly  reside. Directly across from the living room door is the door to the other part of the basement, wherein resides unused exercise equipment, a broken dryer, at least one bicycle, a mountainous glacier of "retired" computer towers, discarded baby toys, the Shroud of Turin, some old furniture, and a back room with a single chair facing a door and a single low-watt bulb that is always on. (This is the "Stanley Kubrick's The Shining" portion of the house, and I know without doubt that if I go into the same room with that chair, lightbulb and door, that I will die. But that's another story.) Anyway, there's also the bathroom.   Hopefully you're getting the gist of this. In order to get to the bathroom, you see, I have to cross the stairwell. The stairwell that goes upstairs and / or outside. Which is not so bad, most of the time, except if I'm freshly showered or want to trudge dishabilly to the can at four in the morning. Which happens a lot, with my drinking habits, let me tell you. So if I want to make it to the bathroom, and don't have a robe or some underwear or something, I have to do not one, but  two  "checks" to see if anybody's coming downstairs to use the washer or obtain a bicycle or something, then again to see if anyone's rooting around in the basement with a roque mallet or whatever. I haven't been caught yet, but my time is coming, and then there will be shrieking and throwing of objects and shooting and running back to the car and yelling "bear!" Yeah, and no one wants that.  So the location sucks. But once you get there, free from shriveled humiliation, your fun is only just beginning. First off, the door not only doesn't lock, but it doesn't close completely. That means that determining the "occupied" status of the bathroom is pretty much a crap shoot (Hah! I'm on fire to- night! ). Given that generally people don't come down here, that's really not much of an issue.  But it could be . I'm a big bathroom-door-locker from way back. I'm not a real firm believer in having the girlfriend shit while you shave. I mean, I'm not  against  it, but sometimes a man wants to be alone with his "personal, private, private business," as Hank Hill says.   Next up is the shower. Now there's an objectionable device. First of all, there's no bath. I like me a good bath. But this is one of those stand-up pre-fabricated shower stalls, and there's no bath to be had. (There is an upstairs bath, which is ironically actually worse than no bath at all -- but that's another story.) The top of the stall is open to the ceiling, so there are rafters and beams and dust bunnies and probably spiders, right about head-level for me. Because I am two meters huge, the shower points directly at my breadbasket, whichi is kind of my lot in life, so I don't take that as a particular affront. I think that some people can actually aim the water at chin-level when they take a shower -- I have read it in stories and seen it in the movies, but I'm not entirely sure it's true.   Also, the shower itself is of "Watts Riot" level water pressure, unless the sprinklers are on outside, in which case it's more of the "Seattle Drizzle" school. The shower curtain, at intervals, mysteriously ceases to retain properties of solid matter, allowing water to pass through and soak the foot rug. The space is too narrow for my manly girth and so shampoo bottles and back brushes are routinely knocked to the floor. Strange and mysterious growths appear on the walls, and won't entirely go away even with a rigorous application of Lime-A-Way. And when you shut the shower off, it doesn't really shut off. It continues to drip and drizzle, no matter how you crank on it. So fuck the goddamn shower.   On to the bathroom sink, which is no prize either. First of all, the medicine chest is too narrow, and its shelves are of a Lovecraftian, non-Euclidian make. There are little ridges and corners and sub-shelves in there that make me scratch my head and think, "who's the Tourette's-addled psychopath who put this together?" The shelves are perhaps wide enough to accommodate a tube of toothpaste, if you work at it. If you have a roommate or a girl over and she has a second toothbrush, or God help you, her own toothpaste, then you are well and duly fucked. The space between the medicine chest and the sink is too shallow to put anything there. Sure, you can put your stubby water glass up there, wise guy. You probably even have your toothpaste down there, because you're sick of it falling out and stubbing your toe again. But just try putting that bottle of foaming antibacterial hand wash you bought in there, so you can, you know, wash your hands.   Nice try, asshole. Open the mirror and that fucker's going right into the sink, probably to break off the little plastic nozzle on top that dispenses all that soapy goodness. Then were will you be? Trying to wedge that stupid-ass hand soap dispenser into the Dimension of Yig that is the medicine cabinet, that's what. Jeez. Now you gotta open the mirror every time you want to wash your hands! This is worse than life in a Stalinist Gulag! Why couldn't you buy a soap dish and some Zest like everyone else?   So on to the toilet. I know you were just waiting for that one. There's no cabinets in this dump (get it), just a little plastic table that's good for piling magazines on and shoving cleaning paraphenalia under. Since there's no cabinets, there's no place to put the industrial-sized supply of shit-paper that bachelors are required by law to purchase. So it just sits there by the toilet, next to the garbage can, taking up space and bumping your ankles every time you sit down to do a number two. This is just improper crapper feng shui. And we won't even talk about what happens when the can of Scrubbing Bubbles knocks over unexpectedly.   Living in a basement doth have its advantages, such as being nice and cool in the summer, and warm and cozy in the winter, and you never have to worry about being trapped on the second floor of a burning building, as the flaming roof will cave in and kill you long before that. But the bathroom, in this particular case, is not one of them.   To paraphrase Herodotus, so much for the tale of the crapper.

      The following will serve as a prime example of why you shouldn't fulfill your public writing obligation while dead tired at two in the morning.   Yeah, and by "Daily Grind Ironman Challenge," what I  really  meant to say was, "Farcical Abortion To Be Abandoned Straight Out of the Gate," see. I know, there was a little confusion up front, there, ha-ha! Yeah, that title wouldn't fit in the little Blooger title field, that was the problem.   I have no excuses. Wait! That's not precisely true, I have plenty. It's just that none of them are any good.   I was working. Okay, that's a lie. I was dodging work. I was calling in sick. I was sitting by the phone with my stomach in knots, because I  hate  calling in sick, even when I am actually sick (which is not that often), but especially when I'm not actually sick. (The GF informed me the other day that she literally had never called in sick a single day when she wasn't. Can you even believe that? It seems un-American, somehow. I mean, calling in sick when you isn't is a time-honored  tradition , goddammit.) I can't come in, I got shingles, rickets, scurvy, piles, potato famine, the bends, the shakes, the quakes, and the blind staggers. Ugggh, *cough* I'm  really  sick, boss, so sorry. And then you hang up the phone and whoop with joy as you run into the sunshine, some new wave song playing on the soundtrack as you jump in your daddy's hot rod convertible and make for the beaches, daddy-O. Only there's a problem with the beaches, kids are turning up dead, and that crazy kid Scooter got found down by the water with big hives, and they think it has something to do with Commies or radiation and kids  really are getting sick , I think you see the irony here...  Okay, so I wasn't sick. I was busy. God dammit, that was a lie too. I wasn't  busy , for Christ's sake, I was calling in sick to work, how busy can I be? I was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer on DVD. I was watching my really pretty OpenGL screen saver and pretending I was stoned (stare at that fucking thing long enough and you will be). I was going out to dinner. Chicken Osaka, gin and tonic, Ayers Rock Strip cooked medium with mashed potatoes on the side, bow tie pasta with grated parmesan and little bits of roma tomato. There would have been dessert, but the crazy waitress didn't offer us any. Just, thank you for coming by,  sir , here's your ticket. Dessert? Would you like a bit of that parfait? Well, how about a nice bit of fuck off instead? Thanks for stopping by.  Fifteen percent?!    In addition to being very busy eating out, I was also winning many arguments over the Internet. Damn it, that's also a lie, I lost every single one of them. I'm still lying, I didn't even start any. I lurked, and I got mod points on Slashdot and I modded some guy as flamebait and troll because I could, and I will admit, it was a personal vendetta because he is an officious fat fuck and I hate him like fire and I lay awake nights trying to think of ways to thwart him personally, and as I ponder this I grind my teeth, which has resulted in some huge dental bills, lots of experiments with little mouth guards and stuff, none of it to any avail. Sorry, still lying.   Okay, I'll fess up, I was busy enriching myself personally. I've been buying books up the proverbial ying-yang, you see. I bought a thick volume entitled The Sagas of the Icelanders, which is not bad fiction even though it might sound like it, but actual historical literature. I also bought a Guide to the Ancient World, the Field Guide to Demons, Cryptozoology A to Z, Bullshit's Mythology -- sorry I meant Bulfinch, I can just never resist making that joke every time -- not to mention a thick volume on Cagliostro which will provide me with endless oodles of dinner-time conversation. I put it right next to my Big Book of Jungle Rot and The Complete Idiot's Guide to Torture Methods in Turkish Prisons. Fuck, I'm fibbing again! Sure, I bought all those books. Spent a mint on the fucking things. Right now they're holding the bookshelf down, pretty much. I've read barely a word of any of them. I might as well use them to put my drinks on. Which, incidentally, I've done.   Speaking of which. the real reason I haven't been writing is because I have been  loaded . Tanked. Sloshed. Up to the gills. Three sheets to the wind. On a bender. Blotto. Plowed. Ripped. Stand-up, sit-down, shit-faced pants pissing drunk and making a lot of noise, opening my window and shrieking into the 3 am night air that I'm so fucking drunk right now I'll fight anybody on this block! And then anybody on the block shows up and I'm in big fucking trouble, because I couldn't fight off an ear infection with a bloodstream so full of gin that I'm shitting pine needles. I got so plastered I couldn't even remember my own name, and started getting nostalgic for things that weren't even in my particular cultural vocabulary, and started putting lampshades on my head and prancing around the room shrieking "23 -- Skidoo" at the top of my lungs, telling people that I'd been "ossified" and saying "banana oil" and getting together with all the "shieks" and "shebas" and the flappers down at the Cotton Club and -- look, nevermind, all this shit is made up too and I think we've both known it for several sentences now.   Although I  did  get really ripped the other night, and watched a movie about a black man who escaped from prison and became a karaoke champion, and got shot by the cops while singing "Freebird" a capella. It had Huey Lewis in it, who by the way has turned into a human catcher's mitt. So big, so leathery, never has any movie screen held so much face at one time. There was also a bit about the deleterious nature of suburban overachievement on the human psyche, but I forget, because by that time I'd polished off most of a bottle of Bombay Sapphire and was chiefly concerned with how to get to the bathroom without my pants falling down -- I've been losing some weight you see; it's part of a rigorous training program I'm undergoing, which mostly involves skipping the calorie-heavy Guinness and going straight for the hard stuff. I have seen the future of weight loss, and it is Sammy Hagar doing yowling knee-bends as he chugs Cabo Wabo "Vitamin T."   So yeah, I wasn't writing because I've been watching movies and getting smashed. And oh, what movies they have been, but that's a subject for next time.

      Good evening.  Tonight, we're going to watch a movie together. Or, rather, I will watch a movie and tell you all about it. Whether you like it or not. (You can always stop reading.) Tonight, I'm watching Halloween III: Season of the Witch.  Yes,  on purpose, dammit!   At this point, your typical Internet movie reviewer is supposed to say something witty and insightful, like "this movie is way worse than Hitler," or "Moustapha Akkad needs to be strung up by the balls and shot with a speargun." But the truth is, the movie is a delight of preposterous caricatures and unintentional irony.   (And not only that, but just this very minute, I discovered that Halloween III is the origin of a particular soundbite from Doubting Thomas' single "Father Don't Cry."   "All I can tell you mister, is watch out. You seen the TV cameras yet? He's watching you, friend, I can guarantee you that."  For years I've wondered where that sound bite came from, and I am deeply satisfied to know its origins, which I will probably forget the next time I hear the song and claw my own eyes out in sheer frustration. 1 )  But anyway, the movie. It opened with a man running pell-mell through a junkyard, and went downhill from there. I'd recap the plot, but there's not much point. Okay, you twisted my arm. A toymaker is making an army of evil robots and manufacturing KILLER HALLOWEEN MASKS that are going to blow up and kill all the kids on Halloween night. It's up to a divorcee doctor with bad 80s hair and his frequently-naked mistress to save the day. With me so far? Good.   So far, we have a delightful array of cliches. We have the "intense" doctor who can't say any of his lines without seeming completely unconvincing. We have a Wry Old Coot with a ridiculous, overwrought Irish brogue. He is really more suited to selling Lucky Charms than running a fleabag motel in Something's Wrong With This Town, USA. We have a Bitter Old Drunk Who Knows The Real Story Behind This Creepy Little Town. (Not surprisingly, he is Killed For What He Knows.) We have a nice middle-aged saleslady who's so sweet and nice she might as well stencil VICTIM on her forehead. We have a bunch of creepy, foreboding, emotionless guys in suits (obviously a precursor to  The Matrix ; Joel Silver gonna sue somebody), and the heroic trio of horror moviemaking: Dipshit Dad, Oversexed Yet Unattractive Mom, and Hellion Kid on a Bike. Hellion Kid on a Bike even flips his mom the bird! Youth today!   We also have a Concerned Daughter Turned Raging Slut, whose involvement in the film is ridiculous and mostly academic, but DID give rise to an anemic and totally uninteresting sex scene, the highlight of which comes when the doctor asks the post-coital zinger, "Wait a minute, how old are you?" Oh, it's a little too late to start worrying about statutory laws now, Dr. Mullet.   Among the major themes of this film, by the by, is an annoying jingle that won't stop playing, laser beams that shoot out of shamrocks and blow middle-aged salesladies' faces off 2  (sorry to spoil that for you), and robots that twist off people's heads for no particular reason. You can tell they're robots because their performances are emotionless and wooden. Actually, maybe I'm not so sure they're robots (Hyuk.) Dan O'Herlihy is a "laff" riot as Ronny Cox "lite," doing his "I'm a polite, genteel old man who is not in any way a murderous psychopath bent on world domination through a rigorous application of laser-shooting shamrocks and cheap latex masks."   And now here's the Strident Old Waitress who's being played by some unholy offspring of Carol Channing and Rob Halford. Her vulture-like face will haunt my dreams forever. And Buddy Kupfer is a low-budget Buddy Ebsen, on his way to his startling sophomore effort, "The Adventures of the Two-Minute Werewolf"! You don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, do you? Look, it's just some expendables come to give their expository dialogue. Pay them no mind.   At the beginning of Act Two, we are treated to a heart-pumping rocket ride detailing how to make latex Halloween masks. When this movie was in the theaters, they must have had nurses on duty to take moviegoers' pulses. Oh, wait, now I see. It's a plot to laser all the kids' heads off with  killer laser-shooting shamrocks ! I bet you think I'm making this up. Now Dan O'Herlihy is literally rubbing his hands together with Snidely Whiplash-like glee, mugging it up like a low-rent Vincent Price.   Well, now the heroes have discovered the evil plot. What's their solution? Call the Marines. "It's time to call the Marines," says Doctor Statutory. I guess they must just have an 800 number somewhere that you dial to deploy their asses to crazy old backwoods towns run by Dan O'Herlihy. But -- oh no! He can't call the Marines, the phone's not working! Damn horror movie phones! Give me my dime back!  Now the robot guys in suits are lined up in the street looking like they're about to perform "Leave It" by Yes. You really have to be here for this. And  now  the actors are driving cheap subcompacts around town to the tune of epic John Carpenter theme music.  Doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo DOO doo, doo DOO doo (loop for fifteen minutes)....   And now we have a guy running through a junkyard again, trying to escape from Jon Anderson and the Agents. Coincidentally enough, his aimless wandering brings him right to the Evil Villain's Complex, which he immediately (and effortlessly) breaks into and starts poking around.   I feel I should mention that up until now, there has not been one legitimately creepy moment in this entire movie. Unintentionally comical, sure, got that in spades, but nothing really creepy. Not until Doctor 80's Mustache walks into a room where a pale old woman is sitting at her chair, mechanically knitting, unresponsive to his bellowed demands for information. When he grabs her to shake her, her head merely rolls off onto the floor as the hands continue knitting -- because she was a  robot , you see. I will admit, that was good stuff.   But now Dr. Razortie has been discovered -- the jig is up, and he is fighting the bastard child of Charles Bronson and Harry Reems and we're back to unintentional comedy again. You punch him and nothing happens! Because he's a robot! Or because your air-punches are missing him by a country mile.   Whoa, punch a robot hard enough and they belch up mouthfuls of honey mustard. Fun fact.   And now Dr. Hat-Hair has been captured by the robotic goons. I guess we can start the countdown until Dan O'Herlihy starts reciting his villanous plan to kill all the kids with laser shamrocks. I'm going to go with two minutes, tops. With time out for him to deliver this somnambulistic tirade about the rare old knitting lady robot being made in 1765 in Munich. Really, you can make anything seem vaguely creepy, and yet lend it historical legitimacy, if you say it was made in Munich, or perhaps Vienna. But not, say, Lichtenstein. Look for more unintentional comedy here as O'Herlihy delivers a big old speech, turns theatrically to face Dr. Magnum P.I., who has been standing in the center of the frame for the last six minutes, and says "Oh! There you are, Doctor!" Jeez.   (Here we fade out to a sunrise, and a nice insulting card saying: "SATURDAY, OCTOBER 31st." Beat. "HALLOWEEN." Thanks. How would I have known when Halloween was otherwise, or what movie I was watching, or even where the hell I am?)  And it looks like we're going to get the Villain Plot Explanation in under two minutes after all -- "ancient technology," he chuckes indulgently as they walk through a room full of blinky 80s computer consoles. "A good magician never explains his secrets," he said. Or a bad screenwriter, apparently.   And now it's revealed that the Halloween laser-shamrock plot has something to do with this toy company stealing a piece of Stonehenge. Yes, you heard me right. They just  made off with a chunk of Stonehenge . No one noticed, I guess. Help yourself, you know?   Oh man -- it looks like Hellion Kid is about to get it. They're arranging a "demonstration" where they strap the killer shamrock mask to the kid's head and -- oh, this should be good. Why they are doing this? Who cares, as long as that kid gets it... oh, and he did. Thanks to the magic of Stonehenge, the kid's Halloween mask melted his head and replaced it with some molasses, several insects, a rattlesnake, some baby eels, and a large tortoise. OK, I'm kidding. About the tortoise. The rest is real. Buddy Ebsen is none too pleased. Now if only they could play the theme from "Benny Hill" during this, it the scene would be perfect.   Whoops, Dipshit Dad just got bitten by the rattlesnake that came out of his son's head. And crazy synthetic calliope music is playing. And Dr. Lobster is raising his fists in what I'm sure is supposed to be rage or hate or moral despair or something -- instead it just looks like he's trying to pantomime not being able to do one single pull-up.  Acting!   And now we fade in to a montage of kids from coast to coast -- which looks like it was all shot in the same four-block radius -- putting on their Silver Shamrock masks in preparation to get their heads melted. Still no clear reason as to why anyone would blow the heads off every kid in the US on Halloween using secret Stonehenge technology -- I guess "hell, why  not? " is kind of like a reason, but -- still. Am I asking too much of the third Halloween movie? I guess I am.   Well, with Doctor Stetson impotent with horror, it looks like it's up to Nurse Sexy Redhead to save the day. Did I tell you about Nurse Sexy Redhead? Well, it barely matters, looks like she's about to get fried by the robots. Damn. He's gonna kill her with a coffeepot -- no, wait, a power drill. Yup, power drill. Oh, and right in the ear, too. But the camera tastefully cuts away. Jerks.   Sigh... and now the little cards are telling us what  time  it is. It's 7:30! Thank you, helpful subtitles! I think this is a countdown. To something. I'm not sure what.   Oh, wait, wait... it's now been officially established by the movie that we don't need a reason for this massacre.  "Why, Cochran? Why?"  "Do I  need  a reason?"   That will teach me to wax sarcastic. Apparently it's a big practical joke. Or, no, wait -- it has to do with "the ancient tradition of Halloween." Well, here comes another diatribe filled with Ancient Celtic Secrets and wattle-and-daub huts and the "hills running red with the blood of children." Yeah, that'll happen. I'm not even going to go into detail. Even O'Herlihy looks like he isn't buying it, and he's the one delivering it!. In the end, he claims that he's going to kill the children, really, just for no reason at all... "In the end, we don't decide these things... Moustapha Akkad does!" No, I mean "the planets do!" So, you're gonna kill all the kids because of astrology. Okay.   And now he walks out of the room, leaving Doctor Guy with a laser-shamrock mask attached to his head, so that he will be killed with all the rest when the end comes... the suspense is palpable. And stuff. Now a blank-faced guy in a lab coat is pushing on one of those 80s blinky computer consoles. God I love those things. They exist nowhere else but in crap 80s movies.   Oh, but the "joke" is on Dan O'Herlihy, because the good doctor is now making his escape! How? Look, don't ask. Let's just say airshafts are involved. And there's a lot of crawling in them. A whooole lot of crawling in them.   Just for the heck of it, I'm gonna call that Dan O'Herlihy is actually himself a robot, right now. I'll check in with myself later to see if I was right.   So. Doctor Backsweat escapes from the airshaft long enough to -- I'm not making this up -- get on the phone and argue with his ex-wife. "I'm not drunk!" he stage-whispers into the phone. "Go to hell!" she barks, as all good, strident ex-wives do, and so he traipses off to save the unconscious love interest from a stainless steel lab table. And now comes the inevitable "running through corridors" scenes, the only real follow-up to the "crawling around in airshafts" scenes. I'm going to level with you, if this goes on a whole lot longer I'm going to start lasering my  own  face off.   Now here's a bit where our heroes hide behind a box waiting for a guy to walk by. And now they do it again. And again.   And here's the bit where the doctor sneaks back into the control center, instantly learns the mechanics of the computer system, climbs some stairs, and drops a box full of laser shamrocks on the bad guys -- as they  stand there and watch him do it . Wow. This truly is a cadre of well-trained murderous automatons. They stand idly by and watch their own death warrant being signed. I guess no one old them about Asimov's Three Laws.   Everything's blowing up now. And, well, another guy just puked up some honey mustard. That's gotta be worth something. And Cochran just stands there watching, as that synth calliope music just plays on and on. I could watch this all day. I feel like I'm probably gonna be.  Oh -- and now the finale -- KILLER STONEHENGE!!! The piece of Stonehenge is gonna kill the big bad doctor -- on general principles! And he just gave Doctor Biscuit a golf clap for defeating him! And there's a big matte projection of them running away from a rotoscoped explosion and -- wow. I have no words. Seriously.   Well, Dan O'Herlihy's dead. He wasn't a robot. But -- oh no! The love interest was! As they're driving away from the big, bad, blowing-up factory, she attacks him! The car crashes! She's gonna puke up honey mustard any second! And then he caves her skull in with a tire iron. And there's the honey mustard. And he thinks it's over -- but then he's attacked by the robot girl's severed arm! And the scene stretches on, kind of interminably, and I'm starting to wonder why I'm alive -- and now he's attacked by the robot girl  again ! This is like four times now! This movie just keeps on hating me!  The finale is finally upon us. The doctor runs to a gas station, to there badger an incredulous attendant and call "the TV station" and tell them to pull all the killer commercials off the air. Again, there's just this number you dial, and you get the guy in charge of taking all the shit off the air. But the guy won't! And the synthetic calliope music starts playing! And so the movie ends, with the doctor screaming "Stop it, stop it, stop it!" into the phone, cut to black, and I think i agree with his sentiment, wholeheartedly.   And that's Halloween III, everybody. Thanks for stopping by.       1  And immediately scream "I can still see!" Like the unshot ending to  X, The Man With The X-Ray Eyes .    2  Her name is Marge. What are the chances, huh?

      Last night, I watched  Last House on the Left . Recommended by Netflix and apparently legendary amongst horror-film afficionados,  Last House  was banned for 30 years in the UK, and is infamous for its brutality and "shocking" content, as well as its tag line: "To avoid fainting, keep telling yourself, 'it's only a movie, it's only a movie....'"The DVD even includes an introduction by Wes Craven himself, warning off small children, sensitive animals, and people with delicate psychological constitution. Should be juicy stuff, right?  Yeah. Now, the hip thing to do, when someone sees a "shocking" or notorious film for the first time, is to poo-poo it out of hand for not being shocking at all. This is easy.  I Spit On Your Grave ? Fakey.  Ilsa, She-Wolf of the SS ? Dude, I've been in a German death camp, they look nothing like that.  Triumph of the Will ? Nazis aren't  real!   Irreversible ? Funny as hell!   See? Easy. I'm not going to do that. In fact, I'll tell you right now, there are some things about this movie I did, in fact, find genuinely disturbing. Just, maybe, not what you might think.   But first, I'm going to spoil the plot. So, if you're interested in seeing this movie (which, by the way, I'm not going to recommend at the end of all this, just so you know), don't read any of this next paragraph, because I'm going to give away the whole shebang. I'm starting now. Ready?   OK. Two young girls go out in the woods, to the tune of shitty Seventies music, to find some "grass" and go to a Bloodlust concert. Sadly, they are kidnapped by a band of murderous psychopaths (actually not kidnapped so much as "walked right into their house to buy drugs"), and the torment begins. The girls are taken out to the woods, taunted, forced to piss themselves, stripped, mutilated, forced to perform sexual acts on each other, raped, and finally murdered. The killers then wander a few dozen yards to the house where the parents of one of the girls live (!). The parents, through a contrivance that could generously be called shaky, discover that these people killed their daughter. The parents then go on a murderous rampage to avenge their daughter. The husband kills one of the guys with a chainsaw, while the wife, outscoring her husband two-to-one, cuts one of the other murderers' throats and kills a second with what is best described as a lethal act of fellatio. No, I'm not kidding. The cops show up too late in time to stop the carnage, some Strawberry Alarm Clock plays, and that's the end.   End spoilers.  Now, admittedly, this sounds pretty disturbing on paper. Indeed, most of the special features are all about Wes Craven, his producer, and the badly aging actors talking about how disturbing everyone found it -- people throwing up, walking out, fainting, and so forth. In fact, they all go so out of their way to unabashedly  overrate  the film that I almost started to think I should have liked it more than I did. But no. No, I didn't.  Granted, a few things absolve this movie from total condemnation. One, it really was daring at the time, and a little out there even today, where graphic impalements or dismemberment is more or less de rigeur even in mainstream action flicks. Two, it was Wes Craven's first film, and frankly, he's been pretty much downhill from there, so there's that. And three, there are a few scenes that manage to be effective, even if they aren't the world-changing watershed moments the cast and crew apparently believe them to be.  But mostly, this film is unbelievable schlock. The music is tremendously dated -- from weepy, unintentionally comical "love ballads," to something that can only be described as a cross between something from  Deliverance  and the theme from "Benny Hill," the musical score ranges from the merely inappropriate to the criminally insane. The movie being from the early Seventies does not rescue it from this criticism -- I've seen plenty of movies from the Seventies that had scores that stood the test of time. I don't know how the crew thought the hipness of this score would even survive its own theatrical run.   Besides the execrable score, there is the improbable dialogue and the unconvincing acting, which in its own way does the audience a mercy by helping undermine and sap the strength from the tension. Every time a scene starts to make you uncomfortable, the movie will switch away to the Keystone Kops-style antics of the inept police officers (including a nearly unwatchable portion where they try to hitch a ride on a chicken truck), or a scene of slap-bass-accompanied marital hijinks so over the top, it's nearly impossible to believe that it's meant unironically.   And this is the bit that got me to thinking. I've never been a huge fan of Wes Craven's work. As an old friend so succinctly put it to me years ago, "he's never been afraid to take a chainsaw to a good script."  The Nightmare on Elm Street  series, I've watched little of and can do without.  The Serpent and the Rainbow  was good, right up until "Telepathic Nut Nail," and then it was all out the window. The entire  Scream  series is unmitigated shit. So that leaves what?  Shocker ? Bleh. Did you know I once heard Wes Craven on Larry King Live, saying that he thought Horace Pinker was a bigger, badder villain than Freddy Kreuger? Now, keep in mind, this is the villain who gets stopped by a  television remote control . Oh, who am I kidding? No one fucking saw  Shocker .   Anyway, Wes Craven's work has always been characterized by a certain goofiness, a smarmy, just-kidding undertone that, in my opinion, often keeps his work from being as scary or engaging as it could be. Even in this, his first film, there's many attempts at humor -- most of which fall very flat -- but I can't tell whether it's sheer ineptitude or a sort of early post-modern genius that drives these moments.  Last House  is an incredibly brutal film, yet so cliched and amateurish on some levels that it almost becomes an unwitting lampoon of itself.   But, an interesting insight into the director: in one of the interviews on the  Last House on the Left  DVD, Craven talks about filming some of the most gruesome scenes of the film, and says, "When the shooting was over, no one said a word... everyone was silent. I knew that we'd reached a dark place... and while I thought it was important to go there in making this film, I never wanted to go back to that place... and I never have, ever since."   Which explains a lot about Wes Craven's filmmaking since those days. That alone nearly made this movie worth the price of admssion.   Later: John Carpenter.

      Crimson Land!  As a kid, I was a big fan of Robotron. I also loved Defender and Galaga and Galaxian, and (I'm a little ashamed to say) Gorf. (I mean, really, Gorf was the bastard stepchild of other, slicker games. It was like the dim younger brother you keep locked in his room when company comes over.)   As a general rule, where video games were concerned, I loved anything with spaceships and / or lasers. No matter how intrinsically shitty the game, if it had lasers or spaceships, it was almost never bad. You could keep your Pac Man and your Q-Bert and your Zookeeper with your cute little animals gobbling up or stomping on abstract objects. Fuck all that. What's important is that something  dies . Preferably with a large and well-animated explosion.   Just because I loved these games does not mean I am any good at them. I played Defender and Defender: Stargate on and off for much of my young life (and, thanks to MAME, quite a bit of my later life too). I still suck at it. As a boy, and then an early teen, I would stand by and watch other guys save dozens of humans, rise in the levels, see enemies I'd never even seen except on the little animated screen that tantalizes you, mockingly, with the rumors of their existence. They would hit the high score and keep on going, fingers madly slapping the keys, reversing their ship and firing with an accuracy my meaty digits could only dream of.   But, over ten years of playing this game, and I still get my ass whipped on level one or two. It doesn't even matter that the controls are much less complicated now (the original stand-up arcade version must have had twelve buttons, for Christ's sake). Within minutes, I'm generally either dead, or doing what I usually do when I get frustrated: dropping down to ground level and blowing the fuck out of all the little humans I'm supposed to save. The planet would explode in a ball of pixelated fire, and you float in the merciless void, devoid of purpose or hope of salvation, as the alien assault descended. Then your game is over, you grab some Pixy Stix and a Big Hunk from the front counter and go the fuck home to play Star Wars Guys.   Now, Robotron. There was a game I could last awhile at. Sure, it still had innocent casualties to gun down, but I always had a somewhat better chance of saving them. Actually, I'd usually only save about one or two, the rest falling to "friendly fire," as they were too goddamned stupid to get out of the way when, you know, an invincible army of killer cyborgs is milling all around them and a guy with a gun that fires  four directions at once  is spraying laser willy-nilly at  everything . Talk about burning the village in order to save it. The cure is almost worse than the disease.   I've often wondered what kind of crack-addled Walter Mitty universe these little digital people lived in, that they could traipse along, whistling blithely, as monstrous robot death bore down on them from all sides. Especially when the little triangular robots spawned the fast and accurate Human Killing Whirly Thingy. What's really funny, of course, is  the "story" behind Robotron :   The year is 2084. Technology and advancement are at a dangerous peak when man perfects the ultimate species. A species so advanced that man falls victim to his own creation - the ROBOTRON. Guided by their infallible logic, the Robotrons concluded: the human race is inefficient and must , therefore, be eliminated. Due to genetic engineering error, you possess Superhuman powers. Your mission: to stop the Robotrons and save the last of the Human Race. You are the only hope for mankind!   Now, let's examine this for a minute. First of all, the humans from the game invented the Robotrons? These guys can't even get out of the way of a moving milk truck. Second of all, their savior was not genetically modified to save them -- that was an  accident . "Ha-ha, well, Mr. Walton, there's been a little 'oopsie' down at the lab... we gave you superhuman reflexes and a four-way laser! Gosh, sorry. I know, you just wanted green eyes, I don't know, I've just been so brain-dead lately with these long hours and..."   Not to mention the fact that you're laboring so intensely to destroy the evil Robotrons to save -- well, frankly, a race of what one can only conclude are blind, deaf, autistic morons -- lends a certain sense of bathos to the whole affair.   Still, lasers. Huh? And don't even get me started on Galaxian and Galaga and their orderly formation attacks against an army of one. I guess the supposition is that in the future, the admiralty of the alien space armadas will be manned entirely by control-freak interior decorators.   But anyway. I started thinking about all this because I saw an ad online and started playing the demo of  Crimsonland , which reminds me a lot of good ol' Robotron in many ways. You're a single soldier trying to survive in a world full of hostile, Starship-Troopers-like aliens who attack for no particular reason. Thankfully, your guy is neither the subject of accidental genetic tampering by a race of cretins, nor beholden to save said cretins from their own berserko creations. (Hey, speaking of berserk, how about Berzerk? There was another cool game.) All you have is your trusty limitless ammunition and an endless supply of handy power-ups, thoughtfully dropped by your attackers upon their deaths. Those marauding bands of murderous aliens -- always so helpful in a pinch.   Unlike Robotron, this game is full of carnage; it's a little less frenetic than its spiritual successor, but makes up for it in sheer relentlessness. In addition to the very fun shotgun, assault rifle, flame thrower, and "nuke" weapons, there are a variety of "perks" you get for surviving the game and collecting experience, such as fast reloading, extra ammo, or the ability to shoot faster. (Really, don't we all want to shoot faster, deep inside?) The demo only gives you one lousy life, but if you've played a lot of Robotron in your youth, you should be able to give the alien bastards a run for their money.   Not bad, for having neither spaceships nor lasers. I guess you can't have everything.
