      Life is so full of seasons. After winter, I've finally got a few irons in the fire that are firing my passion for living/ I can actually say I'm enjoying life many times a day. It's been a rough road to this place, and I have many moments, or hours where I still feel a little wacky (as in psychologically deficient, not just artistic-weird). But having been in this valley, I feel I can empathize with weakness, lonlienss, and a sense of lostness even though I'm eternally saved.   Am I at least just a bit more humble?  Am I slower to be critical of weakness in others?  (Okay, I admit. UNLESS it is poor customer service, or stupidity) Am I a better encourager.  Am I maybe even more Christlike?

      Dearest Heavenly Father,   How my heart aches for Anne. You know her hurts and loneliness so much more  intimately than I can. I pray that your Holy Spirit, you've also called THE COMFORTER would this very hour, and through the days as they become weeks, bring Anne great comfort and peace (you promised that too!).    In faith we believe that it is NOT your plan for us to be discouraged, and feel defeated, but to take courage in the reality that there is a Creator God who is not just some cosmmic force, but our Heavenly Father to whom we can call "daddy," and talk to honestly about our deepest fears and pain. In faith we trust the Bible that tells us the fullness of you can (does!) indwell us.    You are with us every minute of every day. You are great, and you are mighty to save. You take great delight in us, you want to shower us with your love, and you rejoice over us with singing (Zeph 3:17). Lord so often we listen to the enemy who wants us to be defeated, discouraged, weary and disillusioned. Help us have the discipline to read Your Word and let you remind us of your promises, let the living and active "sword of the Spirit" fill our minds so that there is no room for Satan's lies. We want to have victory over the darkness and freedom in Christ. And we pray for that knowing it is your will.   I confess we get our eyes focused on other PEOPLE who don't live up to our expectations of what we think they should be, or we have our eyes focused on ourselves -- because life can be so "in your face" that we have a hard time seeing anything but the tyranny of the urgent, or this temporary struggle of our earthly existence...   Help Anne and I to keep our Focus on YOU! Help us to remember to keep talking to you; to not be too proud or busy or angry with you to crawl into your lap (we can imagine that at least) and talk to you...and help us to remember often to BE STILL and listen, feel for your comfort, your voice,...just like you commanded in Your Word: BE STILL AND KNOW that I am God. Like John Nash said in the movie A BEAUTIFUL MIND, we need a "diet of the mind." Grow in us the discipline of our minds to not listen to our enemy who knows our weaknesses and will never give up attacking us in those places until we are safe in your arms.    AMEN."     Anne,  I have found the book THE APPLAUSE OF HEAVEN so comforting and pastoral to me this past year. Another easy to read, but truth filled book by Max Lucado...it is one of his earlier books that I had not read until this year. If you haven't read it, I would highly recommend it!   Much love, K!Mberly

      Jim’s hobnobbing with SW People’s advocates out-of-country this week in Chiang Mai… I think they were smart to ask him to facilitate the planning of it this year. It is SO up his alley in networking. Yeah JIM!  Kids are still in Singaporean school and this week will finish their second full year: K1, and P2. Tyler still complains about the Chinese writing but gets lots of kudos around town everyday for his verbal skills, so that helps (though I CRINGE at his Guandong accent!!). We have made a few friends in the neighborhood and actually found some little boys to play with, in our building, who converse at home in Mandarin, AND are about the same age. Never mind that they are physically & verbally abusive of their poor mother, and only like to play Nintendo, watch Digimon, or eat junk food. When Tyler and Cameron go up to those kids house (not super often thank goodness) I am on my knees!  I’ve found a few theatre friends, which has helped my outlook on everything else! They needed me as much as I needed them and I’m regaining some of my dormant passion. I was starting to worry that those kinds of “go for it” feelings were going to end up only in the history of my youth and young adulthood. I’ve been teaching a class on Playwriting. I agreed if they would call me a facilitator instead. I DON’T do lectures. 30 adult believers from a number of clubs here in town…and they are learning a lot (So am I – Having people “write from what they know, about values or issues important to them gives great insight into the culture!). They are really hungry to have a creative outlet! But they have a LONG way to go!  Still plugging away at learning Chinese – trying to keep up with Tyler’s P2 studies. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that we’d come back to live in the motherland someday. But for now we’ll just have to visit, and keep our hearts open and vision clear. We’ve sure missed the adventure of China. Singapore is stifling!

      1 November 2001  Dear Crystal,  We so often think of you and hope you are doing well. It is nearly a month before Cameron turns 5 and you will be so pleased to hear that he is growing into such a fine little boy. I wish I had time right now to make a picture review of his year, like I did last year, but it’s been a busy season, and I’ve had some computer problems…so, I’ll get this written now, and find the right pictures to catch you up on your most beautiful creation.   He is still the MOST delightful little boy I’ve ever known. His kindergarten teacher says that he starts her day every morning by telling her how wonderful and beautiful she is. Though he is the youngest in his class, in a bi-lingual school, he is not just keeping up, but doing as well as any of the other kids. He is now reading very simple books – has learned how to sound out English words, and he recognizes many Chinese characters too. He’s learning a little Malay/Indonesian too! He can write (even has spelling tests!) in both Chinese and English. He also loves memorizing verses (see the list of those he’s committed to memory – he’s quite amazing!) We have a chin up bar at home and he’s learning to pull up on it to build his muscles. He wears one of his 3 Superman costumes almost every day.  Like a typical little brother, he follows what big brother likes and so we have a lot of talk in our house about Digimon and Pokemon (cartoons) and Dinosaurs. This year Cameron is now old enough to play together with Tyler and since they have similar interests, they are very cute when they are getting along (they bicker quite a bit, but that’s pretty normal. They love each other a lot too!). We spend a lot of play time building forts out of mattresses and sheets, and dressing up in costumes.  We had a great time this summer in California – Disneyland, Legoland, California Adventure, a trip up the coast, to the mountains, on a boat, on the train…It was a perfect 6 weeks, crammed full of adventure and love from Grandmas and Grandpas, Uncle and Aunt, cousin (Cade now 2), and loads of friends who wanted to spoil the children!   We’re looking forward to a visit over Thanksgiving from my parents. We’re counting the days until they come! This year we will go to China in December, Indonesia & Malaysia in January, and to Venezuela in June next year. Hope to fit a trip to Cambodia in there too as the boys have some missionary friends who live in there.  So he’s going to need new pages in his passport soon! Tyler has begun doing some commercial work for the Disney channel (the satellite in Singapore serves all of Asia, Middle East and Australia, so Tyler has been in some ads for Australian market), Cameron is so photogenic, but is a bit camera shy. He’s wowed the directors, but still doesn’t want to cooperate in camera. I bet this year he’ll get some work too – he’s so adorable when he puts on the charm!   He still loves puzzles. He has started to play some educational computer games. Luke is still his best friend, but he often talks of a girl named Vanessa in his class…he   says he likes her because she’s fat! His best friend in school is a little boy from Hong Kong. So, Cameron is learning to speak English with a Singaporean accent too.  We have a maid who lives with us (common in this part of the world!) and she loves the boys, and Cameron LOVES her too. She didn’t get passed 1st grade in Indonesia, so she likes learning things with him.  If you saw him you’d probably see things about his personality that are a lot like you! Since we didn’t know you very well, we wouldn’t see these things, but you would. They are surely there. He has the cutest way of praying, and running, and the positions he is in when he sleeps. He’s completely hopeless right now when it comes to eating neatly, but he is so polite, and sensitive. He is not easily offended, can be a great actor (when it comes to crying, or being punished, or caught doing something naughty), makes the funniest faces…  I imagine sometime this year he will begin to understand that a woman named Crystal Cooper brought him into this world, and gave us the precious privilege of raising him and having another son. He notices, but still doesn’t make an issue of why his skin is brown (beautiful, perfect skin, by the way!). He is surrounded by so many races, that he doesn’t feel different, and it hasn’t been an issue. He sometimes hears us use the word “adopted,” when people ask why he looks so different – but e often find that Asians don’t even consider this…they just think he doesn’t look as much like us as Tyler does! I am so glad for the very sweet letter you wrote to him, and the pictures you passed on. They will mean so much to him as he gets older.  You are, as always in our prayers with thankfulness.  These are the verses Cameron has memorized (New International Version)  Psalm 119:105			1 Chronicles 16:34 Mark 10:43			1 Peter 5:7&8 John 14:15			Matthew 6:9-13 Genesis 1:1			Psalm 119:11 Ephesians 6:1			Mark 10:27 Psalm 56:3			Psalm 100 Proverbs 3:5-6			Philippians 4:11b Ephesians 4:32			Galatians 5:22 Proverbs 15:1			1 Chronicles 4:10 John 3:16			Isaiah 41:10 Ephesians 6:10-11		Deuteronomy 6:5 Philippians 4:13		Psalm 133:1 Romans 5:8			Romans 3:23 Matthew 7:12

      Returning to our home from 1997-1999:   Kunming, China     The weather was beautifully cool and comfortable. Old friends were warm and welcoming.   Every desire "To do," "To see," or "To eat" while in China, was happily checked off the list.   In addition to old favourites, we also have some new friends, new experiences, and new things to love about our old city.   Our kids love China, too. Its a place where young boys can be BOYS (read: less civilized than what we work on in other places!). They got really dirty, ate sloppily, played rowdily and noisily, and ran around in public to the approval of the onlooking adults! Again They both got so much astonished affirmation for their Chinese language ability. We pray that this will buoy them through their Chinese studies in Singapore.   Jim had great meetings with in-country workers, good follow-up to the meetings he'd coordinated this fall.    There are growing signs of Plastic Christmas. Big blow up Santas. Little stuffed Santas. Tape-on-the-wall Santas. Gaudy tinsel garlands. Fake Christmas trees. Tacky ornaments, and "Merry Christmas" banners hung, sprayed or painted on lots of store windows. Commercial Christmas is catching on in a big way. And yet there was NO public sign of the star of Bethlehem, shepherds, wise men, or a baby in a manger.   For 3 weeks I'd carried in my purse some pretty little pages with the "Story of Christmas" in Mandarin Chinese. But in the entire time there I hadn't found any appropriate opportunity to give even one away.    Our last night we attended the 7th annual Christmas program for the International School (Primary through High School). This year it was held in a large hall at the Yunnan Arts Institute. The place was packed by the time we arrived, and I could only find seats at the back of the standing-room-only large auditorium. In the last row, I struck up a conversation with a number Chinese girls seated behind me. They were dance majors and had seen me the day before when I visited their campus. Behind them were 30 or more students from the Arts Institute who had also heard about the free program. The concert was lovely, and with the kindergarteners acting out the traditional Pageant, it very clearly told the Christmas story...in English. The students behind me were amazed at seeing a stage full of foreign kids singing, and portraying, and believing, this ancient story. When at the end, the audience of a few hundred, lifted the roof with harmonized Carols proclaiming the birth of Christ I knew it was mystifying to these young observers. Yet they didn't understand the words. "We don't know this story, but our English is too poor." They said to me. I reached in my bag and handed them the tracts. "I've got the story in Chinese here if you want it. You can give the rest to your friends in the back." They were so suprised, and thankful; and I passed them back with a prayer that continues for those little seeds planted.

      from an email to Elaine Bent in Texas.     E: I am glad you have met and are involved with some theatre people - both Chinese and American.  You need to have that involvement to feed the special talents God gave you.  Are the people in your class Chinese, Americans, or mixture?      K: All Singaporean Chinese. They speak English, but don't have the breadth of vocabulary we use. They've all learned a lot, and so have I. Expectations were a little high. No emerging playwrites out of the bunch, but every person grew creatively, and in their understanding of plays, and were glad to have taken the class. We'll see what develops in the future.    E: They are so lucky to have you to teach them script writing.  I wish I could be there for that class, too.  When you "go off" to write, do you have something special already in mind?      K: Usually some seed of something...theme, issue, conflict, circumstance. A few times we did helpful "flash writing" exercises. One we did was just like acting improvs. Everyone submitted character ideas, conflict, place, and positive and negative character qualities. Then they drew these slips and had to write a scene. It just got them writing about something. Which was the hardest for them to do - just START.    E: I can't believe BOTH of your boys are in school!  They do grow up so quickly. Do they go to schools which are taught in Chinese? (I am assuming that Singaporean use Chinese for their national language.  Am I correct?  I really don't know.)  Do you have to do some teaching of your own at home?       K: My boys schools are in English - and that is the National Language! (The English isn't always completely STANDARD English, but pretty good, just a strong accent, especially their classmates). They each have an hour+ of Chinese each day as part of the curriculum. All children must take Mother Tongue (one of three languages offered in the schools). Tyler says, can't I just call English my Mother Tongue and forget about Chinese? He and Cameron are both doing well. Their verbal skills are better than many of their classmates, and Tyler regularly scores in the high 80's on his exams (many of his classmates fail! - can you imagein faling a subject in 1st and 2nd grade?)    E: Do have a TV?     K: We have cable which offers a few extra stations. Cartoon network, National Geographic, etc. We're pretty well off in what we can get here. I have my mom tape The West Wing for me when she can. We are starved for intelligent conversation and bright friends with bigger vocabulary than most here, so we get our stimulation from having vicarious relationships with this TV President and his liberal staffers.

      How I have thought and prayed over your letter these last couple of weeks! I was so sorry to hear about how the economy has affected your financial stability, dreams, and not the least important your faith in God's goodness...  You said,  I LOOK AT PEOPLE LIKE YOU THAT SEEM SO STRONG IN THE LORD AND SO DEVOTED TO HIS PURPOSE AND THEN HAVE TO ASK MYSELF IF MY PROBLEMS ARE BECAUSE I AM TOO CAUGHT UP IN THE WORLD'S VALUES? LIVING IN PALOS VERDES AND BEING SURROUNDED WITH PEOPLE THAT SEEMINGLY HAVE MONEY TO SPARE AND MOMS THAT GET TO STAY HOME WITH THEIR KIDS AND TAKE TENNIS LESSONS.....I HONESTLY STRUGGLE WITH THE SIN OF ENVY AND JEALOUSY.  You are right to say that I don't know you well, but I do know you well enough to observe that you've faithfully been making lemonade for as long as I've known you. And it doesn't help to live where you do, and have all the tennis moms and PV Homes and school district etc etc to compare yourself too, and what with the Big PRAYER OF JABEZ being all the rage last year...how can you not get depressed when you feel you've been faithful to the Lord, and ask for fish, and get what seems like stones instead...YES! I do understand that.   I knew before we came back on our last visit to USA "home" in June that it would be was the first time I would wrestle with the green-eyed monster.I'd be seeing the lifestyles of my peers, and old friends, and what assortment of things their kids are involved in. I knew because I was experiencing such dissatistfaction with my own circumstances, I knew that the grass of PV would be MUCH greener!  Sitting here at home this month, reading through Christmas newsletters, gives me some of those feelings and doubts again...WHY are we investing our lives like this, when we could have had THIS???? And I revisit with the Lord what is important to HIM, and I feel confirmed in my life's decisions....and then I start wrestling with being judgmental!!! So, see, I'm not such a saint!!   I'm not going to be quick to say "Oh NO you're not too caught up in the world's values!" because I don't know what God's purposes are in bringing you two through this current valley. But I do know that an antidote is to get your eyes and heart off those who (seem to) have more, turn off the TV (with the ads), even go media free for a week or so, so that you don't get bombarded with what you don't have, or aren't like...and it that isn't weird or extreme enough, dedicate yourselves to praying this month for the poor, the destitute, the oppressed, the persecuted.God will use it to bring perspective to your current situation! In those years at RHCC as our friends nearly all bought houses, and we stayed in our apartment/condo, it always helped me to have friends and connections with people who had much less than I did!  There are so many more of these kinds of humans in this world than there are the kind who live in the neighborhoods just above you on the hill...that's such a minute percentage of these "haves" in the world. AND God's promises and love is just as profound and real to the rest of the world's population as it is to Americans, even the blessed welfare recipients in the USA who at least know there will be SOME money coming in. I feel like I'm lucky to have a relationship with the peasant mother of our babysitter in China; she rarely have more that potatoes to eat all year long (if that) and RADIATES the love of Christ, and is confident (most of the time) in his goodness to her. It is SUCH a matter of perspective isn't it? Ah, now I'm rambling... Bless you and keep faithful as you wrestle with these things.

       I'm just sending this to a few people who know me pretty well, and I know won't get freaked out by this letter!    Greetings from Singapore where though our work is heating up, it actually seems cooler everyday!   (Actually it's not, but our bodies are adjusting somewhat!)   We sent our pregnant helper Lili off to her home in Indonesia this morning and, barring an act of God, a new gal from Thailand will come next week...(though I am a bit guarded in being excited that we found a replacement so soon. Read: SHE ISN'T HERE YET!) Get this: Her name is LOONIE! The 9 months of delays last time we were looking for a maid was that we were holding out for a Mandarin speaking gal. This time there were actually a few options right away (could be because the economy is down?). So, they say she speaks Mandarin too (worked in a Taiwan factory for 3 years). We shall see!   Lili's had the SUPER intense kind of morning sickness where for weeks she can't keep anything down...all day and night, stays in a dark room, sleeps all the time. Bleeding stomach, raw throat, obviously no energy. We would have sent her home much earlier, but Chinese New Year made getting tickets a bit troublesome (impossible), with everyone traveling to hometowns for the holidays...She refused to see a doctor because a confirmed pregnancy would mean she could never return to work in Singapore. She's lost A LOT of weight and last weekend I was actually checking in on her to see if she was breathing still, thinking through who our guests have been. We might need them for witnesses that we were not mistreating her...in case she died! OKAY, now I know you're rolling your eyes that I'm such a "drama queen." I'm serious! It's been just a little scary.   Thankfully, she perked up a bit when we were able to get tickets confirmed on Monday, and I found some Ensure and she'd kept little bits of that down for the last 2 days. She's on her way home now with the last of her wages in hand. We'll continue to pray for her health, her future, her enduring commitment to follow Jesus in spite of the very hard life of poverty she has ahead. Last year we "adopted" a Compassion Int'l boy from Thailand (though evey one knows so little of our giving actually GETS to the kid, it is SO helpful in teaching the boys about giving and poverty for them to have the pictures and do the correspondence with this child). Waving goodbye to Lili, I wish there was a corruption-proof way to "adopt" her 8 year old boy and this baby on the way. But the Indonesian postal service is so corrupt, we all believe that the money would never get there, and then if it did, I don't know that she'd use it wisely (ie. she has no savings from working with us for nearly 2 years, but she's bought her family a TV and her boy has a new bike). The world is so full of poverty and people who don't make good decisions. God give us generosity and wisdom in how to truly HELP people!   This weekend, if you think of me, would you pray? On my 40th birthday, I'm conducting my first church drama workshop: "Beyond Bathrobes and Sandals." The one last October was postponned until now. I scheduled this one, so that I'd make sure that on my BIG DAY, I'd be doing something I like, with people who are fun and a couple who are friends! (OKAY McNair: so it's nothing like throwing a party for myself on the 50 yard line of the Colliseum...or Jim's Line Dancing party with 120 of his dearest friends, but it's the best we could manage here! And I'm not complaining!)    I've been a bit "blonde" about the administrative details, partly because the Enemy (grrrr) arranged for me to do all the housekeeping (let's not even talk about the 6 weeks of ringworm which has infected us...it IS GETTING BETTER). This has left me a bit unfocused the last few weeks. The other part is because having been let down a few times, I didn't want to put my heart and soul in it planning to the nth degree and have to change it at the last minute to accomodate for people not doing their part, or late registrations etc. (I'm sure you've had your share of those experiences even in the States, and I'm learning to flex with it here).    This MORNING after sending Lili off, while changing sheets to prepare for overnight guests, (yes that's right we have guests the next 2 nights), the church hosting the workshop called to say the space they'd offered last November (and confirmed a week ago) wasn't going to be available afterall. When I hung up the phone I had a hard time gearing up for the final administrative details of the workshop (as you may remember, administration is not a joy for me). I sat on my bed and asked the Lord, "Would it be a sin to open a bottle of wine at 9:30AM? Or should I just take a nap? Can I be angry and sin not?" Instead I read a bit of Ecclesiates about how life is vanity, and thanked him that through thick and thin He's my friend. Then, God arranged for better location (not just nicer, but free!) for the workshop before my boys got home from school!   There are 4 churches are sending teams (some really terrific adults, some who took my playwriting class last fall) for 3 training sessions. It has been really fun to plan it with 2 other Singaporeans who have become my dear friends in the process. So, I'm as Paul says, "knocked down, but [my sense of humour is] not destroyed."   (While I'm fretting my petty details, Jim has a big day today: He met for breakfast with retired Anglican Bishop Moses Tay. Perhaps THE MOST RESPECTED CHRISTIAN LEADER here. An ideal mentor if there is one! They met in order for Jim to ask him to be the President of the Board for CRM Singapore. We are pretty sure he will say yes. Jim then was hosting a luncheon for the SW China network of churches and agencies here who are collaborating on behalf of the advancement of God's kingdom in that part of the world. Pretty exciting!)   Gotta go now to do homework with those two little creatures I'm responsible to raise right.  (You got the New Years picture right? They are as smart as they are cute! Cameron just hobbled over to me leaning on a stick as a can and asked for money like a beggar. Children learn what they live...)   Have a great day dealing with your hassles!   LOVE from the other side of the pond,   K!Mberly

      I just put the boys to bed. They had a fun day. I did too.  But we're pooped.   First the Science Center (which is so well done here) which gives them a taste of science in their lives, and they always learn something new. We never stay too long, so we can go back again and again.   Then to Jurong Water park which the children loved, but was a guardian's nightmare. Due to the school holiday, the place was PACKED with rowdy kids of all ages and also full of those large innertubes konking into everyone. I'm surprised we found a locker! Kim had Luke and Addie (still not a swimmer), and I'd invited the Australian neighbor Jackie with her fearless toddler plus a 3 year old and 7 year old. All of our husbands are in Australia this week. We stuck together, and made clear to the children that we were not wandering off. We pow-wow'd and scared-them-silly about the dangers of the crowded pool, and made strict guidlelines for where they could go (ie, not past the light blue tiles (shallow section) in the wave pool).   We convinced the kids that one harrowing group-trip around the "lazy river" was enough. They didn't complain too much... because today it was "log jam river" with all the big clueless kids horsing around. For me, I was "ever dililgent lifeguard in the river" chasing/watching over the 4 boys while Kim and Jackie kept hold of the 3 little non-swimmers in a pretty swift current. We did the wave pool and spent time in the kiddie wading pool (even that was nerve wracking trying to keep tabs on where they were all the time). We took turns letting the big boys go with one of the moms down the tube slide in another pool. Phew! I was glad I'd only put 2 hours worth of parking coupons on the car!    Now the car is nearly out of gas and we're out of parking coupons. Tomorrow is the magic lantern show (a group from America who tours these authentic historical shows...part of a children's art festival), and Ty's TWO Disney shoots (Cam will stick with the Burchells after lunch while I take Tyler).   At bedtime we reviewed some Bible verses and listened to an Adventures in Odyssey CD set Tyler just got from FEFC (we've never had any of these and they are great!).   Then Cameron didn't want to pray. For the FIRST time. He usually eagerly goes first; and it always goes something like:   "Thear God, thank for this daaaay. Thank you for meeee. Thank you for I love my mom, and my daaaaad and my bruthurrrr. I love them. Thank you for I have a nice dog. And my maid Lili--I mean Loonie. Thank you that [something that happened or impressed him]. You are so biiiiiig [or mighty, or strong].  I love you God. Amen.   But tonight he was tight lipped.   I prayed then Tyler, and Cameron still said, "I don't want to talk to God."    I was lying on his bed with him tonight so I leaned over and whispered, "Is there something you did today that makes you embarassed to talk to God?"  "Yes."   "You know, you can tell God and me what you did, and ask him to forgive you, if you are sad you did something. He wants to forgive you, but you have to ask him to help you."   He took a deep breath, folded his hands across his chest and looked up in the dark and confessed his sins for the first time:   "Thear God. I know you don't like it today I go in the dark tile of the pool. Where it was deeper. My mommy said “no” and I did it. And I know it was scary with the water. And the kids. And when she said to stick together I didn't want to listen or have seff-control. I know the Devil is a roaring lion and he want to get me and devour. So please God, nex time, help me be seff-control. And I'm sorry God I want to make you happy.....Amen."   We lay there for a few minutes and had a little talk about what it was that scared him in the water, and why mommies and daddies, and God make rules that seem dumb, or not so fun, until we find out they were to keep us safe...and why we must learn self-discipline when we are 3...or 5...so that we learn to use our strength and God's strength together when we get big and the Devil's roaring gets louder, and his bites get more painful.    He's getting it; the little peanut. Hope it sticks.   More later. K!

       Evangelical Free Church of Fullerton's Newsletter   WHY DON'T YOU JUST POP ON OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD?   Singapore is positively exciting, exotic and really easy for even the most pampered tourist. In fact this little city/nation is practically perfect if you only stay for less than a couple weeks. From the northern part of Singapore you can see Malaysia, and from the south you can see Indonesia. So, while you're here, you may want to add a couple other stamps to your passport. You think Southern California is multi-ethnic? Wait ‘till you see Singapore! We’ve Chinatown, little India, Malay Village as tourist attractions, but it is a virtual mosaic as you walk along the streets. We’ve the world’s best zoo, terrific shopping, GREAT FOOD, and efficient and clean public transportation. Stay in a nice air-conditioned hotel and we’ll show you the many wonderful sights and give you a window into our lives here. Besides what you’ll find in the tourist books, here’s what else you’d get if we could host you here.   We may make you join us for a bit of Chinese studies. We’ll go over some new vocabulary, or sing along with some Chinese karaoke! In Singapore it’s not a necessity, but speaking Mandarin goes a LONG way with people we meet and work with. At a lunch last week a Singaporean asked me to order, hoping we might get some freebies thrown in! Children take compulsory "Mother Tongue" in school, which is either Mandarin Chinese (78%), Malay (15%), or Tamil - an Indian language (7%). They take school pretty serious here, as well as instilling National pride in the children. It is quite a sight to pop by school at the end of the day and see the flag lowering ceremony with 1000 children singing the National Anthem. Our children are nearly the only Americans we know attending local schools; but so far, they are flourishing.  From this technologically sophisticated island, we spend a lot of time on the computer. Email is the way we do nearly EVERYTHING, even with Singaporeans; or SMS. Do you have that back home? My goodness, the way we send these messages back and forth! Sometimes I just think, “Dial the number and let’s TALK to each other!” And the Internet. Broadband! Wow! I even do much of my grocery shopping on-line. I don’t have to ever feel “out of the loop,” even living on the other side of the world! I have a database of sketches for worship on the web and people are downloading it from all around the world. Recently another Christian in theatre wrote me that his newest musical “Gospel Blues” was having it’s first showing and being broadcast over the internet from the Pacific Northwest. So, I didn’t even have to miss out on a premiere! Let’s all sing “It’s a Small World” shall we?   About bringing along a care package with food: NO need! We live out in the suburbs with Singapore’s "heartlanders" (ethnically traditional immigrants), but we have discovered many downtown stores cater to westerners. I stumbled upon a store a few weeks ago which had handmade tortellinis, escargot and a few other things I would never even buy from an Irvine Ranch or Bristol Farms! If we want it, and are willing to pay for it, many American food items can be found. After 5 years in Asia, we have become quite used to the foods here too. In fact, we prefer it! My little boys would rather have instant Chinese noodles over PB&J for lunch! We find we just don't crave old favorites, AND since there's no way you can bring us Krispy Kremes, we'll just have to keep satisfying the donut cravings when we're in the States!!!   As we’ve learned from living in Chinese culture, when it comes to eating out, we will fight you for the check! It is our pleasure to treat you, because God has been faithful to us. In fact, we have not yet had to re-use ANY tea bags. It is amazing & admittedly sometimes scary to live by faith as far as finances go. Like most missionaries, we are financially supported by individuals who sense God’s leading to be part of his work here). This still blows me away, even though it probably shouldn't. We have always supported other missionaries and still do. It's just kind of surprising when you're on the receiving end! We live like the average Singaporean in a Government Housing Apartment. We’re not extravagant, but we’re comfortable. AND HERE'S THE BEST PART (just so you’re not shocked when you visit): we have a live in domestic helper! YES! Someone else does my house work, and God has brought an honest, hard working girl we can trust. Isn't that strange? We live in what looks like a clean inner city ghetto – in groves of high-rise concrete buildings -- but nearly all the professionals who live around here (who don’t have extended family living with them), have foreign maids. So, as they say, “when in Rome…” It is quite a luxury!  But just so you don’t think it’s all wonderful, and plan your visit to be a more permanent one, I must warn you about adjusting to the life here. The HEAT and HUMIDITY is insufferable, you will have virtually no circle of friends or family as support, it is a crowded city culture where people have built not only high buildings but high walls around their hearts. They are very busy and don’t warm up to foreigners (‘cause most expats are here a short stint, stick together and don’t warm up to them). There are no babysitters. Singaporeans, if they do speak to you, love to comment on how easy it must be to adjust to their convenient lifestyle (not!). Honestly, after our 2 years of language study in China, I was really ready to get back to MINISTRY in Singapore! My husband and I had taken a year searching the world for where we BOTH could best use our experience and giftedness as missionaries. We’d sensed a clear leading that Singapore was the place and we moved to the suburbs to dive in to typical Singaporean life. But, while waiting for a suitable maid, homemaking means dishwashing by hand with no running hot water, more clothes to wash & iron because we sweat so much and the children wear uniforms to school, walking in the heat to and from the grocery store, mopping, lots of dust from local construction, and keeping track of children’s school bus schedules, (one son got home from school at 7:00PM!) To tell the truth, living here felt like a 4 star prison! I felt like I’d come to Asia to grow old. But God had (has?) some important whittling to do with my character, true love for him, and understanding that He doesn’t really give a hoot what I accomplish for him, but who I am in him. Sometimes this whittling has felt more like a sledgehammer (especially when we had daily jackhammering on our building for months on end). But having journeyed this valley, I feel I can better empathize with weakness, loneliness, and what it’s like to feel nearly hopelessly lost even though I'm eternally saved. I'm (a bit) more humble, slower to be critical of weakness in others (unless it is poor customer service), and hopefully a better encourager. Maybe I’m even more Christlike!   But we didn’t move here for the lifestyle. We live overseas because of our conviction that Jesus didn't lie when he claimed to be "the way, the truth, and the life" and that "no one comes to the Father except through me." There are so many people who haven't even heard his name yet, let alone have had a chance to decide to follow him. It's not very popular in these pluralistic days to be so "narrow minded," but the Bible is pretty clear on God's jealousy about being the only God, and Jesus' claims to offer eternal salvation only through his sacrifice on the cross.    I'm glad to live in a generation where missions and missionaries are compelled by the truth but full of grace. There's a lot more intentionality about loving people, serving people, blessing people, and along the way sharing our convictions and letting the Holy Spirit convince people. Our calling here is to enable the local Christians. Empower them. Our success comes from seeing them fruitful as witnesses and missionaries. So that's the motivation for leaving the comforts of US. We found Singapore to be a place where both Jim and I could use our unique strengths (his in leadership development and mine in theatre) to be part of God's kingdom work in this world. Just a couple of little specialized cogs in the work He's doing around the globe.   Let me know when you’re coming!

      I loved reading your letter and it is so refreshing to hear someone say they love their live! You are one who has heard the applause of heaven, and chosen joy instead of grumbling! YEAH! I'm reading a book by Max Lucado right now with that title, THE APPLAUSE OF HEAVEN. It's great to think that God is our cheerleader he loves us so much!   My boys are 9 and 5. Tyler finally came after we'd been married 8 years and has his dad's head for math and his mom's artistic temperament. We didn't want to go through the what-ifs of infertility again, so we adopted Cameron, who is practically perfect except that he is so tactile & sensual, we'll have to lock him up at puberty and arrange an immediate marriage! Both boys are bilingual...we all now speak Chinese!   That is something that until 1996 I had never even considerred and I'm still kind of trying to figure out what my place is in this Chinese world. I do have this deep sense of conviction that there is a reason, so I persevere at a bit of language study to keep up with Tyler and review the easier words with Cameron. It is NOT EASY to learn Chinese!!! Singapore's national language is English, but all children take "Mother Tongue" in school, and for Singaporeans this is either Mandarin Chinese, Malay, or Tamil (an indian language). They take school pretty serious here, and we are the only caucasian foreign family I know who has children in the local schools taking Mother Tongue (virtually all Americans put their children in the American School, or homeschool). We work pretty hard at not putting too much pressure on the kids and having fun, and it is working for now. It helps that both boys are NOT shy, and have a healthy self-confidence (Ty's is a bit TOO healthy).   There's a lot of aspects of living overseas that are fabulous, and others no so great (biggest being missing family & friends, missing convenience, familiarity, and the terrible heat and humidity here!). My husband Jim and I felt that our lives had been pretty cushy and we needed the stretch of living overseas to deepen us through some hardship (imagine, wishing hardship on oneself!). We still have a lot of growing to do, as we have seen sides of ourselves come out in the pressure that we didn't know were there!   But the main reason we live overseas is because of our conviction that Jesus was who he claimed to be, and he didn't lie when he claimed to be "the way, the truth, and the life" and that "no one comes to the Father except through me." In college I became really convicted about Jesus' last words to "go into all the world and make disciples." The last words of anyone are pretty important to pay attention to -- and these were the last words of a man who had just proved by resurrection that he was the incarnation of the living God! There are so many people who haven't even heard his name yet, let alone have had a chance to decide to follow him or not. It's not very popular in these pluralistic days to be so "narrow minded," but the Bible is pretty clear on God's jealousy about being the only God, and Jesus' claims to offer eternal salvation through his sacrifice on the cross.    I'm glad to live in a generation where missions and missionaries are more grace-full and we don't go around beating people over the head with our Bibles. There's a lot more intentionality about loving people, serving people, blessing people, and along the way sharing our convictions about Truth. So that's the motivation for leaving the comforts of US. We found Singapore to be a place where both Jim and I could use our unique strengths (his in leadership devleopment and mine in theatre) to be part of God's kingdom work in this world. Just a couple of little specialized cogs in the work He's doing around the globe.    And it is amazing to live by faith...individuals financially support us as God leads them to "partner" with us...that still blows me away (even though it probably shouldn't - we have always supported other missionaries and still do - it's just kind of suprising when you're on the receiving end!). We've been taken care of financially thus far, and have had the money to live like the average Singaporean, make visits to the USA every 18 months, and go back to China on school holidays every year and a half too, AND HERE'S THE BEST PART: like many Singaporeans: we have a live in domestic helper! That's the GREATEST perk of living here! Someone else does my laundry, ironing, and dishes and house work. Isn't that strange? We live in what looks like a clean inner city ghetto - a high-rise concrete building -- in a grove of otehr high-rises -- but all the professionals who live around here, without extended family living with them, all have foreign maids! Very strange! We were without this kind of help the first 9 months here, and without a car, and honestly my life felt like a prison sentence in hell (it is very hot here and the apartment isn't airconditioned). God did a lot of stretching for me that first year (as in "my identity is NOT in what I accomplish for him, but who I am in him") but I am so glad that we have a helper now so that I can have the liberty to do something besides hang the laundry out to dry (and get mildewed in the humid weather!).   So, I get out and do some coaching, performing, writing, teaching in using drama as part of worship, outreach etc. I won't go into it all, but I'll copy a short monologue I'm helping a woman work on this week. I wrote it for an Easter pageant the year Tyler was born.   OK. Enough from me this morning!   It was great to hear from and about you. Send me your address sometime.   Blessings and continued GREAT joy,   K!Mberly

      About a care package, We may live in the suburbs with the "heartlanders"(old Chinese immigrants) of Singapore, but we have discovered some of the more cosmopolitan stores downtown that cater to the ex-pats.   I found JASON'S a few weeks ago while waiting for Jim downtown. This oasis had handmade tortellinis, ESCARGOT and pate to name a couple of the things I was suprised by (and would never buy!)!   We've even found a Tony Roma's. So, I don't think we've any shortage. We have become quite used to the foods here too (in fact, my boys would rather have instant Chinese noodles over PB&J for lunch!). Over the last 5 years, we find we don't crave old favourites (guess we're not as homesick as we were!). AND there's no way you can send fresh donuts...so we'll just have to satisfy THOSE cravings when we're in the states!!!   (from an email to Jill Kaminski)

      Jim and I talked last night about the possibility of moving back to China in a few years...I told him my pre-requisite was that both of us take a course in general handyman stuff or we'd end up divorced in China. Stuff breaks ALL THE TIME there and neither of us can do much more than put in a lightbulb (and sometimes have trouble with that!!). We'll see how the climate for the ministry we can do opens up there. I could forseeably continue networking and writing over the internet from anywhere. Can you imagine how suprised people will be when they order a script (rarely happens, but) and I write back and tell them to mail the check to CHINA?  Funny thought.   RE: When Feeling Ignored, Assume the Best of Others  I have decided that every time I feel slighted I'm going to assume it was an error, or unintended. And when I approach people about it, it always turns out that this is true.  I almost missed out on making one of my best friends in Singapore by not following up on one thing that she'd not responded on which felt like a real "in your face" kind of rejection. However, it turned out she'd overlooked it, and felt terribly.  I'm enjoying reading THE APPLAUSE OF HEAVEN right now, among other things. I need to go over the DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF little book too. Finally feeling like I've a healthy rhythm to life with a car, a dog, the kids happy, and being in a play that rehearses in the mornings - which is affording me an opportunity to really get to know some people. I'm starting to feel like myself again.  (from and email to Dave Calkins)

      We had a great time in KM this December. We still really miss China, and for us it is even more refreshing to visit China than the states (no feelings of obligation in China - just the joy of seeing people we care about and seeing who else we'll meet while there). It was a perfect trip even with the TIC's we encountered daily (stories from China are SO much more interesting than here!)   But we still feel we're best used for the kingdom here (though we're learning to break our Americaness that it's all about personal fulfillment and more about joy in obedience!). I am beginning to thrive...though it's been a rough road.    I've done some workshops and a small bit of writing and performing. I have a small network of professionals I meet with to plan ways to network the believers here for developing and mutual growth. I feel really confident that after 2 years, in our different arenas, Jim and I have met the "who's who" and He has given us great favour with the influential people.   This week is big. Our organization is being established as a SIngaporean mentoring society, and the board meets for the first time this week - April 3rd at lunch. I feel amazed at the dream team who's coming on the board. Definitely from Him. If I talk about this with my drama friends, it really starts to sound like "name dropping," the names are so well known and respected in the Singaporean C circles, so I have stopped, unless they press me!   I begin rehearsals this week for the first major production I've committed to. A local club is putting $30,000 a production into a children's community theatre and has hired a gifted guy to produce them. Since it's a professional show they rehearse during the days and the boys will be in school, so I agreed to attend rehearsals and understudy (and mentor). We feel it's a great way to get me out of the house, challenged, and to get to know the director (whom I greatly admire). The cast who are mostly younger Singaporeans making a go at professional theatre and also know - to some degree- our friend.    So, I'm excited and a bit nervous. It will take some juggling, and we have a new helper whos still got a lot of training to do to feel confident. After 5 years of learning to live with feeling inefficient, and unproductive, or that my role is administration and wrestling with computer problems, and then the big lesson that came with it: how my identity is in who my Dad is and not what I do...which I'm not sure I've learned! I feel a little rusty about "getting out there." The producer wants me to direct in September, but we haven't found a suitable show yet (I just read a new musical version by Judith Viorst of Alexander and the Terrible, etc, it was good!), but the thought is pretty frightening at this point, though I imagine once I feel back in the swing of things, I'll be gung ho!   Kids are great. Cam just got over chicken pox, and is a charmer. Tyler is the class monitor, still doing Chinese, and has been doing work for commercials for local TV (English!). Both are sp. sensitive and Easter really touched them at different points during the week of talking about it and watching videos...so that's the most important thing!

       I've had a great day.  Even though my new video player has joined the ranks of our many Asian appliances that don't live much past their warranty, our mailbox today had not one but two packages from Yorba Linda containing WEST WING my favourite show...on video. YEAH!    I've had a great day.  Even though part of my day included a cursory perusal through the pile which has accumulated on my desk (and the floor around my desk), I'm happy and busy with "Rainbow Fish" rehearsals.   BUT My efforts have unearthed the following urgent items:    the application for a dog license,    a notice that our foreign worker levy was not automatically deducted from our bank account in April and at the point of the notice, they hadn't received my check (another fallout from the delay with SCEM!),    a notice of a warrant for arrest of the owner of this apartment (I made a call which, though automated, revealed that the arrest was coming from a summons from the Broadcast Authority - an entity we didn't know until this year needed to be paid annually for the license to have a radio or TV in your home),    the accident report for our run in with the motorcylist May 1st (insurance said to file the report at the car repair, the car repair has told me to first file the form with my insurance company),    the rental agreement signed in January that needs to be taken to some office called the Inland Revenue Authority for some kind of official "stamping,"    and the notification forms for Tyler's change of school that needs to be filed at Immigration (I've been there twice, the first time alone, in December, I found out he needed to be with me for a picture and he'd already gone with Jim ahead of me to China for the holiday, the second time was the day I had the car full of kids was in a rush to get one of them back for an appointment and spent my time at the Immigration building in the parking lot exchanging particulars with the driver of the car I hit while trying to park).     I'll get to it tomorrow.      It was a great day.  Even though I took my car in to Honda for the routine 60,000 mile check up yesterday morning and I still don't have it back...(you know standard check: check the tires, change the oil and transmission fluid, check the underside for rust, give it a good waxing and vacuum, and make sure the engine is running properly?) By 5:30PM today they finally returned my calls to say it was ready ($717 total bill - good thing I told them to skip conditioning the upholstery), but I'd have to get to the shop 1/2 hour away within the next hour, and at the time I had a guest over for dinner. I'll go pick it up on my good day tomorrow.    I had a great day because  the kids and I took Rascal for a long walk just after breakfast. And even though this intended aerobic walk for cardivascular fitness didn't get my heart rate above 100, even though Cameron pooped out and we sent him up the elevator early, and even though Tyler got smacked in the mouth from walking behind me while I was swinging my arms (trying to get my pulse rate up SOMEHOW). Even though they won't let dogs on the track at the stadium, and I was resorting to calling my sons derogatory names like, "You coupl'a LADIES!" to try to get them to pick up their pace, I finally gave in. Tyler and I ended up just strolling through the park hand in hand enjoying the morning and the fact that he's already 9 and still likes holding my hand, and I've adjusted to the tropics enough that it didn't feel scorching hot, yet.    I had a great day because  I find that the boys actually like study time when I'm around. Tyler did 45 minutes of a Chinese revision computer game while Cameron watched. Tyler read and reported from his WHAT YOUR 3rd GRADER NEEDS TO KNOW book (he learned about quilting), and both he and Cameron practiced their penmanship. Tyler told me last week he thought it was impossible for his writing to improve. I told him his writing was bad because I had not forced him to tediously practice his penmanship perfectly when he was in kindergarten (for which he then said, "And I thank you for that!"). So, after I gave him the "PERFECT practice makes perfect" speech, we made an agreement for this first week of the holiday: We're devoting 7 days to building the strength and coordination in their large AND small muscle groups, so along with the morning brisk walks (drags), they've agreed to submitting to daily practicing their penmanship to see if their writing improves. I hope I'm right in guaranteeing that it will.    I had a great day because  I finally had an opportunity to treat my Australian neighbor to the pedicure I'd promised for her birthday present...Loonni watched all the kids in the afternoon while Jackie and I had an hour and a half being pampered at the nail shop in the Mall (our Tampines Mall has one of the only 6 nail places I could find in the phone book).     I had a great day because  I had a chance to slip into Starbucks for about the 3rd time all year and treat myself to a frappucino WITH whipped cream.    I had a great day because  the infamously busy dramatist and Faith Lew came all the way out to our suburbian condo to brainstorm with me ideas of what she can to teach Chinese 9&10 year olds in a drama camp in a Yunnan village next week. I taught her the ideas for teaching English that Tyler and I had used in his kindergarten class in Kunming and she was excited about these ideas for breaking up her standard drama teaching in Mandarin with some fun ways to get kids comprehending English (and it will really impress the regular teacher and parents!). We had a simple meal of some Chicken alphabet soup I'd thrown together and gave Faith our homemade flour tortillas to try for the first time (she loved the Pace salsa almost as much as she liked all the stuff we have hanging on our walls and setting about the house), and then we sent her on her way to her next rehearsal.    I had a great day because  after dribbling and shooting practice (in the house on the tiles and against the wall) with our playground rubber ball, I can see marked improvement in the boys only after 3 days. To celebrate, Tyler turns on the electric keyboard to an automatic song, crank it up to the fastest it will play and do some crazy dancing until we're all sweaty and ready for bed.    I had a great day because  when we stopped what we were doing because we heard a man's voice (a neighbor) yelling and carrying on angrily, I asked Tyler if my hollering ever sounds like that; and his eyes got really big and he said, "No." I told him that when I hear someone yelling like that I always like to take a minute to pray for the person who's being yelled at, and then for the person doing the yelling, that they will somehow find peace and patience in God's love and through his power.    I had a great day because  we turned on the bedroom airconditioner and read more from Corrie Ten Boom's THE HIDING PLACE, and I get to be the first one who enlightens the boys to this kind of Godly courage, and give them their first exposure to that awful war, by means of the people who emerged from the horrors with their strong faith and convictions in tact. We finished the chapter, Cameron had fallen asleep, and Tyler spontaneously threw his arms around me and said, "I love you mom."    I had a great day because  I didn't clean a single dish, mop any floors, scrub one toilet, wash or iron one item of clothing, I didn't even make my bed; and yet my house looks almost spotless when I turn the lock on the front door and turn off the living room lights at bedtime. I was teaching Loonni how to cook something and I joked about my being a bad wife because my cookbooks are still so "new" after 16 years of marriage, Loonni told me in her broken Chinese, "Oh, boss-lady, that is not true! You are a good wife! Wahh, I've never met anyone who can do so many things as you!" (when I told Jim this later, he joked, "Yes, and in her 28 years she's met SO VERY MANY people in her village and factory-work experience!" The rat!)    I had a great day because  Tyler's last words when the lights were turned out were, "Thank you God for giving me such a neat home." I look around in the dark at their clearly cluttered small room, shut the door of his room and put away a few of the kids books still lying around on the floor by the bookshelf in the hall. This IS a fun house, even though it's just an apartment, even though they have so much homework, even though there's no carpet to wrestle on. There's something interesting to look at, play with, or learn about everywhere you turn. And there's heaps and heaps of love here too.

      I want to tell you something about how God prompted you to write me your sweet note on "HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY." He has used it in a special way. I think that you'd be blessed by the reminder of how God is working in and through us, and orchestrating the events of our lives and making all things beautiful in his time.  It's a holiday I am particularly NOT fond of because of our years of childlessness. For awhile, before Tyler came, I actually stopped going to church on this particular weekend. Even now I am always so tenderhearted toward the singles who yearn to be married mothers, or single moms who don't have a husband to rally the kids to worship her for the day, and infertle couples who face the unknown of whether God will give them the desires of their hearts. Worshipping on Mothers day is a weekend I'd just as soon skip...and all that hoo haw of the gift giving and recognition!   My MOST painful VIVID memory I recall everytime I even THINK of mother's day. It is something that happened on a mother's day when I was visiting your Sunday School Class years ago before God chose to give us Tyler and Cameron. They were passing the box of corsages, and doing the fussing over the women, and the box went past me without my even touching it. The woman next to me made a flippant comment. She meant it lightheartedly, "Well not for YOU! ....Maybe someday!" but I, in a state of hopelessness felt like I'd been kicked in the stomach and wanted to say, "Maybe Never!"  Here's another MAYBE: Maybe, after your sweet timely email, God can help me not to replay that scene next year, and be able to enjoy the ceremonies of the day!  Dear woman, thank you a million times for your support, care and encouraging words over the years. You are a JEWEL! And thinking about you always makes me smile!  Kimberly

      I saw HONK! yesterday afternoon with Lucilla. It's a sweet wonderful new musical about the Ugly Duckling.   Everyone else in the family quacked, and he HONKED!   Wish you could've seen it with me. We would've wept together! Because of having just talked to you the night before, I was especillay tender toward the mother - she really loved her baby and even though she diddn't really "get" him, she stood up for him to others and went searching for him when he was missing.    Your call meant alot to me.   And then this recurring song "DIFFERENT." The lyrics touched me on many levels...Lucilla sitting next to me, single and an artist in singapore (who's parents are both deceased), my always having been the odd one in our family, Tyler's being the only caucasion in his school and his being forced to study Chinese, and Cameron's having been adopted and the issues he'll have being brown. People are forever asking "Why he so dark what?" You'll have to see it when it comes around, or pick up the album. It's the kind of show we'd have done at RHCC for dessert theatre - a great message and uplifting! So different than the rest of what's coming across the secular stage these days.   Anyway, Happy Mother's Day. I love you so much, and miss you terribly.   Kimberly

      from email with Elaine Bent, Texas    E: You all are on my prayer list, and I pray for you every day.  I pray all will continue to be successful and that the bumps in the road will be smoothed out by God.     K: Thank you! This past week was REALLY full of difficult things that I won't go into, and it was a WONDERFUL week of joy and strength. I'm sure because of people praying after I'd send that last email.    E: I finally found out where Singapore is! Malaysia.  You are quite a fer piece from China, Lady.  I remember hearing about Singapore during W.W.II.  And I knew it was Asian. That is all I knew about it. Oh, yes. The Japanese invaded it, too.  I assume that in Singapore you are not under threats to be a missionary like you were in China.  Since China is so much against missionaries, how do you go to China to teach and not be at risk?  I have read about their treatment of missionaries, and you told me how careful you all had to be while you were there. My ignorance makes me afraid for you when you go there.  I believe God will be with you, but I guess I am just a coward.      K: Philippians 4:13! Jim just got back last night from being in China - a 10 day trip. Meeting up with leaders of various ministries and denominations there. There are dangers, but there's a real excitement about what God is doing , and the thrill of the sensation of being on the Front Lines rather than in a more supporting role here in Singapore.   Singapore is a city nation - an island -- which has been independently governed for 35 years (used to be under Birtish Rule, and then part of Malaysia), now neighboring countries are really jealous because of Singapore's proseperity and modernity. It's a pretty sophisticated place, an oasis of civiliation in the middle of so many developing countries. Of course, we think it still has a ways to go in their civilizing (as you've read in my many emails!), but it is a remarkable little country about the size and population of say, Houston. They even have their own media - magazines, news, TV shows, movie "industry," Singaporean "stars." For such a little place, they are really into being recognized on the world scene! Kind of a "small man complex" we've got the world's best zoo, airport, largest hotel, largest fountain, even just got in the guiness book of world records for having had the largest line dancing party! Last year a church's community services did a fund raiser and made it in the book for largest tea party (6000).     E: Your boys sound like they have adapted themselves very well to their new situation. I know you are very proud of them.  And a puppy!  How they must love that!!     K: Our little puppy has brought joy to the boys, but I love that little creature too! Besides Paul, the other woman who is working with me to offer training to church drama teams has two girl kitties at home; her babies. I now really know I'm her friend - she just asked me last night to feed them while she's on vacation (Good thing I have a car! It's still a 20 minute drive, but it is easier for me to do it with wheels than asking someone who'd have to walk or take a bus to her house!)

      From and email to Tambra Murphy a college friend...  I think we ALL ought to do more praying for each other, me included, cultivate that attentive mind & heart to the Holy Spirit's promptings to pray for one another. I don't really understand prayer much, and don't have a "gift" of intercession, but I know some do, and this week I've felt this kind of spiritual weakness. Star Warish kind of weakening of the Force.  Over the years I have always been frustrated by missionaries who through the way they communicate seem to think that they are the only ones doing "God's work." I have strong convictions that committed bankers, or real estate agents, teachers, or grocery clerks, or anyone who "has been crucified with Christ" letting Christ live in and through them, brings him glory, and influences others for Truth as much (and sometimes more) than a Bible translator or church planter who's packed it up and gone "to the ends of the earth." Every believer hears God's call on their life, and every calling is different vocationally, but there is no difference in our calling to be wholly his whatever we are doing!  Blessings & Joy, Kimberly

      I need to persevere in prayer!    We need to keep asking others for prayer as well! This week I've had an especially strong sense of this.  That realization of our need for Divine protection, and how the prayers of others give us some kind of stronger "covering" or protection.   Surely every believer is dependent on God and need the prayers of others; but being in vocational cross cultural ministry, I think we are especially targeted by the Enemy. He's not happy about our life choices, our wholehearted submission to Christ, or that God is blessing our efforts.   I know I'm preaching to the choir, but it's not enough to be abiding in Christ, and develop spiritual disciplines, and on our own be asking for his power and protection. We need each other!   Perhaps I've sensed this recently because we've been reporting to our supporters how great things are going this year. Maybe they've relaxed in their intercession for us, thinking, "Thank you God that you've brought them through those hard times of adjustment..." We've convinced them that we're not suffering in Singapore, God is blessing the work and "enlarging our territory," and yet...   Yesterday afternoon, we attended a disheartening time meeting the Tampines Cell Group from our church (the first meal with anyone from our church after attending for 10 months). I spent the time at this lunch constantly asking God to give me his love for the other people in the room. In my flesh I was tired of initiating in conversations and meeting for the x-thousandth time timid-yet-proud people; feeling like an alien under slilent scrutiny, bored, critical; and even angry with the other children. They were deliberately ignoring Tyler and Cameron. One boy Tyler's age rebuffed every effort Ty made to initate conversation or play (at one point, all the children got up and walked out of the room when Tyler asked them what they wanted to do). I know this sounds pitiful, but I spent part of the afternoon hiding out in the kitchen/laundry room, wondering how Jim could be so great at mingling, while watching the rain fall out the 11th storey window and holding back the tears. Me. The extrovert. Not anymore.   Jim drove us back to Tampines in order to see a matinee of Spiderman (which we loved and I'm sure was written by Christians), and before parking, we were in another car accident (the 3rd one in less than 2 years, and the second one in the car we purchased 6 months ago). As I opened my door to get out at the curb, two people on a motorcyle were trying to whiz past in the small amount of space between our car and the curb! They ran into the edge of my door, seconds away from hitting me (or Cameron, if he had "hopped out" right when I asked him to). I was so panicked that the motorcyclist was injured, not thinking first of fault, just sick at the thought of how in an instant life can change. I found myself thinking, "And I haven't even made it in to report the last accident yet, let alone paid the attorney $1500 for the damages to the other parties car." "Wasn't I just yesterday telling Jim how scared I am driving with all the motorcyclists zipping around on these roads?"    And then I was suprised by the overwhelming compulsion in my heart:     "I CAN’T TAKE IT ANYMORE!! I just want to GO BACK TO AMERICA where these kinds of things don't happen with such regularity!!!"    The young man must have thought it was his fault because his knee was obviously in pain, his bike had some damage, and our car obviously will need repair but he didn't want to file a report, or go to the hospital, or even give us his name. We called the police and they just told us to report it to our insurance. The Honda repair guy and I are already on a first name basis after being in for repairs for wrecks and other kinds of freak damage 3 times in 5 months already, so boy is he going to be suprised to see me again.    The enemy was at me yesterday in obvious ways: Rehearsing in my mind what seems like an extraordinarily unusual amount of accidents, mishaps, stolen bikes (and stolen other things...), broken appliances (etc.), sicknesses (that we can't seem to get over), even just a spirit of clumsiness: daily spilling and dropping and breaking things at home... How easy it is to entertain what feels like a justifiable pity party!    But I listened this time to the Holy Spirit and chose to honour God by thanking him, remembering a thankful heart can help us be resistant to discouragement, negative thinking,and cynicism. I realized in amazement how God protected us. How close we came to getting hit by that bike. I was reaching for the handle of the car door to get out 3 seconds before, and decided to turn back to the kids to say something first...    How very thankful I am for that obvious act of protection, and all the other times he protects us unknowingly.    How thankful that so far, inattentiveness or clumsiness results only in breaking a small thing like a new vase before it's out of the wrapping from IKEA, and not a broken back, or worse. The enemy wants me to be fearful, seeing danger everywhere (a new sensation for me), when God wants me to find courage through him, and trust in his protection. And he wants us to thankfully recognize his sovereignty in all things so that when he allows pain, we know it is only his divine joy that will give us strength and joy to not be defeated.   Amen?   Fondly,   Kimberly

      So, after my spontaneously invited dinner guests left, and the kids - with one friend over to spend the night - finally fell asleep; after Loonni came home at 10 from her first experience meeting Thai Christians and attending a worship service (Last week we gave her some Thai tracts and a gospel of John, This week I found a Thai church, and took her there this afternoon). She came home to tell me she's given her heart to Jesus and can't sleep she's so excited. Cameron came out for a drink of water and I told him to ask her...   So he says in Chinese, "Loonni? You love Jesus now?"    She touches her heart, "YES! I do!"   He turns to pour the water and says in Chinese. "That's good. But not as much as me. I love him the MOST!"

       To Grammy Lynn:    A few weeks ago he was desperate for a certain toy that was more than he wanted to spend of his own money, and more than we'd pay just for the fun of it. You know how Tyler gets OBSESSED about wanting stuff. And he'd just come back from getting some goodies from the Coventons the week before.  The thought crossed my mind that if you were around you'd be driving him to Toys R Us the next day and buying both he AND Cameron one! I even thought of calling you, and then a day or two later I realized that it was only days until Tyler's half birthday...what a great excuse to spoil him! I suggested we'd pay 1/2...he thought that was agood idea but ended up we settled on him paying about $10 US. We even had a cake! Took some pictures. Made it a family DATE NIGHT. Cameron even got the dreamed of little star wars action figure he'd been dreaming of.  But the deal is, that neither of them can use the word "WANT" with us, or with the grandparents, about any toy until November (when it's time to write a Christmas list). If they find there is something they begin to want they have to write it down and save it until November!  SO, all that said, both boys would be tickled at any small amount of cash you'd want to "reward" them with. With Cameron not getting allowance yet, and the toys they like being the same, I'd say make it the same amount.  Cameron is tackling some pretty hard Chinese (he writes quite a few, and reads more than 75 words - more than Tyler had to at this age because Tyler was oldest in his classes and Cameron is the youngest so he's more stretched, and not the top student like his brother. In fact, the way Cameron sees it, he's just glad he's not THE worst in class!). He will soon finish his 100 reading lessons, and knows he will get a bike for that!

      Virtually all the Christian ministry expats send their children to the  International Community School . We do spend a lot of effort connecting with "referrals;" friends of friends who are here only a short while. I must say, it is easier to make these connections with a car. I found myself questioning whether I wanted to spend $35+ on taxi fair to just go meet up with someone I'll never see or hear from again since most of these connections never turn into real friendships. These connections rarely come to much more than another name in the address list. Guess it's the nature of being an ex-pat. So many people are transient and you treat most of your relationships like a cocktail party. Jim doesn't seem to mind it, but for the kids and I it's gotten really old.   I have had a once a month prayer group with Kim Burchell and a few other American women - that has been great. And occassionally we see the Griffiths- the family who did the baseball league last year, as well as this new Australian family across the street. We see them a couple times a week now!   urlLink    August 2002 National Day celebrations in the park across the street.  Thanks to the dog  Rascal , who needs a walk in the park 2 times a day, we're starting to recognize familar faces of people in our broader neighborhood who are also out exercising regularly. I've made a decision to look as many in the eye as I can make eye contact with and say, "Good morning" in English or Chinese. Try and get them to smile back. It usually works. And now, a few familiar faces light up and initiate a greeting when they see us!  I was just visiting last night with my artist friend from England. She's caucasian I met here in Tampines early on while I was grocery shopping. She's a bit rough around the edges and I'm always very bold about where my opinions about how we live come from (the Bible and a faith in Jesus). It's nice to have someone here who initiates with me. Her children are grown and she just married her Muslim Singaporean boyfriend who is 15 years younger than she is! She's been here 12 years and has a really bad attitude about the gossipy unfriendly locals, so I was lecturing her: "You can't let them get to you, you must "get to them." Go overboard in being nice and friendly. There's no way these people will ever change unless someone shows them a different way to treat people!"  I've had 2 calls in the past week about acting opprotunities for Tyler and I. One a TV production company that does children's shows and another one that produces short shows that are shown in hospital waiting rooms - Health TV. Supposed to be shows with local humor about hospitals...lighten up the atmosphere. The producers are thrilled that Tyler can speak Chinese and are thinking up ways to use him.

      What a Godward organization we've joined! I am always amazed when I get to know others with CRM. Very humbling to have fellowship with and be a part of such a gifted, saintly group of peers!   The speaker was captivating - John Piper - inspiring and pointed us to passion in worshipping God as the ONLY thing that will give us satisfaction in this vapour we call our life; and how He doesn't need us; and a fresh perspective on serving him from our weakenss (sessions were refreshing and thought provoking - and convicting as well!). I was really honoured and a little stressed when the CRM president asked me ahead of time to coordinate 4 dramas to set up these teaching times for such a preacher (I've read 2 of his books this year - A Hunger for God and Desiring God . If you haven't read them...add them to your list!)...I only had a little more than a week ahead of time with notes he'd emailed on what he'd preach about, and didn't have a clue who my "talent pool" was. But it was entirely Divine how it all came together flawlessly and beautifully with just the right people for every piece.   Like Eric Liddell (Chariots of Fire), I sensed God's pleasure in the process of doing what I love to do, and the execution of it too. I know that He was guiding and inspiring in the preparations for it. It was a gift to me to be asked, when no one in the organization has ever seen my work - AND so very personally rewarding for me since I love integrating the theatrical in worship, know how to, and I really haven't had an opportunity for the 5 years I've been gone from California. I know more times will come in the future, but this opportunity was very special.   Remember the old hymn FOLLOW ME?  "I travelled down a weary road and no one seemed to care. The burden on my weary back had bowed me with despair...."  Wow. Many at the conference got sick from the food, or the water, and I wasn't spared. The last morning when I was set to sing this hymn dressed as a pilgrim...set up as starting from a seat in the house and walking down an aisle to the stage in front, across and out a side stage door at the end of the song... I was so sick, dizzy and weak, that when an extrememly gifted violinist started her Applalachian style accompaniment, I didn't know if I would stay standing when it came time for me to get up and sing. Jim told me later he had never heard me sound better. I felt so much power in my voice. When I got to the last verse and was kneeling on the stage belting out,  "These are the words I hear him speak to me: If just a cup of water, I place within your hands, then just a cup of water is all that I demand, so if by death to living they can thy glory see, I'll lift my cross and follow close to thee..."    No one needed to tell me later that God spoke to them in that song. His presence was evident. What a tangible application to the lessons God is teaching me!

I want Breath That won't be wasted  On complaints or criticism.  I want Breath That will waft a blessing On those few other vapours Who are sharing these seconds with me.  I want my         Puuhhhffffff To raise a delighted eyebrow Not wrinkle up a nose.  Oh God! Fill my cup with  That sweet fragrance of Christ.  His vapour was even shorter than most. Yet, For the joy set  Before him, Endured the CROSS.  No complaints.         Puuhhhffffff. His vapour on earth Now long gone. Ascended.  But his fragrance  Remains. Spread by my joy. By your joy. In the seconds we have left.  "But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him. For we are to God the aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing."  II Corinthians 2:14,15

       urlLink    July 2002: Our "Great Marriages" cell group celebrates the 4th of July with us.  Happy 4th of July!   I'm having a love/hate day with Singapore today.    Had a beautiful time last night with 3 Singaporean couples, our closest friends here, to celebrate our 4th -- they were all very game and festive. I told them all when they greeted me they had to say, "God bless America!" Since it was the first 4th of July since 9/11, which, as I've written about before made me terribly homesick, and which was why I was feeling extrememly patriotic. Loads of red/white/and blue, a BBQ, we all sang the National Anthem and God Bless America etc.. Pretty fun.   Then we got home at 10:15PM to our little suburb of highrises, parked our car in a loading area, and in the 4 minutes while we were taking the sleeping Creasmans up from the car, some good-for-nothing-that-God-loves-as-much-as-me walked by and stole 2 bags we'd set by the car - containing Jim's work clothes & shoes, house keys, his cellphone, a couple of treasured coffeetable books about America (one new one from my mom on the heros of 9/11), and a silly pair of size 11 wooden shoes (Cameron's souvenier from our layover in Holland last week). I immediately took the dog for a walk -- partly to blow off steam, partly seaching for the offending terrorist (well, ok, "petty theif") so I could get back my stuff (I was confident that I am bigger than whoever it was that took it), and partly asking God to give me a heart that wants to pray for this person and all the people who live by the "finders-keepers" rule in life.  I know it's just stuff, but it makes me SO mad sometimes. We've had more than enough of this kind of petty theft in a nation that's known for it's low crime rate. We have an unseen Enemy who doesn't want us to like it here!

      I was hit by a speeding motorcyclist yesterday - with his girlfriend on the back. Malay muslim kids. The way they flew and rolled in front of my car I thought they'd for sure be dead, but after hainging around at the site for all the police reports we went to find them at the hospital...only abrasions. I shared merely that God loves them and surely has a plan for keeping them alive, and that the instant of the crash, I prayed for their protection as I saw them rolling. It is illegal to share "Christ" with Muslims in Singapore, but I have heard stories of conversions when Jesus appears to people in dreams...so as they are in the hospital and recovering, pray that Jesus introduce himself as the one who saved them...twice. Once yesterday and once 2 thousand years ago.   I'm a bit shook up too. This is the 3rd auto accident in owning our car for 9 months (and cars are about 4xs the price here), I've had a robbery (the 4th of July), been served for a law suit (the 10th), a parking ticket when I was not parking illegally (last week), and had a man practice a lewd act on me while studying in the library the day before yesterday...then the accident yesterday where I was sure for an instant that my car had caused 2 people to die...hmmm. With our influence growing in the circles we've come to serve, it just makes me convinced that we're making the enemy angry...and with this encouragement and God's grace, I can keep my head on straight during the day. But last night I had trouble sleeping...

      What hurt so badly those days was that in the FIRST week of September 2001 I'd had neighbors and their children in my home making lanterns for lantern festival, and having tea, and getting a group together to go swimming. Then 2 days later, nothing but the twin towers collapsing was in the news and I felt like we were invisible in our neighborhood.   EVERYONE in the world was watching it on TV and talking about it for days on end, and watching and reading how the world was reaching out to their American friends around the world in this time of pain...  Everyone in this town knows we're Americans (They also know how much rent we pay, and that our boys speak Chinese, etc.). Yet  NO ONE in Tampines looked at or spoke to me, for a week! On a National scale, when something was put together publically to memorialize those who died (held at National Stadium), it was the American Association who organized it. The Singaporeans did not know how to or didn't value responding with compassion.  At first, because of how painful it was personally, I was angry. Almost hateful. We were so pitifully needy, we all wore t-shirts that said AMERICA to church the following weekend. We wanted people to know we were Americans, hoping someone would speak to us after the service, but no one did. NO ONE! I wanted someone to bake me a casserole, or at least say, "Wow, I'm so sorry about what happened in your country. It's really tragic." But there was just this icky SILENCE.  When people finally said something it was,   "Did you know anyone who died?...NO? Oh, that's good."   (GOOD???)  or   "I'm sorry I didn't say anything, we were all THINKING ABOUT you, I just didn't know what to say."   Over the months, my anger turned to pity, to compassion. I  started looking out my HDB windows to the hundreds of windows within my view, thinking about what kinds of unprocessed pain hides behind these doors. It has grown in me a deeper compassion for the people of Singapore. Going through this painful expereince taught me in a deep way how people are emotionally and socially incabable of handling greif. Mine was deep, but still not entirely personal, or life changing, BUT how much more painful, and "disfunctional" for those who live ALL around us who cannot process the Japanese occupation, or poverty, or loss of a loved one, or abuse, or miscarriage, or infidelity, or retrenchement, or, or, or.... I think I'm much more compassionate for having gone through the post 9/11 experience in a cold country.   To be completely fair:  I'll have you know that two friends did call the day of the tragedy, and when I was talking with dear Nora Neo about a week later, she made me a pie! I am so thankful they did. I think if NO ONE had, I may have given up! I may have forced Jim to take me back to the comforts of home (or Tarshish, like Jonah and run from His clear call to be here).   I believe that in time, we are going to LOVE Singapore, not just from our WILL, but by the grace of God with ALL our HEARTS.

       to a friend we've been meeting with bi-weekly   You've done SO MUCH to help Jen and Lawrence in their whirlwind of getting to China, and setting up their life there... Come to think of it, seems like you help everyone you know! I can't help but thank God for you everyday when I look around my home at all the beautiful things you gave or loaned to help us settle. I imagine that all the work, and leading, and helping you do is exhausting. Not to mention that you've pushed on after the emotionally and spiritually draining & disappointing stuff with the staff couple you had to let go last year (and probably heaps of other interpersonal issues I don't know about). You are often in my thoughts and then prayers about juggling your competing demands.    We'll need to pow wow about what to do with our GREAT MARRIAGES cell group since Lawrence and Jen are gone. Important to talk aboutyour thoughts, as well as Cheng and Craig's needs. Bless them, they said a while back, this is the first time in their Christian lives that they've actually looked forward to going to cell... I have loved seeing Craig warm up to you two. When they were dating, they had a bunch of negative comments from 'friends' at church about their hopes of staying together. He's such a new Christian and has so much to learn...and yet has a lot of pride covering up his lack of spiritual maturity. I know that he has never had an older male Christian friend. You and Cheng are my dearest Singaporean sisters in Christ, so it has been an indulgent joy for me that you have gotten to know her a little.   Here's where we're coming from: As we started this group, our thoughts/needs were, first deepening friendships in a context of our common faith and being married. Starting with a low-key (not lots of reading or homework), pretty safe subject that will help us gel as a group -- build trust, history, memories, and an ability to get below the surface with one another.    Jim and I are at a place in our marriage where processing our "timeline," "purpose statement" or thinking about the future are helping us get reaquainted and better understand each other. We guessed that each of us as couples would even learn some things about our mates for the first time. We thought that this might be a good exercise for all of the 4 couples in starting out, before deciding if we want to stay together to tackle a tougher subjects like what it take for each of us to have a great and Godly marriage.    I think I can understand what you listed about what you want in a small group, and I think that your statement that you're not a "people person" makes our felt needs so very different. For Jim and I, it's been a long 5+ years of not having much fellowship with any long term, deep, meaningful, enjoyable and transparent friendships.    In these 5 years, we have been (in different settings) praising, worshiping, praying, and hearing from the word with people who always feel like strangers. The superficiality of hundreds of acquaintances here, added to our long term loss of deep friendships from a lifetime in LA, was  the "method to our madness" in having our GREAT MARRIAGE times together be so relational. I've been growing in my understanding of the practice of the presence of God, so even though we haven't spent great amounts of time dedicated to prayer or worship, our times of joking around the meal have an awareness of the presence of the Lord in our midst. For me, and the way I'm wired, it isn't a matter of "either/or," spiritual, academic or a party, it's less dichotomized...   I get worship, I get times devoted to prayer and I get Bible study on my own...but it's been through our small group, that I finally am feeling that koinonia, that I have local brothers and sisters who I care enough about to be praying for regularly through the week, OR I feel may care about me enough to think of me, and maybe pray for me, past the greet-your-neighbor moment in a worship service. Admittedly, hearing from other friends that they have been in a typical Friday-sing-pray-study small group since coming to Singapore, and they don't feel any real bonds of kinship with their group, has made me desperate that we NOT be like that.    OKAY...enough about this...we can talk when we meet!

      From email to Elaine Bent in Dallas, TX  I've caught up on my sleep and some of the piles in the office...all that home administrivia that got shelved for the back to back run of Rainbow Fish-trip to USA-Little Violet.   Attending parent meetings at school and Cameron's music class at Yamaha last Saturday I had to marvel at the different worlds I was a part of...Back to "normal life" it's hard to imagine that the week before I'd been going through security with my pass to get backstage of the Esplanade, and hanging out with local TV stars...ha!   I've been asked to do a guest appearance in a show/concert in May. Three local actor/singers are doing a variety show and want me to come do a musical theatre number with them - I think the plan is that they'll back me up with accappella, When You Walk Through a Storm from Carousel.   Paul Seow also asked me last week to direct his children's production for May, but after praying about it, said no. I told him if I said YES it would be for all the wrong reasons. So I'll help them out in a smaller capacity, and have my days more free for other things. I've agreed to write for two shows for schools and the scripts need attention.    But most important, I feel that I want to begin being more intentional about discipleship and mentoring some of these younger women I've come to know through these shows. I have been suprised by the way some of the guys have opened up to me about their spirituality too - even the homosexuals in the cast. I am meeting one of them for tea today - so we'll just have to see why God has brought these dear ones into my life too.   Have you read THE SACRED ROMANCE, Drawing Nearer to the Heart of God by John Eldridge and Brent Curtis? Wow, I am LOVING IT. It is playing my heartstrings and speaking to my soul like no Christian book I've read...just what I needed to hear as I've been longing for more passion in my relationship with Christ. Something I read in the book yesterday had me going to bed lst night thinking how much I truly LOVE GOD with feelings and not just my head. Loads of theatre analogies in it too because John was an actor in LA for part of his career...   Well thats enough for now. It was great to get your news about CITA. Do stay in touch. I pray you'll know his joy and favour on your life today.

       from an email to Cyndi Davis   Thank you for your note. We are feeling safe as anyone (and probably more safe than most since we're not worriers and there are no air raids or bombs dropping or orange alerts here!) God is good and still in control even when things seem to be going crazy, and the enemy seems to be having a field day!  Our kids have an extra 10 days of vacation since they shut down schools due to a deadly highly contagious pneumonia that they haven't got a handle on how to treat. A few people have died but there's still a few million of us unaffected! Gives us a chance to catch up since we'd fallen a bit behind in our Chinese studies! We played a great April fools joke on the boys - we called our home phone at 7 am from our cell phone and then went in and told the boys is was their teacher calling to say the epidemic was over early and they had to go to school. We had them get up, get dressed in their school uniform, and walk 1/2 way to school until they could see for themselves there were no other kids on the playground... they got a real kick out of that and laughed all day (Tyler called all his friends to tell them how crazy his parents were!)  Gotta keep your sense of humor....

      from and email to Donna Cole    D: I so appreciated getting your e-mail to know your prayer requests. You said that Jim's work is keeping him in Singapore these days.  Is that why his pace is slower--because he is at home?  Does he travel a lot normally?      K: Part of why it is slower is that we are purposefully taking it slower this year. Jim and I both enjoy working, but we can be on the driven side. We are learning to slow down a bit and take better care of ourselves. We've been through some tough things emotionally since coming to Singapore (which the letter will allude to), and now, with the Burchells leaving, we are working at some healing, growing from the experience, and filling up our reserves. I've even started working out with Jim at the gym 3 times a week! A first for us! I feel great! Carving more time out for reading and growing through the Word, and other books. Journaling and praying more.   Jim traveled A LOT last fall, and had WAY too much to do. It was a season of overload, since different areas he leads all had events in the fall. Sometimes it just happens that way, and it is do-able, but not as a way of life!!!  Since some of his work deals outside Singapore, in helping workers in networking/developing "strategic partnerships" for the Gspl in a big country to the north of us, he travels quite a bit for that. From time to time there are meetings as a CRM director that he travels to be a part of too. He normally takes a couple trips a quarter, somewhere. It is neat living in Singapore too, we are very close to so many Asian countries. As a family we sometimes take trips to nearby countries during our school breaks. This year, I get to do some Christian drama training in Malaysia, and perhaps Cambodia too! Jim will stay home and guard the home front then!    D: The focus here has been so much on the war that I remember hearing of SARS, but I did not realize that it was stopping attendance at schools.  Is that pretty much all around you?  Forgive me.  I don't have a lot of time to watch the news!    K: We all enjoyed the time off, spending more time together, though it will be sad that our summer break, which is usually only 4 weeks, is now cut to 2 weeks! I feel like I got to know the boys better because of having them home all day everyday and their normal playmates weren't being allowed to leave their houses to come over or allow the kids to go to their houses to play (there were 2 exceptions) I'd listened well to the Spirit's leading to say "no" to a couple of things ahead of the SARS outbreak, so I was free to give them my attention!  Kids are back in school as of last week, but there is a lot of control and news and fear. Filling out forms nearly everyday stating whether we've been in SARS affected areas/hospitals/countries. The kids are questioned everyday when they arrive to school whether they are feeling well, etc. Next week they are saying they will institute giving all the children thermometers to check their temperatures a couple times a day! They still don't know whether the virus is contagious before symptoms are seen, so people who aren't quarantined could be passing it around too. I just say, we gotta live our lives as long as God ordains, and so let's get on with living them!    D: I KNOW that your parents were very proud of seeing you in LITTLE VIOLET AND THE ANGEL!  Your mom said it was a different role for you.  I got the impression that you were the bad guy!  Were you?     K: YES! I was AWFUL!!! Not in a characatured sort of way, but in the way that made some people (adults!) in the audience cry because I was too much like the unloving mothers/women in their lives (no one sets out to be a villain, we all have our reasons for meanness - for this lady, it was being wrapped up in her grief). It all worked out in the end...I got what I deserved - I realized I'd been awful...and then I died!    D: I just didn't get that impression from what I read.  I felt that you were the grief-stricken mom--period.  Can you tell me more about it?  Were you exhausted from your schedule of performance?  It seemed that once you started, you didn't quit!  How did YOU feel about your performance?  How about Jim?  and the boys?--Did they see you perform?    K: Jim and the boys loved it. Jim was traveling when the show opened, but the boys and our helper came a few times. I was able to get them backstage passes (which is a big thing since this arts center only opened in January, and it's pretty shwanky). THey liked meeting and hanging out with the other actors and being backstage and playing with the puppet VIOLET. Cameron (6) was troubled that I died. He wished I could have been one of the puppeteers giving voice and life to the child instead.  But Cameron really liked the song I sang (a real tear jerker - showed the lady's soft side!) and he often sings it to me now. I felt happily and thoroughly exhausted when the show was over. I slept a lot more the first week after. It was weird getting back to my "real" life of being an unknown mom and going to parent meetings and sitting through piano class with the boys after having been in the spotlights for a solid week. Seemed like I was two people for a few days as I kept wondering, "Did that really happen?" I've been asked to do a few more projects this year. Singing in a concert next month as a "guest" of the three men who are putting on the show. I'll sing You'll Never Walk Alone from Carousel. The 3 men are all definitely NOT Christians, but Jesus loves them, through me. I find it neat here that these very outspoken gay guys will be interested in being my friend - when they know I'm a pastor's wife and am a Christian. I've had some good conversations about their understanding of God and spirituality with 2 of them...we'll see how it goes with this next "gig."     D: Are the boys grateful for a break in school?  It sounds like they are both pretty great students!       K: Tyler's EXTREMELY smart and works hard. We're fortunate that he hasn't had to take extra tutoring in Chinese yet (nearly all his classmates have had tuition since first grade). I was able to do the studying with him until I started getting more involved in projects outside the house last fall. Now, I try to study with him a little - which means him trying to teach me some of what he's learned in class. Cameron is youngest in his class, so he's a bit behind the rest, though he's bright, though a squirrely challenge. I had a single friend over to hang out yesterday. As she listened and observed my afternoon routine with Cameron, she said, "I am going to have to pray for you more! I had no idea what your life was like!"    D: Reading that Tyler had first-quarter exams in English, Math, Chinese and Science sounds like he's in high school or college!  Do you think school is taken much more seriously there?  I can't believe Cameron is in 1st grade already!  (Does the new school year start in January?) It wasn't that long ago, when he was a baby!!!!  Time is flying!    K: YES. YES. YES!    D: Are there any things that you really miss from here that you cannot get there?     K: NOPE! Partly because we have been away and gotten used to the things here, and mostly because so much is available here (even some of the obscure junk food like poptarts!)    D: I hope you don't mind me asking so many questions; I know you must be busy, so respond whenever you can.  In the meantime, please know that I pray for you every day.      K: For the churches here, Jim helps them hook up with in-country works that the particular church could give some short term support to, or "adopt" as a church project. He helps them strategize what their unique contributions can be to partnering with existing work going on rather than starting their own thing from scratch and competing with other mssnaries.   With the incountry networking, he works with many different ministries/groups who's ends are focused on bringing the good news to different Unreached People Groups in a large country to the north of us. Their govt. has said there are 56 major classifications of what they call "Minority Peoples." But truly, there are more than 200 groups, the govt has just bunched similar groups together. Many of these groups have no known Xns or chchs in them.)     D: Thank you for your ministry to honor Jesus Christ globally.  You and your family are heroes/heroine of the faith! YOU TOO! If we're all doing God's will, we are all his heros!    K: Thank you so much for supporting our lives and efforts with your prayers. It really feels like we have partners even when you aren't with us physically. We feel cared for, and strong in the LORD's mighty power!

      My son Cameron has started going to AWANA here in Singapore this year. He's in Sparks. There is one church that has it and it is such a good program.  My job as a missionary is different from what my husband does...but since you asked me, I'll just tell you what I do. My job as a missionary is using drama to help spread Jesus' love and the truths of Scripture for living an abundant life in Christ. I get to do this in many ways.  I taught a course to a group of Sunday school and kindergarten teachers on how to use drama in their classrooms. I've taught a playwriting class to Christian adults who want to use drama in their churches for worship and special events. I've done some writing and other training, and this year will start discipling some of the women I have met through my training times. I have done some drama training for a group of churches in Malaysia and meet with other Christian artists from neighboring countries as they come through town. This year I will go to another city in Malaysia and may go to Cambodia as well. Our family is thinking of going to Thailand to pass out the Jesus Film to tourists from Mainland China, since we all speak Chinese and mainlanders are very facinated with us (and it would not be against the law to give out the Jesus film in Thailand!!!)  Last year I was in a show for children that was sponsored primarily by a church. The show was not a salvation message, but a few thousand school children, including many special needs children were blessed by getting to see a show teaching them good values about sharing and friendship. Most of the cast were Christians. The church has this vision for using the arts in Jesus name to bring blessing and joy to their community. I was able to build trust and friendship with the cast members who are not yet Christians.  In February, I was in a professional production where I had opportunities to share my personal faith in Jesus with the cast and crew as I build relationships with them. The story was about a guardian angel. One day our lead actor (who is this famous actor here in Singapore) came into rehearsal with a terrible pain in his back. I took him aside and asked him if I could pray for him. He was glad for that, and then told me that the pain disappeared when I prayed for him. We were interviewed on radio and he shared with the DJ a very theologically correct description of the purpose of angels (he's been reading!) I think God is doing something in his heart. It has been a great opportunity to develop sweet friendships with non-Christians (who are actually a bit anti-Christian), I trust God will use me in their lives to draw them to Himself.  On the last day of the show I took each person in the cast and crew aside to pray over their lives and that God would show them how much he loves them and that they would see the value of loving him back and living for him. Everyone liked being prayed for...even the athiests!!! We'll see if I get to eventually lead some of them to their decision to follow Jesus. Since the show ended I've been making "dates" to have lunch with different ones. You can pray for me that I would ask good questions like Jesus did of people, and would avoid preaching. This way people come to their realization of their need for God just by talking about themselves.  What I like about Singapore is how God is teaching me that I'm not superwoman - and he's watned me to realize that he loves me whether I am just doing the laundry, or helping my kids study Chinese. It doesn't matter what I do, he just wants me to love him with my whole heart. It's funny when in USA, missionaries are often put on a pedestal as being SuperChristian, but it is in my going overseas that I am learning about my frailty and dependence on God. I am learning to see Him do things through my weaknessess instead of my competence. This is a good and HARD lesson to learn!  Love, Mrs. Creasman

We have a lady around the block who is wearing the mask.  There is a lot of fear but very unfounded.  It's sad, some people have stopped buying things made in Asia.   Your days are full.  Mine have slowed down this year.  I think I started back to fast after surgury last year and my body is kind of rejecting life right now.  So, Dan and I descided I should slow down a lot this year and just let my body heal.  It was one of those things that was so God, I still am amazed. Each doctor I go to always asks if it was a relative and when I say it was someone from my church, they can't believe we actually matched.  It makes me realize that nothing is by chance and God planned this before time.  It is still a very aahh thing and God's love is so amazing.  I still don't know why God used me, He could have used anyone, yet He allowed me to give.  I feel so blessed.  Anyway talk about more than you ever wanted to know.   What kind of food do you eat.  Pizza, but is it pizza like here or pizza with corn and fish on it(Japanesse like pizza) or something in the middle.  Isn't it amazing how fast children pick up other languages?  Did your children speak with an accent?  I know people are amazed when they learn English is Daniel's second language but he learned it in school at such a young age.  Well this has gotten long, I hope you don't mind.  Thank you for answering all my questions.  Love, jan    MY REPLY...   We have a California Pizza Kitchen here! (not that I eat there!) When we were in China it took us awhile to get used to the style of pizza made by the pizza place we had in Kunming...Chinese pizza...thin crust..not too tasty, but close enough.  And then we had to go to Italy for some meetings in 1998. In going out for pizza there, we discovered that "Chinese pizza" was the authentic kind - ITALIAN!  Loved hearing your testimony (below). Life is full of seasons isn't it? Of the many books I'm enjoying, today it's the books TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE and THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK...two non-C books that encourage us to be grateful and full of love for others and life.  As for my Wednesday, I'm cruising through my day fully aware that I am completely dependent on Jesus(even with both my kidneys!),  K!M

       K!mberly's days are always different - probably like most moms! So far today has been:      !  Rolling over in bed for some extra sleep while Jim sent kids to school (I was at an artists prayer meeting last night until 12...oh, I'm not as young as I used to be!)   !  devotions over breakfast   !  taking our little dog in to get fixed (ouch)   !  grocery shopping (with our maid - I love that part!!!)   !  following up emails with pastors who may host a play I'm casting this month   !  a phone call with Juwanda the production manager of a concert I'm singing in later this month. He's stressed, muslim, and gay; so our phone conversation included a prayer over the phone for him: that God would prove He's real and loves him today by giving him a supernatural measure of peace and joy in his work. He said, "Kim, I wish you could be part of every show I do!" He is a sweetheart who really needs Jesus!   !  coordinating emails with some Christian women in theatre. I'm doing a half day retreat with 5 gals later this month to talk over half of the book THE HEART OF THE ARTIST. I'm really looking forward to it!   !  kids home soon. We'll work on homework together (I'm hopelessly behind Tyler in Chinese!). Get the chores done. Practice piano...   !  it's 2 for 1 pizza night at our pizza shop across the street and we're having dinner guests. Cameron calls Dick Soo, "my best big friend" and Dick's girlfriend Neelam. Both are young professional actors who've been dating since the end of last year. Both come from really dysfunctional families (I know that both are still emotionally and verbally abused at home). He's a professed Christian, she's a professed atheist. But I think that's only temporary! :-).   !  kids'll go to be at 8:30 and we'll see what God has in store for our conversation after!    This is probably more than you need to know. Ah me, I do love avoiding work by writing! That'll teach you to ask me questions! Love, K!M

      I can certainly understand people's concern given that the number of cases here (a little more than 200) still represent a high percentage of the total population (4 million) compared with other places that have been hit.   We feel very safe here  for several reasons.     For one,   almost all the cases have been traced to a few people that brought the virus into the country. The secondary and tertiary infections have for the most part been hospital staff.    For another  , the government has done an excellent job of taking swift and thorough measures to contain the spread of the disease. Everyone infected has been isolated in one hospital, and for every one of them, another 10-20 people who had contact with them has been quarantined for 10 days. Those that break quarantine are now being isolated in jail.  As you probably know, all schools were closed for three weeks, and now every school child has a thermometer and must log their temperature two times a day. Parents are no longer allowed on campus. Most government buildings now require a screening for fever in order to enter. We are in many ways blessed to live in an environment that is strongly controlled by the government.    Thirdly,   voluntary precautions are being taken by lots of people. Many people are staying at home and avoiding crowds. Many places are now going to start logging in with your entrance times and contact numbers (such as movie theatres and clubs) so that people can be traced in case an infection shows up. Our church of nearly 3000 people took everyone's temperature last Sunday morning to get into the service!    Fourthly,   these measures seem to be working. The growth in cases stopped a few weeks ago, and for the past two days there have been no new cases.    And fifthly  , but not last and   not to be preachy  , we know the Lord wants us to be strong and courageous. We have sensed his leading in decisions like this over and over, when he gives us confidence in his sovereignty over our situations, even during the times when we get apprehensive about the consequences. We believe Christians can have a great witness, especially in times like these, by walking by faith in the true sense of getting our direction from the Lord and resting in him.  Hope this is helpful. I'll pray the Lord gives you all a clear sense of his leading in this situation, and what would be right for the team, families, church, and mission.  Blessings!   written by Jim Creasman to friends at Fullerton Evangelical Free Church, CA   "Wait patiently for the LORD.      Be brave and courageous.      Yes, wait patiently for the LORD."

      We're in a new cell group here with 2 other families (Invited by the USC docrtoral grad who's a communications professor here - the friend of Jim's through the China connections who'd go out for coffee with him during Cameron's AWANA program on Sunday afternoons this spring). The other family is Finnish, but they'll be moving to Jakarta in July. Finnish! He workds for Nokia. I've never met anyone from Finland before!!! They've lived in Uzbeckistand, India, Australia... and they seem so NORMAL! Anyway, when she was asking us last night to pray for her about leaving her Bible study with unsaved Japanese women, and their needing a new leader that she could trust, I said, "Too bad the Webbs aren't considerring moving here until next year [a CRM couple who we adore who currently live in Indonesia]. Lori Webb speaks fluent Japanese and is the life of the party!" Can you believe that the world is so small that this Finnish woman KNEW Lori? Lori had come here for a conference last fall and SAT next to the Finnish couple!!! She'd even met some of the Japanese women from the Bible study!   Today a young woman came up to me while I was studying with Tyler in the public library. I didn't recognize her, though I've known her pretty well: she's the teenaged daughter of a good friend of Liu Yi Yan - my best friend from Kunming. He communist parents are very wealthy and have had her studying in Singapore for a few years now. We've only seen her a couple of times. We've tried to hook up with her more, but, ya'know, we're friends of her PARENTS....that's not too cool. I've known her as a very spoiled, uninteresting, and self-absorbed brat. Today she was this LOVELY young woman. She recognized me first and told me that she's become a Christian! Wow. Her school friends had started taking her to church with them when she was feeling blue at Chinese New Year. That made my day (well, that and having a great time studying with Tyler in a beautiful spot).  Kids are excited that this is the 3rd weekend Bob and Louis (their friends who are brothers) came to church with us. The mini-van is starting to come in handy!   Kids practices for their English composition exams by writing you letters, so look for them in your mailbox in about 10 days! Tests were all put off as long as possible. I love their school - many schools just made the kids cram to keep on schedule. THey've had their oral exams and 2 English Composition exams. They have Math tomorrow, Chinese on Tuesday and Tyler has Science on Wedensday. Neither boy is nervous about it and have prayed that they can encourage their classmates who are stressed out about their scores. The last day of the term is Friday, but we think we'll skip it! Tyler has to be back for extra classes the first week of the "holiday" 8am-12...at least it's a shorter day!

      Entertained last night. Our Finnish friends are leaving Singapore next Sunday so we had a dinner party. MMMMmmmmm. Loonni's day off so Kimberly had the kitchen to herself (Loonni made a yummy thai noodle salad and helped me with a dill potato salad ahead of time). I made some herb sourdough bread in the breadmaker, deviled eggs and I tried something new: Marinated chicken breasts and baby onions in a sun-dried tomato salad dressing (can't remember what brand), then broiled it (since we have no bbq). It was a hit!   We're going without sugar for a family "fast" this month. So dessert was fruit dipped in plain yogurt, and unsweetened coconut flakes or grapenuts...kind of like fondue without a flame.   Don't entertain much, but I'll tell you it's sure so much more fun when you have a Loonni to do all the clean up afterward!

       urlLink    2003 Tyler and his best friends Tom, Bob, and Ben (don't you love those Chinese names?)  Tyler had 3 10 year old boys over Friday afternoon and I had a heartbreaking conversation with one of them. He admitted to me that he had to lie to his parents to be in our house (YIKES). The boys normally have extra classes on Friday afterschool, but they were cancelled this week, so his folks thought he was still at school. His parents won't let him go to ANYONE'S house or have any friends over until he's 18...really sad. We talked about their rules being set in order to protect him from people with bad character, but he feels that he must lie to keep from being beaten, when he doesn't want to be a "liar." I asked him about his guilt in lying to them and whether it was worth it to come over. Maybe we can find ways to let them play without his lying to his parents. After we talked for awhile he said, "Thanks Auntie. Don't tell anyone what I told you about them, but it really kinda makes me feel better just to talk about it. My chest feels better.").

        Today my child stayed home from school.    I’m being a responsible citizen. I’m teaching my children to care for the welfare of his fellow man. He was not feeling well. He didn’t have a fever, but he had an active cough and a runny nose. He was probably contagious. He’d probably have had everyone around freaked out that he might have SARS.    My child stayed home from school today.    Even though today was the day for his very first Maths exam. Ever.  He’s P1, and Math is by far his best subject. A subject he’s proud of his ability in. It's the one subject that buoys his waning self-confidence when weekly he gets poor marks on spelling tests and ting-xie.    Today my P1 child stayed home from school.    And today I learn that the child who misses an exam for a valid reason has no opportunity to make it up.  It will be written “VR” on his report card. A “valid reason.”   Next time  I’ll think twice about whether my child infects his classmates.   Next time  I’ll have learned more about the very “valid reason” for a distasteful Singaporean quality called “Kiasu.”   Next time  will I start thinking like a Singaporean parent?   “Who cares if he spreads his germs to his classmates? My child should get the chance to show what he’s learned after all his hard work.”   But this time, he’ll get a “VR” for Maths and they’ll average his scores from the subjects he struggles in.  That’s the policy.  As a foreigner, it has been our choice to put our children in local schools. We're not forced into this option and we’ve been happy with our choice so far. The positive, we believe, outweighs the negatives. It's a good education overall.  BUT we’re learning the system.   The system that now is so hyper about healthy kids that they are being questioned each day when they enter the school grounds.  A system that now has them checking their temperature during school hours.  And yet a system that doesn’t allow for illness on exam days.  A flawed system.  If I were a parent who really cared about his test results I’d have him miss his Mother Tongue test for a PAPERCUT.  The note would read:    “My child was feeling poorly on the day of the test…”   I'd manage to make it sound like a VR.     Will someone give me a VR for Singaporeans to start caring about each other?    Unlike the parents of my child's classmates, I don’t care so much about what my child’s average scores are, or where he falls in the class ranking. He doesn’t have to stay in the system as long as his classmates do.  His classmates are the ones who, starting with this exam, will scratch and claw for being top in their class until they are selected (or not) to be eligible for University.  My child with the “VR” will go to University if he applies himself, and we responsibly save for his education.  He will go to University as long as his self-confidence isn’t permanently damaged by having this VR averaged in on his very first series of exams.  BUT    Because my child stayed home from school today   He won’t have the right to show himself how very much he’s learned in Math. He won’t have the chance to gain confidence from this milestone. At the tender age of 6 he’ll surely feel the socially inflicted shame that will inevitably come from his poor showing in English, or his barely passing Chinese (if indeed he does PASS!).  Ah, me. Perhaps I’m making a  mountain out of a milestone.     No.   It’s the principle of such policies that have got me riled up. Singapore wants her citizens to be socially responsible.  Singapore shouldn't need to make laws to govern our consideration for one another. Yet Singapore penalizes those of us who are socially responsible and courteous. And continues to teach us to know better    Next time.

      GREAT TIME Soaking in the beauty and relaxing! The beach pictures were just one afternoon we took a boat ride to a nearby island then rode back in a THUNDERSTORM!!!   urlLink    Cameron, Reuel, & Tyler's boat ride in Thailand&nbsp; urlLink     We haven't met our maid Loonni's son. He lives a 15 hour bus ride from where we were. This little boy in the picture is a Singaporean neighbor friend from our first year here (the only little boy who's mom would let him come to play!). He and his sweet family moved to Bangkok at the end of our first year here but we've kept in touch and his parents let him miss 2 days of school to go with us to the beach. Praying for them...they were missionaries with a church here and got pretty burned. They've still not settled in a church in Bangkok, and sounded like they are not really looking right now...     Our Helper Loonni Worships in her own language.     We let her go on her own with our friends there...They are VERY sensitive and clever about indigenizing worship to fit the culture, so she was amazed how "ISAN" the worship felt to here. And, by her going with out us, this way she was the center of attention (and not us). She was asked to share her testimony. Which was really good for her to do. She and I talked about it for an hour the next morning. I'm sure she'll be telling her friends at church here about it this afternoon!    We'll be stuffing newsletters to send home this week :-) Always fun to put it together and send it to the printer, but SO glad for Loonni to help us with the folding and stamping and stuffing!   Helping Cameron prepare for 3 days of exams this week (he's SIX!)   Planning a week of drama training in Cambodia with mostly youth (three groups - one a christian arts ministry and the other church plants one in the city and one in a village). Studying Cambodian culture, and praying about what would work best cross culturally. Picking what themes and what aspects of drama to cover. Hoping and praying I can connect with a team from our church that is going to another church in Cambodia do a similar thing the week before I go with 5 others from other churches! Ah isn't God amazing how he orchestrates our lives and if we just listen, the harmonies are so beautiful!   I had a HEART OF THE ARTIST retreat last Thursday evening which was our second time together and only one woman was the same as the first group. There are a half dozen or so single women, actors, who have separately mentioned they'd like to get together for lunch soon, so I need wisdom in knowing who to call and what God has in mind...   We're going to expand ANNE FRANK to 55 minutes (from 35) for the stage in November, so need to start planning what technically and script-wise we need to do to make the show more theatrical and meaningful. The reason my heart is involved in the project spiritually is that I believe that God can use the story to convict our young audiences about the depravity of man...when so many want to believe that man is basically GOOD, this is evidence that we are rotten at the core...But need to do it in a way that isn't "religious," and let God's Spirit take over from the impact of the show...So, I need His inspiration.

        I sang in church!     I do think that the service was really special, and it was really great to be a part of God's Spirit ministering to people in the congregation through our voices. For the two years we've attended this church I've helped the drama ministry a little bit (Got to direct a sketch last year, and 3 from the church were in MISSING BODIES cast, some of them have been in workshops, I had to even say "no" about being involved in helping produce their Christmas drama this year, which was quite an honor to be asked, but wrong timing for me to jump in on the project...).    A few months back I met for lunch with the drama leader and the Creative Arts pastor. That's when the "secret" got out that I'm able to sing. I told them about the Bank commercial/song and being invited to sing in the   3 Men and a Boot   concert. I didn't mention that I thought it was very sad and strange that my homosexual anti-God friends have gotten to know me faster than people in the Creative Arts Ministry of my church. In fact the first time I had a meal with someone from the Creative Arts ministry I was desperatly lonely (probably a certifiable nut case) and that person said,  "Oh, now that we know you're here for awhile, we'll have to figure out how to use you."  Now, I'm sure it was an innocent statement with no intention to hurt, but I allowed Satan to twist it in my heart to mean  "YOU'RE not worth getting to know, as a person, and I'm kind of threatened by you, but I'd sure like to 'USE' you for what you can do to help me."   Wow. It really hurt at the time, but God has healed that hurt and used those circumstances to confirm his work for me here in Singapore.    Anyhow, I can no longer be just a bench warmer every week at church. I believe they are supportive of my time being mostly invested in connecting with Christian and non-Christian dramatists beyond our local church, so I don't feel pressured to and guilty that I can't spend my weekends singing with the choir.    Oh how I much prefer singing when the lights are off on in the house and I can't see the audiences faces (reactions) to me! It's less intimidating to sing "in character" in a spotlight, than to be myself up there...Even though Rolling Hills Covenant Church is so much bigger a church, I didn't ever have that feeling there, or the church I grew up in, since it was always like singing for family and friends :-)   Given we have so few we can call "friends" at church (the couple from our last newsletter who were recently married have been so sweet to us!), and I'm so obviously a white lady in a sea of Asian faces (and don't ever want to come off high and mighty as "the foreign expert"), I was feeling a bit more "scrutinized," and downright scared to sing! But, the choir was warm and friendly to me in the practices, someone gave me a "Creative Arts Ministry" t-shirt, and once I survived the first service without messing up the words (or passing out!), God really worked to heal my heart about all this past baggage and made me feel "a part" of this congregation instead of still a visitor after 2 years attending.    This experience from the past 2 years has really shown the light for us on how   newcomers to churches can get really lost and struggle with meeting people.   With James and I solid followers of Jesus and are really committed to the local church I think  how much harder  for many people finding their way back to church, or trying out God for the first time...They are a little nervous about it, wondering what God might be doing in their lives.   Surely they find it intimidating and easy to be invisible.   They are not necessarily going to know how to get involved in the body life of a large church.   Our church here has what I've called "the gauntlet" of ushers at the main door to greet you when you come in. Which is great to have people so friendly and warm, I mean REALLY friendly! But combined with my depression and lonliness the first couple of years, and an inability to find anyone at church we could get past  "hello. God bless you. nice to meet you. hallelujah."  with, this "gauntlet" felt so shallow and  fake  to me. I dreaded it as a necessary evil to endure in order to enter the worship service. See I told you, I'm a certifieable nut case! But one who can now identify with all the rest of the hidden hurting people who cross the threshold of our churches every weekend.   Anyhow, we sang this song from the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir "He's Been Faithful!" Wow! It was one of those songs where the choir comes in beautifully in the chorus. It was really sweet. And I think the word got out among the 20or so person choir about our not knowing many people, 'cause they were all REALLY friendly to me, and the congregation was busy looking at the words on the screen so I didn't feel so scrutinized, and when I did connect with people's eyes, they were smiling. A young actor friend and her blues band/guitarist boyfriend came to support me, and when I saw them in the audience they were BEAMING, then I knew how God could work through the lyrics in their hearts and lives which made me really happy to see them there. All in all, I feel that through this invitation to sing, Jesus has used this weekend to heal hurts probably not just with me, but with other individuals in the ministry as well as the congregation. Healing that probably we'll have to wait till heaven to hear all about! This is just my story. :-)   Love, Kimberly

      We're having a little Pumpkin party tonight with about 10 of the boys' school friends. They are scheming what costumes they'll make up or borrow...there is no Halloween here (thank goodness!)  We're going to eat American STEW and biscuits downstairs and play a few games. Then we'll go "trick or treating" to the homes of the boys who've come...  I'm praying today for inspiration to teach them spiritual lessons through the games. Last year I told them a "spooky story" about the evil prince who wanted to overthrow the king, and hates all human children, and how the king threw him and all his soldiers out of his kingdom, but they are still working against the king trying to mess things up here on earth. You should've seen their eyes! Finally one little boy says, "I get it! It's supposed to be the Devil right?!"

      I'm nuts. I moved to Singapore just in time for the millenium after spending the first half of her life on the other side of the world (Los Angeles). As a director in Singapore, I've also worked for itheatre on SINCERLY ANNE FRANK (2003) and teamed up with Paul Seow of All Good Gifts for THE CASE OF THE MISSING BODIES. As an actor, I was seen in 2003 as Anna Maria in itheatre's LITTLE VIOLET AND THE ANGEL. Also swam for two runs of RAINBOW FISH as Starfish (2002), and 3 times appeared as a game show host, Barbie Kew, for Trinity Christian Centre's XCEPT THE XCHANGE (2001). Currently a Tampines Tai Tai where in addition to her occassional forrays into Singapore theatre; I apply my creative flair to making ours the funnest house for all the neighborhood children, and seeing my two primary aged boys grow in wisdom and character as well as knowledge.

       Written to my inlaws Howard and Lynn after returning from visit to Atlanta and Virginia.    (Get yourself a cup of tea and sit down! This has turned out to be a long letter!)   I'm checking in this early am (can you say: JET LAG?) to let you know that the package you sent for Cameron's birthday came yestererday! I'm sorry to not have followed thru much on their wish lists for Christmas. They are so content these days that they didn't have much to say about what they want. ADDED to that, Jim and I were in over our heads in November - and couldn't get on top of everything. By God's grace we didn't let anything earth stopping fall through the cracks! Now that I'm back, our December and into 2004 is thankfully open to do more relaxing and putting around and digging ourselves out from under the piles that have grown while we were out saving the world thru Jim's conferences and my drama.    Kids are sure happy boys these days. They got up early too and we did some reading. When they got down on the floor to start playing Star Wars action figures, I made my exit to my office! Jim stayed home yesterday as we unpacked and cleared clutter - getting ready to put out the decorations and tree today. He's off soon for an early morning and full day today (he took the car!).    Before my suitcases were unpacked, Jim had me busy helping him with a Christmas mailing to all those who've made donations to our account this year, thanking them for their generosity. We sure feel loved when we look at the list of those who give. I know sometimes you've worried about this for us, and I just want you to know how confident we are in God's provision. We're not living like kings, but we are so comfortable. Very comfortable compared to many of our colleagues. So many missionaries struggle with trying to make ends meet month by month. This far, Jim and I have been very blessed to not have to have our hearts and minds constantly occupied with these concerns. We don't have to spend much time each month checking the giving to CRM in order to make life or ministry financial decisions. Still, over the 4 years we have had a few drop off for various reasons.   ON the BIRTHDAY FRONT: We're just now beginning to plan a little birthday party for Cameron this Sunday afternoon. Doing it a Singaporean style (we've participated in a time or two): Calling a couple of his little friends ahead of time, and then taking the snacks and cake downstairs to the playground to share with whoever will be playing then!   Just so you know, I DIDN'T take the boys into the District this trip. It snowed the first night in Virginia (5"!). IT started flurries on our drive home from the airport! The boys kept busy building forts and igloos and feeding the cows and playing in the Lassiters basement that had been finished the day before we arrived. I just didn't want to enjoy taking them there on my own...without daddy along... and (especially after hearing your little tale of making the pact with Walt to take this unborn grandchild to DC when he is eight!) There is the remote possibility that in the future YOU might feel up to making the trip with them...(All things are possible! I know the healing is slow, but we are praying for you to gain your strength back day by day!).   ALSO: While on our trip, I did venture to the toy store and walmart (in both Georgia and Virginia!) and came home with suitcases full of Christmas gifts. I'll sit down with Jim to sort them out, but want to tell you that I did get some sure fire winners with the boys for their birthdays and Christmas. Would you mind giving me a budget for their gifts? I do know for sure that two awesome STAR WARS board games will be from you. The boys didn't see them in the stores (they were too busy looking at the Star Wars action figures in another row) and I know that they will be excited about such a surprise. I may find a few more things in the next 2 weeks, but they really will have enough to give from both us and YOU, if we call it quits with what I've already picked up.    If it's alright with you, and you haven't made other plans, Jim and I have decided to put your Christmas budget for us toward an "i pod" for him (a little portable digital music gismo that holds thousands of songs - Jim's diversion is his music these days), and a new cell phone for me. This time I'm thinking of having it surgically attached so I can't lose it. We want to go shopping for them the next time we have a date night. I'm charging everything these days on American Express - triple points! We're going to look into using them for frequent flyer trips in May to come see you! We'll probably need to get those reservations done this month!    FOR YOU: My parents have come home with a bagfull of gifts to bring by to you two to put under your tree. Souvenirs from all our travels this year...We've sure been to a lot of places this year! We hope you'll like them.   I picked up a novel at the airport in Detroit on our way back and read it...It made me think of you two SO MUCH that I can't wait to send it to you. Have you heard of John Grisham's SKIPPING CHRISTMAS? It was a fun story I really enjoyed it, and it made me miss you two SOOOOO much!   Write when you can. We sure miss you.   The boys are begging me now to leave my cave and help them get out the fake tree and start DECORATING!

      It's the year of the Monkey!  We are all enjoying a couple of free days. Yesterday was the beginning of the Chinese New Year.  On a whim, cameron wore a Kung Fu outfit and china-man hat with the ponytail in back to school on Wednesday when they only had a 2 hour day and suggested that all the children wear red - he ended up winning a cash prize for the best dressed boy in the school! He was so proud of himself! "I had to go up in front mom! And not just in front of my class...THE WHOLE SCHOOL!" Tyler said he led the crowd in cheering the loudest for Cameron. They were both very cute about it.  urlLink    Cameron dresses up for Chinese New Year&nbsp; urlLink     On New Year's eve we went as a family to see CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN and laughed our heads off. That family is so much like how the Lassiters live (only with a few less kids) it made us remember fondly our visit last month. Except for fast food and cinema, most shops are closed since Wednsday afternoon, and some will stay closed through Saturday.   When we got back from Malaysia we caught a bad cold from Loonni! She feels really bad about it! First Cameron then Jim, Kimberly, and it looks like Tyler has the strongest immune system - he was feeling a bit of the sore throat last night, but felt fine in the morning. It wiped Jim and I out for a couple of days but we're only a bit foggy headed and coughing a little today.   On the afternoon of New Years (Wed), when all of the Chinese world is preparing their family feasts and cleaning their houses (sweep out all the bad to start with a "clean slate"), I thought I'd join in the spirit and not wait 'til Valentines to put away Christmas (like I'd threatened). Cameron, Loonni and one of the boys' friends pitched in. It was a fairly painless few hours...though we have to admit, we've only opened about 1/10th of our Christmas cards. That I've told the family I'd like to do together, so we'll probably finish in time for our visit to USA in June!  urlLink    My old guitar was still at Mom & Dad's! Guests coming thru on Tyler's 11th birthday brought my old 3/4 sized guitar. Thanks 2 mom and dad and the Grimes for making it such a sweet surprise!  The kids are enjoying their birthday and Christmas toys and making some real strides in their music. The 3/4 sized guitar is a big hit. As he learns various notes on the stav, I'm putting little stickers on the correct fret on the guitar. He learned his second song today. SO now he can play a duet with me and one with Cameron. They both are happy campers.

      Last week i told jim that since Christmas 1996 i've jump started my new years feeling like an unprepared water skier. That was the year when we adopted Cameron with three days notice, at the same time we were making decisions about where we'd move overseas to serve as missionaries - which we did only 5 months later!    Unprepared water skiier? Yes. This is how I've started the last 7 years: rushing from the campsite, where I didn't sleep well the night before, my life vest is fastened askew, I somehow have ahold of the bar, but I haven't got the skis on nor have I gotten myself centered and crouched over them. Before I know it, Someone else yells "HIT IT!!!" and I find myself getting dragged (flown) thru the year at high speed clutching the line for dear life wondering if I should keep hanging on, or give up and let go, and sink to the bottom of the river!    This year, 2004, it was wonderful, I was prepared! I had read up on waterskiing, worked out a bit before the trip, well suited life vest on, I got both of the skis on in the shallow water, I was carefully crouched, and I, KIMBERLY was the one who called out "HIT IT!"    I welcomed in a new year standing up, enjoying the rush of walking on water. I'm not afraid of falling (I know I will). Because I'm confident in the life vest, and secure in the strong line connected to the one who's powering the speed boat!    Jim's been reflective too. Ignoring the fact that there's a huge pile in the inbox...e-inbox mostly (I don't know how he juggles it all), but he's learning to take himself less seriously, and even "dropping the ball" here and there - something I've NEVER seen him do. But GOOD for him. He's the kind of capable person who manages to keep his ball in play while picking up others' dropped balls as well.    Since the 2nd, both kids are off to a new year at their "little" school across the street (little here is just under 1000 students). They are happy, healthy, still sweetly holding my hand as we walk to school together. Cameron, now in his 2nd year of Primary School is proud of knowing the ropes and come home each day with a report of how his new teacher thinks he's a good boy. Tyler with the rest of the 5th graders has been assigned a 1st grader to look after at recess time the first 2 weeks of school He's also signed up to help with the "buddy reading program" for slow younger readers afterschool.    For a few weeks Tyler (10) has been wanting to learn guitar. When I suggested that I teach him a few things before we commited him to a class, I got out the dusty guitar from under Jim's side of the bed, tuned it up, and played a simple Christmas carol to my stunned son. I relish these pre-pre-teen moments where he still thinks I'm the most excellent mom. He merely said, "You play the Guitar TOO?" (as if knowing C, D, and G chords means I "play"). It's been fun to teach him, see his enthusiasm, and feel that old sting on uncalloused fingertips. He just wants to know how long until he can play like Marty in BACK TO THE FUTURE.

       urlLink    42nd Birthday!&nbsp; urlLink     My quiet birthday was nice. Kids both had used their own money to buy me a present that was pretty surprising. A first.  In the evening I had a rehearsal for our upcoming Easter production. When it was coming to an end one of the gals husband (the couple JIm and I did the wedding for) came in, in front of everyone there, and gave her a bouquet...I said, "sweet! what's the occassion?" She smiled and said, "Your birthday" and handed them to me. Pretty dear.  I also got 1AM call from Cynthi Knight in Arizona! Her anniverswary is the 23rd so she remembered. I didn't care that she remembered when I was sleeping! How nice that I have a friend who calls me on the other side of the world!  I feel like most of my days are spent regrouping from the piles that gathered from last year's busy-ness and helping the kids pass school exams. Started reading a new book:  Sacred Pathways-Discovering Your Soul's Path God . Helping me to explore beyond Cognative Left Brain patterns of worship, and relating to God. That is about the only style I've really ever known - or thought was acceptable (and is actually so WRONG for how he made me).  Kids had a day off after the big sports meet for the school this morning. Once it was over at 10:30 I had a houseful of little boys. I made them all shower (As they get older they start to get stinky). I made out some slips with numbers then they drew who would go in which order. Then had them ring the service bell i have on our stairs when they were done. We made a race of it: 5 boys showered in 13 minutes!!! That must be some kind of record!

       urlLink    . written to Ardath Smith   Our time the last 2 weeks with Karen has been so healing that I've told Jim I think I need a new name. After all the things I've learned about myself and the realization in a deeper way how God truly loves me the way he made me. I want to fill you in a little before the next time we talk.  I realized in the last few weeks that though I've always been able to genuinely encourage others about God's unfailing love and acceptance of them, I haven't offered that same encouragement to the gal I see in the mirror. (Bless my dear family -and husband- who until recently I thought of as "all good-which means I'm all bad." They really love me, but they were young and are all pretty non-emotional left brain types who ganged up on to tease and criticize me, and tell me to simply "get ahold of myself" when I was moody and feeling deeply about things).  I've spent a good part of my compliant life as a strange wild artsy type trying to reconcile Me with the models for being a good Christian woman I saw all around me. Though since puberty I've read and tried to be Anne Ortland, or Joyce Landorff, or Emily Barnes or or Cynthia Heald. God did not intend for me to be them. But I just didn't know it, or know that I truly had other options. I do know this is what has drawn me to you - you BEAUTIFUL unique spiritual creature! You have mystified me!  So, for all these years I've been reigning in the deepest parts of my heart. I've been trying to put that weird wild creature on the altar with memorized verses about "not conforming to the world, but being transformed as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing to God."   I've always wanted to be pleasing to God! And from what I was learning about the world around me, I couldn't do that unless I changed who I was. And Scripture seemed to support this notion.  My whole life, I've been interpretting that and all the other verses about "to live is Christ," or "be perfect" by trying to be the idea of what a "Christian woman" is supposed to be: A stereotype ingrained by the evangelical conservative family I grew up in (my mom is superwoman, super-servant, and now is -appropriately- the Women's Ministries Director of her mega-church). Reinforced by the college I attended (Biola a bastion of conforming Christianity). And sealed by the role I married into as a pastor's wife (in a "don't rock the boat" male dominated conservative church where we served for 12 years).   Trouble is, while truly honestly trying to "live my life for Jesus" I'd been suffering a slow death from repression and trying to get my life under control, in essence: stuffing my God-created passionate personality. My creative flair has obviously not been entirely squelched--you can clearly see her manifestations in the arenas where she can be safely wild and passionate: my motherhood and my work in theatre. But outside of these two safe arenas, no one who knows me would deny that I have learned how to "behave." I have (sadly) become a competant, capable, mature Christian woman and have learned to care for and relate to others in thoroughly appropriate and acceptable ways. I've learned a fine art of figuring people out and be for them what they expect me to be. It was when we had our troubles with our teammates here and in our NOT being able to figure out how to be what they wanted us to be - the stress from that began to show in troubling physical and psychological symptoms.   Over the last 20 years, since we began dating, I've experienced unexplainable jealous anger that would occassionally bubble up and be aimed at Jim or other men, or an inner disdain for women who did fit the mold. Now I know that it came from the buried feelings of being a hopeless failure, not knowing what I want to do or be 'cause my options were unattractive or I messed things up, not trusting or believing that God is good to me (he IS good to others, but I don't deserve his goodness), wishing I fit in as easily as Jim does in the circles life has placed us, and trying to stuff my uniqueness all these years.   I've had no trouble identifying with Paul, "for me to live is Christ, and to die is gain." 'Cause really, I was already dead deep inside, and heaven was a hopeful alternative to my joyless existence.   Karen asked me what I was afraid of if I were to "let go" and I was embarassed to say what I felt and saw - If I were to let go, I would start crying and never stop.   No, worse than that. If I were to let go, the roof would blow off this muti-storey cement apartment building and we'd all be buried alive in heaps of rubble. If I were to let go, and let my heart free, the earth would explode from its core and we will all die! She laughed and asked Jim who was going to tell me that I didn't have that kind of power. Of course.   But what could such strong images and fears mean?  The past few weeks have ignited the fuse to begin exploding my long-ago planted, ingrained, blossomed and root-bound notions of who I'm supposed to be. I've got to go demolish the hopeless idea that God wants me to "get myself under control" to be acceptable. I have to go back and start on a path of hope for finding out who this bizarre and beautiful creature God made me to be. So that THEN I can put her on the altar to burn up for Him!    urlLink    April 2003 Discovering the Orchid Garden with Ardath Smith

      Had a touching talk with Tyler at bedtime. He reluctantly told me about how he began to cry in children's church while singing - he couldn't understand what had come over him, was embarassed by his tears, but he felt close to God. He's been wrestling with Biblical ideas of Heaven and Hell (more specifically friends who may not accept Jesus as their saviour and Lord and are doomed!), He's seen alot of suffering in the world, and wonders how God could be just, merciful, all-powerful and loving (which is also news we get from the Bible) with all the messes that are in this world...and on top of that - we've just got these small brains to figure Him out from the Bible and the sense of his presence that we can only feel....  So, God just loved him this morning with an "I'm present" reminder of his love and that his brain is bigger (much bigger) than ours!  He went to sleep imagining himself like a flea...How could he, if he were God explain to a flea the ideas of happiness, or saving money, or traveling to USA, or .... the flea just wouldn't get it!

       urlLink    2004 April: Cameron with his favourite character GOOFY at Mickey's 75th Birthday Party in SIngapore.  Cameron's teacher wanted to meet with me. She had some concerns. Uh, oh. Then when I meet with her she tells me what last year's teacher said when I talked to her: he's a great kid in class, pays attention, and is very  sweet and obedient. Still, why does he score 10/40 in both English and Math last week? His Chinese was about the same.  She wondered if perhaps its because of big brother Tyler doing so well in school, or???? She wanted to know how things were at home with him. His sense of support or self-esteem. She didn't know that I'd asked to speak with the remedial teacher last year and spoke with the school's consulting psychologist and had Karen living with us last month for 9 days observing him (all of us)....  We talked for awhile and in the end felt like perhaps it comes down to his being a kinesthetic learner, younger than most of his classmates, and not paying attention well to reading the questions on the test. I told her about his thinking his teachers are little godesses and she ought to take advantage of that in encouraging him to write neatly etc. He really wants to please her! She sounded confident that he has a great support system at home and I got the confidence that she really cared about him and would do what she could to help him in class.   urlLink    April 2003 What happens when Cameron is sent to time-out and discovers that baby powder makes good white-face.

A week of outdoor adventures, swimming and scouting around for little boys while parents had meetings! This all with other little boys who they get to see at least once a year the past number of years. Cameron and Tyler are very independent in this place with these people - off on their own before we're ready to join them for breakfast, etc..Cameron said one day, "Mom, I'm sorry I'm ignoring you so much, but I get to see you all the time. These guys here I only see once a year...I hope you understand...I still love you..." What a charmer.   It's a Very relaxed beautiful tropical atmosphere where we have some fun and learning and lots of good food.   This week Mike and Katie Crow brought their SWEET older boys along - in late teens, early 20's and those big boys were 4 years apart - I kept looking at them and thinking what Tyler and Cameron will be like in another 10 years....   urlLink    KC loves JC: How can I be anything but happy with such a great guy?

       urlLink    Skipping school for a birthday party.  Maundy Thursday started with a 75th Birthday Party, for MICKEY MOUSE. The kids were on the local news that night, though we didn't catch it (one of Ty's friends did and called to say "NOW I know why you left school early!!!" Tyler had refused to tell his friends where he was going. He just said, "I have an appointment!")    Thursday night we had lamb ke-bobs, roti prata (flat indian bread) and grape juice in wine glasses for dinner. Tyler read the Scriptures; Cameron got food all over his clothes; and I snuck away after their bedtime to see a 9:00 showing of The Passion...where I DIDN'T cry. I could'nt for amazement. I was just so overwhelmed and thrilled as I watched: "This is being shown in the Middle East??? Muslims are hearing this by the hundreds?" Who would have ever thought that the Gospel would be preached freely and profoundly in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait because of Mel Gibson's personal spiritual awakening? I am astounded at what God is doing through this film.   urlLink    Good Friday, April 2004: Tyler's first stage performance, my first time adapting a script for Singapore and directing a show for our church Grace Assembly of God. TRAVELING LIGHT.  Friday we were at church from 12 to 10! One of Ty's friends, Thomas, joined him all day at church and Loonni and Cameron came to see both shows. Tyler did a great job! He was really cute as a Singapore road worker...changing the street signs for different scenes. Lots of wonderful feedback. Glad to have done it.

      Our 7 year old, Cameron, came in crying from the playground last night. Only minutes before we were heading out for dinner at the mall and Scooby Doo 2 for "family night."  My tough-high-pain-tolerance-tank-of-a-kid crying hard. "Mommy! Mommyyyy." The I want you to hold me kind of crying.  He said he'd fallen off the top of the slide and landed on the back of his left shoulder. He had movement in his fingers, and mobility in his arm, and it wasn't hanging there like a dislocation...so we gave him some children's tylenol and headed off to the mall! He was still nursing the arm and holding it to his chest at 9, so we went straight to our neighborhood clinic Dr. Tan - who has 2 girls the same ages as TY & Cam. He was just pulling out of the drive, but when he saw us he stopped, and took us back into his clinic to have a look. He did the same things I did and then suggested we, just for safety, take him for an x-ray. It could be slightly dislocated - and only an xray would show that...  Well, a trip to the Emergency Room at Singapore's Children's Hospital later, and a few jokes that if this were an April Fool, he was doing an amazing acting job; he had a very LATE night for a school boy. He's staying home today with his arm in a sling.  Cameron's shoulder is not broken or slightly dislocated...just sprained. The doctor says, "NO PE for a week." Cameron says, "Even gymnastics?" the Dr. laughed "Especially NOT gymnastics!"  I'll take him back for a re-check with an orthopeadic Doctor next Tuesday afternoon before my final dress rehearsal. Jim will be leaving for his trip to China that day...  Just another day in our mundane lives.

        Mother's day was sweet here. Started with wrestling in bed (forget breakfast when you have 2 boys) and after church, spent time looking at pictures. We missed our moms... so a little blue, but excited about our trip to USA next month.   I always have deep heartache when they make a fuss over moms at church...I refuse to stand up. My little protest on behalf of all the single and childless wanna-be mother's who are hurting that day...I'm weird...but it's my conviction.    My mother always commanded us to NOT make a fuss over her on Mother's Day. She thought it was a commercial plot from Hallmark...said, "LOVE ME WELL the rest of the year and you don't have to make a special day for me to assuage your guilt for how you've neglected and taken me for granted!" My mom's a piece of work. I love her!    Kids are in the middle of exams...Chinese tomorrow. We've really been enjoying our kids these last few months. They are fun little terrors. So different, but they love each other. I've tricked them into extending the years they want to come in and snuggle with mom and dad in the morning: I bought a down comforter and exquisitely fluffy down pillows (even though we live in the tropics- we sleep in air conditioning!). It is so cozy they come in every morning...

      I recently submitted the article below for a book that will be published in Singapore later this year.   We were married June 1985 and were infertility patients for approx. 5 years. We saw a specialist for 2 years. We now have 2 children.    Tyler, our 1st child  is our biological son conceived thru IUI, born January 1993 (after 7 ½ years married). Our  second is Cameron  our bi-racial son adopted 4 years later, December 1996, through Bethany Child Services in USA through private adoption.    Our Story   It was 1996 and our first child, Tyler was turning three. We’d been through the ups and downs heartaches of five years of infertility the first time around, it was an emotional roller coaster we didn’t want to get on again. Starting on another journey of infertility treatments was too much of a gamble. We would surely spend too much money and emotional energy on the process and still not have any success in conceiving and delivering a second child.   Psalm 37:4 says,  “Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart.”  The desire of our hearts was to have a second child, and that our first child, Tyler, grow up with the blessing of a sibling. We had always prayed through our years of infertility, “God grant us the desires of our hearts, and if our dreams are not in your plans for us, please change those desires.” So, again we put our faith in Scripture. We focused our hearts and minds on delighting in the Lord, and we were confident that he would, in His way, satisfy our desires.   Another thing we were sure about was that there are many unwanted pregnancies and orphans in the world. We have strong convictions about abortion and caring for underprivileged. It was not a difficult decision for us to begin the procedures to adopt our second child.   Toward the end of 1996 we drafted and sent a letter to the Heath Clinics of all the Christian Colleges in USA, and hired an adoption attorney. We also had registered with a private agency working with women in crisis pregnancies. What follows is an excerpt from the letter we wrote to introduce ourselves to women who were considering giving their baby up for adoption.    "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purposes in Christ Jesus."  Romans 8:28    For our first 7 years of marriage we were eager to be parents. We wondered why God was not granting us the desire of our hearts. Month after month we worked with an infertility doctor. It was a time of disappointment and discouragement, but we had confidence that God always knows what is best. Finally God answered “yes” just before Mother’s Day in 1992.   Four months into our long awaited pregnancy, Jim’s father was diagnosed with terminal cancer that would quickly take his life. Through Dad’s last months of pain and discomfort, God, with perfect timing, had provided a great source of joy: his first grandchild. We hadn’t known through the years of waiting for a child, that God’s timing would be perfect for us. Rarely this side of heaven do we get answers to our questions of why God is slow to answer or silent. In this situation, he was gracious to show us his reasons for answering “wait.” As a newborn baby, our son Tyler was still small enough to be held safely in grandpa’s weak arms in the few months before he died.   Now, here we are, four years later. This little Tyler prays every night that God would give him a baby brother or sister; the desire of our three hearts. Being parents has been the greatest experience of our lives and yet our infertility problems have worsened. Wherever you are, you are reading our letter because you are wondering what the future holds for you and the child you are carrying.   God is a good God, and he cares so much for you, for us, and for your baby. Our prayers are with you as you make these important decisions in the days to come.   With hope for a bright future,   The Creasmans  Jim, Kimberly &amp; Tyler     Two months later, our Christmas cards were delayed in the sending. Here’s the letter we sent out with our cards a few weeks after Christmas:     January 13, 1997   In late August, when we decided to pursue a domestic adoption, we began praying that it would come together quickly; specifically, that a birthmother would choose us by Christmas, December 25th, and that a baby would be in our home early in 1997. Not that God needed a date, but we thought it couldn’t hurt to let him know our desires….   We left December 3rd for a two week mission trip to Asia (we were exploring options for serving in Singapore and Indonesia). We had not been able to finish all of the adoption application paperwork, or the required home study. Never-the-less, while in Indonesia, we received a fax from the agency to which we were applying for adoption. They were notifying us that a birthmother had chosen us. She was due December 25th. “Are you interested?” We faxed back, “YES!”   The day after we arrived back to LA, we learned that the baby had been born early (December 14th). In a whirlwind of meetings, a rush of paperwork, and a fog of jet lag we decided that this 6 pound, 11 ounce baby boy was the answer to our prayers. Only 5 days after arriving home, he was our son! We brought him to church the day he was adopted, and our first week back from the trip. Some people thought that the pastor had brought a baby back as a souvenir! We washed all of Tyler’s newborn clothes with the laundry from our trip!   We are still stunned at how quickly this has happened, yet it is exactly what we prayed for! What a wonder-filled Christmas to hold our adopted newborn while worshipping the newborn Jesus. He came so that we might have the opportunity to be adopted as His children. We thank God for his goodness and have great confidence that He brought Cameron into our family.    More than 7 years down the road now, we thank God everyday for the joy and challenge of raising our boys. We continue to pray whether God would want us to adopt again (though we’re not getting any younger!). There is nothing in life that gives us such a clear picture of our heavenly father’s love for us than being parents. There is nothing better to help us understand and share with others the wonder of being adopted as heirs of God’s kingdom.   Our prayer for you would be that God would deepen your love for, and trust in him as you wait for him to fulfill the longing of your hearts. May He grow in all of us a yearning for him as deep and passionate as our longing to have children. May he strengthen your character and deepen your compassion for others who hurt as you walk this part of your journey.

       urlLink    Ohh dear. Just before I fell out of the O at the entrance to Disney's Calfornia Adventure.    THE RULES    Girls if you learn to abide by these, it will make living with a man much easier:    Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's up, put it down. He needs it up, you need it down. You don't hear him complaining about you leaving it down.   The weekend = sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.    Ask for what you want. Subtle hints do not work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work!  'Yes' and 'No' are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.   Come to him with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what they do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.   Anything he said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 days.   If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask a man.   If something he said can be interpreted two ways and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, he meant the other one.   You can either ask him to do something or tell him how you want it done. Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.   Whenever possible, say whatever you have to say during commercials.   If he asks what is wrong and you say "nothing," he will act like nothing's wrong. He knows you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle for him.   If you make him sleep on the couch he doesn't really mind. It's like camping.

      Of course my little boys loved the fight scenes. I was AMAZED how real the effects were.   (You mean that some of it was FAKE???)   Jim and I thought this one was a bit pedantic and that the plot for the first one had more interesting sub-plots and character development (kind of like THE MATRIX ...nothing like the newness of the first one). It reminded me of how I felt after Star Wars Episode 2: way too much close-ups of good looking leads feeling hurt, misunderstood, confused, or just plain brooding. We got tired of looking at Kirsten D and Tobey so much - and they are attractive people, but ENOUGH already!   I guess I'd been set up for a let down after reading such raving reviews. Even the online reviews from  urlLink focus on the family  were glowing, and for a PG-13 that saying something!  Nevermind, it is a comic book genre, and there were aspects that were marvelous at capturing that feel. As we left the theatre, Cameron looks up to me and says, "Promise me mom that we can get the DVD to THAT one! It was awesome!"
