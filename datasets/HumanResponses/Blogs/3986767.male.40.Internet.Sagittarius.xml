      As a sedentary Computer Engineer / Programmer that has spent too many years behind a desk, I found at 36 I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes. It’s a common enough illness that unfortunately is not treated with the respect it deserves. Killing a full half of it victims by the insidiously slow attrition of pulmonary and vascular health, it leaves the vast majority of those remaining with associated long-term complications that affect almost every part of the body. Diabetes contributes to blindness, heart disease, strokes, kidney failure, amputations, and nerve damage. Not something to take casually but interestingly enough, I meet diabetics all of the time who simply neglect proper treatment because there is no immediate need to worry about it. Diabetes kills over the course of months and years, not days and weeks.  Personally, I took the diagnosis seriously; it was a real wake up call. Frankly it scared the hell out of me. I was 36 years old, an amazing 80 lbs over weight with outrageously high cholesterol and triglyceride levels. As my Doctor put it, I was “Walking towards the light, a prime candidate for pulmonary disease”. All I could do was shake my head and wonder how I had let this happen. I really didn’t know. I had ALWAYS been in excellent physical shape but somehow I allowed my life to be consumed by my work, and day after day of sitting in a cube, writing software and managing computers (my occupation) had lead to lifestyle that was so out of balance that my body simply stopped functioning correctly from the neglect it received.  The day I was diagnosed was the day I started to make positive changes in my lifestyle. I immediately stopped working 60-70 hour work weeks. I started to watch what I put into my body and spend time at the gym. Over the course time I began to see results, lowered blood sugar levels, more energy and better overall health. I was pleased with the progress I had made but still very disappointed in myself for allowing this to happen in the first place. I was also having a really hard time losing weight and just didn’t feel as healthy as I thought I should given all of the work I was doing. I felt and still feel that I owed it to myself to makeup for the years of mediocre to downright poor health and physical neglect. We only live once after all, so why take the cheap seats.  How I going to fix this? I choose to make it a point to get into the best possible physical shape I could and at the same time attack the other areas of my life that I had allowed slip into disarray. Don’t get me wrong, my life was not an absolute mess; it was just a mediocre mess, a life half lived because I forgot to bring the INTENSITY to the table that was necessary to compel me to work hard and be disciplined and successful with EVERYTHING in my life.  First I did a little personal reconnaissance, assessing my diet / exercise habits and talking with my Doctor about it.  She suggested that.  1) I had likely screwed up and slowed down my metabolism by eating too few calories for too long; making my body think that food was scarce. Once again, a balance issue.  2) There is a rather aggravating relationship between Diabetes, Insulin and weight loss, the scope of which is too in depth to cover here and I’m not sure I fully understand it. It is enough to know that it makes losing weight MUCH harder than one might think and I was in this endless cycle that diet, medication and exercise were failing to control.  Nice, really nice. It was about this time that I started to loose my hair, mainly from pulling it out in frustration.  As a kid I was exposed to an “Old School” Tae Kwon Do and Hapkido Do Jang. The people who ran the Do Jang could hardly speak English, all of them Korean and Vietnam War veterans. They were deadly serious about the way they practiced because to them it was a “Martial System” they had employed professionally, not something “to do” on Monday night. I had been told that their system was a derivative of Japanese Karate and an ancient Korean Martial System (or group of “Kwans”) named Hwarangdo, similar to Bushido. These people made a huge impact on the way I view life and as an adult, when I started to look for a more complete and balanced exercise regimen I thought of them, starting a 4 month long search to find a Do Jang that personified that “Old School” martial spirit. I quickly found that what I was looking for was lost to a world of commercialism. I don’t mean to be critical of the typical martial arts school, it’s not my place nor do I possess the technical expertise necessary to offer a meaningful critique, but what I saw in school after school was nothing like what I was exposed to as a kid. The most obvious difference aside from the red and blue foot pads and head gear was the lack of seriousness in how they trained. The Koreans I had met didn’t talk about work or chicks or the weather when they trained; they just trained and trained hard.  Things change.  I started to look at other martial systems and in most cases found the same thing. After a couple of months I was getting a little discouraged. As a fat guy, it was sort of like looking for clothes at Wal-Mart, nothing fit right.  In early August I decided to checkout Jujitsu. The first school was an hour away AND “sports oriented”, I quickly decided it was not my style; the second was a Tae Kwon Do school that also taught Jujitsu, too many red and blue foot pads, again not my style. Then I stumbled upon the Florida Jukido Jujitsu Academy. Amazingly enough, just a short drive away and the first conversation I had with the Sensei was very low key. He didn’t try to get me in to sign a contract, he didn’t talk a bunch of smack about his school or “style”, and as a matter of fact he asked that I wait a couple of weeks to come to class. The school was attending a seminar and would not have time to spend with a new student until they got back.  From the first night as an observer I knew I had found the right place. I quickly realized that Sensei Rego didn’t hype his Jujitsu style because he didn’t have to, these guys were INTENSE, very INTENSE and Jukido spoke for itself. It was all there, discipline, tradition, stunning technique. I knew I was home.    After a rather extensive interview with the Sensei I was invited to join the Dojo and have spent the last 11 months working as hard at Jukido Jujitsu as my body will allow me to.   I hope that this Blog will afford me the opportunity to share my journey with this beautiful Martial Art as well as some of my observations regarding the impact that Jukido Jujitsu has had on me personally. I think I may also be able to provide some constructive advice regarding phisicle conditioning to others who are in less than stellar condition and are considering adopting a hard core Martial Art on as a lifestyle.   Never look to this Blog as a technical reference for Jukido Jujitsu or any other dynamic of an actual process involved in performing specific techniques. I am very wrong as often as I am right when giving advice and if you have a Sensei you should go to him for specific technical questions. If you don’t have a Sensei and would like to know more about Jukido Jujitsu or its Sister art Kokondo Karate let me recommend that you either approach the Main Website for this Martial System  urlLink http://www.ikja.com  or the website for the Dojo that I attend at  urlLink http://www.floridajukido.com.   !OSSU!
