      yoz! i'm back! after one whole week of absence, i'm finally back! man, i miss bloggin....... *starts kissing key board and screen...haha, kidding. i've been kinda busy lately...namely because i've finally started working and bcause of my jie jie's upcoming wedding...wah, u really wun believe wad kinda shit a wedding couple goes through man! though their wedding is like next feb, they're already getting all edgy with the preparations. i'm just the bride's maid man, but i can feel the tension too...woah...its tense i tell you.......the plus point of the whole occasion, for me that is, is that i get to wear this really adorable whole dress...lolx! someone should kick my ass man!   sometimes i really dun get it, weddings are such a big hassle why do people still so eagerly go thru it? i mean, not to say that i'm a big critic or wad but its the truth isn't it? when 2 people love each other, they get married, then they are fufilling God's words but what if they dun? oh, i forgot there is this thingy called divorce nowadays but wun that be breaking God's holy matrimony policy?    "LET NO MAN BREAK WHAT GOD HAS PUT TOGETHER"   in that case, why bother putting it together when u know u might just run the chance of breaking it? if man and woman are made to co-exist, then why do we hear abuse cases every now and then?  *haiz* so many things i dun understand but no one to explain it to me.........maybe i'll jux have to learn it myself.    dear Father in heaven, i pray that as i grow older each day, i will grow wiser too. i pray that i'll grow to be more and more like Jesus, to love and give unconditionally. i pray for the knowledge to understand the ways of this world yet not forget the ways of the kingdom of heaven. i pray for faith and patience to follow in Your ways and not be discouraged and let not my faith in You be waived by the slightest storm.  for all this i pray in Jesus's name, Amen!

       People killing People dying Children hurting And women crying Do you practice what you preach  Or do you turn the other check?  From "Where is the love"  yeah, i'm back. i was reading the morning paper a while ago and once again, i was confronted by the ugly truth and yeah, trust me, its ugly. its like, everyday other day i flip the pages of the papers, there is bound to be some bombing or killing somewhere, wassup with people nowadays?? what the hell do you get from killing off fellow beings? don't they feel any pang of guilt or remorse whenever they gun down someone?? its a person for God's sake! don't they feel anything when they see the relatives and close ones cry about their lost?    hey, why dun u put urself in their shoes and think about it??   oh wait, i forgot, sometimes kill for revenge and for their beliefs. what the heck...... i thought Man were all made to be equal, no one's greater than the other. why is it that if even a monker like me can understand that logic, these self proclaimed "Religious Avengers" can't?? what's so difficult to understand? why can't people just be nice to each other for a while?    why can't people just stop and listen to each other? why dun they listen??    wun life be made a lot easier if people listened to each other and talked about their feelings?? its not easy to completely understnad another person's feelings and emotions but if we at least tried then at least it would help right? what's the point in killing and hurtung others just to prove your point or to proclaim urself superior or just hurt others to get revenge?? what's the point in it all?

      the biggest event of the year just took place this afternoon in the very hall of Riverside Secondary School's holding site in sembawang. students taking this year's GCE O level exams, namely and in particular, ME, Amanda Ang, actually found the a maths paper 2 easy!! Woah.........totally spacey man! *LOLx* well, that was the plus point for the whole day's exam, downside is that the chemistry paper really sucked! yeah........dun tink i gonna score very well for my combine science... feel so stupid suddenly. its like the pure science students have to do the subjects pure wor....and not many of them are complaining about plus, they are like scoring A's for it while me, i'm just doing it as a combine subject, its like half of their toughness man! and i'm already struggling like crazy.........boy, i feel stupid.   sometimes i really dun get it, how is intelligence determined? by a certificate telling the world how well u can memorise the textbook? or how well u can pull math questions apart and solve it? haiz..........i dun get anything! hrm.........maybe i'm like thinking too much and too deeply about too many stuff........its making my life really complicated and stuffy! i mean i'm a well feed, well breed kid, i should just be enjoying my life and youth man! why the heck am i getting all worked up about work starvation and the education system for?? maybe i should just learn to accept things the way they are like everyone else has............maybe that would like really make things a lot easier and simpler, maybe it'll make my day a lot brighter and a lot happier... what do you think?

      alright, forget my previous entry. i was rambling along, i mean hey, i jux woke up man............doubt my mind is even working right...anyhow, i'm like really bored right now that's why i'm like rambling again...:P   know i shld be studying now, but i jux can't bring myself to do it...ARGH !! wish i could kick my own butt. its raining now, i can see the raindrops falling outside my window, beautiful. i can smell rain too, cherie would say its the smell of soil but still i call it the rain smell, its my favourite smell...i'd make it into a fragrance if i could have my way, i'd name it ' Rain' (what else??). i bet it'll smell millions... LOLx   jay chou's 'An Jing' makes a really good accompaniment for the weather now. melancholy with a lil' sense of bittersweet, i kinda like it though. not that this spells me, its just that i like it, its like, i dunno how to put this, but its like someone is like trying to tell me his story, and its a really touching tale. almost worthy of television. despite that, it seems real. almost like he is whispering it in my ear now...     promises made but none held true forever is a wait, an unseen torment for the heart, for the soul  darkness seeps as tears start to fall, faith flutters as the heart struggles to hold   on to the promise, to the dream  such pain, such agony only one would know; one who is waiting, one who is holding on, to the promise made  so long so long ago  such pain and agony,  only one who have lost before they learned to cherish would know such pain and agony, only one in love would know    i'm telling you, i'm not crazy.....serious.

      today's sunday already??? oh dear....that means i'm taking the rest of my papers this week!! yessss.............!!!! finally, the exams are ending, after all the hard work, its all gonna end this week.....woah, cool man!   though the exams are like gonna end soon, i can't help but worry bout the results.... much as i would love to deny it, but results mean a lot to me....its gonna determine the way people look at me and my folks, its gonna determine my future! what the ****... haiz....i guess this life.   when i was younger, i wanted to be a lawyer really bad, i wanted to be an avenger of the victims, i wanted to uphold the law (and join the justice league if i could). but as i grew older, lawyers became distasteful. most lawyers fought for money and not because of the truth. plus, you can never be sure if you are fighting for the right guy or not, and because of that, i gave up on the dream.   now, i wanted to become a doctor instead! lolx! my reasons for the choice was about the same, because i wanted to help people. i still wanna be a doctor now, but it jux seems that being a doctor is no easy job. people look up to you and sometimes expect you to be God. one wrong move or diagnose would mean your whole career is over. all the years in medical school gone to waste........... haiz, no job is an easy job........  till now, i still haven't got a really clear idea of where i wanna be going. i love performing arts and i really wanted to mess around in it, but andi's right. performing arts is tough business, especially in singapore. the arts scene maybe growing but its growing way too slow...! its no help that most singaporeans haven't been exposed to performing arts long enuf for them to realize the emerging protential in it... somehow, people still have this concept that to become a full time artiste means this person's full time dead meat. being an artiste is tough, you would have to be the best to really stand out from the rest of the wannabes out there, and make a name for yourself. arts can be cruel sometimes, it selects the cream of the crop and condemns the rest as sour cream. its a tough business.   have i told you that i'm really into music?? and that i had actually wanted to become a conductor or full time musician when i get my butt out of school? i doubt so, and i'm seriously starting to banish that thot...though i haven't been playing music for a very long time, but wad i'd been through these years, is starting to disillustionise me...... music is dirty business, most of it is politics and more politics. you gotta know all the right people and right connections to get somewhere, otherwise, you might just have to spend the rest of your life proving yourself to people, proving that you are capable. music maybe beautiful, it may mean the world to me but it can never be taken as a core occupation.   music didn't start out this way. it started as an avenue of expresson for people, a form of praise but as humans evolved, music evolved as well. true that no two music can evoke the same kind of emotion in a person as another can, or like shakespear said " if music is love, let music play...". music has played on but it has evolved to become a form of business too. a business that seldom holds much truth and full of cruelty.   whatever.................

      hehe...i'm back, nah, jux for a while only..... i was going through my mailbox and i came across this msg, which i found really touching....i know christmas ain't here yet but no time is too early for christmas, everyday can be a day of giving and sharing, of peace and joy. i hope anyone who comes across this entry will like this christmas story.  remember, all it takes is one small touch to change a person's life forever.....   A Touching Christmas Story On the last day before Christmas, I hurried to go to the supermarket to buy the gifts I didn't manage to buy earlier. When I saw all the people there, I started to complain to myself:  'It is going to take forever here and I still have so many other places to go...'  Christmas really is getting more and more annoying every year. How I wish I could just lie down, go to sleep and only wake up after it. Nonetheless, I made my way to the toy section, and there I started to curse the prices, wondering if kids really play with such expensive toys. While looking in the toy section, I noticed a small boy of about 5 years old, pressing a doll against his chest. He kept on touching the hair of the doll and looked so sad. I wondered who this doll was for.  Then the little boy turned to the old woman next to him: 'Granny, are you sure I don't have enough money?' The old lady replied: 'You know that you don't have enough money to buy this doll, my dear.' Then she asked him to stay here for 5 minutes while she went to look around. She left quickly. The little boy was still holding the doll in his hand. Finally, I started to walk towards him and asked who he wanted to give this doll to. 'It is the doll that my sister loved most and wanted so much for this Christmas. She was so sure that Santa Claus would bring it to her.' I replied to him that maybe Santa Claus will bring it to her, after all, and not to worry. But he replied to me sadly. 'No, Santa  Claus can not bring it to her where she is now. I have to give the doll to my mother so that she can give it to her when she goes there.' His eyes were so sad while saying this.  'My sister has gone to be with God. Daddy say that Mummy will also go to see God very soon, so I thought that she could bring the doll with her to give it to my sister'.   My heart nearly stopped.  The little boy looked up at me and said: 'I told daddy to tell mummy not to go yet. I asked him to wait until I come back from the supermarket' Then he showed me a very nice photo of him where he was laughing. He then told me: 'I also want mummy to take this photo with her so that she will not forget me.'  I love my mummy and I wish she doesn't have to leave me but daddy says that she has to go to be with my little sister' Then he looked again at the doll with sad eyes, very quietly.  I quickly reached for my wallet and took a few notes and said to the boy. 'What if we checked again, just in case if u have enough money?'  'Ok' he said. 'I hope that I have enough.' I added some of my money to his without him seeing and we started to count it. There was enough for the doll, and even some spare money. The little boy said: 'Thank you God for giving me enough money' then he looked at me and added: 'I asked yesterday before I slept for God to make sure I have enough money to buy this doll so that mummy can give it to my sister. He heard me' 'I also wanted to have enough money to buy a white rose for my mummy, but I didn't dare to ask God too much. But He gave me enough to buy the doll and the white rose.'  'You know, my mummy loves white rose'  A few minutes later, the old lady came again and I left with my trolley. I finished my shopping in a totally different state from whenI started. I couldn't get the little boy out of my mind. Then I remembered a local newspaper article 2 days ago, which mentioned of a drunk man in a truck who hit a car where there was one young lady and a little girl. The little girl died right away, and the mother was left in a critical state.The family had to decide whether to pull the plug on the life-assisting machine, because the young lady would not be able to get out of the coma. Was this the family of the little boy?  Two days after this encounter with the little boy, I read in the newspaper that the young lady had passed away.  I couldn't stop myself and went to buy a bunch of white roses and I went to the mortuary where the body of the young woman was exposed for people to see and make last wish before burial. She was there, in her coffin, holding a beautiful white rose in her hand with the photo of the little boy and the doll placed over her chest. I left the place crying, feeling that my life had been  changedforever. The love that this little boy had for his mother and his sister is still, to that day, hard to imagine. And in a fraction of a  second, a drunk man had taken all this away from him.

      Tears of laughter tears of pain tears of terror tears of shock tears of mine flow so free  now why do you?  drops of pearls  and of diamonds  caressing my face   as i bear witness  to birth and to death to joy and to sorrow to love and to heartbreak  tears of mine now why do you fall? i fall for love i fall for sadness i fall for pain i fall for joy more importantly, i fall because of life; i fall for you   you are love, you are joy, you are pain, as well as sadness all rolled into one you live for love and learned pain in return you live for joy  and learned sadness too  when things get in your way you never say no and turn to find shelter when the toughest situations  ascend upon your shoulders you took it in your stride  and made the best of it some where along the way, you've learned to be stronger, smarter you've learned to live, you've learned to just be you; I've learned to just be me and i guess that's all i need to know

      i declare me NUTS ! Y?? Simple, coz I'm like so bored I'm sprouting nonsense online.........muhahaha ! My dad juz said I've grown fat........Man! Maybe its about time i go on a diet?? That would mean I'm gonna be missing out on my favourite foods...! Oh no! To not be able to eat is like the ultimate torture for me.........Especially since I'm a big food fan.  *haiz* wait a minute.....i see a really big irony here. i live in a very comfortable country with plenty to eat, a place where food wastage is like so darn high, and I'm actually complaining about growing fat and going on a diet! geez...! okie, I'm no saint, that i have to admit, but its like...HELLO!  there people starving out there and I'm declining my body of food for vanities sake! Wad on earth is happening here? People refuse food because they wanna look good (model skinny, in other words), not because they wanna be healthy. woah.......wad's going on here? people are starving out there for goodness sake! Some are so poor that they can't afford to feed themselves but fast food restaurants throw away burgers and fries that are perfectly okie to consume just because they have been outside for more than 5 minutes with no one ordering them!   HELLO!?!?! NEED I REMIND U THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE STARVING OUT THERE?? PEOPLE WHO WOULD DOWN EVEN THE MOULDEST BREAD THEY CAN FIND??   wassup with you people? Dun destroy food like that, its worth something to others even if u dun wan it. Kids are suffering from malnutrition and dying slowly and the disease consumes them day by day, poor folks who live on the streets can hardly afford to feed themselves 2 meals a day are also dying from starvation.  true, there are charity food houses around but lookie here! They need money to pull through too! Most people, not all, people i see, would rather spend their money on products to beautify themselves than to contribute it to a better cause....i mean izzit worth it? i believe there are more user-friendly ways to spend money, dun get me wrong, I'm not against pampering our bodies once in a while but to be spending hundreds of dollars on GUCCI and PRADA every other day is way off! I'd rather be giving it to charity.............It'd serve more purpose.   I'm not anti rich or anti pampering, I'm guilty of it myself sometimes. Wad i mean is to know your limits and well, think about the other haf of the world too! i dun expect everyone to be super saints and give everything away in search of the ultimate truth, i doubt I'll be that selfless myself.....Wad really irks me is the fact that there are people out there who believe that anyone who dun own as much or more than them should be condemned and that only they deserve to live in this world coz they are well-to-do............  WHAT THE HELL MAN ?!!

      yoz! Sorry I forgot to update yesterday....Can't really do so too coz of the major headache I've got...haiz. It always happens when I study too much... But well, I dun mind the headache coz I think it was worth it! Yeah! The biology paper was kinda ez today.. WAIT ! I can't say that coz everytime I do, I wan score for that particular paper... :P I'm jinx man......... Anyhow, I'm really in a good mood today cox of bio...haha! Never thot this day would come. Went for lunch for yi chun , Janet and Wendy jux now, oh yah, we saw wen qiang, kel and chin quan too... HI GUYS ! Weird huh ? Its like we're all classmates lor and we're eatin the same stuff but still we chose to sit apart from each other.... Girls one group and guys the other... Weird sia!   back to lunch, pas we were having lunch, Wendy made a comment saying about the exams ending soon, i thot she would like jump at that thot but she didn't....She actually felt sad about it. i thot otherwise at that moment but now, i can feel wad she feels.   its like, wow, we're gonna finish our exams the next week and i dun think we'll be seeing each other as much as we do now and i think I'm gonna miss everyone, even the ones i dun tok to...Its like, I'm already to seeing this faces around me and the thot that i wun be seeing the same faces anymore pretty soon got me both excited and scared. Excited coz i know I've moved on, to meet new people and go new places but I'm also scared coz I'd be all alone.........i wun have my friends to turn to for assurance and courage. I'm gonna have to face all this new stuff myself....The future seems so near yet so far.....Its kinda like having to venture into the Amazon forest alone and finding your own way out again...i welcome the challenge but I'm afraid along the way i might lose myself and my friends...The people who grew up with me this 4 years...i guess one will never know to appreciate until they've lost it, thank God I'm not one of them....  even now, i can still remember the first time i stepped into school as a newbie... lolx i look so standoffish! Man! Like a huge contrast to now,i mean i still look like that when i dun smile lah, but at least now, I'm more sure of myself and I'm like a lot friendlier lor! Dun you guys agree??? lolx :D can still remember the competition between the classes back in lower sec....The cheering competitions, robotics, class presentations and the syf competitions...haiz...All the memories, i believe I'm gonna remember even 10 years down the road! They're jux too good to forget, especially the people i met along the way, good or bad, all made an impact and taught me a lesson. More importantly, are the friends that I've made along the way....I've grown up because of them. I've grown happier and stronger because of them too...  for some reason, i can't help imagining seeing them 10 years later, at a class gathering.........Wad would they have become? Would they still remember me? or each other, how would they have changed?  really, i jux can't help but imagine......................

      Guess wad? I guess to a certain extend all my worries last nite had been to waste! *lolx*  I mean the paper wasn't as hard as I had expected it to be lor, but still I doubt I'll pass. I didn't do the last question plus along the way I had a lot of faults....Hopefully it'll turn out better than I expected. Gonna be taking bio on the 13th, another scary paper... Haven't been very good at bio all along....praying like siao that I wun do too badly for it....need at least a B3 .... *shrugs*  guess this means I wun be sleeping for the next few nights....call me paranoid if you want to but I'm like this only when my results are concerned ok........They mean a lot to me, much as I hate to say this but in this world, what defines you (especially when it comes to job hunting), is still what is written on your report slip. Sad ain't it?? You can be the world's nicest person but without good grades to show, people would still be looking at you with disdain.  *sighzzz........* our reputation lies in the hands of others, much as we hate it but how people look at us matters. Reputation is really something that no one can afford to be fooling around with...........  can you imagine? If one day( dun get offended, it's jux a hypothesis...) someone discovered that Mother Theresa used to work in a carbaret, (forgive me...) as a can can girl, would people still have looked up to her as they had before? Maybe after witnessing her miracles, yes, but before?? No, people would probably be trampling on her and label her a sinner! Yes, such is life, cruel but true.  *sighzz*  wonder why people are more impressed by a Harvard degree than another of  equal standing local university degree? Cause' Harvard is famous for producing good students though not all who come out from there are equally good. When you enter Harvard, you are just paying to graduate with its letterhead, employers are impressed even if your results are mediocre, while another graduate from a local university would have to work doubly hard, score doubly well just to get the same kind of recognition a Harvard graduate have.  *shrugs and shakes head* nothing in this world is fair, guess we'll just have to accept. Only on Judgement Day, will everyone be judged for our deeds and faith. only then, will it really be fair.

      oh my GOd! it has been so long since i last updated my blog!! Argh.....can't blame me though... imagine this, a rather skinny girl having to wrestle her brother, who is roughly 2x her size, every night just to update her blog, by the time she gets it she is like too tired to write ~~lolx   wad ever it is, i'm back and that is all that matters rite?? anywayz, during the period of my absence online, i got my writing mojo back. wrote quite a lot of lame poems but misplaced them ....most of them are really sad though.......... dunno y but i've been kinda down lately. very melancholy, very sombre, very unlike me. its all about dead and lonliness....very sad. that's one of the reason y i refuse to publish them, life is beautiful and bright, ppl have their own problems to handle, shouldn't make life even darker by letting em read my stuff ....  for some reason, i think i'm a very dark person. i can't seem to write about anything happy. i read so of the stuff i wrote some yrs ago....they are so dark they scare me. i think i've got an identity crisis and split personality....haven't been reading the newspaper since i started work. actually haven't been reading anything since i started work... my brain is deterioating... not reading oso has its plus points, at least i wun think so much...lolx contradicting myself...i wanna think or i'll go crazy and become senile but i dun wanna think too much in the process lest' i trouble myself too much over things that aren't to be

      wow! i'm really lagging back on my blogs man...think i really gotta make it a point to come online more often...  anywayz, today is world AIDS day, i've kinda got a thousand and one things going on in my head now. i watched the movie   last night. its actually about the start ad spread of the AIDS virus. i almost cried. the courage that AIDS victims have is incredible, their will to live surpasses many healthy living people. the radio had something on about the story of bobby white too and its really getting me to start thinking about my life. i should be happy, i'm healthy and living well. i've got friends all around me and yet, i complain over the smallest things. i forgot that there are people out there who are more unfortunate than i am.   surprising isn't it? we will never know to appreciate what we have until we lose it. its the same with life, its often when u are about to lose it then will u start to really live it. i pray i'll never make this mistake. darts, i really can't write anymore, i've got so many words swimming around in my head, waiting to be written down but i can't do it. i guess it'll have to wait till tmr, when i'm feeling less sad i guess.     hey, this is to anyone who comes across this blog. pls dun treat AIDS victims like outcasts, some of them are just as innocent as you and me, they deserve as much respect as any other living person. in fact i think they deserve much more respect than what some people are giving them. they have the courage to live on and they believe in life, they never looked down on themselves, it really takes a great deal of courage to do this, give them credit for it.in the main time, pls practice safe sex and keep to one sexual partner only, you are not only doing yourself a big favour, you are also making our world a safer place for children to play and grow up in. AIDS is only spread through sexual intercourse and by blood, its not air borne and its not passed through saliva. today is world AIDS day, do show your support for these victims regardless of colour or race.

      hrm........nothing much on today, or should i say this week. something just entered my mind yesterday, would anyone like another to forget the first? hrm....if so, den wun it be kinda unfair to the later?? in this case y would anyone want to do so? is it better to love or be loved in return? hrm...wad is considered better? it all depends on the person loving u and the one u're loving in return doesn't it?   it differs one from another. if one is to say that loving one is more fortunate then let me put across then. what if the person that u have given u're heart to isn't one who'll reciprocrate ur feelings? then in this case is it still more fortunate to love than to be loved? is all the pain worth it? isn't it better to be placing ur heart into someone else who will appreciate wad u have offered? silly as it may sound, i'd rather love than to be loved. to love another would mean i'm given the choice of whom to choose to love. i'd find it harder to be facing, yes, someone who loves me but isn't someone i love at all. it'll make my life miserable and his, a dillusion. this way, it hurts both parties. if it muz be den i'd rather i be the one to be hurting, hey, at least onli one person needs to suffer rite?    love is best given and received best shared and presented  but alas, love makes us fools too blind to perceive  too blind to judge  love binds but it also breaks one once said love is about sacrifices never about being sorry perhaps its true  a mixture of letting go and holding on a mixture of remembering and forgiving a mixture of laughter and tears a wait, a simple wish, a hope upon a falling star, waiting to come true

      ok, i know i haven't been a good blogger lately. especially with all my missed out entries. i'm kinda sick today so i dun think i have much to write about either, jux wanna post my favourite song up here for all to know, that's all i have in mind i guess.... urgh..........i'm feeling pukey again....        Lover's Concerto     * How gentle is the rain, that falls softly  on the meadow. Birds high up on the trees,  serenade the clouds with their melodies.*   Repeat *   Oh... See there beyond the hills,  the bright colors of the rainbow.  Some magic from above.  Made this day for us, just to fall in love.  You'll hold me in your arms,  and say once again you'll love me.  And that your love is true,  everything will be just as wonderful.   Now, I belong to you,  from this day until forever.  Just love me tenderly and I'll give to you  every part of me.  Oh! Don't ever make me cry,  through long lonely nights without us.  Be always true to me, keep this day  in your heart eternally.  You'll hold me in your arms, and say  once again you love me.  And that your love is true,  everything will be just as wonderful.

        oh yeah! a brand new year, brand new beginnings for all!     while the clock struck 12 midnight, i was talking on the phone with my friend and it was then that i realize how unexcited i am about the upcoming new year. sad case isn't it? it's a brand new year and i'm sulking away about it. didn't even wanna watch the count down show, it seemed like a facade. everyday can be a new year if u want it to be, why bother making this one day so different from the rest? wun it be better if we took everyday to be a brand new year, brand new beginnings for all??   forgive me, that was the sour me talking. new year day came and passed just like that. so quickly and so swiftly...dunno what to make of it too. forget it....  anyway, back to last nite. i was just sitting around doing nothing after i hung up so i decided to do a  'NEW YEAR DAY REFLECTION' , to which i found really surprising coming from me. i hate doing reflections, it makes me look bad and reminds me of the bad stuff that happened and my failures. nevertheless, i still did it and i'm glad i did. it gave me time to think about my life, where i wanna be heading in future and what i wanna do in future. although it was a lil' sour going through my mistakes and faults, i had fun poking fun at myself and i've decided that i'll start off my new year on a fun and happy note rather than a sour one. so here goes, my new year reflection....  year 2003 had been a rather frightful year, especially with the O levels and all but i muz say i had fun and enjoyed it too. first up, 2003 taught me the value of time and the value of friends and that it was alright to be vulnerable sometimes. throughout the whole of last year, there were a lot of times where i couldn't possibly have gone on if i hadn't got my friends with me. to lend me their shoulders when i get too burdened by my surroundings and an out reached hand, ready to pull me up wheni fall. i also learnt the meaning of value for money, or in this case, value for time. after all the freaking effort i've put into my band, we finally managed to get a medal. it wasn't wad i had wanted but it was wad i had expected. we could have done better most definately, but i guess to a certain extend it was good enuf that we got a medal. mayb i should learnt o be less demanding and less of a perfectionist...haha, i'm pretty sure many people will agree with this statement. i'm a very demanding perfectionist, not a total perfectionist but yeah, still one. i'm pretty sure it'll make a lot of people's lives easier. didn't spend enough time studying last year, so i dun think i'm gonna do very well for my Os...promise that i'll work like shit next year once i get into the sch of my choice, which is most probably gonna be a poly. i'm gonna do mass communications or business. i so promise to work my butt off to make it to the top and get into the uni.   the 2nd saddest thing about 2003 is that i still failed to get a boyfriend...*sobz..* yeah, sad rite?! haiz...think its got something to do with the way i look...especially when i dun smile. the feedback i get is that i look too proud and stand offish...! *sobz* not my fault, really. i just happen to not like smiling a lot, that's all. never mind, resolution no.4, smile more for this year! =) i've got to learn to be more open and friendly lah....otherwise i doubt i'll ever get a boyfriend..(wahahahaha!!) =) ok, i'm smiling more this year... not onli so, i gotta learn to be more open with my thoughts and feelings too!! andi is right, i built a wall around myself to keep myself from being hurt by people, but its also preventing people from knowing me and me from knowing them. so yeah, its time for the wall to go...can't break it down all at once, but i can try slowly...hey, they didn't break the Berlin Wall down in one night you know? ok, mayb they did but it was also after much struggle and much lost that the wall finally came down,so yeah...i'm picking it up soon. its not gonna be easy but i'm sure i'll make it. hey girl! have confidence in urself! another thing that i wanna do is to fulfill my wish to tour!! yeah! talked to kim hock last night, we gonna go tour malaysia next june...before poly starts...! wahahaha....mayb go look for more people to go also, more fun mah. although touring malaysia is like no biggie but it is already a big step for me...gotta take things easy remember? relax a lil' and be less demanding. i'll start with malaysia then then next year thailand, then china, then taiwan, then the world!! haha...nah, my no. XX resolution for the year, travel more. yeah, gonna try and save as much as i can then go travel every year... haha! yeah, travel every year. not the package tours that like cost a bomb lah, i'll go free and easy, go back packing... ;) sounds like fun right?? yeah, it has been a long tern dream of mine already, but i was too young before so i couldn't fulfill it, but now, i'm 16 going on 17, i think my folks trust me well enough to travel on my own... resolution no. XX+1, get a digital camera before i go travelling, one with all the works and stuff. i wanna go take pictures of the places i've visited, enlarge my photo collection. most the shots i've taken so far are all centralised in singapore. i call them the  'Images Of Singapore Through My Lens'   next up, gonna enlarge the collection and call it,  'The World Through My Eyes'  haha...i know the name is a lil' cliche but i like it, too bad.   Resolution no. (XX+1)+1, i'll be less stubborn and be a lil' more tactful... lolx =D kinda hard la, but i can always try can't i? hrm, think its about time i curb my stubbornness...it can cause quite a lot of trouble sometimes...and being a lil' more tactful would most definately help in everyday life too. hiya, in short, i wish to be a better person for this year la! i'll learn to appreciate the lil' things in life and learnt to love life more with each passing day. people come and people go, instead of feeling bitter, i'll learn to be thankful for the things that they have brought into my life and the lessons that they have taught me so well. for this new year, i'll learn to love the Arts more, any aspect of it. =) a few black sheeps aren't worth sacrificing my love for the Arts. let it be music, dance or stage, they are all different people's ways of expressing themselves. i guess the Arts is the freedom of expression of the individual. i'll learn to appreciate that expression and love that freedom.   ok, think i'll just stop here...my reflection is getting to be really long. lolx  =D think this is gonna be a pretty good year ahead so,  HAPPY NEW YEAR blog!

       Love,  a word of trust and hope that binds two souls as one  Love, a word misused, misplaced tears apart a person from within  It turns you inside out with the rawest emotions  of the soul within   It twists and turns  and blows you away  and out of sight  But yet, nothing pleases more than a lover's smile on you or the other   Ironies of life yet truth of love makes one happy to see the other so

      haven't blogged for so long, i almost forgot the address for the homepage......how lame is that?? anywayz, i just found out not too long ago that actually ky shares my sexual identity (woah!!) but he's in a much worse predicament than i'm in. i'm happily attached to a guy who loves me and whom i love very much dearly too but in ky's case, this might neva happen to him. i have no idea how i would handle it if i were him. it'll probably kill me....( it might, i've already had a hard time hiding my feelings for my dear...) imagine his agony!!   for some reason, i can't help but feel like splitting the truth to XX but i know if i do that its a betrayal of trust between two friends....it wun be fair to ky either. think i shld juz let things take shape themselves.....its not within my control neither shld it be........he's probably going thru wad i went thru except its 2x worse. feel like kicking myself in the butt. it feels like i'm not really doing enuf to help him. wish i could share his agony and pain so that it'll be less horrible on him.... Hey, if u're reading this blog, i just wanna tell u that my phone is on 24/7, just drop me a msg or line whenever u feel like u need someone to scream out to alright?? love ya, and dun think too much ok?

      hrm...I'm bored. Yup,you got that right, I'm bored. I jux realize I've got a very passionate boyfriend, passionate about music that is. Once he starts playing he practically forgets the whole world except his music. Sometimes  I really can't help but wonder if this is a good thing or a bad thing. Well, no matter wad, I love him still. I guess this was why I was attracted to him on the first place, his passion for much and the way he interprets it is really beautiful, he's got a beautiful mind although it gets a little crowd at times and I can't read into it but still I think its beautiful... =)oh man, I miss him........  anyway, enough of him. I was reading this book on Chinese history just a while ago before I came online(the translated and shortened version that is...)and sad as this is gonna sound. I found it rather absurd, the Confucius part that is. I mean I'm a history student by choice and I love reading up about it. I haven't studied history in depth (well, they dun offer it to poly students...)but I did do it for 4 years and I'm a pretty good history student(I think...). I've read about historical events of the world since I'm in primary school man! History is the story about dead people but it is also a lesson learned and trialed by time. Well, I'm moving away from wad I wanted to start tying about about in the first place so, uh hrm, I'm back.   as I was saying, I was reading up about the history of china from the beginning to the three kingdoms. I gotta say, I found it very interesting except for the part that Confucius had in the place of Chinese history. China's history is the history of the world. Its dynasty rises and falls and it has gone through more battles and treachery than most of the western countries have gone through or encountered, I can proudly say, I'm proud of the rich history I have as a Chinese but the part where Confucius came in really sucked man! He set up some rules and protocols governing the way of life of the people that (I believe anyway...) totally made life unbearable. What Confucius had in china was what Stalin had created for Lenin, a cult culture. Thankfully he didn't do it on purpose or for his own gain or the consequences would have been unthinkable...But still, oh gosh! Emperors followed his ideas blindly and so fervently that the absurdity and stupidity of the whole idea simply astonished me. A lot of Confucius ideas were on the individual's role and responsibility in society. Men are suppose to work and support the family while the wives stay at home and have no life of their own. Their whole life is dedicated to their parents, siblings, husband then children. She had no life of her own, her whole life revolved around others. Their male counterparts role is about the same except that he had to provide for the family as well and more emphasis was placed on filial piety. There was an incident cited in the book that really struck me. a soldier deserted his camp 3 times so that he could go home to look after his father was praised by his officials for his filial piety while the others that died in his place received none of that. Now, imagine this, what if half of the active serving troops decide to desert camp for the same reason? Who the hell would be left to fight the ongoing war? If there aren't enough people serving in the frontlines, everyone else back home would probably get slaughtered after the invasion and life of a thousand would be lost because of these 'filial' sons, what good is filial piety if you're probably gonna die for it? And need I remind you, this happened during the Spring and Autumn period. It was a time of war and turbulence. Can u imagine if that is to be applied into today's life? =S   sadly, I can't totally disagree with Confucius. His ideas formed the very basis of the Chinese lifestyle and beliefs. Without him, I(we) probably won't be what we are today. His ideas suited the people and leaders then. It was something different and most importantly, it gave them a sense of direction and purpose. When war has ended, soldiers had have nothing more to look out for, families have nothing to fear or worry about anymore, not that people especially loved war and unrest, everybody looks forward to peace and prosperity but when one suddenly has nothing to think or worry about, life suddenly becomes aimless. Confucius ideas were the basic building blocks of many dynasties. It gave the rulers and the people something to work on and believe in rather than have to start everything right from scratch. Its not that easy. One's culture and beliefs takes time to form, like civilisations but dynasties some and go, they fall and they rise again. They get replaced by something else more sophisticated each time before time catches up and modernisation takes place, replacing dynasties with communism, socialism, capitalism so on and so forth. But if u'd look back carefully, maybe you'd realize what we have today was built on what was lost yesterday. The very basis of our ways of governing, yes is more up to date and more humane but if you take away the modern terms and facades, one might find himself/herself face to face with a method or way of government that has existed way before the word democracy even came about.   I guess what I'm trying to put across here is that to some people, history is just the study of events and people(mostly dead) of the past. It holds no link or reference to the modern world we live in, therefore a useless subject(as some of my friends and relatives have said..." might as well study geography! More use !") but don't forget, if not for yesterday, there might be no tomorrow, don't take your own history for granted, you are what you are today because of what happened yesterday.

      i'm worried about wendy. she's entering depression again and its not good... feels like me all over again and i feel so helpless because i can't help her. i know myself, i know i've got a slight case of depression but i have Mun to be there for me, i can tell him anything and i'm stronger, i can mentally convince myself that things are gonna be ok but she can't. she's really not as strong as everybody thinks. people tend to make wendy out to be some kinda wonderwoman, the kind that nothing can get her down. its onli when u see her in her weakest moments that u'll know she's not that strong, she's actually pretty fragile. i promised her mom to look after her, make sure she eats and dun do anything silly but right now at this moment i dunno wad to do! ARGH !!!! its frustrating u know? i want so DARN MUCH to help her but its almost like the more i reach out the more she runs back into her shelter, worse still, this shelter isn't a very strong one lo.... how?? can anyone tell me how? i'm really worried lei...she smiles but inside its killing her to do so but she puts up this front so that people won't worry what she don't know is that is makes us worry more........not that alot of people know abt though. how?????

      Yes! I'm here to fufill my vow of updating my blog more frequently... Dunno how long I can keep this up though...Ha. Anyway, nothing much happened today. In fact, it was so boring I thought I could die! Argh...I simply surprised myself by not going out today (a first in many days...) this came about really, as an incredible feat especially if you know me. I'm the kinda person who can hardly keep still and yet I managed to force myself to sit infront of the computer rather than pick up my bag and go out. Yes, my day was simply spent in front of the computer, at home. WOW! Oh man, one more day like this and I think I'm gonna die! ArGh....  But I guess its worth it, provided my videos finish downloading by tmr that is. Otherwise I think I just might go nuts. Yes, I spent the whole day downloading songs that I thought of using for my auditions for the Singapore Idol thingy...Ha! Yup, I signed up for the competition. Hey, I know that there is this terribly high chance that I might jux be the next William Hung but WHO CARES! I mean look at it this way, its a once in a lifetime thingy man! I know I'm never gonna get the chance to do it again if I missed this chance. Who the heck would want an 80 year old granny as their Singapore Idol?? Yeah, its that kinda thing u know. To do it once and get over it, so that you wun have any regrets later on in life. Who knows? Maybe there ARE people who are totally tone deaf but are having the Idol dream? As pit against them I'm pretty sure I'll fare well lo...I'm actually a pretty good singer depending on my mood that is. Who knows? There are a thousand and one possibilities to a single situation, so y not just give it a try? Even if I do end up in the blobbers segment, I would rest in peace knowing that I've done my best AMEN! I guess I'll survive just fine, I mean what's there to fear? I know I'm gonna have Wendy there to support me (oh yeah, she's taking part too!! YEAH!!) and a whole bunch of pals at home waving their pom-poms, drumming up a song of victory and courage for the both of us so yeah, I think we're gonna do just fine if u know what I mean...  My Simpson fever has just reached a new height upon the discovery of the Simpson video online and as I'm typing this entry, my computer is busily trying to cope with the amount of Simpson video I've lined up to be downloaded. Its really quite scary judging by the number of remotely queued videos I've got but hey, how often is it that I would actually sit down and do this? Once in a blue moon lo...Its not that often that my boyfriend falls sick and I've got no one to hang out with...OOPS! Did I let the cat of the bag?? Hehe....Ok ok, maybe I had an ulterior motive for staying at home but the thing that really matters here is still that I stayed at home rite? I'm not the bad girl that everyone makes me out to be, I can be homely and stay at home too wad....hehe I'm starting to get bored, none of the videos wish to finish downloading...which translate to mean I'm probably not gonna get to watch them tonite. Oh yeah, did i mention i'm also downloading some episodes of the Charmed series? Yeah, so Kel? If u want them jux let me know and i'll send it over... Oh ya, i finally found The Nightmare Before Christmas too! But i'm not too sure if its gonna be the full movie or not. if its the full movie, i'm so gonna ask wendy to burn it for me man! i've looked all over Singapore for a copy of it but yes, to no avail. They've onli got it on DVD(i dun have a player at home tat supposrts it) but its all sold out lor! Or i would have bought it and dropped by my friend's place to watch it... ArGh.... Hrm...i think that's enuf grumbling for a day besides, i wanna go watch Jurassic Park le. So here's to u blog, GOOD NITE AND GOOD BYE!

      alot of stuff happened since i last entered my blog entry. well, one thing that i'm most happy about is that my boyfriend's back!! haha...i'm like 10 thousand times happier now than before. one thing that i've learnt from all this is that i'm not good at communicating and that i'm too insecure. i keep too many things to myself and in process i make the life of those who care pretty hard. and more than often, its because of the failure to communicate that relationships fall apart. mine was slightly different though. mine was a combination of both i guess. i keep alot of things to myself, its not that i dun wanna tell people about it, its jux that i dunno how to say it. everytime something happens the first person i think of is Mun, there are so many things i wanna say and do with him but it seems that when i see him, i dunno where to start and in the end i just give up. i'll just forget about it. no, forgetting isn't the word to use, i'm just putting them aside for the time being before it resurfaces. it seems that it hurts to not be able to share the problems and happiness of the ones u love. i realize how much i've hurt the very people who love me the most.

      3 days has passed since my break up. i guess somehow i'm slowly starting to come out of the self denial mode and into accepting reality. its not easy i guess....but i'll survive..=) somehow i know i will. i juz finished writing him a 3 page long letter...dunno if i'll have the courage to send it out even as i'm blogging now, i'm thinking about the letter. do you think he'll reply?? i really can't bring myself to think anymore, i'm so tired...i imagine it'll be worse for him. i betrayed him in the first place sia...but it was a moment of impluse thingy...i did regret it after it happened. nah, i'm not gonna go there again...finally got out of it, i dun wanna go back again. i've decided to write him a letter everyday juz to fill him in on my life, you may say its useless of that i'm being extremely selfish here but i have to. its the onli way i think i'll ever recover.... i know this is gonna sound evil but i imagined that his pig would be most happy bout this...she might feel for him la, but she'd probably be glad i'm out of his life den she can come in...ha! evil thot right?? i thot so too....but i can't help it. i'm in the evil mode right now.... know wad??? after all that happened, i realized how much i love him actually. i mean, he's told me about wanting to leave to further his learning overseas so i guessed as much that mayb one day he'll leave me but all this came too soon....reality is starting to sink in but i'm really not mentally prepared for it yet... i love him, i always thot that if one day he shld leave me, i'll be able to let hi go graciously but now i know i can't....i really can't.

      I haven't been the mood to write anything for days already, I lost my love again. =) I guess after 1 whole week of mourning, I'll be fine la...I'll cry a lil' while more but after the crying, I'm sure I'll recover. I don't think I'll ever love anyone as much ever again, no matter how hard I try. I'll always love Mun. He's the first pity he couldn't be the last...But he'll be the last person to ever make me cry this much ever again.... =) I'll be fine!  well, let's see...Orientation ended last nite with a bang man! There was a lot of dancing, especially in my part. haha. I was on the  dane floor almost all the time and yeah, I was wild man! haha... I guess I was dancing to get Mun off my mind...It really helps u know? To get ur body in this really super hyper and tired state then things seem to become so much simpler. so i did, i got myself totally soaked and tired out, actually all 3 days of orientation had been totally tiring but i guess it was fun la...i got tot know my class mates lo..haha. not all of them i like though...i don't like nicole and desmond for starters. they both got attitude sia! nicole has this unbearable air around her that really makes her irritating. her refusal to participate in the activities din help either, she's always so bz clicking away on her mobile and well, just irritating lo! =S desmond wasn't any better, he's very rude and totally no respect for the rest of the class. he doesn't help out during activities either and well, like nicole just plain attitude and irritating!! well, whatever lo. dun step on my toes or i'll make sure u regret ever knowing me lo. when i bitch, i'll go all out one so dun start me.

      He...Just realize I haven't been updating my blog again lately... So I guess I'm back!   well, a lot of things happened this few weeks that I was away from my blog, so much that I dun really know where to start blogging about. First up, to everyone who have been messaging me but not receiving a reply, I'm really sorry guys, my phoneline got cut. Guess my dad failed to pay his part of the bill again...Well, wad to do? Anyway, where did I stop the last time? The Singapore idol part rite? Yeah, I think so. Well, lets see...I finally got in touch with this primary school friend of mine after a really long time. She's currently in India, waiting to do her A' levels. Her birthday's on the 4th of July(I almost forgot about that..) and yeah, I received her email last night and I managed to pull my fingers to work and typed her a pretty long mail updating her on my current happenings for the past 3 months?? hahaha...Not an easy task I tell you... I haven't seen mum in a week already and I miss him so badly but no matter how bad I know its probably never gonna be as bad as how much wendy's missing kailun.     I HATE tHAT GUY!!!    he went to cathay when Wendy was working with this dumb bitch lor and I guess it really got on wendy's nerves. She broke down and called me(I was sleeping at that moment...)and started sobbing. I mean, fuck him la! I really didn't have a bloody clue as in to what she wants me to do lor. He's a fucking asshole and she knows that, we(kel and I) warned her about him and giving him another chance again but she didn't quite register our words and now this. What do you want me to do? No, put it this way, what the fucking hell can I do? I wanna kick his ass lor but I'm not there and he's probably not worth the effort. Who would be happy to hear something like that happen? Especially when you've already predicted the ending but no one gave a damn about it. So fine, I let you go ahead and do what you think is right and best for you. Hey, its your life man! I'm in no control of it, I dun want to be. So yeah, I let her go do what she wants and when she got hurt she came back to me, I didn't mind that part seriously, I dun mind that at all. She's almost like a sister to me, I'll die for her if I had to but what can I do? I'm at home, she's at work, crying for some asshole that nobody really likes. Worse still, why is she crying? cause'he went to the movies with a pretty girl. Well, told you it was gonna happen. Been there, done that. Then what happen, she said she tink she called the wrong person, I got admit, I didn't sound like I cared but you know what? You needed to talk so I let you, what am I to do? I can feel this thing boiling inside of me, if I actually spoke more than what I did that day I'd probably end up scolding her and when I say scold I really mean it. Its probably gonna make her feel 10x worse lor, so why bother? Lets just say I'm not exactly the best kinda friend you'd wanna have lo. In fact, I think I'm a lousy person altogether. I believe in letting people do what they wanna do and hopefully they'll learn their lesson from there.    give a man a fish, it'll feed him for a day.  teach a man to fish, it'll feed him a lifetime.   so yeah, that's what I did but more than often I get blamed for allowing things to happen although I knew it was gonna happen. I get blamed for leaving people in the lurch and not being the sympathic friend. Well, guess what? Its ok, I'm used to it! Blame me for all the fucking problems you have, for not being understanding, for not knowing sympathy etc etc etc...I'm used to it. I'm fine with it. I live my whole darn fucking life for others. I've lived my whole life trying to be what others want me to be but know what? I never quite make the cut. I love my friends, I'd make myself look bad if it makes them look or feel good but you know what? Its still not quite good enough. I dunno what else to do...or maybe I should just stop doing anything, I should just stop trying, I know its definitely gonna make my life a lot easier...

        i haven't felt so betrayed in my whole life before!&nbsp; i swear, i'm never gonna trust guys again. i really never expected him to say something like tat lo. i mean, why do u even bother to put up such a front? why r u so fake? i know i'm a flirt sometimes but i know i'm not that desperate. it is my life motto, the absolute commandment in my life, to never flirt with someone who is attached, they r like the no. 1 turn off list lor...why? how can someone do that? i'm like so hurt and put off by it now that i dun really know how to react or think anymore. i guess i was right all along. guys are onli good enuf to be friends and nothing more than that. i made that mistake before and i can't believe i'm doing it again....am i dumb or what? i told myself before that guys; especially cute guys; are onli good for looking and being friends with but it seems that i've eaten my words and commited that mistake....dumb bimbo.&nbsp; thankfully, i didn't fall for him yet...i'll still be able to salvage myself...        &nbsp;   i'm gonna declare my latest life philosophy here and now:        &nbsp;   love is only a game meant for fools. its a game actually, a game that you will lose more than you win. to avoid getting hurt is to not attach yourself emotionally to anything or anyone, take things as they come and if it is to go, look else where. in this little game called love, to me that is, is all about winning ang pulling out when u know that u're about to lose so that even if you lose, you won't lose too badly. guys are onli good for looking and being friends. flirt with them if you want but never,NEVER TRUST THEM WITH UR HEART  ESPECIALLY CUTE GUYS...

      ihaven't felt so tired in a very long time already. i dunno why i'm feeling this way though, guess its because i didn't sleep last night. yeah, i only slept at 5 in the morning, spent the whole night thinking about Mun. i kept thinking about him these few days, everytime i think of him i'll cry. i'll feel so exhausted everytime i cry but i can't help it though, they just flow. i'm tired lei...really tired but somehow i dun wanna give him up. it seems that everything reminds me so much of him. the streets, the people, the places...everything. i'm tired...really tired.
