      CHANGES ( BY 3 DOORS DOWN ) 
Im not supposed to be scared of anything /But I dont know where I am 
I wish that I could move but Im exhausted /And nobody understands ( how I feel ) /Im trying hard to breathe now/ But theres no air in my lungs/Theres noone to talk to/ And the pain inside is making me numb/Try to hold this under control/You cant help me because noone knows/Now Im going thru changes,, changes/God I feel so frustrated /When I get suffocated save me
Now Im going thru changes,, changes/Feelin weak and weary/ Walkin thru this world alone/ Everything they say, every word of it/Cuts me to the bone ( and I bleed )/Ive got something to say/ But now Ive got nowhere to turn/
It feels like Ive been buried/Underneath the weight of the world/I try to hold this under control......

and thus the song repeats it self for the most part .I love the music of 3 Doors Down. I remeber one nite ( while i was flying high ) I was working in the biggest strip club in the city on a saturday nite at midnight . I was on stage in a showclub dress ( sexy ) with a thong that barely covered all the appropriate places & 8 inch heels ( i love platforms , the bigger the better )
I was on stage under a bright spotlight in the middle of the club high above all the partiers , socialites  , couples exploring their sexuality and whatnot of other onlookers. The club was packed so full that there was no longer standing room only , I remembered excitement and fear of hearing my name called from the dj booth that I was up now to strip off this $200.00 show girl dress which would soon be laying on the floor crumpled into a mess. ( just like me ) I was beyond being capable of getting up from my table of who I cant say ( I protect thier names ) & actually walking up those stage slippery steps & onto an even slicker ( oil from previous dancers ) stage & attempting to look sexy & coherent . I managed amazingly to do so & feeling quit accomplished with that , proceeded to strip for 2songs in front of more than 200 ppl. I literally felt time stand still and the room go in slow motion or my brain that is . I remember the looks on all the faces & the drunken smiles & laughter .  I also remember thinking " what the hell am I doing ?" " who am i ? " had i really come so far that I had actually in my life managed to go backwards .. was this it ? was this what i was ? AND what was I ? ,,, a fading object of sexiness til the next dancer held my hand and walked me off stage , as we all did when it was our turn. I used to think  thank god that I lived in the VIP room & could avoid the stage when my friend would come in a few times a week to see my girlfriend and I whom I miss dearly. ( she still dances ) and of course a dancer doesnt have time for a non-dancer. ( plus we keep different schedules ) I must be addicted to the sexiness of it all, and well the drugs too which is exactly why I dont do them....... I refuse to give away or sell all my dancer costumes - I like to look at them - SEE that is the exact type of thinking that I need to steer clear of.  I am a battle with myself. BEING ME SUX. I remember woman talking to me while I stripped about wanting and having the courage to do it themselves. COURAGE didnt make me strip , survivng made me strip, the fear of no money and being broke and homeless made me strip & with money YOU can look real good & make more money .. sorry but its true. Its amazing what money can do , if you use it right. What noone seems to get in the war of good and evil is that evil money doesnt last and no good money is invested from it. I knew one girl who escorted and prostituted on the side(whatever you want to call it ) AND she made tons of money BUT i always thought when she found the love of her life, would he accept her after she had been with so many other men ? Would he think her to be of any quality ? or just another splunker ( splunking). The money she made and had I did not envy( my imagination runs wild with  the idea of what she must of gone thru to earn it ) .....and well i shudder. SO i ask is there any "just sexy" for hire...... I think that is what got me in all this trouble to begin with, I used to tell my guy while i got ready for work - "i just wish we were amazingly rich and didnt have to work & everyday I could dress up like this just for you." ............ he said "me too, baby ,, me too " When our relationship was young and fresh and new we used to dance for each other and seduce each other AND it was awesome..................Now we get off on watching each other eat diet food and laughing at comedy. What a simple kinda ppl we are HAHA.....i still have all those lustful thoughts though,, dang.....what am i gonna do with them ?

      Here I am back at 1 of my favorite spots, right in front of my computer. I have been spending so much time here that I actually had to cut myself off from it so I could get stuff done. I need a computer job that I would actually enjoy, not like my previous AT&T job.  I cooked dinner ( which is still cooking) and its one of those long preperation type dinners where I slow cooked and seasoned everything just perfect , can we all say YUM! Im on the protien diet so I have no choice but to spice it up ALOT. I also realize when I stay on this diet which is a lifestyle by the way that I am required to cook alot & prepare alot ahead of time for my protien snacking enjoyment, chicken , hard boiled egg whites ETC. It is a good thing I never get sick of this type of food. I live for healthy food. I actually feel the difference when I eat it. OKAY now onto the lustful thoughts part :Being what I will call Christian now, which Im afraid I will never do a good enuff job of, I wonder how do I stop the lustful thoughts. I am amazed that Jesus  never  had one,, COME ON hes a MAN. I have them all day long, so what the heck is wrong with me . I told my guy today that I wanted to sip wine & cook dinner together REAL SLOW, like really get into it & make a feast. Its his day off BUT he didnt do that, only I did. We were grocery shopping & he said if the kids werent here right now I would throw you down & have my way with you( i told him this while we were at the store). SO the concept must of turned him on also. He works so much we never get to do anything together. Im a homebody now til we get another car or the weather looks up enuff for him to ride his motorcycle to work every day. I spend alot of time THINKING. Next year I will have a more normal life ,being able to go to the gym daily like I did a few months ago & being able to do whatever I want , which includes work. I dont know what I want to do SINCE I wont allow myself to dance.  I have lustful thoughts alot, and well I really dont know what to do with them & its not like they are all about my guy but more like concepts of sexiness. Isnt that odd. Im a simple girl , doesnt take alot to make me happy & I have lustful thoughts about mundane silly stuff.

      (well previous link i posted doesnt work - so scratch scratch that...)!!!!!!
Yesterday I was reminiscing of when I lived in AZ and hung out with the
band "BLack Eyed Susan."  I actually met the "Gin Blossoms" because the lead singer of "BES" commited suicide and we were at  the funeral. I remember what an odd looking bunch we were then , all dressed in black  a bunch of long hairs & we thought we were cool (HAHA) anyways,, we ended up going to the Gin Blossom house in Tempe,Az and sat around  & listened to the the band members play some music. I also thought to myself at the time what a bunch of losers they were & how they would never make it ( just from the look of their home).  BUT I was wrong AND what a good thing also. My  freind Rebecca was in love with the lead singer of the "Gin Blossoms" the original one who ended up also shortly after killing himself as well... strange days  those were then ....then sometime after that Rebecca  worked at the radio station & called me one night to come meet her for drinks at a hotel,, well I ended up meeting Paul Westerberg from "The Replacements" & Joan Jett was there too.  We went out for drinks at a local club & drove around looking for an underground party that was over. What a lame night that was BUT I  did end up meeting "Flesh for LULU" from them and escorting them to their show one nite while my friend Susan fell in love over nite with one of the band members- and still some more strange days,,,, AND the saddest part was a I had a light green volkswagon rabbit & we all piled into it.. WEIRD.  That seems like so long ago ! HHHHHHMMMMMMM come to think of it - I have a letter here somewhere from  paul,, wonder what i did with it ? Does anyone remember the band "Tommy Conwell & the Young Rumblers " well I  thought I was in love  with Christopher Day. They played in AZ & my girlfriend & I hung out with them and I thought" for sure he will call me ."(HAHAHA) I also remember that same week a corvette smashed into my car while her & I were sitting at a light waiting for the light to change at thier hotel intersection & then  the corvette proceeded to leave us there as they managed to  speed off ,,, amazing I walked away from that. 
My little car was still running and the keys were knocked out of the ignition , I was so out of it from the impact I couldnt figure out why a passer by wanted to know if I had any beer on me ! I thought geesh I was just in an accident DUDE ! I didnt realize til later they were trying to help us.
I have these small brushes with fame for no reason, Im noone famous ,,, 
I always seem to meet famous ppl no matter where I am but they are small fleeting moments which dont do anything for me, IT is just odd. LIKE I was supposed to be famous but missed my path along the way. I was almost an XFL cheerleader too and the XFL almost became something too, NOT! (I would of been out of work real quick) PLUS I said forget it when I found out they only made $900.00 a month,I used to make over that a nite.... 
In later years I was on Playboy.com with a band & I was paid a whopping
$25.00 for that shoot (HAHA) my girlfriend & I didnt even bother to cash our huge checks, GEESH what would we spend all that money on ? That was my "Poison"moment. We were supposed to originally dance for "Faster Pussycat" & I was so excited to do that having listened to them in high school & shortly after  and loving their music. BUT NO ,, we danced for Poison onstage, which was a thrill still . Nothing like getting up in front of 
16,000 PPL & saying here I am a stripper woo hoo. J/K!! And just a little note for all those women out there that love Bret Micheals , I have to tell you he has the littlest butt I have ever seen in my whole life ( clothed of course ) , I could fit his whole butt in my two hands ( HEHEHE) I like a man with some meat on his bones like hmmm "The Rock". Of course my man
isnt so bad he is "Mr Nude North America" for 1998 and 2000. He wanted to go this year and have me enter as well, but I dont think that would go so well with my being saved and all. I would be the only christian contestant. (HAHAHA) . The pull of being in the limelight is definately addicting  BUT it must all be done in good taste. Ron Jeremy mentioned to my guy working in the porm industry and I must say Im really glad he never did. He once told me he would if only he could be with me only.of course im sure it doesnt work that way... .. I must admit we thought about that one for awhile.. BUT we never did. 
I have so many little dumb moments like this I could log but Im boreing myself now !

      best said by Joyce Meyers :
the mindset we need to get this is :
"okay God, I've come to the end of myself. I've tried this and I've tried that 
I've tried everything I can possibly think of for all of these years. Now it has become obvious that I cant pull this off by myself. God I need you. Only you can do it, so I'm waiting on you." " you may have tried everything and decided that nothing was going to work, then grown depressed and despondant in the situation. You may have developed a bad attitude along the way and began to crab and complain and make everybody including your self miserable because you did everything that YOU could think of and still it didnt look to you as though god was working. The reality is that he never asked you to do anything to begin with, you did those things on your own. You started sounding like you deserved some big reward for all the things that you put yourself through." god brings you to the end of yourself so the gets all the glory and only he can be responsible for your reward and the changes he makes in and around you. That way noone else can claim the credit for what he has done , BECAUSE only a miracle could of allowed for it 
That is pretty much the way i was saved........ So i will patiently sit here and wait for my next step which brings tears to my eyes because i have lived in pain for so long and just dont feel i can carry the burden to be burdened by this situation anymore. I can only pray to god and wait, maybe he wants me to stay and maybe he doesnt BUT he will LET me know his decision. THAT i can trust in. Jesus suffered for us, so what is my suffering compared to his?
not much i would say.... ( more blog later )

      Last nite i prayed to god, to take my burden of lately drinking,,
I have been relying on wine to make my happy and sleepy , Im going thru some relationship stress. Im amazed sometimes at how fast he works because today my desire is gone AND i love that ! So instead of waiting til next month which is what i thought more realistically it would take , i get today to start. I do feel stronger and empowered . I woke up at 300am & upset w/my situation decided worst case scenerio I would only move with what I really loved ( material items ) & the rest could stay - buying new eventually would be something exciting to do later. I would rather live simply & empty ( furniture wise ) than be mentally tormented each day as i am, god does not give us a spirit of fear and torment , someone else does & sometimes it seems i have to really remember so much in the bible that i do not remember because i get so frustrated with my out of control life ( my boyfreind ) . I have to remember to give this burden to god & that he is always working behind the scenes where i cant see, setting things up either for me to prosper or me to move but I will know,, and think i think did i reap this upon myself , no some of these things i did not reap. My boyfreind has a spirit of addcition which makes him verbally abusive & aloof & lazy & non existent, it is very hard to watch an intelligent  man waste his life, so that is where im at, 5 years wasted of my life hoping that growing up in him would occur. I dont know how many more years i want to give him. I will be 35 & so is he. decisions, decisions, decisions... ok more later

      If you look for me
you wont need a special star
im no longer just in bethlehem
im right there where you are
you may not be aware of me
amid your celebrations

and all the landscape decorations
but if you take a moment
from your list of things to do
and listen to your heart ,you'll find
im waiting there for you
your're the i want to be with 
your're the reason i cam 
and you'll find me in the stillness
as im whispering your name
love jesus

All they gave me was a ticket to heaven ... 
but that ticket to heaven said to lie in the bed that you make

      First off, hope the whole gay blog didnt offend anyone, its just this,,,, If everyone was gay - we would be extinct  .  Think about it. 
okay new topic : I used to have amazing thick dark hair & one day I wasnt feeling sexy or cute CUZ my hair was so long & thick & out of control SO i got this wild idea since it was so thick, to bleach it blonde,, dumb dumb dumb, I dont even like blonde hair on me. SO yeah i ruined my hair. I hate my hair now, all i know is thank god hair grows cuz mines fried. I have been trying to save a lost cause with it, it is getting a little shorter each day. I used to want to cut my hair short & have it really dark , well now i may get my chance , thank god i have a hot neck and back, AND hey i can say that cant i ? At least i like something about myself. HEHE.  so my hair was down to the middle of my back and so incredibly gorgeous & well now its up to my shoulders and blonde - ick. WHAT WAS I THINKING,,  see i heard this little voice tell me "bleach your hair" and i did , i listened to the wrong voice ! 
I dont think jesus cares what my hair looks like & i dont care what anyone else thinks to be honest, BUT im so upset w/myself for making another dumb choice w/myself.. like i said thank god hair grows.. 
For my birthday next month im going to make a little resolution to myself to cut back on my drinking, sometimes i drink ,, I really hate that i have a bad habit, i have kicked all the rest and I was never a drinker,  i went 10 yrs never  having one drink BUT see i went into that dark world and im still trying to shake it off . Once they have a hold on you , they dont want to let you go ,  I battle em  daily. Im better though because  I  experienced something supernatural, I was healed majorly, but still have little things to work out, my inner faults. I need to pray more. I need to go home ( arizona ) and heal. 
I want to sit on top the mountain & feel the sun on my face & look at the valleys below..I never thought i would love the open spaces & desert as much as i do, I want to own an adobe home  &  sit on my back tiled open patio & look out into forever  - just nature & the stars are amazing.

      Just got bk from my sons play - It was absolutly cute, ALL of them. I had 2go get my kindergarten in the same building right at the end so I motioned 2 my 8yo that I would be right bk which took longer than I wanted it to, So when I got bk 2my son he looked very sad & sd he thought I wasnt coming bk & was standing by himself ( looking very out of place ) I gave him a big hug & told I wouldnt do that to him ( broke my heart ) & we had lemonade & I met his freinds. He said he was so happy that I came because he would of been so alone, my son is gorgeous(  & thats not cuz hes mine i say that ) but he is very shy & has a stutter he has almost totally grown out of. ANYWAYS  it was very nice & the rain stopped  :) NOW on the whole gay rights issues that are going on in America is really buggin me, Im not gay, my uncle that baby sat me when I was a child is ..... BUT i dont really to be honest CARE  if someone is gay & furthermore why do i need to know about it ? I mean come on the only REAL DIFFERENCE  is that they choose to be intimate with the same sex, noone said BECAUSE your gay you will now be butch or femme, they choose those aspects on thier own BUT who cares , Is it really my business who your sleeping with AND do you really think that we all want to know ?
I mean if its for entertainment purposes (ok) BUT how does ones sex life enter the work place anyways - SHOULD  i go about announcing who im having sex with , would that be okay ?  I mean really give me a break, I  was pissed when I worked for AT&T  for 9 years & my time was wasted with diversity training towards the homosexual, you know what  I DONT CARE !
i dont think the ppl we talked to on the phones about their bills cared !?
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE ? and all i want to know is how the rainbow became associated with homosexuality - i get pissed when i see that dumb stripe on the back of someones car LIKE they need to announce it ?  SO WHAT -ENUFF IS ENUFF . noone cares if your gay but you and get over yourself ! woo hooo
your different good for you - next please - maybe if ya didnt talk about the fact that you are gay noone would discriminate against you & i dont recall any of my gay freinds not getting promoted at AT&T because they were gay
MATTER OF FACT - i didnt get promoted because my husband died & i wasnt given a huge raise because i had a funeral to plan AND ALL THE NEWBIE KIDS  i worked with that i had trained got the raise while i a now single mom of 3 didnt get it ! so YOU SEE  my disgust & the events that led me to walking out of my former job to become a stripper & the events that affected my pay - I had to survive , and my job wasnt cutting it , plus i was going nuts while the literal kids around me made more money than me because my small time off was considered putting me behind in skills even though i came right back & did my job perfect - 9 yrs of having an empty perfect file, files were for bad things there not good. so yeah  I DONT  want to hear about your gay lifestyle - I went to this gay bar " Crowbar " in Chicago one time after my rockstar performance ( lips sealed ) and i dont understand the reason that gay men stick thier finger down the back of another mans ass & smell it,  I dont see how that is a turn on for ANYONE,  here smell my butt ?
PLUS this guy overdosed and died right in front of the club from them doing so much ecstasy. JUST SAD ! My girlfreinds danced up on a podium type thing so we could look around - what a shocker. see there are places for that know what i mean - NOT IN THE WORK PLACE - PLZ ! and DID anyone know that there are aids chasers, they try to get the disease to get the attention that the other aids inflicted have ( like oh baby your sick let me take care of you ) okay now that is just evil ! In san francisco this is going on. sounds like soddom and gomorrah to me and well look what happened there...

      Just a quick note b4 I go 2c my son in a school play, I realized that I should clarify something. I dont think suicide is a good idea or a solution, I think very much the exact opposite. I brought it up to let ppl know what a horrible idea it is . Im so glad I am alive. I love my kids more than anything in the world & if i had died what would of happened to them. I was not clear or sound minded at the time I was in that state of dispair. I had no support system that was positive to help me. I only had a negative support system,
thats what evil does , it pulls you down until it gets you. THAT was my point. 
I have to walk in the rain 2day 2go see my 8yo in a school play & im glad im alive & thankful 2walk in the rain SO i can go see him. I would of missed this.I would of missed everything. I was given a second chance & w/that  im able 2tell bring joy to the world in place of the pain I brought upon myself for about a year or more. SO with that I will leave you until 2nite.  :)

      I suppose ( my new word ) I should explain by now what it is like to die ! im sure someone out there wonders what i went thru. Well all i know is that it was real quick and I went nowhere good. BUT i knew as soon as I was out that i wanted back in & was full of regret. I went nowwhere actually , i was a thought with nowhere to go - no body - nothing , just dark. I dont remember the overdosing part - or my boyfriend cleaning me and the room up or any of that , I briefly remember being on the floor but too sick to care. I then awake in bed & very ill, TOO ill, I laid there and thought " well this is not good , im going to die " and then i was in blackness, just too sick. I may have had an out of body experience BUT none the less, it wasnt good. AND I did scream for jesus to save me and i did then POOF back into a body that was not functioning & that was very bad... bery bad. BUT i had done it so that was the price to pay. I do remember telling my boyfreind that i was going to die and for the next 30 years i would watch him - which for me would go quick but for him would last 4ever ! see whats weird is that his stepmom is psychic and told him all about me years b4 he ever met me. She , herself, reads for a famous well loved medium. I dont know what to think of all that anymore 
because if mediums are truely getting their info from the wrong angels of light OF COURSE  they are going to screw up your plans !( to better promote their own ) ( that is whats nice about the viel being lifted ) SOOO him and I 
have had major struggles & maybe thats cuz the angel of darkness tricked us.  Everyone that meets me understands and feels my sensitivity - even animals. I just recently had a squirrell which i let go, the holy spirit told me it was time. It crawled into my hands when it was a baby & it slept in my shirt and ate cauliflower and broccili with me & i hand fed it every meal and loved it til it was old enuff to live on its own, It used to hug my fingers . I loved him so much - i cried when he decided not to come back, he had his own hole in the screen so he could come & go . I loved this animal so much , it was amazing to have one. I used to tap my leg & he would jump on &   I would hold onto him w/my hand  & walk around the house like that & rub his head. 
He would lift his arm so I could scratch his armpit ALL THE TIME ,  even in his sleep , like "oh yeah get that spot !" HEHE ,,, OH WELL, now i have 5 animals
1 dog (HIS) ,2cats, 2 guinea pigs(long story) and thats it. .... im a freak.

My cat is now looking up at me & i can see thru her eyes, like there is nothing there , so weird, AND the other nite she was looking at me from the upstairs balcony & looked down at me twisting her head from side to side & all there was in those eyes was blackness ( like out of a prophecy movie ) & i got the chills.

      2nites movie review :
"lonesome 30some girl sips wine at computer feeling warmly buzzed & reads blogspots for humor, sensual escape & frienDship ALL to withdraw from her oh so boreing life of being at home for 24 hours a day !" oh hehe THATS ME ! oops !
Yes feeling a little buzzed, threw my back out in my sleep - uh how the heck i did that i will never understand, i woke up when i did it but said dang im sleeping too comfy to care and zzzzzz til the alarm went off & shot up straight forward in pain ! It could be the 80lb bull dog sleepin on my leg crushing me into all weird positions crippling me in my sleep ! BUT  hey what do i do the dog has cancer AND my boyfriend has 2let him sleep in the bed. ok so 2day he went bk 2 the vet - who by the way decided that the dog has 2be cut open again & operated on again now 2get the lymph node cuz of the type of cancer he has ( 2types) yeah im talking about a dog ! NEVER MIND THE OTHER DEBTS  MY BOYFRIEND HAS , which will be fine when were living in our car - but hey who cares the dog is family he says - I  stopped cussing but you know what word i want to say (hehe) Im at my wits end w/this crap. Is it a test ? Well its for my guy , not me thats all i know ! IM feeling so blue lately & mentally heavy (like they are back). I know im whining but that is because im a whino.... remember the scene in "old school"
when Will Farrell licks his lips & talks about the beer hitting his lips & um how its so good - HAHA i love that scene and that movie, esp the streaking scene
HAHA - it takes alot to make me laugh but when i do watch out. AND also the scene in "Duplex" when Ben Stiller falls off the outside window ledge off the upstairs window in the old womans house. HAHA too funny,, 
I miss Az so much, I called my daughters dad today there to say "HI" ,, he started crying & had to go , he misses us so much. I felt so bad when we hung up, he still talks to my parents , i dont. He said they wanted to know how i was - he told them i was thinking about moving to vegas last he heard and my mom said " oh you mean to dance there ?" GEESH get over it PLUS i dont anymore ! END OF STORY ! - i do miss being sexy though - dang that has so much power - YOU HAVE NO IDEA ! LET ME TELL YOU ! BUT YOU SEE
THAT IS EVIL ! - I  used to hate the married ones, i hated them so much, said i would never get married, the lowest possible life form there was.... 
i liked the rock stars the best - my lips are sealed on that one though. 
ALTHOUGH  one time i was offered a job where i was taken in a limosine(?)
to a rock concert & put on stage to dance in front of 16,000.00 ppl  & then afterwards did a playboy.com photo shoot with them. IM NOT GIVING NAMES  THOUGH. so yeah that was neat... ah memories ( old song ) it was real neat til we realized how they pick woman from the audience to be brought back stage into the rooms to have sex with them. MY friend & I were a little buzzed & listened & laughed outside the backstage room while they did & then we ripped the sign off thier door & knocked real loud & barged in, looking real stupid w/the sign just barely showing a little out of the top of her black jeans !HAHAHA - ah to be fools again .. what a moment. 
see moments like that are funny and i miss those moments. BUT HEY if your 
not f _ _ k'in then your not allowed to be a part of the clique anymore. OH WELL-never did that so PHEW ! I SUPPOSE  im not cool ,,, GOOD !

      I suppose I should explain my name :
sedona -  ( is my favorite place in the world, so far , in arizona )
anawah -  ( is the name i heard spoken to me to be my new name ) 
okay anawah is the name in the old testament for jesus followers. The meek would inherit the earth. I suppose that someone was trying to tell me something like the holy spirit - to humble myself. I didnt know know what anawah meant , i thought it was like an american indian word, and since i hadnt read the bible yet when this happened i didnt know to look in the bible for the meaning of it, so i did a search on the net and finally found it and almost fell over. I later researched it more the other day and found out in chinook it means acorn HAHA which is a nut ,, oh my god that is so funny so yes im a nut - sedona takes a bow - thank you , thank you - yeah i feel pretty nutty not being able to talk to anyone or understand my life at all. I go to the james van praagh chatroom & talk there but still i have to guard my words as much as i try not to. 
Some of them are more nutty than me - at least i dont lie - i have no tolerance for lieing. I dont lie and dont see any reason too. LIEING drives me nuts, if you have to lie then you are a sneak and that cant be good ! isnt being sneaky like kinda being evil ? I would say so like " what can i get away with type thinking"
nope not for me. 
AND OH MANCOW , if you are reading this perchance ,, NO , no not every woman goes out and buys her own birthday gift. That is not what we do, that is absurd. you were right to be upset, i would of been upset too.( I took care of it ? ) Im at a loss for words cuz i worked with women like that & it drove me nuts.  I remember this transvestite ( i cant even spell it ) i worked with  making fun of someone i worked with about being from the suburbs. I didnt dare breath i was from the suburbs LOL since this shemale was my freind. BUT i thought what an ignorant thing to say. Yeah having land & a big home & a yard to enjoy is so uncool ? This shemale used to talk like that "oh i took care of it" like umhumm its done while blowing on his nail polish on his man hands. I have to say many times i stood up for this shemale CUZ we shouldnt judge BUT yeah im judgin now hehehe, the birthday thingie was not cool. nope not cool at all... oh well 
remember im just a stripper so my words are empty to you. sometimes the things we hate the most become the things we love, think on it.....

      Did you ever feel like you "knew" someone even though you had never met.
I must need to get a life because im addicted to my morning djs radio show. I know that sounds nuts BUT when he talks i feel like he says what i feel. Its a free speech show & his topics vary but what is so crazy is that they are topics that heavily weigh on my mind. I agree with most of what he says , not every word. Today he was talking about the downfalls of stripping & the outcomes & i must say having been there he is right, it is addictive BUT not all who danced are totally warped. He was right that they are money hungry & MOST do not end up saving their money & getting out & starting thier own businesses, honestly I only know 1 girl that did that. ONLY ONE. Im so glad that part of my life is over. I still have emotional pain from not being accepted by my former club which is so DUMB cause I found out about a prostitution ring & was of course let go the next day SO why in the heck I care what anyone thinks i have no friggin idea. Im better off now, Im healing, & you do have to mentally detox & rest & get it our of your system. Im glad I experienced the thrill of it & the famous ppl I met & the few famous moments I had BUT overall it almost killed me. I was such a huge addict when i finally was out of the business that it was out of control. OF COURSE you are given free drugs when you dance BY EVERYONE & of course you have to look thin & have lots of energy . YEAH how twisted is that & it only takes a little & your hooked.  My girlfreinds would tell me  "you look so good"
dang that is so evil. I did realize this,,NOW brace yourself because this is a shocker. OKAY here goes : evil will get you any way it can . 
think about it,,,,,,
Evil gets you and keeps you and sucks you down further and further until it destroys you , that is evil's ultimate goal. I wondered where did all that money go ( cuz i made a ton ) well evil money doesnt last, you just have to make more to replace the evil money you made the day before cuz something comes up and takes that evil money & you begin a vicious circle of making evil money - then the other evil paths open ( cuz its getting you any way it can ) and so the destruction begins . I once knew a playboy model, she told me when she met me the first time " your addicted to cocaine"
she said "i smell and feel your demons" ,, i thought what a wacko BUT i knew she was right. Days passed & she started to tell me her story of how when she modeled for playboy she did an 8ball a day or more. She found out about a resort in AZ that has you eat a root - its an ilegal root - and it cures you of all addictions. She said it was documented by witnesses 3 demons leaving her - the cocaine she said opens your soul and lets them in - they like the feeling . At our strip club christmas party in the city I proceeded to do alot of cocaine and had my photo taken, when the pictures were developed my boyfreind freaked & told me that was not my face & who was looking out of me ? I have a face on mine smiling for the camera, one of my demons Im sure. I can remember the feeling of the pull of them to do drugs .. they pull on you, til they pull you down. It is a heavy feeling, sometimes I felt so heavy I didnt want to wake up but to lie in bed & die, when eventually i did. 
I still have the photo to remind myself of who I wasnt and that evil does exist . After I died I was able ( i realized slowly ) to see ppl in photos, that arent supposed to be there OR maybe they are but noone notices them. I see them everywhere, especially on ghost cams on the net, I see tons of them , i dont know why , it goes against what i believe or am supposed to believe SEE i cant deny that JESUS saved me, SO where do i go from there ?
The bible says they are demons, not in heaven, that you cant see your loved ones. Some of the bible is written for its time but its message transcends time. I dont think what the general jist of the bible says is wrong. I mean dang just be a good person, the gospel john does say you have to be born again which i know am, I didnt even realized what happened to me. It is a miracle & i certainly cannot deny that. I just dont understand what all the ppl in the pictures are ? ALL my life I have been plagued by never feeling alone if you know what i mean but never able to see spirits although my family has seen the ones around me, my husband and daughters father ,my daughter saw em when she was a baby, and my daughters sister. SO why cant i see em except in photographs. Am i a doorway ? I tried to meditate to contact them a few yrs ago & I was alone one day & overworked & tired , my kids had gone to Az to visit relatives & i was enjoying laying in bed doing nothing, so i meditated. I had a set of hands scoop their hands up inside mine & I immediately paniced & sat up in bed & freaked out. They were human hands. They did not grab me or pull me BUT they did touch me & there was noone there. That terrifys me. I can meditate & hear the room open & hear scuffling & hear sounds like light whisps of what I can only describe as them moving about BUT im so scared of them. How did this happen to me & what is going on. When i was a child I had out of body experiences & i hated them. I couldnt control em & even had em in the daytime. One time I even had a spirit talk out of me & yell at my parents in the middle of the night to get out of my bedroom , WHICH i cant believe they told me at dinner with guest present at the spaghetti warehouse, i will never forget THAT moment. I of course dont remember doing it at all. SO thru out my life I have had some really supernatural experiences that deal with a spiritworld BUT what spiritworld , according to christianity it is all demonic. IM not demonic & could i be born into a demonic following family , is that what being open minded gets you ? SO im at a loss as to what is going on with me. ALL i know is that jesus christ is real and where do i go from there ? Is it a sin for me to acknowledge these spirits ? Do i have to repent each time i wonder about them, some i have photographed . IM SO CONFUSED.

      I was reading what I wrote the other day "feeling violated".
I cant believe how insane I sound BUT that is how I get when I feel violated!
(My email is still going somewhere else.) I really need to get this resolved. Im mad at myself for sounding so crazy BUT I suppose that is part of being human and having those moments where we go off and then later say "what was I thinking?" Sometimes were better off saying nothing at all  like we learned in kindergarten - nothing nice to say then dont talk - UNLESS
the person really deserves it ! HAHA, okay I will write more later

      Sometimes I wish I lived in the city. I worked in the city for many years and had just started to really learn my way around . I would sometimes like to step onto a busy street fresh right out of my apartment overlooking all the ppl passing by and walk among the shops with coffee in hand. I would love to see all the ppl intermingling and life existing as it does. I live in the suburbs with a home Im restoring and a yard too. The ppl that lived here previously decided to do nothing with this property and let it literally become overgrown and neglected. There is a pond in my backyard that a previous owner years ago put in and now we have to completley gut it and landscape it and undig the foliage thats taken over it. I attempted to start this task yesterday with 10 lawn bags full and only a SMALL dent made in the backyard clean-up. I moan and groan while Im doing it but love the idea of accomplishing this task and being able to sit by it this summer & enjoy the sound of the running water since it is set up with a small waterfall. I silently in my head shout insults at the previous 3 guys that lived here and let this once beautiful property go to waste. I pray that the landlord will grow tired of having so many properties to keep up on and will just ask us one day if we would like to buy the place. I keep telling myself "one day this will be mine and what do i want it to look like ". Im going to paint the whole first floor to look like the inside of an adobe. I always wanted one and figure I may as well give myself one as much as I can. Im going to paint cracks in the walls to look like the cracks are really there. Im also going to paint the ceilings the same color. Im going to put low wattage lights in the halls on the walls like scones to give the affects of candles being lit in them. I want to create a cozy warm environment instead of these cold white walls looking at me all day. Living where it snows requires me to do some decortaing to be able to handle these long cold gloomy winters. Im listening to "The Passion of Christ" soundtrack. My neighbor burnt it for me on her cd burner. She said she cant handle the soundtrack , it makes her cry. I still have not seen the movie due to boyfreind working so much and babysitters being non existent . I will go see it , I think everyone should. I get the chills when I listen to it, just knowing the man that wrote the music for the movie said he was confronted by the devil himself in attempts to stop soundtrack from being completed.

      I realized after I was saved that I had felt "that calm" once before, after my husband died I went thru a scarey calm period. I drove around and stared at the sky( i still dont why ). I donated everything I would never need or use. I lost almost everything to having to file bankruptcy and I stared out the window at a bush that grew in my yard with purple flowers that I never planted. I think my husband planted it for me because purple is my favorite color & he wanted me to have something to look at while I sat and stared out that window. I looked out that window facing my backyard , I lived in Arizona so it wasnt much to look at except that purple bush. My life mirrored "what dreams may come" I had to leave the movie theater. A guy took me to see it and halfway thru he was like " uh do you want to leave ?"
I said "yes" and we never spoke of it. I looked like her and my husbands name was "chris" studying to be a dr who was killed in an auto accident. just little references were the same. PLUS i understood her grief, grief so strong it doesnt allow you to move. I hate that grief. After he died noone thought I was the same, I could no longer do my corporate job and walked around like there was a cloud around me , like in a dream. I couldnt understand why everyone was so angry all the time with lifes little daily problems. I wanted to tell everyone there is something bigger at hand here and noone seemed to get it, LIKE i was the crazy one. I would go out in public and cry and have to leave whereever I was the pain was so overwhelming. I used to sit on his grave all day on a blanket and talk to him. ONCE a cold wind out of nowhere swept across me. Ive never gotten over it,, I just hide it better now. I was saved in october of 2003 when I tried to commit suicide ,, at first after I came back after dieing i was in severe pain for days from poisoning myself. Time passed and the depression and addictions I realized were gone, I was lighter and overwhelmed again at experiencing screaming for Jesus to come get me when i was dead and then being "poofed" back into a body that wasnt alive and feeling it take its first breath. SO emotional now,,,I started to overwhelming have "that calm" feeling come back. Whats wonderful is now I can have that calm all the time. I feed some homeless ppl on fridays and I want to help them all, some have dark eyes and dont want to be helped , those i pray for alone. BUT there are others that just had life get the better of them and had businesses and wives and husbands and kids and now have nothing. THAT scares the hell out of me. I miss them when I cant go to feed them. I want to help them so much. Ive started bringing them clothes and blankets and anything that we dont need that we have. We have so much and we dont even realize it til we see or get to know someone who has nothing. I get caught up sometimes in the world and the material things I want and now I have learned and am learning that I dont need those things , things take up my time and my money and who am I to have so much when so many have so little.If every  family took in one homeless family would there be any homeless left ? Everyone has so much to offer and I just dont feel like us as Americans do enough to help our homeless . Good jobs are too few and I fear with the borders opening and the mexicans coming across that it will only get worse. Im not predujiced by any means I just think there are alterior motives to allow them to cross to the border. I think we should teach them to have a healthy self sustaining way of life with clean water and well built streets and homes, teach them trades , we all have time to donate. Im overwrought with the way the world feels and is. I feel so much pain for things that  are out of my control., the suffering in this world is overwhelming. I have 3 children and the idea of being homeless scares me out of my mind. I read an article today about a family that was homeless thru plain truth ministries and it brought me to tears that one time when they were holding up signs saying "will work for food" that a car of teenagers threw cokes at them hitting the wife in the face. "will work for food" can you imagine ? All they want to do is eat, they dont want your money , they just want to eat, the couple and their kids. They missed one rent payment and had 3 days to get out of their home.,, how scarey is that. My boyfreind of 5 years is the only one working in our home now and even though i receive child support it is still terrifying in todays times to only have one adult working. We are a family of 5 and life is so overwhelming at times. I get sad and then remember that everything really is ok, at least im not homeless. Get my point....
Romans 14:13 Let us not therefore judge one another any more:but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brothers way. Romans 15:1 We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.

      Today my boyfreind of 5 yrs told me"your not that carrot anymore dangling in front of me!"  Sometimes his words are so painful that they bruise me for days. I dont say anything cruel to him(anymore) believe me I have had my
moments.  I told him this morning if something didnt change ( a certain 
something ) then I would need to make other arrangements. I mean other arrangements for my life. If 2 cant work in the same direction what is the friggin point after 5 yrs. Geesh get on board. I dont ask for alot. I cant really post the problem but its his health it mainly affects.AND isnt that important for him to be alive as long as possible , our days are numbered daily. I think I would rather live alone then have someone else create my misery. I can come up with misery on my own , which btw I dont want either. Im a simple girl. I dont want alot. I just want to be loved. I would and do stand by my mate. I am survivor and have survived BUT what am I survivin for ?
Yesterday he told me he hated me, each time he gets upset , he hates me. I miss Arizona.Im out here in suburbia of Illinios, I have decided to not have any of my proir freinds due to the nature of my prior job which leaves me freindless pretty much and that is ok. Whatis not ok is that all i have is him and he hates me. SOOOO  I make amazing positive changes for my health and future and I guess that only applys to me, those changes dont have to apply to him.lm not getting trophied up for work each day like i used to and what is the point in gettng trophied up for someone that hates you and is never around anyways. I pray to God to heal him and be patient with me and him. I pray to God to make him want to change for his health and
future. I pray alot. I dont know how much longer I can STAY and pray. I remember once when I was younger, this guy took me out to dinner and at dinner he leaned over and started singing out loud "you are so beautiful" to me. Not only did I hear him but so did the whole restaurant. I will never forget that moment AND in a nutshell I want life to be filled with moments like that and I want to give someone moments like that . I used to have too much love to give, Now I just wonder if I will ever have anyone again that wants those moments from me ? I  cant believe he said Im no longer that carrot. I used to model and be in amazing top fit shape and although im not heavy we could both use a little toning up , but hey thatsit SO i just cant believe he said im no longer the carrot, I do the atkins type diet while he whoofs down a box of macadamia nut cookies ( hes 6'5")and im told im not the carrot. GEESH,Actually Im in really good shape. Im sure he doesnt just mean that about the looks, im sure there is more to it... Its sad after 5 years that we have grown apart. I have always wanted a long term relationship and I never seem to get it. The first time and only time I ever got married I ended up being a widow almost to the date. We were married on Sept 16 of 1996 and he was killed on April 26th of 1997 by a drunk driver. I gave birth to our son on October 25th 1997. I was 4 months pregnant at his funeral. 
I was the first one to the funeral home. I remember that hot Arizona sun beating down on me in my black dress and that hot Arizona sun greeted me the day the I found out he was killed. I moved to get away from that hot Arizona sun , felt like I was in the movie Ground Hog day reliving that moment over and over. I still now over 6 years later am just now getting rid of my funeral heels. I kept them for some morbid reason. The only place I ever wore em was to a funeral... isnt that sad. Those stupid shoes have been staring at me for over 6 years and I just couldnt get rid of em.,, realizing I will never wear em again finally am seperating with em. dumb huh.I never thought I would meet anyone after he died that compared to him and that I had true love. I did meet someone though and Im still with him. I think maybe its time for a "ME" break. I think maybe its time to reevaluate my choices and my plans. I feel lightness ahead and a sun shining down on me that I welcome BUT the journey there is so hard and long and sometimes I dont know if I have it in me to step out onto that road.

      Okay Nasa says that they have the ability soon to read our thoughts before we speak them or as we think them . If Nasa says they are near being able to do this, then that means they have already done it. If they can remote view your thoughts dont you think that they can remote alter your thoughts ? AND furthermore did you know that as a weapon of war we have the ability to cause earthquakes AND dont you think they already have ?!  Technology is so out of control it does more harm for us than good.It is a weapon being used against us as a means of controling the masses. There is nothing that you do that you can hide. I had a wacky roommate awhile ago so I ordered some software that claimed to let me look at personal things about ppl AND well thru my discoveries I found out that there were satelite pictures of me that I could buy . I want to know why and when a satelite was following me around and taking my photo ?! Was someone really sitting behind their computer terminal one day sipping on some coffee just waiting for me to leave my home or my job or where ever else they decided to follow me on those days or every day. Who are these ppl ? How do you get a job like that ? I was being stalked by the government who is supposed to protect me. Hey now, isnt everything the government says put in place to protect us ? Patriot Acts 1 and 2 ,, did anyone even know that 2 was slipped in on us quietly when we caught Saddam.,,,and oh yeah by the way pssst,, (in real quiet voice)" act 2 was passed and SADDAM WAS CAUGHT TODAY". All anyone heard was Saddam was caught. I heard that Bin Laden died already of kidney failure and they are waiting til  november or a sooner timeframe to release the story so America will say "good job Mr President " and vote him right back into office. The government cant control what ppl just seem "to know" and yeah maybe that is why the are trying to make mind reading machines so they will know who to take out before they speak it,, interesting isnt it. WATCH OUT James Van Praagh and Sylvia Browne.(.er uh) maybe they would know the govt is reading their mind before their mind is read( uh er uh am i saying that right OK enuff is enuff ! )
1 John 4:1 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God:because many false prophets are gone out into the world.
Im amazed how many ppl I talk with that tell me that they are of no religion and that Im a christian and that christianity is for kindergartners,, well I say this to them YES in kindergarten you learn the basics and that takes you thru the rest of your life and without a strong foundation you will waver thruout life and have doubt . I love  that im in kindergarten. I was also told by someone that church is for kindergarteners and that this person prefered the "new" way of thinking. Nothing is new, we as humans are new but the scriptures are not new. There is an amazing amount of evidence to say that Jesus Christ did the things that the gospels say he did, even down to archeological evidence & handwritten scrolls. The amount of evidence is so amazing that there is more for him than any other so called prophet born before or after him. Plus having been supernaturally healed and saved from death when i screamed his name I think that is all I need to say that Jesus Christ is real and he is an awesome god & Im just glad I found out now at 34 how wrong all my life I was and how easy it is to be deceived by what you think you want to hear or be part of. Matthew 7:13 Enter ye in at the strait gate:for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:
Matthew 7:14 Because strait is the gate,and and narrow is the way,which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. 
Its simple uncomplicated and not secretive. Doesnt that sound like such an easy peaceful way to live. I want to shout to the world what i felt and feel.
I want to laugh out loud at what I felt and know. I GET IT...... LOL.

      Well after a week & 4 operators from India later I was finally educated on how my email settings were changed or hacked or whatever you want to call it. I simply just stopped getting emails & even as we speak I watch them attempt to be received into my outlook box, only to disappear. Hey guess what little ole me is now boreing & stays at home & for fun likes to surf the net like every other person or american & I ask "why?" ,, why bother me,, what does a domesticated mom of 3 sitting at home have that frightens anyone out there in bigbadgovernement  land ?  Do I really bother them so much surfing the net of propaganda that they need to steal my email. You know what this is a SIGN to all Americans _ THEY are watching us and they are out to get us, every last one of us that has a thought of our own in our tiny little heads , Well WORLD I guess I have been flagged , ONCE again Im
guilty of knowing too much, seems to always be my problem. One day the net will not even be available to us , everything is going to be censored. I listen to a DJ named Mancow on Q101 in Chicago, IL ,, check out his website
www.mancow.com check out his political links,, I so agree !!!!!!!!!!!! 
check out www.crosswynd.com as well, that is an amazing site too. ... 
God just please open the floodgates of heaven and rain on us now,,, If these are not the endtimes I am truely afraid of it getting any worse,, these
are scarey times we live in , not just for americans but for the world and the lives and souls that are being sacrificied daily to acquire peace,, can you believe i just said that,, its not peace ,,its war and a spiritual one as well for our souls . My eyes were opened after October of 2003 . I didnt even know they were closed before then.. 
John 10:9 I am the door:by me if any man enter in,he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. John 10:10 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.

      Im enjoying being able to log my thoughts momentarily. I feel I have so much profound to say & then i look at my blog on my blog page & the words are so big and well that just bothers me. Im impatient & want to be able to do so much with my blog sight but Im off to the computer hospital in the next few days to update my system & get more memory & work out some bugs that seem to have crawled into my computer. In the meantime plus excuse the huge words on my blog page ( hehe). Im in a really funky mood lately. I went thru an annointing for about a month and now I feel empty . Im confused and in a state of what to do with my life. "Life can only be understood backwards;but it must be lived forwards" (Soren Kierkegard) . I went thru a life altering change in October of 2003.
I have lived many little lives within my life and so much that I dont know who I am anymore. Im always trying to figure it out & may have just resolved that I cant figure it out. I have to give it to god , and isnt that wonderful that I can. If I would of understood the meaning of this growing up during my teen yrs and 20's I would of had a totally different life w/alot less mistakes. I feel as though Im not going to ever be of worth now that I have made mistakes and am lost. I know jesus forgives us of all our sins but I still battle w/myself & my future & my capacity to offer the world something of meaning. Im just little ol me, what can I do ? I feed the homeless with my church on fridays & I speak of my "being saved" to whoever has a willing ear BUT I know that is by means nothing to what I could do & have the power to do. I will have to continue to pray to God to point me in the right direction & give me an amazing future that Im possibly preparing for now. Im currently reading "The Case for Christ" be Lee Sobel & I love this book. In my heart having been a new age seeker I am now transformed into a christian thru my recent experiences. I want to scream to the world what I experienced & the change I felt in my life which as blog goes on , Im 
sure I will get around to it. Im a survivor, I have always felt I had to do it on my own , anyway I could , being a single mother of 3 & widowed as of 1997 I realized then that our systems are not set up to help the single mom, there isnt a wealth of benefits or monies or options available to us to survive. I tried em all only to be told I made too much money EVEN though the money I made was slowly going to bills,rent , food & by that I dont mean any monies being squandered on what wasnt needed. I used to be such a loving woman & it seemed life ( that I never knew was to be mine ) got the worst of me or found the worst of me. I felt I had to survive & give my kids a lifestyle that was safe & gave them the basic needs & working my job of 8years at really decent pay for 1997 wasnt cutting it anymore. I deciced after bodybuilding for years & hours a day that I would use my looks to model. I started getting alot of internet offers & I even did some website modeling. I was told by all my fellow gym rats that I should become an Entertainer,, well lets just call it what it is a "stripper" . I pondered the idea & for along time checked out the local clubs & watched what they did & built myself up to be able to mentally dance & then one day I said to myself 
"I can do this" & if not me for my kids. (welfare is not worth it and there is no way to properly survive on welfare nor do i take advantage of the system , never claimed it didnt want to ) SO I made that big step & became a stripper. Now 4 years later I look back & after having to decide to not strip anymore &  think to myself "what was I thinking " .. granted I have some interesting stories & some small famous moments but I have to sum it by saying it wasnt worth it & after going into the dark all I know is thank god I found the light, even if for a moment it was from me taking my own life... and with that I say "good day" til tomorrow..

      I have some amazing photos I have taken that I would like to post and well just found out that I cannot do that because Im new and
that option isnt available to me ,,, DANG! I sent some ghost photos to a ghost site and they never published my photos and im really irritated , they are REAL for one and they are GOOD.
I saw some that were really no big deal on those ghost sites ,,that is comparing them to my own ,so why wont they post mine ?! Im battling with the idea of having them and that I took them. I have been  told different things about them, some say they are real souls and some say that they have to be demons because the dead is in heaven.

      This is a true story.....
When I was growing up I started having episodes that where I lost track of time, I would go thru walls of water and to made up worlds & I would panic & sometimes I would remember & sometimes I would just be gone & would think I had been asleep but would come to & my parents would be shaking me and asking me my name. I would be like "uh what the heck is going on?" 
I was told by someone on the net that I was abducted by aliens when I was little if I walked thru walls of water. I have never heard such a thing. I do know that at the same time this was going on that I was having out of body experiences where I would float up by the cieling and would be looking around my bedroom but had no idea how I got there & I would panic & in less than a second I would be looking out of my body back in bed, quicker than you can think it. Sometimes I forget that I went thru this becuz it was so long ago and I have no explanation for it. A few years ago I had started meditating daily and deeply & one day I was exhausted from working so hard & meditated for hours & while I was doing so I felt a pair of invisible hands slip their hands or scoop their hands up inside mine, I had a pillow between my arms & my hands were hanging off the edge of the bed. I was very scared.
I dont really meditate anymore becuz I know have proof there are things around us that we cant see & if afraid that "it" touched me. I dont want to be touched again. I also dont know what touched me, if it was good or evil. I also worry next time something will grab my hands and pull me off the bed. 
I dont think I could handle that, I can barely believe I was touched to begin with. I dont know if im plagued by my lineage and familiar spirits. My mother was always very open minded & as a child I always had ghost activity in all my homes , even to this day. I have tried over the past couple months to not acknowlede them or go there becuz if it is evil I dont want anything to do with it. I dont want to be deceived or ignorant of the situation.

      Sometimes I really like being me. I have had a chance to feel something real and awesome (jesus) & theres no way to convince someone who hasnt felt it that it is real...i have so much to say ever since jesus looked my way (  the change inside of me by mercy me). I love this song.... leave the world in wonder of the change inside of me and you are the reason for this change.......

      shocker-"J" called me to tell me he was on his way home and worked late & called me from work- ha i know that trick,,, but im sure its legit. I cant be untrusting all the time. I cant control him , I cant worry about him. I can live and that is it. I have to decide how i want to live........and being untrusting is not living. If he cheats that is his guilt and his problem. I can protect me. I can love me. Maybe someday a real prince charming will find me, BUT in the meantime I can love me and all around me.
My husband used to say "IF you died tomorrow how would everyone remember you?" that was his motto.. ( hes dead now ) weird huh........ I miss him everyday. 
Im now in denial where I no longer let myself even remeber him alot anymore. 
I greived SO HARD. I would even say abnormally hard. SO all I can do is not think abt him til like now, something will pop into my head and I have to acknowledge it and then let it go ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      I wonder if it would be okay after my feet are done soaking if I slipped on my dancer heels and just wore them around for awhile? I have a freind that quit dancing & is in michigan ( a small town ) & she called me to tell me she is addicted to the shoes & still wears her heels & that they think she is a freak. The shoes make your legs look awesome. I love em. Plus being in those shoes is an awesome workout - the way they are cut and made - actually helps shred my legs....

      Im obsessed still with the thoughts that bombard me about my former career.
I am lots of times during my day flooded with thoughts that take over my mind and start to go back to memories of the club life... I hate it too. I want to be over it and shrug away the fact that i did it. I dont feel guilty that I did it. I was never approving of the lifestyle b4 I danced & now am still not after having done it BUT while I was doing it I totally justified it.... OF COURSE. It is easy to justify what one does while they are doing it becuz why would "i be bad". I know my true self and Im a great person. BUT what I did was not great.........I dont think IM less of a human being for having done it but i truely dont want to do it ever again. I sometimes think to myself if times got real tough I know I could do it . I then start to remember what it was like & the strangeness of each man & being that close to another human and teasing them ..( thinking abt myself & how I am and then how they are ) like IE: Does my breath smell ? Do i smell good to him?
Am I thin enuff for this one ? Do I look ok in this ? Is my makeup smeared? Are my false eyelashes lifting yet ? hahaha,, one nite as a joke i left them like that.
I was very buzzed to say the least and at the end of the night they had started to peel off & looked like giant fuzzy caterpillars on my eyelids waving in the wind & I wouldnt let anyone pull them off and kept saying "WHAT?".......... it was funny then not now :) ..................

      He came home last nite & needed to vent abt his job. I understand so I let him vent and made him chicken & salad . We do the atkins diet. He wants to look for a new job after he has 2 years at this current one. ( he is doing well for now where he is at ) BUT he said "I need to go to church again soon". He has to work on sundays and cannot have it off for church. He told me yesterday he is starting to sway towards my way of thinking lately....good vs evil...... I sorta think that is one or the other. If you are around evil you are subject to its demise. It will get you anyway it can. I know a girl in london, whose mom was a nurse that worked with nuns ( if i remember correct ) and one night a new nun ( that noone liked ) was talking to her mom the nurse abt good & evil ( in the middle of the nite while patients were sleeping & it was sorta dark where they were ) anyways, the new nun said to the nurse "evil gets you anyway it can"
and then the new nuns eyes turned a sick evil yellow and smiled an eerie smile as if to reveal its true nature and not a nun at all. The nurse said she truely believed she had met 'el diablo' and the new nun was gone the next day. (true story) . I started immediately to see differences after i was saved & i was in shock for abt a month that noone else saw the differences of good and evil and how easy evil fools you and decieves and you dont even realize its happening.
which was happened to me all my life.

      ah, today I love my life. Im such a simple girl ......
my friend "P" knocked on my door at like 900am and asked me if I would take her to some garage sales since her car was in the shop til this afternoon, so I did. I live in a really nice upscale area and hadnt been to any ever around here and so I decided to see what they had. I hate to admit I am now officially addicted to the garage sales in my neighborhood. I spent 10 bucks and got my daughter and myself some awesome clothes to hang out in. I got tommy hilfiger sexy long sleeve shirts for myself & my daughter brand new clothes from old navy ( a whole outfit for $3.00) which included a pink tye dyed tight tank, a pink zip up hoodie & jeans where the front is washed out a little ( the new look) with bell bottoms. I then bought some cyprus mulch and spent the rest of the day doing my yard & digging up wild trees that took root all over my yard(previous owner here did not do yard work for like 3 years , i had a jungle when i moved in) & now the progress im making is finally showing and starting to look landscaped and awesome. I felt proud today looking around the yard 7 realizing the amount of work i have done and how awesome it is coming along.
Im drinking a beer & soaking my feet to celebrate all my hard work ( and of course lounging in my new sexy comfy shirt & "J"s boxers with my black bandana on my head. AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH today life was good. I even got a "hey honey " "i love you " today from "J" b4 he went to work.

      I bought this book for $5.00 at ALDI , I mention that becuz its $13 at the Christian bookstores.
I bought it becuz a freind told my it would help me with "J". It talks about how after the first couple years the fizzle fizzles out and why. I still have the fizzle for him BUT its just that I dont trust him AND that is bad.  I have had a problem with him not coming home after work,he claims hes at work & from now on call & check b4 I jump to assumptions. He said he is so emotional over me that he doesnt have room for another. I asked him why he was so aloof abt me not sleeping in our room & he said he was giving me my space & it was my choice to not sleep in there. "J" also read "The Art of War" so he was I assume pulling some ZEN trick on me right back at me. I have moved back into the bedroom cuz he cleaned it(haha) BUT I have slept really badly the last 2 nights becuz Im mentally tormented over what we have endured for 5 years.  I do need  2have that "I dont care" attitude becuz I can do nothing over nothing. "J" has been lately doing what is required of him which he wasnt doing and i mean around the house stuff. I dont know how long it will last but at least at the moment it is calm. Im still upset abt alot. My friend "P" said 'maybe right now im right where im supposed to be no matter how much i hate the moment becuz the moment will pass."
Its hard to let "stuff" go.  I do wonder what life would be like with someone else. I think everyone does that though. Ill be back later tonight.

      I bought a new computer monday and caught 8 viruses as soon as I went on line. I added
"EZ Trust antivirus" before I went on line(which came with my Yahoo DSL service as a free extra add on.)  It didnt work and neither did Nortons Trialware for 15days option. I  caught the "Welchia" virus among other viruses and thus my whole brand new computer was ruined. I took it back and www.pcmartonsale.com gave me a brand new hard drive and Norton Antivurus 2003 for free plus free labor. I bought 2004 from them also. I left paying only $30 which I think is just awesome.

Im just another passer by

to an illusion with no substance
just a mere thought 
or per chance a dream , fantasy

      "J" came home & started fighting w/me. I kicked him outta my computer room. "J" wanted to know what i ate for dinner. IDIOT. He went to work at 800am and came home at 1020pm and he asks what did I eat for dinner ? what does he care? I said "nothing!" "happy now" ...................
I really hope he wasnt expecting one of my hot cooked meals waiting for him like I was doing cuz I was being sickening nice for awhile. Im done with that. Im sure he ate and or his new girl made sure he ate. He can go to her house for late nite snacks......... He has retired to bed and his tivo have now become one. Im really suprised he came home at all since tomorrow is his day off. He got mad at me becuz I did not reply to him saying "happy birthday" gee thanks... IDIOT.
When his birthday is getting near he always tells me of all the expensive things he would like knowing at the moment i cannot afford them. His brithday is near christmas too & he always makes sure to throw in his christmas list too BUT never ever once has asked me in 5 yrs what i ever wanted for either one. SO abt 2 yrs ago I started ignoring him & simply did nothing for him at all and then told him why( explaining to him i dont know what is wrong with him to act that way) he was mad today and said at least i say "happy birthday" to you thats more than i get from you. "J" is a taker ( and takes whatever he can ) . My birthday wish is for a nice christian man to come into my life soon-maybe semi cute not too cute  cuz i have that now & he is the woman in our ending relationship. I want a rugged man ( which mine looks like but emotionally SUX) . "J" looks like a sexy lumberjack, BUT he thinks his looks will get him everywhere like "look at my cute smile".  Im just so over it........
I have a little crush on my morning dj. www.mancow.com.
you can check him out. Hes 6' tall like I like but very married. I still like to look though but know he is untouchable.

      I think after these 5 yrs with "J" I am going to need a long time alone and or therapy to learn what is normal again. I wont know what to do with myself being in normal surroundings. I used to think I could sit and wait and god would take care of it. I think "J" must be willing and isnt .
When I called him at work today he said based on decisions i want to make as of today ( my bday ) he will consider it his first day of us not together & he will live his life from now on according to that. LIKE  I GAVE him an open door not to come home tonight when he never does anyway, so now he can cheat and why wouldnt he be cuz in his mind i  dont want him. ( so weird ) 
I guess I should be happy he doesnt come home cuz then we dont fight, and the house is more calm. Im ill over the whole thing. I went tanning today which felt awesome & did some legs(trained).
I thought about getting a 1 bedroom just for now for kids and I til I have them go to az ( trying to aviod sending them w/o me). I need to put all my stuff in storage & remove myself from this home so my pain will go away FIRST & then proceed to figure out what i want to do with my life.
IM SO PISSED "J" COULD JUST DISREGARD ME SO EASILY ! That is what I knew all along and motivates me more to go. I really am so bruised emotionally I would not do well in another relationship becuz now I dont even know how to have one... 
AND what is he telling his new girl ? uuugghhh I am just sickened.
AND maybe she is not new. I suppose Jesus will have to be my husband for awhile..........on the other side of every dieing dream his love is waiting for you.......

      There is an air of sadness on my street. The viewing was today for the guy that killed himself across the street. My neighbor asked me to walk over and say sorry for their loss. I wasnt comfortable doing so but did. I think the woman was not in her right mind, it was her brother in law to be that killed himself. My neighbor told her how I was the last one to see him. I really didnt want to tell them that. I guess he was going thru a divorce. We ordered flowers for them.
I dont really think that they will have persay a "viewing" since he shot himself in the head ,, maybe more of a rememberance time. The funeral is tomorrow. I had a really wierd thought today. ya know the movie "Final Destination" well how death finds you when its time. 
Well i would of died in october of 2003 by suicide, but i didnt,, so in a sense i wonder if earthly areas have to take into account for the death that i did not have & so someone had to take my place in the same sense of the way. I know that sounds so dumb. I hope he had jesus also. I know some ppl dont believe in that ( being born again) 
but after what I went thru I dont see how I personally couldnt not believe. My neighbor said her brother was dieing of AIDS and he died and came back BUT when he died he was tormented by demons & came back for 20 days & told everyone. I guess that was his testimony. I was going to go into one of my new age chatrooms the other day & played a game with myself where I open the bible & read where I opened to , and it was ECCLESIASTES 9-18 
im not going to write it all here, I have another blog where i do that 
but basically it says in part of it, that there is nothing new. I love that.
"there is no new thing under the sun",,,,

      Today is my bday, really no big deal. I as a present was going to start my moving out process & in the process of getting things in order, started to freak out & couldnt stop crying. I dont know why I cried because my guy is such an ass I dont know why I would not want to leave. Im not afraid to be alone. I dont know what triggered it. I was mad at myself for not being able to stop crying. My guy who im not gonna call my my guy anymore ( he is now called "J") took a plastic bag w/achange of clothes in his side saddle bag to work today, and has the nerve to tell me he thought we were going to work things out. Yeah right after you do whatever your gonna do that is going to require you to change your clothes b4 you come home. IDIOT ... He said I didnt get a chance to wish you happy birthday (when i called abt the car),, & that he thought of something special we could do tonight, was this special thing to be b4 or after he cheats on me today ? AND it is after 900pm and he is still not home and he gets off work at 600pm AND this happens everyday AND he says he works late.. okay he must think im an IDIOT. I dont know why he cares if i move out since he doesnt come home ever & when does he rots on his xbox playing games or watches tivo ... I dont even sleep in our bedroom & have removed anything that is mine or of me. I closed the door & never went back in it a week ago & it doesnt get cleaned.

      I saw a post about me on another site that said i sounded like a stereotypical dancer. hhmm most definatley not that. I thought that was pretty well explained in this blog & w/in these archives. you cant base a judgement about me from one comment i made on anothers blog w/o reading my blog first as well... comment was made by someone who danced for 18 yrs SO her personal experience was much different than mine. maybe she worked in small clubs where there were not famous ppl, or agendas, or prostitution rings and or playboy photo shoots. Maybe her clubs were small & quieter & less noticed than the scale I worked on & the ppl I worked with.
I was ultimatley let go from the big club I worked at because I did not become part of the prostitution ring. I then did go to a smaller queiter club with a freind of mine & just decided after that the whole lifestyle in general was getting to be a bit much. I mean for how long do you really want to hear a different man every time you work tell you to "touch it" . I state the true brutual facts of what i went thru & countless other dancers do go thru wether they choose to mention the bad & the ugly to protect the industry. Well noone protected me
I dont see any need to return any favors. I was stalked , I had my tires slashed, I even had a crazy man threaten to "whack me" in a club because i didnt want his advances. I worked small and large clubs, I experienced them all, I was in a shooting a few yrs ago in a large club in New Mexico. It is a dangerous environment & it does attract a certain level of men ( regulars ) that are looking 4 something perverse that they cant seem to satiate. I had one client that asked me to make scarey faces and growl in the large club I worked at, He was a VIP regular. I had another VIP regular ( BIG $)
that traveled to poor 3rd world  countries to have sex with basically very young girls ( 12-13ish) because the famalies needed the $.
I dont care if ppl are upset that I tell the truth about the industry because it is my blog & my right to do so. Im not gonna put hearts & flowers all over & pretend stripping is glamorous just because I have $1000.00 of dollars of clothes on & the best makeup & accessories money can buy. Evil can make you look good too. Evil can give you a path to temporarily succeed in also to string you along until it ruins you. I can push rewind & clearly see the paths. It is amazing the woman that stripped for 18 yrs was able to NOT walk down one of those paths sometime in that period or maybe chooses not to discuss it, the more you dance the more numb & OK things are to do that werent OK to do once upon a time when you started. YOU do get hardened by the industry & ppl do make mistakes. Maybe that woman thought those things are OK all along........AND BY THE WAY,,,
 yes stockbrockers even did supply us with drugs, I am in Chicago ya know, so yes Don, i agree with you on the "stereotypical"comment.
I had  a group that I sat with that spent big $ & always wanted to see us outside of work & to take excstasy with them, uh yeah fun
no thank you there ! YOU KNOW its amazing you post a nice comment and everyone loves you and you post a negative comment and the you become the biggest bitch to ever blog. dang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      Today across the street a man that was house sitting killed himself in his van inside the open garage. I saw him. I saw him punch in a the key pad on the gargae keypad lock. I remember the black van sitting on the street in front of the house. I thought it was the man that lived there. I thought the man and I exchanged a look. I always look at the man across the street & he looks back, no big deal, just a look . I thought that man and I did that. I went in the basement to do laundry & my neighbor came banging on the door & told me something terrible had happened. I looked out my door & the street was full of cops, an ambulance, firetruck and detectives in unmarked cars. My street was in chaos. All my neighbors were outside. I had thought the man that lived there was the one I saw moments b4 this. My neighbors that lived there were out of town & never came home or turned off the lights tonight that are all on in every room of the home. I watched the whole grueling thing until that van was towed away. I even watched the body be put into a regular looking van with tinted windows like a soccer mom would drive, i thought that was odd. I watched them put down thick blue liners to sit on inside the drivers seat and push the van out of the garage and into the street to tow it ,, i was surprised to see all the windows in place since the man had shot himself in the head. I saw that man moments b4 he took his life , we exchanged eye contact. Im saddened that he drove over there and I watched him press the numbers into the keypad knowing he was unlocking the garage to pull his van off the street into to it to kill himself. I saw him . Im sad that for that one moment he looked at me knowing I may of been the last person who looked at him and I had no idea. It is a weird feeling . I wasnt sad all day, I wasnt sad when the family screamed outside & cried . I wasnt sad til it was all over & i remembered seeing him punch the numbers into the key pad and us looking at each other. I know what it is like to be that sad. I heavly medicated myself slowly though and over a period of hours not intentionally but out of sadness, i basically just gave up not realizng I was killing myself but not really caring either. I cant imagine planning it though - ive been sad enuff i can do it but wont BUT I CANT  imagine driving to someone elses home with full intent to blow my head off with the gun ( rifle  he   had  ) sitting beside me in the van. I cant imagine pain worse then i have felt & pain so bad that you would premeditate your own hours b4 and during your planned death. Did he plan it all weekend & knew he had to get it done b4 they came back from easter weekend, cuz they are still not back. I cant imagine living there to be called by the other relatives & told one of my relatives killed himself in my garage. AND the other man that pulled up behind him got there right when he did it or a moment after. We were all asked if we heard the gunshot. i didnt .......
The family intervention also did not work. The family decided they cant handle my boyfreind, he is too much out in left field i was told by them & his sister never called me bk after she promised me she would so they wrote him and I off. SO MUCH for family intervention and trying to get some kind of help from them for my guy. I think he is saddened that they dont want to help him or I and write us off. He is quiet tonight. He bought stuff for the kids lunches & cleared his habit out of the house for good. He apologized & said he will try. I dont think he can but im just being quiet so my kids do not have to hear us yell. I did come up with an idea to have my kids taken care of in az til i get there in a couple months and money to do so. I have money to take care of them but not my guy too. ...long story. anyways they can go swim and to movies and out to dinner & have fun in az for a couple months while i work 2 jobs and get money to get myself and all our stuff back to az safely. I have a good plan. I was steam cleaning carpets letting my mind wonder today and relax and it just came to me .. finally good. well im tired and a little wierded out abt the guy across the street and his life & what could of brought him to such a level of hopelessness and planning of his demise. I think the whole process he must of went thru is what im freaking out about, he truely thought that was an answer & that in this whole big world of ppl he didnt even 1 person to turn to , NOT ONE. poor guy. 
Im also freaked that he looked at me & then walked in the garage and did that. I was the last person he saw..........that sux...................

      I dont even know If I should post this. 
I love my nieghhbor ( as a friend ) but I dont want to end up like her & her husband when Im 60. They have been together for 43 years. I went to say hi to her today & repay her 5 lawn bags I used that were hers. She was in her living room cuddled w/her cats watching tv & he was in the basement tv room watching tv. It is only them home. They have kids & none were there on Easter. Thier 40 yo daughter lives 2 blocks away. She was home alone as well. I guess I do want a big loving family to share the holidays with. I want to be in my 60s and on the holiday or any other day just be able to have my lover put his hand on my shoulder & look at me & the love to be amazing between us. I dont think I will find a soulmate ( my guys stepmom is real & famous medium ) although supposdly I have him now. I was prophesized to him years b4 he ever met me. He had a hard time dating knowing those other girls were not me. When I met her she smiled & said "welcome to the family" ( like there you are ) I HATE IT.
I cry because I do not want him to be the one ! I want better..........
I dont want this to be it. She said when we turned 39 we would have homes internationally and he would be world reknowned. I just dont see it. I really just dont see it. If mediums get there info from angels of light ( that are evil ) of course she is getting the wrong info & it does explain my painful life since I met him. Ultimately bringing me down. I met my soulmate when I was 15 - at least at the time I saw him i recognized him ( like souls know each other ) i had his child 
11 years later. He wants nothing to do w/me because he had 4 other girlfriends and wants a players life. I didnt mind letting him go since I love our son so much _ I would rather have my wonderful son than a shallow player man like him. My son from him gave me the ability in this life to walk away from the dad & be truely done w/him in my mind.
Maybe that is why my son came. When my son was born he spoke irish & the father and I are of both irish decendant. My ancestors were from sterling castle ( in the movie braveheart ) .... I dont speak irish & my son has never met his father. The father had no desire to even after paternity tests I demanded proved it was his son. 
I think I am better off alone. Alone is not so bad. I could really handle being single for awhile & giving my mind a rest & just focusing on my kids, they are so wonderful ( all mothers say that ) :) .

      either someone hacked into my blog or blogger is having technical difficulties,, yesterday i looked at a blog too that was all about hacking into systems - which i discovered after i started reading it - i hope they dont have something in their blog that traced back to my blog & screwed mine up. I dont think that would be very nice. none of my april 10 blogs will post. I hope this is resolved by april 11.

      Im listening to the "Elizabeth" soundtrack. I really enjoy this instrumental cd & "The Passion of Christ" soundtrack as well. My friend cries when she listens to the P of C. I love P of C. I am also weepy but it is moving in a good way. Im supposed 2b at church now but I needed a moment of silence w/myself. My middle child wanted 2go 2part 3 of the church play ( tonight angels on wires float down from the ceiling). My smallest is across the street & my oldest is down the street... all happy this very moment. Im contemplating my actions from earlier today. I asked my guys family to intervene after 5 yrs into our life & HELP us. I dont know what we are going to do to help my guy BUT if he refuses HELP then they will help me & the kids leave.
Life is too unhealthy & dysfunctional no matter how hard I try to fake or protect our lives. MY guy must get help or be w/out us. I really think that it will be he will be w/o us in the end. I for 5 yrs have hid the problems. His sister said she already had a hunch but had pretty much tried to right him off in her life since she was faced w/no other choice. She will help me though, they are having a family meeting tonight w/out my guy to figure out a way to approach my guy. There  were 4 of them , 1 of them died (my guys brother) on the day we were moving from AZ to IL. noone could find us. We were right down the street in AZ when it happened & they were all there & didnt know where we were & didnt know we were on our way here (IL).
The brother that died drank himself to death in a storage room that he had made his bedroom while he rented out his huge house for money. The brother had a genius IQ as well. I think times are hard now & everyone is so over medicating themselves on what they can find. it is frightening. I wonder if my generation would of survived as pioneers. I doubt it. Soon I can blog what its like to live with someone who has to endure Rehab. I was smart of enuff to rehab myself so i didnt have to be locked up. I will now be able to put my kids & I in counseling so they can vent too & have positive outlets of peace as well. church is also that for us.....
Easter Bunny comes tonight , that is exciting for my kids. There is a huge Easter production ( service ) at the Paramount Theater here that we are supposed to go to tomorrow morning. My guy will be home & I dont know if my neighbors would apprectiate him going. I should make him go with the kids and I and let the neighbors go alone & let them have a peaceful Easter sunday. Tomorrow is such a special day for me being the day Jesus came back from the dead. He died to save us and im an example that he does save us. ...Even if we take a while to fully come around - I think it is a process we work on to be more like him & think what would he do. I used to think WWJD was so ridiculous & now I get it and what it is for. Im so moved by what I experienced  -  It is hard to put in words what he did for me. He came and got someone like me.... I owe it to him & the second chance he gave me to walk a straight line  &  not be deceived again by my past paths. I cant judge my guy because he has an addiction BUT I can create borders  around me that keep him out & me out of harms way. Im afraid he will go thru rehab & charm everyone & come out & go back to his old ways... he likes to lay around & in rehab he wont have to do crap.,, but withdrawal. Im glad I wont be around for that....IF he opts to not go to rehab I will be doing alot of packing and moving.

      My guy sleeps til 100pm(his day off) spends 3 hours on motorcylce ride supposdly looking for hardware store to rent lawn equiptment to trim the whole huge yard. He comes home- takes car goes somewhere & comes bk with trimmers & for abt an hour trims yard & leaves all the trimmings on the whole estate because its too dark to pick em up. He works tomorrow so they will sit all over all day tomorrow as well. He asks me if i want to come out in the dark & look at what hes done. I tell him "NO" & I tell him " I can come look & be aloof & look around like you do & like so what like you do" He said "oh is that what i do ?" yes , yes that is what he does... 
SO we got in a huge fight & he says to me " Try and find a job where you dont use your twat !" Im so dumbfounded from that comment !
I never USED my twat when I stripped & Im the one who chose to stop stripping & when I was stripping I didnt hear him complaining about all his sushi dinners & clothes & car( he couldnt handle taking care of i bought him) & everything else I paid for while him and his freinds sat on their lazy asses & played playstation like a bunch of kids ( in my house i paid the bills on ) some ppl are so ungrateful ! 
GEESH-  so he showers and leaves for hours & then comes home with a movie for the kids and I from the video store BUT never the whole day bought any groceries which is what we actually  need. Not a bunch of dumb videos ! Im sure he went out to eat & let us sit here.
I live with the worlds biggest LOSER. Im so disgusted. I wont speak to him..he said today " i dont understand how to do this ?" 
hes been with me for 5 years - what was lost in the translation in the last 5 years - did he get hit on the head and has amnesia ? He forgot to buy food ? what an idiot.......

      Look at stripping like this:
I once was the runway stripper that took all your dollars & I was that girl or girls you write about. You only know what I tell you and ACT OUT in front of you(im a great actress by the way). You fall for it. AND NOW after my stripping career is ceased by me-you get to read about all the damage you contributed to & the dysfunctional barbie that danced b4 you and all the little dirty truths that make your barbie such a dirty tarnished nasty girl that you really wouldnt want to be with anyways. I mean would you still want me outside of work while I shoved an 8 ball a day up my nose or the 6 long islands I also drank that nite or for every nite matter of fact? Barbie on outside , death on inside. I mean what does my liver look like? Ugly strippers dont make money-you gotta have it ( looks ) to make it,, AND I MADE IT   lets just say that. I had some very influential freinds I had to walk away from-patrons. I was so loaded BUT it is all gone because money made on vanity doesnt last. It is a rollercoaster that you want to get off but are hooked into staying on . It is hard almost impossible while you ride that rollercoaster 2 reach out and grab hold of the railing & stop that roller coaster. THAT is what it feels like for me , I have grabbed the railing & the ride has come to a complete stop. I was going so fast that I couldnt even see out the ride & now with my messed up windblown hair & smeared makeup & drool that crept down my chin , i look back up at that ride and say "whew" Can you 
picture it ? Dancefan, sometimes writes things like "unpracticed" he really thinks that they blow in his ear or melt into him because they in that tiny moment like him. That tiny actress moment is used on the next guy to & it IS practiced over & over every nite. WE WERE ACTRESSES &  the best bullshitters you will every meet. We had to actually carry on a conversation w/every walk of life. We were required to socialize more than dance. My customers had MONEY, 
money wont sit & listen to white trash, with the tooth missing and the unmatched outfit. I have thousands of dollars of costumes some
at $200.00 a pop.( frickin ball gowns like mrs america wears..)shoes that cost between $60.00-$100.00 or more. stripping is not cheap unless you are cheap and then you make no money looking cheap. . it is not a business to joke about. It is taxing mentally and physically. It is a vacumm on with no off switch. I hung out with the best (patrons) . I was at moments left to guard patrons money they carried on them totaling over $10,000.00. I lived a life that noone would ever believe was true. Dancefan to me seems as if he really believes that the girls moment alone w/him is real. IT is a fantasy , it is not real. If he wants to pay for fantasys well he can do so. I battle with the idea of stripping BECAUSE OUR SYSTEM does not help the single mom survive if her normal job leads her into poverty. I workded for AT&T  for 9 years when I walked out to strip. 9 years & I was not going anywhere there, moving up. I made alot of money BUT I had 3kids & bills & life to take care of. I didnt make enuff to do that.
I wasnt going to collect welfare so I decided to survive on my own instead of letting a man support me. I took my life into my own hands & thought this would be a safe ( locked in a club ) way to earn extra cash- the dangers that are around you in doing so though are consuming. ALL is made to seem glamorous & okay , I mean all the pretty thin glamour girls did cocaine SO was it really so bad NOT to mention the other names I cant begin to mention.. IT was a messed up world & im sure its now no better.......

      hhhmmm I must be delicate with this blog:
I went to "stripclubmemories" blog again to read his newest blog.
The last blog he mentioned a new visitor to his site he may of caused pain 2. Im sure he is talking about me. Im not in pain from reading his site. I was iritated at his story about him cheating with a stripper. 
WHICH is none of my business. We all blog what we want , that whats so great abt blogging. AND im not in a position to judge him or anyone else. SO i aplogize again. A commenter said i sounded 
"disgruntled" - hmm wrong word there. Im more in a withdraw. a pause from damage done 2to by me from being in the strip club industry. NOONE forced me 2take drugs , the pressure 2 be a skeleton w/no fat EVER & dancing in 8 inch platform heels on 6-8hr shifts was softened by the ability 2b able 2take drugs AND OH YEAH btw at the last club I worked at - management wanted you to drink(alcohol) because then the gentlemens bill was higher.( alcohol tab)
It is kinda hard to NOT drink while you work. It is an unhealthy trap.
Dang at one point we were to push champagne bottles on our VIP
customers & im sure that still stands at alot of clubs & I DONT want
to drink champagne myself BUT OF COURS if he orders it ya gotta have a glass. ,,,,,

      Thats what its like being in my head - the voices battling back. 
I keep thinking about posting photos on my site but I dont know if that is such a good idea w/ some of the things I talk about. I always tell the truth but some of it is controversial & do I really need ppl putting a name to my face ? I used to have this blog title 'I never LIE" because my life is so crazy noone would ever believe that it really happened. I have zero tolerance for liars,thats why my guy & I fight.
I really need to change the title of this site to "Who the heck am I ?
or "Who am I ?" but i really like the title although it doesnt really apply to my current lifestyle, it only worked while I was blogging my rockstar stories & now that I blogged as many I as I wanted I dont think the blogtitle really works now. "push pause" hehehehehe

      I went off on such a tangent in previous blog, I didnt get around 2the title of it.
I was deciding in my mind 2surrender 2life around me & become 1with it. I cant argue w/my guy & hes not going 2change so until I can make a move I can humble myself. I can just in so many words give up. I dont have 2take abuse but I can sit still & listen & listen 4what Im being given 2do next. I can not let anything bother me. I can accept hes not going 2come home. I can accept that our sex life is over because he doesnt come home ( boundaries set in place 4me by me) He can continue 2b him & I can continue 2find the ol good me & the even better new me & let him go downhill on all his own. I wil grow strong while he grows weak. I can watch his demise quietly. He will eventually just leave because his actions get no reaction & neither does he as a human because I dont accept him as the human he is being. I think he will just give up & go. OR something will happen where I can. I even thought of retaining a lawyer 2fight for the car & my rights , it would probably be 1 of those 1st time cases issues. set a precedent for women in the future. Im not even married 2the guy. I think though after 5 yrs it is as if we common law married although I dont think that exists here. 
I heard the word "anawah' spoken to me.. "be humble followers of jesus"
at the time I didnt know what it was. Im told it was the holy spirit talking to me  & I listened & accepted it. I didnt even know it was a real word or in the old testament .I find that amazing. I can sit here & keep my eyes on jesus & hope god changed my guy & if not god will find a way for me . It is so hard to sit & do nothing since all my life I never have. I always did it on my own never asking god for his help, I have to believe he will help me. I have to not care about the goings on of my guy because I cant change someone , I can only change me. Is that self - realization ? Will I end up in the wilderness or desert w/a backpack happy as can be being alone & one w/the universe ?
Is that was Sedona was all about for me ? Was I already self - realized and somehow lost it ? ,, now you get my name ....

      I love listening to my morning DJ. I love his topics & views & guests & his mind.I love the way I relate so closely to alot of what he says. 
He talked 2day abt "Power VS Force"( a book ). I need to get that book , I have bought so many books that I have my own library.
 
I have everything from new age to religion to self-help to psychology.   . When I died I was in the dark like I previously stated.  I yelled for Jesus to save me  & to come get me & THEN I came out of the dark & felt my body take its first breath. I have no way to prove that I actually died or instead had an out of body experience. I felt more sick and in pain being back in my body then when I was in the dark BECAUSE I wasnt in my poisoned body.
I was told I had been saved. I started learning about christianity after this happened. I dont deny that Jesus saved me or that the bible is true or that my prayers come true when I pray. 
I also at the same time understand the concept of good & evil & IF you look at the world as a whole that it could be as easy as good & evil battling. Its
either good or bad . Evil does deceive you & that is how it gets you. I am living proof of that. Im living proof of what christianity talks about. I CANT DENY THAT !   
BUT ,,, at the same time I also cant deny alot of other factors too. 
Maybe it was the way I was raised & I do need to rethink abt what I was led to believe as being false. Of course we think because we lived it , its all we know so it must be true.( sounds brainwashed to me )  I like to look at all avenues of theology and religion, I would love to go to the beginning & just try to piece it all together. I dont know why Im so hell bent on seeking the truth & consumed by it. I love the ancient artwork w/all the ufos painted & drawn into them. What happened? Did our ancestors have flying machines & where in time did they just stop being used or coming? & how does that tie into the bible and JESUS being god himself. Was jesus an alien? He is a heavenly being from the skies- a heavenly alien race- alien to us ! My family on my mothers side feels things, knows things, Im the same way too. I can open myself up and feel energy ( souls , ppl whatever u want to call it ) . 
I cant even explain how I do it. I have closed it off for months now because my christian friends told me they are demons & that if they are not in heaven then they are demons. I still have a hard time believing that one. BUT if evils job is to deceive you then I was deceived. I was told it made me feel special & that the devil can make you feel special too, give you stuff too, all in an attempt to get you any way he can. It is really easy simple when you think of life as a whole like that. Even the bible says a fool can enter in, like he made it so simple to get it why try and make it harder than it is. I read the bible & feel awesome ( im told it is the living word ) Im not saying there are religions that are wrong , I wouldnt know unless I learned every aspect of them myself & deduced they were wrong or wrong for me. If they cause harm I would say then that they are wrong. I want to know.... after the bible was written & completed was that it ? No more supernatural heavenly visits from jesus til he came again and that was when  the world turned to ruin & would choose to get the believers at a specific date. I then thank god I was saved but I dont want to be one of the seeds that gets led astray because Im curious & like to delve into all that exists out of curiousity for minds sake. (meaning theology & religion & new age) I hate that "new age" concept. What if the new age concept is the devils concept leading you away from god w/all these other great concepts & ideas that put you in control of your own destiny by opening yourself up to new ideas where you are a super human who can do things like meditate  & contact spirits BECAUSE you are using your higher self to do so .. aint that special. What if all new age is a lie ? I have a hard time with that because that was me & im not a bad person but its not abt being a bad person, its abt being DECEIVED. see that makes so much sense to me. 
I dont understand why I needed 20-30 other concepts or theories to just feel like I got it right. Did I really need to take a little of each concept to make up my own concepts or beliefs because I can ? 
Not one site in the Mormon Bible has ever been found! Archeological digs & expeditions uncover & discover sites in the King James version of the bible that actually exist.,, just go to Isreal. I was married to a Mormon & I wasnt even allowed 2know all the secrets of their religion unless I did what they said ( I suppose to brainwash me ) I actually would of had to leave him for a year & go thru some mormon training and learnings. I loved him so much I refused 2b away from him for a year. I didnt want to waste a whole year of my life w/o him to realize I already was devoted 2him. Im glad I didnt take that year away from him because he DIED . I was only with him for 1 year. I wasnt even married for a year , we were still newlyweds when he died. Isnt that just so sad. I would of lost that year of HIM to an idea ( mormonism ) that I would of realized was not for me & further more made no sense & then he would of been gone. I had to hide after he died & move because my husbands father wanted contact w/the baby I was carrying. I was 4 months pregnant when my husband died. I purposly lost contact w/him so that they could not brainwash my son into wanting 2become a mormon too. It has been 6 years & those ppl leave me alone & if so dont know where I am. I assume its too late anyways 4them to bother me now. I dont think they would try that hard anyways. My husband was what you call a "jack mormon"he did not fully engulf himself into it. He did give me a secret name
which I just let him do because it was his own thing. He used to call me 
"meredith". ( that seems so anceint & weird 2me now, 1 of my other lives)

you know i fantasize about being in my own adobe home, with the giant saltillo tiles ( that rust colored clay tiles) all over my home with big rugs thrown down on them , big comfy couches, big giant wooden medievel looking coffe tables and dining room tables - all over sized furniture that you can sink into to, lots of comfy blankets in baskets and thrown over the couch, like maybe some faux fur ones, sweater blankets , velvet blankets ETC. I want the walls adorned with my photography which is what I secretly want to do for a living. I want a big fireplace dug out of the adobe stone walls with a mantel ledge in front that you can actually sit on made out of stone too. I would snuggle into my couch with a glass of wine and blanket and just read.
Im such a simple girl... maybe have my cats there and my kids around me reading too. Kids are noisy ,,, there went the fantasy ! HEHE 
I was told that Im part blackfoot indian ,, maybe im having flashbacks of a former life and / or craving living that lifestyle.....but im part irish and german too so that doesnt sound like a great past in those aspects.

      "stripclubmemories" man replied to comments in my comments box. 
He was very polite. I suppose that his site just hit a little close to home for me. I hope that ppl in general do not think strippers lead glamorous fantasy lives. Strippers strip because of some financial need they are forced within their minds that is all there is left to do. Some strippers are totally all about the money and that goes for all avenues of their life ! you know what i mean by that - bling bling. Money made on vanity does not last. I only know 1 stripper that started a business with her money. 

My guy and I at this point are no longer speaking at least on my part.
He cant fight by himself & I feel theres nothing left to say that I have not already said & Im sick of the sound of my own voice repeating the same crap to him on a daily basis. Im exhausted from his ways. I know you cannot change a person Im only faced with the option of leaving him.  Im not gonna be that fool woman that sits home while her significant other is out and about. I know fools & I refuse to grow old unhappily like them. I even know some from my church. I dont think you should stay married for life if it brings out the worst in you and them.I am with the most selfish man on earth & I told him so. 
Im with a manipulator at its worst , so much so I dont even know who the real him is ! I suppose that the real him may be someone I really dont want to know. He trys to talk to me when Im unhappy with him & I am at the point where talking is useless. He makes me seem and feel like such a bitch. The only way this relationship would work is if I was submissive.Im a giver , hes a taker. I want to be a giver to a giver. I would do anything for my guy if he was worth it. I tried to do that for my guy for the first 4 years & he just kept taking and took all he can with nothing in return. Im not materialistic, I dont ever ask for anything other than the normals ( like bills being paid on time ). I clean the whole yard & house by myself always. My guy does NOTHING - he goes to work. I think he works really hard at work BUT I think he needs to a little bit around the house too. When I worked full time (my whole workable life from 16 and on) I did all that I did now too. If I had a job I would still do all I do now too. I want a teamplayer.....I want someone who thinks about a year from now - my guy thinks about tomorrow. At the rate he is going he will end up poor when he is trying to retire. I dont even know if he will ever be able to retire. PLUS what I am also shocking out about is that he is in the gym training thinking he can still dance ( strip ) and still has it at 35!!!!! I cant wait to see how fast he is rejected. He is addicted to the sexiness of it.. see how sad the industry really is !

      Im seriously contemplating leaving my guy and have told him so. Im so  disrespected & allowed myself to become trapped & controled out here in suburbia. I cant sit here while he works all day & goes 2the gym at nite. I cant sit here alone all the time. If im going to be alone I may as well be alone. I dont think my guy should of bought himself a gym membership when he isnt financially in a position to do so. PLUS according to ppl we know he hits on women in the gym ( another of our problems) . 
We are really past due breaking up...........
I am not working because we only have 1 car that I bought & he put the title in his name intially & it was supposed 2b transfered into my name and never was. He refuses to add my name to the title. 
I know Im dumb to stay & I have noone  to blame but myself. 
I allowed myself out of depression to become incapacitated and should of never done so being that Im a mother of 3. I had no business not working ( i have never not worked). Im a very strong indepenndant women /well I was til I met this guy and I let this man become my downfall. I now have to start over & figure out a way to get the heck out of here.
I refuse to strip ever again ( in an effort to acquire quick $ to leave him). 
Plus he said he wouldnt come home ever if i did & well he would have the car. 
He is verbally abusive to me and has me in a place I cant seem to escape. I pray god will soften him . I understand you reap what you sow. I got it. I can be humble but not abused verbally. 
I supported this man for 4 years. He would occasionally dance on weekends and make money but laid around literally all week in between while i did all else that was required. I should of left when I was making good money. I hoped he would change and should of realized that ppl dont change ( only i can change me ) I started stripping after I became widowed. I went abt it like it was a normal job and kept my head held high and was a good girl til the end when I got involved in drugs , I was burned out & had to have energy to dance. 
I was mad that I could no longer support my kids & I after having worked at AT&T for 9 years. I was mad at the world & went into survival mode ( stripping allowed me to survive ) My error was hooking up with the guy I have now who I always had hoped would grow up with me. 
I thought by now things would change, I learned the hard way they dont. I watched "Wonderland" last nite. It is the John C Holmes story.
I was so disgusted by it. My guy was offered a porno job for along time.
If he would of done it I would of left him. I think stripping is bad enuff.
I can tell you evil's job is to get you any way it can and it does.. Life is all about paths . 1 wrong path can kill you and so can alot of little wrong paths that lead to your ultimate demise. ( such as was w/me)
There is nothing glamorous abt stripping.  The behind the scenes of it is sad and disgusting. I dont care what other strippers have to say because I lived it and in many cities. Lines are crossed daily when you strip - do you tease(touch) this one or not ? I mean how many different men do you really want to risk touching ? It is a fantasy and that is all it is and that man at "stipclubmemories" took it beyond a fantasy and actually had sex w/a stripper & his wife doesnt know about it. I always said when I stripped I hoped I would never someday be that married woman at home wondering where my man was. My guy tells me he is late from work now & I of course automatically assume he is up to no good. Why wouldnt I ? Wrong paths ...... life is a series of paths , and it is all about which path you are going to take. 1 wrong path ruined my life. Im not bitter - Im honest. Stripping has become grossly mainstream & young women need better healthy choices. I would never allow or approve of my daughter stripping when she grows up. I would do everything possible to help her have a life filled with moral healthy choices. I have explained to her I made mistakes. I learned the wrong hard way. I dont want her to have to live thru those mistakes. I want her to go to college & invest her money wisely & be a self made millionare & to walk with jesus . I know there are alot of unexplained things that go on in the world BUT after having died I know jesus exists & you can be forgiven. I am in the process of trying to unteach my children any mistakes they may have learned from me. I only learned from my parents what not to do. I want to be their shining example of what to do right. I feel sad for that man at "stripclubmemories" that he has an obsession with strip clubs because life is too short to waste it on that. There is so much beauty in the world & so many positive things that can be done to make our world better. If theres money to be wasted at strip clubs theres money to feed a homeless family. I can say this because I lived in the stripclub world for years. I know the dangers and harms of it. I cant think of 1 thing positive that came out of it. I was a dedicated bodybuilder b4 I stripped. I was in amazing shape & nowadays Im just trying to survive day to day withdrawing from drugs that I still crave & money I still want to go earn. Im still in great shape but the damage drugs did to me cannot be determined. Im hopefully being spared of any such thing. I can honestly say and see the demise that my life took on. I can see it like a path that started out all bright and shiny and ended up dark and black and alone.. and that is what happened to me when I died. I can see the routes and paths  I took that beat me down and wore me out and brought me to the lowest point of my whole entire life. I know that this is not the case with all strippers. I also think that alot lie and hide the real truth of the damage that they go through because they fear noone will truely accept them when they are not able to dance anymore.

      I just read a blog called "stripclubmemories". I posted some rude
comments( not really my place to do so) He can blog whatever he wants such as I do. I was just so pissed to read his site & infuriated that he's married & posted a blog abt he cheated on his wife. In this day & age does safe sex really no longer exist. Does this man not realize he can catch Hepatitus from giving her oral sex?  I also think if your gonna cheat then just dont be married to begin with. I dont think he would appreciate his wife having sex with a male stripper if she went out of town ( unknowing what the male had exposed himself to!) omg that is just sick, really it is and so unfair to his wife to expose her to diseases.
I have previously explained I worked in as a stripper myself and it is degrading & alot of women do hook. I was in the group that did drugs and that is sad as well. I worked w/beautiful women & in one of the classiest clubs there are. Only a certain caliber of woman can even work there 2begin with BUT every single woman I associated with did drugs. I was friends with ALOT OF THEM.,,, and drugs were shared. I know alot of them hooked & that I never did. I would never do that. 
I should of just read that guys site and kept my mouth shut, expressing my opinion was a waste of time and just plain dumb.

      my guy and I had a huge fight the nite b4 last.
He walked up and screamed in my ear. I thought he was gonna hit me but he knows better. We are both extremely frustrated with life. We have been together for 5 years this summer & dont seem to be any better off than when we met. We are actually worse, but at least now we are trying to do this that are morally ethical. I dont think either of us would benefit to go back into the entertainment industry. I think we are both withdrawing from the concepts of it and the money that goes along with it ( the easy money )knowing " oh hey i can just go make a $100.00 tomorrow so no biggie I can spend $100.00 today( but we always made more than that) It is hard to let all that money go , but i also have to remember what i would have to go thru to get it. I would have to listen to someone i dont like talk in my ear all nite and pretend to be interested in their also boreing life & listen to them tell me how great i look and if i want to date them. ( nite after nite ) AND then they come back ! ( later in the week ) they always come back. In the end i had just made freinds with the few I actually did like and ended up hanging out with them til the sun came up and i had to take my kids to school - because of course we were all to wired to sleep - so we did the chicago party scenes, and of course i could nap while the kids were in school. WOW what a weird life that was. Im so lucky I never got in any kind of trouble EVER. I definately had a guardian angel protecting me, I was even pulled over by the police once drunk out of my mind and they let me go when they found out where i worked. (DUMB) 
SO anyways this fight was all about how i am losing my mind out here in suburbia with no car all day. I am going insane just sitting here doing the same stuff over and over. I pray something good happens soon - I think maybe god gave me this cooling off time - more time to read the bible and really get into it fully and research it like i want to . Im so restless that i get mad at myself for having to read it, yet when i do I really enjoy it and it does change my mind and the way i feel. ( of course it is the living word , it gives you a sound mind ) I have so much energy it is hard for me to just sit still and do it. I was at first totally absorbed by it but lately I cant sit here. I actually almost finished excavating my back yard yesterday. I filled 14 lawn bags of lawn debri
, undigging my backyard forest is a nightmare that is almost over. My guy is going to excavate the pond. I dont know when but im trying to go in the edges and help him undig it, it has a waterfall and landscaping.
i really do want to sit out there and listen to the rippling water. It has 3 years of growth over it. My crazy ex roommate that used to live with us moved out in november and he never in 3 years worked on the yard AND i guess he lives somewhere right around here because a neighbor saw him at the bus stop which means his car gave out. He is so odd. 
He used to have this "thing" about the water consumption when he lived with us and bitched about how much water we used ( freak ) and sometimes i go outside and my outdoor hose is running full blast  (someone turns it on as a joke) AND well now i know who it is. ..... especially since he is still in this neighborhood , i wonder who he moved in with since its only houses around here... strange. Im freezing so im going to go get warm...

      1: The Atkins diet , I do it without the bacon . I still do eat what i want sometimes but for the most part I try to stick to the protien concept. It is key also to keep your metabolism running at a constant rate which means eating a small meal like 3-4 hours apart ( maybe egg whites in between).You can even eat in the middle of the nite , your body starves overnite thus needing to find protien to run on using muscle mass.

2: Did you know you dont have to use detergent EVERY time you wash your clothes ? A small amount of detergent does not get rinsed out of the clothes during the wash cycles so you can actually skip soap sometimes, try it and you will see what i mean, the dirt will still come out. 

3: The concept up above is the same for your carpets in your home, try using super hot water once and no carpet cleaner and see how clean the carpets come and all the dirt that your able to pull out. It is called the browning effect , the soap actually browns the carpet after awhile. 

4: You can use newspaper to clean windows and mirrors and it is actually better than using window cleaner because the newspaper attracts lint particles and gets the surface super clean, just dampen the paper a little and wipe away. ( i love this one )  

5: The hot water no soap deal will work for the dishwasher as well as long as you are not the type of person who loads the dishwasher with food on the plates,anyways the water is so extremely hot inside the diswasher that NO GERMS could survive that tempature and dont think just because you didnt use dish detergent they wont come clean. 

6: Line the bottom of kitty litter containers with newspaper or garbage bags for easy clean up and less mess. Plus at farm and fleet stores for about $5.00 you can buy a giant( fill the trunk of a car) bag of tiny cedar type chips to use in the kitty container and it is just as absorbing as expensive kitty litter and this stuff lasts forever !   

I have tried all these and they work -

      I took an Iq test on www.tickle.com and well scored a 122 on their classic IQ test. I had some wine at the time so Im surprised I did that well. MY boyfreind previously tested at a genius level on a test in when he was in high school SO I asked him to take it and he scored a 131. I was given a pop up to look at which offered 8000 email smiley faces so I decided to look at it and download it , it was an extra email toolbar. I then found out the next day that they had put 30 spies on my computer and 7 on my hard drive. I realized also after we took the IQ test last nite that they added another one to my system.( SO dont use 
www.mywebsearch.com.) I was upset that they need to spy on what keystrokes i hit and what i do in my system. Im also upset because some spies can alter your internal settings and my email was compromised a few weeks ago to some sort of spy or hacker. I do email some pretty controversal stuff to ppl BUT its on the net to email so hey that is my freedom right to do so. 
I was amazed at my IQ score though,, it said i was a "Visual Mathemetician" which is what Albert Einstien was. (WOW)  I suppose that year of hard core partying didnt do too much damage. I also found this really cool article on www.newsmax.com that has a Dr Campbell link and talks about self cures and what he has come to find is really good or bad for you . I was amazed at what he had to say and I am seriously considering ordering more information from him. I can see why the pharmacutical businesses wouldnt want the public to learn of these secrets allowing us to do away with so many prescriptions that dont always do what they promise.

      I have had so many little lives inside my whole life.
I cant believe that i reincarnated for this, or did I ?
I dont even know who I am anymore. Today im going
to a christian church to see part 2 of a play for the 
Easter season. Tonight they hang him on the cross, I 
guess its pretty dramatic the way they show it, last
week they had horses in the church, my kids loved it.
Im sure it doesnt compare to "The Passion" which I 
still have not got to see. 
I really dont who I am , for part of my life I worked on
computers ( 9 years ) I was dating a boss. I then met
a mormon man and married him who was studying to 
be a DR and he was killed by a drunk driver. I then quit
my computer job and became a stripper and met a a man
that was one of the biggest fungi suppliers for mushroom 
spores in the world, we had a wild ride for 16 months. 
and then i met a male entertainer and well that brought 
me into the entertainment industry and i met alot of cool ppl
 from there and now that ride is ending,, hmm who am i ?

      I another time met Vince Neil of Motley Crue while i worked at that certain club in the city. I sat with him in VIP for hours, I suppose the club thought I was rocker enuff looking that he would like me and 
actually the minute we met he was caught off guard by me becuz i said "what did you do today ?" He said " im the lead singer of Motley Crue what do you mean what did I do today ? I gave a concert !"
I said "well I dont know, what do you want to talk about GEESH
I know who you are !" and then after that he said " no what i like you your cool , you can stay ( in VIP ) " ,,, i mean really who is supposed to impress who here.. anyways we had a great time drinking merlot and talking and he was an awesome person to get to know , at the end of the nite he wanted to know if i wanted to go the next day for dinner and get some merlot too. I said " well you know where i work if you ever want to see me again " and i walked away . I was kinda bummed becuz he was married at the time and had only been married for a year and he had impressed me and then he kinda let me down asking me that although who knows it could of ended up being totally innocent. 
I just decided i better keep my nose clean and not do it, he had said earlier that some girl had jumped in his limo and someone snapped a photo and he was pissed cuz he was married and that was bad publicity. Like i said "he was an awesome guy to talk to" AND check this out, while were in VIP talking we also can see big screen and surround tvs all over and his motley crue race car crashes,, i think he said it was like a million dollars or something like that ,and he said the concert he gave was not good & he was having a bad day. YIKES! see even rock stars have bad days,, PLUS you know ,, if i had ever went out with him or dated him i would of wanted Tommy Lee secretly all along AND i knew the girl that was seeing him and was on a cruise with him SO that was not going to happen . HAHA - what a weird life i have had. 
im a turn away from being some rockstars girlfreind, like 6 degress of seperation type thing.. like i can taste it but i have not met him yet.. 
oh maybe he will be a christian rockstar ? hmm is there such a thing?

      I guess Disturbed is holding bassist (?) tryouts. I hear about them alot since I live in IL and they are in Chicago...Heres another one of my dumb moments. When I worked at that really big club in Chicago I saw Dave ( lead singer ) come into the club  ONLY at the time I didnt know who he was ALTHOUGH I loved their music. Im not the sort of person to look in depth at the cd booklette or to watch Mtv for hours on end SO i had never seen the band, anyways one nite he came in and sat in a little VIP section & I liking his look which the way he dressed was the way I dressed when I wasnt at work brought me following at his heels and sitting next to him. I started talking to him STILL having no idea who he was THEN the DJ skips me and doesnt call me on stage BUT instead plays my music which was from the band Disturbed ( wa- aaaaaaa) you know the song 
HAHA, so I said to his freind ( daves) "I wonder why they skipped me , this is my music I dance to , matter of fact this is my favorite song. " AND Daves freind laughed and said "Cuz he sings it" pointing to Dave. I laughed like whatever and then Dave just looked at me & I realized that i could not get out of the moment and so I just said "OH" ( yikers ) Then i felt even more foolish becuz i really didnt know & didnt know if I should continue to sit with him or get up and leave ... THEN more of his freinds came in & Dave said to one of them,, SHE ( ME) is sitting here for free ( in a whisper ) and his new freind said " be glad' and more that i cant remember along the lines of me not wanting his money being a phoney and etc. ( like i was a nice person ) so I smiled and excused myself pretending not to hear and left * then MY friend walked by me and said "WA_ AAAA"
and we both laughed really hard. ( she could of told me GEESH ) 
so that was a big joke for awhile,,,  A few weeks later he came in again and i went up to him and explained and apologized becuz i really didnt know who he was and hoped i was not to much of a fool and that i was embarassed then, He said that he was glad I didnt know who he was and that i liked him simply becuz I like him , that meant more to him than if i would of known who he was ,, and you know what ,, i thought that was awesome. He invited me to stay at his table BUT I thought he was so HOT & I had a guy at home and 
well Dave was one of those to me that if had the chance i would of
done you know what if the matter would arise ( HEHE ) .. although i did dance for him the first time he came in and that was b4 i knew who he was ( JUST ONCE) and whew well hes just HOT. SOOOOO 
rather than put myself in one of those situations I politly said no thank you  .

(oh hahahaha) OKAY NOW I AM DRINKING WINE, ITS MIDNIGHT, IVE BEEN ON THIS FOR HOURS & WELL I DONT SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN VERY FAR.

I USED TO GET SO JEALOUS OF HIM AND HIS COMPUTER (BUT HEY I GET IT) IM A GEEK AT HEART I SUPPOSE. ONE TIME AT LIKE 100AM I HAD SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT TO TELL HIM ABOUT SEDONA, AZ AND WELL I ATTEMPTED TO THROW A PEBBLE AT HIS COMPUTER ROOM WINDOW & (IN MY BUZZED-NESS )THE LITTLE TINY ROCK SLIPPED OUT OF MY HAND & LANDED STRAIGHT AHEAD ON HIS BACK GLASS SLIDING PATIO DOOR & THEN I PROCEEDED TO WATCH THE WHOLE DOOR SHATTER INTO A MILLION PIECES & REMAIN STILL IN ITS FRAME - JUST LIKE OUT OF A BUGSY BUNNY CARTOON- YOU COULD SEE MY HEAD FOLLOWING EACH CRACK AS IT MADE ITS WAY THRU THE GLASS . YIKES ,, SO I RAN AROUND THE COMPLEX TO HIS FRONT DOOR AND RANG THE DOORBELL , HE FINALLY CAME DOWNSTAIRS & ANSWERED THE DOOR - I SADLY BEGAN TO EXPLAIN TO HIM WHAT I HAD ACCIDENTLY DONE TO HIS BACK PATIO DOOR.  HE SAID TO ME "UH WHY DIDNT YOU  JUST RING THE DOORBELL IN THE FIRST PLACE !" DANG GOOD QUESTION (HUH) hahahahahahaha NOW REMEMBER WE LIVED IN AZ SO IT WAS LIKE 120 DEGREES OUTSIDE , LITERALLY !

      Im coming to terms with my past 4 years of life and the drug addiction and the reasons behind it. I have realized that the drugs in an odd kinda way continued me on a "hi" even though I wasnt on one anymore. It allowed me to connect to the "hi" I used to feel by being someone , even if the someone was really noone. I mean at the time I was someone with a stage name and small following in a world that only existed in that realm.  I have been seeing how going from the limelight to no lights can affect your sense of self and who you are or what you thought you had become. I used to think I was someone even though it was really noone important. Im glad now that that part of my life is over & Im back to being noone and can work on the real me now and not the stage fake me........
I see how evil ( being drawn into it ) affected me and others and still does. I can recognize its look and pull now............

      "J" just came home with 2 freinds from a motorcycle run , he ran for Harley. "J" works for Harley and on the way back one of his freinds crashed & had to be driven home on the back of another bike to here. I was sitting here not knowing where they were and attempting to not wonder what "J" was up to. I didnt know they had a run tonight. The one that got hurt is a "J" also ( exactly ) and had something I used to really like on him. I cant believe how I easily thought to myself for one second that yeah I could partake for a moment since it has been so long & that would be it fore me ( like just this once )  BUT I didnt. I was strong BUT it makes me so mad that at moments I can feel so weak. I have to always and forever just keep saying no. I thought a little was okay for me to partake in b4 I died and had my NDE. Im glad I had a NDE because it makes me realize even a little is not okay....plus I used to do alot not a little. I hate that he "J" is around this other "J" if he has that on him because I know how easy my "J" might occasionally MAYBE say okay... its not really his idea of fun though. I dont want us to be around those types of influences since Im not anymore and I want us to have better. This other "J" was drinking b4 he crashed although to me I could tell he was doing more than that unless he is really mentally messed up from the wreck , cuz he was all over the place. All of them now are back trying to find the motorcycle where the other "J" wrecked at with a truck to tow it. I dont like my "J" there in case the cops are waiting for them to come back. My "J" siad a silver car called the police and they were coming as they left...after my NDE I was shocked that all I didnt want to believe could be true about good and evil. I have been deprogramming myself from the beleifs I grew up beleiving that were my own. Im glad when I called for Jesus he gave me life back. I dont want to mess up this second chance I have been given. Im on a fine line and my NDE is fresh so I have to really play good cop bad cop with myself to stay strong and avoid past patterns. I threw away a bunch of new age stuff I had because I dont want to live a lie anymore and I want to show Jesus that I know he is the way. I dont need all the new age theories I once had that never gave me peace. I read my bible & it makes me thirsty inside for me and that is because it is real... and nothing new age ever did that and filled me inside as well. I can actually feel the presence inside me now. I lived a lie for 34 years - I wish I would of found Jesus sooner. I guess I had to go into the dark to find the light.

      www.mancow.com has the real video of Nick Berg being beheaded and I just watched it. I watched it becuase as far as im concerned he was an American just like me & he shouldnt have to suffer alone. I suffer now too after seeing that , noone should have to suffer alone.... I think we should all see it and be aware of the level of evil that does exist in the world in order to better protect ourselves. I figure an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth , we will never find them but if we do their heads should be SAWED off in the same manner his was. His death was not a quick he didnt know what was happening kind of death but a horrible slow sawing off his head with a big knife kinda death. How is Nick Bergs life justified in their eyes. I wonder what belief that went with , ALLAH would tell them to cut off a mans head that was traveling thru the country not harming them or anyone else. I dont understand the reasoning for this being done ? I dont think what was done to the iraqi prisoners was right, and I do think ppl have to answer for their actions for tormenting others BUT nick Berg did not do anything to anyone did he......that would of ever made that OK ? The video is graphic and fills me with overwhelming saddness. I am saddened by the prisoners of Iraq being abused as well, all is human suffering, and human suffering solves nothing EVER. I thought we were in Iraq to restore order not create chaos ? It is not a humans job to abuse or judge or punish or hurt another human , isnt it gods job to handle these types of situations, i mean "what would jesus do?" .....

      I at one time in my life was a follower of James Van Praagh. I hung on every word that he said and believed. I want to know why I did that. I want to know why I idolized him so. I have been what you would call spiritual or a new ager all my life. I am not that way anymore. I am new but the world and the ways of the world are not new. Did I think I was being open minded by saying and being that way ? Was I accomplishing anything truely spiritual. I learned to meditate & contact a spirit or so it came to me. I learned to photograph spirits & see them in photos. I want to know who these spirits are & why they are not in heaven & did they choose to just appear for a bit and then go to heaven , or is heaven here and they are intermingled with us ? I asked a million questions on James Van Praaghs site & never got one of em answered. I sent in my photos of spirits I took for their photo gallery & never had one posted AND my photos are real.  I never even had 1 email answered as to why the pictures couldnt be posted. I was always told by other operators that the website manager was too busy BUT I noticed she is not too busy to post photos of herself in the photo gallery. I want to know why the spirits that talk to James dont talk about what level of heaven they are in ( according to the levels ). Isnt heaven just heaven ? I have been back and forth with all this for years and years and it just doesnt make any sense to me. I mean my gosh how long has James Van Praagh been talking to the dead & thats all hes got to say. I would ask more if I was him. I was shocked when James Van Praagh said on the radio here "dont get me started about the bible, that was written by man". I wonder why James Van Praagh decided to not become a priest after all those years of studying. I myself can not account for alot of things that go on this world as well but I just think he should of gave more. I do now believe that angels of dark can masquerade as angels of light. I am swaying toward believing that those are dark souls fooling him. If you spend so much time in different avenues of new age-ism's and not on god arent they all just really a distraction and isnt that a sign of the wrong kind of spiritual awakening. Isnt that more like the awakening of an anti-christ type.  I mean how many new age type things can 1 person possbily be into,, theres thousands. I am starting to think it is all just a big distraction, it certainly distracted me.... til I died. I have a hard time deprogramming myself from the way I was raised & what I believed ( so open minded spiritually ) I know that after I died my eyes started to open & I saw good & evil and evil where I didnt think it was evil b4 ( shocking me )I was shocked and still am at how subtely evil has slipped in & become normal where it once wasnt. If I wouldnt of died I would still be on the wrong path. I never got peace from the path I was on because I was still searching even though I was doing peaceful spiritual things ( but in the name of what and without even realizing it and that is the deception ) It is hard to deprogram myself , sometimes I want to cry because some of the things I did I like. Yoga is an example, ppl hate that one, Im in the process of getting ready to get rid of my yoga stuff. I can still stretch. Yoga poses have specific meanings that are in praise of the divine BUT what divine ? Yoga is associated with the Hindu religion and anyone can do searches on the net and see all that yoga is attached to spiritually. I just sit here and look at my yoga books and cards & know how amazing it makes me feel to do yoga but can one do it like i do and not acknowledge that the poses have spiritual meaning and what are you awakening. I want to know why Yoga has taken off so big NOW and never b4. I would think something so amazing would have been spread like it is b4 now. I am aware of the Spiritual Awakening that is taking place now ( i have a relative that is a medium so I know all about it ). I wonder where she gets her info from ( exactly who spiritually ) .. oh its just all so complicated. I mean can i really be so into Jesus and still acknowledge all else that is going on  & how does he tie into all this new agie tpye spiritual stuff?

      I wonder who those iraqi prisoners were specifically that would make American military personnal so outraged to abuse them so... the way they did and photographed them .... I dont think it makes it right regardless of who they were. I understand that it is WAR but we only become what we despise by sinking to that level. I dont think 2 wrongs made a right. I also wonder if Nick Berg would of been beheaded anyways & the iraqi prison abuse just became their excuse ( as they worded their reasons why ). I think it is all just sad. It is escalating & I wonder where it will end ? I dont understand the reasons for Bush allowing still the billions of dollars that are being sent to rebuild Irag. I understand the damage we did should be fixed BUT isnt the amount being sent just a little high ? It seems to me that there are alterior motives to all this. Saddam is caught now...but we are still there and so doesnt Irag have men that are skilled to rebuild ? I dont think any amount of money would entice me to leave my family to go into hell with the notion of maybe being kidnapped and tortured. I read an article about the a draft maybe coming for women. How many Americans can possibly be drafted and who will care for our children left behind ?

says on floor 80 there was an office called "TheBeast.com" it offered computer services. I looked up this website and got this website instead immediatly in my url field   -  http://www.thebeast.com/Citrix/MetaFrameXP/default/login.asp?ClientDetection=on ................... It then asked me for my login and password. 
In Brussels there is a computer called The Beast - It is creating a number for each person in the world that they will be identified with to purchase goods. We will all be given a number - sounds like a one world type of currency to me as well........ 
http://216.10.26.55/ talks of this computer as well. Remember in the bible it says the gate to destruction is wide and the gate for life is narrow................ you decide. Just go look at the sites,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      I have thought about deleting this blog and starting over or not having one at all. I feel like now that i blogged all my baggage and did undo name dropping that Im over it all and have been ready to move on. I probably should of wrote a personal journal (not on the net) BUT this is who i am and im not ashamed of it. Im going to blog some websites previous and forward that I find interesting. I hope becuz of my brutual honesty about my past(testimony) and life as i led it that the websites I post to be viewed will not be taken as that of a crazy conspiracy theorist .  I think most of the rumors we here are TRUTH. I think we are being desensitized by the media. You here anything enough and it becomes routine and you have already processed your beliefs towards a topic and then the more you hear the topic the more your mind passes over it and thinks "next" . It seems to me that it is brainwashing in a sense.  My blog really has no theme or point other than me just existing , my life as I lead and have led it and what I come to realize on the way. I seem to have taken the long way to get here................

      I havent been blogging, I have been too busy reading. I wanted to relate some of the information I have found and see what others think. I can only speak from my personal experiences since it is all i know. I have spaces of time that i am missing from when i was young. I KNOW i was not molested , I do think something very supernatural happened to me since I was so openminded but what happened specifically I dont know. I know what I remember but it doesnt make any sense and how do i know if those are my thoughts or thoughts I was imprinted to remember? 
I experienced stuff so bizarre THAT my mind can conceive the fact that the possibility of being imprinted with thoughts that are not mine ( memories) actually makes sense to me. I like to look at conspiracy sites and theories and the unkown ( ufos etc ) since I have seen them in AZ. I consider myself to be fairly inteligent ( iq of a visual mathematician , which is what Einstien was ) ..... BUT I have no real explanation for some memories that I can and cant remember( lost time ) I when i was younger had a HUGE fear of being left alone. I didnt know why but at the time thought in my past life i had been killed or cut. I wonder know if I was repressing memories of being taken and cut and the time this was actually going on ? I dont have any memories of being abducted but weird memories that make no sense when I was lost in those moments of time which were viewed by my parents................

       urlLink    This photo was taken by me last summer before I had my near death experience. I used to then think it was Jesus BUT i dont know anymore. I know it is not me. I took this photo for an Ebay account I had but decided not to use it because of the spirit I circled.. that spirit at the time would of actually been behind me over my shoulder. I dont have any idea who it is or why its there but there is also a man in the back against the wall.. I will download the picture of him next as soon as i find it...

      These photos I took are of the weather yesterday at my home. My son who is 8 said to me " too bad you dont know how to put in the wizard of oz music along with these photos. " He said the photos looked like we live in Kansas,, smart kid for 8. You can see from the intensity of these storms WHY I like to photograph them. Please take a moment to click on these thumbnails to enlarge them to see the real intensity of these clouds.. thanks for looking.

"They destroy community character, they create urban sprawl;and leave behind ugly,unused hulks ( 371 stores stand empty currently) as business stragies shift." 
I use the Walmart a few minutes away ONLY because of the low prices and low prices mean alot to me having 5 ppl in my immediate family. I didn't know the chaos Walmart creates by causing nearby businesses to suffer financially. I do cringe when its time for my Walmart trip becuase I always find the store is messy and crowded and sometimes seems as if eveyone from a 3rd world country works and or shops there. I really have no room to talk I always tell myself being I shop there too. I think times are hard ( unless your a millionaire which seems to be 1 in 125 now ) now or at least I just personally notice everyone else besides myself now...

      "J" is getting increasingly more abusive verbally and I think it is coming to a moment in my life where I may have to sell all I have and leave.  I really dont want to do this BUT for how long do I pray that he will change ? Im becoming scared of him now so I think prayers are beyond me. I feel like I live with the enemy. Today is a bad day and my freind "P" I talk to is at work . I wont bother her there..... "J" broke a window on monday when I asked him to help me move a love seat to our family room in the basement ( which I could of moved by myself ). He became upset when his dog wouldnt stay out from under his feet so he threw the loveseat and broke the window in the backdoor. It was of course my fault because I didnt jump right in and help him while he was freaking out and screaming at the loveseat, me and the dog. Why do men get so angry when its time to move furniture ? ... well this was monday and today is worse. "J" came home from on his way to work & screamed at me that im the "C" word because I still had the bankcard from grocery shopping & the car is on "E" ,, which is how he gave it to me .... SO he left it on "E" . I only drove it down the block once in the past 3 days. The card is useless to me because I dont even have the car today so where am I gonna use the bankcard at ? I dont even spend money like that anyways.... I save our money. "J" sleeps til the last second he can and daily leaves himself no time to get ready or get to work. It doesnt matter how much I try to encourage and or advise or help him on getting to work on time ( I held a job for 9 years and quit with a perfect clean file , never a black mark against me ) ..... He doesnt listen to anyone and he thinks the world is against him and doesnt take into account that everyone works and few like their jobs. I was told how much he truely really does hate me & on that note he walked in the kitchen and stabbed a knife into our wooden kitchen counter and left it there .... a few minutes later he called me from my cell phone and asked me what i planned on doing since this is my fault he is late for work. (while he was home, he called his work and told them his "C" girlfreind took his card and left the car on "E" and this was my fault.) "J'a" work doesnt know he drove it home sunday on "E" and left it there til work today. (besides me driving it down the street and back once ) .....My son and his freind are here ( he was scaring them ) and I told him to calm down because of them ( and many other reasons ) and he said he didnt care,,,,
He wanted me to actually call his work and take the blame for all this becasue my not reacting and staying calm was freaking him out even more....

      Reading some of my archives really helped me put some of my life into perspective, I was complaining about "J" in march, Ive been unhappy for awhile and had hopes of things looking up but even then I was miserable with "J" so what was I hoping for ? Its almost August - almost 5 complete months of being sad. I could of had this done and over with and been on the road to emotional recovery by now. I know blogging all this helps me work out in my mind what has to be done. Im glad I looked at the archives, I can see how messed up and sad I was and remember that then I was way worse off mentally than I am now. I am getting stronger and I have quit drinking and Im a vegetarian now and feeling and looking so healthy and over time rebuilding myself to who I once was. I dont feel any negative entities weighing me down anymore, im not being oppressed. I just know that "J" has proven he has no desire to change and he wont change and happiness is what I need even if its without him.. I want to be in love someday , I want to be in deep eye locking love... I know though that the longer I wait and keep on my positive mental path the better stable person I will be and have no baggage to offend or hurt anyone with my crippling relationship problems im enduring now. Im lighter now than I was when I started this blog so that is good,, im getting stronger,,

      I went to church tonight, which is good, because I really needed the positive environment. I am heart broken that I tell "J" I want to break up and his only reply or actions say "OK". Why in the hell was he even here to begin with ? I mean if its so easy to just break up then what the hell was all this about ? Im so burnt out on crappy relationships I cant even imagine playing the dating game. I cant imagine getting to know someone or vise versa and even bothering to want to tell them about myself and or caring for that matter. I cant trust ppl so Im sure it will be a very long time b4 I ever hook up again and thats sad at 35 being so burned from this relationship. I had to tell "J" off tonight because he kept talking to me about his motorcylce,, LIKE I CARE ! "J" is so selfish that its like he doesnt "GET" that were breaking up and that I asked him to move out,, its like he still wants to talk and be freinds and for what ? why ? so he can trip my 6yo again on purpose and tell him "thats how life is sometimes" again,, I mean that right there keeps my fueled to never let him spin me into his twisted manipulating web again,, one of his freinds told me when he met me, that they had to leave az where we all met and go bk to chicago and that "J" said he would just sit in the sand and weave his web of mojo and I would take him in to live with me and what sickens me is that i did .. cuz i loved him not cuz of some mojo spell crap. Im a christian now and its very trying to pray for him and not judge him and tolerate him until this over, I dont seek revenge on him and I know god protects his children .. one time after i was born again "J" said to me,, " Ive already ignored one of my freinds when they started talking that crap!" oh thats right i forgot if it doesnt involve a porno or pot then "J" aint hearing it,, he amused me a couple times and rented some movies about christ BUT I shoulda realized it was all part of his sinister plot to do whatever he wants to do to my mind and keep me in the web a bit more,, It is a horrible feeling to have someone just give up on you and not try and just take up space and talk about themselves constantly like the world doesnt exist outside of himself.... He asked my kids to go outside to see his freshly painted motorcycle,, LIKE WE CARE ?! Today my 6yo said to him " I love you" and "J" just walked away and never came home all nite,, I WANT TO HATE HIM,, the nites are hardest on me. I keep telling myself it will all be ok soon, just keep going to church and stay around positive ppl. I snuggle in the living room with my boys and we fall asleep to cartoons. all this talk of moving and breaking up can be trying on kids and im trying to create a loving environment for them regardless of "J" s selfishness and ignorance of all else except himself..... this is an example of "J" at 1130pm - "did you eat dinner , whats for dinner ,, oh you didnt eat , well lets go to taco bell ( knowing full well my kids wont eat that ) .." and that we didnt eat dinner cuz we were at church and cause i have to delegate what is left to eat in this house til i get my child support at the end of this month cuz im the brilliant girl who thought her boyfreind would love her and support her for one year since i supported him FOR FOUR YEARS.. its like i gotta keep asking to use his money to buy groceries SINCE I used mine to pay bills and he just sickens me because i shouldnt even have to ask,, he should just buy groceries like any normal human being would,, hes missing basic human being skills and social skills and its not that he doesnt have em, its that he is selfish and could give a crap... I want to hate him, its so hard not to ... I just wish he would go already ,, I looked at jobs today,, Im so nervous to have a normal one and be out there in the workforce again,, but I am a hard worker, just very emotionally guarded now on letting anyone in,, I have a hard long road ahead of me.......... but the nights are the longest, the nights kill me mentally ,, I have stopped crying myself to sleep because hes not worth it ,, run on sentences, fast typer , what can i say,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      Just to clarify,, "J" doesnt support me financially. I receive death benefits and child support, this past year is the first year of my life I have used them or counted on them for our well being meaning the kids and I . I pay half the rent and a good share of all else as well. Just because "J" works doesnt mean sometimes he makes enough to pay all the bills.&nbsp; Hes paid based on commissions.

      It turns out the keys were in the trunk of the &nbsp;Cadilac and it cost "J" almost $400.00 because hes such a genius and broke into the car and did god knows what to the ignition. I could of paid $130.00 and been done with it and thats with getting the keys back. I called my daughter whose on vacation in AZ to talk to her and "J" took the phone and hung it up and said "i dont care if she dies" and walked away from me ( shes 11 ). "J" s comment about my daughter sealed it in my mind that I have to leave him.&nbsp; I had nitemares last night about my moving out plans. I dont know what is wrong with me in regards to this being so hard to do. I for one should of never stopped working, I should of stopped dancing BUT right away found something else to do. My not working was much needed and gave me time to get closer to god BUT I hope god keeps me safe and my kids safe til I am working again soon. Im not codependant , I can live alone and have. I think my problem is that I hate it when they stop caring. It doesnt make me less of a person , or them less of a person , we just always hope the other person will always care like they did when we first met. I gave up on "J" once before after we had been together for over 3 years and I was going to leave him then. I should of left him then. I asked him to move out and then move back in and he did. I dont know why he doesnt care about anything ,, maybe cause all his life noone cared about him BUT I do everything for him and have .. wasnt that enough to make him come around ? I did everything - now I do what I do cause its not about what he doesnt do , its about what i do and that Im a good person and no matter what I always do my best , even if it isnt appreciated. I can still do my best alone. I wont know what its like to be in a normal relationship - if&nbsp;I &nbsp;ever even get that chance again.. I wont know what its like to be with a guy that knows how to do his own laundry or go to the store and buy groceries or want to mow the lawn&nbsp;because he takes pride in what he has.&nbsp; I asked "J" on wednesday why he didnt come home til 330am if her last dance show was at midnite, he said " what do you care ?" I said "because on saturday nite we werent broken up like we are now" ................

      "J" didnt come home on Saturday night til 330am , and with an attitude too. I wasnt ready to get into a big converstaion so he said " Should I just leave now?" I said "If you want to." ... The next day I realized I had locked my keys in the trunk of the Cadilac on Saturday night after I had gone to buy my freind in a nursing home some pajamas. "J" said im a stupid loser , a stupid loser thats not working ( although I supported his butt for 4 years while he only danced on weekends and did nothing else, Im mean didnt clean house or move his butt off the couch to do anything!) I was waiting for school to start in 30 days so we could save on childcare costs, Im not working to pay a daycare. PLUS i have never not worked my whole life TIL NOW. I know he cannot say the same...ANYWAYS&nbsp; "J" keeps saying "what if the keys are not in the trunk."
I drove the car home, I then cleaned the whole house, I only keep my keys in the silver tray or in my bag. I shut the trunk that night after I came back from the store and have not seen em since AND I have really looked all over. "J" says on Sunday "Im gonna go f'up the Cadilac now." trying to break into it that is. I dont know what thats suppose to prove. I didnt realize I can never make a mistake. I had told him evil money gets blown into the wind and that he was earning evil money on Saturday nite so "J" thinks I locked em in the trunk on&nbsp;purpose. I didnt...
&nbsp;"J" breaks into the car and ruins the ignition and is now finding&nbsp;out how much damage he caused the car breaking into it INSTEAD of just calling a locksmith to start with. "J" bought the car for me BUT its in his name. Monday on the floor I found a waded up piece of paper that I picked up and opened and realized was a gas receipt for Saturday nite at 230am in a town 30 minutes away, the dancers last show was at midnite here in my town SO why was he at 230am in&nbsp;a town 30 minutes away. This dancer left her jeans and wet towel in the trunk of the car , shes so skinny the jeans would fit my arm. "J" came home looking for a fight and well it seems he got one didnt he. Today Tuesday as hes leaving for work , he says he cant find his keys _ I knew they were in the silver key tray but I let him squirm ,so he looks in the silver tray mumbles and walks off , THEN he comes back to me and says "they were in your purse!" and leaves.. This man is actually trying to make me think im going crazy BUT&nbsp;I &nbsp;never use his keys, touch his keys or would. I have my own set to the other car... I knew where his keys were cuz I saw' em when I cleaned the kitchen last night. My friends told me "GET OUT " of here. ..
He is unpredictable and thats scarey and thats how it all starts - you hear it all the time - "well there were little signs but he was a nice guy" ,,"really he was" ,,,,

      Im too young to be a woman in her home , withdrawn , with her kids and her cats.. aaaccckkk. I have 4 cats ,, hmm is that too many ? I also have a squirrel that I let go and she visits me everyday, or well I visit her. I got her because she was injured so I took her in til she healed and then I let her out thru a hole in the screen on the window ,, at first she could come and go BUT mainly she likes to stay outside . "J" picks her up sometimes and brings her in, but since hes been working so much lately ( cough , cough , yeah working thats it ) he's not here to see her and bring her in when shes around.&nbsp; I sit at the bottom of the tree and feed her bananas and sunflower seeds.. she trusts me, its nice, today she was annoyed cuz it was windy and she seemed on alert and once she put her little paws on my hand as if to hang on, I LOVE MY SQUIRREL .. I had a male for like 9 months but it was bad cuz he really wanted to go outside BUT it was winter &amp; he was a baby when I had him crawl into my hand and I raised him from a tiny baby to his adult size. I felt bad cuz all winter he would run in the house from window to window like on crack and look outside and run up to me with this look on his face like " can I ? " 
go outside that is , this would go on for hours til he was exhuasted and would lay on my leg or on the arm of the couch or in my shirt and pass out and then he would awake and try again. I finally had to let him go once it was warm enough, a few days later it snowed and I cried. I hope he knew how to build a nest,, I dont see him anymore.. BUT this one ,, she comes back everyday and it is awesome... I love animals .. sometimes she hangs upside down on the tree and swings her 2 front paws out to me and I kiss her nose,, aahh sigh , animals rock.. "J" stinks.. next life I want "J" to be a squirrel ... hehehehehehehe

      okay&nbsp; first of all like i was saying other ppl are my problem .. for examply "J" is my problem... 
"J" calls me from work and asks me today if it would be okay if he tonight was a driver for a girl that had to bartend at a party in chicago.&nbsp; "J" tells me the agency called him and asked him to do this, the same agency he used to dance for , yes ladies he used to be a dancer , stripper , whatever you want to call it.. SOOOOO anyways .. I ask him " uh how did the agency call you since your at work , what did they do call your work ?" and of course &nbsp;he says "YES" . Im told by "J" that this girl has to bartend for 2 hours at this event at this bar in the city and that he would really like the extra cash, even though right now we are fine with cash. "J" also manipulating adds how he wants to get up early and go to church tomorrow morning with me. Im not in the mood to fight or being distrustful, things between us are calm now, so I say its fine and I actually dont give him a hard time, I play cool girlfriend and leave it up to him,,, well ladies he got off work at 600pm- its 202am and "J" hasnt called or come home.. so lets all say in unison " IM AN IDIOT !" he either got laid or got laid ,, and thats it in a nutshell.. there is no way in hell he can walk in this house and come up w/any insane story that will justify this . "J" has Sunday off and wanted me to follow him to pick up a car that his friend is just giving him for free.. uh yeah like im gonna take him to do shit tomorrow. I even said to him on the phone " you are going back into the world we left and be aware of what evil entices you to cause a rift between us becuase something will surely arise going into the bar scenes in Chicago and driving this girl there and back and plus if shes a hottie you have to be on your best behaviour!" okay ladies so what do we say again "IM AND IDIOT".&nbsp; I cannot change the ppl around me , I can only change myself, I can forgive ppl of what they have done to me and would like the same BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS. Im a new christian and "J" knows it and this is just disrespectful. Im not stripping anymore or hanging out with my ex stripper girlfriends OR going out at all for that matter ! I wish you could all be here for "J" walks thru the door.. JERK - the best reaction really though is no reaction and secret and silent planning and packing to leave his loser jerk butt...

      Today I found my Bionic Woman Doll, she is in great shape i might add with all her clothes and shoes on. I also found my letter from "Paul Westerberg" formerly of The Replacements. I had met him when I was in my 20's  and lived in AZ. I still have his letter addressed to my home - I should be suprised at the fact that he saved my address, thought of me and took the time to write me. I always said I was one step away from being some rock stars girlfreind. Ive met some of the best of them. I have walked away realizing that in the end we are all just ppl , we are all the same, we all go down different paths but in the end we really are the same and we really are no different. We all get bored, we all get happy , we all go to eat and see movies and sit around wondering what are we gonna do today ... theres really no difference. There is a website out , Donnas long and short of it, that tells about rock stars sex lives. I think its sick that they  know enough about them all to make a web site. I can honestly say I never slept with one of em, what would of been the point ? Is that something you really want to brag about IF that paticular one cheapens the idea of sex anyways, just to be a notch on the belt loop, no thank you...

I have been thinking about becoming a vegetarian again. I tried it once, it wasnt so bad but im heavily into protien which means lots of chicken and egg whites. I looked at this website and found out that animals that are too sick to stand will lie for hours or days without medical attention and then are pushed with tractors and forklifts into trucks to become our food. This website is a must read. ( at least beer isnt meat,,,, :) )

      I have a cadillac now. I have not driven it yet. I really dont have anywhere to go right now. Im relaxing painting my kitchen with merlot(that is the color i chose) paint. I love it ...I have been on the internet looking at medical pictures of ppls insides after cancer has attacked them and some of the photos were from alcoholics. I think I just found my way to quit drinking.. lately I have been drinking more than I want to . I keep telling myself I will stop and then at the end of the day I tell myself its okay one drink is no big deal.. but its never just one. I also and I dont know why after a couple drinks wake up and cant sleep and or fall asleep at all. I have been attempting to get myself back into the gym full time as "J" has been and offered to enroll me also , now that I have the cadillac I can go whenever I want. I have started going back to church and on wednesdays listen to a motivational speaker there. I like it. I also have not given up on the ideas of the books that were banned from the bible and the stories they tell. I just find religion very interesting. I also belong to a para normal site and post pictures there as well. I love all the stories about the artifacts that shouldnt of existed when they did like the batteries found in the pyramids etc. I stil have not see " The Passion " . I will rent it when it comes out on dvd next month. I was saved right before the movie became a fuss. I had a nde and couldnt even mention jesus name for a while without crying. I couldnt of seen the movie about him ,,I couldnt of handled it then. I think I can now.

      My neighbors took my kid to a bar ( how kids got in i dont know
since HE IS 6 ) and they took their own 6 yo as well. It started out as a nice trip downtown to watch an outdoor blues concert on friday nite with adult supervision and other older kids as well and ended up in a friggin bar & my son knockin on the door at midnite crying to come home. They live across the street. 
I have also had this family send thier kid over to my house and then they just leave and go out ! Well I put a stop to all that. 
Then the man across the street - he is always yelling at his wife to be - one time it was so bad i thought he was killing her banging stuff around in the house... .. she has no kids . a nice car and a good job, my ass would be outta there. My other naighbors have teenage kids that stay outside on the street til midnite or later and drive backwards up and down the street and yell and whatnot and leave fast food garbage in my yard. I live in a upperscale neighborhood so all I can think of is that the world is growing more ignorant everyday....

      I have figured out my problem and it seems to be OTHER PEOPLE. I would not say all ppl , just the majority of ppl. Im so sick of my neighbors telling me all about my yard because they have lived in this area longer than me & explaining how all the trees in my yard that are new trees are wild trees and how I should cut them down. I think the world needs more trees , I mean isnt thousands being cut down in our rain forests as I type ? I dont see the harm in a few trees being in my yard even if they are on the other side of her fence. I am told by my neighbors "my plants wont grow, they cant get sun !" you know cause of MY TREES. I dont think anyone in the world cares if her plants dont get sun and I do care If ya lean over the fence and cut my trees down. 
Look at the big picture here folks, GEESH. We need more trees!

      I have a friend , he asked me to not name him , he is 57 and has been a victim of identity theft thru his checking account. He understands the problems with identity theft and increasing technology and that losers exist that do this... what he cant come to terms with is Bank One telling him it could take 5 years to complete the investigation. He has had $2300.00 since February stolen from him and one amount in this amount was big enough that the bank notified the FBI. The biggest problem he is facing is that he has not received his money back from the bank. Bank One has no immediate intention of giving him his money back. He is retired. He once bounced his mortgage payment when the theft first occured. I just wanted all that bank with Bank One to know this. What if $2300.00 disappeared out of your checking account and you couldnt get it back.. what if all the money you had was in your account and then poof then next day its gone. What would you do ? The bank is going to do NOTHING and you my friend are SOL.
