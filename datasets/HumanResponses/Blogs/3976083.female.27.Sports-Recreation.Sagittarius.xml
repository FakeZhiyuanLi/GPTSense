						    Recently joined a "reunion group" on yahoo... sadly, it just reminds me of the minority I existed in for four years. So many stayed behind in Deer Park. I'm not sure if I should be glad that they know where they want to be or wonder if they've been permanently brainwashed as my husband so cleverly put, "Grampa worked in the mine, Daddy worked in the mine, and I'll work in the mine." Of course, the mine now being the chem plants out there. I guess without people like them... I wouldn't have branched out into the world away from WASP pseudo-microcosm known as Deer Park.   I wonder what each individual would have done if they would have had the chance to walk in my shoes. Probably gone on anti depressants and Xanax much sooner than I did!   Hah! Taking a break from the skating. Crappy weather which leads to crappy health which leads to day off from mold infested rink. Mold and all, I love my job. How many of the Deer Park people can honestly say that.

						   Summer's almost over, but I'm finally getting a short vacation of sorts from the rink. I actually get to have a "normal" schedule for the next few weeks until the next project comes up. As much as I enjoy the company of kids, M-F from 10-3 for 9 weeks straight was enough for me. Clearly, I'm not cut out to be classroom educator or child care. Despite the 140 so hours at U of H's school of psych, the analytical side of me just gets in the way too often, especially during the longest 9 weeks of my life known as Camp Blizzard. BTW, thank you Caitlin! Without you, I wouldn't have made it through the Camp. For those who don't know Caitlin... she kept me from losing my mind during the camp by stepping up and distracting the troublesome campers (not all were maddening) or choreographing when my imagination had been frozen by powers of Kidtatancula, the dreaded arch enemy of all coaches. Kidtatancula's powers of super tantrum throwing and group whining have been known to vanquish many coaches. Lucky for Caitlin and I, when we team up, we become Indestructinstructron. Our powers are ultra excitement and the antithesis with impasse attitude, You-must-be-too-tired-to-skate-let's-go-see-mom, and of course the biggest power of all... skate-or-get-off-the-ice. Not only can we use these powers separately, but when together... Kidtatancula slowly melts back into the individual skaters of the group. Trading cards available soon. Buy some and play with your friends.
