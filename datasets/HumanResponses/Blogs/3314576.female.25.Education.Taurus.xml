      ONE..........MORE...........DAY!  I can hardly believe it!  I went to workout tonight and-- pathetically (sp?)-- it hurts to sit here and type.  lol.  I guess that means it was a   good   workout.  Tonight it rained so much!  Or as Stephen says, "it was a gully washer."  hehehe.  What a fun day!  The kids even scrubbed their own desks!  Less scrubbing for me to do this summer :)  Gotta get to bed.  I have a feeling morning will come early tomorrow....

      I can hardly believe it!  Only 2 more days left of school!  With the kids, that is...  It feels kind of bitter sweet.  On one hand, I think I'm more ready for school to end than they are (if that's even possible).  On the other hand, there are some kids that I just want to fail so that I can have them again.  I think it will be the neatest feeling... years down the road... to see my 'kids' (of course, they are always 'my kids') when they are older and in high school or even after that.  I wonder what they will become?    I feel like these last few weeks have just been so crazy.  Every night- it seems- I crawl into bed exhausted.  I guess it's because the end of the year gets so crazy.  We had testing- that was crazy in itself and I won't get into it here because I could go on for days....  Last week, I had several really late school nights- sometimes not getting home until 8:30 or 9pm.  That's late when you go in at 7am!  To think- When I first started, I used to stay at school all the time!  If I left before 7pm it was a miracle.  In fact, if I left before 7pm, then I'd come back and stay until 9pm or 10pm.  I wish I could have felt more 'together' with the amount of time I put in.  I guess that's the only way to get better with teaching- put in the time ;-) lol......    This is such a great career- I mean- I think it's THE BEST career.  Every year I get to feel like such a kid with new supplies and a fresh start.  Every year you get to start over with a clean slate feeling better and a little more prepared than the year before.   Other stuff.... I feel like my mind is swimming, but I have to get to bed!- and I STILL have to do my report cards.  hmm...... maybe I'll do those during my special class tomorrow- but could I get them all done by then?  Tonight was busy- I was home for about an hour, then went to workout-- whoohooo!  I decided that if I workout for   more   than an hour, then I get 2 stickers on my calendar!  I didn't even get to really finish what I was supposed to do in 1 1/2 hrs!  And I was really 'hoofing' (lol... I don't know how in the world to spell what I'm trying to say) it!  I mean- I still did a good job with my exercises and cardio, but I didn't even finish the last sets for 2 groups of exercises!  I think I'm going to have to split them up when I go each time.  Then I went to bible study, which was fun.  I feel like church and exercising can be similar things.  Even though I hate to admit it- there are times when I really have a lot to do and I feel like I should be doing those things rather than go to church.  Just like I can look for an excuse to skip working out.  BUT-- there has NEVER been a time for either activity where I've gone and I've walked out thinking "hmm... Yeah- I should have done my errands or just slept in."  lol...   Well, so much for this being a short little post!  I guess- even though I don't post too terribly often, this has become quite the little outlet :)  gotta scoot.

      There's something about rain that feels so fresh.  I'm not a fan of lightening and I have just found out that neither is Lucy.  I do love thunder..... too bad I can't get one without the other.  Right now I'm sitting in my house ready to go to bed and there's a huge storm that is just brushing by Bowling Green.  It's close enough that there's constant thunder and lightening, but the rain just plops (literally plops) down randomly.  Ooh, it would be so nice to go to bed and have a heavy rain just beat down on my roof (my bedroom is great for rain-- those tall ceilings are the best!)  I have a feeling that's not going to happen.  Maybe because I just checked 2 (count 'em TWO) live doppler radars that don't show anything going right through Bowling Green.  hehehe.  Well, it's just as well because I need to find some great science activities to do for the rest of the year (all 7 days!  I can't believe it!)   Goodnight for now.....  2 posts in one day!  wow.  Lucy just licked my nose.  I guess that means that it's really time to go.

      I don't have much time today to write.... or think for that matter.  I just spent the entire day scoring our portfolios.  I'm pretty happy with how my scores turned out-- the ones that scored an apprentice were not a surprise, but most of mine scored a proficient.  In case you are reading this and are unfamiliar-- I could go on for years about our porfolios and testing, but basically--- My kids could have scored a novice (not good), apprentice, proficient, or distinguished.  Usually, we don't have many distinguished.  A distinguished writer is not the sort of writer you teach-- it's the portfolio that gives you goosebumps.  In fact, I hear that you can conference a kid right  out  of distunguished, but not  into .  I'm not going to be Lucy's favorite person tonight because I am home for an hour and then I'll leave for another 4hrs. to listen to interviews.  We have an opening at our school and there are 4 interviews tonight.  I'm so whooped!  It was a good day though. I can't believe that there are only 7 days left of school though!  That seems so crazy.    Other stuff- I can hardly wait for my mom to come and visit.  I harrassed her about visiting for months and now she is!  Do I feel guilty about this?  Naaaa....... I may have guilted her into it a little, but it's not like I was convincing her to want to come... I was just convincing her that she should come sooner than later.  7 months is a long time to be away from home!  For me at least ;-)  I think my longest time without going home or seeing my fam. is 9months.  Mass craziness!  Well, this is kind of a boring post, but oh well :)  Gotta run...........  Ooh, I need to remember to post about my adventures last Saturday.

      Yesterday....... or maybe it was the day before.... I went driving with one of my friends.  We were driving to just enjoy the night and the gorgeous weather-- we were also going to go see this lake that is about 20 minutes away.  The road was narrow and winding, the trees had so many different colors of green-- I think even more greens than in my crayon box.  Sometimes I wonder:  How can you experience such awesome things in nature and  not  believe in God?

      You know, I've seen people do this 'blog' thing before and it always intrigued (sp?) me.  I think journaling is so great, but is it really something you want everyone to be able to see?  I suppose.....naturally..... I'm not going to put anything on here if I mind someone reading.  Anyhow, this might be fun.  Besides- I don't journal half as much as I should.  This is convenient.  Plus--- I'm a much faster typer than I am a writer.   If you are reading these 'blogs' (that's such a strange name-- it reminds me of those scary puppets my brother used to have.... what were they called?  boglins?  boggles?)... Anyhow- if you are going to read these, I should warn you that they are going to be little snippits of my life and my thoughts.  Pretty much-- they are not going to be jammed full of excitement.  Well, you know- I shouldn't say it's not going to be exciting stuff....  Hmmm......... It's going to be real.  How about that?  Real funny.  Real boring.  Real feelings.  And  Really  full of grammatical errors ;-)  Alright..... enough for now.  I think I may email Gen to tell her I'm thinking of doing this and I've actually taken the first steps.  My first blog (*awwwwwww*).  Goodnight.  One more day of testing!  yey!!!!  (Lucy is asleep on my lap with her head over my arm while I'm trying to type.  What a cutie patootie.)

      I guess some days I'm a writer.  Today I want to be a writer, but as I sit in the computer lab thinking about something to write, the cursor on my 'blank new document' is blinking at me in harassment.    I love Wednesdays.  Today is Thursday, but that's okay- I love Wednesdays.  On the Wednesday night, I always feel like the weekend is almost here!  It's always so exciting when the weekend comes so I can do whatever I want! lol....  Granted, I do love moments and events of the week-- it's not a negative thought, I just love the weekends.  Went to see Stepford Wives yesterday with some fellow teachers- it was pretty funny.  Makes me curious about the first Stepford Wives.  It was so great to see Maura and Jo.  We spend everyday together during the school year and then when summer begins, it's such a foreign feeling to go a week and not talk with them or gab about the goings on in our lives.  I got my planbook for next year- I'm so excited.  Being a teacher is so great.  Every year you start fresh.  New supplies, new kids, new ideas..... a clean slate.  So exciting.  I feel like such a scatterbrain today...... need to stop procrastinating.  Time to challenge that annoying, blinking cursor to a dual. (sp?)  Not sure who will win.  good music today:  Jack Johnson?  I think?  Indigo Girls and Ryan Adams.  ta ta.

      When we first started the Writing Project, we were told that we were all writers.  We were writers even if   we   didn't think so.    yeah right.   I knew better.  I knew that my worst nightmare was to be placed somewhere where they would make me write.  Give me a prompt, be specific, and tell me what to write.  Don't tell me to be creative and just 'get your thoughts out there!'  gag.  I don't have time right now to finish because we are about to leave the lab, but I just want to let you know (all of you out there who read this.  count = 0 ...lol....) that I am now a writer.  The morning of the 5th day of Writing Project, as I contorted my face and put on my mascara.... I became a writer.

      Today we are in the computer lab and we are supposed to be doing anything we need to pertaining to writing.  I'm not yet comfortable enough to blog on the wp blog page, so I thought I'd start by blogging here.  (I can't believe blogging is a verb! lol)  Today has been a great day so far- even thought is started out with my stepping on one of Lucy's bones and having it go   into   the bottom of my foot.  It couldn't have been in the tougher heel part... noooo.... it went into the softer part between your toes and your heal.... the arch I think is what it's called.  This morning we worked in groups to think of symbolism of the writing process.  It was a hoot!  I just happened to have a bunch of pictures of Lucy and Sharon suggested we compare the writing process to grooming/washing a dog-- it was so much fun.  I am learning so much as I participate in this project.  I also think it's pretty cool that the writing project I'm participating in is part of the National Writing Project!  I just think that is so neat.  We have to submit two writing pieces to the e-anthology for the NWP.  I'm not too confident in my writing ability, so I think I'm going to do a poem.  That way I won't have to worry so much about grammatical errors and mechanics.  I can just put my ideas down.  I'd better get writing....

      Lucy is whining, so this won't be long...  I feel like such a dork!  I mean seriously-- who is trained here:  me or the dog?  lol....  School is out and my room is almost packed up.  Yesterday I was sitting on a friend's porch and it suddenly started to downpour.  It was so awesome!  I love walking in the rain when it is coming down like that.  Let me specify though-- it wasn't lightening or thundering.  Last night I went to work out.  I finally tried this machine I have been eyeing (sp?) since I started going to the gym.  It's one of those machines that you see some lady using and you want to ask her "Did you take a class to learn out to use this machine?  That looks impossible!"  I did it for 10 minutes-- WOOOOHOOOOOOOOOO!  I'm proud.  I did my normal machines and treadmill for much longer, but I'm most proud of the 10 minutes on this gadget of a machine.  I was a whiner while I was doing it and I did think I was going to die, but in the end-- it was worth it.    I can hardly wait for Kelly's graduation party!  I just want to give her the biggest hug that will smash her ribs!  Well..... maybe I don't   really   want to do damage, but let's just say that I can hardly wait to see her in person!  To just sit there SEE her when we talk about the ridiculous things we talk about.  Sisters are the best.

      I cannot believe school is starting.  Where did my summer go?  I swear... if I ever met someone who seriously--- SERIOUSLY mentioned the phrase "Must be nice to have your summers off" to me..... I think I would want to just kick them right on the hiney.  Sometimes I think it will be a relief when the kids actually get there because I will be able to teach.  Enough about school.  Naaaaaaaa..... nevermind... My brain is tired.  I think I'm going to go to the dollar movie theater.  No thinking involved :)

      I picked this new template..... now I'm not quite sure what I think of it.  Still kind of greeny and clean looking.  Not that I want some dirty lookin' page, just something a little more blah.  I thought the leaf-looking things were kind of neat though :)  I'm a science teacher, right?  G'night for sure this time.  Lucy is so spoiled... sleepin' on my lap while I type.  Who spoiled her?  How could I  not  when she's da cutest?  lol.... I'm so pathetic.

      I don't really have time to blog tonight.&nbsp; What am&nbsp;I talking about?&nbsp; Hmm... I  do  have time to blog tonight, but I don't really feel like it.&nbsp; There-- that's a little more accurate.&nbsp; I came to blog and the first thing that came to my head when I got to my page was "yikes!&nbsp; I have  got  to change my template.&nbsp; This bright, clean, simple, green stuff is just not going to work for me right now.&nbsp; I guess I'm just not in that kind of a mode.&nbsp; My mode is more like this:&nbsp; I can't believe school is starting so soon.&nbsp; Summer?&nbsp; What summer?&nbsp; Where did it go?&nbsp; I have science guides on my kitchen table covering my plan book, my curriculum map-- which I need to make work and use to work on our science lab schedule.... I also have several books I'd really like to/&nbsp;NEED to read before school starts and.......... where was I going with this?&nbsp; I just feel busy.&nbsp; I don't feel like blogging.&nbsp; My room at school feels like a tornado exploded through my files and I'm just.......ugh!&nbsp; Don't get me wrong-- great summer.... AWESOME summer of learning and I did see my family, but my brain just feels like one of those plants that has been watered and it's waiting for the water to seep through to the soil.&nbsp; Yep- I'm just waiting.&nbsp; But right now, there's just too much damn water sitting on the surface waiting to soak through.&nbsp; Off to find a new template.&nbsp; I guess you'll find out which one I picked if you're reading this.&nbsp; You?&nbsp; Who does read this?&nbsp; lol.... gonna scoot.
