       He posted a new picture today. In it he’s wearing his favorite (awful) yellow jacket, with his favorite (awful) somewhat matching tie, and his (only) nice pair of black pants. He looks like a pretentious (yes) hipster (not). In the other picture he’s standing next to his (former) motorcycle in his leather jacket (trying too hard to look alpha).   He loves word games. He thinks it’s clever to be able to decipher the mathematical equation or meaning behind a group of letters. To him it’s a mark of intelligence. He considers himself an intellectual (jackass). He is extremely articulate. He thinks his PhD entitles him to all of his (superficial) desires. He does not understand the value of hard work outside of academia. He has never seen outside of his (very small) box.  He has a deep voice and a dominant personality. He likes to be in control. He likes to be mysterious. He’s self-absorbed and self-indulgent. He rarely, if ever, thinks of other people. Unless (of course) he gains something from thinking of said other person. He is a monster in bed and a phenomenal kisser. He’s only kinda cute until you get him naked. Then he’s gorgeous.    He calls himself fearless and he probably believes it. He thinks emotions are a waste of time. He looks down on the act of feeling as weakness. He is (overly) rational and (always) logical. Everything has to fit into his plan.   (I didn’t.)

       Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone, Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone, Silence the pianos and with muffled drum Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.  Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead Scribbling on the sky the message He Is Dead, Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves, Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.  He was my North, my South, my East and West, My working week and my Sunday rest, My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song; I thought that love would last for ever: I was wrong.  The stars are not wanted now; put out every one: Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun; Pour away the ocean and sweep up the woods: For nothing now can ever come to any good.  W.H.Auden XX ~ The Collected Poetry of W. H. Auden 1945

       Noise. Loud music. Flashing images from the television. Pulsing floors resulting from the surround sound maxed out. I think best this way. If I turn it off the rest of me goes into full throttle, blocking out my inner voice. With the noise my voice comes out clearly, distinctly, separate from the rest of the chaos. With the noise I don’t have to create the chaos – it’s already there.  Five of us sit in a circle playing board games. It’s Tuesday – we do this every Tuesday. The game changes but the names stay the same. This week it’s Taboo, next week Pictionary. I like any of the games that are word games. I’m good at word games and letter manipulations. I’m not so good at pictures, visualizations or numerical representations.  I don’t like where this is going, it’s boring. Maybe I should turn off the noise. Maybe I should see if I can block out the rest of the chaos without adding more. Maybe, then, it wouldn’t be so boring. Maybe it’s not that boring and I’m just mental. Boring aside, maybe I’m just mental.  Sanity is lacking these days. A friend of mine told me was at loose ends and I wanted to tie them up for him. I wanted to fix it because I didn’t want him, of all people, to be at loose ends. To be confused, or unclear about his future. That’s my job,   I think.

The big one. He rocks.    Meeting Mike's incredibly cool roommates. It's funny, I'll likely never see or talk to them again, but they made such an impression it was worth mentioning.    Staying awake over 26 hours on my first day there because of the time change.    Going the wrong way on a streetcar but ending up in a really cool neighborhood because of it. Having a sense of direction is entirely overrated.    Discovering BART - mass transit, as a whole, fascinates me. I'm currently framing my BART map to hang next to my NY (a model for all to envy), Chicago (""L""), Boston (""T""), and London (Tube) maps that were acquired on previous trips. Admittedly, the Bart was the prettiest rapid transit route I've ever been on.    Shonen Knife and Deer Hoof show in SFO.    Walking up the hill that is Berkeley. I should have gone to college there.    Walking around a strange (to me) city but still being comfortable in my own skin.

       Last night the boy and I and had a fight. Again. See - I thought he was coming for dinner based on a conversation we had the night before. I made dinner. He didn't even call until 7ish and he lives an hour away. I, of course, flipped and thought he was standing me up. Left him a few messages - which infuriated him.  He was jonesin for a fight, really. You could tell. If it hadn't been the messages i left it would have been something else. He was still furious that he missed his train after we hit over an hour of traffic the day before. That, by the way, was my fault. I am the Traffic God. I control and can predict all upcoming traffic issues including parked motorcycles for Rolling Thunder taking up a lane on Constitution during rush hour.  I think I said "Fuck" a thousand times last night in frustration. Followed by throwing various hair product containers into the bathtub just to hear the noise.   Then I saw Jeff online and he surprised me by coming over on his motorcycle. Took me for an awesome ride - down 110, to Route 1 South. Back onto the beltway, then the GW Parkway, then back up 50 to home. At one point we hit 110 mph on 495. It was 11 at night when he got here so it was dark, and there was very little traffic. I was never worried. Even when we were in this lean going right - so close to the ground.  Jeff is fabulous.

       We ended up buying 3 DVDs for 25 dollars. In my neverending attempts to humor the current boy, one of them was a Vin Diesel flick.   A Man Apart   It wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. He'd seen it before. One of these days I'm dragging him to an artsy flick in Shirlington. I think I've earned it.

       I definitely feel like Plan B tonight.   Saturday night we had a surprise birthday/anniversary party for my mom. She turned 60 and it's been a year since she got her new liver. It was an amazing time - 30 people who love my mom there for her. Then there was brunch early this morning, followed by doggie shopping.  Mike is coming to visit next week! Yay.  What else? Lots on the mind. Thinking about fleeing to New York City for good. There's not so much here for me anymore and that reality is starting to wear me down.

       Got up bright and early and went with Higgins to the Western Maryland Bluesfest in Hagerstown, MD. Saw Jeff's band play - cool band. They did awesome though the Festicval sound guys were less than perfect. Jeff was none to pleased with the show, but we thought they were awesome. Higgins is great and it was a great day.  I was supposed to go to yet another show tonight at DC Nine, but my buddy changed the plans on me and decided to go the Herndon festival. I've spent enough of today in the cold rain. They'll call later to let me know if they're going elsewhere, indoors.  So, who knows about tonight. Tomorrow is brunch with Michael.

       Just got back from my writers group. Currently said group is comprised of myself and David. We start out talking about our lives which inevitably leads to us talking about our writing. Or, at this point, our lack thereof.   David is a true writer. You walk into his apartment to see walls covered with handwritten notes. His thoughts are always well articulated and full of wisdom gained from his 58 years or so. Every human being would benefit from this man's wisdom, and I get a few hours of it weekly over coffee at Bob and Edith's.

       Things I need to do before I go:   -Tell someone I dig him despite the inevitable rejection. It will make me stronger.   -Love someone - or admit to it.   -Open up to someone who doesn't deserve it. Just because.   -Find someone who will love CJ more than I do.   -Sleep.   -Did I mention sleep? It's 1:09a.m. We ate at Front Page and had a great time. I slipped and he caught me.   Okay - onto the blog part.   I've had 3 glasses of wine tonight. I'm quite the typist when I drink.&nbsp;I seem to hit all the right keys when I'm not thinking about it.   I've wasted a whole lot of time on people who just aren't worthy.   I was watching the city go by in a blur from the cab window. I love traveling over the bridges that connect VA to DC. Those views - the city from the outside - there's so much beauty in&nbsp;them.

             Fabulous People to Note    My bestest friend, Chris,&nbsp;(see earlier entry) came into town two weekends ago. I've known her forever. Is this instance forever means (27 - 8 = 19) 19 years. Forever.&nbsp;We had such a good time - it was like she never left.&nbsp;Actually, she never really did leave. She just moved away for a&nbsp;while. Best friends never leave.   &nbsp;&nbsp;   urlLink Mike Wong  was also in town a few weeks ago and I got to spend a whole entire day with him. We didn't even fight! It was amazing. He's special. He thinks I'm in love with him, when actually I just recognize he just adds goodness to my life. He lives in SF which means his goodness is hard to reach. That makes the couple times I get to see him even more memorable.    urlLink Colleen &nbsp;moved to New York and I am SO proud of her. She is brave and awesome and fabulous. So much braver than me.

       I had a few truly geek moments today.  &nbsp;  I spent the better part of the day on the phone with Microsoft trying to resolve the million message backlog my company mail server was experiencing since we did some work on it over the weekend.&nbsp; ( Some  work = 30 hours.) The techs were fabulous, canadian, and appreciated the fact that i laughed and exclaimed a lot. They said so. They then noticed my gmail account. &nbsp; Only true geeks would have the following conversation: &nbsp; "A gig? A WHOLE Gigabyte? How much? It can't be free. How'd you get an account?" &nbsp; So, I invited Paul Chan of Microsoft Toronto. He was so helpful today.

        urlLink CNN.com - Black holes: A way out? - Jul 15, 2004    After being involved with various scientists over the past few years, I always find myself taking extra interest in articles like the one above. That, and I always want to email the links to said scientists. It's almost a reflex. &nbsp; The problem is that when you're not on speaking terms with someone, sending them a link to an article they probably already read or even heard about in their little scientist circle, reeks of a transparent attempt to make contact. Based on the fact that I'm not trying to make contact, I'm just going to have to assume that there are certain reminders of him that will never go away. And he has no need to know that.  &nbsp; But I can still send the article to  urlLink Mike Wong . He's my favorite scientist to date.

       Crud. It has been the shortest but nuttiest few months I've had in a while.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Boys are dumb.  &nbsp; Need I say more? &nbsp;   The job is on the rocks.     &nbsp;  I'm now completely convinced that I'm not supposed to be here anymore. I have options.  &nbsp;  I bought a book called Organizing for Creative People. I thought about buying this book for my boss so he'd understand me better, and stop equating my lack of organization as laziness. I'm still thinking about this. My boss is sort of on my bad list because he called one of my coworkers to ask about my purported "nervous breakdown" on Monday. Nervous breakdown or not, this is totally inappropriate.  &nbsp;  On Monday I had scheduled the entire day to work on an in-house project that my boss had assigned to me in late May. Once the project plan was drafted we had a kick-off meeting and he chose to set a deadline date of the second week in August. He set this date fully aware that we were about to lose a staff member.&nbsp; We lost a staff member, and soon enough I was booked solid, with no time&nbsp;to do the in-house project. Wait. Except for the weekends. So, I have two actual days in the office in the next 4 months to&nbsp;use for the project. One of these days was Monday.  &nbsp;  I walk in the door after covering for a client early morning. A sexist client at that. I walk into disaster - no one had been taking or&nbsp;routing&nbsp;help desk calls, the new employee wasn't&nbsp;set up, and the office manager was off for half&nbsp;the day. There were&nbsp;6 calls waiting for me, and&nbsp;the phone wouldn't stop ringing.&nbsp;Except I was&nbsp;supposed to do the in-house project that day and there was no time. So I was frantic.&nbsp;I was not,&nbsp;however, having a nervous breakdown.  &nbsp;   The family is totally insane but hilarious.     A couple weeks ago my sister was in town. She and my mom spent a half hour on the phone trying to convince Comcast to put the Red Sox game on.   My parents adopted a second doggie - a rescue lab named Blue. Luckily, Maxie gets a friend. This is all good news.    I need to get out of this city   &nbsp;  It's a&nbsp;goal. &nbsp;

       I've worked for this client for three years. Some people just don't get it. This particular user sends panicky messages on a regular basis, usually copying her boss (who is my supervisor) and my boss. The server isn't down. The server is NEVER down. The server has never actually gone down at that client - in THREE YEARS. Yes. I'm THAT good.    Thanks to this email her boss/my supervisor will ask me WHY, possibly, this user thought the server was down. And I'll have to explain, again, that without a proper description of her problem, I can't even tell if there *was* a problem. Because, if she can access email to TELL ME that the server is down, the server isn't down.  I don't expect people to understand the basic concept of a network. That would be asking too much. I do expect people to give me a proper description of the problem they're encountering, if they expect me to fix it. Apparently, that is also asking too much.    From: *censored*  Sent: Monday, July 05, 2004 8:30 AM To: Molly;   Subject: The server is down!   I don’t know if this was planned or not, but the server is down today, July 5th.     Sincerely, *censored-association-person* Executive Director *censored* Foundation     From: Molly  Sent: Monday, July 05, 2004 1:10 PM To: *censored* Subject: RE: The server is down!   Dear *censored-association-person*:  I need more information. If the server was actually down, you wouldn't be able to access email, which you can. Can you not access files? Is it via the VPN? What exactly are you having problems accessing?  Thanks, Molly

       I feel invincible today. So invincible that I walked/ran 4 miles, and hefted a TV twice as wide as me upstairs without dropping it.  This weekend I was in NYC with my friend  urlLink Colleen  who, as i've mentioned before, is fabulous. She lives in a great neighborhood with a roommate and a crazy dogcat named Bill. The rest of my family was also in town, and my dad only made one inappropriate comment all night. It was a good night.
