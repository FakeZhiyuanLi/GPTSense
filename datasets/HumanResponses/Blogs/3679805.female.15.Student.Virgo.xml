      today was just another day of finals... but 2 more days till im outta this hell hole!   thank god!    today tho.. i realized something... i dont need a guy to make me happy... sure i say that now and tomorrow ill be wishing im with someone..  but i have my friends there by myside and as long as i have that im golden  i also realized never to let a guy control your life... dont let him tell you what to do.. when to do it or who to take walks with.. its not healthy especially when you change so much that even your best friends are concerned dont  ever  change or do things just to make a guy happy even if you think your in love.... and more importantly... always, always save time for your friends.. dont consume yourself with someone just b/c you think you love em its just not right...    worried bout yah... yah know who you are :-/   ~kc

      There's a boat, I could sail away There's the sky, I could catch a plane There's a train, there's the tracks I could leave and I could choose to not come back  How far do I have to go to make you understand I wanna make this work so much it hurts, but I just can't Keep on giving, go on living with the way things are So I'm gonna walk away And it's up to you to say how far  There's a chance I could change my mind But I won't, not till you decide What you want, what you need Do you even care if I stay or leave Oh, what's it gonna be Out of this chair, or just across the room Halfway down the block or halfway to the moon   ...its kinda like that :- just likin the right guy for me at the wrong time!

      I heard "Get Low" today adn all  i could think about was my field hockey ladies  I miss you girls so much I miss spending all of my time at the field with you all.  I miss the songs I miss the laughs. I miss the tears. I miss the fights. I miss the bonding. I miss the spice girls on the bus rides home. I miss how we comforted each other when we had a shitty came. I miss most of all is just being together, listening to angie tell us how she wants her    boobs to grow!    We dreaded....  the fact that kelly was leavin us  the fact that as soon as the season was over some of our bonds might break  jv season.. we all know we are in for an awakening   We loved...   the practices   the games   the parties   the bus rides   the inside jokes no one else got (ex. BLUE BALLS?!?, F.O.W?)   our coach!!   the spice girl songs angie use to sing on top of her lungs   the season   I miss you ladies already... we did such a great job going 8 straight games with  out loosing one! i love you ladies so much... i dont know what id ever do if i never met half of you!!! especially sully.. haha on fire are we? ;-) good times ladies good times!     ~kc

      sometimes you just gotta listen to your heart and not your head...  i apologize for not being the 'perfect' girlfriend but i cant do it all...  But Never say I love you if you dont truely mean it because you'll end up hurting someone in the end.  But why cant friendship be enough?? Why does it need to be something more??  I have asked my self...       why back to him?      why not the one i truely like?      why not find someone new?  And i always come back to the same answer    "b/c i thought i loved him and couldnt live with out him"    WELL LOOK AT ME NOW! im doing fine on my own!!      ~kc

      There's something about...  *butterflies before the game  *sweating out the stick check  *blocking the shot   *going on 1 on 1 with the enemy    *scoring the winning goal  *playing till you'd drop dead    ..there's something about   Field Hockey   only a player could understand...   _______________________________________________________   - Coming home dirty and sweaty...  Coming home bruised and battered...  - feelin so tired that you dont even want to do a damned thing...  not wanting to get up in the morning b/c your so tired from the day b4 and you know that its just gunna happen again...  - Getting those weird tan lines...  Being up at 7 two weeks before school started...  - The yearn to just do it...  Having all your differences disapear when you get on that field with my favorite 18 ladies...  - The smell....                       ....what we do for the sport we love...

To My Dear Friend,  A friend is someone who's  always there A friend is someone you know who cares They're someone who will share your dreams Someone who will hear your screams They're someone who will lend a hand Someone who will take your stand They're more than a laugh and  a wonderful time More than someone who will  loan you a dime They're someone who accepts the  good and the bad Someone who will cheer  up the sad They're people who can play around The people who won't let you down They're someone who will stay by your side Someone who you know won't lie They're someone who knows  who you are Someone to help you reach  for the stars They help you to over come your fears They're someone who will  wipe away your tears They're somone to teach you  the beauty in art Someone who always stays close to your heart They're someone to keep you on the right track Someone who won't just  turn their back They're someone to help you  keep your head clear Someone to help you drink  a beer They're someeone who is with  you throughout the day Someone who's trust just  doesn't fade away They're someone who will always be Able to accept me just for being me!  Thanks Friend!

      today was just another day of finals... but 2 more days till im outta this hell hole!  thank god!   today tho.. i realized something... i dont need a guy to make me happy... sure i say that now and tomorrow ill be wishing im with someone..  but i have my friends there by myside and as long as i have that im golden  i also realized never to let a guy control your life... dont let him tell you what to do.. when to do it or who to take walks with.. its not healthy especially when you change so much that even your best friends are concerned dont ever change or do things just to make a guy happy even if you think your in love.... and more importantly... always, always save time for your friends.. dont consume yourself with someone just b/c you think you love em its just not right...    worried bout yah... yah know who you are :-/   ~kc

      There's a boat, I could sail away There's the sky, I could catch a plane There's a train, there's the tracks I could leave and I could choose to not come back  How far do I have to go to make you understand I wanna make this work so much it hurts, but I just can't Keep on giving, go on living with the way things are So I'm gonna walk away And it's up to you to say how far  There's a chance I could change my mind But I won't, not till you decide What you want, what you need Do you even care if I stay or leave Oh, what's it gonna be Out of this chair, or just across the room Halfway down the block or halfway to the moon   ...its kinda like that :- just likin the right guy for me at the wrong time!

       so i was sittin outside on my back porch with reily just thinkin... and you know sometimes when you just sit on your porch or like just outside, you can just feel like nothing else matters. All that matters is that one little moment in time when you are enjoying yourself. No one can bother you...... then reality hits you like a slap in the face.. yah well i hate that.. i was just begining to think about why im still likin erik and then all of a sudden 'kate, dinner'... im like damn it i lost my train of thought... o well.. just thought id share....     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   ~kc

       I'd sure hate to break down here.   Nothin' up ahead or in the rear view mirror.   Out in the middle of nowhere knowin'   I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'.   So God help me keep me movin' somehow.   Don't let me start wishin' I was with him now.   I've made it this far without cryin' a single tear   And I'd sure hate to break down here.   - Julie Roberts    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  i love that song...it makes me jsut wanna sit down and think about all the shit thats going on in my life and makes me wonder, why am i still trying to be with you...why do i even care ne more? am i this pathetic to want something this much?.. i mean honestly i can live without you as well.. but id really like to live with you... whatever    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  lunch time.. ill write back later
