         Well, It's now Sat. the 21st of August, and I still am unemployed. Right now, I keep hearing from numerous sources that even if I don't get hired before schools start, then I could get hired still later. Also, I was told that many new teachers (not just first years) in KCMO don't last 'til Christmas. That would help me to get a job you would think!!

        Hello. Well, today's interview went well. She said she should hopefully know something by today's end, but who knows when and if I'll hear from her. I'll keep you posted of course!

        Hello again!     Well, my interview at Richardson Elem. went okay. However, I won't know anything 'til Friday, as they have interviews as late as Thursday. So, now I'm sitting and waiting even longer! (Yes, I'm not only getting impatient, but frustrated as well!)          However, my luck turned around again this evening. I got a call from Phillips Elem. Their enrollment was high, and they now have to hire new teachers for both 1st and 2nd grade. I have that interview tomorrow morning at 10 am. It would be funny if I worked there being as Phillips is Jesse's last name! ;-)          Anyway, apparently my friend Valerie has been on the same KCMO interviewing rollercoaster as me. In fact, she was supposed to interview for the same position today that I did, but when she got there she didn't like the looks of things, so she went home. I thought it was an okay neighborhood and that I've seen worse. However, wish us both luck!! It's crunch time this week!!      I really don't want to have to resort to substituting everywhere, but I will if I have to! Take care everyone, and keep checking back here for more updates!           Love, Jenifer

        Hello. My interview with Richardson Elem. is tomorrow at 12:30. I'll keep you posted. Scarritt called me back today to say they went with another candidate. At least they had the decency to call me!! I can't say the same for Troost, Sanford B. Ladd, or Knotts. I haven't heard from any of them and they haven't returned my calls. I find that quite rude.           Anyway, Keep checking this site for more info on me! Take care!           -Jenifer     P.S. I found out at Colorguard practice tonight, that one of my colorguard girls, Miranda, needs some prayers. Her oldest brother is serving in Iraq right now (I'm unsure which branch), and her parents told her they received bad news regarding him. They won't tell her or her other brother the exact nature of the news either. So, she was really upset tonight. Just keep her and her family in your prayers, as I cannot imagine what they are going through right now. Thanks!

        Hello! Well, Richardson Elementary  (KCMO) called me tonight. They have a 3rd grade position open. The position is open because it is the exact position that my friend Kristen got offered and turned down. So, Kristen told me what questions they'll ask, and how NOT to answer them!! What a good friend! I have the interview on Tuesday at 12:30. I really hope this is it! :-)          Anyway, have a lot to do tonight and tomorrow! Have a good Monday everyone!           Love, Jenifer

       Hey all! Well, Friday's interview went really well! The school was really nice, as well as the prinicpal and vice principal. They have both a 3rd and a 5th grade position available. The vice principal was actually the same vice prinicipal from Monday's interview. She does part time at each school. She's really nice and even gave me a tour of Knotts after the interview Friday. The principal said he was supposed to call this weekend either way and let me know, but if I don't hear something today, I'm going to call him tomorrow. I'm sooooo tired of waiting, and am starting to get really discouraged, even though I need to keep the faith!  This job search is very slow! I don't understand why I don't have a job yet, with all the countless interviews I've been on this summer! It's not a very fun situation to be in this late in August! Jesse has been wonderful at supporting me through this time, as well as all the family &amp; friends who continually offer me notes and words of good cheer and encouragement! Thanks. They do make me feel better, but even though everyone says I'll get a job, it's hard for me to believe that at times right now.  Anyway, keep checking back for updates!! Believe me, when I do get a job, you'll all know! Take care and have a good week!    Go   TEAM   USA!!    -Jenifer

        Hi. Well, the principals all have meetings today, so it may be a slow or unproductive day as far as me hearing anything.           I will let everyone know when I do!          Ben called me today!! That was a nice wake up call!          Well, have a lunch date with my friend, Jenny!           Talk at everyone later!          -Jenifer

        Hello. Well both interviews are done for the day!       Scarritt actually wants me for ESL in 2nd grade, which means I'd be using my bilingual skills to teach English to non-native speakers. I'm not sure when I'll find out about that position.  Bryant Elementary called. She said she went with another candidate for the position, however, she said I was next in line. The only reason the other person got it is because they already have some teaching experience. The other first grade teacher that was already employed (not the new hire) is near retirement age, and she thinks that because the other teacher left this one may, too. So, if that happens, it sounds as if I have a job! Tomorrow there are district wide meetings with all the principals and she said she's going to pass my name onto all the other Elem. Principals because she was impressed with me. I really liked that school and the area (On the plaza off of Wornall). I hope something works out for me there!  However, there are still 4 interviews I haven't heard back from yet! I still think I'll get something from these interviews, but it's a matter of when and where! I am trying to keep faith!  Anyway, check back soon for more updates! Take care everyone! -Jenifer

        Hello! My Bryant Elem. interview went well. She was really nice, and the school was good, too! She has about 5 or 6 candidates for one 1st grade position.  She said she'll know something by late afternoon or early evening today!! Wish me luck!      Also, Sanford B. Ladd was supposed to know something today, too. So, this could be a big day for me!      I still have my 1:30 interview today at Scarritt Elem. for a 2nd grade position. So, I'll let you know how that goes!      Wish me luck and hopefully something this week will bring me a job!! My friend Kristen got a job offer, and is supposed to decide for sure today! Yay!           Take care everyone!      -Jenifer
