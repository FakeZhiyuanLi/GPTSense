      Let's try this again:)  Life is so wonderful, today I talked to my good friend Becky and she's here for a visit from Florida.  Lucky me!  We're going to get together on Monday night for a visit, and probably again Tuesday.  We've always had such a strong relationship, it doesn't matter how long between our visits they're always fun and she's so easy to be with.  She's a great MOM, and it's all she ever wanted was a family of her own.  Tonight another buddy is on his way to our home for a weekend visit, and tonight we're going out with friends.  Just trying to pack it all in before Mike and Courtney leave for AZ.  Every weekend is going to be full....full with family and friend time.  The biggest surprise is that today the weather actually cooperated, not gorgeous out but nicer than we had had lately.

      I'm finally catching up with the computer generation, and have created a blog site--Wow!.  As far as I'm concern this is what I've been waiting for --a place to be "Me" and tell how the Cute Uke continues to survive.   Let's get going... Today was another cold day in North Dakota.  You'd think in June, late June that you'd be able to wear some fun summer clothing....but no it's 64 degrees, let me repeat 64 degrees, doesn't God know it's SUMMER in ND.  The state that never has consistent weather, so we wait for summer and drool over every warm day as if it's our last, and even more of a score is the day that the wind doesn't blow, thus today I got the double wammy no warmth and gee we'll throw the wind in just for fun.  It's really wearing on people's patience.  But enough wining from me.  I'm so glad Courtney turned me onto this, Lindsay has done it for ages but I hadn't seen her site; but tonight she's going to show me her's as well.  Okay here's the deal I'll do my best to blog on a regular basis, but I'm not going to force it.  When it's right it'll happen. Bye and Thanks for being here for me....you'll help I just know.
