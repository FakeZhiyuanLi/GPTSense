      I'm sure the burning question on your mind right now is why name my site Wally The Tuna. Well let me tell you why, because you won't forget it. I mean honestly, who's going to forget a name like wallythetuna. Now the next question is where wallythetuna came from. Well grab a hot cup of whatever you like (preferably whatever is in the cup is hot and not the cup itself) and let me tell you a dull story about me... You see I was a loser, well heck I'm probably still a loser but that's beside the point. Way, way, way back when, like 7 years ago, I couldn't get a date to save my life (I probably could have had more luck had I actually asked a girl out on a date). And since I really didn't want to be single forever, I tried what all good geeks of my time did, Internet dating. Well actually Internet personals. So I perused the personals looking for someone who might like to talk to me. I posted a couple of things here and there and eventually found out that not only did girls not want to talk to me in person, they didn't even want to do it over the internet. I assumed at the time that it was because of my dull, uneventful, uncreative, awkwardly depressing life. So I did what any red blooded American male who can't get a girl to talk to him does... I made stuff up. In fact I'd spend hours specially crafting emails that were not only funny, but made me appear witty. Give anyone 20 or so hours and eventually they can come up with a paragraph of witty material. So after a week of working on it, I finally got my intro email done, and then I sent the same email to like 20 girls. Yes, we have confirmed by this point that I was (if not still am) pathetic. Surprisingly, the email worked and I started getting responses.  Well needless to say I continued writing these emails and sending them out and while nothing ever panned out from any of them, one thing did emerge and stay with me to this day and that is wallythetuna.   Now I'm sure you're sitting there thinking "that didn't tell me anything about the origins of wallythetuna" and I respond to that as, you're right it doesn't.  Cause honestly, I can't remember how I came up with the name.  I just remember that I came up with it back then and that's about the extent of my memory of that.  Well now that I've sufficiently wasted your time, please feel free to continue to peruse the site.

      I thought I'd throw down a picture of the boy since I haven't done it yet. This one is from the 4th of July collection and probably my favorite from the whole bunch.   urlLink

      I thought I'd post some photo's of Sydney aka "Baby Doll".  Why Baby Doll?  Well she's a baby, and she's no more bigger than a doll so Baby Doll it is.  She's a month and a half old now and finally home this last week.  These pictures are from when she was in the hospital.  I'll post some more recent ones in the days to come.

       urlLink    A week after she was born she was upgraded to the Isolette to help her maintain her body temperature, and give her a little more peace and quiet as the Newborn intensive Care Unit was quite noisy.

       urlLink    Here she is 4 days old and finally off all the breathing machines.  To ensure she was still getting enough oxygen, they had her on under a hood for a couple more days.

      As if there aren't enough of these already, I have to get in on the action.&nbsp; But just like Bill Gates I wait until it's already mainstream and probably soon passe before actually doing something about it.&nbsp;
