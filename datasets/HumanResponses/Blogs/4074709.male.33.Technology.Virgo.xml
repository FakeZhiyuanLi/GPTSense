      Well it's kind of funny.&nbsp; I was on blogger yesterday and set up this blog.&nbsp; I was just a little bit curious as to how the software and web sites interact.&nbsp; Then on the way home Diane ( oh, that's my wonderful G/F) was asking me about ways to set up a website for her employees to share information.&nbsp; So I think that I will start to utilize this blog, and see if anybody has anything to say about what is going on in my life.

      7/29 was her Bday.  She doesn't want a big production, so I did not do anything at work for her.  But I did go ahead and buy her some presents.  Nothing really big, but a bunch of little stuff that she said she wanted.  She said that it was the best Bday ever, so I guess that I did good.  On Saturday we went out to Clearwater Beach and road on the  urlLink Sea Screamer .  It was supposed to be the world's largest speed boat.  I wasn't impressed with how fast it went, but when the dolphins came out to play, it was fun.  They were riding the wake of the boat, and jumping.  It was totally cool.  Then we went to Post Corner Pizza.  The absolute best pizza in the Tampa Bay area.

      Well, I've been pulling out my hair lately.  Not that I had any to begin with.  I had an email server runnin W2k3 and Exchange 2003.  I did not close my relay agent on the server, so I became a spam relay machine.  Being new to exchange, I was seeing some performance issues with my server, and some errors in my application event log.  I finally determined that I was relaying spam.  I was turning off, and turning on all kinds of parameters in my software.  Not tracking any of my steps.  Very bad to do.  But then all of a sudden I was unable to send or receive any email at all.  I received an email from my ISP stating basicaily that I was a relay agent, and that I needed to fix my server.  Well, now it's the weekend.  I decided to just scrap my server and start from scratach.  I have now totally rebuilt my server from scratch.  But I can't test it because my ISP has blocked port 25 on my IP address.  I called the help desk, but of course, it's the weekend and they really can't help me.  I will have to call the VP of internet security on Monday and see if they can open up the port.  Then maybe I can get my email back up.  Oh, I have also created forms on my website (bbengs.com) that rely on me sending out email.   So now that doesn't work also.
