      Hey everybody!! I saw spiderman 2 at 2 this morning. Good movie by the way. You all should see it. Got 7 free games on Initial D for no reason, so that was cool. There's this one part where... Shoot, I'm not gonna tell you. Haha. Love you all.  -----Johnny

      My weekend consisted of nonstop yardwork. Ooh fun. Anyways, I missed all of you and am just happy to be back. I can't figure out what car to use for the Initial D team. Oh well, I'll find an answer someday.   -----Johnny

      Just this morning I received a copy of Initial D: Mountain Vengeance. I had noticed that not only were there very limited cars, but no good techno! It was mostly rock. I will not stand for the fact that Initial D is an American mainstream icon. It should stop before it starts. No more bad versions of Initial D, that's not cool. Also, if you're gonna make an Initial D game, make sure that it is as accurate as possible. Anyway, that's my 2 cents in this situation. Until next time, don't buy butchered Initial D.  -----Johnny

      I forgot to tell everyone that 2 of my hamsters died. Hamtaro and Angelina are dead. Beary still lives on. I loved them like they were my own hamsters. To me they were people on a really really small scale. Their memories are still with me and they are still alive in my heart. If you think of it, tell one of your pets how much you love them.  -----Johnny

      Hey everybody, I just got back from the Del Mar Fair with Dalton Steele. We were there the whole day and spent alot of money on food. I bought a Carbon Fiber cell phone cover. It looks really tight. Anyway, miss you all and we need to hook up sometime this summer (you know who you all are). Yes, I broke up with Stephanie last night for personal reasons. Let's see, oh, I know something I can share with you all. Dalton and I were running down a hill from Hollywood Video and I fell down it. Now I have a skinned knee and a hole in my hand. I got salt in it today at the fair and was just a teensy bit pissed.   -----Johnny  P.S. It's good to be back!!

      I just realized that Chad from N.E.R.D. looks damn near identical to my friend Michael. The resemblance is crazy. Anyways, I'm just doing nothing. 'Knowing is half the battle!'  -----Johnny  P.S. Heres the link    She Wants To Move

      I just started listening to N.E.R.D. (No One Ever Really Dies). They are tight! All of their songs you can listen to over and over again without getting sick of them. My favorite songs are She Wants To Move, Rockstar, Baby Doll, and pretty much everything else on their new cd 'Fly or Die'. I also bought the new Beastie Boys cd. 'To the 5 boroughs'. I've listened to that cd many times and it's still cool. Ch-Check It is probably one of the best songs I've heard in a while. Other than that... Oh, I'm going to save up for a APC Carbon Fiber Hood, Mirrors, and Seats. Everyone's got to make a living so the prices are high. Very high if you've seen my budget. (Which is donations by the way.) I'm very excited to be finally working on my truck. My Neon Accent Lights are being used as dash trim. It's pretty pimp seeing that these big, *looking at hands* clumsy hands are actually doing something worthwhile. Well, nothing is new under the sun, and with that said See Ya'll Next Update!!  -----Johnny

      Grrr... This morning Brian Humble woke me up with a phone call. We talked about how messed up are cars are. Well, I have a truck, but anyway we compared chipped paint to scratches, engine sizes, wheels, interiors, and so on. Oh, that reminds me, I still have a crapload of stuff to do to it. Life is going alright at the moment. My friends are all jealous because I have a S10 and they ain't got nothin'. I guess I'm gonna keep working on detailing it since the neons are gonna take forever. See you next update!              ------Johnny

      Hey everybody, it's Johnny. Finally I have created my blog on a service I like. Blurty was kinda iffy and Xanga was too expensive for my "only spend money on my truck" budget. Anyways, my truck is really gonna make me poor over the next few years. Not only does it have a four cylander motor (which, by the way, has no power) and second of all, it's hella scratched. Everywhere. So I'm trying to save up for a bedliner and a new paint job. It really sucks being poor and having high goals for my truck. I don't even have a CD player. It's a tape player with the cassette/cd conversion. It's alreight since I play songs that I wan't off of my mp3 player. Now that's ghetto. Ok, but anyway, I really can't wait till I can drive some of my friends around. But of course, there's no such thing as a free ride. I'll think about prices. JK! Peace out everybody, and speed safely.             -----Johnny

      Okay, that's it, I am totally fed up with this shit. I can't take it anymore. First, before I rant on about my meaningless feelings, a quick thanks. Thank you to all you girls who turned me down, as you can tell I really f*cking appreciate it all.&nbsp; See what you've turned me into? Someone who you can just not take seriously or be brutally honest with. It always comes sugar coated and with an extra side of 'I&nbsp;pretend to care about you'.&nbsp; Thanks to all you who just turned me into a complete tool, but guess what. I don't degrade people for attempting to ask someone out they like you fuckers! That's right, I didn't asterisk it out. Fuck you. Fuck everything you told me. It doesn't mean shit to me.&nbsp;Look, you happy with the results of what you do&nbsp;to me?&nbsp;What? You haven't seen me get pissed at you before?&nbsp;You also haven't noticed that I CAN SEE THROUGH ALL OF IT?! DAMMIT YOU ALL! I'M FED&nbsp;UP WITH ALL OF IT! IS BEING SHALLOW AND FAKE TO SOMEONE WHAT LIFE IS REALLY ABOUT?!&nbsp;WELL APPARANTLY TO YOU IT IS,&nbsp;BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TORTURING ME WITH FOR THE LAST FOUR MONTHS! GOD, YOU SEE WHY I'M SNAPPY AT PEOPLE?&nbsp;IT'S&nbsp;CUZ YOU ALL PISS ME OFF BY BEING SOMETHING THAT&nbsp;YOU'RE NOT! BTW, everyone who dumps me gets a prize... A middle finger and a fat box of nothing, for you very well&nbsp;deserve it! Now, back to my feelings. Each day as&nbsp;I see the superficiality&nbsp;I start to lose more and more interest in caring.&nbsp;My thoughts are, "Why care? Nobody else does anyway!"&nbsp;Fuck,&nbsp; I so am not gonna stand for this shit anymore. Time for the killer in me to be let free, while the caring me takes a vacation to hell for the rest of the year.  -----Johnny

      "...A golden bird that flies away/a candles fickle flame/to think I held you yesterday/your  love was just a game ..." Think about what the band Cake is saying. For those of you who are wondering why I use song lyrics in my blog, well it's because they really apply to me right now. Here's what really kills me on the inside: I ask a girl out, they decline my request, and then think that I was just joking about it and not taking me seriously. I usually want to say, "Shit, it's not like I ask you for nothing. I ask you because I love you and I want to spend part of my life with you." Still, I fear that if I tell that to some girl I'll just get slapped down (like ususal) so I just keep it all to myself. Bottled up inside of me is love that I've never been able to use towards someone. Love that only very few who take me seriously will discover. Also, next to that bottle, is fear. Fear of rejection, being made fun of, and someone exploiting my emotions. I can't stand it anymore! I'm tired of people who are shallow! Why can't girls just want to be with someone who actually cares! Shit! I feel that if I had a gun... The rest is up to you, but for me, being turned down is not...  -----Johnny

      "...we'll cruicify the insincere tonight..." Yes, we will. The Smashing Pumpkins are good to listen to if you're depressed. *cough*Me just a little*cough*. It's sad because summer flings just come and go with the years. Deep down inside we all know that they mean nothing. Nothing other than bragging rights for some. "Oh I went out with..." Then they can feel proud about a meaningless relationship. I don't know, it just strikes me funny that people find me nice and a high count of exactly 0% of them would actually want to go out with me. I'm the one who is knocking on peoples doors, asking them for more then just a friendship relationship. Yet, I am also the one whos face gets slammed in the door due to lack of avaiability so they say. Here's a bit of advice to all of you: if you really don't like someone and they ask you out, tell them the real reason why you won't go out with them. Usually when I get turned down (all the time) I'm always told the same thing, "Johnny, I love you but in not that way." Or the classic, "You're a great guy and all but, no." That is what gives me the self anger. It's like, "Wow, okay so I'm apparantly a great guy, but no one wants to go out with me. Damn, I either got lied to or im just not good enough for anybody." So now you know, and I have nothing left to say. Just remember, be honest in how you feel.  -----Johnny

      Back from Pismo Beach this morning at 3. 5 Hours in a crowded truck -_-. Anyways, the beach was totally fun. Rented Honda EX 400's (Quad) and went riding out deep in the dunes. Did some good bowls, jumped, donuts, I did it all. There were an average of 2 people getting stuck with their trucks in the sand. Since&nbsp;my stepdad's&nbsp;'97 GMC 3500 Extended Cab &nbsp;Longbed has a 454 motor in it, we were obligated to pull people out. I'll post pictures when I get them developed. The people who camped in front of us were total dickholes. I wanted to get my shovel and just beat the hell out of them all. Oh, I also made a big sandcastle too. Anyways, glad to be back, missed you all.  -----Johnny

      Great, as usual, I'm single. The thing is, I like this girl, but I'm not sure if she likes me. It's kinda depressing without a girlfriend who you can just hang out with and talk to forever. I seriously think that Cupid is taking a piss on everything I try to do relationshipwise. All I can really say is, "Go to hell Cupid!" and then flip him off and keep on going my way. Like Lenny Kravitz, "...so much pain inside/so many tears I've cried/but baby it ain't over till it's over..." I just can't really figure out why it's such a struggle to go out with a girl that I like, and one that likes me. Like Bruce Hornsby, "...that's just the way it is/some things will never change..." *Sigh*   Until next time,   -----Johnny   If only you knew... AM

      I sit here and wonder, "What's the meaning of life?" According to some it's to be successful, others say a fast car. Most people say to have a wife and kids. Then I realized, "Wow, it could be a combination of either one of those..." To me, the meaning of life is to live it to the fullest. If you're successful, good. If you're unsuccessful, then I gues that's just the way it goes. So today, I found the meaning of life while pulling weeds in my backyard. Maybe I truly am intellegent but just don't know it yet. Maybe I should change some things in my life to use it better. Maybe I should relax more. I don't know. But one thing I do know, it's to make the right choices...  -----Johnny

      I was listening to the song Ghetto Musick by Outkast. It was more like low-fi bass instead of ghetto in my opinion. Oh well. Nothing is too new with me, so I guess I'll talk to you all later.  -----Johnny

      Don't you hate it when stupid people try to piss you off for no reason? The sad thing is, whenever people actually  try  to piss me off most of them don't succeed. On the other hand, there's people who just annoy the hell out of you regardless of what they do. They seem to always succeed with flying colors. So, in honor of all you stupid fucks who think it's funny to try and piss me off, well here's my gift to all of you stupid whores! A gallon of Depo-Provera so you'll stop overpopulating America. Also, for free, you can have a kick in the face! Wait, there's more! If you call within the next 20 minutes, you can get a dump truck to run you over! Doesn't that sound like fun? So in essence, if you piss me off time and time again, you will recieve the prizes above and get the satisfaction of pissing me off, you moron.  -----Johnny
