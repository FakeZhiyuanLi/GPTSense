      This is such a great word.  I heard it today in my ACLS class and decided that I would use it.  It means, "to talk in a dogmatic and pompous manner".    I went to my college roommate Charisse's wedding last weekend in NoDak.  She was, by far, the most beautiful bride I have ever seen.  I think she should be in the Bride Magazines.  It was just a perfect wedding.  And I didn't even get depressed.

      School, school, school.  That's all I do.  In fact, I am sitting here procrastinating, doing this, while I should be studying.  I want to write something deep and profound, but all I have to say is that this is absolutely the last thing I should be doing.  "I wish I was a dolphin", I said to my friend Julie today.  Really, when you think about it, that would be the coolest animal to be (unless of course you got caught in a tuna net...).  You could swim and jump and bob in the water to sleep, send out sonar waves and make clicking noises.  Everyone loves dolphins, too.  I wish I was one.

      Yep.  I do.  This whole Minnesotan accent just isn't cutting it for me.  I spent Independence Day weekend in Boston and Cape Cod, and I heard the best accents (Second, of course, to Scottish ones).  I want one.  For instance,   1. We were in Provincetown and this guy came up to me and asked, "Do they sell be-eah he-eah?"   2. Sitting in front of the Esplanade on the harbor, they broadcast this kid wearing a Yankees jersey (the crowd booed him), and this guy in front of me proclaimed "That kid's gonna be scahhed fa life!"   3. This drunk idiot on the T yelled, "I can predict the futah- the sawks are gonna win the warld series- they're gonna trade Nomah fa Randy Johnson"  I want to sound uneducated in a fun way.  Why not.  So I'm gonna say, as Lars says, "Go up frickin' 495, past the pahkin lawt and take a left at the retahded kid"...

      Why do people buy SUV's if they have absolutely no idea how to drive them?  I swear I almost get killed about four times a day driving in Philadelphia, mostly by SUV's.  I am not the best driver but at least I drive a vehicle I can handle.  I saw Samuel Dalembert(Sixers player, I see him at our gym all the time) the other day on the side of the road and I contemplated stopping to help him with whatever was going on with his tire.  But then I thought, "What can I do to help this guy?  Give him my tire gauge?  Change his tire?  First of all, this guy is like 7 foot 2, so I'm thinkin' his torque could be a little better than mine (even though I'm built like a Norweigan washwoman) and furthermore, he's loaded.  So he could hire somebody to fix his car.  Um, his SUV.  Which I think he can drive.
