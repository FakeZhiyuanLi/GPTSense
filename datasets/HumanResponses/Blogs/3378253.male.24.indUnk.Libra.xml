       "I will always see you marching in the Ghost Parade" - - Remember the Ocean - _tomorrow after dark_  It's apt, really, Kristin. I don't know if it's at all what you meant, but I can feel the trailing fingertips of all the people walking by so long after I said goodbye. Not ghosts, per se. Although the dead share this path too, and mix between the long-lost without regard or distinction; makes me fear, somehow, for loved ones who've not yet left the land, only my life.  Behind closed eyes they creep, slow paced and steady with the inexhaustible strength of my regret. In the quiet moments when I'm trying not to be blinded by the sun, they pass before me with reproach in their eyes. They stand apart from each other, most of them, to leave room for me, right there beside. Every one of them reminds me, silently and angrily, that I left them there. Nights hold no rest.

      I was confused this morning. No messages from you. Not one. Couldn't figure out what I'd done, why you suddenly were ignoring me. Took me a moment 'til I realized that it was only in my dreams that we'd been talking again, like before.        [No poetry. No hyperbole. No art. Just truth.]

      I want you to know a few things, chief among which is that you are, I believe, wrong. I haven't listened to your voicemail yet, because honestly, I don't want to know for sure what you think. I have my assumption, which may well be wrong, but I am working from it because I want to tell you something that is, in fact, kind of rare in my life. So often I hide one thing or more, only show one side of my life, all that sort of thing. I want to tell you the whole truth.   But, first and foremost - my friend's visit is entirely unrelated to what happened between you and I. I know you don't believe that, and I know that's my fault. But it's true.   Anyway.     		_the truth_   	M______, who came to visit this weekend, is a friend of mine, and a sometime "friend with benefits."  	[No; never, ever, ever while I was with you. And never would have been. Never.] 	She and I had "hooked up" once before you and I were together; neither of us wanted any sort of serious relationship in our lives, so it was just that. Day-to-day, we are just friends. We email most days, talk probably once a week. Nothing sexual at all, because we really are ~friends~. There was, though, always the understanding that when we saw each other again, if neither of us was in any kind of relationship, we'd like to hook back up as well as just hang out. The one topic of conversation we never got on was relationships - I never asked her if she was dating anybody, and she never asked me. You assume the other person is, and behave accordingly, but it's not anything you talk about. So no, I'd never told her about you. I'd been trying to get up the nerve to tell her before her visit when things between you and I came to a head.  	I believe, right now, that you think I broke up with you so I could be with her. I want to be hurt by that, and I am, but I'm fully aware it's my own fault for lying to you about this weekend. 	The fact of the matter is that, had things between you and I not gone the way they did, I'd've told her I was seeing someone, and she and I were going to be ~only~ friends this weekend. She would still have come to visit, and that'd be that. We'd've hung out. Again, truth here: I would not have told you that she and I had been together before. The past being the past, and immaterial, I'd feel, to what you and I were. Also, I have assumed that the whole "friends with benefits" thing would not be well-receieved here, so I've hid that, too. I thought it was something you (and everyone here in this small town) would dislike me for. I am ... horribly sorry for lying to you. I've been more wholly truthful with you than I have with almost anyone else in my life, but some things I came in to our relationship already having decided weren't something to share in this town. By the time you and I were more serious and I was more comfortable, some things had already been established, either already said or just an idea and stance I'd put solidly into place in my mind, and I didn't know how to bring them back about. 	Anyway - like I said. My sexual relationship with M______ was before my time with you. My friendship with her was current. The possibility of sex was there for some futures. It was never, ever a part of my day to day relationship with her.  	I broke up with you for all the reasons I said, and nothing more. I know that the timing and the fact that I lied about her visit makes it look like something other than that, but it's entirely coincidental - I broke up with you because of the conversation we had the day before, not because of plans for the weekend. 	 	As I'm writing this, I know that you will not believe it. I'm angry at myself, for treating you so badly that you do not believe I loved you. I'm nauseous at the thought.  	I'm not dating anyone else. So, presumeably, the only reason to break up with you for someone else would be sex. Do you remember our time together? Do you remember how I treated you in bed? Honestly, do you think I am motivated by wanting sex? 	I don't know. Obviously you do. Obviously, like I said, my fault. 	Yeah, I enjoy the hell out of sex - who doesn't? But it's not a motivator. It's not a decision-maker. If it was, frankly again  - why would I have broken up with you? To look at things aggressively logically and dispassionately - you spent most nights with me. She lives 600+ miles away. If I was motivated by "getting some" I'd stay with the person with whom I ~could~ on a regular basis.  	I broke up with you for the reasons I said. 	M______ was coming to visit anyway, I hadn't told her about you yet, so I just let it ride. 	I told you I was going to be alone, the only lie I ever told you, because I knew it would upset you that I had a woman coming to visit, and I just thought ... 	Again, honesty. 	Yes, I thought it would hurt your feelings, and I didn't want to do that. 	Also, I spit on myself, it was easier to lie to you than to have an honest conversation about how I was feeling and what I was doing. I should've just been honest with you  - all along, with only a very few exceptions, I've been honest with you about who I really am. But this time I was ashamed of myself and selfish, and so I hid so you wouldn't have to see and ask, and be angry at me. 	I was too cowardly to be honest about who I am.  	I had a friend coming to town to hang out, and I knew which way it could go if I wanted to. I didn't go searching this out, and if she hadn't been coming to town I wouldn't've gone looking for someone else. But what was, was.   	R_____. 	A week ago I was in love with you and holding you close. Days later I was in love with you and letting go of you. Tonight I love you [go ahead and be angry. I told you - there is nothing here for you but the unvarnished truth] and hate myself for lying to you. 	What happens when we are apart - what each one of us does now that we are not together - has nothing to do one with the other of us. I should have respected you as a person and someone I care for enough to give you the truth and let you handle it yourself. Between telling myself that it would hurt you, and just not wanting to have you angrier at me, I took the coward's way and lied to you.  	I am horribly, horribly sorry for that.   	But for that only. Because on my blood, I have told you here all the truth. I was not lying to you when I broke up with you. I had no ulterior motives. None. 	I am too aware that you don't believe me. Or, at least, again - I assume you don't.  	But it's the truth.   	You know my self-loathing. You know my hate. You know my readiness to appologize for everything under the sun. 	I am telling you - - I did not do THAT.         		just listened to your voicemail 		I was right

      	All along, dating you, I didn't know which way things were going to go. I liked you desperately when I first met you; when you hadn't much use for "a member of the crowd;" when you told me we couldn't be together; when you let me back in to your life. Then, too, I was confused - you were indifferent, then mildly interested, then wanted nothing of me, then wanted me back around. We'd go a week having a great time, then we'd seemed to misalign and things'd get edgy and unpleasant. Back and forth. And, always, the hardly-under-at-all undercurrent that there wasn't a future. From you telling me that when you broke things off the first time, to both of us joking about it while we were together, I really thought that the whole thing was very, very transient for you. I liked you an awful lot, but I knew myself what the relationship was, inasmuch as what it ~had~ to be, in the end. I knew the pain that I was headed towards, but I preferred not to think about it, and just enjoy my time with a girl I was liking more and more. More the fool, I. 	There's a cd in my car that I've been listening to idly. It's one of two I was trying to make back, I believe, when you were in Florida. One of the times we were apart, anyway. Maybe Chicago. Anyway, the point is it's from about a month ago, during a period I was quite, quite sure that things between you and I were about to end. I didn't know which one of us would say something first, but it seemed obvious to me that somebody would have to - you and I were bickering a bit, just not really getting along that well. Miles apart. No future. Why continue to upset each other. 	The cd in my car is of the "life goes on" variety. The "tonight as I'm sitting alone and you're miles away and we're not talking so I think I'll slit my wrists" cd never quite came together the way I wanted it to. Or, rather - it failed to come together, exactly the way I didn't want it to. 	Do you remember the day you were upset about not meeting the author that came to your office? D__ M_____, something like that? I don't know if you believed what I said to you online - I really, honestly, believed that you wanted a date with this guy - that you found him attractive and wanted a chance to be with him. I was ~aching~, sitting at my computer, but I was doing my best to convince you to do the right thing for yourself. I knew that I wasn't your future, and I cared about you too much to try to hold you back from a possible reality. So there I sat, trying to talk the girl I liked and enjoyed being with [and wished I could be with for so much longer] into going out on a date with an other guy, one she seemed truly to like and want. 	Not a pleasant day. 	But, things cycled back around. "Not the right time; there'll be other chances to meet him," you said, and that was that. You and I were "us" again, although with another loud "not for long" statement ringing in my ears. And I just assumed that this was your point of view. And so we had our time together, and I loved you as much as I was able to consciously, and more than that subconsciously, and that was that. 	And then you told me you loved me. 	I was so happy that night - I'd known you cared for me, but I always assumed it was a lighter care, no different than you felt for the friends you love too. But now to look at this woman of whom I'd grown increasingly enamoured, and hear that she felt something for me like I felt for her - love despite it all - ... I ached with that warmth. 	Since I first noticed you, and wished you'd notice me too, all I wanted was for you to feel about me something like I felt about you. 	I basked in that all night long.  	By the next day, it'd begun to sink in - I'd started to give real consideration to what it all meant. Although what I'd wanted, it wasn't anything I was ready for. Always overzealous in my life, overstepping, overreaching - I am all too guilty of that in the arena of relationships, in matters of the heart. I'm not making excuses for myself - it's immaterial either way - but wanting to be loved so badly, you try for it even when you shouldn't, even though you shouldn't. 	I knew then we had to stop. 	I'd know all along that eventually we would. I'd thought, often, that we should immediately - as you'd done; there's logic and reason to saying "I'm stopping before this starts to hurt." I kept putting it off, because one more day of happiness was worth it, when I was measuring immediate, real happiness, against eventual, as-yet-hypothetical pain. Not truly hypothetical, of course - I knew that we'd fall apart, and I knew with the horrid certainty born of living it before, that it'd hurt. Horribly. 	Anyway - "then." I knew it had to stop, because of too many reasons. Like I told you before - the feelings and hurt remaining in me from my past relaionships were difficult enough to deal with while I was just "really liking" someone I was seriously dating. There wasn't any way I could handle them as well as ~love~. And I know my weakness, my poor recovery skills - those old feelings weren't going to suddenly vanish; I wasn't going to abruptly or even relatively quickly let them go. So I knew that what would suffer would be myself, as always, and the people closest to me, the person trying to be closer to me. And even as I wanted you against me, I knew that it'd go badly - that I would screw up, hurt you worse, just ... just fail. Badly. Like I said - something I've done before. And I learned my lesson there - not, yet, how to get over the old hurts - but at the very least, not to allow somebody to get hurt by me. 	So, knowing that now it was so much more serious than it had been, I knew it had to stop.	 	Added to that, of course, was my own selfish fear of the eventual pain. Also, to be fair, my desire to spare you the same. I had, twice in my life, had to say goodbye to someone I was currently in love with, desperately, and wanting with everythign in me for there to be a tomorrow. Not like the usual "I still have feelings for you but it's just not working out" that we've all done. I mean being absolutely 100% ~in love~ and still having to walk away. Because there comes a point when you just have to accept reality, accept your fate and start trying to get on with life. Questions like children and god have irrefutable answers - there's no compromise on the absolutes. On some of the in-betweens, maybe  - 2 and 4 could be resolved to 3 children without either person being ~particularly~ upset by the change, because it's still degrees of the same opinion. 0 and Any, though  -  there's no working them together to resemble anything like what they were before. 	I've known, twice before in my life, that no matter what ~I~ wanted so badly, there wasn't any future to be had. And from those two times in my life, I knew that the longer you wait, the worse it gets. 	So I knew that you and I had to say goodbye. It had to happen someday - I felt it had to happen before love grew any further. 	Maybe I was wrong. Maybe you disagree. 	I did what I thought I had to do. For my own heart, for yours though you'd disagree, but yeah, for my own. To be honest, I still stand by it. It's not pleasant, it hurts like hell. 	But I know for a fact that in 4 months, it'd hurt worse. I can't say for sure how much worse, and I can't say for sure if the joy we'd had together wouldn't be worth the increased pain - but you can't say for sure you know the reverse wouldn't be true. Always in life you make a choice relatively blind - you work off your assumptions, conclusions, beliefs, ideas - - but in the end, you just close your eyes and jump.  	I have now, 3 times in my life, had to say goodbye to someone when I wanted to say "I love you, never let me go." 	I miss you, something fierce.

      His: Libra: (Sept. 23—Oct. 23) You'll disprove the old chestnut about nice guys finishing last by losing consistently while being a gigantic prick. Hers: Scorpio: (Oct. 24—Nov. 21) It's hard to tell someone who's always been there for you that you're no longer in love with him, but that's why you'll hire a publicist.  "He wasn't a prick, and I didn't hire a publicist. Mainly because even if I wanted to, I couldn't even afford to hire myself, but also because I wasn't in love. Not yet. But all the same, it wasn't--or wouldn't, in the future have been--a good match. And I find myself very very heartsick."     I set this heartbreak aside so long, but always knew I'd have to finish it someday. I find, now, it grew. Fed in the darkness of the rear of my closet, learned my secrets and weaknesses, and watched my smiles to know what I'd miss most.
