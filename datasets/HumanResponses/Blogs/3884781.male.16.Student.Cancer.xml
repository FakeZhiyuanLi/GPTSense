       The soft metallic thump of the door latch echoed across the room each time the door swung into its frame: the only visible sign of a ghostly draft. The constant gentle hum of the computer permeated the air and was punctuated by the occasional burst of chattering keys on a keyboard. The stream of a birdâ€™s song from outside, muffled but still clean and clear, filtered through an open window.

      Sometimes we can take a step back from our lives and realise that we are only really very small and what we individually do has very little affect on the rest of the universe.   Whilst this can help us to put our own troubles and worries into context, it can also make us feel useless and without purpose.   However we should all remember it is a matter of scale. The most important people in our lives, our family, friends and others, have a huge impact on our lives; sometimes we cannot imagine life without them. This is what we are like to them.   We as individuals have a lot of power to make all the people we know happy and to positively assist them in their lives. So therefore each of our groups of family, friends and peers can be heavily affected by what we do, and when in some situations we can seem to be so small and useless, in others we have the potential to do great things.   I believe that every action we take has an affect on the rest of the world, be it very small or diminished. The small things we do in our lives to benefit other people, no matter what our motives are, all contribute to making the world a better place, even when we cannot see it.

      Hello and welcome to my first post. This, i promise, will not be terribly interesting, as the only real purpose of this post is to write some utter crap to start the ball rolling, and to test to see if this thing works.   let us start with one thing that really annoys me: people who make a habit of eating a Kitkat, without breaking it in half first.   Why?   The Kitkat is clearly designed to be broken into individual pieces to aide the ease of consumption.   What is the psychology behind this confusing habit? Leaving the Kitkat as a whole and attemping to eat it all at once is an arrogant gesture, a sign that you feel you are superior to other Kitkat eaters, and therefore do not need to break it in half in some pandering to convention. But this convention makes sense! Who wants to see some idiot attempt to stuff a whole Kitkat in his mouth and get half the chocolate arround his mouth instead of in it, just because it looks clever?   Or it could be that you just couldn't be bothered, which frankly is even worse. I have nothing to say to you accept BURN SOME OF THOSE CALORIES, BREAK IT IN HALF! Having said all this, it could just be an attempt to 'mark yourself out of the crowd' which is just sad, GET A LIFE!

      The camping adventure park we eventually ended up going to, was the aptly named "River Dart Adventure Park" on the outskirts of Dartmoor. It was one of those places, like Disneyland and the like, that has an atmosphere of enforced happiness. "We're on holiday! Of course we're happy!" The trouble is that I seem to have an intolerance of these places - for me they have exactly the reverse affect, they just make me miserable. I seem to be the only one left out from whatever magic is in the air, and all I can see is the cynical capitalism driving it all. So needless to say I didn't find it very much fun.  However the weather this time was good. Too good. It was sweltering hot and even taking a sip out of my 70p (rip off!) chilled cola can was exhausting. Everyone in the campsite wandered about like sleepy sloths whilst the sun slapped down upon our burnt backsides. I took a dip in the tiny swimming pool to cool down. A few minutes later my eyes were burning like hell and my hair had the texture of straw, plus, when it had dried my beautiful blond highlights had gone green.  I got out when some kid loudly declared he was going to 'warm' his wetsuit. In other words he pissed in it.  For the rest of the holiday I sheltered in my tent, reading the paper and strumming some chords on my guitar from time to time. I successfully avoided having a 'fun' game of badminton or for that matter doing any physical activity whatsoever, apart from swatting the odd wasp.  When it eventually came to the last day I was so ecstatic that I somehow managed to break the indicator light on my dad's new car. He was furious. The journey home was just one long let's bollock James fest. All my faults were carefully explored and put down in the end to me being a complete idiot.  So let this be a warning to you - don't go camping, it'll always end in tears!

      I have just arrived home after what can only be described as my worst camping experience to date, (and I thought the last time was bad). Yes, last Thursday I happily jumped into the car at the prospect of getting away from Yeovil for a few days, but all too easily forgot my last encounter with camping.  About a year ago my Dad decided it would be jolly nice if we all went for a lovely 'low effort' camping holiday to Tintagal (a small town in Cornwall where King Arthur was supposedly born) as an answer to the cries of "Why can't we go on holiday" and "I'm bored" that issued endlessly from my sisters.  Big mistake.  Within hours we had discovered that our pitch literally teetered over the edge of a cliff that plunged to an inviting (yes it was that bad) rocky outcrop and the sea. Inevitably the tent took ages to put up, my labeling system was obviously not as clear as I had thought, and then it started raining.  Soon we were rolling into town through thick sleet and fog having given up on the tent, trying to find a cozy pub, or similar, to eat at. My Dad eventually gave up trying to find anything cozy, he commented that half the town seemed to have disappeared since he had been there last - probably swept into the sea. So in the end the chip shop it was.  That night my Dad developed food poisoning, and a bad back from holding the tent up to stop it blowing away. His insufferable optimism took a knock too.  You can imagine the rest.  Well this time my Dad said it would be better. Well for him it would be - his girlfriend plus family were going to come too. He also decided that was would go to one of those 'adventure park' themed sites, "Lots for the kids to do, it'll be fun!"  Well unfortunately, I don't know about you, but capsizing in the middle of a filthy, freezing artificial lake with no hot showers in the immediate vicinity and with a bank of people jeering and shouting at you, does not constitute fun.   Catch the rest of my shocking tale, in the next episode of, "My Campsite Hell: How Camping Nearly Killed Me!"
