      Don't you just love Mondays?   They're full of possibilities. A fresh, clean white sheet of paper to type our destinies on. Everything is new and wonderful and exciting.  What a load of crap.  I hate Mondays. Even though, this particularly Monday is just after we've put the clocks forward. Which allegedly means we get more sleep (doesn't feel any different to me). However, now it's dark at, like, 5 p.m. Getting us ready for the dump of snow which is only weeks away.  Arghh.  I need to plan a vacation or something.

      I made a new journal for NaNoWriMo. I think it's best. It'll be  urlLink right here.     I'm experimenting with doing proper links. It may work, it may not. I am a PRINT designer, not a WEB designer. HTML hurts my wittle head. It was enough for me just to find a template I sort of liked.  Tra la la.

      I've just joined a writing contest. The reward seems to be the happiness of getting something accomplished.    http://nanowrimo.org/index.php   Basically, the idea is to buckle up and write a 50,000 word novel during the month of November. It can be a horribly bad novel, as long as its 50,000 words. I know I can write horribly. The question is can I write horribly on a deadline?  We shall see. I will post my word counts here hopefully.  Today I'm leaning towards the one-bedroom-plus-den option for my condo. The two bedroom has its perks: walk-in closet, extra bedroom, better view; but is that really worth the major price difference? Or should I get the lesser of the two and get stainless steel appliances and a plasma television? So many choices. So much time to procrastinate. The important thing is that I have been budgeting myself better. No major eBay spendage lately. Unless you count the LoTR sword I purchased for my cousin. But that was with his money, not mine. Cool sword, though, if you're into that sort of thing.  My only "extravagance" this week was buying the new Clay Aiken CD. It's not bad. Couldn't find the MP3's so I coughed up the cash at HMV instead. Once a year won't hurt anybody.  Okay, back to my thankless job. My project for the afternoon -- Award-entry labels! Wow. Exciting stuff.

      I saw "Pirates of the Carribean" for the second time on the weekend. There are very few movies lately that I'd want to see (and pay for) twice, but that was one of them. Forget about the whole love story between the govenor's daughter and that elf-dude. It's Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Swann that I find fascinating. Definitely a very memorable role. JD's been in so many movies that I love. Just watched a bit of Edward Scissorhands tonight. Not a great movie IMO, but he was awesome. A few others off the top of my head: Chocolat, Don Juan DiMarco, Sleepy Hollow, just recently in Once Apon A Time in Mexico... and he's rumored to be in the move adaptation of "Good Omens" (co-written by Neil Gaiman, thank you very much). Oh, and we can't forget 21 Jump Street. Truly television history in the making.  New topic: my being late. I've been at a job that bitches at me for being five minutes late for six whole years. Do I ever do anything to improve my punctuality? Well, sometimes. But it only lasts for a few days at best. What kind of a job bitches over being that teensy meensy little amount of time late? Don't get me started. Anyhoo, I want to make a definitive effort to improve my mornings. This includes, but is not limited to, getting up a little more than ten minutes before I have to leave the house in the morning. I am not a morning person, agreed. But after eight years of working full time I should be bloody well used to it. It is no longer an excuse. Besides, if I was miraculously suddenly able to be at my desk promptly at 8:30 am I wouldn't be doing it so things run smoothly between myself and management. It would be so I don't get so damned stressed out. I'm becoming one of those road rage people because I don't leave myself enough time to get from point a to point b. Plus I have to think about what the line-up at Tim Horton's is going to be. Michelle cannot exist without her large coffee first thing in the morning. Amen to that. All I have to do is leave the house at 7:50 am. Must do. Must do.  Starting tomorrow. Or, at the very latest... Wednesday. Stamped it, no erasies.  BTW, the whole "I must write on the weekend" thing never really panned out. I am so lazy.

      It's Saturday. The last week was really long and tiring, even though it was a four day week. Why is it that weeks after a long weekend seem to drag on endlessly even though they're a day shorter than regular weeks? I do not know.  This weekend I intend (even though it's already 2:35 pm and I haven't done anything more than watch a taped episode of "Alias" and "What Not To Wear") to actually get my butt down in my chair and write something more involved than this journal entry. I have received positive feedback for my "bad beginnings" historical romance from both my personal editor/friend B, and my Australian writer buddy J. I've removed it from the site so I can more fully look at it and peruse the possibilities of it becoming more than just 1400 wasted words.  I'm planning on doing an eBay blitz soon. I have a whole hell of a lot of things I want to sell. All the better for me to save up my downpayment for the condo. I know I'm not moving in for a year and a half but it's strangely exciting. I never thought I'd get to the point where I wanted to have a big fat mortgage, but I guess it just had to come with age. And time. And frustration.

      I've been trying to update my website. I mean, why even bother having a website if you don't update it every year. Mine looks pretty sucky. If I can figure out this html java crap things are going to be good. Thank God for that site, what's it called, with the templates. I forget. It's still difficult. I'm tired.

      Ever gone through carb withdrawal?  This is my second day on the famous South Beach Diet and I'm at the point where I would literally kill the next person who looks at me funny. I have a headache the size of something very large and angry. I feel a little woozy. I really want a donut.  Why do I do this to myself?  Arghhh.  Why can't I just eat normally, like healthy-ish with the occasional treat. But, nooooooo, it's all or nothing for me. I live in a black and white world. It's either McDonalds or rice cakes. (and with low carb I can't even have rice cakes!)  Okay, breathe. I know if I just stick with this for the rest of today, tomorrow the withdrawl will be over. How do I know?  BECAUSE I'VE BEEN ON EVERY DIET IN THE UNIVERSE AT LEAST TWICE!!! THAT'S HOW!!!  Ahem. Sorry.  I've been working out with a personal trainer for five months now. Three times a week. I feel stronger. However, I've now proven the theory that you can't lose weight by personal trainer alone.  I need to get my fat ass in gear once and for all. I'm not getting any younger (despite the fact that I keep telling people I am).  I am so fed up with it all. FED UP!!!!!! I don't have to look like some blonde skinny movie star to be happy! ARGHHHHHH!!!!  Will I stick with the South Beach Diet?? According to my track record that's a big fat-assed NOOOOO!!!!  So why do I bother? Why do I put myself through this all of the time when I know I'm just going to be met with more failure?  ***thinks***  Hey, hope springs eternal. I give it today. Today!!!! If I live to see tomorrow, maybe I'll do it tomorrow too. Bloody hell, and Xmas is one month from today.  I need a hobby.

      Well looky here. Another Monday. Strange how quickly the little bastards rear their ugly heads.  I feel calm. Fairly collected. Ready to face a new week without going postal. I think.  If it wasn't for my NaNo, I don't know what I'd do. Please see other journal ---> for further description.  Happily I'm not being dragged on the "BIG PITCH" today. I don't play well in crowds. Then again, what does it say that they don't want their Senior Designer along for the ride? I will not overthink this. I had a few dreams over the weekend that left me with the conclusion that I should be happy to be working here. The world outside these doors is perhaps a scary thing. The devil you know vs. the devil you don't. Or something like that.  I plan on spending the day making floorplans look pretty on their insert sheets and absorbing myself with the Nanowrimo forums.  Friday cannot come too soon.

      Things got better after the last post. Whenever I have a really bad day it's followed immediately by a good day. That's why I've been here for so long.  I'm slacking on my Nano. Got to pick that puppy up and run with it. I don't have anything after work tonight so I can get down to business. One hopes.

      Did I mention that I hate Mondays?  I'm starting to think I may need to find another job. For such a small place there are way too many office politics. I agreed to go to a dinner that my boss had bought a table to support a local politician. That was Friday. Since then I've discovered said politician is not someone I want to be seen supporting. So this morning I bailed on the dinner. I could have told my boss that I had other plans, but I instead stupidly said I didn't want to go because of political reasons. I should have known she'd sulk about this.  My immediate manager (who thinks we're buddies) closed my door to give me her two cents which is: I'm supporting my boss and not the politician and I shouldn't just not go. And blah blah blah.  Bottom line, I'm not political. I could care less if someone's going to tear up nature to build a highway (well, I suppose I care a little). But I really didn't want to go to the dinner because I really don't want to socialize with these crazy people any more that I have to. I just used the political line to vaguely sound like I have an opinion about anything more than what I like to eat for breakfast (presently, a chocolate chip muffin).  So there. I'm not going, and they can't make me.  >

      I'm relatively new in the world of blogging. I've kept a journal on and off since I was in grade six and that was (hard to believe) going on twenty years ago. Blogging is new. It's public and it's intriguing to me as I've read various blogs on my daily surfing of the internet every morning before I settle down to give my 40% at work.  One of the blogs I've been reading lately is Holly Lisle's. She's a profilic fantasy writer, and though I have yet to read anything by her, I admire her advice to writers and her vast amount of words she has put forth. She's recently abandonned her blog, her semi-daily journal of her writing and personal life. Her reasons are sound and interesting and valid. Basically it was taking away from her work. She spent so much time on-line, doing on-line things, that she was losing that part of herself that was the work itself.  Ever since I first got on the internet with my 14.4k modem back in 1996 or so, I've been part in love with it and part repelled by it. It's a sea of information. Something you can plunge into and swim around merrily for hours and hours without ever losing sight of the shore. But, when you finally do get out of the water, you find that the day is gone and you've got a bad sunburn on your back.  I'm in a bad metaphor mood.  My point is this. (if I actually do have a point). For the most part, the internet is one big, fat waste of my precious time. I spent money on it: eBay, Chapters.ca, etc. I spend my attention on it: slayage.com, anything buffy related... I spend valuable time on worthless activities: strangemuse.com... Do I really NEED a website? No. How long did I spend putting together strangemuse for a few people to glance at? Hours and hours. What purpose does it serve other than stroking my ego and telling me that my life has not be for nothing? It serves no purpose whatsoever. Nada.  In a little over a month and a half I will turn thirty-three years of age. 33. That's seven little years away from forty. I feel like I am still a teenager. But you know what? I'm not.  I've been living in a dreamworld. A self-imposed, delusional dreamworld. I've built a very comfortable cocoon around myself built of toys and games and lies. I lie to myself. All of the time. Nothing but lies. It's all bullshit.  Now, what was my point? What does this have to do with Holly Lisle and my website and this new blog of mine?  None of it means anything. It's all sand. Sand on the beach that I can see while I'm out here, wading in the water. Surfing the waves. Wasting my time, my youth, my life. All distractions to keep me from focusing on what's really important.  And what's that? What's important Michelle. Tell us, enlighten us. Share with the class.  I don't know.  I've spent so much of my life hiding from it, I have absolutely no idea what's important anymore. All I know is that it's not this. Not typing words in to a stupid blog that no one will read save for myself who looks at it after it's uploaded to make sure that there's no excessive grammatical errors JUST IN CASE somebody stops by for a look see.  All bullshit.  B.S.  And I always tell myself... you're going to be a writer. It'll all be worth it then. Oh yeah? Hmmm, except for November, you haven't written two words. I'm such a pathetic poser. I'm a big fat nothing. I'm a flat, blank piece of paper that words can't stick to.  So, until I figure things out, I'm going to back away. Move away from the non-real digital world before it completely comsumes me. I need to re-establish myself in the real world. Unplug me Neo. Click my heels together. There's no place like home.

      Well, Christmas has passed for another year and I find myself sitting here on Boxing Day wondering what to do with all my new stuff.  I did all right. I got:  Two DVDs: Pirates of the Carribean and LoTR: The Two Towers. Cinderella Bunnykins Swarovski crystal typewriter Tons of socks A really cool parrot candy dish. Doesn't sounds so good, but trust me, it's really cool. Salt and pepper shakers that look like two pieces of toast in a toaster. Love it. Plus, a whole bunch of other stuff.  Today I'm just relaxing. I'm still getting over my lovely little case of the flu that I've been stuck with for a week today. Next year, I swear I'm going to get the flu shot. On a happy note, I have lost five pounds thanks to it.  I just got an email from eBay saying that it's free listing day. I may put some stuff up. I have a bunch of Buffy cards I still want to get rid of. NO MORE COLLECTING. I swear. I mean it.  I have to go back to work on monday, tuesday and part of wednesday. Then I'll be off for five days. Then I'll have to start thinking about my new year's resolutions.   So hope everyone had a lovely Christmas and lots of turkey. Watched "World Idol" last night. I think that Ryan Malcolm did us proud. Zack Warner's a dick, but I already knew that. I hope Kelly Clarkson doesn't win. She bugs me for some reason. I thought the chick from Poland sung the best, although I hated the song. Evita? Come on.  Okay, that's all for now... :-)

      I have my  urlLink Flipside  idea. I think it has potential. But, what the hell do I know? I will begin writing it on January the 1st, just as soon as the inevitable hangover subsides. (Then again, since no plans for New Year's have yet reared their ugly little heads, I may be gingerale-ing it with the 'rents -- Dick Clark, baby, come to mama).  I've signed up for  urlLink National Novel Writing Year.  Don't know if I'm going to take that one as seriously (for lack of a better word) as I did NaNoWriMo. If I do, by the end of 2004 I will have completed two 50,000 word novels, as well as a 100,000 word one. Ye gads.  I've been editing  urlLink Yellow Brick Roadkill  in the hopes of doing a perfect bound version of it for some unlucky friends and family members for Christmas. And you know what? The novel ain't half bad. That is to say, one half is unbearably bad and the other is kinda good. Maybe I'll just put a nice warm scarf and some mitts on it and send it out into the cold cruel world of unsolicited manuscripts. My sanity's long gone, so what else do I have to lose?  I'm almost finished my Xmas shopping, which is for me, quite an accomplishment. Tomorrow's the day I get it done completely. Then I can relax and get back to only spending money on myself. And, right, the condo fund. Argh.

      Still working out my idea for my Flipside romance novel. I wanted to see what Harlequin considers "good" stories, so i condensed the the plots of their first six books into one sentence each:  ---  1. Runaway Bride unwittingly falls far the brother of one of her jilted fiances who’s out for revenge.   2. Hopeless romantic plays hard to get with her inconsiderate dream man and finally realizes boy next door is for her.   3. Girl decides that hot guys are evil and geeks are in, but the geek she’s picked isn’t ready to be stereotyped that easily.   4. The crush she gave up her dreams for re-enters her life just as she’s finished with damage control.   5. Exciting man (who’s out to get her company with his investigative journalism) is a breath of fresh air in her otherwise drab and boring life.    6. Girl decides to give in and manage one of her family’s hotels, but it’s not as easy as that as her co-manager is a jerk and definitely not going to give her an easy time just because she’s a VIP.  ---  Now, I just need to come up with something similar. Starring Hugh Grant. And probably Sandra Bullock or Meg Ryan.

      I just bought myself a new toy.  I know, I know, I'm saving for the condo....blah blah-dee blah.  But, in a way, this will *help* me with the condo because it will aid my blossoming writing career.  My (how the hell do you make a link again?...ah, here we go...) My  urlLink AlphaSmart 3000  is on its way to me right now.  "But," you may say, "Michelle, dear, aren't you already the proud owner of an expensive Powerbook that can actually burn DVDs although you currently have no need for that feature you spent an extra $500 on?"  To which I would reply: "Uh yeah. But this little puppy will allow me to just type with no distractions like the internet or games."  "Then," you continue, "Why didn't you just get this in the first place and use the money you spent on the computer to further your condo fund."  And I would roll my eyes at you because you are a silly little fool. "Because the Alphasmart is just to enhance my experience with the computer. It's an additional tool for my writing arsenal. And fuck off, it's my money."  Then you would walk away angrily by the way I'd expressed myself and we wouldn't speak for weeks.  So, bottom line, I'm happy. And I don't go to the casino anymore, so if I like to buy my little toys every now and then, so be it. :-)

      I showed my mini Zen sand garden to a co-worker the other day. I keep it by my keyboard for particularly stressful moments during the day when all I can do is rake nice little pretty paths and place the three mice-shit-like pebbles into pleasing arrangements.  While I was showing said co-worker this marvel of stress relief,  I managed to pour half the contents of onto my keyboard.  Despite my deep grasp of the workings of macintosh computers I have never been able to get away from one fact.  Keyboards are terribly unforgiving.  Case in point: a tiny splash of water or a non-sugarbased beverage like diet coke. Take the keyboard and leave it upside down to dry for a couple of days. It should be fine.  A large amount of water and/or sugar-based drink like Coke. Save your time and spend your money on a new keyboard because it's fried.  This is the first time I've had to deal with sand.  That was two days ago. Now, with every tap of the keys I get a gritty nails-on-the-chalkboard sound. My - and + keys are sticking so if I don't watch it they'll do something along the lines of: ++++++++++++++++===== before I have to wedge the key up with a paper clip.  But, you know what? I'm going to deal. I'm not asking for another keyboard.  And, yes, this is a boring entry. And your point?

      I've decided to become a writer.  This isn't news. I've wanted to be a writer since I was ten and tried to write an addition to the Enid Blyton "Adventure" series.  But I've always wanted to "be" a writer. In other words, skip over all the hard stuff and have all the good stuff that comes after the real work.  I think twenty years have proven to me that it's not that easy.  So... I'm going to journal about my journey into the writing world. Taking myself seriously. Taking my goals seriously.  Fashion and build my career instead of thowing the dart and hoping it doesn't boomerang back and hit me in the eye.   The Rules  1. To be a writer you need to write.  2. To be a writer you need to write books that have a chance at being published and therefore making money off of them. 3. You need to have an idea of what you would like to write. 4. You need to have an idea of what sells. 5. Write. 6. Revise. 7. Find an agent. But agents don't like to work with unpublished authors. 8. Find a publisher. But publishers don't like to work with unagented authors.  Hmmm. A quandry.  9. Network with other people in the publishing industry so you are no longer just a name on a query letter. 10. Send work to publishers that will accept unagented work.  Okay. So that is where I am right now.  I will send a book to somewhere that will embrace me for the novice novelist that I am.  And full circle back to Harlequin.  Good old Harlequin. I always fancied being a writer for Harlequin. Two hundred pages of a simple formula. Boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back.  How hard can that be?  Ever tried reading one of them? Well, since this journal will probably be only for my eyes only, the answer is...yes. Several times. They bored me to tears.  Flash forward to now. Here I am. I want to become a published writer who actually makes enough money one day (let's talk five year plan here) to quit her day job.  Enter 'Flipside.' Harlequin's revamp of their 'Love and Laughter' line. Comedy romances. Funny stuff with fun and interesting characters. They list several 'examples' including some of my favorite movies. As well as some sitcoms I watch on a regular basis.  I can write a comedy romance. Sure I can. And I'm going to come up with the plot today.  It begins.  Here are some suggestions from Harlequin Editors on what to do and not to do when submitting to them:     From Slush to Published  by Carrie Hunter  It's perfect. Your manuscript�� you've invested hours of research, writing and editing all with one goal: creating a believable and entertaining story. You work up the courage to submit it to a publishing house. Then you hear�nothing. You're stumped.   This holiday season, we asked some of our editors to share their thoughts on what manuscript attributes top their wish lists. What they had to say just might surprise you!    The Basics   Ensure your manuscript is clean of grammatical errors and offers fresh writing, engaging characters and a plot without holes.   Proper presentation goes a long way. Remember the following format:   *	Double-space your manuscript. *	Use a legible 12 point font. *	Number the pages.  *	Use spell check. *	Proofread your manuscript (�to catch those errors that spell check misses).  *	Include a self-addressed, stamped envelope that is large enough for the return of your manuscript. *	Write your address somewhere in the submission other than on the outer envelope. Imagine if Harlequin wanted to buy your project, but couldn't get in touch with you! *	Present a writing style that has a personal feel to it�� as if the reader were a part of the secret.     From the Editors   Writing and Grabbing the Spotlight   "Write something you're passionate about. How can an editor to fall in love with your story if you're not crazy about it yourself?"   "Start with something interesting and directly relating to the romance. I can't stand to be deluged with background, set-up and/or a ton of subsidiary characters when I want my romance. Not only that, a good first line can be a writer's best friend."   "A way with words that brings the scent and taste and sight and sound to my mind."   "Scene and chapter endings that either leave a sigh of satisfaction at a beautiful moment or leave me on tenterhooks until I turn the page and keep reading."   "Smarts! Smart writing, smart characters, smart situations. No more conflict generated by keeping a secret only the hero or heroine cares about! No more walking unarmed into the dark room instead of turning around and calling the cops! We all act like idiots occasionally, but I'd rather read about a smart woman who knows she's being an idiot."    Voice   "Create a voice that is both unique and really gripping/captivating/interesting. I'm a sucker for good dialogue. I want characters to sound real and like themselves, not like types or every other character out there."   "Voice�� something distinctive or evocative about the way the author expresses the familiar or even clich�d."    Characters/Characterization  "Create fully realized characters with whom the editor/reader can identify with�� the characters have to resonate with the reader"   "A strong, capable heroine who doesn't break down and whine all the time."   "A gruff, wounded hero who needs to be healed emotionally and physically."   "Characters so real I want to move next to them!"   "A sense of humor that makes me laugh with the characters."   "Watching a great personality jump off the page! A lot of writers seem to think personality can only be shown in dialogue.� What sets a winning submission apart is when even the exposition sounds like someone's talking. In historicals that could mean maintaining a mild period syntax; in contemporaries, using appropriate slang to convey age or setting. Don't let the characterization stop outside the quotation marks!"    Moving Along: Creating Plot   "Emotion. Show how the hero/heroine respond to major turning points."   "Plotting that is fresh, intriguing and engrossing."   "Pacing, pacing, pacing! Writers write because they love their characters, and sometimes that means they tell too much up front. Nothing's better than starting a submission, thinking I'll read a page or two, and glancing up what feels like five minutes later to see that I've read 100 pages without noticing."

      Well, November is officially over. That means my (so-called) novel is finished.   Which also means, back to my regular journal!  Yippy.  Today is a Monday. The first monday in December. I'm sitting here in my office listening to John Cougar Mellancamp on the Mix 99.9.  I'm doing a calendar. Designing it, that is.  Today at lunch (in about 45 minutes) I think I'll go over to Chapters. Ooh, there's a news flash.  I'm still on my own hybrid version of the south beach diet. I had to add a little sugar in the morning or I felt like ca-ca. Now, I just feel like crap.  Was going to buy some more personal training sessions since the gym had a pretty good deal on. Alas, a 'pretty good deal' is 2 grand. I'm a little strapped with saving up for the condo, so I decided to not buy the sessions.  Does this mean I'm a grown up now? The fact that I'm saving for something important like a place to live?  Christ, I'd better buy an action figure or something on my lunch. Luckily Toys 'R Us is right next to Chapters.  =^..^= meow.

      Query update: One rejection and one redirection (I'd queried a gal who only deals with picture books, she gave me the name of someone else in her office, so you can bet that I'll drop her name in the new letter... "So-in-so suggested that I send you this..."  My savings are going well so far this year. It helps that there's so much snow on the ground that I can't be bothered to go out shopping. The condo's official now. Therefore I've been  having dreams about getting fired from my job left, right and centre. I even had a dream that my old boss from eight years ago fired me. He was a pompous dick. Why can't I dream about Hugh Jackman?

      And another week begins full of vim and vigour.  Or, at least, caffeine and donuts.  I am feeling rather positive about my trilogy finding it's way in the cold cruel world. I'm feeling negatively about just about everything else, but I did need my prescription renewed anyhow. Perhaps tomorrow I will feel positive. Positively negative.  I have to go to the gym in about fifteen minutes. I don't know why I bother. Even though I'm working out with a personal trainer, I'm just not seeing anything changing. Body-wise. It could harken back to the caffeine and donuts comment, but why why why???? I need Julian McMahon to come at me with his liposuction hose. Hmmm. Mind out of gutter now.  Truly though, this whole condo thing has been very stressful. I don't deal well with stress. In fact, I've managed to cocoon myself away for a whole week and a half with barely any contact with the outside world. Strangely enough, I prefer living life that way, but it is frowned upon by other less socially inept people. Blah blah blah.  What else is new? I've been accessing all of my "knick knacks" and deciding what of my precious goodies will go up on eBay to help pay for a couch and my closing costs. I'm thinking anything that reeks of Buffy the vampire slayer that isn't permanently etched into my hip. The market doesn't suck too bad for the Buffy stuff. I'll unload it all while I still can. It was all more fun to collect than to own, anyhow. I'm just passing it along to the next lucky person.  What's on tonight after I drag my ass home from the gym? Fear Factor "Couples" edition. Make me puke. And then, I think the Average Joe is on tonight. God, I love that show. I think the boatload of hotties arrives tonight. Really puts life into perspective. There are the hotties, and there are the average Joes. And not a hell of a lot in between. Survivor "All Stars" should be starting soon too. Go Rich. I really love Reality T.V.  And I think we've already established that I'm badly in need of a life. But, since I'm no spring chicken anymore (bite thy tongue, wench!), perhaps I should just settle for a really nice large-screen t.v.  On that note... Off to the gym I go!

      Well. I did it.  I bought a condo.  Lord help me.  It's still not all finalized, but it's looking pretty good. They wanted an extra 5% on construction which they didn't tell me about during the past year I've been stalking them at the office, so I say "Nyet. No. Not a chance." That's the only thing that's holding up proceedings. Hey, if I had the extra 5%, I can think of a lot better things to do with it than give it to them for a project that won't even be (potentially) finished for a year and a half.  I even saw a lawyer yesterday about all the forms. I feel just like a grown up. Which, since I'm turning the big 3-3 next month, is probably a little late coming.  So, basically I've gotten the ball rolling on this.  It may become one of those big heavy balls that chased Indiana Jones through the tunnel, but let's hope it doesn't get that bad.  On a sad note, that means VERY limited extra cash for Miss Michelle Spend-a-Lot. She is enrolling in a recovery program ASAP.

      Christ. I am such a whiner. Forget my last post.  New Year. New Me.  And all that crap.  Today I sent out eight query letters to various new york publishers. One of them has to want to see my novel, right? This isn't the NaNo one. This is the one I've been slaving over (read: procrastinating) for nearly four years. It's bloody good, dammit. And it may not make me rich, but it will be published by a decent house.  So, we'll have to wait and see. I went directly to publishers this time instead of the agents. The two I queried gave me a big headache with their dumb form letter rejections. They can bite my Young Adult writing ass.  No, I'm not bitter.  So, back to my thankless job tomorrow. I changed all the computers over to OS X last week and tomorrow's the first day we test things out. I plan on doing a SNL "Computer Guy" impression for most of the day. Uh... you're welcome. When did I become techie guru extraordinaire? And am I being paid for this facet of my already full-time job? Uh, no.  Oh well, what can you do? At least I got a G5 and a studio display flat screen out of the deal.  2004 is going to be a good year.  It is. Dammit.

      After a whirlwind revising session, I'm ALMOST ready to send the trilogy  out to Scholastic. I'm just polishing up my synopsises. Went to sleep last night at 2:00 a.m.   Today is my birthday. I don't have much more to say about that. I no longer like birthdays. I only wish I could get presents without having to age. I asked someone who only just met me how old they thought I looked. They took a moment, then said twenty-five. That made me very happy. Although, it could have been because of the knife I was holding to their throat. :::sigh::: Oh well, there's only one alternative to aging, isn't there. And that's becoming a vampire. I may look into that before next year. I've never much cared for daylight anyhow.    you are the "you suck, and that's sad" happy bunny. your truthful, but can be a bit brutal.     urlLink   which happy bunny are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Wow. Scholastic wants to see the trilogy. I'm very excited. Now I just have to shine it up real nice and pretty and get that puppy in the mail by the beginning of next week.  I'm not going to get my hopes up too high. Just because their one of my TOP THREE FRICKING PUBLISHERS!!   Relax. Breathe deep.   Think positive thoughts. That's right. Puppies and kitties and balloons.  And stress. Much stress.

      I'm in charge of the production department right now as my manager is on holiday. Ahhh, the power. Well, the department includes one designer other than myself so it's not exactly a kingdom, but still.  Hopefully I won't have much work. It looks like a lot on paper, but I don't think it's that much in reality. Lots of time to clean up and organize files and.... oh who am I kidding? Lots of time to be on the internet and playing games! La la la.  The trilogy "officially" arrived at Scholastic in New York last thursday. Arghh. What are the odds that they'll accept it? Slim to none? Breathe. Okay. The fact that they even wanted to see it sans agent is a good thing. I'm a step above the others in the slush pile. Also, it's complete. Other than a few blatent spelling errors I've only just noticed in book three, it's all good. So, I should be receiving their reply sometime between now...and a lot later than now. The big houses can take up to six months. Oh the humanity.  I need to buckle down and keep working on the other book that I'm writing for Writer's Digest School. My instructor's in her seventies, so I'd better hurry up and get the last assignment to her ASAP. I don't know why I'm such a procrastinator. Just am.

      So I managed to get through Thursday. Now here I am on Friday. The start of the long weekend. Hooray!  Now, what shall I do? Hmmm. I actually have no concrete plans. Usually when I have no plans I end up doing absolutely nothing. I know that tomorrow I'm going downtown Toronto to wander the underground PATH system since I'm using in in a novel and I need to know where the exits and entrances go to. So that will take about two hours. I want to see Hellboy but nobody else wants to see it. I hate going to the movies by myself. I've done it a couple of times and felt like a bit loser. Just me and my nachos with cheese. Oh, and the diet coke, of course.  I received my final assignment from the Writer's Digest Novel Writing Course back the other day. Not to brag, because I hate to brag...oh who am I kidding? My instructor said it was excellent and that she wouldn't even recommend my taking the Advanced writing course because I'm that damn good. Hell yeah. Now if I could just apply some bum glue and get my ass in the chair for a couple of quality hours a day I'd be laughing. With insanity. (Instead of giggling with insanity as is the usual case)  Bum glue. The difference between a successful writer and a wannabe. Writing every fricking day. I usually write for four hours one day a month. Is that wrong? Uh, yeah. I'd like to write some short stories. I can just pluck an idea out of my massive "idea" file. There's got to be a couple that I'm willing to go forward with.  I'd like to come up with another solid young adult idea. just in case Scholastic says yes. Then I can say...well, I have this other idea I'm working on...wouldn't you love to buy that up front? I have a few ideas kicking around but they're very rough.  Two more weeks and I'm on vacation. If I stay with this thankless job until December, I'll get four weeks vacay a year. What I'm looking for is a job where I can take one week vacation for every week worked. I think they call that unemployment.  Okay. I guess I'll go find something to do now. What time is Oprah on???

      No word from Scholastic yet. Hey, no news is good news I guess. Dial Books for Young Readers wants to see the first three chapters + synopsis so I, of course, obliged. Whoever accepts it first gets it. Crossing fingers that either wants it.  Work is sucking bad this week. Thank God it's a short week.  Not much else is new. I'm supposed to be doing my timesheet right now. I hate doing my timesheet. I hate Excel. Yes, I'm a positive girl. I'm procrastinating. I'm sitting here doing a blogger entry drinking my Tim Horton's double-double coffee and my granola bar thing and procrastinating the inevitable.  Six more hours till I'm free for Easter weekend. Woo.

      I heard from Dial Books for Young Readers today. See? I knew that no news was good news. Despite a lovely personalized letter, it was still a lovely personalized **rejection** letter. :::::heavy sigh::::::  The "assistant" editor felt that one of my two viewpoint characters was "unsympathetic." Well, the character starts out as a bully and a nemesis to my other character, but through the course of three books she does grow greatly as a person and learn many important lessons. It's hard to tell by just reading the first three chapters. I also have some mean popular girls in the book whom she said were "cliche." Blah blah blah. But she did say that it was an original story and her opinions may not be the opinions of another editor. Let's hope so. I still have Scholastic, and they don't just have three chapters. They have all six hundred pages o' fun.  It's too bad that Dial didn't say they'd look at it again if I adjusted the characters. She said she hoped her comments helped me with "future editors." She did not include herself in the bunch. All in all, her letter was nice enough. She didn't add any insult to injury, and...other than query letter rejections, it is my first "after they've read my work" rejection. Some writers get hundreds! I guess I'd better get used to it. Just part of the fun and exciting process of writing.  So, here's the plan. After I had a whole ten minutes of feeling sorry for myself I began to think that her comments may be constructive. If Scholastic rejects me like a dog in the dirt -- sometime between now and August -- I will go back and revise the character-in-question with more reader-sympathy in mind. Then... I'm going to get an agent. Let them deal with the editors.  :::another heavy sigh::::  Bottom line, I'm not giving up. No matter how long it takes me, I'm going to be a successful published novelist. I just need to pick up my pace a bit. I do a lot more "thinking" about what I'm going to write than the actual work of putting fingers to keyboard. So, let's get to it. If I have to be a graphic designer for the rest of my life I'm going to throw myself off the nearest cliff.

      Three months now and still no word from Scholastic. I can deal. I just have to put it out of my mind. But you know what? I find it so annoying that writers are not supposed to do multiple submissions. Publishers can take months and months with a manuscript while we're supposed to just wait around twiddling our fingers waiting for the proclamation from them. And all I'm getting is older.  My vampire book is coming along nicely. 220 pages so far and it's all gold, baby. When I'm finished that one I start on the series. Both of 'em. One for adults, and one for young adults. My ideas are simmering in my wittle brain right now. Coming to a slow boil of imaginative goodness.  If it wasn't for this day job... Well, I'd probably find another way to procrastinate.  Okay, I'll finish the first draft of vampire book by the end of the month. My Writer's Digest Short Story workshop starts on May 27th.   Like I've said before, thank Christ I don't have a social life. Hey, wait a minute...

      Okay, decided to write a bio so I can attach it to my query letters.  :::THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS:::   Duh.  ---  Michelle R. was born in Toronto, Ontario.  As a child she decided that when she grew up she was either going to become a flight attendant or a jewel thief. Neither option worked out. Instead she threw caution to the wind and took English Literature in university to hopefully lead to a career in writing, but chickened out, dropped out, and went for the ‘safe day job’ route and focused on Graphic Design.  After several unfulfilling years as a graphic designer, with dreams of writing the next bestselling novel, she finally did more than just think about it. She bought the most expensive laptop computer she could find, and then stared at it for many months before she began working on her first work of fiction…a young adult fantasy trilogy entitled The Soulshifters. The completed trilogy has since met with the most complimentary rejection letters from several top U.S. publishers.  Since then she has completed a chick lit/vampire novel of epic comedy proportions entitled Dearly Departed. Michelle is confident she will receive many complimentary rejection letters about this novel as well.  She is now in the midst of procrastinating on writing what she considers her ‘opus,’ an open-ended series about a female ‘demon bounty hunter,’ which will meet all her personal fiction requirements: humor, drama, suspense, fantasy, romance, and talking house pets. She is also considering writing a romantic suspense novel, however since reading romance novels in general makes her feel queasy, this may not pan out.  Michelle has her eyes firmly fixed on the future in which she will live the perfect full-time novelist’s life:  a beach house in Santa Barbara; a manservant named Sven; crafting page upon page of fun, exciting, best-selling fiction until the day she finally hitches a ride off this rock.  ---  Okay, on second thought I may leave out the stuff about "rejection letters." It might give them ideas. They may not have senses of humor. Or whatever.

      I think I'm going to revamp the website. I haven't updated it in forever because I just look at it and say...what's the point? I was going to let it go when the expiration comes up, but I've always liked the name.... strangemuse.com. So I'll hold onto it for another year. I think I'll make it writing-centric. All about the world of writing...links, quotes, inspiration, etc.  Perhaps, perhaps.  Also I've just figured out how to use the "Web" feature in QuarkXPress 6.0. Well, not totally, but I know regular Quark like the back of my hand, so this would be much easier than trying to wrap my tiny brain around dreamweaver again.  We shall see. Oh yes, we shall see.

      Scholastic Publishing, O vast and great one Why don't you want me? Why can't you see? I don't like rejections And I hoped you would make this easy for me.  Your letter came yesterday Only a few short refrains But at the end The message was the same  My book is fast-paced and suspenseful But your list is currently full I think I would have rathered If you'll called my writing dull   Okay, I suck at poetry, but I think I got the message across.  I am sad. But not surprised. I took it better than Dial's rejection.  I have no more to say.

      Yeah, and how did I think the song Black, Black Heart was going to snap me out of my funk? Well, it's a cool song.  I feel better today. There's nothing like watching the pilot of "Next Action Star" to make me realize that my life and dreams aren't so ridiculous. At least I don't have to enter a room while doing a flying kick. Or do I? Hmmmm.  I've decided to get the professional editing/manuscript evaluation done. I knew there was a reason I had this fucking day job. It's to pay for this expensive little writing hobby I've got. Ahh. It all makes sense now.  So, let's see... goals for the week...  1) Try not to stress out too much 2) Think positive 3) Don't sweat the small stuff (see #1) 4) Write short story for workshop...okay I feel stress. I've been procrastinating on that... 5) See #1 and #3 6) Watch a lot of television  Okay. I think I can handle #6. The others...not so much.

      When I'm down, the best way to get me back up is listening to my huge collection of MP3s. Here's one of my favorite songs of all time. It sets the tone to a lot of the stuff I want to write.  Black Black Heart Lyrics Artist: David Usher  Something ugly this way comes Through my fingers sliding inside All these blessings all these burns I'm godless underneath your cover Search for pleasure search for pain In this world now I am undying I unfurl my flag my nation helpless  Black black heart why would you offer more Why would you make it easier on me to satisfy I'm on fire I'm rotting to the core I'm eating all your kings and queens All your sex and your diamonds  As I begin to lose my grip On these realities your sending Taste your mind and taste your sex I'm naked underneath your cover Covers lie and we will bend and borrow With the coming sign The tide will take the sea will rise and time will rape  Black black heart why would you offer more Why would you make it easier on me to satisfy I'm on fire I'm rotting to the core I'm eating all your kings and queens All your sex and your diamonds  Black black heart why would you offer more Why would you make it easier on me to satisfy I'm on fire I'm rotting to the core I'm eating all your kings and queens All your sex and your diamonds All your sex and your diamonds All your sex and your diamonds All your sex and your diamonds All your sex and your diamonds

      I feel like I'm about five minutes away from a nervous breakdown. Everything is getting to me. There has to be a better way to live that the life I've fucked up for myself. I feel like I've painted myself into a corner.  Prepare the rubber room.

      Okay, I finished my read-though of DD at just before 1 a.m. last night (morning, whatever). There were still some icky parts in the last section, but no major suck chapters, so I'm cool with that.  Now I begin my revisions. Yippy?  How come first drafts are always so much more fun than second ones? Oh look at me...I sound like I've written twenty books. Well, the trilogy counts as three, the NaNo piece of shit counts as one and this makes for five in total. Okay, I'm not a pro, but my point is...revisions are work. Not necessarily fun work.  I'm considering getting a professional editor to look at the second draft. I want this to look as pretty as humanly possible since I'll be using this particular novel as my "calling card" to get a decent agent and/or publisher.  But then I start to worry... what if I'm fooling myself? What if I'm the William Hung of novel writing? What if I'm, "publish my novel!" and all I get is... laughter or pity, or even worse, no reaction at all? What if I've been fooling myself all these years holding my dream of being a writer up in front of me like a precious jem, shiny and beautiful, when really the jem is only paste? I mean, look at my bloody jem metaphor! That's shitty writing!  Arghh.  ::::Self doubt creeps in and pokes me in the eye::::   I guess the only thing to do is to make sure I'm writing things that I, myself, enjoy. That way, if it does end up getting published, then that'll only be the sweet icing on the cake.  Oh God, another crappy metaphor. And now I'm hungry. Mmmm. Cake.  Okay, now back to my fun-filled, soul-sucking day job.

      So there I was, plugging along at the read-through on my manuscript, fooling myself into believing, that "hey, this doesn't suck," when it happened.  I hit the suck chapter.  Chapter 25. I guess I should be lucky I was relatively suck-less until then.  Suck, suck, suck.  This is a very important chapter. It introduces a new character, a potential aide to the villains; adds information that is imperitive to getting to the end of the book; strains the relationship between heroine and hero #2.  And it sucks. Bad.  I think it's because I lost Sarah's voice. She's basically just standing around watching (boring) stuff happen and feeling sorry for herself. The location is dull, and the new character is mind-numbingly boring. I'm just pushing the characters around like chess pieces, and I don't think they like it at all.  So, instead of marking it up carefully with my red pen and taking notes, I just wrote a big red "REWRITE" on all of Chapter 25's pages.  Then I went to bed and read some of Laurell K. Hamilton's 'Narcissus in Chains.' Talk about suck. That book sucks in bad ways *and* good ways. She's the master. I want to suck at writing just as good as she does.

      Instead of watching game seven of the Stanley Cup last night (which I frankly didn't give a rat's ass about), I cleared all of the crap off my desk -- magazines, dirty clothes, more magazines, and varous other unmentionable items -- and went about the task of revising DD. My first round involves reading it, keeping numbered notes relating to areas I need to rewrite or simply question, ie: were rats blamed for spreading the Black Death plague? How do you spell Dolce & Gabanna? Stuff like that. I sub in better words, keeping an eye open for my "danger words" like: "really", "very", "turned", "looked", etc. The words I use as crutches. I try to elimate as many -ly words as possible, but some of 'em just fit, so I leave them in for now.   So I did about 100 pages last night in around 5 hours. A bunch more on Sunday. I think I can finish up with my read-through tonight. Then the hard stuff begins. Typing it all in, and filling my gaping holes. I wouldn't mind plumping it up by about ten thousand words if possible. If not possible, then it doesn't really matter since I'm already at 86,000.  I want to finish the revisions in the next two weeks. Then off it goes to my should-be-an-editor-but-isn't friend who will give it a beta reading for the price of a pizza and diet coke and the promise to thank her profusely in my future published novels. Then I'm on to working on the series. Serieses. Two series. Although that sounds like a lot of work. Maybe I'll get back to my 50 abandonned pages of adventure-suspense-romance that have been languishing on my hard drive for the last year.  One thing at a time. And right now...it's time for lunch.

      I'm going out to shop for a new television. Oh the fun. I'm going to hit The Brick and Best Buy. The majority of the weekend will be for revising the novel. I found that I wasn't able to bare the sight of it for about a week so I let it sit in its lovely little blue and white binder in the corner of my room. But I'm definitely attacking it with full force today and tomorrow.  I'm still waiting for the instructor's impressions of my short story ideas for the workshop. I feel as though they don't suck, but what the hell do I know? A part of me is regretting taking the course... that's $349 bucks I really don't have, and I really should be using the time to work on revisions. But...I'm in it, and I'm going to make the best of it. Ideas have been coming at me from every direction for short stories, all I can do is write them down and pray for the best. If I prayed, that is. Maybe I should start.  Dear Deity-that-will-listen-to-little-ol-me: Please let Scholastic buy my trilogy. Pretty please, with sacrificed virgins on top.  There, that should do it. The phone should start ringing any second now.  I'm waiting.  Mmm kay. Fine. Be that way.

      Finished the first draft of the vampire book. Very happy with it.  The last line is great, if I do say so myself, and I may as well say so myself since who else is going to?  I'm going to do Holly Lisle's  urlLink One Pass Revision  and get that little bugger out the door by the end of June. Hoo-yah! I have three, count 'em THREE, agents I want to start stalking....er...I mean *querying*.  First assignment for the Short Story Workshop is due tomorrow. I have two ideas I'm interested in. Should be fun. Yet another distraction.   Canadian Idol begins tonight. I promised myself that I wouldn't watch it this year, since I loathe Ben Mulroney with a passion. And the judges suck. And the talent isn't that great...wait a minute...then why am I planning on watching it and actually looking forward to it? Two little words, my friends.  No. Life.  It's raining like a son of a bitch outside right now. Lately I've been saying to whomever complains about the weather: "At least it's not snow!" I've said that annoying phrase so many times lately that I want to kick my own ass.

      I think a sign of getting old is not being able to ride rollercoasters anymore. I went to Canada's Wonderland on my day off on Monday and went on several rides. I didn't get sick from them, but, alas, the joy is gone. Now breaching the summit of a coaster, looking down at the plunge to come, I no longer consider fun. Now it's just slightly torturous. And to top it off with a minimum half hour wait per ride, I'm ceasing to see the point. But the day was still fun.  I've writtten 9,000 words on my Flipside so far and it seems to be going along smoothly enough. Just want to get the bones down during the first draft, then I'll add skin and muscles later. Oh yeah, and the big yuk-yuks. It's got to be funny. Well, Flipside funny, anyhow.  I'm listening to the audio version of Stephen King's "On Writing" at the moment. Well, not this exact moment, but still. He says he works best without an outline. Just lets the characters take him on a ride, and at the end of it he ends up with a book. Well, sorry Stevie, but your last few books haven't been stellar IMHO, so I think for the time being I'll stick with my plot outline. You're still the man, though. (even though I'll never forgive you for Insomnia, one of the most pointless books I've ever finished reading).  Heavy sigh.  Okay, I guess I'll go get some mindless work done.  La la la.

      "Dark Haven" (revised title thus) sucks big time. It's not going well. I know it has potential, but that potential I may not be able to reach. My character seems to be trying too hard to be a hard ass. She's a pale Anita Blake wannabe with less personality. Sigh. I shall let it sit and simmer and fester for a while as I peruse a new project.  My writing email buddy and I were discussing how to be successful in today's writing world (successful = writing exclusively and making enough money that you don't have to do stuff you don't like for a paycheque), and we decided, sadly enough, that category romance is probably the easiest and most lucrative area of the publishing industry for the regular joe off the street to break into. I thought about this, as I have in the past, but this time I came at it from a different angle. Whenever I've tried to write a category romance, I've tried to remake the wheel. Make it palatable to me, a non-category reader. Give the heroine more problems, a edgier personality, etc. At least I'd like to think I tried to do those things.  Driving home yesterday I just let my mind wander. What would be the most vapid, the most sugar-sweet, diabetic-coma-inducing plot I could think of? And :::bling::: it came to me...characters, plot, conflict, in all it's chocolate-chip gooey glory. And I'm going to write it. In one month. I'm going to Nano it and see what comes out of the oven. All the metaphors about baking are on purpose, because the sweetest thing I could think of is something revolving around pastries. My heroine owns a small bakery. My tentative title is "Sugar & Spice" and I will aim it at Harlequin's insipid Flipside line. This means I'm actually going to have to get serious about it and choke down a couple current books they have. Can do. The one I started reading last night is kind of lame. Comedy is way subjective, that's for sure. They all seem to read like a mediocre episode of "Suddenly Susan." I'll try to make mine like a *good* episode of "Suddenly Susan." (There were good episodes of that show?)  Anyhow, one month....August 22, 2004. If I don't have anything worth using by then, so be it.

      I hate Mondays. I'm trying to be more positive, really I am. But they just suck. Today was a particularly stressful day at work. I'm very glad there's only another half an hour left. I'm leaving right on the dot.  What to say, what to say...  I've completed the first 25 pages of the now retitled "Dark Haven." It feels awkward, I'm not completely in love with my main character. I don't know. I know if I stick with it, it'll all come together. Or at least that's the hope. I have to remember to write for myself. I can't concern myself with whether or not this will get published one day. That's not going to do me any good in the next three months or so of slogging away.  Only three and a half more months till Nanowrimo 2004. Now that's fun writing. Unfortunately at the end you're usually left with two hundred pages of shit. At least I was. But it's fun shit.  I sold some Buffy stuff on eBay over the weekend. I got some decent money for it, and I didn't feel as though I was selling my dog. In other words, it didn't hurt to get rid of it all. Funny though, when I'm a buyer, I relish sniping. When i'm a seller, I'm looking at my auctions and screaming "Bid, you bastards! Bid!" I've been a member of the eBay community for five whole years. Back when I used to think that Beanies were the be all and the end all. Now I wish I had back all the money I spent on those little button eyed freaks. C'est la vie.

I saw him in a preview for a movie called "dear Freddie" and my jaw dropped. He was also in the second Tomb Raider. I'll have to rent that. Or buy it. He's going to be the Phantom in the movie version of the Phantom of the Opera and ironically enough I used to have a huge crush on that character. I've always liked psychos.

      The builder has finally broken ground on my condo. I should be all moved in and paying my mortgage like a good grown-up person roughly a year from now. I guess I'd better start actually paying attention to that "Budget To End All Budgets" I developed a couple of months ago. But, that Kermit the Frog figure I bought on eBay last week was a necessary expense! Really! (sadly, I am not joking about that particular purchase). Okay. Budget. Me on one. Now.

      July 15 (that's today!) marks the day I'm going to start writing the first book in my dark urban fantasy series. I've done just about all the notes I think I need. I've picked my actors. :-) (little pictures I put with the character profiles); I have my plot points; I know my conflict...  I'm ready.  So... I'm going for 100,000 words, 400 pages. First person. The title "Dark Nexus" will change, but I like a title to start with. It sounds a little too hard fantasy/sci fi to me, but it'll do for now.  And I want to be finished it by October 15. Three months. Two months for first draft, so what's that... 60 days... 1667 words a day (hey, just like Nano). Okay, maybe that's a little too much. I don't want to get frustrated with it. Also I want to edit as I go so it's not so much at the end. Okay fine. I'll take the three months to do the first draft: 1111 words a day: roughly five pages. I can do that. My goal is to have the first three books finished quickly (in about a year) so I can market them as a "ready-made" series.   I envision the series to be "Laurell K. Hamilton" meets "Buffy" meets "Nikita" meets "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" meets "Charmed." Various actors I've picked to play the characters in the movie theatre that is my head include: Angelina Jolie, Adrian Brody, Drew Barrymore, Jude Law, Keith Szarabajka (Holtz on Angel), and Danny DeVito. There's also a cat, but I haven't cast him yet.  =^..^=  All right then. Let's do it. Well, after this damn day job thing.

      When things seem bleak, subscribe to a new cable network. I'm now subscribing to the Game Show Network. I can hang out with Pat and Vanna circa 1988. Alex Trebek (sp?) when he still had a moustache.  Yes, life is good.  Today, since I can't seem to deal with anything major, like starting the writing on my new book in progress (BiP), I'm going to watch some Angel Season 3 on DVD and clear out my bookcase. I have a huge box of books I want to unload at a second hand bookstore. I am now going to go to the library more instead of just buying books I"ll never read. Part of my new 'holy shit I'm moving into my condo next year' budget.  Speaking of budgets, I'm going to research some sort of personal accounting software now.  Fun.

      I want to move to England. Specifically London. I think I've always wanted to.  But, like everything else in my ridiculous life I need to wait.  All I do is wait.  Wait to lose weight. Wait to pay off my Visa. Wait to sell a novel. Wait till I save money. Wait till I find a better job. Wait till I find a boyfriend to stand the sight of me. Wait till next month. Wait till next year. Wait till hell freezes over. Wait till I'm too old to care anymore. Wait till I'm dead.  So I bought the condo which has *just* started construction. I have to wait another year to move in, and at the same time, I'm *waiting* to pay the mortgage every month that will essentially keep me tied to a job I hate.  I don't know how to break out of this holding pattern I've put myself into. I'm not a plane. I'm a person. A person who, despite the fact I view myself as old, am only 33. I have a lot of life ahead of me (fortunately or unfortunately). I guess when I was in my twenties, the world seemed wide open to fufilling my dreams, also wide open to procrastinating, because after all, as soon as I put my mind to things, then I'd achieve them easily. Right? At least that's the way things used to go. Everything used to come easily to me. Now I feel like I've dug myself into a deep hole, and I'm looking up at a small piece of sky, but I don't have the energy to crawl out. It's just easier to keep digging.  Dunno.

      Normally I'd write a quick one liner because it amuses me, but I have to say...this movie rocked. I loved it, loved it, loved it.  Right now I'm reading a book called "Writing the Breakout Novel" by Donald Maass. He's a well-known literary agent who knows what the hell he's talking about and this movie is a great example of all the important "requirements" for a "break-out" piece of entertainment.  Characters:  A sympathetic protagonist: Peter Parker. This guy has it so bad that I was really pulling for him. Everything was going wrong for him, and then when you think things might pick up a bit, they only get worse. I wanted to give the poor shmoe a hug. As well as a whole cast of interesting, three-dimensional people who have their own agendas, thoughts, dreams, plans.  Stakes:  High stakes, both internal (his relationship with his best bud and Mary-Jane, the woman he loves but can't tell her) and external: Doc Ock putting the city of New York in danger.  Plot:  Multi-layered. Not just 'see the superhero beat the bad guy.' This movie had so much going on I couldn't take a bathroom break...and that wasn't a good thing! No more large diet-cokes for me!  Theme:  The most integral part, I think, in separating this movie from, say, Van Helsing (which sucked, pun intended). As with the first movie, the theme is "with great power comes great responsibility." Every scene resonated with this, and what it meant for Peter and his 'burden' of being a misunderstood good guy. Being a hero ain't always a piece of cake. Sometimes people aren't going to be waving flags and patting you on the back. Sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do because it's the right thing, whether or not you get any personal results from it.  Anyhow, this was a great movie. The preview for Catwoman was at the beginning. Ten years ago this would have been a great thing as far as I was concerned. Now, it just fills me with a sense of dread. I know it will be bad. I just know it. Which is too bad. I mean, come on. Just look at that costume. It's disgusting. I, as a female who doesn't like chick flicks -- who would rather see an action pic anyday -- am insulted that in this day and age we can't have a female hero on the big screen without flashing a shitload of cleavage. And the shoes? Yeah, let's fight crime wearing high-heeled pumps. Puh-lease. But who knows? I'd love to be proven wrong. Come on, Halle, show me a great, female, superhero movie. I double dog dare you.  Spiderman 2: Michelle's rating: 10/10

      Perhaps it's a good thing that the kibosh has been put on my Flipside. It doesn't really fit in with my "genre preferée" anyhow. That's french for preferred genre. I think.  I played around with a few ideas: make it sexier, make it longer and chick lit, but nahhhh. Screw it.  I'm going to write a few short stories while I wait for the editor gal to get back to me with her ideas on Dearly Departed. Sometime hopefully this month. Argh.  After DD's all squeaky clean and shiny, off it goes. Then I start my newly revised series idea.  I've also recently re-embraced my personal training sessions I had left at the gym. I've been in mourning for my old trainer who quit six months ago...or at least I was using that as an excuse to be completely lazy and eat whatever I wanted. I have 19 sessions left, at two a week, that's um...nine weeks. I'm also going to do Atkins. Why not? Bloody everyone else is. They even have low carb bread. Boggles the mind.  My two goals in life: become a (published) novelist and get in shape. This is the year(ish).

      So I went to wade into the discussions at eharlequin.com, find out what I need to send in for my query...and I find out that they're discontinuing their Flipside line! This sucks. Where else can I send a 60,000 word comedy romance? Should I even keep working on it? The suckiest thing is I kinda like it now. I want to find out what happens.  Dammit.  Okay, I'll keep plugging along. It's not like anyone was going to buy it anyhow. I'll consider it a warm up for the next book. And if it turns out okay, I'll add more sex in and call it a Temptation.

The only ones I've ever written have been the nasty smut in my Buffy Fan Fic. Wait, did I just admit that out loud? Grrr. Anyhow, decidedly not category love scenes. No four letter words for body parts allowed.   Okay, I'll shut up now.
