						    Hello again. It's really late. I guess it's actually early. I find that three&nbsp;a.m. is my "bedtime" of late. I always seem to fall asleep then. There just is not enough time in one day for some much needed sleep. Tomorrow is my last day of work for the week. I am pleased about that. Seriously, I love weekends. The new TBS cd is growing on me. I didn't like it at first but now I do. AP liked it as well, but that was a given.     &nbsp;   I am excited about my band with Dan. We have decided for sure now to have a demo out by the end of the summer, definitely in time for the battle. The demo will include three original songs and three covers. That's the plan at this moment in time anyway. We have decided on the covers but still need to do up some original pieces. Expect some good vocals on the demo. Me and Dan also have another offer from a self-described "screamo" band made up of Jeff Althouse, Stefan Hoffman, and Steve Hebard. Depending upon how much time is needed for our demo and other business we&nbsp;may begin practice with them sometime in August.     &nbsp;   I'm getting some positive feedback about the show in October. I really want to make it happen so if anyone has any ideas or wants to help, AIM me. As of now it will be the clubhouse, but if anyone has&nbsp;another venue in mind,&nbsp;let me know.     &nbsp;   "The Village" comes out tomorrow night. This one looks good. I think you should all see it.     Also, I am looking at purchasing a half stack for the bass. Let me know if you can help.   Love and Later.

						    Today had a very crappy feeling to it. It rained the entire day and&nbsp;I slept in until one. The day felt like a waste day. Oh well. I didn't have to work because of it so that was a major plus. I went out most of the afternoon with my mom and sister. We had about a million stops and the rain made that suck. I got the new TBS cd though. Like&nbsp;I said before, it's okay. Then I went to Kelley's house. We went to Mike's and then back to her house until about three when I left. It was fun, one of those times where it felt like you did a lot but when you think about it you basically did nothing. Very fun though.&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I'm thinking a lot about my hair of late. I wanna get it cut short. Actually short on the sides but leave it long on top and with longer bangs. I just don't want to give up the long stuff. It's unique. I need to decide by the end of the day tomorrow though. If I wait any longer than that and its sucks, it won't have any recovery time before school. Growing my hair out is horrible so I better like it.&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I'm trying to set up a "Battle of the Bands" for October. Actually not really a battle, more like a show. I'm planning on renting out the clubhouse. It is a big concrete floored room so it should be fine for the show. It costs about $100 to rent so I'm thinking of charging $2 or something to make it back. I've talked to Mike about it and he is up for helping run it and getting bands. For now, I'm saying Saturday, October 23. This date is still up in the air so I'll let you know for sure at a later date. If anyone is interested in playing then, let me know on AIM.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Okay well it's raining, it's pouring, and this kid is snoring. Later.

						    Hello. I've been meaning to do something like this again since my livejournal thing but never did. I even thought about doing it on paper. However, my good friend   urlLink  Dan    has convinced me to do it here. Even though he did it because of Hey Mercedes, I will do it because of him.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Anyway, to update, it's the middle of the summer still. August will be a busy month. Warped Tour twice with many cool people. Then I have a trip to Maine which will be fun because Kelley is going. Then I&nbsp;have a trip to New Jersey as well before it's back to school. I am halfway there now in HS. This year will be sad because so many kids graduated last year that were very fun. They will be missed. At least there are some really great seniors to take there place this year. Things look absolutely dismal for my senior year though, with&nbsp;basically everyone&nbsp;who is valued gone,&nbsp;but that is still a long way off.&nbsp;Plus there will still be some real cool kids that will be there. You know who you are.&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I hate working. With a passion. I do it everyday and it is all because&nbsp;I have to pay a lot of money to drive come September when&nbsp;I get my&nbsp;&nbsp;JR License. That will be good because I can go&nbsp;where&nbsp;I want&nbsp;and when (between 6 am and 11pm). It is about time I must say. I owe so many people rides now because of all the rides I bummed off of them this past year. You know who you are so seriously, live in my car because you have every right.&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   As of now I am in one band, an acoustic monster of a band, destined for greatness. Dan does the guitar justice all of the time and he is truly amazing. I play bass with him and am totally undeserving of his talent but, hey,&nbsp;I love playing music with him so I will continue. I have been in a few other band before, none of which were acoustic. Sometimes I miss these bands&nbsp;just because they didn't work but I am always open for bass playing. For now Dan & I are on our way to sold out arena shows so you'll have to wait, like everyone else, for the tickets. We did a show at Sarah Street Grill on June 30. What a night. Cool kids and fun. I have pictures, just not now so you'll have to wait to see those as well.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I have been&nbsp;listening to Armor for Sleep lately and&nbsp;I am enjoying it. Also Modest Mouse and Small Towns. New TBS&nbsp;out tomorrow. I have already heard most of it. It should be okay.     &nbsp;   Well, I am out of things to say and I'm tired so goodbye.

						    Hello. Work starts again tomorrow. I could not be looking forward to this any less. I seriously hate working. If I can't get Friday off, then no Mae show. I really want to go seeing as I have a ride and it is at Croc Rock. I am working out the final strings tomorrow so wish me luck. Only ten days of work until next summer. Thirty-one until my license. I still need to do more work on parallel parking. I will be good, no doubt.      Dan and I are looking to start an electric band, drums and distortion, the whole nine yards. If you drum, play guitar, and are influenced by Matchbook Romance, Taking Back Sunday, and Mae, AIM me ASAP. Thank you.      Me and Kelley watched "Sling Blade" tonight. I liked it, same goes for Kell. I have wasted time on some bad movies lately and was glad to see this one. Mike and Ash are still in Delaware. Mike called me today and I never asked when they get back so I guess it will be a surprise.      Well, once again my blog will be short and pointless. There is just not enough to write about anymore. Haircut next week. This is all. Love &amp; Later.

						    Hello. It rained again today. I am so sick of it. I am finally updating again. These past few days have been so boring. Nothing happened which was worth the time to write about. I worked on Wednesday. I am off from Thursday through Sunday. Yesterday I basically did nothing and then hung out with Kelley. That was fun, but still. Summer is wasting away. Not cool.      Today was Liz Lynch's party and I am angry that I forgot it. Now it is going on and I am stuck here with no ride and no gift. Not cool.      I posted more pictures from the first Warped Tour on the old post. The second set of Warped pictures will not be up until Sunday because Wal-Mart workers are lazy so I decided not to pay for one-hour photo. If they turn out as I hope them to, they will be worth the wait.      Well, I am done for now. Love &amp; Later.

						    Hello again. Today I went to the second of my Warped shows and, if it is possible, today was better than Sunday's. We ot there about 12:30 or so and went straight to the main stage, which at Hershey is one huge stage split by two bands. We got right upfront on the Teal Stage side, the left side, of the main stage. We were on the wood connected to the rail, so maybe two people back from the front. On our side of the main stage, the first band up was Matchbook Romance. Pure awesome. It was one of their only days on the main stage so they rocked it like crazy. Next, on the other side, was Sugarcult. They were okay. They played slower than on their cd's, but still okay. Then back on our side was NFG. They were, surprisingly, very good. The crowd was ridiculously rough for them, but they were cool to see live. Then on the other side was Coheed and Cambria. There are no words to describe how musically talented they are live. Simply amazing. Then back on our side we saw Taking Back Sunday. They have such energy when they play it is so so cool. They played the same set as on Sunday, some new and old classics, plus Great Romances. It was so cool to see them so close at Warped because the crowds for them are ridiculously large. Then we left the main stage and walked a bit.       We met up with the Matchbook Romance drummer and bassist at their merch tent. We talked with them and got them to sign stuff. Cool guys, especially the bassist. Then we met The Matches and again got stuff signed. We kept running into the frontman of Fall Out Boy. He just walked around all day and hardly anybody knew who he was. It was great and he was a cool guy. At 7:15 we watched them on the Maurice Stage. Talk about energy. They were stoked as it was their first Warped date ever. They did about seven songs I think. The last two songs saw Matchbook's drummer and bassist guest appear. Talk about a heavenly set. We were about ten people back and mostly centered for them. Pretty good spot. They were awesome.      I have pictures of this show as well, all of main stage bands. However, I am still in need of one hour photo. As soon as they are developed, I will post them.      I would like to thank Dan for coming with us today because his company and sarcasm added to the great time. Here is his version of  urlLink events  because I think he covered it better than me. Seriosluy, Dan is one cool kid who should be on the top of everyone's list of "Who to Take to a Concert" or just anywhere. Thanks again Dan.      Now, I'm exhausted and in need of sleep. Love &amp; Later.

						    Hello. Went to the Vans Warped Tour today at Englishtown Raceway in Jersey. Awesome show and day, seriously. Met the MCS drummer and moogist and I bought a track jack from them and Kell got a t-shirt from them. Then, basically watched Matchbook Romance and Motion City Soundtrack. MBR's guitarist was crazy sick so they did an acoustic set which was pretty awesome. They played a new one off of their upcoming split with MCS. Cool song. Following them on the same stage, The Maurice Stage, was MCS. They rocked that stage like no other. They played about seven songs or so, a good mix of their stuff. Later on we met the whole of MCS. They signed stuff for me and Kell. Really really cool guys. They liked Kell's home-made shirt. We tried to get over to see TBS but there was a larger crowd there than I have seen for any other band ever at Warped. So we climbed onto the bleachers and watched from there. They played their classics and a few from the new cd. All-in-all, great day. We go again on Tuesday to the show in Hershey. Needless to say, can't wait.      Took some shots at the show but only have enough room to upload three from the other site so here they are:             Motion City Soundtrack        Matchbook Romance      Sorry for the poor picture quality. I had to shrink them a bit. AIM me and I can send you full size pictures.      Again, it was a great show and a great day. We got a ton of free stuff and it was very fun. Only bad things: traffic and $3 drinks.      Im completely beat and am going to bed. Can't wait until Tuesday. Love &amp; Later.

						    Hello. Today was a much better day. Dan and me finally practiced today. We have not been able to practice for a while because there was no time when we could both practice. We worked on one of Dan's songs. I added bass to it last time we practiced but it was so long ago that I had trouble remembering it. I recalled some of it, enough to get the general idea. I showed Dan stuff I had worked on so he could add guitar to it. The only problem was that most of mine was unfinished. I am too sporadic. Oh well, Dan is so so good and he will be able to add guitar. We should definitely have an ep in time for the battle. The Swingset Kids are moving.      Last night I went out with Kell, Mike, and Ashley. We went to Pizza Hut, Blockbuster, and Ash's. We watched the movie "Monster". It was okay, kind of freaky. It was a fun time though.      I tried to parallel park today. I swear I will never do it again once I pass my test. Seriously. I was at the Resica parking lot for about an hour. I can do it sometimes but I will need to do more trips like this if I want to pass my test.      Sunday is the first of our Warped dates. I am excited for this one the most because I will finally get to see MCS. They are still on one of the smaller stages so that makes it even better. They will rock that stage, no doubt. Speaking of the gods, their split with Matchbook Romance is out in September and in Ocotber they record their new cd. Mark Hoppus is going to produce it. Needless to say, I can't wait.      Again, I'm tired and it's past three. Love &amp; Later.

						    Hey again. Today was a very bad day. I don't even know where to begin. I thought it was going to rain, meaning no work. Too bad it was sunny. So I overslept and was late for work. Then I got my paycheck and found that they haven't paid me for hours that I worked when it rained. I have to go back and fix everything to get the money. Not cool. So work basically cancelled band practice, or at least delayed it. I get home late and called Dan and got his voicemail. Another not cool. Then I go to town for a while and I get a call from Mike. He and Rachel have no ride to Warped Tour now and I feel bad about that, so I try and find them one, but no luck. Again, not cool. Then I get home and finally talk to Dan, but, like I guessed, it's too late to practice. So in all, very uncool day and the general theme being: LATE.      To update on the movie thing, yesterday Mike and Rachel asked Kell & me to help them make a scary-ish movie as well. I guess they were planning on making a movie too. So we joined forces and the movie idea is starting to get bigger. Again, thanks to everyone who is down for helping. AIM me if you want in too.       Tomorrow will be a busy day. Im going to learn to parallel park because I guess I need to to pass my road test, which I need to schedule also. I need to go take money back from my job too. Then I will practice with Dan around fourish. Then Kell and me are headed to town to buy clothes for Allison's Late Night Garden Party on Saturday (formal wear only).   There will be a bunch of fun kids there and it should be very fun.       Well, it is now three again. I wanted to get to bed by two tonight. Oh well, to insomniac hell with me. Love &amp; Later.

						    Hey there. I would like to start off by saying that Dan is the most sarcastic kid ever and his sarcasm is the funniest thing since the knock-knock joke. Seriously, you will cry. Anyway finally got most of the Warped Tour situation cleared up. That's good considering the shows are three days and five days away. Now we just have to go to the things, which is never the hard part.      I worked on some logos for Allison Plays Hopscotch today. I had no ideas for Swingset Kids logos so I did APH ones instead. They are okay, still pretty sketchy. Oh well, no rush on them, just fun to do. Check em:     and      Those are two of the six logos I messed around with. Let me know what you think.      I thought I had more to write. Oh well, I'm tired so I will sleep. Love &amp; Later.

						    Hello again. The past two days have been cool and crazy. Yesterday was fun. I rented the movie, The Elephant. It was okay. Bad story, I thought. Underdeveloped and not good characters, however there were some great shots. Most were drawn out though. Anyway, the movie is basically a normal HS day and then there is a school shooting. Me and Kell gave it a "eh". The 2003 Cannes loved it though. Oh well, I guess we differ in tastes.      I talked with Dan yesterday too. Possibly a show on Friday, Smithfield Park or Spring Lake. Very "iffy". My old band is playing. I found it funny that they are now referred to as "Doug's Band". Oh well, I don't think it will make a difference. Today I found out it might be at Lewis' and there will be ice cream involved. Who cares, let's just play. Me and Dan will probably practice and work on new songs sometime this week.     I talked with Tommy of Small Towns last night. Cool guy and an awesome band. They played in Jersey on Sunday, same place Dan played acoustic in July, and I couldn't go. This kind of made up for it. We talked for about an hour or so. Again, a cool guy.    So out of the following, which band name? The Swingset Kids or Allison Plays Hopscotch. AIM me or comment and let me know. We are currently undecided.      Thanks to those who responded about the movie. You will all be in it.      Well it's after three again and I have work. I need to start sleeping more. Love &amp; Later.

						    The end of my weekend has come and it's back to work tomorrow. Not cool. Neither was "The Village". One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Not what you expect/want. Not worth $8. Not good. Anyway, after the movie was fun. Perkins with kids and then home. Saturday was a party. Actually a block party and then cake and sleeping at Kelley's. Sunday was homes, pictures, and thunderstorms. I can't find this cd Kelley burned for me and it's bothering me.   I'll look again tomorrow.      So I received some word on our HS Battle of the Bands and realized that if what I heard is true, it may be bad. I heard that they are holding it in the courtyard and that we have a 20 minute set. 20 minutes is okay, but the courtyard is garbage. I think that they are wrong but if they are not, that won't be cool. All the more reason to put on a show thing in October if you catch my drift.      I want to make a movie. A short one with a point and a scare to it.  I will need people so if you want to volunteer, AIM me and let me know.     Dan is working on a computer game for our band. It will be mind blowing. Seriously, you will have to play it to know it. We'll let you know when it is done.      Today Small Towns played in NJ, the same venue that Dan played at in July. I wanted to go so bad but had no ride and had no money. That rocked like no other I'm sure. Oh well, next time.      I'm tired. Love &amp; Later
