      im kind of new to this blogging thing so what im gonna probabally do is explain what i do on a day o day basis. before i go on i do gotta tell you that i am in high school and may not spell things correctley or use proper english and sometimes thethings i may tell you about may sound kind of childish but the people i hang out with are open like this.  to start ou i wanna tell u  about this girl i like, im not gonna tell u her name but lets call her ms.n, about all year i have been seeing her in the hall but couldnt like ask her out or anything cuz i was with someone, so when i finally broke up with her i was like, hey now i can talk to her, so u know i started by saying wazzup or how are u doing. im kind of a shy guy and dont really talk to that many girls, not that im gay or n e thing, but im shy, so i told a couple of my friends and they like the loosers they are went and told her before i could, not that i was in a rush to tell her and all but they were like she was like she was flattered and all but that was it.  so my friend was like go up to her and talk to her so i was like ok i got it all planned out im a go up to her and be like "wazzup u know i like u and all cuz i know all these people been tellin you and i wanted to know if i could get your numer and mabey i could call u some times" so i had practiced it in front of the mirror and had it down pat and ready to do it.  so i went up to her and did it and do u beleive that she said no , well not so brief and short and blunt, but she was like, i dont really give my number out to that many people, so i was like thats cool so i left it at that.
