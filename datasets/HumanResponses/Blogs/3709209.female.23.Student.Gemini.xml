       i love the loose reality of dreams. i once had a dream i bought a baby at Loblaws for like six bucks. that's right, a baby. a loblaws baby. for six bucks. bought much like those poor pet shop puppies from behind dirrty salivaed glass. i always feel sorry for those puppies, which may have been why i purchased the baby. anyway, in the dream, once i get it home, and my roommate is all oooing and awing over it, i'm like "WTF am i going to do with a baby?!?!" the next day, I go out and purchase a little orange tabby cat. again with the ooing the awing, and the baby is now literally just 'yesterday's news'.  then, my mom and KristEYE are over and I am showing them "the new little addition to our household" -- the cat!! and my mom is all like "yeah, but where is the baby?" and i'm all, "oh, yeah, the baby" and proceed to search for it in my natural disaster of a room and find it under like a pile of dirrty socks. (aside: yes, it is a real baby, a unnaturally tiny one at that, but it never has a name. it is literally just 'the baby') i realize that i think i've only fed the baby once since I got it, which is why it is so small. then, i try to talk KristEYE into taking the baby off my hands, y'know for her new family 'n all (?!?!?!) and because it would really be unethical (?!?!!?) to *return* the baby, which is what KristEYE suggests I do. The remainder of the dream is a blur of me cuddling, caressing and bragging about the tabby kitty, and trying to pawn off the baby onto different people I know.   i figure either 1--this is a clear sign i'm not meant to have children, and/or 2--a foretelling of my getting a tabby pussy when i don't even particularly like kitties; my friend has a bundle and they need homes. i welcome any further interpretations.

       Helllllooo ladies... Please be gentle with little TraceyKathy.  She's not up with all the lingo and is a little worried about fitting in.  Please leave further instructions on the how-to to your tongue-twisting, mind-altering convos, and as to what you would like me to dish about.  Peace out.

       so we started this thing for "discussion" (snickering and bickering mostly), and you are welcome to join in if you'd like....there are just a few 'inspired' rules...  1st rule: You do not talk about HUSHCHILD.  2nd rule: You DO NOT talk about HUSHCHILD. (K, this is a bit extreme, soooo we've taken a random poll and decided that you can talk about hushchild)  3rd rule: If someone says "stop" or goes limp, taps out, HUSHCHILD is over.  4th rule: Minimum two guys to a fight.  5th rule: One HUSHCHILD at a time.  6th rule: No shirts, no shoes.  7th rule: HUSHCHILD will go on as long as they have to.  8th rule: If this is your first night at HUSHCHILD, you HAVE to post.  So, choose a pseudonym, put up your dukes, and come out full mouthed...

       that's what my mom would always say.  i could do anything!!  i could conquer the world!!  hey, i was 19 after all.  i applied for a job at the ottawa citizen.  low and behold, i got a call.  i went in for the meet and greet and was kinda struck (put not completely thrown off) by the fact that my "competition" was three g-pa lookalikes.  odd, but whatev i thought.  i never bothered to ask what the position was.  i didn't care, i needed a F'in job.  suddenly we're all in the warehouse.  odd, but whatev i thought.  before i know it, i'm being grilled about whether or not i can operate a forklift.  "ummm yeah, of course" was my reply.  hey, my mama always said i could do A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G, so i trusted that she was right.  one small catch, i'd be workin' the graveyard shift forkliftin' all of those daaaaaaaaamn OC papers.  not exactly my dream job.  sadly, i turned the job down.  who knows, i coulda woulda shoulda been o-town's first female forklifter.  now that's an accomplishment.

       Hey mama,   ...this that shit, that make you groove mama...  All ready for some super size this tonight?  okay, so how creepy was our phone call last night? that was R, and I, high on mint oreo blizzards and pecan parfaits, and in anticipation of the coco loco evening ahead of us. needless to say, yesterday was about as much fun I've had fixing my computer in a long time.   It's all smooth sailing from herrre though. Zether II is such a sweet machine - I think I might be in love. def potential marriage material. off the richta!  Although, it took all night. R went home around 8, but then was helping over the phone until 10. My fav convers between reboots:  R: Done loading already!! I still can't get over how lightning speed awesome your machine is. Amazing, it's (bachelor jessie) unbelievable. J:  Yeah, well the high speed internet helps. I don't know how life existed before... R: I don't get high speed out here. (R recently moved to rockland or something for a family-sized home for his wife and 1+1/2 yr old). J: (knowning R likes the comp world/internet/gaming probably just as much as life itself) Wha? Are you serious? Did you know that before you moved out there?! R: yeah J: (shocked) i'm in shock!! Dude, THAT's a tough decision: raising a family or high speed internet. I can't say that I would have come to the same conclusion... R: yeah, well... J: (epiphanied) actually, I guess I've made that decision, and the family-raising lost.   Huh, computers can teach you a lil something abo0t yourself after all.  la, la, la, la, la  Just jamma.  p.s. REEEEWIIIIINNDDDD....Cutie, cutie make sure you move your booty...

       possibly the best story i've heard in a long time, and definitely KristEYE amusing...  So, Harry Potter from work went to the Beerfest on Saturday, only to join countless others for expensive half pints and endless portapotty lines. (He's not from O-town.) When Potter was second in line (after a good thirty minute wait) for the next available green box of a toilet, a mad (picture big fat obnoxious) guy comes lightning speed running out of nowhere (definitely not the line), dives into the next available potty, and locks it. 4 big angry (full-blattered) men from the line proceed to the potty with Big Obnoxious inside and begin to voice there anger with the situation by simply tipping over the potty with B.O. inside. No reaction. They return to the line. With fear, Potter proceeds to the next toilet (right beside B.O.), does his business with one foot perma- ready to bolt out the door, should things take a turn for the worst. When Potter exits, B.O. has still not budged from the now horizontal, and surely shaken-like-a-polaroid-pictured potty. Is B.O. dead? In shock? Crying for his mother? Or just crying (as Potter suggested he would be doing is such a sitch)? No one can say for sure...the lack of a non-intoxicated account of the business leaves things quite unfinished. Rumors spurned later on say police with an ambulance close at hand had to pry his embarrassed fat bastard body from the box and ship to the hospital due to non-physical damages.

       Ok so the other day I'm in the car with my mom and she's talking about how the daughter of a good friend of theirs is looking for a "good Christian boy".  So then my mom was all "You know, Jemmypoo, you could use a good Christian boy too.  Or you know, at least a hottie".  Honestly, my mom is too much 4 much sometimes.

       Date: Tue, 25 May 2004 20:49:01 -0400...  i forgot to tell you guys that today on my way to work, I walked to St. Laurent and was two seconds away from the door when this rather slick italian mob guy pulled a farmers' blow right in the front of me. it was 8:43am. outside of an ultra urban mall. he was a well suited man. and it was an outright farmers blow. needless to say, something has been off about this day ever since.

       chicas. i've got to tell you aboot the new ultimate mix i discovered this weekend: timmy's ice cap and cinnamon gum. seriously. try it. it's like a deep dish apple pie with french vanilla ice cream, but as a blended drink. more pls. (pls note: do NOT put the gum in the ice cap, but chew, then sip, then chew, then sip, then chew...you get the idea.) if you are feeling really devilish add vodka to taste.

       There was a time when i was 25.  puh-lease, it was hard enough for me to get to 25, let alone 26.  i'm now over-the-hill.  it's official.  i'm 30.  i should be married, have kids, at least be a MAID OF HONOUR jetta-style by now.  i am nothing.  all i can think about is that i'm constantly surrounded by doll-size babies?  i could rock jetta to sleep.  cumin, she's only 24!!  so i get a call from barbie this mornin' wishing me a happy 26er.  all of a sudden she starts giving out the following random tips:  1- don't try to act/sound too old.  nobody wants to sound like a 'lil ol' lady. 2- be careful of the wrinkles in your face (especially the lines around your mouth) 3- try not to gain weight  then she points out that in another 26 years i STILL won't be the same age as she is now.  that's supposed to make me feel betta??

       hi, this is jetta B. wetta, maid of honour. yes, that is actually how i was introduced to people the other day. people i've never met before. jetta, jetta the professional maid of honour. not that maid of honour is such a bad title, but it’s the aura it entails – yes, i'm not the bride, don’t mistake me for the bride, not that i want to be the bride, but i'm jetta, the maid of honour. it would be different if, for example i would be referred to as say lady jetta, or jetta, the producer who is also a part-time maid of honour. no. jetta, maid of honour. it wouldn’t sting so much, except that this is the second time that i have been jetta, the maid of honour. and i don’t really see it being the last. i guess it could be worse, like if i were just a maid, or a bridesmaid. i guess, i should look on the bright (?!?!) side, and see that of all the maids i have the most honour (which is in itself a lil meaningfully questionable) …but, c’mon: jetta the maid of honour? that’s no superheroin’s title. nobody wants that on their tombstone...and winner of the best supporting…er…maid of honour title: jetta B. wetta. oh yes, yes, i remember her, she ALMOST made it, she was in that wedding with Chris and Kristy McWilliams – aren’t they just the cutest couple?

       back in action. or back in inaction depending which way you dice it. don't ever listen to anyone who says if you keep on drinking the hangover will never come. they're prolly full of drugs and cum. 12 days. and now i'm paying for the 12 days of permahungness. i had grand plans for my van city, BC trip. but basically, it was a lot of getting hung -- hanging out, hanging around, hanging in there, and of course, the hangover. so, what did you do on your vaykay? apparently surfing, slutting, sleeping, drinking and drugs. (*thank God* for communication and recording devices or I wouldn't even have known.) if that's not time well wasted, i'm not sure I know anything anymore anytime anywhere...did you say something? just blow baby.  p.s. i'm so fucked. (that one's just for you jemmypoo.)

        you know what's awkward?  walking in on a couple DOING IT in an elevator... and then the silence all the way down from the seventh floor to the ground knowing that they are trying to stiffle their giggles while you're caught folding your arms and praying that the elevator would hurry the F up so that you can bust a move outta that bad boy.  it's bad enough that i'm not GETTING any, but do i really have to be subjected to elevator sex?!
