      I don't even know if that's a word...but anyways...  I just read an article this morning entitled, "Best Places to Die."  Is it just me, or does that seem to be going a bit far?  Wouldn't you rather read something about the best vacation spot or best beaches in the world or something?  Apparently not, no - "I'm gonna read this article so I know where to go when I'm about to die."  Are people really likely to move to another state just because it's better to die there?  Who are these people?!?!   Incidentally, Virginia is ranked #13.  Washington D.C. is #50.  Head south, my city-dwelling friends!!!

      Okay, so Jared is / was not the only reason for being happy at work. I tend to exaggerate. But those of you know me are going "DUH." I have resolved to try to write as little as possible about work on this site from now on. In closing, White Russians (the drinks, not the people) really can make everything seem better....  Finally, in tribute to Jared:  "Eh, buckle  THIS!!!"

      So as I'm sure you've all heard from me only a million times, work SUCKS!!!  Poor Jared got "let go" this morning, thus severing all ties to any form of happiness I had here.  Who the hell fires someone on a MONDAY?!?!?  So now I'm stuck doing all of his work AND mine, and no extra money.  Yes, it is time to go.....

      So as most of you know, I have been extremely unhappy at work lately.  However, instead of taking my anger out by contemplating all possible ways of disembowling, eviscerating, or otherwise planning the demise of my bosses, I have decided to start writing a book.  I know - it's a little presumptuous and most likely will never even come close to an actual book, but it's a better outlet than murder.  I'm assuming that I'll never let anyone read it, but nevertheless it beats playing solitaire.

      You know, you would think that downloading a picture into your profile would be relatively easy...over an hour later, I have succeeded.  I feel like such a moron.

      Okay - so here's the deal - this is not a blog about household pests that destroy your house.  For those of you who have heard this story, feel free to skip ahead; otherwise...  My older brother and I all used the same crib when we were babies.  Brand new when my sister was born, it was your run-of-the-mill crib.  As my parent's first child and a daughter at that, she got the nickname "Princess" from my father.  Pretty standard.  Apparently when she started teething, the plastic teething strip covering the edges of the wood was just begging to be destroyed.  My sister obliged, chewing the entire thing off.  When my brother inherited the crib, he couldn't be bothered with teething - he just wanted OUT.  The crib, housed in a room with hardwood floors, also had wheels.  Thus, when he woke up from his naps, he would announce it by running from one end of the crib to the other, causing it to roll across the floor and hit the opposite wall.  If that didn't work, he would turn around and try it again going the other direction.  As a last resort, he would stand in one corner (the same one every time, incidentally) and jump up and down until someone came and got him.  Which is how that one particular leg broke.  Strangely enough, this didn't earn him a nickname at all.  Go figure.  So as you can see, when I inherited the crib, this dilapidated, busted thing, there really wasn't much left to destroy.  Until I started teething...  Well, needless to say, the only thing left was the skeleton of the crib itself, the aforementioned wood, which would still bear teeth marks to this day...if it still existed.  Thus, my father nicknamed me Termite.  So that's the story.  Princess, no nickname and Termite.
