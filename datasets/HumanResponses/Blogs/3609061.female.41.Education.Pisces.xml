      For those of us on the east coast, we had to stay up close to 11PM for this gem. It was the most pointed political comment of the day. It came during Ron Reagan's comments at his father's grave.  "Dad was also a deeply, unabashedly religious man. But he never made the fatal mistake of so many politicians wearing his faith on his sleeve to gain political advantage. True, after he was shot and nearly killed early in his presidency, he came to believe that God had spared him in order that he might do good. But he accepted that as a responsibility, not a mandate. And there is a profound difference."   Ouch!! Guess he disagrees with John Ashcroft's notion of the divine right of kings.

      I've been completly disgusted by the current administration's embrace of torture. There has been some fabulous blogging on the leaked memo, beginning with the WSJ on Monday. Below is a link to serveral interesting, if damning, analyses. http://punishmenttheory.blog-city.com/  I've very quickly read the redacted memo once. But the reasoning behind it is that during a war the former Governor of Texas has the power to do most anything he wants, since he's commandar in chief.   Divine right of kings anyone???

      I've been desparately trying to avoid the media spectacle of Reagan's passing [he was my dissertation]. Unfortunately, my curiousity got the better of me and I sat through most of the funeral. For anyone with a background in religious education, theology, and/or church music [I confess to the last point], what was striking about the service was that it was an absolute theological smorgasboard: A little bit of Calvinism here, a little Catholicism there, a doplet of Anglicanism, etc.  While the service was in the "National" Cathedral, Reagan was no Episcopalian, but had been raised in the Christian Church [Disciple], which if memory services, is a mid-western variant of the old Congregationalist Church. Of course, he had been long "un-churched," [i.e. you wouldn't find him sitting next to you on Sunday] but that did not keep him from being popular with the Christian Right of his time.  During the funeral service, the Gospel was read by Cardinal Theodore "I wanna be Pope some day!" McCarrick, the homily was given by retired Senator, Rev. [Episcopal Church] John Danforth, and the Lord's prayer followed the Disciple version, which is why Danforth had to read it. None of the pols and world leaders who spoke were in the pulpit [which is appropriate], except for W [which is highly inappropriate]. The former Governor of Texas also used the kneeler as a footrest [really tacky!]. But then again, he's has taken on some divine musings. See http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1075950,00.html  Similarly, the music was a hodge-podge, some of it grossly inappropriate. In particular, the exit rite was more suitable for a military base closure than a religious service.  Through-out the Reagan send-off, I was struck the startling contrast between the theology set forth by a humble carpenter 2000 years ago and that which was literally trumpeted by those assembled and more obnoxiously, by the media. I guess these adherents have forgotten, "Blessed be the poor..."

      It seems our "Dear Leader" stumped at the Southern Baptist Convention annual "do."  This is sooo wrong on so many levels, I scarecly know where to begin.  1. Originally, the Baptists [writ large] were the staunchest adherents to strict separation of church and state. The church was not to be about "earthly" matters but to remain focused on the Kingdom of God. Any proposed mixture of the two was seen at best as problematic, at worst, literally the work of the devil.  2. The SBC has not be a font of Christian brotherhood. While their antipathy towards Muslims is well documented, they've not exactly been too welcoming of Roman Catholics. Hence, one would think they'd be a bit put off by Bush's papal trip only 2 weeks ago.  3. Fundamentalist Baptists were the most stringent proponents of separatism--Many did not even vote until the 1970s.  While I was raised in the American Baptist Convention, the basic tenet of separatism was very strong. In fact, as a HS student, I objected to reciting the Pledge of Alliegence, largely on religious grounds. I objected to the "Under God" phrase. Since humans cannot deign to know the mind of God, we can't make that claim. To do so, would invite God's wrath upon our collective hubris.  I can see that opinion would not gain favor with our current court system.    urlLink The New York Times > Washington > Campaign 2004 > Strategy: Bush Allies Till Fertile Soil, Among Baptists, for Votes

      Seems John Kerry is narrowing his choices for Veep.  I have one negative recommendation--Please, please, please, don't pick Dick Gephardt. Congressman Gephardt has run TWO failed presidential campaigns, blew it as democratic leader in the house, and has as much ELVIS [to quote Molly Ivins] as a musicology professor who's excited by Elizabethean dance forms [yes, someone has to have a passion, however...].   My own preference is John Edwards as veep. He's got Elvis by the truckload, is scary fast on his feet [unlike other pols I could think of], and would annihilate Cheney in any debate. Yes, the pundits will scoff at the "John-John" ticket, but I think the Bush/Pinochet team would be roadkill on election day.  The other thing the Dems need to do is get out the vote. My spies tell me a fair number of GOPers are going to sit on their hands come November. Fine, they might not be able to vote for W, and I can understand why a life-long GOP might wince pulling a lever for Kerry. HOWEVER, if they sit this one out, the election is the Dems to lose.

      This is very bad stuff indeed. It seems Rumsfeld "ordered military officials in Iraq last November to hold a man suspected of being a senior Iraqi terrorist at a high-level detention center there but NOT list him on the prison's rolls."  That's "disappering" someone. According to the Taguba report, this was "deceptive, contrary to Army doctrine, and in violation of international law."  Reflecting the administration's policy stances, perhaps Bush should replace Cheney with Pinochet!    urlLink The New York Times > Washington > Prison Abuse: Rumsfeld Issued an Order to Hide Detainee in Iraq

      The New York Times FINALLY gets that Bush and his cadres are liars. The editorial concludes with:  "Mr. Bush is right when he says he cannot be blamed for everything that happened on or before Sept. 11, 2001. But he is responsible for the administration's actions since then. That includes, inexcusably, selling the false Iraq-Qaeda claim to Americans. There are two unpleasant alternatives: either Mr. Bush knew he was not telling the truth, or he has a capacity for politically motivated self-deception that is terrifying in the post-9/11 world."

      Last week, "Achieve" released a report which was HARSHLY critical of High School graduation tests. OF course, they claimed that the data indicated US students are generally dumb as rocks.  Gerald Bracey, my favorite de-bunker, goes after that report with a chainsaw. Enjoy!  ************** I first flew in an airplane in 1961 at age 21, a twin-engine NASA prop from Langley Air Force Base to Cape Canaveral.  I experienced a little queasiness.  I had not had any problem since then until coming back from Detroit last night.  But I determined that the bad feelings in my gut didn't come from the turbulence rocking the A319, but from what I was reading: Do Graduation Tests Measure Up?  From Achieve, Inc.   I give only two horrific examples, one of spun and misleading statistics on page 8 and a baldly wrong statement on page 15.   One graph on page 8 purports to show that while only 48% of the class of 2003 passed the MA high stakes test, MCAS, in math, 95% of the class of 2003 eventually passed..  The graph is from the Massachusetts Department of Education, which should arouse immediate suspicions.  Izzy Stone's basic assumption applies: governments lie.  It should be yours, too.     The problem with the graph is that it does not account for those who dropped out or switched to GED or other programs (in Florida the number of kids getting a GED almost doubled from 2002 to 2003).  When those are taken into account, the pass rate drops into the 70's, lower in areas that are heavily black and Hispanic.  And, of course dropouts and GEDs occur more in minority groups.  Removing these students from the MCAS-taking sample would automatically raise their passing rate, which is relevant to the next graph discussed.   This other graph is labeled "achievement gap closing" and shows passing rates from 1998 to 2003 by ethnicity.  This graph is horsehockey.  The graph shows passing rates.  Passing rates tell you nothing about whether or not the achievement gap is closing.  To make a judgment about that, you need scores.  A passing rate shows you only how many kids jumped over the hurdle.  It gives no idea how high in the air they got.  My guess is that the minority kids who had to retake the test fell farther and farther behind as the white kids went on to study other stuff.  The report itself says "the tests are not overly demanding" (p. 1), so while minorities are confined to studying this not overly demanding content, those who passed the test moved on (only 29% of African Americans and 37% of Hispanics passed initially, compared to 77% of whites).   Here are some actual scores that do bear on the achievement gap:   In 1998, whites outscored blacks by 90 points on the SAT verbal and 96 points on the SAT math.  In 2003, whites outscored blacks by 93 points on the SAT verbal and 98 points on the SAT math.  Some reduction in the achievement gap!  (The ethnic composition of the SAT testtaking pool was virtually unchanged over the span of years).     Similarly, on NAEP 8th grade reading, the gap was 28 points in 1998 and 36 points in 2003, while the gaps on 8th grade math were 33 points in 1996 and 32 points in 2003.  Some closure.   I found theses data at the College Board and NAEP websites.  It took about 20 minutes including typing these paragraphs.  Mike Cohen, Achieve's President, and Matt Gandal, a vice president know about these sites and it wouldn't have taken them any longer than it took me, had they wanted to look.  But they didn't.  Why?  I don't know but it's clear that the intent of the report is to persuade, not inform.  In some places it reads like it was funded by test publishers.   A paragraph on page 15 begins "Because the performance of U . S. high school students in math lags behind that of students in other industrialized nations..."  This is simply not true.  Achieve is lying to you.   In 2000, OECD tested 15-year-olds in 32 mostly industrialized nations in reading, math and science.  The U. S. was average in all three subjects.  But...only three countries had significantly higher scores in reading, only eight in math, and only seven in science.  Most of the countries did not differ significantly from one another (http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/2002115a.pdf).    Even in the Final Year apples-to-aardvarks study of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, the groups of American students most like their European and Asian peers were in the middle of the pack--right where they had been as 8th grades (see my critique of this study in the May, 2000 Educational Researcher).  Oh, by the way, while many final year students in Europe and Asia were getting ready for their national, life-determining exams, ours, knowing what at least the immediate the future held, suffered senior slump.  TIMSS tested American high school seniors with a test that meant absolutely nothing to them in the merry month of May (!).   Among the several thousand people receiving this post are about 800 education writers.  I urge them--and actually all of you--to be more critical of stuff like this bubbling up from the bowels of Achieve.     This report should never have been published, much less publicized.  Michael Kinsley once called the Heritage Foundation a propaganda machine masquerading as a think tank.  Achieve is working hard to assume that mantle as well.   Sincerely,   Gerald W. Bracey

Originally, the only Baptist doctrine was there was  no  doctrine.  What on earth do I mean???  Basically, the most important article of faith for Baptists is that of an informed,  individual conscience . The church is supposed to help on the "informed" part, but ultimately, the power of individual conscience must be respected. Hence the joke: Get two Baptists in a room and you'll get five opinions.  Of course, when the SBC embraced Christian Reconstructionism in 1979, this was the first article of faith to go...   urlLink Yahoo! News - Southern Baptists Quit World Alliance

And I turned to Vice President Cheney, who was there, and I said, "Mr. Vice President, I wouldn't keep you if it weren't constitutionally required." I turned back to the president and said, "Mr. President, Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld are bright guys, really patriotic, but they've been dead wrong on every major piece of advice they've given you.

While Bush-Cheney was never popular in Manahatten (except, perhaps in isolated sections of the Financial District), they've obviously lost the Bronx as well.  From AMERICAblog   Cheney just got booed at the Yankees game    (I was thinking of retitling this: "Yankee fans tell Cheney 'go fuck yourself.'")  I just got a live phone-in from the Yankees vs. Boston game in NYC taking place right now. Dick Cheney just got booed by the crowd!   Even as my friend Michael called me from his seats at the game, God Bless America was still playing in the background. During the 7th inning stretch at Yankees Stadium, they play God Bless America and show on the big screen pictures of anyone famous who's in the audience that night. Dick Cheney is apparently in the audience, and as soon as his face went up, the entire crowd started booing! As my friend Michael tells it, this is the blue-collar Bronx we're talking about, and Cheney is still getting booed - not a good sign for the Bush-Cheney ticket. As soon as the camera guys realized Cheney was getting booed, they quickly switched the picture on the screen to someone else.  Michael's read of the situation, as a die-hard Yankees fan: The election is over.

      My partner and I went to the 2 PM showing at the Montgomery Theatre on June 25th. The theatre is in suburban Princeton [no, not a redundancy], so the crowd was very lefty. We got there at 1:30 to be sure we got tickets. When we came out at 4:20, it was clear the 4:30 showing was sold out.  Anyway, it's a fabulous movie. There are a few surprises regarding information, but most of it I already knew. However, it's a MOVING film. I won't mention how he presented the 9/11 attacks, but I found myself sobbing shortly into it. Normally, I don't react at all to the 9/11 stuff because I've seen most of it, but Moore is a genius.   Moore also gets at the pathos of the US recruits who land in Iraq. Of course, the kids are poor and working class, who joined the Army to escape tough economic circumstances as well as genuine and fierce love for the USA. He focuses on kids from his hometown of Flint, MI, but the kids could have easily come from Knoxville, PA, which is where I grew up [think Northern Appalachia].  Fahrenheit is playing in Manville, NJ, which is a big surprise. Manville used to be home of Johns Manville, the biggest, baddest maker of asbestos. When the company was going full throttle in the 50s and 60s, it would actually SNOW asbestos over the town in the afternoon. Needless to say, it's now a SAD town that is poor and working class. There are all manner of military recruiting stations located in Manville. And of course, the local VFW and American Legions are important and PROMINENT cultural institutions. But, the local theatre obviously thinks the movie will be popular with residents. It's also a fiercely UNION town, so in that vein, it's much like Flint.  Anyway, it's a movie that has defined an era. It's not to be missed.

      From the Washington Post  urlLink Bush Rallies Faithful in Keystone State (washingtonpost.com)   I spent the past weekend in PA visiting friends and relatives. I'm from the North-Central region, which has been solidly Republican since the Civil War.  That said, I was SHOCKED by the number of life-long Republicans who are GIVING money and their votes to Kerry. For example, one elderly gentleman, whom I have known literarlly for my entire life and with whom I have sparred over politics, is a former county District Attorney and life-long GOP activist. He has even attended the GOP convention as a delegate (1964).  However, he's supporting Kerry, both with his vote and $$. My jaw literally dropped in shock. He also hoped that Kerry would pick Edwards as his running mate (we chatted on Sunday, July 4th).   Once I gathered my wits, I asked him, "why?"  His reponse: "Because George Bush and his administration are lying bastards. They, as well Tom DeLay and Pat Robertson,  don't represent me or my values."  His wife quickly intejected that she's been contemplating switching parties because she is SO disgusted.  I can't tell you how shocked I am by this. It's sort of like being half-awake at 5 AM, stumbling towards the refridgerator for some breakfast and finding Fidel Castro sitting there (thanks to Molly Ivins). I'm just absolutely flumuxed by this development. This gentleman has worked for the GOP in various capacities for almost 50 years. He's a regular church go-er, professional, white, solidly upper-middle class. And utterly HOSTILE towards the Bush White House.  Since the Pravda on the Potomac doesn't interview REAL people, I believe they're missing a major story.

      Normally, reading Nick Kirstof in the NYTimes makes me wince--in anger. This time, he's nailed an issue.  He takes on the "Left Behind" series by Tim LaHay. Here's a snip: *********** If a Muslim were to write an Islamic version of "Glorious Appearing" and publish it in Saudi Arabia, jubilantly describing a massacre of millions of non-Muslims by God, we would have a fit. We have quite properly linked the fundamentalist religious tracts of Islam with the intolerance they nurture, and it's time to remove the motes from our own eyes.  In "Glorious Appearing," Jesus merely speaks and the bodies of the enemy are ripped open. Christians have to drive carefully to avoid "hitting splayed and filleted bodies of men and women and horses."   ... No, I don't think the readers of "Glorious Appearing" will ram planes into buildings. But we did imprison thousands of Muslims here and abroad after 9/11, and ordinary Americans joined in the torture of prisoners at Abu Ghraib in part because of a lack of empathy for the prisoners. It's harder to feel empathy for such people if we regard them as infidels and expect Jesus to dissolve their tongues and eyes any day now.     urlLink The New York Times > Opinion > Op-Ed Columnist: Jesus and Jihad

      Today's Washington Post has an article that examines young people and rural poverty.   Briefly, while the percentage of urban poor is 16%, for the rural poor it's over 20%. Furthermore, poor rural children have less access to medical care, dental care, and a host of social services, governmental and non-profit.  This is consistent with what I've been seeing in my home town, which is located in Northern PA, in the foothills of Appalachia.   I've seen families devasted by the lack of health insurance, particularly when a child is diagnosed with cancer. The local people will do their best for the family running all manner of fundraisers, but as they saying goes, "You can't get blood from a stone."  Needless to say, the area leads the nation in per-capita military enlistments. With the military, a person gets a regular salary, regular health and dental care (the quality is questionable, but something is generally better than nothing), and somewhat decent housing. Of course, you do run the rise of going to Iraq. But the benefits are more than what many of these kids have ever seen.

Mr. Falwell said he often did this at his church, the Thomas Road Baptist Church.  "I support President Bush,'' he said. "I support him on Sunday mornings from the pulpit where it doesn't cost the church or anybody anything. I make it very clear, just like at most African-American churches and many liberal churches, that as a tax-paying citizen I vote. And I tell people who I vote for." *** Falwell is right, that he does have a first amendment right to tell his parishoners who he's voting for and who they should vote for. But if he does so, he can't keep is CHARITABLE status.

      Below is a link to Bob Herbert's column in today's NYTimes.  Here are a few snips. ***** What is troubling is Mr Bush's relationship with black Americans in general. He's very good at using blacks as political props. And the proposa are too often part of an exceedingly cyncial production.  Four years ago, on the first night of the Republican convention, a parade of blacks was hauled before the television cameras (and the nearly all-white audience in the convention hall) to sing, to dance, to preach and to praise a party that has been relentlessly hostile to the interests of blacks for half a century.  I wrote at the time that "you couldn't tell whether you were at the Republican National Convention or the Motown Review."  That exercise in modern-day minstrelsy was supposed to show that Mr. Bush was a new kind of Republican, a big-tent guy who would welcome a more diverse crowd into the G.O.P. That was fiction. It wasn't long before black voters would find themselves mugged in Florida, and soon after that Mr. Bush was steering the presidency into a hard-right turn.  ***** Bush is the worst sort of pol--Smile to your face, kiss your kids so long as the cameras are rolling. Then, once the cameras are long gone, have his minions knife you in the back...repeatedly.  That said, Kerry has got to a better job reaching out to African American communities. He needs to incorporate the all of the African American 30-ish and 40-ish year olds who cut their political teeth working in the Clinton administrastration and for the Gore campaign. Clinton and Gore did a relatively good job giving folks from all sorts of backgrounds national political experience.  Kerry ignores this experienced talent at his peril.   urlLink The New York Times > Opinion > Op-Ed Columnist: Bush's Not-So-Big Tent

      BTW: He's got a fabulous staff. Enjoy! ************************ Thank you for contacting me about the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment.  I appreciate hearing from you on this issue.       The United States Constitution provides the framework for our government and the foundation upon which our laws are based, and it is the primary guarantor of individual freedoms.  It is a document of critical importance, and I believe it should be amended only in extremely rare circumstances.       The Federal Marriage Amendment that has been introduced in Congress provides that "marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman.  Neither this Constitution or the constitution of any State, nor State or Federal law, shall be construed to require that marital status or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon unmarried couples or groups."       I believe that this proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution on marriage is unwarranted.  Current federal law, the Defense of Marriage Act, P.L. 104-199, prohibits federal recognition of same-sex marriages and allows individual States to recognize or refuse to recognize such marriages performed in another State.  Furthermore, proposed civil union laws in several States, including New Jersey, provide significant benefits, such as health and retirement benefits, to gays and lesbians in a demonstrated, committed relationship.       Finally, with the exception of prohibition of alcohol -- which was repealed -- this would be the first amendment to our Constitution that expressly restricts individual rights.  This would be a most unfortunate shift in the heritage of our Constitution as a symbol of civil liberties and the use of amendments to expand individual rights.       For these reasons, I do not support the initiative to pass a Federal Marriage Amendment.  Thank you again for contacting me.

      Mel Martinez (GOP) is running for the US Senate from Florida. Today, he released a radio ad in which he equates the move towards gay marriage to living under a totalitarian regime, like Castro's.  The logic on that is completely loopy. But it gets worse. Martinez's campaign finance chair is an out gay men.  Hence, my little e-mail note. (FYI) kirk@melforsenate.org ******************* Dear Mr. Fordham:  I understand that you are the finance chairman for Mel Martinez’s Senatorial campaign.  I have just listened to Mr. Martinez’s campaign ad in which he compares extending civil rights to gays and lesbians to living under Fidel Castro.  *HUH?!!!!*  Castro has long persecuted gays and lesbians.   Martinez is officially against extending civil rights for gays and lesbians.  Since Castro is hostile towards gays and lesbians and Martinez’s central campaign theme is hostility towards gays and lesbians could you please explain why Martinez is not like Castro???  I eagerly await your response.  PS: As a gay man, you should know better than to fund this crap. For Shame!

      This is VERY worrisome. The Red Cross suspects the US is making terror suspects "disappear." According to the AP article posted on Salon.com:  "Terror suspects reported by the FBI as captured have never turned up in detention centers, and the United States has failed to reply to agency demands for a list of everyone it's holding, said Antonella Notari, spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross. "  Making folks disappear, who may or may not be threats to the state, is a brown-shirt tactic. If our fearless leaders truly believed in democracy, they would follow long-established rules of law.

      From the NY Times   urlLink The New York Times > Education > Grading Mistakes Caused More Than 4,000 Would-Be Teachers to Fail a Licensing Exam   I'm not wild about standardized tests--they're a crude instrument, at best, to determine most anything about humans.  But lately, they've become the equivalent to taking a blood oath to prove one's worthiness. Of course, since kids don't vote or give campaign contributions (except for rich kids), they're subjected to the vast majority of tests.  Teachers are another segement of society that routinely get standardized tests crammed down their collective throats. The article gets an a critical point: "There is more public oversight of the pet-food industry than there is for test makers."  Stay tuned....

      Yesterday was a good day in my state. New Jersey's Domestic Partnership law came into effect. It covers LGBT people as well as non-queer people who co-habitate who are past the age of 62.  It is considerably LESS than marriage, and actually expands heterosexual priviledges for those non-queer folks over 62. Since non-queer folks who are DP'ed aren't legally married, I doubt their respective social security surviorship benefits, widow/widower pensions would be threatened [Survivorship benefits can be threatened upon re-marrying].  That said, for queer folks, Domestic Partnership is much better than nothing. Queer partners are now officially recognized by various branches of bureacracy. This is vitally important: For example, fy partner faced cancer surgery 3 years ago. While the fine folks at the hospital recognizing me as her partner, the bureaucracy insisted that her sister in Georgia be listed as next of kin. The hospital staff was great, supportive and queer friendly. Nevertheless, LEAGALLY, I was a stranger to her.  It was a searing experience.  At least in NJ, this will not happen again for queer DP'ers. But it's also under attack by the former governor of Texas and his cronies. This week the US Senate will take up the Federal Marriage Amendment, or what I call "Writing homophobia into the US Constitution."   I suggest that LGBT people who are partnered get registered ASAP. Otherwise, you may never be able to if these brown shirts win.

      Bush has a serious problem with the NAACP and it's HIS problem.   1. He blows off the annual convention, the first president who's refused to attend a single convention during his 4-year term.  2. Then he decides to be insulting. To quote the article in the Chicago Tribune, "There are a lot of people I admire in the NAACP," Bush said. But he added, "I describe my relationship with the current leadership as basically non-existent because of their rhetoric."  Ok...Mr. Bush name one person. C'mon.... you can do it. We're waiting.... Uh huh...I thought so.   W has employed the old, "The group is ok, but the leadership is lousy" canard when dissing a long-established African American social justice organization. He makes himself transparent when he says, "there are a lot of people.."  BTW: This is also the same weekend that Bush endorsed the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would ban "gay-marriages" in the US.

      No! Not THAT one silly, the former head of the Florida Christian Coalition, who now works for Mel Martinez's senatorial campaign.  What a PIECE of work.   From the Washington Blade.  Just a fast snip: ************* Throughout his career, both at the Christian Coalition and after, Dowless has had a long history of pushing an anti-gay agenda.  As far back as 1994, Dowless, then the director of the Christian Coalition of Florida, was quoted in the New York Times opposing the popular Gay Days event at Disney World in Orlando because it allegedly was a threat to kids.  “This whole day is focusing on sex,” Dowless was quoted as saying, “and when you put these elements together, there is the greater possibility of illegal activities on children or some harassment.”  In 1997, Dowless, still in his role as director of the state’s Christian Coalition, cheered when the University of Florida rescinded a student spouse ID card that had been given to the partner of a lesbian student. The card gave spouses of students special advantages, such as use of the university’s libraries and recreational facilities.  “Marriage should be reserved for a man and a woman,” Dowless told the Alligator, the student publication.  In 1998, Dowless successfully blocked a move by the state legislature to write the Religious Freedom Restoration Act into the state Constitution. The move would have prohibited discrimination based on a variety of attributes, including gender.   But, according to the St. Petersburg Times, Dowless opposed the gender provision, saying it would be a possible loophole for allowing same-sex marriages.  And in 2002, Dowless created a misleading phone message for Gov. Jeb Bush. The message, sent to 50,000 social conservatives in the state, claimed that voters should cast their lot with Bush over Democratic rival Bill McBride because Bush was “the only candidate who supports traditional marriage.”  But the statement was false. McBride did oppose same-sex marriage, and after a public controversy, the phone message campaign was pulled.  Just last year, Dowless was scheduled as one of 25 guest speakers at a “Reclaiming America for Christ” conference held Oct. 24-25 in Fort Lauderdale. Promotional materials indicate he spoke about grassroots organizing among conservative Christians.  ****** Now, would some one please explain again why outing is a bad thing??????    urlLink Washington Blade Online

      Dear Mr. and Mrs. G. H. W. Bush,&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Once again, it is that time of year when we update the parents of our students on their child's progress, and we regret to inform you that your son, Georgie, is not doing as well as we'd hoped and expected when he embarked on his four-year program at our school.  &nbsp;  As you are well aware, Georgie was installed as class president at the start of the school year, despite the fact that the majority of his fellow students did not vote for him. We foresaw problems immediately, but were assured by several school board members (who, as we understand it, are friends of your family) that this would not result in any real difficulty. Unfortunately, they have been proven wrong.  &nbsp;  In the area of scholastic achievement, despite our best efforts, Georgie is still reading and speaking at a grade level far below our usual standards. At this point, we are not sure if his failure to learn is due to laziness and a lack of ability to apply himself to his studies, or if he simply lacks the intellectual capacity to improve in these areas.  &nbsp;  His oral presentations to the class are particularly troubling; it is apparent that Georgie has not read the necessary materials, and he often simply fabricates facts to hide this shortcoming. In oral exams, he tends to repeat the same answers over and over, e. g. "The economy is good; jobs are on their way," indicating a profound failure to keep up with the Current Events portion of the curriculum.  &nbsp;  Georgie also tends to fabricate elaborate stories about himself - which, admittedly, can sometimes be very amusing. During a school celebration last May, he delighted his fellow students by coming to class in a little "flight suit" (just like the grown-ups wear!), and had everyone in stitches with his story about the family dog having eaten his report card from military pre-school!  &nbsp;  On the whole, however, Georgie does not play well with other children. His "leadership" in the classroom continues to divide many students, one against the other. Other study groups, such as our French and German-language classes, are no longer willing to cooperate with Georgie's group, even though they have traditionally done so in the past.  &nbsp;  Your son also displays a lack of taking responsibility for his failings, and seems unable to appreciate the consequences of his actions. Although he was provided with the best textbooks on the subjects of the Economy, Job Creation, The Environment, et cetera, these books were damaged or completely destroyed within a matter of months. Georgie insists that he "inherited" these books in poor condition, despite all evidence to the contrary. (In fact, these same textbooks were previously used by one of our very best students, who actually returned them in better condition than he found them!)  &nbsp;  During his first few weeks with us, Georgie quickly became part of a group of other "problem students." Despite warnings, he has consistently befriended children whom we consider to be "bad elements," such as Little Kenny Lay and a foreign-exchange student named Chalabi. Both of these youngsters have been expelled from other schools due to their involvement in cheating other students out of their lunch money. We feel that these kinds of relationships can only lead to no good, and hope that you will advise your child accordingly.  &nbsp;  Georgie often displays aggressive behavior in the schoolyard, and recently assaulted a student in another school district, completely unprovoked. When asked about this incident, Georgie insisted that the other child was armed and dangerous. When investigation into the matter proved otherwise, Georgie changed his story several times: he was just trying to "democratize" the other child, the other child's school was harboring gang members, and so on. Quite frankly, his story on this topic has so changed from week to week, we simply can't trust his word at all anymore.  &nbsp;  Georgie's friends, while not great in number, are very loyal, but tend to be over-protective. If any of the other students point out Georgie's failing grades, these friends simply shout them down and tell them not to speak at all. When Georgie was summoned to the principal's office several weeks ago, he insisted that his "best friend" come with him. We feel that it is in Georgie's best interest to learn to stand up for himself; failure to do so could seriously damage his ability to handle a leadership role in his adult years.  &nbsp;  As you are aware, final exams will be held in November, and Georgie's past performance leads us to conclude that he will not be able to achieve the grades necessary to continue on with another four-year term at our institution.  &nbsp;  Yours Truly,  Ms. J. Q. Public, Assistant Principal

      From the NY Times...   Here's the backgrounder on this issue. Back in the 1980s, the Reagan administration, then Bush administration systematically CUT OFF black farmers from Agricultural subsidies that they were legally entitled to, while at the same time funded larger, white-owned and controlled, agricultural coroporations (Think con-agra, monsanto, etc).   I remember seeing an interview with the head of the program during this time. He's was just increadibly bigoted (BTW: My dissertation was on the Reagan administration--they used to place the most bigoted and numbed headed racists in the domestic agencies).  Anyway, the results for black farmers&nbsp;were devastating...   The farmers filed a class-action&nbsp;suit and finally reached a settlement with USDA in the mid-1990s.  And now, the current Bush administration is&nbsp;denying these same farmers (9 out of 10) the settlement money that they are legally entitled to.  It's evil, evil, evil crap.    urlLink The New York Times > Washington > Black Farmers Accuse Agriculture Dept. of Failing to Live Up to Racial Bias Settlement

      From the Capital Times, Madison Wisconsin...  Here's a snip:  So why is the president lying about a supposed threat posed by allowing same-sex couples to marry?  Why is he attempting to demean the country's most important document by smearing it with an official sanction of discrimination?  Out of respect for the president and his office, we suggest that he is a bigot.  The alternative would be to suggest that he is a political cynic who continues to push an amendment to the Constitution that will never be enacted - in part because key senators from his own party oppose the amendment - in order to gain political advantage.  If he is a cynic, then he is also a fool.

In fact, he has several - and in typically robust fashion, he is demanding answers. What he wants to know is whether the Bush administration has been fiddling with Iraq's oil revenues.   He wrote to the Republican chairman of the reform committee on July 9, suggesting there was a serious case to answer. Subpoenas should be issued, he said, 'to investigate potential mismanagement of the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI) by the United States'.   The DFI was set up after last year's invasion as the depository for Iraq's multi-billion-dollar oil revenues and was administered, until June 28, by the US-led Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) - with notional UN oversight.  In particular, Mr Waxman is curious about 'the [Bush] administration's last-minute 'draw-down' of billions of dollars from the DFI for unspecified expenses' prior to last month's transfer of sovereignty. 'For example, $1bn [about �550m] was withdrawn from the DFI during the last month of the CPA's existence for unspecified 'security' purposes.'    urlLink Guardian Unlimited | Special reports | How has the US been spending other people's billions? : "How has the US been spending other people's billions?

During his Midwest swing, he promised to protect those homeland values from the latest big threats: gays who marry and Hollywood entertainers who support Democrats. Bush did not quite equate gay marriages with Al Qaeda, as Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Rick Santorum did: "Isn't that the ultimate homeland security — standing up and defending marriage?"

All the untruths."   His wife said she too was switching. The Republicans carried Tennessee in 2000, even though it was the home state of Democratic nominee Al Gore.  At the same market Ron King, a black Vietnam Veteran, said: "I always voted Republican before but I'm against Bush ever since I found out that he doesn't love this country. His so-called military record is a sham. And the worst part is that he lies so much. He lied about weapons of mass destruction."   Lloyd Huff, 64, retired director of the Dayton Research Institute in Ohio, says he has "voted for a Republican in every presidential election I can remember" but it will be Kerry this time because "the Bush administration has been the most deceitful, duplicitous, secretive administration this country has ever had."

      Take some pepto before you read this puppy.  Why is the Times a liberal paper, according to their "public editor," Daniel Okrent?  Because they cover gay marriage, and generally don't cite right-wing bigots in their coverage.  What Okrent ignores is the Times was the most homphobic of mainstream papers (See Alwood's "Straight News," 1996 Columbia University Press). Okrent's reasoning is that since it's generally neutral on queer issues, it's now a liberal paper.  Rightttt.... See the Wen Ho Lee Scandal, the endless Clinton bashing, the weird coverage of John Kerry, etc. etc.  What Okrent's column demonstrates, is not that the NYTimes is a liberal paper, but that their "public editor" has a real problem with queer people.    urlLink The New York Times > Week in Review > The Public Editor: Is The New York Times a Liberal Newspaper?

      The New York Times finally covers the outing story.  Here's a snip: ********** The election-year fight over gay marriage has altered the gay scene here in ways that have left some in the community - most notably gay Republicans - stunned and even fearful. Under intense pressure to separate their gay consciousness from their broader political identity, gay and lesbian conservatives are facing stinging ridicule in the very neighborhoods, bars and restaurants that were once unquestioned safe zones.   In recent weeks Lynden C. Armstrong, administrative director for Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, an opponent of gay marriage, has been called "a Jew working for Nazis," and "a gay Uncle Tom." During a recent dinner at a Washington restaurant, a friend loudly berated Mr. Armstrong in front of other patrons. He was even confronted about his political allegiance during a weekend getaway in Rehoboth Beach, Del., again, by people he considered friends.  "I don't feel like I'm being attacked by anyone in my office," said Mr. Armstrong, 33, who is also co-chairman of the Gay, Lesbian and Allies Senate Staff Caucus. "The attacks have come from other gays and lesbians, and that's hard. It's very hard for me to understand how they can do that. Most people know how difficult this all is for all of us."  The tension experienced by Mr. Armstrong and others has been ratcheting up since February when President Bush formally endorsed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. But it has reached fever pitch in the past two weeks, since Mike Rogers, a gay activist in Washington, began posting on the Internet the names of gays who work for lawmakers supporting the amendment.   "It's about exposing hypocrisy wherever we find it," Mr. Rogers said.   ******** Poor, poor conservative queers. They work for brownshirt pols who campaign against queers, then they cry foul when other queers call them on their hypocrasy. Get over it.  The campaign is also designed to out the pols who spout crap, but are perfectly fine with queers, so long as we are silent.

      Jeanna Bush is on record of saying she would like to teach, and thinks she'd do a good job teaching in Harlem.  Now....Let's talk about the arrogence and itty bitty dollop of racism wrapped up in that pronouncement. Better yet, check out the following from the NY Daily News...not exactly a bastion of progressive thinking. ********** Jenna is unwanted  Not everyone wants Jenna Bush to teach in Harlem.   Artists and Activists United for Peace, a black and Latino public-action group, plans to express its displeasure with the First Daughter at a rally on Sept. 2, during the Republican National Convention.  "We don't think she is of a high enough moral character to teach school, considering her past adventures," said group organizer John Penley. "Her taking this job is keeping a black person from getting the job. We think she and her sister should enlist in the military."  ********** Actually, her run-ins with the law combined with a teeny tiny drinking problem might keep her from getting a teaching license. Then there are all those "morality clauses" which still lurk in most agreements.  Hmmmm...Any bets on Jenna actually teaching anywhere???   urlLink New York Daily News - Daily Dish & Gossip - Rush & Molloy: Martha's next move may soon be to jail :

      Check out the fabulous op-ed by Mark Morford.  Here's a snip: ******** You know it's time for a serious change when the president of the United States actually mutters the infantile, instantly infamous line, "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we," just after finishing phonetically spelling out his name, in his favoritest red crayon, on yet another budget-reaming $417 billion defense-spending bill.  And you know it's time for a change when not a single one of the rigid and spiritually curdled military yes men standing around the ceremonial signing table, those sad automatons with their wooden smiles and stiff spines and bone-dry souls, not one broke into a hysterical bout of sad, suicidal laughter, followed by uncontrolled wailing and the rending of flesh and the muttering of oh my freaking God what the hell is this man doing as leader of the free world.   You know it's time for a change when you hear that Kerry and Edwards both wrote their own riveting, galvanizing acceptance speeches at the Democratic National Convention, heartfelt and effective rhetoric that gives you hope not for the quality of polished oratory but for genuine, refreshing political intellect, and verbal acumen, as you offer deep thanks that at least some politicians can still speak coherently and cogently without mangling the goddamn language at every adjectival clause.   Whereas you just know Dubya isn't capable of writing a single word of his own speeches, and will employ entire squadrons of lackeys to do it for him at the RNC, and will regardless still insist on mispronouncing "nukuler" and "'Murka" and "terrist" and "gin bender at Yale," and will doubtlessly say something like, "We must stamp out evil in all its forms because evil wants to do evil things to us and evil don't know the depths of its own, uh, evilnesses. Praise Jesus."   ****** It gets to the heart of why I'm personally disgusted with W. He's incompetent to lead a prayer circle, much less the US.   urlLink Time To Get Out The Bush / How do you know it's time for a major change in American leadership?

      here's something that hasn't been too well covered in the US yet. Seems like the Bushies outed a spy who was operating inside al Qaeda.  Why???  To show they are wining (???) the war on terror.   A few Snips From the New Zealand Herald  LONDON - The revelation that a mole within al Qaeda was exposed after Washington launched its "orange alert" this month has shocked security experts, who say the outing of the source may have set back the war on terror.   Reuters learned from Pakistani intelligence sources at the weekend that computer expert Mohammad Naeem Noor Khan, arrested secretly last month, was working under cover to help the authorities track down al Qaeda militants in Britain and the United States when his name appeared in newspapers around the world.   .... Security experts said they were shocked by the revelations that the source whose information led to the alert was identified within days, and that US officials had confirmed his name.   "The whole thing smacks of either incompetence or worse," said Tim Ripley, a security expert who writes for Jane's Defence publications.   "You have to ask: what are they doing compromising a deep mole within al Qaeda, when it's so difficult to get these guys in there in the first place?   "It goes against all the rules of counter-espionage, counter-terror-ism, running agents and so forth. It's not exactly cloak and dagger undercover work if it's on the front pages every time there's a development, is it?"     urlLink New Zealand News - World - Outing of spy stuns security experts

      Tom Coburn is the GOP senate Candidate for OK.  He really likes (NOT!) his queer Oklahomans.  Here's a snip from the article:  Last year to the Rogers County Republicans he said, “… The gay community has infiltrated the very centers of power in every area across this country, and they wield extreme power. ... That agenda is the greatest threat to our freedom that we face today. Why do you think we see the rationalization for abortion and multiple sexual partners? That’s a gay agenda.”  *** Inflitrated???? Extreme Power?? Shades of nazi-type rhetoric. You can replace "gays" with "Jews" and see where he maybe going.  Scary, scary, scary.   urlLink Out there�way far out there (from the OK Gazette)

      The Illinois GOP really is desparate. Their goldboy flames out, Ditka says "no," and so they import Alan Keyes, a conservative huckster extrodinaire, to run against Barak Obama.  Too bad Keyes doesn't pay his taxes.  Not only will Keyes be road kill on election day, but the Illinois GOP has now managed to look desparate, silly and totally irrelevant.  WWLT?

      Below is a great editorial on the Abu Ghraib scandal.  Here's just a snip:  THE PRETRIAL HEARING for Pfc. Lynndie R. England has the makings of a show trial. The military parades this pregnant, unmarried 21-year-old clerk in front of the world as one of a handful of rogue MPs responsible for the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison. Meanwhile, back at the Pentagon, officials huddle in their bunkers seeking to avoid responsibility.   Pentagon prosecutors have managed to unearth the details of Ms. England's sexual escapades with Spc. Charles A. Granger Jr., the alleged ringleader of the rogue police. But the Pentagon has been unable to muster the effort to probe the details of 94 documented cases of prison abuse, including 40 deaths.  . . .   In this light, there is something absurd about pinning a scarlet letter on a pathetic - though perverse - 21-year-old private from West Virginia, while the president and the secretary of defense skate.   urlLink STLtoday - News - Story

      Hi Folks:  Sorry there's not been an update. I've been traveling. ANyway, below is a post to the latest snafu from Johnny Ashcroft's Department of Injustice. Actually, it's looking like the keystone kops, with apologies to the Commonwealth of PA.  Here's a snip:  ************** WASHINGTON (AP) - Prosecutors in the first major terror trial after Sept. 11 were hindered by superiors from presenting some of their most powerful evidence, including testimony from an al-Qaida leader and video footage showing Osama bin Laden's European operatives casing American landmarks, Justice Department memos show.  The department's terrorism unit "provided no help of any kind in this prosecution," the U.S. Attorney's office in Detroit wrote in one of the memos, which detail bitter divisions between front-line prosecutors and their superiors in Washington ************* But then again, going after women's medical records is far more important. (Johnny is just a bit cuckoo about abortion).  GRRRRRRR!!!!   urlLink iWon News
