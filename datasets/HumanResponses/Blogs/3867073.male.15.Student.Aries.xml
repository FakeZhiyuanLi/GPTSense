      I had a lesson with dolph today. we talked a bit about how my tournament was yesterday, and figured out that if everything over a five was a five, I would have&nbsp;fired a&nbsp;79. Any way, my irons were pretty good if I took my weight back to my right foot fully, so he lectured Tom Buley and&nbsp;me about that a bit. Then my balance was a bit kinky, so he put me on&nbsp;a foam balance board shaped like a semicircle and had me take every position (standing, stance, coiled, and follow-through) all in balance. It took me a while to get the&nbsp;hang of it, but eventually I did it right and I was able to sense my balance a lot better on the ground. Then he handed me the driver... With my increased balance, the focus shifted back to getting my weight back and then my hands pulling my body through. I was bombing 220 yarder after 220 yarder reasonably straight, and my misses were blocks when my hips came through too quickly. Dolph says those are better mishits than snap hooks because they land softer (I know that from experience). So his quote was the title of this post "just bore your playing partners with nice short straight shots". We tried to see what happened if I tried to crank my swing into a higher gear, but when I&nbsp;do that my old habit of hips first comes through and I put the ball out right. He says I shouldn't worry about working the ball too much, just hitting it straight. I can also tee the ball higher and play it further forward in my stance on all shots. This will give it a bit more hang time and softer landings. Tommorow I may play nine or just practice before flying out to california at 5 o'clock. So it was a good lesson.

      I played in a IJGA Regional tournament today at Paltine hills golf course. It was a really nice course for a muni, the tips yardage of 6800 should clue you in to that. It played long and hard even though we weren't playing from the tips, mostly because it was still over 6500 yards and the long par fours were relentless.The only one under 350 was the eighth at 320, and every thing else ranged from 355 to 445 yards. The par fives were relatively shorter, but that was no consolation as I played the four of them&nbsp;at nine over. So now more about me. I shot a 90, which netted me 25th place in a field of 60 posted scores. The greens were super fast down hill and somewhat slow uphill, and that threw me off for 39 putts :(. I probably would have been more confident with their speed if I were used to the greens, but the practice green maybe threw me off more than helped me. I finally had a birdie, the first time in a while. One the eighteenth I had a pretty good drive (a 370 par 4) and a eight iron which with the help of a good kick rolled to two feet below the pin. five pars complemented the round ending birdie, but two doubles, a triple and a four putt quad threw those out (compared to bogey golf). I started both of the nines well, going par-par and par-3putt bogey on 1,2 and 10,11. Five greens in regulation for the day, all of them coming when my drive was in the fairway (or a par three). It was also obvious to me that when I one putted, my score on the hole was lower than average (one under), and three putts hurt the average (worse than double bogey golf). I had an epiphany about dealing with bad drives. If, on a par four, I have a bad drive, lets say a two hundred yard hook into the left trees, If I can advance the ball and put it in the fairway, I can then put it on the green and two putt for bogey, not a bad score for having&nbsp;a drive in the trees. I used that theory on a couple of holes to scramble and it worked well. The eighteenth hole at winnetka might be a prime canidate for this mindset. To recap, 90, 39 putts, 25th place out of 60, I am okay with the results. A few final thoughts: This was my last tournament of the year, so I had no IJGA tournament rounds under 90 (Al McLean I shot 86). I am having a lesson with Dolph tomorrow before I head out to california to play some golf but more importantly relax at the beach. And the local rules sucked, calling OB a lateral hazard, allowing only two minutes to search for a ball, and calling stones in bunkers movable obstructions. Shame on them!

      I haven't been posting about all my rounds just 'cause, well I&nbsp;don't know. Motivation is becoming somewhat low (a lot of things are weighing on my mind), which is probably not such a good thing. I mean that's why I started my other blog. so i haven't been golfing so well and I just don't feel like talking about it. now i feel obligated to talk some, so I will. I have been on and off with my driver, and on friday I hit seven fairways, but two or three that I missed were good drives, just not in the fairway. I went 46-43 on friday for bogey golf 89 and missed every green on the course. Six par saves, 4 out of 4 for sandie chances salvaged a bad start and end of four doubles and a triple. I continue to struggle on the last three holes at winnetka, so I think I just need to make a plan for those holes to get bogies on them and get out alive. So I will. 16th Hole: I am a headcase with the driver on this hole, I just can't put the ball in the fairway. That isn't a good thought, of course, so I need to just think about the nice (thin) green patch out there in the middle. If I put my ball to the right as usual, I just need to pitch out to a short iron distance, put it on, and make bogey. If I have a good drive (It hasn't happened enough to know what a good plan would be but...) I should just take a bit of extra club or lay up or something, because if I miss the green on either side, that's not good. Right of sixteen green&nbsp;I have rarely gotten up and down from and left is in the water. It's a very big green, so (Insert conclusion here). 17th Hole: Three wood. Never driver. Maybe rescue mid if the conditions are good, but no driver. Just put it in front of the green if the three wood won't reach. Up and down for par is a good score for me here. Just a nice easy swing, even if I would need a hard one to reach the green. The green is very receptive to both sand shots and pitches, so no worries there. On the green just don't play too much break. 18th Hole: If the tees are up elevated, this may well not be a reachable par four with out a booming drive. play it safe then for the bogey. don't take the three wood off the fairway unless I gain more confidence with it off the deck (or at all). From down below I might have an iron into the green, so play for some roll (not too much) and do the best i can. The green is easier to chip onto when the pin is on the opposite side. A weird stance in the fairway might freak me out, so again, don't have to take the three wood. I have had a three iron roll over the green after landing in front of it, so maybe think about that play from 200 yards out. Its the last hole so I really need to keep my focus mentally. Okay I have to go to bed now, so good night all.

      I had another lesson with dolph yesterday up at willowhill. He had me doing some really great stuff with my swing, but I really need to get it ingrained into my muscle memory. I practiced a bit and played the last three holes at winnetka, mostly just messing around on them after putting at the nursery. Nonetheless, I need to be able to do these with no issue.

      I played eighteen holes today for the first time probably since the Chick evans. I shot much better on the back side than the front, which is good because it made up for the 46 with a 42 to round out to a okay 88. Saving par seven times was a definite boon, but the fact that they were my only pars was not good. five fairways and one green in reg do not a good score make. Thirty putts rocked, but four doubles and a triple don't. But hey, if this was a not so good day, I am getting better.

      I played nine holes using the new stuff from Dolph. It worked okay. I hit five fairways, four greens, but took 19 putts to shoot a 43. A triple (second shot duffed into the H2O) on five didn't help. But, bogeys and pars the rest of the way, so no trouble. I played with Ed and Peter. Ed won his first match out in mundelein, but lost the second, and Lucey lost his first. The same player beat both of them. I figure if I turn the triple into a bogey, and take three fewer putts, I shoot a very nice 38. Any way bye.

      I started a series of lessons with dolph at green to tee today. We did some introductory work, and talked with each other alot. I think I'm going to like him. He seems to A) know what he's doing B) have a plan and C) have experience. We'll see what'll happen...

      I shot a 97. Don't really want to talk about it much, which is ironic because, as a defense mechanism, I think, I talk way too much during a bad round of golf as a way of rationalizing the stress of poor performance. I started on the tenth tee today which was bad because I never had any idea how to play the tenth hole. So I just started by hitting my first drive OB. I never really recovered despite basically birdieing the hole with my second ball. A quad on the 18th right before the turn with two water balls hurt and made me turn in a 50 for the back side. I finally got something of a rhythm going on the second hole (my eleventh) after hitting a provisional for a lost ball but then finding it. The thing was that I just couldn't get the ball in the hole in par. I missed some fairways, but the fairways I did hit I missed the green on, or if I did in fact get a green (the fourth) I three putted. I missed a few short putts, but my putting total was lower, probably because instead of hitting the green but far from the pin, I miseed the green. The course was playing much tougher, I must say, because the tees were pretty much from the tips, and the wind was blasting hard. I really screwed up the par threes over water, doubling both. The eleventh I four putted from fifty feet above the hole (first putt long onto the fringe, second putter caught by rough, third missed, fourth tap-in), and the fifth I put my ball in the front bunker, took two shots to get out, and then two putted. It was very hot out there today, my shirt was wet and my hands too. One guy in my group fired a 78-73 to make it to the match play round of the tournament. He was one deep for the front nine, and had a chip in birdie to complement three bogeys on the back side. Props to a great course, great organization, two extra tournament rounds of golf, Ed Traines for firing a one over 72-73 to go to the match play portion probably seeded first. Anti Props (someone tell me the real word for these) for the bad greens, the lack of a driving range at the course, and the hot weather. PS My new two clubs are straightening out a bit

      Well, my tee time was at eight, and so I woke up at five, left at six, got there a bit before seven, hit range balls, putted, and teed off. There wasn't any range at the course, so we went to the course next door to hit balls. So then I started playing... I'll start with the big important summary, then go into details and analysis. I shot a 91, 45-46. So-so, I probably would have shot below 85 if I had played at winnetka (you'll see why). I had one birdie and three triples (ugh). The thing that really brought me down was my putting. I took 40 lousy putts. Actually, only 22 were lousy, because 18 went in, but... 8 three putts if you count putting from the fringe, Five of them I was on the green in reg. for. I took 22 putts on the nine holes on which I hit the green in regulation. my one birdie was on the 11th hole over water where I stuck a nine-iron to a foot. the greens were big, and my shots weren't going close to the pin, but still. I am still glad with my nine greens but my putting was atrocious. seven out of 14 fairways to go along with that, I was driving the ball pretty well. I lost two balls to the water hazards, one off the tee on the par five fourth, and one on a duck hook approaching the tenth green. I figure that if even I cut all my tripples to doubles, and make half of my three putts into two putts I would have a 84, which would not be bad at all. I figure that for my two oclock tee time tomorrow, I should leave at 12 oclock, hit a half bucket over at the other course (I warmed up really quickly this morning) and then go and putt a lot over at Steeple Chase. I got a ride hame from Ed Traines who shot an even 72 and should be in good position going into tomorrow to make it into the match play on wendesday. I went home, had lunch then cooled down at the pool. I really like Steeple Chase because its wide open and nicely done (except on the greens which were inconsistent). Tell more tommorow.

      I practiced after double bagging this morning for a while, then played nine holes at winnetka. I shot a 40 with 6 pars, a bogey, and two doubles. I made five of six up and downs around the green, all for pars. one green in reg on #7 for a par. I took 14 putts, three putting the ninth for a 6 after laying up after a mediocre drive. My other double was on five where I drove it into the water and then missed the sand save for bogey from the right trap. I had a good out, but the putt didn't go in. I also was in the sand in front of 8, with a downhill lie, and almost holed out for birdie (easy par, though). My bogey was on 4 with a short two putt. Hole: 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9 Score:4   5   3   5   6   4   3   4   6  40 Putts:1   1   1   2   2   1   2   1   3  14

      I just got new woods and was still trying them out today. A callaway big bertha three wood and a taylor made 19 degree rescue mid. Every shot I hit with the hybrid duck hooked, unless I meant it to do something like fade. In short, I am still getting used to them. My driver continued to be cold, until the fifteenth hole, which was my last, because rain was upon us. I finally remembered to stand closer to my ball and sent it 235 right down the middle of the fairway. Bogey golf in general, 90 if I had bogeyed the last three holes (a long shot). I was supposed to have a lesson with Jamie, but its still raining. It sure wasn't going to miss us. So I found out two things from the IJGA today. First, and more importantly, I was admitted into the chick evans junior amateur after being an alternate. So I get to play monday and tuesday next week! I also got a place in the palatine regional, so that's good. I think I'm pretty set on clubs for a while now, unless something breaks... Bye

      So today I shot another forty one on the back nine, equaling my score from yesterday, although the score was achieved in a slightly different way. Today, from tee to green I had five fairways, only one green in regulation, thirteen putts (no three putts) for a total of four pars and five bogies. To be exact, I actually had twelve putts (I was on the fringe on ten), but that was just a normal putt like any other. I again played the last three holes one over, only bogeying 17. I actually hit the fairway on 16! And the green! And I two putted for par! The stars must be aligned! My five one putts went towards three par saves and two bogey saves.I actually hit it into the forest preserve on 14 on my approach, but I dropped and got up and down to save bogey. I wish I could shoot 41 on the back every time. I can see where some par opportunities could be found if playing the last three holes in one over falls through. I bogeyed both par fives, and obviously they aren't too hard. Still, this just shows me that I  can  shoot a forty one on the back so long as I don't make too many doubles (yesterday was an extreme case). I really wish I was making more birdies, but by averaging only two greens per nine holes, its kinda hard to make a lot of them.

      I got back from golfing in california, played three complete rounds. I shot 83 and two 87's. I also tried to play a fourth round, but I was playing not so great, and the course made fivesomes, and it took over two and a half hours to play the front nine, so I quit after twelve and practiced on their putting green. Today I played eighteen, and shot a 84 at winnetka. There was a tournament so we had to start on the back nine. I had putted for about an hour, but I hadn't hit range balls at all, so I started double-double. However, I shot a 41 on the back, closing out with all pars, except on 17. Three par saves and no three putts gave a total of 15 putts, a figure which shows how good my putting was coming down the stretch. My chipping was horrendous, but making a few ten footers helped. The front nine started similarly, starting double-bogey, and there wasn't too much else of note on the side. Three pars, seventeen putts, a 43. Overall I wasn't driving the ball well at all, four fairways including a hundred yard duff on 11. I played 18 beautifully, and having the wind behind helped a lot. The tees were down, so from 410 I drove it to about 170, and with the wind behind and the pin very front, I took a seven iron into the green. This might be the only time I ever go driver-seven iron into eighteen. Plus I actually put it pin high and two putted for the easiest par I have ever had on that hole.

      So today around one my schedule conflict was successfully resolved, and so here's a summary of the results and a full schedule for me: I will be taking AP Latin 4 second period and will drop Cho-op, switching to Choraliers ninth period. US History, the class I previously had scheduled for that period, will be moved to my sixth period lunch slot (There was only one opening in that class, thank goodness I got in) and since lunch is moved to fourth my driver's ed is moved to eighth period. So while I will be unable to be in Cho-op (the class and the musical) I prioritized my Latin higher, especially since I may well major in Classics in college. So here's my new schedule. Feel free to make comments liberally about the whole issue if you so wish. &nbsp; EB- PCB Bio &nbsp; Advisory- Mr. Williamson &nbsp; 1st- AP English 3 &nbsp; 2nd- AP Latin 4 &nbsp; 3rd- Gym (outdoor ed/team block) &nbsp; 4th- Lunch (early, but okay since EB class starts at seven) &nbsp; 5th- Swing Choir &nbsp; 6th- AP US History &nbsp; 7th- MV Calc &nbsp; 8th- Driver's ed/free or vice versa &nbsp; 9th- Choraliers

      So today I was notified by Mr. Estberg that Cho-op conflicted with AP Latin 4. You know, those are probably my two most favorite classes in my schedule. The sad thing is that the registrar just was just lazy and wasn't using an optimal way to organize the schedules. Any way I have begun the string-pulling process. My dad suggested I list why I want to be in both classes so here goes: &nbsp; Why I want to be in Cho-op:   To continue my New Trier Choral Experience  To be in The Cho-op Musical  Because my mom was in Cho-op  To fulfill the requirement for Swing Choir of having another choir  To learn about American Musical Theatre (That's what the book says...)  I have friends in the class  To have taken every choir available to my by junior year (except Choraliers)   Why I want to be in AP Latin 4:   To continue my Classical Studies at New Trier  I may well at least start college majoring in Classics  To take the AP Latin-Vergil Exam  Because I have invested five years into learning latin already, and need a year complete my knowledge of Latin to a sufficient plateau.  So I can take AP Latin 5 next year  'Cause Vergil's Aeneid is a Classic, and reading part of it in the original Latin would be amazing  I have friends who take Latin  I rock at Latin (if I do say so myself) and while I my be very advanced for my years, I still find it one of my most challenging classes.   If you notice some amount of correlation, it is because I tried to do that.  So some options for me to resolve this schedule conflict are as follows:   Drop one or the other class (Very Undesirable, for Cho-op I would have to pick up another chorus to stay in swing choir, preferably Concert Choir)  Be allowed to participate in the Cho-op musical without being in the class and skirt the Swing Choir requirement.  Do some indepent study for Latin to continue as though I were in the class.  Take AP latin 5 before AP Latin 4 (AP-wise very viable, NTHS-wise, maybe not...)  Take nine level Latin 4 (Very undesirable, for then I would not be able to take AP latin 5)   Well dinner is now, so I have to go, but more on this later

      I woke up at 6:30 to go caddy, ate breakfast, etc. I went to Westmoreland around 7:30, but if turned out that there wouldn't be loops until eleven or something. I have a golf lesson (more about that later) at three, so that wouldn't work out I thought. So I came back home and made good use of my time. I rode up to Watts park on my bike on the Green Bay trail to play some disc golf. The ride was slow and hard because the wind was against me, but i finally got there and found watts park. I don't own any disc golf discs, so I played with a frisbee, which turned out to be much harder. I couldn't break bogey golf in both my nine hole rounds, but oh well its just my first time. I had issues with throwing the frisbee far enough, and the wind didn't help. Any way, I then rode into glencoe just to see what was up (not much) and came home, seriously considering having snack at panera in wilmette, but deciding against that. My choice paid off because I had cold leftover pizza (a personal fave)! I was loafing around the house when I realized that I hadn't played tennis in the longest time, so I went over to maple park with my dad and my sister and hit tennis balls around for 45 minutes. So now I am about to have lunch. This afternoon I will start taking golf lessons at tee to green at willowhill with a hourlong pre-assessment thingy. I think I also might start my summer reading (god forbid) this afternoon.

      An animal is one who can not control his or her environment. It is our id, or basic (animal-like) instinct, which subconsciously creates an environment for ourselves which is out of our control. This occurs only after we have tried to control our environment in a constructive way using our super ego (which ultimately may be the thing which defines us as humans). Thus, the fall of man.

      This is my first blog, and my first blog post. I was finding myself wanting to do so many things and having lots of great ideas, so I decided to use a blog instead of paper (it crumples too easily) or a whiteboard (I don't have one!). I will review my day sometimes, but mostly random ideas that I won't have to remember. If I don't make a post for a while, either I am way too busy to post but should to unload mental cargo, or I am not needing to put ideas in a place where I can come back to them because I can act on most of them immediately. My mind goes in cycles like that. I happen to be at a peak in mental productivity and am consumed by various commitments right now; that is why I started this blog. I have tried rigid calendars and to do lists before, but random thoughts just don't have a spot there. If I have any more random thoughts regarding the topic of my blog, I will randomly post them.

      We got a puppy today. It is a cocker-bichon: a cross between a cocker spaniel and a bichon frise. It's a nice dog and sits well in laps. On the ground it has a bit more energy, but not too much. I really like the coat it has, a nice tricolor, mostly black and white with brown eyebrows. Catherine named her sally tentatively. Goodnight (dad yelling at me)

      The top of my nalgene broke this summer, so I think I should get a new top for school. What happened was I looped it over my bike handle and the band that attached to the top of the cap, the part on the cap which held it in snapped off. Any way, if you have even the vaguest idea of what I just described that's great, since that was a horrible description.

      I really don't feel like spilling the beans about my trip to california. However, I will explain my title. My cousin allison was at My great uncle norm's pool and smelled uncle ken (her dad) fart. She said she could smell the coyotes, but then uncle ken admitted to farting. So another euphamism for farting has been coined.

      My dad's in the shower, so I think he's off my case for a bit now. I got my schedule in the mailing with all the courses for the bookstore. My schedule was as expected, and driver's ed resolved to second semester. I am so relieved. Of course, now my dad wants to buy all my books online but that was such a hassle last year that we just ended up buying them from the bookstore anyways. He seems tottally convinced that there is some new part to the process, but I am really balking. anyway, I hear him finishing his shower, gotta go.

      I just got back from california this evening, and I have a lot to catch up on, and my dad doesn't want me to stay up too late and so I will talk about my vacation in California tommorow. The thing is that it's only 8:30 california time so I don't see what the big deal is...
