       At first I was afraid, I was petrified, Kept thinkin’ I could nvr live without u by my side, But den I spent so many nights tinkin’ how u did me wrong, And I grew strong, and I learned how 2 get along,  And so u're back, frm outer space, I juz walked in 2 find you here wit dat look upon ur face, I should’ve changed dat  fuckin  lock, I should’ve made u leave your key, If I had known 4 just 1 second u’d b back 2 bother me,  Oh now go, walk out the door, Juz turn around now, cause u’re nt welcome nemore, Weren’t u the one hu tried 2 hurt me wit gudbye, Did u tink I’d crumble, did u tink I’d lay down and die  Oh no not I,  I will survive , Oh as long as I noe how 2 luv, I noe I’ll stay alive, I’ve got all my life 2 live; I’ve got all my luv 2 give, I’ll survive  It took all the strength I had nt 2 fall apart, Juz tryin hard 2 mend the pieces of my broken heart, And I spent so many nights juz feelin sorry 4 myself, I used 2 cry, but now I hold my head up high, And u see me, somebody new, I’m nt dat  stoopid lil' person  hu's still in luv wit u And so u felt lyk droppin’ in and just expect me 2 b free, Now I’m savin’ all my luv 4 some1 hu’s luvin’ me  Oh now go, walk out the door, Juz turn around now, cause u're nt welcome nemore, Weren’t u the 1 hu tried 2 break me wit gudbye, Did ya tink I’d crumble, did ya tink I’d lay down and die???
