        Here’s a quick one for you; it’s an opinion and some advice. Now, something we all do when we have a new relationship, normally on the first or second meeting is watch a film, I know its a bit of a wuss out option but we all do it, its easy and we don’t have to worry about making conversation etc etc, also it allows us to do other things if everything’s going well... you know what I’m saying lol. Yep, films are great alright, but when it comes to choosing the actual movie you are going to watch with her/him I think its a very precise art, and when you think about it there’s actually very specific criteria for you to make your choice with. Firstly, you want a comedy, this lightens the mood and makes everyone feel good, generally better about themselves, it also means that the two of you share some laughter, this is a very positive experience, and when you both find something funny it bonds you a little. Also, it will get you both smiling, everyone looks better when they are smiling. Next, and here’s the difficult part, you also want it to have some scary bits in there, this especially applies if your date is a girl, I’m not being sexist but if there’s a bit of gore or something slightly unpleasant her natural instinct is to lean into you for protection etc, we all know how great this is. Finally, the film just needs to be plain good quality, this shows that you have really good taste and can make good decisions etc etc. I think if you follow these rules the two of you will definitely be closer by the end of the movie, literally lol. There really is no better way to get closer to someone you like, and remember, the smaller the sofa the better and make sure its big and squishy. Anyway, bearing all of the above in mind, the best date movie I have found so far is.... The reasonably low budget Brit comedy 'Shaun of the Dead', its worked for me, ill let you read about it for yourselves:  urlLink http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365748/

        Well, I read today that the store Dixons is going to stop stocking the game Manhunt, this is because of a recent killing where a teenager wasted another teenager using very similar methods to those in the game, which if anyone doesn’t know features a guy who wanders around a deserted city killing everyone he meets in pretty nasty ways. In fact, I was one of the first people to buy this game, I got it on the day it was released, mostly because of its high quality parentage, Rockstar Games, those responsible for GTA, it is an incredibly good game and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but now fewer people can. Now, everyone thinks that the teenage killer was copying the game, and I’m not going to deny it, in fact it the details sound so much like the game that I’m almost certain that is what he was doing, but does that mean that the majority of people should no longer be able to enjoy it, I’m not one of those people that say games never affect anyone, but there’s maybe one in a billion people that actually acts based on these violent games, for the rest of us, the thought never enters our heads. I think this is really stupid of Dixons, its nothing more than a blatant attempt to win some kudos from the poor delusioned parents desperate to blame something for the fact that their son was essentially just the one weak guy in a sea of stronger people. The very people that now suffer because of it.  urlLink http://www.rockstargames.com/manhunt/

       I've been thinking about this recently, what makes us really happy with our life, what are the factors that make us think, my life is really going well, and by extension, what are the factors that make us happy, contented people. Because if i can figure out exactly what the things are that do this for me, I can at least try to work on them, now i dont know if they are the same for everyone, but here are mine, I think. Firstly, I need to have contact with other people, now this may seem obvious, but its a really important one, most people need to be sorrounded by a group of people who will activley try to seek out their company and genuinly like being with them,&nbsp; in other words, a good group of friends, im not just talking one or two, im talking a good sized group, essentially what im saying is i need to feel resonably popular. Secondly, I need to be busy, this may seem obvious to most people as well, but its not easy to see where to draw the line, busy can just mean that you have things to fill your days, that you dont wake up in the morning and struggle to think of a reason to get out of bed, you should always have&nbsp;a reason. I dont know if a hobby counts as this or not, for me a hobbies not essential, but im sure it might&nbsp;be for some people. This leads me to my next point, a job, I need to have a job, not only for practical reasons, like i need the money, but i also just think theres an inbuilt human instinct to want to work, somehow. Next, I need to be fit, this is why I go to the gym, I feel like crap if I dont exercise, this is a very important point, enough said. Lastly I think,&nbsp;and heres the most difficult on of all, I need to have a companion, a girl, this is really important, you need this kind of affection and you're not going to get it from anyone else, you need someone who likes you more than anyone else, someone to share things with etc. Now, heres my point I guess, when you've covered all but one or two of these issues, it throws the remaining ones into much sharper contrast, you can end up feeling terrible because you can see so clearly whats missing from your life. You can see what you need to be complete. This is the problem I am experiencing at the moment, but hey, at least I can identify my problems, my issue is that sometimes it seems impossible to rectify them, and this makes&nbsp;me even more depressed! Thats enough for today I think. P.s. Notice I havent included money or possesions on this list, these are important for a lot of people, including me, but I dont think they are as big as those listed above.

       These days a lot of our communicating is done over the internet or via text messaging. I as much as anyone use these services, and im very gratefull for them. They make talking to someone, especially someone you dont know, about a 100 times easier. I'm sure this is because you get a chance to think about what you are going to say before you say it, or because you don't have to look into that beautiful girls eyes while you try to come up with something witty to say. It helps a huge amount. The internet and text messages can make us more interesting, more funny etc to talk to. Now, the other thing about the internet is that you can talk with someone before you've ever seen them, this can easily present a problem when you do come to meet, which im sure i dont need to point out to you. You've built up a picture in you're head of this person and its easy to be disapointed, this seems obvious and thats why a lot of smart people dont like to go about making friends this way. The problem is when you have seen the person before, when you know exactly who they are in the flesh, and you start talking to them with your phone or the internet, things are going great, you have brilliant conversations and you both are getting on really well. You really think she's special, and so you want to meet her, you set it up, which isnt difficult considering how into you she is (because you're so clever and interesting remember) , anyway you meet up, and thats where it goes wrong. You've got nothing to talk about, there are uncomfortable silences and you could cut the air between the two of you with a knife.&nbsp; So whats happened? You were getting on brilliantly before, you told each other you loved the other, so why, now is noone talking. Whats happened? Well its obvious, you have been dulled by how easier faceless communication is, now hear you are having to think on your feet and neither of you can handle it, well this sucks, is she not the person you thought she was? Or will you become more comfortable with each other over time, I don't know the answer, and as you might of guessed this is a problem which is affecting me right now, it needs some thinking about.

       Everyone has friends right? But why? Now what I'm going to say isn't true for everyone I'm sure, although maybe on some level its true for most people. When I make friends its normally for a reason, I do it because I need something, think about it, what was the last friend you made? Now think about what led you to that person. Was it because you needed their influence, their money, their affection? Whatever, I would say that we make maybe 20% of our friends because we actually enjoy their company. The rest are functional, nothing more. This is why its very common to not actually like your friends all that much. So, here's my next point, what do we do when our friends reach the end of their usefulness? We get rid of them, we faze them out. There's no reason to keep someone around if they don't benefit you that much. Is this right? Am I the only person that thinks this way? And am I right in thinking this way? No, I think its the truth, there is always a reason. So, the question is, should I change, should I only make friends on the basis of actually enjoying their company, or should I continue to use people in order to make my life better, and lets not forget it works both ways, I've no doubt that I'm being used, is this the way it's meant to be?

       I'm a gym member, I'm fully paid up, it started with me just going once a week, this is fine I thought, I'm getting more healthy and I'm having fun, its a nice environment, what could be better? Then it started to happen, the gym started to suck me in, all of a sudden I couldn't stop going, I had to go more and more, and if I didn't go, even for a few days, I started to feel like shit, this is completely true, now I'm not saying the gym isn't really good for me, but its made my life a lot more difficult, now I've got to fit it in with everything else, and if I don't go I feel much worse than I did before I discovered it at all. So, I'm wondering what it is about this sort of exercise that gets us hooked, maybe its the whole ambiance of the place, because I play squash quite regularly also, and I don't feel any need to be there all the time, but the gym, well the gyms another matter, and if there is something about the gym that you get hooked on, is it good? I'm thinking maybe you just get hooked on the feeling of wellbeing you get afterwards, you know endorphines and all of that, so how about this, all gym users are drug addicts, I see them there, lying on the floor after doing 100 sit ups, high as kite from the endorphines, hell I'm one of them, I do it too, and it would be perfect, its completely safe and you look better afterwards, if only it wasn't so time consuming.

       Ok, I had to write about it eventualy so it may as well be sooner rather than later. Let me just say this, I have no problem with females, about half my best friends are females, so thats kewl, its only when you get onto the whole subject of relationships that things start to go wrong. Im talking about the mixed signals, the fact that you never, ever know whats going on. It really feels like you are trying to swim through treacle blindfolded. Case in point, recently I started to talk to this girl, apparently she had liked me for ages and ages and was crazy about me, so we meet up and everything goes well, this is great im thinking, its so simple and i know exactly whats going on. But NO, that isnt going to happen, about a week and a half passes and i dont hear from her. I give her a few calls but i cant get through to her. Finally she eventually does contact me, she says she lost my number, this is great im thinking, i know exactly whats going on, but NO! I ask her if she wants to meet up again, the response is muted and she keeps going on about the amount of work she is doing, finally she just stops texting me. A few days later and she texts again, she says she was out of credit, ok i think, this is fine, so i just ask her again if she wants to meet up, she says she is now working full time seven days a week, i suggest after work and there is no answer, this is where i am at right now. Why hasn't she answered me? And heres my point, this girl, according to everything ive been told by at least 3 friends (trustworthy ones) was absoloutly crazy about me, apparently she dumped her boyfriend  to be with me, so what the hell is going on? Have i done something wrong? Is she just messing me around? I need help!

       Well, im a teenager and im coming up to the point where i need to pick what subjects to study for A-levels. This is a problem, its not an easy choice in the first place, and its made worse by pretty much every person around me. Im talking specifically about teachers, parents etc. Now this isnt a new point but its worth repeating. At my age it is drummed into us that choices we make at this age will affect us for our whole lives, now i dont know whether this is true or not, i cant speak from experience, but im pretty damn sure that its not as important as they make it out to be, it adds a lot of stress to the preceedings. Which brings me to my second point, the rest of my life, what do i want to do with it? I used to think, and still do to some extent, that there wasnt much point living unless you made a difference, unless you changed the world, unless you won some victory for mankind, otherwise whats the point? This is a way of coping with the realisation that life is pointless, now thats not a huge reveleation, its something we all know but most of us choose to ignore, those of us that don't tend to go a bit crazy. So my most difficult question is this, do i go all out to try to make a difference (doctor, politician, scientist), to try to make my life a little less pointless, or do i just have fun , do i do what i really want to do (open a restauraunt), and just have a good time while it lasts, and then die knowing that my life was essentially a waste of time. Well thats what i used to think, but now im thinking maybe it wasn't a waste of time, maybe the point is to have fun (see my earlier post on drink). Whatever i choose, i need to make a decision now, or so my teachers tell me =).

       Ok, this is a subject that i've been thinking about for a while, and it's kind of become quite a large part of my life. I always used to be one of those people who said they would never drink. I was quite determined, but as with everything in life, when something really big changes get made, theres mostly nothing you can do about it. As i approached the end of the school, and began to faze it out in my mind, there was a space available, and thats where drinking came in, at first it was just a few now and then, but we started to have more parties etc and i started to drink more gradually, it really feels like something clicked, and my previous attitude suddenly seemed stupid, i reallised how much more fun it was being drunk than sipping along and remaining completly sober. I thought, why am i denying myself this. I guess i have drink to thank for forcing me to see the bigger picture. I began to think about my whole life and what my aims were. I began to think that i could do a lot worse that drinking, having a good time with friends, doing drugs now and again, and dying young, at least i would have had a good time. And in the end isnt that the point, i became a firm believer that this was all there was to life, you can get a good career, and try to change the world if you want to, and if you manage it thats a huge bonus! But really, you're only really living when you are on the edge, partying, drinking, pushing yourself, in short widening your perspective by becoming something that you aren't normally, and of course having fun. And who wants to live till they are 60 anyway, you can't do anything good, you're outdated and useless. So I begun to drink more and more, and i was fine, nothing bad happened and I was finally living, at least i thought i was. I still drink a lot now, but im starting to think about it again, its like my old logical mind is arguing with my new ideas. I also cant shake the feeling that drink seems best when im down anyway. I keep thinking that all it really is is a way of escaping, a method of distancing myself form the real world. I know this is the most popular view. And afterall, i've spent my life so far trying out ways of distancing myslelf, but more on that another time. So now im not sure what to do, ill keep you posted.

       Ok, here we go, the first proper entry and i thought i would say a bit about myself, i am 16 years old, there, thats it, thats all you need to know. You're probably thinking that as a teenager my problems are trivial and unimportant, and you may be right, but goddamit im gonna write about them anyway, and maybe ill tell you some more about myself as I go along. Ok, im not particularly happy right now, and there are a couple of reasons. Lets make a start. Firstly there's my job. I work in Woolworths, im sure most people know what that is, its a shop that makes most of its money selling colourfull plastic crap to children. Oh, and lottery tickets. I work on a till mainly, thats the standard job for someone my age. This means I get to sell the lottery tickets, the amount people buy amazes me, i know the money goes to good causes and everything but when you think about it its still an awfull lot of gambling, not that theres anyhting wrong with that but ive never agreed with it. I just dont see why you should give someone else your money, maybe its the scottish in me. Anyway, my main problem with Woolworths is the way then handle overtime, I signed up for a saturday job, that means saturday only, but as soon as they found out that i had finished school for the year they start to give me more hours, now we're not talking a few here, we're talking the whole damn week, they want me to work full time! But heres the real bitch, they have a board they post the hours on, what happens is, next to every employee the write the hours for each day, and you're expected to do them, there's no query first, you just do them, and if you actually get up the nerve to go and tell the manager you can't do a day, you get dirty looks for a least a week. So im stuck, these guys are taking away my holiday, and theres not much i can do about it, especially as im one of those people who cant say no to anyone. I don't know what to do, and this isnt the only problem long hours are causing me, but thats for another post. I hope the above made sense.

       Well, heres the first post for the new blog, im still not sure about the design but i guess i can always change that later. Anyway, I guess i should do a small introduction first, because you deserve to know what you are getting into by reading this. Basically, im just going to use it as a kind of diary, but with some more interesting things thrown in as well. Im doing it because i thought it might be a good way to relive some stress (because sharing is healthy), and i could use some stress relief about now (but more on that later). If you are wondering whether this blog is just going to be me moaning about my life then allow me to set your mind at ease... that is exactly what it is going to be. If you dont like the sound of that you dont have to read any furthur, but if you could do with a laugh and think reading about someone elses misfortunes would cheer you up, then please read on. Thats about it for the first post, but ill get back to you soon. P.S I appologise in advance for my terrible spelling and grammer.

        Ive recently had a change of opinion on a very important topic, I’m sure everyone can guess what it is, that’s right, ive been trying to decide which is my favourite decade, very important I know you'll agree. All of them has something different to offer, something good about them, well, maybe not the 90s haha, except if you're into boy bands and tracksuits that is. Anyway, previously I would have always said the 80s, I was born then but that’s not the reason, there was just something about the hedonistic flashiness that really appealed to me, the bright lights and even brighter clothes, I think that the 80s represented the very peak of the huge ego trip that had been building for some time, as with most things this was strongest in America and spread from there. In the 80s people were just enjoying everything that they had created for themselves up to that point, and it drove them a bit mad. The 20s were similar to a slightly lesser extent, they represented another peak. After these decades things begin to decline a bit, as though people realised how crazy things had gotten and started to feel a bit self conscious, therefore they throttled down a bit, resulting in the uncertain awkwardness of the 90s. Where things were just a bit too quiet and plain. I like these peak decades a lot, as I already mentioned, especially the pastel suits and music of the 80s, there was something about this pop and new rave that was so lame it became kind of cool to me. However recently I’ve started to think that more interesting were the build up to these times, it is with these decades, specifically the 60s and 70s that we can really see how our society moved and evolved, there’s a lot we can learn from our actions at these times, lessons which have to some extent been lost or dulled over time as we revert to our old ways again, however I guess that’s inevitable, if we follow the pattern we have for the last 80 years or so, I refer to the decline and fall I describe above, with society reaching its peak and reverting again, from history we can see that the most important things that changed during these times were our actual attitudes towards a lot of things but most importantly towards life itself. It is these attitudes which interest me some much in the 60s and 70s, it seems that the predominant feeling during these middle decades, when we try to find ourselves and do most of our questioning of our values etc is one of total indifference, a wonderful disregard for the system that has brought us this far, a yearning for change, a wish just to enjoy life, an openness towards everything. It is this mindset that I am in love with. It is this mindset that brought about the birth of the greatest music ever, rock, and specifically my hero Jimi Hendrix. It is through the drug haze that more greatness than has ever been seen before came. I refer to the hippie set and the summer of love, but more widely I refer to most people at that time, who in some way experienced society changing. In fact it has been suggested that the freethinking individuals of the 60s/70s directly led to the yuppieism of the 80s, this may explain why they both hold a special place in my heart. Anyway, I put it to you that 1965 - 1975 were the greatest years that man has ever known; there’s nothing more to say. Damn, I really was born at the wrong time.
