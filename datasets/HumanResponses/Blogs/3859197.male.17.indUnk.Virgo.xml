      Today was great until.....  I visited Danny's Guest Book where I had previously left a post that unintentionally insulted someone that I though of as a friend.  Unfortunately they responded back with an unpleasant message about how they hate me.  As far as them hating me I can care less but revealing it in such a public way is another thing.  Well I responded with an apology and tried to clear things up hopefully they'll respond by dropping the subject forever.

      Yey!  I finished American Literature in Adult School.  The first of three classes I have to make up.  Hopefully I'll get started on English Composition tomorrow and finish in two weeks.  That's my goal.

      I just got home from hanging out and damn it's late.  My brother finally came home from the hospital.  I'm glad he's home but he already got on my nerves. Well, not really.  He showed me the scar on his leg and told me about the whole operation.  He also told me about he actually watched the news because there were no cartoons on at 11:00 pm (he's useto cartoon network) .  We (Me, Toro, Robert and Chris) went to see The Bourne Supremacy and I have to say it was preety cool.  Matt Damon's character "Bourne" or should I say Daniel, yeah well him, he's fuckin' crazy.  I never seen part one and it really doesn't matter.  The second part stands on its own.  It starts out slow but then picks up with that one part (if you saw the movie then you know what I mean).  The funniest thing of the day is when we were kicking it at Chris' house.  We saw the famous Huntington Park hookers.  Man are they uuuuuuugly.  I still haven't seen Spiderman 2 though.  I know it's awesome because everyone tells me it was but I just haven't gotten the opportunity to see it, or to be straight to the point I don't have a god damn car to drive my ass over to the theatre.  Oh well, someday I will.

      WHOA!  I haven't written in almost a week.    Well, I finally got to see I, Robot and I have to say it was a kick ass movie.  I saw with Toro and Maya then we went to grab some chineese food at the spot.  Damn that food is good.  My brother is still in the hospital unfortunately.  I'm hoping he gets home soon.  Even though he gets on my nerves sometimes, there's this brotherly bond deep down inside us or at least deep down inside me, that, that, that...

      My brother is still in the hospital!  He told me about the operation and how he got anaesthesia.  He'll most likely be there a couple of days.  Brandy said I look like a duck, not any ordinary duck, Baby Huey.  Do I ?

      I just got back from Jessica's Birthday Party.  [If you're reading this, thank you Jessica, it was a good time.  The food was scrumdiddlyumtious, sorry I didn't try the potato salad you made.]  Man oh man, my brother fell and hurt his leg.  He was bleeding internally and his leg swelled up.  We took him to the hospital and is getting it treated.  Hopefully he'll be home by tomorrow.  I think it's a good memorable experience though.  I remember my childhood injuries.  Like when I got bit by a dog in the buttcheek or when some kid threw a metal car at my face, causing it to split open or when I fell down the stairs of the second floor apartments we lived in.  Yeah they're all good. I had a BUNCHA of them.  Ha, buncha.

      I went to Adult School, again.  It sucked, again.  I was very sleepy today though and really wanted to go home.  I think it's because I'm typing this damn blog at midnight.  At least there's no school tomorrow, whoopy.  Too sleepy me no write more.

      Why didn't I go to adult school today?  Oh well I must have been lazy.  Hopefully Mr. Hernandez doesn't get the impression that I don't want to be here and drop me.  I saw the  urlLink Assistant , the new  urlLink Andy Dick  reality show and I have to admit it made me laugh more than once.  So I'll be watching that show in its entirety.  They already iliminated two people in the first show.  I've had contact with Cira (Hello Cira) who told me she's at Oxy.  Not this  urlLink Oxy , this  urlLink Oxy .  She looks like she's having fun. ;)

      I didn't post yesterday because I locked up my Hardrive.  Stupid me.  I've been trying to fix it but my friend had my Mac OS X cd.  So I went to go pick it up today.  So I fixed my computer and it's back to its original perfect mac running ways.  Has anyone seen the trailer for the upcoming movie  urlLink Saw ?  It looks like it's going to be a cool movie.  If you like movies check it out you might just want to see it after viewing the disturbing trailers.  I do.   urlLink  Trailer 1 (Quicktime)   urlLink  Trailer 1 (Windows Media Player)    urlLink  Trailer 2 (Windows Media Player)

      Well I saw a lot of people at The Twins graduation luau.  I just want to thank The Twins even though it had to end sooner than it was meant to, due to some violent activity or rather bitchy neighboors that complained to the police.  The jaiba was delicious, yummy.  After the party I rolled with Gabriel and Enrique to El Gavillan.  Charlie, DK, Karilo, Jessica, Virginia and Cathy went too.  Oh yeah Jeffrey and Vanessa went to but...... nevermind.  On our way there we found Alex at  urlLink Tommy's  and Gabriel yelled out, "Shorty!"  She didn't hear though.  Gabriel then was worried about Roger shanking him.  Well that was it we ate and talked and then  it was of to La Casa at least for Enrique, Gabriel and I.  I don't know what the rest of them did afterwards.  On another note, I can't wait 'till July 16th to go see  urlLink I, Robot .  It looks like it's going to be a cool movie.  For  those of you out there that can't wait either I found these clips.     urlLink Clip 1-It Would Be Better Not To Die    urlLink Clip 2-You Are Experiencing A Car Accident    urlLink Clip 3-What Am I ?

      Ha.  Brandy (Hello Brandy) apologized for calling me a jerk today.  I went to Adult School again.  It sucked again.  Karilo was there and we left at the same time so we were walking together.  How gay huh.  On our way home we found Gabriel (What's up Gabe) and Jeffrey ( What's up Jeff).  So we kicked it and talked for a while about how we're lame if we go to the Aloha Dance and how we need cars.  A bunch of other shit too but l forgot what, something about Danny (What's up Danny) being gay.  Anyways, we then went to Laki's to grab a bite to eat, we was hungrys.  Gabriel wanted to go to La Quebrada but they have a C and Laki's has an A.  Laki's gets my money.  Damn the twins luau is Saturday and I don't have luaue clothes.  I need to go shoping.  Maybe ill braid my hair too.

      My brother left to Mexico today and took my  urlLink iPod .  I'll miss it on my lonely walks.  He also took the digital  urlLink camera .  Now I can't take nice preety pictures of stuff.  He also took the video camera so now I can't take nice preety video of stuff.  He took all the god damn fun gadgety stuff we have.  What a punk.    I went to Adult School. again.  It was boring, again.    When I arrived at my casa I called my friend Jessica (Hello Jessica) to see if I could go pick up my yearbook and can you believe it, she was home. So, I finally got my yearbook.  Then dumb Brandy (Hello Brandy) got mad because she thought I called her a poser.  One who pretends to be someone they're not.  When in reality I meant one that poses for the camera.  She called me a jerk and a bitch. How dare she!  She better apologize.  Finally I found the funniest  urlLink Link

      I began Adult School today in hopes of getting my Diploma.  Adult School sucks.  I found some friends there so I know i'm not alone.  Hopefully i'll finish quick and get the hell out of there so I can do other things.  I also tried to get my yearbook back from a friend but she didn't answer her phone.  Let's hope she's there tomorrow.

      Work today was horrible.  I was out on the sun all day.  My arms and face turned bloody red and hurt like a mutha.  My whole body was hurting, in nedd of a massage.  Then the buddies invited me to see  urlLink Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle .  I originally didn't want to go since I was feeling like shit but they eventually convinced me.  Good thing they did because the movie was hilarious.  It had me laughing a lot.  The funniest part was the fact that Kumar looks exactly like Robert.  Evertime I saw him I starting laughing uncontrolably

      I hate potato bugs!  They make me do that funny gross out dance people do when they're grossed out.  No, not  urlLink this one   So, I was doing some yardwork today, when I came upon one of  urlLink these guys .  A Jerusalem Cricket also known by us spanish speaking people as a  urlLink niño de la tierra .  Naturally, I jump like a bitch and scream, "Holly muthafucken shit." Then, I think to myself, "This is a crazy looking bug, I should get a closer look at it."  I begin to kneel and lean forward but stop and think, "This thing can jump towards me and bite my eye causing permanent blindness and we don't want that do we."  I dont. So, I grab a nearby stick and give it a good wack, alright it's paralyzed.  Now I really get a close look at it and  urlLink this  is what it looked like.

      All I Want Is You  U2  You say you want Diamonds on a ring of gold You say you want Your story to remain untold  But all the promises we make From the cradle to the grave When all I want is you  You say you’ll give me A highway with no one on it Treasure just to look upon it All the riches in the night  You say you’ll give me Eyes in a moon of blindness A river in a time of dryness A harbour in the tempest But all the promises we make From the cradle to the grave When all I want is you  You say you want Your love to work out right To last with me through the night  You say you want Diamonds on a ring of gold Your story to remain untold Your love not to grow cold  All the promises we break From the cradle to the grave When all I want is you  You...all I want is... You...all I want is... You...all I want is... You...
