      (no title) Glass bottles clank against your bedroom door masking the sound of fists against the floor. Last night was calm and cool as we whispered the secrets of old and lonely fools. Conversation sailed deeper and our words began to slur into the night. I could tell it’d been a long time since you’d given up yourself. We sloshed and threw back cold ones by the pack. We tossed one and talked some but talked more than we drank. We laughed to soothe our stories and skipped rocks across the deck. Then I threw a bottle at your door and you drummed your fists against the floor and we wrote a lullaby for us.  perfect You have a knack for collecting perfect things, from the perfect plastic people in your room to your perfect dreams. And the way you walk around you make perfect look so easy but there’s gotta be a struggle in your step. And the way you laugh you make perfect look almost tangible but there’s something about your smile that’s not quite right. Maybe it’s all this perfect you’ve got in you starting to wear you away. Well, I’ve always wanted to sit with someone better. So if you’d like we could explore your imperfections together.  We’ll tear your perfect pictures apart and toss chaos around your room. We’ll empty a corner where you can breathe.  all work copyright © smokeycustard

      gee wilikers, long time no see...or write.  not much has happened. the only thing i can think of blog worthy would be my uncles 50th birthday party. IT WAS AWESOME. the party started at 10pm (im totally serious) and we all ended up leaving around 4:30am. what made it the awesome shin-dig that it was happened to be my two friends from CT, courtney and bridget, who came down for the event. we decorated, we ate, we drank, we tried watching dvd's, and we killed a slug with salt on the porch...very very good time. my most memorable night of the summer so far. then bridget stayed for a week and we got to hang out then too. it was pretty sick. i've been BEGGING the parental unit for a new computer and i finally got my wish! there were some terms tho...i have to start prepping for the SAT this summer and through my sophmore year (basically until i take the test). i think it's ridiculous but hey, if it gets me my new comp im in. apart from that not much is going on...i'm not writing as much as i was before, maybe i lost my inspiration? who knows. hopefully i'll be back on the map soon!   sarah a.k.a smokeycustard

      the art of writing is not easy, but what's easy in life? well...some things are and other arent, and this isnt! it requires concentration and inspiration, two qualities i do not possess. with that said, i have not written anything since i last posted but have instead been turning over lines in my head. that has to be worth something, right? so, here are my unfinished thoughts for your reading and viewing pleasures.   Yea, we love the adrenalin in saying goodbye and the rush we get while we tell ourselves “you’re not going to cry,” So when they ask us if were okay we say “were just fine,” is fine supposed to look like this?  There was a time I couldn’t stand not knowing who I am, but that times passed and I’ve decided I’m better off believing the worlds all flat, than trying to explore every curve.   yes, i know:i suck. but im trying! :)  all work © smokeycustard

      took a chance. may regret that chance i took. left the order of scheduled life behind and encompassed myself in chaos and uncertainty. i feel great. scared, but amazing nonetheless. put it all on the line and hoping i come out on top, thats living right?

      cheers and bottoms up! here's the edited version of lc...  lc (edited) Well, the summer days are longer and maybe it’s the heat that’s been making my mind wander off, a little at a time. I’ve been going back to the first nights, and the big fights and those quality quiet times when it was just you and me. and I like to explore the good days and the bad, when we knew we had a face across the hall or a number we could call if the worst that could happen did. And yea, some words got thrown around and we got off cue every once in awhile but damn, we had some fun times. You and I doubled over, laughing and kicking, instead of doing our homework at least twice a week.  And we all cried by moonlight and you messed up a few lines and we walked the quad a few times, just to clear our heads. so, summer will fix everything we let slip. So, fall will come with suitcases and blank pages and newly built bridges to cross. it won’t matter how we left or if we said perfect goodbyes, even if we said goodbye at all. We’ll be back again.  all work © smokeycustard

      yessssssss, definetly was convinced i had writers block, but i wrote so i guess i dont. (why cant i rhyme when i write!?)i wrote this about 3minutes ago and am extremely psyched about it.  here she is. cheers and bottoms up!  summer nights part 1 (i have a feeling i'll write something else like it) Well, out on my porch it’s a whole other world of charming guys and dancing girls. It’s another way of life on this side of town, sipping lemonade in laid back lawn chairs just as the sun goes down. Then we turn up the radio and some guy kicks up the band and we grab a hand and spin, cause life’s so fast like that. and we fill the night with laughter for everyone who can’t and try to think how there’s so much more to life. But for now it’s just warm summer nights and a couple dozen pitchers of lemonade with a beat up radio on the side, cause for now that’s all we need to get us by.  all work  © smokeycustard

      I don't really know how to intrododuce myself. But I'm rellish.I have been thinking about what i should write for a couple of days so i figured i would just say this: I never know what to say. I guess I have a lot to say just its premature;in other words it can't be put into words yet. But just you wait, I'll be back.          "Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."                                                    until next time...

      driftwood Well, bind me down to a piece of driftwood and toss me where you will. Tie to me a heartfelt letter with every feeling you’ve ever felt. I’m heading toward calmer weather, I wish you’d join my cause. Cause it’s all for the better…Well, we managed to act out another successful goodbye and you’re getting better at it every time. But I’ll be back…cause goodbyes are often better than they seem and all the good parts are in the tiny in betweens. I’ll make it back to you, I swear.   -i rewrote that maybe 3 times...i just wanted to use two of the lines and built around it.   sightseer There’s something about driving down the winding asphalt that reminds me of you. All the potholes and small bumps, then the smooth plains you’d wish would last forever. And when your drives finished and your tanks gone empty you always say “that was the best drive of my life,” some of the sights were terrible and others were flawed but the ones that kept me, kept me in awe. The saddest thing though is that there’s no way to get back to them, and the prettiest parts last for seconds. But in the end it’s all worth it. In the end you were the best trip i took this summer.  -wrote this one pretty quickly. under 10minutes i believe. i like it tho. it's...interesting.  all work copyright © smokeycustard

      Evan  I need you but I’m too afraid to say it, you’re the best thing I’ve got going but I get scared someone will try to take it. I'd tell you but the words get tangled up, you’re right in front of me but you still feel too far to touch. I see you falling and I’d die to pick you up but sometimes dieing just isn’t enough. the rush is soothing and I’m starting to drown, the worlds getting grayer and I’m getting down. It never ends like this on the big screen, they always make up in the last scene. but you’re happy so I’ll sleep sweet dreams tonight. It’s all I ever wanted.  all work © smokeycustard
