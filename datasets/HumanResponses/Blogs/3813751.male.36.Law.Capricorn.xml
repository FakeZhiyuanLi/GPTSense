      I sent the flowers on Friday, and as of today I have yet to receive a thank-you e-mail from MJ.&nbsp; I called the hotel and they assured me that the flowers were placed in her room, but thus far I haven't heard a thing from her about them.&nbsp; And I don't want to call to ask if she received them because, frankly, I'm concerned that that would sound pathetic. &nbsp; Whatever is up, the waiting is driving me nuts. &nbsp; I told my father about it.&nbsp; He thinks she's still trying to process the data and figure out an appropriate response.&nbsp; He believes that hearing nothing is significant.&nbsp; In his mind, the response very likely  was  positive and now she's trying to figure out how to backtrack from a stated intractable position. &nbsp; Yeah, or (here I go, ever the pessimist) she's trying to figure out a way to get me to stop doing these things without sounding like a complete, ungrateful&nbsp;bitch. &nbsp; I don't know what's up.&nbsp; I really don't.&nbsp; I keep thinking that she might have gone with somebody, though I believe that to be completely ridiculous.&nbsp; If she had, she would not have taken the boys with her.&nbsp; But when I spoke with D on the phone Sunday night (and no, I did not ask whether or not MJ liked the flowers), and he wasn't exactly forthcoming with the details of his trip. &nbsp; The truth is, I'm tired.&nbsp; I've been trying to win her back for&nbsp;almost a month now, and I've received no sign from her that a dialogue can even be opened.&nbsp; I'm beginning to think that the whole situation is hopeless, and that I probably should let it go.&nbsp; It would be easier than having my heart broken every day for a month, or once a month for the past eleven.&nbsp; My I Ching reading didn't help matters.&nbsp; To the question, "Does MJ want to stay married to me?" I received this response: &nbsp;  The present is embodied in  Hexagram 44 - Kou (Coming to Meet):  We see a female who is bold and strong. It will not be good to marry such a female.  &nbsp; Pretty devastating, I think.&nbsp; And I am seriously considering just hanging things up for good.

      MJ is taking the boys to&nbsp; Niagra Falls this weekend.&nbsp; I did some detective work and found out where she was staying.&nbsp; I am considering sending her flowers, something that has pissed her off before but which I would like to do anyway.&nbsp; I have no idea what her reaction would be, so I called C to ask what he thought.&nbsp; His response was, "Give it a shot, what will it hurt."&nbsp; Not the most ringing endorsement, of course, but he's agreed that I ought to try, especially since it's been two weeks since I last tried this and was by MJ to stop.&nbsp; So, not sure whether or not I should do it, I consulted my I Ching.&nbsp; This was the result: &nbsp;  Should I send roses to MJ's hotel room today?  The present is embodied in  Hexagram 61 - Chung Fu (Inner Truth):  Inner truth moves even pigs and fish, and leads to good fortune. There will be advantage in crossing the great stream. There will be advantage in being firm and correct.   The third line, divided, shows its subject having met with his mate. Now he beats his drum, and now he leaves off. Now he weeps, and now he sings.   The situation is evolving slowly, and Yang (the active masculine force) is gaining ground. &nbsp; The future is embodied in  Hexagram 9 - Hsiao Ch'u (The Taming Power of the Small):  There will be progress and success. We see dense clouds, but no rain coming from our borders in the west.  &nbsp; So that settles it.&nbsp; I'm sending the flowers.&nbsp; Wish me luck.

      I feel like my attempts are hopeless.&nbsp; The roses I sent in June had as much effect as an ant in a life-or-death struggle with a wolf.&nbsp; The poems I sent to her, to the best of my knowledge, remain unread and, for all I know, decorated her trash can upon receipt.&nbsp; I've given up proclaiming  any  love for her.&nbsp; I know she's going to Niagra Falls with the boys, and while she hasn't said so -- it's certainly none of my business, in her opinion -- I cannot help but feel that she's going with a friend of her own. &nbsp; And yet, very limited progress has been made, I suppose.&nbsp; I talked to her brother C about the subject of my car -- he has a mechanic working on it -- and the subject of MJ came up.&nbsp; I asked if he had heard anything about the two of us, and he said, "Well, yes," with some playfulness in his voice.&nbsp; He talked to her the other day, he told me, and she told him about my attempts to win her back--the flowers, the telephone calls, and her insistence in that it was over.&nbsp; She informed him that a lot of the problems had been brewing for a while and that things had reached a breaking point with A.&nbsp; C asked her point blank if we were divorcing.&nbsp; She had said before that it was absolutely over, using such words as "it's over," "we're done," "we're through," "I cannot go back," "I do not love him anymore."&nbsp; This time, however, she said, " I don't know ."&nbsp; C seemed to think that was progress because at least it was not a flat-out "no."&nbsp;&nbsp;"One month ago she was saying 'no, no, no, absolutely not, it's over,'" he said,&nbsp;"and now she's at least thinking about it.&nbsp; Give her time."&nbsp; I told C that if she said, "I love you, I still want to be married, come on up," I would be off in a second.&nbsp; "That's not going to happen," he said.&nbsp; "At least, not now.&nbsp; Give her time.&nbsp; Let things run their course." &nbsp; It's funny.&nbsp; Two days ago I was just trying to deal with the fact that it is over and done.&nbsp; I was trying to move on, and convinced myself I could do so.&nbsp; Now I'm hearing that that might not in fact be the case. &nbsp; In addition, I had a conversation with her about her job.&nbsp; She went up north for a promotion that looks less and less likely as time goes by.&nbsp; She said that if she does not get it she will be moving back home fairly quickly.&nbsp; Then she told me that he had a call from a pharmaceutical company in Florida that saw her resume and wants to talk to her.&nbsp; She said it's located in Orlando, and that if they make her a serious offer she would consider moving there.&nbsp; "You could live there too," she said.&nbsp; "It's a Bush state, so it wouldn't be all that different for you."&nbsp; Well, she's right, I  could  move there, if only to be closer to my boys, but I do not think it's fair for me to have to consider uprooting myself if we do not stand a chance. &nbsp; I'm beginning feel likeI'm a yo-yo with a threadbare string.&nbsp; I simply have a hard time dealing with this up and down. &nbsp; The truth, too, is that I'm tired of putting my life on hold for her.&nbsp; Simply put, she has no idea what she wants.&nbsp; At all.&nbsp; I personally think she's flitting between one thing and another because she doesn't have any real rudder.&nbsp; I want to tell her to call me when she has figured out what she wants, but not to expect me to keep waiting.&nbsp; That, of course, will not happen.&nbsp; She'll figure out what she wants, of course, she just doesn't want me in the picture. &nbsp; An I Ching reading I took doesn't offer much hope. &nbsp;   Will MJ and I be together again?    The present is embodied in Hexagram 37 - Chia Jen (The Family): For the regulation of the family, what is most advantageous is that the wife be firm and correct.   There are no changing lines, and hence the situation is expected to remain the same in the immediate future.  &nbsp; I'll be  so  glad when things are a little clearer with her. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      More than anything, I want to return to my family.  I know that the reason MJ want to leave is because of the affair.  But now I feel like she's not exactly forthcoming with what she has been doing during her business trips, or at least is looking for a way out and using the affair as an excuse.  Here's the deal:  A couple of weeks ago I became truly despondent and opened her e-mail for clues just to see how I could I could win her back.  I found an e-mail sent to a friend of hers that was titled simply "the guy," and read her what she wrote.   There is nothing to play...He is in a committed relationship.   I was just not expecting to see him, that's all.  The spark was not really there anymore, it was more of a surprise than anything.....Anyway, he's gone.  He was only here this week and left yesterday.   Again, I'm faced by a dilemma.  What do i do with this information?  Do I confront her with it, thus closing  any  door to saving my marriage?  Do I simply ask her about it?  (She told me that she had  never  been unfaithful, in both of her trips to Canada, yet this letter certainly plants doubt in my mind.)  Or do I let it go?  Fuck.  Why can't life have something resembling a road map?

      Interesting reading from an online  I Ching .  I asked the question, "Does MJ still want to be married?" and got this result.   The present is embodied in Hexagram 40 - Hsieh (Deliverance): Advantage will be found in the southwest. If no further operations are called for, there will be good fortune in returning to the old conditions. If some operations are called for, there will be good fortune in the early conduct of them.   The first (bottommost) line, divided, shows that its subject will commit no error.   The third line, divided, shows a porter with his burden, yet riding in a carriage. He will only tempt robbers to attack him. However firm and correct he may try to be, there will be cause for regret.   The situation is shifting, and Yang (the active masculine force) is gaining ground.   The future is embodied in Hexagram 34 - Ta Chuang (The Power of the Great): It will be advantageous to be firm and correct.    I really do not put much stock in any kind of spiritualism, yet the  I Ching  seems to be the best resource I've found for any kind of guidance in my life.  In this case, what I'm told seems pretty clear:  as long as I maintain a steady course, and do not try to force any issue, then I have a pretty good chance of saving my marriage and my family.  Let's hope I'm not misreading anything.

      D went to Canada on Sunday.  It was a fairly emotional day for me, with me trying to be brave and D looking very somber.  As I sat with him at the gate awaiting the boarding call he asked if MJ and I were getting a divorce.  I told him, honestly, that I did not know.  I didn't know whether or not MJ's statements that she no longer loved me were a bluff or were just a shield of anger, but whatever it is, I really do not think it matters much anymore.  I have to tell myself that what she says, while it might be just a reaction to two months or more of hurt, could very well be true.  I think that and try to cry, but the tears do not come.  I don't think I have any tears left, frankly.  After D boarded the plane I called MJ who was on her way to Detroit with her "friend" Chris to let her know.  She asked if I was okay, and I snapped, "Don't ask me that."  She then cut off the call immediately with an, "Okay, I'm sorry, bye," and hung up.  When she called later that evening she told me about the trek over the Canadian border, and that they made it okay.  It was a twenty-minute conversation that, from what I can tell, ended civilly, and gave me a sense of hope that we might, just  might , work out.  I'd like it to, but I have to be realistic.  We'll see.

      D goes to Canada on Sunday to be with his mother.  Needless to say, I am not happy about this.  I don't want to see him go.  I love his companionship and his smile, and he has brought great joy to my life, as has his brother S.  To have him be gone for me, even for only a couple of months, is going to leave a huge hole in my heart.  I have to look at this as a challenge and not a complete dismissal, but that is going to be very difficult.  I love both of my boys, and my wife, so much, and I cannot believe how foolish I was to let all of this go.  I do not want to let it go.  I want to be whole again, and they helped make me whole.

      MJ called last night to talk to D (who goes to Canada to live with her for the next few months) then talked to me for a little bit.  She was tired--she took S to watch the Canada Day fireworks with her--and yawned quite a bit.  She had gotten off of work late as well, so felt pretty drained.  All told the conversation was fairly spirited and cordial.  She also asked me to pick up some eye pencils from Ulta and send them along with D.  I told her I'd be happy to do it, and declined her offer of money for doing so.  We spoke of the fact that we had twelve good years, but I did not press the issue of reconciliation.  All I told her was that my door and my heart will always be open for her, and she said the same, though she told me not to read anything into that.  She did ask if I had talked with A since I broke off the affair.  I told her that I had received a few e-mails merely asking why, but that my response was still the same: I was still very deeply in love with my wife, and as long as I was (which will be forever) I could not be involved with anybody else because, quite frankly, that would not be fair to anybody, not me, not her, and certainly not MJ.  MJ agreed that that was right, then got a small dig in.  "You know, not to sound mean," she said, "but she should have know better than to get involved with a married man."  Well, damned if she isn't right on that score.  It was good to talk to MJ again, even if we couldn't speak of staying married.  It's a shame, because I still want to be married to her.  God, I hate this.

      This is a sonnet I wrote for MJ.  I have not had the courage to send it to her.    Moments     I think of you, the moments that we share Since Cupid's arrow struck my heart without My knowledge, a marksman extraordinaire Whose love of merriment removes all doubt From mind.  I can't forget your long dark hair Spilling over your olive shoulder, or A night of watching movies while we were In bed, and dinner conversation more Intimate than a kiss, and afternoons Of lazing next to you on grass as soft As linen sheets, and waking in our room And holding you as dawn held us aloft. Such moments linger, beautiful as dreams, Like water drunk from a cool running stream   Yeah, I know.  Pathetic.

       (For MJ, always)    Objective: one scarred heart Walled by heavy stone And surrounded by a moat.  Inventory my equipment: Long-distance desire, Roses and Chocolate.  The initial volley: Love offering, Drowned by diligent sentinel.  The second wave: Three long-stemmed roses Crushed against the wall.  Want to launch the third But the heart grows cold. I stare at the chocolates, hungry.

      1)  I'm going to keep the identities as anonymous as possible.  My wife will hereafter be referred to as MJ.  My children are D and S.  The woman with whom I had the extramarital relationship will be A.  2)  I am not looking for sympathy on this weblog.  What I did was inexcusable, and I accept any scorn that might be sent my way.  What I want is more than likely impossible, yet I cannot do anything else except try to fight for us.  If MJ can see her way clear into letting me back into her heart, then all will be worthwhile.  3)  This weblog will close either when my objective (preserving what is left of my family) has been reached or when I have exhausted all of my attempts to try to save my marriage.  I realize that this will be tough, and wish I could somehow make this go more quickly, but I'm in this for the long haul, folks, and I'm going to continue trying to win her back until papers are both signed and filed.  4)  MJ will probably never read this.  I had a previous weblog (which hasn't been updated in a week, and I don't intend to update it; I consider it closed), and even when we were still together and, for the most part, happily married, MJ seldom, if ever, read it.  She does not know the existence of this weblog, and I have no way of knowing whether or not she has ever or will ever read it.  But to me that doesn't matter.  I have started this because I need to write, and unless I continue writing I will be a wreck.  (Indeed, I had my own trepidations about writing another weblog int he first place.  Infidelity resulted because of a woman I had met who had read my journal.  I do not want that to happen again.)  5)  I will tell the story of my breakup in phases.  Some of it will be nonlinear, and I can't help that, but I'll try as much as I can to keep things in sequence.  6)  In all cases, I will be honest when writing about what is happening in my life.  This will be the only way to clear my conscience and regain my soul.  7)  I will answer personal questions, but if I decide to keep things to myself, or am reluctant to talk about them, I hope all readers understand.  More soon.

      I am a thirtysomething male who has to deal with infidelity on my part. I am not proud of what I have done, and must do a lot of work in order to save a marriage that, despite what my other half says, is  worth  saving. Whether or not I will be able to do so is still up in the air, for both Magaly and me.   I plan on using this weblog in an attempt at self-therapy, examining my life up to this point, and as a track record to see if I can (a) stay as faithful as I was before and (b) win my wife back.   I'll keep you posted on how all goes.

      It appears to be absolutely over.  I heard not a peep about the Niagra Falls roses, though when I called D a little over a week ago and asked about them he told me that she was positively delighted by them.  Figuring I had nothing to lose, I sent a small boquet of roses to MJ's office.  The response I received a couple of days later was, to say the least, vitriolic, with an e-mail that was titled simply "YOU HAVE GOT TO STOP!!!"  She went on to say that I was stressing the hell out of her, that this proved that I did not care for her in any way and was only thinking of myself.  When I told C about her response, he said,  of his sister , "That bitch..."  I'm ready to say fuck it.  I am ready to throw in the towel.  I already have too much I need to take care of, and I have far too much on my plate, both personally and economically, to try to deal with rebuilding my broken marriage.  I'm facing some heavy bills in September, and I need to consider finding part-time employment in order to take care of them.  I have some things I'd like to write, and that will more than likely keep me busy for at least a couple of months.  I have my hands full.  And yet.  And yet there are indications, maybe some false hope on my part, that it may not be over.  I talked to D yesterday, and I asked him if MJ missed me at all.  When he said, "Yes," I asked him how he could tell.  "I just can," he said to me.  And when the Niagra Falls roses died, D said that MJ kept the petals.  She might say it's over, but if she really felt that, then why is she keeping the petals?  Hell, why didn't she tell me to stop when she got back from Niagra Falls?  God, I wish I knew what to do.  Part of me hurts like hell because of the things that have happened, part of me wants to hurt her because of my own emotional state, part of me wants desperately to move on, and part of me just wants to find some way to salvage what was a very good marriage.  And part of me wants to just say "fuck it" and run off with the woman at the center of this dispute, the woman who does, in fact, love me.  As of now, I am severing contact with her.  Completely.  I will call the boys when she's at work, and if her brother learns anything from her he has assured me he will tell me.  But, as of now, I'm through with it.  I will not take her calls, and I've place my inbox on its highest settings so that I will receive no mail from her.  This does not mean that I don't want to fix things.  What it does mean is that I need time to regroup and reconsider everything.  I'll focus on me, and at least for the time being accept life without her.  D did tell me that she was fairly certain that she would not get the promotion she desired, one of the key reasons she wanted to make the move up in the first place.  If that happens, the boys, or at least D, will come back within a couple of weeks.  How I'm going to handle that, I have no idea, but my feeling is that, if that is indeed the case, she needs to tell me something very soon.  I've already put my life on hold for her for the past year; I'm not going to spend another few weeks in statis.  Fuck it.
