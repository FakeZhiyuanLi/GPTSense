      Hey!! It has been a while since I had my first post!! I was having my mid year exams and also am preparing for my chinese O levels which is on the 31 of june!! Well, I cannot say that i am well prepared but i also feel that i am pretty much done with the revision!! I think i shall give myself a treat by going for a movie!!  Anyway..the term break is starting and i shall be heading for the tanning studio since i do not think the sun here is quite good...imagine all the UV rays and those darn crowds..never the less..i shall be comitted into looking good...despite of the rising temperatures! I am currently reading the books 5 of the Gossipgirl Series!! It totally rocks my world...enjoyed it so much!! I am so happy that the next harry potter movie is coming out!! I am not exactly a avid fan of HP series but i find Daniel Radcliffe veryy cute!! And to say the truth, i quite like the story line!! I just don't understand why the misconception people have with the movie...afterall it is all about good defeating evil... I have been listening to some cds which includes...JET!! and of cause Maroon 5...Andy is just so handsome!!

      Life's been crazy of late. All the homework are piling up, i have not enough time to even take a breather to update both my blog and diary. I have seen Xiaxue's blog. I think it is quite straightforward. But, i am not going to give comments about her blog as mine is not fantastic enough to comment on others. Even though my blog may seem to be so dull, but I promise that i will try to make it more attractive. Have been reading web comics such as  urlLink bobbin  and  urlLink Slackers . Now for my life!!>> Been quite sad about the class of late. I have one thing to say to certain people(i do not wish to name names as i still have a reputation to uphold, but it would seem quite obvious to the person which i am pinpointing at), and that is to "F*** Off". You know what, they should just get a life and stop being a lifeless moron. And if you think that you are sorry, good for you but don't expect me to forgive you until you start to crawl on your knees and BEG me for forgiveness. I am so sorry to start the entry with such negative thoughts of the past few days. And another thing, if you think you are pretty in any sense, get a new mirror cause i suspect your mirror is givng you distorted images... Bad for health and you are lying to yourself. Tomorrow is Singapore's 39th anniversary!! *Cheers* school is closed for monday and tuesday!! Ok...gotta go finish up the assignment!!!
