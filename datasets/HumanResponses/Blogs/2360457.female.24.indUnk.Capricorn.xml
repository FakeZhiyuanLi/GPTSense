      Summer is the best time to watch old movies.  There isn’t really anything on TV, except reruns.  Since I saw the shows I like the first time, I really only watch reruns of crime shows like Law and Order or Without a Trace.  But honestly, I don’t need an excuse to watch old movies.  It’s just a good reasoning -- especially since I don’t have cable.  And tonight I got to watch another Van Johnson movie.  Yes, my curiosity in this popular 1940s/1950s movie star has spread, and I’ve got a couple people supplying me with his movies.   urlLink Two Girls and a Sailor  was actually Johnson’s first top billing movie -- as well as Gloria DeHaven and June Allyson’s first big parts.  It’s a pretty fluffy story about two female musicians.  The Deyo Sisters – Patsy (Allyson) and Jean (DeHaven) – have an act at a club in what I am going to assume is California during WWII.  So the rather thin plot is stretched out by a lot of performances by other musicians and singers, including Lena Horne, Jimmy Durante (who is surprisingly funny!), Gracie Allen, and several orchestras.    The story – albeit thin – is pretty good, but standard.  Jean and Patsy have their nightclub act, but after hours, they run a canteen for servicemen in their home.  How they manage to afford to supply all the sailors and soldiers with sandwiches and pop is never quite clear, but taking into consideration the size of their apartment, they must be making pretty good money at the club.  Jean is the cuter sister and has an admirer who keeps sending her orchids.  One night they are inviting young men to their canteen and Jean gets to invite a sailor (Johnson) to the canteen.  He isn’t known by his name -- he's mostly just “Hey Sailor.”  The girls sing and get to know the sailor and another soldier, Frank (Tom Drake).  These are the two rivals for Jean’s affections, but Patsy seems to like the sailor too.  What will happen?  The girls mention that they wished they had the warehouse across the street from their apartment, and the next day someone shows up at their door with the keys and the deed.  "Someone" has decided that the Deyo Sisters deserve to get what they wish for -- but who is this "someone?"  The sisters explore the warehouse, which turns out not to be haunted by ghosts, but rather by Billy Kidd (Durante) who they used to tour with as children.  And this isn’t an ordinary warehouse -- it's a theatrical warehouse which makes it so much easier to clean up and transform into a spectacular nightclub/canteen.  (It’s an MGM musical, so I didn’t expect any realism.)  Jean continues to get on well with the sailor, much to the dismay of Patsy.  She even ends up having a dream about it.  It’s a pretty standard dream sequence, although the sailor shows up in an admiral’s uniform, complete with enormous epaulets.  The most memorable part of the dream is the catfight between sisters over the sailor.  Seriously girls, is he really worth fighting over?  The next morning Billy manages to overhear one of the assistants with the club’s overhauling mention that "someone" can afford to pay extra -- it's J. Dykeman Brown who is paying for this!  He tells Patsy, who manages to track down J. Dykeman Brown, who is old enough to be Jean’s grandfather!  It turns out that he’s J. Dukeman Brown, and there’s a J. Dykeman Brown II, and finally, J. Dykeman Brown the Third -- the sailor!  Johnny has been hiding a secret -- he's worth sixty million dollars!  Patsy, of course, is heartbroken, so the oldest J. Dykeman Brown comforts her by saying "At your age I wouldn’t have fallen in love with your sister."  The nightclub opens again, complete with a plethora of musical numbers.  Patsy reveals to Jean "someone’s" real identity, and she is more happy with his cash than with him.  Jean decides to leave to do a single act in Buffalo, but before leaving, the Deyo Sisters need to do one last act together.  Jean realizes that she really doesn’t love Johnny -- she's in love with the Texan soldier Frank who calls her ma’am.  (It really is adorable.)  She’s going to move to Texas and raise onions with him.  Yay.  So Johnny is left for Jean to have -- and he’s realized that he’s in love with her, not Jean.  All the couples are complete, so all that’s left is for the final big number.  Two Girls and a Sailor is pretty chintzy and predictable, but I enjoyed it.  They don’t make movies like this anymore -- musicals like this have gone out of vogue, and nightclubs like the one portrayed in the movie don’t seem to exist any more.  It’s a nice look at an era gone by.

      I finally watched  urlLink Saving Private Ryan  today.  What a powerful movie.  I’m actually kind of glad that I didn’t see it in the theater – it was very moving to see, but I think it would have been even more overwhelming if I had seen it ten feet high in the dark with no distractions.  I almost had the opportunity to see it when it came out – my dad picked me up one weekend when I came home from school in Milwaukee, and it was playing at a second run theater.  I was the only person in the family who would go see it with him, but when we got to theater, it had stopped showing, despite what the sign outside said.  So, six years later, I finally saw it.  I had heard about the first twenty minutes and the graphic carnage it showed of the D-Day landing at Omaha Beach.  It lived up to its reputation.  The senselessness of war became obvious as I watched the men try to get on the beach and just die, creating piles of bodies.  I had heard about the beaches being washed with blood, but the movie made it real.  The moments of silence – as I later learned were supposed to be Tom Hank’s character’s moments of deafness – seemed poignant and almost worse than hearing the whiz of bullets and explosions.  What I imagined was going on was almost worse – and it seemed to point out the hopelessness of war, how it doesn’t make any sense.  The second act – when Hanks and company go off in search of Private Ryan – proved to be the typical narrative of a WWII movie.  Although, I might say, it was rather refreshing to have average, normal, what I would think are representative soldiers, instead of a cast of characters like many of my other favorite WWII movies (The Dirty Dozen, The Great Escape, etc.).  I read  urlLink Ebert’s review  of the movie afterwards, and I thought his observation that the translator (who I totally thought was  urlLink Henry Thomas  – he and  urlLink Jeremy Davies  could be twins!) was the point of entry for him into the movie.  I agreed – I felt that if I were in a war, I would be the civilian unprepared for the realities of actual fighting.  His confusion with the war – and especially his expectations for the company to accept him – gave me a way to understand how to come to terms with the rest of the film.  The third act – after Ryan is found and the company defends the bridge was probably the most interesting.  After recently seen The Bridge of the River Kwai, I found this part of protecting a bridge fairly interesting.  And I began to identify the characters more strongly – they had actually bonded before the Germans came.  I understood the fighting in vague terms – what they were trying to defend and how their movements affected one another.  Although I was slightly disturbed by my reaction to the translator’s inability to fight with the Germans – I kept urging him to go upstairs and save his comrades.  Well, this wasn’t a Hollywood movie, and he couldn’t manage to pull himself together until it was too late.  Saving Private Ryan was a great movie – one that I don’t think I will soon forget.  It makes me think about war differently, although I still believe that WWII is the main touchstone of the 20th century for Americans.  It is hard to watch a movie about a war right now and not think about the differences between back then and the war we are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Things seemed so much clearer back then – the enemies were more black and white – you were either Axis or Allies, German or American.  WWII seems to be a war that we as Americans keep going back to, perhaps because it has an ending that is easily understood.  Good triumphed over evil.  WWII was also so well documented, even as the war was  going on, Hollywood made films to inspire those on the homefront.  I’m always a fan of watching the Memorial Day marathons on various cable channels, and the amount of WWII movies always outnumbers WWI and all the other various wars or conflicts that the US has fought in.  Perhaps going back to WWII and creating fiction out of the facts makes us hope that we can create some understanding out of the wars fought afterwards – that understanding reasons for a war that is clearer can help us understand why the more confusing wars were fought afterwards.  But enough philosophy for now -- I loved the use of color in the movie.  It was washed out and felt real.  The use of handheld cameras for the beach scenes and most of the combat scenes made it feel less like a Hollywood movie made in the 1990s harkening back to 1944, but as if it could have been a documentary, that a camera crew followed the search for Private Ryan.  The opening and closing shots of the transluscent American flag was just right.  Seeing Saving Private Ryan makes me question how  urlLink Shakespeare in Love  managed to win the Best Picture Oscar over this film.  I have no doubt which one will be more talked about fifty years in the future -- and it will not have Ben Affleck in it.

      Van Johnson, that is.  My friend Shayna has kindly offered to tape two of his movies for me recently --  urlLink Easy to Wed , a remake of Libeled Lady, and  urlLink Invitation .  I watched Invitation this afternoon, and what a hoot it was!  It is a total soaper -- Dorothy McGuire plays a woman (Ellen) with a heart condition.  She can't be active and ends up leading a rather quiet life.  Her father dotes on her, and after finding out she only has a year to live, he sets her up with Dan (Johnson) -- a struggling architect -- who he tempts with the offer of work.  Dan doesn't necessarily take him up on directly, but he does end up marrying Dorothy before falling in love with her.  Flash forward ten months -- and Ellen finds out!  Maud, Dan's ex-girlfriend, is extremely jealous and sends her an invitation to a dinner for a heart specialist -- and Ellen finally puts two and two together and makes four.  She confronts her father and Dan.  Dan tells her the truth -- he didn't exactly love her when they got married, but he does now, and he's found her a specialist (from Baltimore!) who will operate on her.  Ah, happy ending, and Ellen lives to see the spring.  Invitation was fairly entertaining, but primarily only as a soap.  I wouldn't recommend seeing it unless you're a die-hard Johnson or McGuire fan.  The story is pretty far-fetched, but it seems a relict from the early '50s.

      More old Hollywood gossip -- I've been busy reading biographies this week.   urlLink Golden Boy: The Untold Story of William Holden  is the only biography of William Holden and it is an incredibly crappy book.  The author writes the biography as if he was there, transcribing the conversations from a variety of Hollywood stars.  After I finished the first chapter, I wanted to return the book to the library, but I decided to carry on to get a quasi-real story about Holden.  And what a sordid story I got.  Basically, he was an alcoholic.  Holden had to drink before he was able to act in movies, and much is made of the couple belts he would take before a scene.  The drinking eventually lead to his downfall -- and actually caused his death.  Holden died from a laceration to his forehead which was caused by hitting his head during a bout of heavy drinking. He apparently remained conscious for half an hour or so after the injury but never realized he should phone for help and died.  The author coyly refers to his reputation as a lady's man, and the affairs he apparently had with his co-stars, but I didn't get many details on many of them.  The most interesting is that he was going to leave his wife for Audrey Hepburn after starring in  urlLink Sabrina .  But she wanted to have kids, and he no longer could have them, thanks to surgery.  (Snip-snip!)    I think I may be a little harsh on the bio -- but seriously, the writing style was awful.  Leonard Maltin sums it up in his  urlLink mini-bio  by saying, "Bob Thomas' melancholy biography, "Golden Boy," revealed that the handsome, self-assured actor so admired by men and women alike onscreen was in fact a man fraught with insecurity who essentially drank himself to an early grave."

      I just finished reading a biography about Judy Garland, aptly titled  urlLink Get Happy: The Life of Judy Garland .  Now, I knew that Garland had a fairly messed up life.  Anyone who has five husbands has got to be troubled (just look at Zsa Zsa Gabor, Elizabeth Taylor, and the current star heading that way, J-Lo), but I didn't realize the depth of her problems.  The book is a quick read -- despite its 500+ pages, I managed to read it in an evening.  It just reveals so much about Garland, but doesn't seem to verify any of the details.  The author has extensive footnoting, an enormous bibliography (including several books I've read!), and a large list of people that he has interviewed in order to write the book, but it didn't seem to ring very true with me as I was reading it.  I believe the general outlines of his work -- Garland was so troubled, and her childhood problems with her closeted gay father and her demanding mother must have created some of the issues she had with sex.    I read a  urlLink biography  of Garland years ago -- back when I became an old movie fan -- and I remember feeling sorry for Garland.  Her life story made me cry.  But now, over ten years later, I don't have as much sympathy for her.  Her life was awful, yes.  She was controlled with pills given to her by her boss L.B. Mayer and her mother.  But it seems as though she never really took responsibility for very long.  She reinvented herself, became Judy Garland III and conquered the stage -- but it never lasted long enough.  She seems to fit the stereotype of the old Romantic poets -- they had to die young, or else they would become irrelevant.  Garland had to have drama in her life or else it wasn't worth living.

      I've decided that my  urlLink main blog  has become a little too occupied by the movies I watch.  So I decided to make a blog devoted strictly to movies.  And of course, old Hollywood gossip.  I got the title (kind of) from a book that I won as the best essayist overall in a film class I took my freshman year in college.  The book that I won was actually not called Watching in the Dark, as I thought it was, but  urlLink Awake in the Dark: An anthology of American film criticism, 1915 to the present .    So here I'll post lists of AFI 100 movies and comment on the ones that I like and stuff like that.  My  urlLink Turner Classic Movies  love -- despite not having cable -- will be proudly displayed.  And I will share old Hollywood gossip from the biographies I read.  It should be a good time.  Moving to Maryland has reawoken my love of old movies, and I actually have a couple friends here who are just as much into old films -- and new films -- as I am, perhaps even more so.

      And what is it that I have got?   urlLink Van Johnson: MGM's Golden Boy !  I'm hoping to get through it this weekend -- it's definitely not a long book, so I should be able to zip through it pretty quick.  Although, I might add, I am very disappointed by the lack of photos!  I want (at very least) glossy black and white photos of Van throughout his life.  Cutesy baby pictures, embarassing adolescent pictures, his accomplishments on the stage, stills from a couple movies, and maybe a few family photos.  Sigh.  I guess that's what happens when you don't get your subject's permission to write the book.  Sad.

      I recently read a really interesting book all about the studio system.   urlLink The Genius of the System: Hollywood Filmmaking in the Studio Era  by Thomas Schatz was fascinating.  I was familiar with the studio era -- the so-called “Golden Era” of filmmaking from the 20s through the late 40s and early 50s – but I really only knew one studio, MGM.  And of course, my favorite studio executive,  urlLink Irving Thalberg , who was really cute.  But this book opened my eyes to more than just MGM -- there was Warner Brothers, RKO, David O. Selznick, etc.  It seems like Irving was probably the most skilled at working the studio system in order to get quality product out of it, but he was not the only person capable of running the studio.    The book covers the filmmaking process in parts, but definitely looks at it from more of a business perspective.  I had never really thought of filmmaking as a business before.  Obviously, there is the obsession with box-office grosses now, but first and foremost, I think of filmmaking as a kind of art.  But apparently that is more of a modern idea -- I believe it came from the idea of the director as auteur and sole creator of a film.  After reading this book, I realized that there is definitely a lot of input and restrictions and advice by others than appears on the surface.  I don’t know that this book would be a good read if you weren’t interested in the business aspect of filmmaking, or wanted a more in-depth look at the mechanics behind the stars, but I found it very interesting.  It seems rare to have a look at the moguls who financed and made the mechanics of filmmaking work.  But if you agree that Irving Thalberg is cute, I would suggest reading this.  It shows that he was both a cute creative guy with a shrewd sense of business.

      I have been watching movies and reading movie related books -- but I just haven't had the opportunity to write about them lately.  (Yes, things are busier at work!)  But today I am getting cable television installed.  And with it I will have several movie channels, including (best of all!)  urlLink TCM .  And August is going to be an excellent month for TCM.  It's a different star every day -- and I've already gone through their schedule and have found thirty-one movies that look good.  THIRTY-ONE!  That's a movie a day!  So my goal for August is to write about a movie a day.  And as August ends, I'm going to try get up my thoughts on several movies I've recently seen, why Van Johnson remains fascinating to me, how Jimmy Cagney is actually kind of hot, and the books I've been reading.  All in the next forty-eight hours!

      And there is one particular remake in mind that I want to discuss: The Manchurian Candidate.    I love  urlLink The Manchurian Candidate .  I saw it in the Intro to Film class that I was a senior mentor for, and I was very much drawn into the story of Raymond Shaw and his brainwashing.  It was very much a movie of its era -- fear from the Cold War and what could possibly happen, including the assassination of a presidential candidate.  After seeing the film, I went out and got a copy off of Ebay.  The one scene that I absolutely love from The Manchurian Candidate is when the men believe that they are at a meeting of a women's gardening club and the camera pans 360 degrees to eventually show that they are before their enemies.  What a technological advancement -- and it stands up today!  So why did they decide to remake it?  I don't know -- it was such a great movie.  I know that the remake includes some great contemporary actors --  urlLink Denzel Washington ,  urlLink Meryl Streep , and  urlLink Liev Schreiber  (the lone reason I would even  think  of seeing it).  But the original had  urlLink Frank Sinatra  (at his sweaty best!)  urlLink Laurence Harvey  (perfect as the uptight sargent), and  urlLink Angela Lansbury  (whom I will never forget as the evil mother).  The supporting characters were great as well --  urlLink James Gregory  as Johnny Iselin was the perfect buffoon manipulated by his wife and  urlLink John McGiver  as Senator Thomas, the lone vocal opposition to Iseland and his witch hunts!  Angela Lansbury also said in  urlLink Entertainment Weekly  about the remake: I'm so unhappy. I'm so sorry they had to mess with something that was so perfect. I couldn't believe it when I heard they were remaking it. I said, "There's no way they would be foolish enough to walk into that trap."  (On Meryl Streep): "I have great admiration for her. She'll probably be very interesting. I just wish she hadn't chosen to do it." From the commercials that I've seen for the remake, it looks like it's getting pretty good reviews.  And apparently Ebert and Roeper gave it two thumbs up.  And there is the worst part about a remake -- I want film critics to say that it is horrible -- especially ones like Ebert who really do appreciate classic films -- and judge it in the shadow of its predecessor.  But when they say good things about it, I can't help but think that maybe it is a good movie.  Perhaps not good enough for the  urlLink AFI 100 Years...100 Movies  list (the original is number sixty-seven!), but good enough to enjoy during the summer?  I mean, after all, if it is up to par with the original, they would release it in the winter near Oscar season?  You'd think so...

      While I was home on vacation, I managed to go through some of the books that I left back in Wisconsin.  These includes some of my film reference books -- some of which are better than others.  But one of them came back to Baltimore with me --  urlLink The Great Movie Stars: The International Years  by David Shipman.  It's another great biographical dictionary of movie stars.  Sadly, it does not include lists of films (as The MGM Stock Company did), but it covers a wide variety of actors and actresses from the late '40s through 1972.  And it includes a lot of international stars (hence the name!), many of whom I have never heard of.    It's got lots of pictures, and best of all, entries on people like  urlLink Tab Hunter ,  urlLink Terry-Thomas , and  urlLink Laurence Harvey .  Quality!  I remember when I bought -- it was in Lansing, MI at a bookstore during the mid-1990s.  I didn't have enough money to buy both volumes, so I decided to get the second one.  I don't know what led me to buy it -- but I'm glad I did.  I've read lots of books on golden age Hollywood stars, but not so many on the stars of the later years.  And I will eventually track down a copy of  urlLink The Great Movie Stars: The Golden Years !

       urlLink Cape Fear  is a grown up suspense film.  I'm talking about the original 1962 version starring  urlLink Gregory Peck  and  urlLink Robert Mitchum , not some remake with a psycho tattooed  urlLink Robert De Niro .  Anyway, it's pretty darn entertaining and suspenseful film.  Peck plays Sam Bowden, a lawyer in some small southern town, who years before was witness to a crime (in Baltimore!) committed by Max Cady (Mitchum).  Cady is out of prison, and he's not very happy with Bowden, who he thinks ruined his life after his wife left him while he was in prison.  Cady used his time in prison to his advantage, and he's become quite the jailhouse lawyer.  Bowden recognizes the threat right away, and gets his police chief friend involved to run Cady out of town, but it doesn't work.  The whole movie is incredibly suspenseful, and Cady is very menancing.  I wouldn't want him near me or my family!  After taking much of Cady's menancing (and after he poisons the family dog), Bowden finally uses his wife and daughter as bait to lure Cady up to a houseboat on Cape Fear.  He takes the bait, and chases after the wife at first, but then switches tactics to go after the daughter.  Will he abuse the young daughter before Bowden can get to him?  The music is fantastic in the movie --  urlLink Bernard Herrmann  is excellent, as usual.   urlLink Telly Savalas  shows up as a private detective and actually has hair.  And  urlLink Martin Balsam , best known to me from  urlLink Psycho  is the police chief trying to help Bowden get Cady out of town.  It's hard to judge this movie, especially based on movie standards now.  I kept expecting something more to happen, more blood, more violence.  It was refreshing for  me to watch a movie which was still be very suspenseful but yet it didn't go over the boundries of "good taste."

      While I was back home in Wisconsin, I went to  urlLink Schwartz's Bookstore  in Milwaukee.  I looked through the section that covers movies and movie criticism and that's when I saw it.   urlLink The Golden Era: The MGM Stock Company .  As the blurb on the front cover says, "Stardust to goldust...the great actors and actresses on the MGM lot."  And isn't it fantastic!  For only $7.95 I got "a cornucopia of film lore, with carefully detailed biographies and career studies of nearly 150 MGM greats from  urlLink June Allyson  to  urlLink Robert Young ."  June Allyson!  Robert Young!  And everyone else from A to Y!  Actually, it is a really great reference materials, especially for someone like me who is very interested in MGM.  It's got biographies of the actors, lots of film stills, and best of all, a list of films that they appeared in, including the company that made it and the year made.  At the end, the authors include a brief history of MGM, really short biographies of the various MGM executives (including Irving Thalberg, my hero!), and a list of MGM Academy Award Nominations and Winners.  It's not really the type of book that you would sit down and read straight through, but is worth dipping through to read about various stars.  The only downside is that it's from 1972, so many of the stars included have died by now.

      My obsession with  urlLink Van Johnson , or as I'm going to start calling him from now on, V-Jo is reaching its nadir.    I searched Amazon a month ago or so to see if he had an autobiography or biography floating around there.  Apparently not too many people share my love for V-Jo and there is only one biography -- and it sounds juicy!   urlLink Van Johnson: Mgm's Golden Boy  was published back in 2001 and I didn't find at either the library I work at or the library that I patronize as a non-librarian.  But it's available at some other libraries in Maryland -- and I will have it!  And then I will learn what V-Jo's life was really like.  Excellent...

      I watched  urlLink Stage Door Canteen  in bits and pieces over the last few days.  It was one I taped during my Memorial Day tape-a-thon, and it came right after  urlLink Above and Beyond , a cheesy WWII movie starring  urlLink Robert Taylor  (best known [to me at least] as  urlLink Johnny Eager ).  I'm saving that one for another day.  So, Stage Door Canteen.  It's all about the fabled Stage Door Canteen that served young servicemen in New York City during WWII.  Apparently, lots of famous people actually worked there, and the movie is jam-packed with appearances by various famous people, my favorites being  urlLink Johnny Weissmuller ,  urlLink Katherine Hepburn , and  urlLink Gypsy Lee Rose , who sadly does not take it  all  off.    While watching the movie, you follow four soldiers who have twenty-four hour passes.  Dakota, hailing from one of the Dakotas, California, the young, innocent, never-been-kissed boy, a guy from down South named Tex, and Jersey.  Jersey's the only one with a girl, and he ends up getting married by the end of the film and not enjoying the Stage Door Canteen.  Too bad for him, because Dakota, Tex, and California all end up meeting wonderful hostesses who make their last days before leaving worthwhile.  California even manages to have his first kiss on the dance floor and Dakota warms up a chilly hostess (called a heel by her roommates!) by the end of their third twenty-four hour pass.  Basically, Stage Door Canteen follows the same theme as  urlLink Two Girls and a Sailor , as kind of a musical revue.  There are lots of songs and dances by popular musical groups of the day, and a plethora of movie and stage stars popping up.  The plot is terribly thin, but it's entertaining enough.  I don't think I'll ever feel the need to watch it again, but I felt like it gives a good flavor for the era.  Stage Door Canteen is from 1943, back when the war was less certain, and it gives the feeling that people really did care about the soldiers, marines, sailors, and airmen and what happened to them.

      Yeah, responsibility to make a more interesting and entertaining movie.  On a very rainy Fourth of July, I saw  urlLink Spiderman 2  in the theater.  I had never since the first installment of this comic book adaptation, but my choices were very limited: Shrek 2 or The Stepford Wives.  I would like to think that I chose the best of three evils.  Anyway, it's a basic comic book story with the exception that Spiderman is conflicted.  Oh, he's so sad and mopey.  Totally emo, only he's a superhero type guy and doesn't want to love any one because then they'll be in danger.  (Say it with me: Awww.)  So he pushes away Mary Jane for her sake.  And gives up being Spiderman to be normal Peter Parker.  But then Doc Oc -- some freaked out Alfred Molina who has been taken over by four robotic arms.  And he wants to create some big energy source -- because his love has been taken away from him!  The best part of the movie has to be  urlLink J.K. Simmons  as J. Jonah Jameson, the crazy editor-in-chief of the Daily Bugel.  He manages to come across as the stereotypical 1940s editor -- chomping his cigar and everything.  His scenes were the funniest bits out of a very mopey movie.  Yes, Roger Ebert gave it  urlLink four stars , but I honestly think he steered me wrong.  Or perhaps I will never appreciate the superhero genre of movies.

      Wow.  I just went to the New York Times to finish reading an article and his  urlLink obituary  was on the front page.    I can't say that I have a lot of opinions about Marlon Brando -- I've only seen a few of his movies and my personal favorite is probably  urlLink Guys and Dolls , a choice few Brando fans would probably make.    But he is such a name in acting -- it seems as though, as the obit in the Times mentions, acting is divided into before Brando and then after Brando.  Film even has a way of dividing itself fairly neatly -- around 1950 things began to start changing, and Marlon Brando was one of the reasons.  He will be missed.

      I got new DVDs on Tuesday night.  It always such fun to come home and actually have a package sitting on the register for me.  It so rarely happens that I was especially happy to see the DVDs.  And they are the last DVDs that I will be getting until September.  I have officially sworn off DVDs -- in fact, I wasn't even supposed to buy these.  But I got them from  urlLink Deep DVD Discount  which has awesome prices in the first place and then I got an extra 20% off with a secret code.  So I got three DVDs for $7.50 each --  urlLink Breakfast at Tiffanys ,  urlLink Sabrina , and (although this one hasn't been delivered yet)  urlLink Paris...When It Sizzles .  I also got  urlLink It Happened One Night  for under $15 I believe.  So it was like around $10 per DVD -- an excellent price.  But, unfortunately, I cannot afford to keep getting DVDs.  At the rate I'm going, I could get cable and it would be cheaper.  But it is so fun to get new DVDs.  I love unwrapping all the plastic, peeling off the stickers, and opening them up to remove the security tags.  Ah, what fun.

      I have been taping like mad, and this weekend will be even worse with  urlLink TCM  featuring  four   urlLink Hepburn - urlLink Tracy  movies.  (Sadly, it does not include  urlLink State of the Union  which features as the third lead, my favorite  urlLink Van .)    I have made it exactly half way through  urlLink Night Nurse , a fantastically cheesy pre-Code flick starring  urlLink Barbara Stanwyck .  And I also got in the mail -- so it's going to be an additional film to the thirty-one I'm watching on TCM --  urlLink Paris - When It Sizzles .  It stars  urlLink Audrey Hepburn  and  urlLink William Holden  and is  so  bad it's good.  It reminds me of my favorite '60s Audrey Hepburn films --  urlLink How to Steal a Million  (coming out on DVD this fall!!) and  urlLink Charade .    More movies are being taped daily, and I will catch up with writing reviews soon.

      My love of all things Van has spread among my co-workers who love movies as much as I do.  And last night I got a phone call from one of them asking if I had seen the movie on  urlLink TCM  tonight.  It had  urlLink Van Heflin , and he knew that I was a fan and had even taped it for me!  Now I had actually watched the movie myself, and knew that it wasn't worth saving.  But after a little bit of discussion about how terrible  urlLink B.F.'s Daughter  was, Tom asked me if Van Heflin and  urlLink Van Johnson  had ever done a movie together.  Now, I was not sure, so I said I didn't think so.  I didn't think that the two would be in the same types of movies, especially since Johnson was such a stereotypical fifties boy and Heflin was more cynical.  But I went to the  urlLink IMBd  and searched for their names together.   And the Vans did collide once -- not surprising, considering they were both at MGM at the same time -- but it was in the biopic of Jerome Kern's life,  urlLink Till the Clouds Roll By .  Heflin has higher billing than Johnson -- he plays James I. Hessler -- while Johnson is bandleader in the Elite Club.  I must find this movie and watch it, if only to see if they do a scene together!

      Is love at first sight possible?  This movie tries to answer the question, and educate the viewers about economics at the same time.  Its day two of Summer Under the Stars, and  urlLink Barbara Stanwyck  is the featured star of the day.  She is the title character --  urlLink B.F.’s Daughter  -- in this film.  Stanwyck plays Polly Fulton, daughter of B.F. Fulton, a rich entrepreneur.  She is engaged to a lawyer, who refuses to marry her until he is on his own two feet.  After giving him some insider knowledge about her father’s company to help further his career, Polly goes to a speakeasy with her friend “Apples.”  And while at the speakeasy -- which is filled with intellectuals -- she meets Tom Brett (played by  urlLink Van Heflin ).  The two engage in conversation about economics -- he's an associate economics professor at Columbia University.  After knowing each other for less than twenty-four hours, Tom and Polly get married -- despite the fact that Tom doesn’t like B.F. and what he stands for -- and end up honeymooning in a cabin on an island in Minnesota during the winter.  Tom writes a book on economic policy and tries to get a lecture tour.  But he is unable to get one himself, so Polly arranges for him to get one without his knowledge.  The lecture tour is incredibly successful, and he continues to go on and on and on about economic policy for eight years.  Meanwhile, Polly builds an enormous home in Connecticut, much to the disapproval of Tom.  He does not want to be so bourgeois -- and also does not want to take any money from his father-in-law.  There is much arguing between the two, and Tom finds out about how she arranged the first lecture tour.  By the end of the night, B.F. ends up getting sick, and dies the next day.  Finally, Polly needs Tom -- but he needs to go to Lisbon to help a girl from the exiled Dutch government.  Sigh!  What is a man to do?  Tom is a dutiful citizen and leaves his wife behind.    There is much misunderstanding between the two, and eventually Polly finds out there is another woman!  She tracks her down and finds out that she’s a blind Dutch woman in love with Tom.  Polly feels like the blind lady would be perfect for Tom -- she really needs him, while Polly does not.  Eventually everything gets ironed out, and the film ends with Polly saying, “Oh Tom, I really need you!” and Tom says something else back and they kiss.  Yay.  B.F.’s Daughter is nothing to write home about.  I only watched it because I really enjoy Van Heflin (he’s my second favorite Van from MGM).  He’s just so good at playing sarcastic, and I think if he had been born in the present, he’d still be able to be an actor.  Sarcasm never seems to go out of style, and he’s just really good at the biting roles.   urlLink Keenan Wynn  was pretty good in the role of the side-kick on the radio, and less annoying than in  urlLink Easy to Wed .  So, in a word, unless you really like Van Heflin, don't stop for this film.

      There is  urlLink Van Johnson  love on the Internet.  While searching for images for my ultimate recap/review of  urlLink Van Johnson: MGM's Golden Boy  (already at 1,300 words and still not done!), and I came across a totally awesome site.   urlLink How Van Johnson Won the War  is a review of three Johnson war films -- two WWII era films and one post-WWII.   urlLink Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo ,  urlLink Battleground , and  urlLink The Caine Mutiny  are the three films included in Johnson's winning the war.  My favorite part is that the review of Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo includes this about Johnson's performance: "And my boy Van?  Granted I am prejudiced in his favor, but this is some of his finest work."  Awesome.  Someone else enjoys V-Jo as much as I do!

      Day one of summer of the stars features  urlLink John Wayne , an actor who I am usually not too impressed by.  I'm definitely more of an anti-Western fan, and I'd take  urlLink Clint Eastwood  over John Wayne any day.  But in order to fully experience thirty-one movies this month, I decided to give John Wayne a try.  And I ended up with the least stereotypical John Wayne movie ever --  urlLink The Quiet Man .  Wayne plays Sean Thorne, an Irish-born American boxer who moves back to his birthplace in Ireland.  He meets Mary Kate (played by  urlLink Maureen O'Hara ) and immediately begins courting her, despite the fact that her bachelor older brother does not want to lose her as his cook and housekeeper.  The movie would be a great one to see on the big screen -- it's got such great Technicolor scenery!  The Quiet Man is also very typically Irish -- lush green scenery, lovely accents, horse racing, and excellent music.  The story proceeds with some of the villagers -- including the matchmaker -- conning Mary Kate's brother into giving her a dowry (she calls it a fortune) so the two of them can start the courtship.  They also hint that if he gets rid of his sister, the brother will be able to convince the local widow that he's been courting for ten years to marry him.  While courting Mary Kate, Sean manages to get away from the matchmaker and chases her into a graveyard.  They have their first kiss there, not only in the graveyard but also during a rainstorm.  How romantic!  But apparently the kissing came a little to early in their courtship, because in the next scene Sean and Mary Kate are getting married -- perhaps he compromised her so thoroughly that the marriage had to be immediate.  After the wedding, the brother announces his imminent marriages -- but it turns out that he hasn't asked the widow yet!  She turns him down, as any woman should, and the brother realizes that he's been duped.  And he's not happy about being duped, and takes back his sister's dowry and manages to punch Sean.  Sean flashes back to the ring, where he has just knocked out an opponent -- a fatal knockout (just like  urlLink Killer McCoy !).  Mary Kate lives up to her feisty Irish reputation, and refuses to be a real wife to Sean until she gets her things and fortune back.  They have a total  urlLink Gone With the Wind  moment, as Mary Kate locks herself in their bedroom.  Sean breaks down the door and says, "There'll be no locks or bolts between us, Mary Kate...except those in your own mercenary little heart!"  He then gives her a passionate kiss and throws her down on the bed.  Mary Kate gets her things back in the morning -- the villagers were going to bring them back in the previous evening, but they thought the couple would be busy (making little Sean and Mary Kates).    I got distracted by the end of the movie, but it ends up with the brother challenging Sean to a fight.  He, of course, does not want to fight after killing a man and he ends up speaking to the vicar about it.  Mary Kate feels embarassed by her husband and ends up speaking to the priest about it.  I don't really understand why she ends up leaving, but Mary Kate gets on a train headed to Dublin to avoid the problems with her husband and brother.  Sean rides his horse to her rescue and drags her back to the town and confronts her brother.  He gives Sean the dowry money, and they burn it afterwards.  A big fight starts and eventually the movie ends happily, with the brother courting the widow and Sean and Mary Kate happy together again.  I was pleasantly surprised by The Quiet Man.  I don't really understand where the title comes from, other than the fact that Sean wanted to keep his previous life as a boxer quiet.  I found John Wayne to be fairly attractive, and less John Wayne-ish than usual.  His voice is so soothing and just very familar and comfortable.  There aren't any actors like him any more.

       urlLink Turner Classic Movies  is doing  urlLink "Summer Under the Stars"  during the month of August.  A new star is featured each day with twenty-four hours of their films.  I have gone through the entire schedule for August and have decided upon thirty-one films to watch.  Unfortunately, I don’t enjoy every single star equally, so some stars will be represented with more films than others.  (And, sadly, Van Johnson does not get a day to himself, but he does show up as a co-star in several films, so there will lots more V-Jo to love!)  The goal: To write a new film review every single day, in addition to continuing to write recaps and reviews of various Hollywood related films and happenings.  I should be busy watching films during August.  I consider it a celebration of getting cable -- and watch I shall!
