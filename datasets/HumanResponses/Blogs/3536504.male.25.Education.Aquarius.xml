						   You are !!!! Someone ?  Sun so bright, like your eyes. Guiding me, throught my life.   Million stars, by the moon. Just like you, by my side.   Heavenly rain, lifed the lands. Like your smile, cheer my life.   Wind of dusk, waved the malts. Like your hand, brush my hair.   Angel from above, came down to earth. And you are, the good friend of mine  - K.Ganesh

						   You are my Friend !~   A friend is a person to laugh and cry with,  An inspiration,  Someone who lends a helping hand,  though friends may not be forever,  And they may not end up together,  the memories of a true friendship will last forever.  A friend is not a shadow nor a servant  But someone who hold a piece of a person in his heart.  Someone who shares a smile,  Someone who brightens up your day  What makes a person a friend?  Is by saying your Love will stay.  Yes, you are my best friend !  - K. Ganesh

						   Love? Friendship?  Friends, We are friends, It’s a start phrase of a boy and girl But, little feeling, growing inside each other heart Both are realizing, Both are Confusing themselves More than friends ??…Question arises… Again Confusing their minds Lust? Love? No more !!! Silence…only silence Hurt….big hurt to both Forgetting…which is really unnecessary Past..thinking about past Fun..thinking about the past fun Becoming..Friends…Friends again Admitting themselves as good friends Confused…in some way Talk..in different way Now  No word...silence Missing you..both murmured Good-bye…to friendship Love for-ever...for-ever…become lovers  - K. Ganesh

						   Misdeed, drugs or doctors?  It’s a temporary Life It’s an uncertain life Milli second, the fraction of minute Precious word, certainly to the doctors They used to see too much of breathless body But, Death, the only word, doctors want to avoid; Inspite of their effort & best pains, Life, rarely, get traumatized & shattered  But its a great wound and red hot pinch to their heart When they are told that they are negligent; But, still, the bound is reached when They are accused of vengeance.  They too human beings, Really not seraph or god. Then why and how, miscalculation of verdict upon their part be called as deception & fraud?  Medicine become more and more commercialized But, as per laws of commerce, It should be well formalized!  Doctors do service and they can sell service for their lives, Its sure, its not against the consumer law Really, the patient is out to find the better ones (drugs) Doctor may better many times, since human error is acceptable, but                                                  Drugs may not be !!! These holes and crevices should be find by government and patients too  But at the juncture of the patient deaths,  Doctors become the criminals by the ever- insatiable lawyers; Society supporting only the patients and they become turned patients’ & drug defenders  So, finally doctors become criminals, not the drugs…. Do thorough check of drug, better, do thorough shun of drug Keep the motto !!! - Avoid drug, evade death, Seek Nature, live healthier  - K.Ganesh

						   A boy writing to his GIRL FRIEND, who have inferior complexity about her black skin !  Complexity makes everything complex !    - Simple may looks complex ! Life may looks worthless ! Two system of complexity, makes life too heavy !   - Superior makes others trouble, but Inferior trouble our self ! Color does'nt matter, when true honest & love glitters !!   - Dirty color is black and also the rainy cloud ! - could u compare ? Life is to achieve with a positive attitude, not with confusion  - Cute smiles in your face, then why bother about the "stars" during the day ? Sky has moon, sun, clouds, stars.....but could you rank those in any aspect?  - Priority is need in life, but life is first priority ??..Am i confusing ? Nothing !....U are a black angel, don't confound yourself !!! - As a friend, I confused your complexity, but I believe that !!! I pave a path to get rid off the "complex" inferiority ("complexity")  - K.Ganesh

						   If you ask yourself !?  Is it possible to know God?  Is there a God who can be known?  If there is a God, what could be more important than for us to know Him, if He can be known?   If you cannot answer for these, you are progressing in your work sincerely.
