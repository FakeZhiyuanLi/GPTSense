      I wonder about what makes a person decide to drive drunk through a cop-infested county all in the name of smoking a joint.  Was alcohol not enough?  Was the company so uninteresting that getting stoned seemed the better option?  Why the risk?  This is the perfect example of why multitudes of females cannot flock together.  Different ideas of a good time.  Different obsessions.  Some obsess about men, others about alcohol, others about "other".

      ....I'm not going to try and remember every little thing that happened the past nine years after I began rigging, but rather just go on from here with all the follies that occur.   I'm currently working on a Hit-&-Run crew that basically does all the odd jobs around the shipyard.   Today, we had to move out of our hangout that housed rigger's for over the past 50 years.&nbsp; With one locker left to go in the loft area, we decide not to send it to our new home, but beat the crap out of it with a 35-lb. sledge hammer.&nbsp; Of course this was not my idea, but with a little PMS coming on, I joined in.&nbsp; We all were taking turns beating the shit out of this poor, defenseless locker&nbsp;when this 20-year-old kid, Kyle, gets his turn.&nbsp; He is absolutely going crazy destroying the locker until he nails himself right in the nuts with the hammer, turned all sorts of pretty colors, then fell on the floor.&nbsp; I'm not a guy, but can imagine that hitting yourself in the nuts with a 35-lb. sledge hammer must be pretty painful.   Since being on this crew, Kyle has fell out of chairs, during a dead sleep, for no apparent reason.&nbsp; Hit is chicken-bucket head on ceiling lights (he's 6'5").&nbsp;&nbsp;And now this current stunt.&nbsp; I don't think the child will make it to legal drinking age.

       Crouching on the edge of reason, just beyond rationality, this faery is the provocateur of restless nights and erotic dreams.&nbsp; She is the one who ensnares us with compulsions, fixations, feverish imaginings.&nbsp; Yet within the dark tangle of images she weaves are the glittering threads of our own healing--for even as she conjures our compulsions she holds out the ability to release their grip, enabling us to confront and let go of all that we no longer need.    &nbsp;  ---Excerpt from GOOD FAERIES/BAD FAERIES

      During my childhood, a majority of my friends parents (referred to as Yardbirds) worked for Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNS).&nbsp; These kids were often teased due to what their parents did for an occupation, which included such jobs as welders, pipefitters, shipfitters, and riggers.&nbsp; I too joined in the bantering because their parents would come home from work filthy and smelled of diesel fuel and oil.&nbsp; Their faces were smudged with grease and had calluses covering both their hands and feet (steel-toed boots are not "feet friendly").&nbsp; They had bad hair-dos, wore overalls, and flannel shirts.&nbsp; Never in my wildest dreams would I have succumbed to such an occupation, or so I thought.   I remember my father having me and all my sisters take the test to join the shipyard's Apprenticeship Program back when I was 18 years old.&nbsp; My one sister, who was a single-mom of two children, jumped&nbsp;at the chance, my other sister and I were urged to, which we did with reluctance.&nbsp; A couple weeks after the testing was completed we all got our letters that my father was impatiently waiting for.&nbsp; My oldest sister scored the highest (102% with 10 extra points added for being a disabled veteran), my middle sister failed to no one's surprise since she was asking us what a fraction was the night before the test, and I passed with decent scores (86% with 70% being passing).&nbsp; After you receive these scores, you submit them to the different shops of the yard that you desire to enter.&nbsp; My eldest submitted to all of them, my other couldn't submit at all, and I told my father "I not doing it, I'll NEVER be a shipyard worker", which was the end, or so I thought, of the whole thing.   Funny enough, seven years later with a few low-paying crappy jobs under my belt, I re-applied.&nbsp; I was eight months pregnant and the application administrators looked at me as if I were insane, but I knew the process took a long time and the window of opportunity was now.&nbsp; After seeing my sister (still a single mom) purchase a home, buy a new car, and live well with barely a child-support check, I was all for taking another look at the shipyard.   I re-took the test, receiving a 97%.&nbsp; This really helped.&nbsp; I had my choice of 12 different careers to choose from.&nbsp; Why did I pick rigging?&nbsp; It was a new field for women at the yard.&nbsp; The Rigging shop was the last of a dying breed of "Men Only" type occupations.&nbsp; The men who interviewed me told me that with the aid of mechanical advantage (i.e. chainfalls, shackles, air hoists, cranes, winches) anyone could lift anything.&nbsp; Both breaking ground on a new field for women, as well as moving the impossible interested me enough to make it my top choice.&nbsp; A few weeks later, I got the call.&nbsp; Apparently, they chose me as well.&nbsp; Along with 11 other people I became part of the&nbsp;Class of 1999 Rigger Apprenticeship at Puget Sound Naval shipyard.&nbsp; So, there I was, the mother of a beautiful 16-week old son and the 19th woman to become a Rigger at PSNS.  Boy, was I in for an eye-opening experience...

      Whoo woo! My dog placed in a contest! It was a Fat Dog contest at a local festival called Fat Dog Tuesdays. He got 3rd Honorable Mention (basically 6th place), but nonetheless, he beat out about 30 other dogs and won a gift certificate to PetCo, a dog treat (like he needs more food), and a Fat Dog Tuesday piggy bank shaped like a fat dog. I'm so proud of him and his chubby little butt.  He's a German Shepard mix breed that should be weighing in at 80-85lbs. He currently weighs 115lbs. YIKES! I put him on a diet last year and he gained 4lbs. I just don't get it. A buddy who works at a vet says he may need his blood drawn to see if he has a thyroid problem. Who knew it could happen to dogs. I always thought it as an excuse for people as to why they're overweight....LOL.  Anyways here's a couple pics and we had a nice time at the festival.
