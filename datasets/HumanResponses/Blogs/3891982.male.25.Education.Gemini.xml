      newest reason to whine y'all.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I can't seem to find any posters of Kate Beckinsale that are worth buying.&nbsp; Its either the poster size is too small or the pose/ clothing/ hairstyle on her is so wrong, that she doesn't look as hot as she should.&nbsp; yuck. yuck. suck. fuck.&nbsp;&nbsp; anywho, this is the end of this whine.

      yo. here's a new reason for me to whine.  i was up in Sonoma from July 10 to July 11 for the Drifting event at Infineon Raceway.  Anywho, the drifting was hot. the breezies was hot too.  but what was really hot, was the weather....so hot, that I, in a complete blonde bimbo moment, forgot to use suncreen.  It was so hot that SPF 15 would have been useless.  you don't need to imagine that kind of heat, it will only fry your neurons.

      There is stress relieving, mind refreshing, attitude changing yoga...and then there's crappy yoga.  Before I go smashing on any particular yoga, which I won't do...you must realize as I began to realize, there are plenty of different types of yoga.   What I call Crappy Yoga might be perfect for someone else.   Anyhow, to the important reason why I am writing (lest you forget, I'm writing because I want to whine!)...I am going to officially start the whine, right now.  This particular type of Yoga just plain sucked.  There are many reasons why...this yoga course today, I swear it felt like elementary stretching exercises.  Breathing, especially deep breathing was not emphasized...I was not able to get into a TRANCE...and when the class was over, I did NOT get my natural HIGH.   I spend my money to get my natural high.   Well, I will continue to sample various types of yoga.  Until, then...whine ON and ON and ON and ON.

      Well, well, well.   Looking for employment is a great reason to whine.  Plenty of reasons why, I don't care too much for the entire corporate hiring system.  Its really amazing how a recruiter or human resource manager can "really" get to know you from a 30 minute interview.  I can lie right out of my asshole...and shit out a shit load of bullshit.  But does that make a job interview fun or interesting? Of course not.  These recruiters I bet are wonderful people outside of their work...but when they base hiring on a resume and a 30 minute interview...does that allow philosophers like me and other "unique types" to get a fair shot?  I should not be penalized for answering the question honestly.  Example:  they had a question regarding leadership.  The answer they want to hear goes something along the lines of " I believe I am leader because of such and such qualities"...the answer that I believe is much more honest is " that I believe I can be a leader but currently I am not suited for that role because of such and such reasons"...I am being honest with the fact that I am not suited for leadership...only by gaining valuable experience and wisdom should a person be a leader...a person should be given leadership responsibilities only if they have a proven track record.  Since I truly do not have a proven track record of leadership abilities I answer the question with honesty...anywho, this whine can go on forever. but it will stop right here.  bye bye.
