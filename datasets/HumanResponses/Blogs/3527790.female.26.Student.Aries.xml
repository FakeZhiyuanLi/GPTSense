      Whoops!

      Unspoken By Christabel Germain  Words gone missing. So much to say. Maybe take a picture?  Capture the uncapturable Find the hidden treasure Discover a forgotten land  Desire Longing Passion  Ears long For the tongue’s Sweet Whisperings  Flip open the photo album It’s obvious there No barrier of white pearls to pass No fear to overcome  Music plays havoc Silence haunts  Dreams are tied Two lives

      Souvenir By Christabel Germain  Skin on fire, Flames of remembrance, Flickers of the future Smoke curling round me Inescapable  Heart racing Neck in neck across the finish line Photo finish Beats a tattoo against my ribs Breathtaking  In the darkness behind closed lids Images flash of    Lips     Eyes    Arms    Toes Transport me  Warm. Dark. Moonlight through the glass pane Illuminate the rock against which Rolling waves erupt.  Fix a portrait in me Lines memorized Blindfolded; vision remains whole  Etched on the surface of my skin

      Unfulfilled By Christabel Germain  Longing  Desire All spin round Eagerly I grasp out,  Longing to touch,  Change dreams to reality    The storm rages on Wind whips me pushing me in directions I hadn’t planned. The view is amazing,  but now that I’ve had a taste I want more Not satiated Pinning Shadows dance on the wall taunting me I wish to follow  AND  Yet fear is there  Dark and ominous  Threatening to tear photograghs off the wall Rip pages out of my favorite story History dribbles from its teeth Perception hides under its dirty nails Lies unspoken hidden in its eyes  Courage now dear “nothing ventured— nothing gained” Adventure waits behind fear’s threats One step at a time Double or nothing  I’ll hold your hand

      Then Suddenly By Christabel Germain  Lightning dance intricate steps,  Across the darkness of my mind.  Its light briefly illuminates,  Shadows,    Of friends I knew long ago.  Silhouettes,     Of places I visited before.  A switch is flipped, Dusk falls. A faded memory Imprinted on my brain.  Wishing to ignite the shadows, Wanting to brighten the silhouettes My fingers twitch in anticipation. An empty surface waits.

      Uncharted By Christabel Germain  Dreams haunt Truth is silent Hearts yearn for knowledge Mind is willed silent  For a glimpse of the future To know what follows Silence roars loudly   To inquire means Knowledge imparted Positive or negative  Spun off the axis Destruction ensues.  Truth may yet be unknown Silence may be uncertainty To press for knowledge Could push the axis off even further  Impossible task Waiting In a land of unknown hearts Much is required of heart, body, mind, and soul.  Is the cost too high? Should the task be abandoned? Can this course be altered?

      Inconceivable By Christabel Germain  Standing on the edge of uncertainty  Stranded  By selfish desires  Seeking  For companionship  Struggling   To float an iron battleship In a bathtub  Assistance required  Stammering  With indecision  Shadowed   By a pleasant past  Stiffly  Utters words  Hot water Trickles Down to a familiar path  Sudden detour taken Round the corner Of upturned lips

      Rude Awaking By Christabel Germain  Some stranger is disappearing down The street with my memory of you face.  A thief. Had slipped in,    Uninvited,    And unnoticed.  A shadow cast across    The wall, Filled with happy photographs    Of you and me.  Crept behind us in every room    Of our house.  I never saw him there. Or heard his    Feet on the stair.  Blinded by a box,    He stole your hand. Deafened by volume control.    He led you out.  The crash of the    Door altered me some And I looked up, But, the shadow was gone.  From alley to avenue    I searched. You, I could not find.  It was only then that I realized,  I had a hand in your hurting The white house sits as still as  A vessel at anchor, lighted rooms  Emptied of you belongings

      Midnight By Chirstabel Germain  Black with snatches of white, Soft and gentle,    With concealed impotent claws.  Two yellow eyes    Peer at me, His mouth opens    And he cries  I do not speak his language,  He slinks away,    Tail down Slowly he cocks his    Head back towards me. Yellow eyes,    Sad and distant. He pleads.

      Reflection By Christabel Germain  Fixing a loose strand of auburn silk, Together we turn    I, 	Fountains of ink, 	Ulcers of stress, 	And barren white sheets.   She;  The hills roll soft and gentle. Swaying emerald, chartreuse, jade, lime, and viridian. Stately trees    Stretch their fingers toward the aqua sky.  A ray of sunlight, Reflects off the armor    Of an aging dragon; Watching over the young    As they wrestle in fields of violets.  The clicking of iridescent wings    Small winged creatures dart in and out, Between droplets of water, That lazily drip from moss-encrusted rocks.  The silk has again escaped    I return to the mirror,    She bends on her knees, Peering into the silver circle pool.  Restoring order to the unruly locks,  She returns to scampering barefoot, By the aging dragon; to dance round the stately trees, Past the rock and winged creatures.  The wind will reach out his finger, Urging that wayward strand to rebel And fall recklessly over our eye.  Forcing me to turn repeatedly,     From my mountains of books, To the silver circle pool. To patiently,    Tend the capricious silk.

      Lost without you By Christabel Germain  You haunt me now more than ever. Familiar scents waft in rooms you have never been in Images flash between blinks.  Touch  Gone  Never to return  Pictures, records and fleeting memories Piled in the corner  Quiet moments Are loud with silence  Craving comfort and compassion  To feel unassuming arms enfold and hold  No WORDS  No ACTIONS  Just a presence  Return to me

      Bleeding hearts By Christabel Germain  At a crossroad Both ends unknown  One currently shaded by dark clouds  Threatening imminent storms False rays of sunshine Promise brighter days  But they’ve lied before, How can they be trusted again?  Human hearts forgive and forget Stupidly we trust in hope  At a fork  Both ends unknown  The second path, bathed in bright blue skies Light fluffy clouds promise nothing True rays of sunshine Promise adventure congested days   Is there room on that path for me Will sacrifices be made?  Human hearts grasp to promise Stupidly we chase things we cannot possess  At an intersection Unable to take a step  Both paths, laced in fear Eyes clouded with tears, blink back more Longing for warmth of the sun Nothing is promised.  Can a heart heal? Or a mind forget?  Human hearts scar, but bravely beat on Dreaming of,    A rock less path and unending sunshine Reality subjects them to tests and trials.  Strengthening, teaching and preparing

      Competition By Christabel Germain  What if; Reality doesn’t prevail?  What if; Reality is surreal?  Effort is piled up so high Investment is monumental  In reality, Risk is inconsequential, In my heart, Risk is behomothic.  Fear wells up inside A flood threatening To ruin all  At the edge of a dream Gate is open What happens if I can’t walk through Or I get to the doorway an my name isn’t on the list  Desire indescribable, Failure a potential  Quaking  I face the challenge Failure won’t win today.

      Ahhhhh…… by Christabel Germain  Water. Warmed,    By the suns fingers,    That pokes and prods,    Into the depths of the,    Murky pools that; Babbles,    Eagerly down to the streambed,    Rushing to tell stories to the patient ear,    That listens,    As water; Giggles,    Tickled by the grass that lazily bends in the wind,    Barely etching the waters skin as it; Spinning,    Tossed about by rocks,     And pebbles that lie,    In its way. It laps at my toes.

      A Room with a View by Christabel Germain  Four walls,    Constant and conctrictive hold me here,    Darkness concealing their number. Ceiling crumbles    With the touch of my fingers,    It falls dry and dusty.    Brushing past my skin Dampness    The floor beneath me,    Wet and soggy,    Saturated with unspeakable horrors. My pillow,    Sharply angled granite.  There’s a door I know, I just can’t find it.  A crack of light, Breaks into my prison, Biting into my skin.  A corner of a building, A screen for which shadows to play.  The branches of a tree,    Budding with spring.    Green with summer.    Empty with fall.    White with winter.  Through this crack,    My world.  Night falls… Darkness  Four walls,    I think. Ceiling crumbles     With the touch of my fingers. Dampness    The floor beneath me One brightly colored leaf, Escaped form that world into mine.

      The Way it Goes by Christabel Germain  Leaves brightly painted,    Red, yellow, orange  Eased from the grasp of the tree’s fingers Captured by a breeze.  Flirtatious. Careless.  The winded carries the     Painted beauty…..  Down Down Then up And  Down  Until it is dropped or lost    By the rambunctious breeze.  There it lays.    Pounded by the rain.    Covered in snow.    Squished by a boot.  Time passes. Decay.  Spring comes     and the tree’s toes    gathers up the painted beauty’s remains  And at the fingertips a new leaf.

      the curious incident of the dog in the night time by Mark Haddon 2002  When you read as much as I do I love it when I come across a book that does something different that forces you to see the world through the eyes of a individual that you normally wouldn't think about. This is such a book. Written from the point of view of a 15 year old autic boy you see the world as he sees it.&nbsp; I couldn't put it down...thankfully it is only about 200 pages and so I was able to finish with in a few hours.   The honesty is refeshing, and funny at times. And it makes you look at an all to common event through the eyes of an idividual who can't understand all the complexities of that event and yet he still manages to succeed in his own goals even though his world crumbles around him.&nbsp; I would recomend that everyone should read this book. It is a fast and fairly light read but one that really makes you think. Besides the style of writing alone is worth it.

      Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert 1856  I truely enjoyed this book. Not only is it intellegent but it is also fun to read. The character's are strong and carry the story well.&nbsp; I felt NO pity what so ever for the poor Doctor Bovary who is unable to keep his wife happy. I loved how Emma searches and seaches for her true happiness and is "brave" enough for a woman in this period to search outside the boundries of her marriage. Women of that time did lead resitricted lives or so the history books would lead us to believe. I enjoyed that even though she met her own demise, partly due to her flighty character and her lack of proper education, she still had her own adventures seperate from the comfortable home she provided for her educated yet simple and unaware husband.

      The Scarlett Letter By Nathaniel Hawthorne read July 2004  Set in the early puritan days this book takes you down a pathway that is rarely addressed when talk about times gone by. What today is normal practice for a large amount of the poplulation. Premarital sex in these day was a crime worthy of death.  Written from the point of view of the woman given a sentence worse than death, living with the shame of her transition. This book opens up your thoughts to dealing with trials that seem to much to bear. Not a happy book, but still a beautiful read from the symbolic and poetic character of the "elf-child" to the ailing minister this book is a reflection of inward struggle and should be read by all who have ever struggled under the burden of a load they deem to large to bear.

It is very frustrating. I'm getting nothing done here at work so I'm going home and going to bed. Hopefully that will improve things!  Other than being sick. I had a great weekend. Spent alot of time outside in the sun!! Went for a nice long bike ride. and long swim on sunday. And then I got sick and I've benn whining eversince! :P

      Okay so I'm a lot hurt by my ex. The one I was speaking about in previous blogs, anyways since march when the drama with him began I have been pretty low. Last night I had a great night. A friend of mine and I had decided that we were going to head to a driving range. So after my last patient I headed down to his place. It was the first time I had actually been in his condo it was quite nice.  Anyways in the next 5 hours I learned so much about this friend of mine. Things that I would have never guessed. We never made it to the driving range. But we sang as he played piano (one of the surprises) had a wonderful diner followed by a great dessert! We talked and laughed the whole night long. It was great. He treated me like a lady which was so nice after the way that me ex has been treating me. He even opened my car door for me!   You know we don't respect our fellow human being enough. Treating others the way we would want to be treated regardless of the station, position, or life stage. I mean last night having a friend treat me the way he did was completely something that is just not the experienced norm! I not taking about being a gentleman and treating girls differently (although ladies lets admit that is VERY nice). I mean treating everyone with respect I think it is an art that our busy society has forgotten. We are SO self involved and busy getting from one place to the other that we do not take the time to stop and smile to the random stranger passing buy. That smile could make a difference in someone's life.  Wasn't it just the other day that the police said they apprehend a man who had the arms and plans for a mass murder here in Toronto. But was thwarted by a friendly dog.  Take time to respect and honor the other humans that are struggling beside you. You never know what the pay off might be!

      Last night I did something that I should have done a long time ago. I snuck into the gym at which I used to work in order to attend a masters swim class. Ok maybe sneaking in wasn't the best thing in the world to do but it sure was fun and there is No way I can afford a membership there!!   ANYWAYS!  The swim class was great. Number one the people there all know me from when I used to work there. Number two they are WAY better triathletes that I am so it challenges me. And three the coach is very helpful. Not only did I get one of the best swim workouts I have had in a while. Let me just was that 10 repeats of your "fastest" 100m where you are supposed to build on each repetition...is tiring to say the least. But I did it. What was exciting for me is the last time I attended that class the coach had me do a different workout than everyone else because there was NO way I could keep up to them! However, this time even though I was slower than them I was able to complete the whole workout which I was VERY proud of!  Anyways I need to get to work I have been slacking off all day...Its been great. hehe. I got a lot or organizing crap done though so that is good!

      I'm not sure if I can really say anything new about golf. BUT I have my very first experience this past Monday. Now to fully appreciate where I am coming from you have to realize that I used to be a golf scoffer. That I would poke fun at my friends who would complain about what hard work golf was. I had the audacity to poke fun of them when they would exclaim "I've golfed my hands off." Well I am here to take back every thing I ever said about golf not being hard or physically challenging! I was BEAT after life the 7th hole and I had 11 more to go. Not to mention the bruise on both of my hips from the golf bag that was over my shoulder. Man I had gained some respect for golf from hanging out and practicing at the driving range, but I was not expecting this!   Regardless of the fatigue, I have to admit that I am hooked! I love it. I mean what a great excuse to be outside for four hours without feeling guilty for just lazing under the tree. I did fairly well too. I scored 117 made par on two holes...of course it would not be fair if I also didn't mention the fact that there were about 3-4 holes where I was 7 over par (hehe). On average I was 2-3 strokes over par which for my first time I thought was pretty good.   This all happened on Monday and I have already made plans to go to the range on Thursday! Yup I'm hooked!

      Yesterday was a great day! I got up in the am putsed around my place packing a picnic lunch and gathering the gear and clothing that I would need for the day! Then  I grabbed my bike and headed downtown. The day was a bit over cast but the weatherman was calling for sun with a few clouds and I was optimistic. The ride down was great! I just love being outside so much. Cruising no ... Flying down Mount Pleasant I was going so fast that tears were streaming out of my eyes and laughing with the sheer enjoyment of being alive and well enough to be physically active!!  I spent the day at Toronto Island. The Dragon Boat Festival was going on and I was there to support two of my friends. One of which is enjoying here first season as a paddler! And to make things even better I got to share her teams first win!! So that was exciting! My other friend is much more experienced and is was amazing just to watch the precision that here team had! They flew! It was great to watch.  I ended up hanging out with her team! They are a GREAT bunch of people. We ended up not getting off the island until 9:30ish and then went to Marche for eats! I didn't make it home until midnight!  But what a great day! There is nothing like living life!

      Just when you think that a ghost of someone who is longer in your life, they pop up out of no where and surprise you!  Sometimes it is a GREAT surprise. Some times it is some whom has merely drifted away as life paths took you both in separate directions and then suddenly something brings you both back together. I had diner last night with a good friend of mine whom I haven't seem in WOW almost a year! It was great. It was like no time had past between us. The only evidence that we haven't been seeing each other or a regular basis was the pile of stories that we had to tell one another. But the trust, respect, love was still there unchanged. So nice!  Other times it is not such a great surprise. Sometimes the life paths were interrupted by an unacceptable action on one persons side. Then their guilt resurfaces and then attempt to make contact with you. Yeah you guessed it  my ex had the never to email me from Budapest where he and his "new"old girlfriend are! It left me shaking fighting back tears. Just when I thought I was beginning to beat that ghost out. Now all the feelings come flooding back and I feel like I have to start all over again. It sucks to love someone who doesn't love you.

      Okay so I recently aquired a bike (mountian) and this morning was my first time riding it. Normally I ride a Miele Racing bike that is about 5-8 years old and has a few problems. (doesn't really shift gears that well) The recently aquired mountain bike does not have this problem! Hills are easy when you have gears that you can work through. I think I'm going to take my race bike into the shop and see what can be done and how expensive that will be. So that I can have gears!! Maybe it'll make a difference in my race time?? Time will tell.

      Good morning!   It sucks to wake up in and not be able to get back to sleep especially when you roll over and see that the clock says 6:30. So here I am in the office at 8:39am. Hopefully this means I'll get lots accomplished today but.... So far all I've manged to do is email, chat and blog.  I have to attack my mountain of data today. Hopefully get before and one month data points for one kinematic test done today. I'd also like to get the coreection factor firgured out for my can data. But we'll see.  I'm just gald to actually have not just one data point but two!!! VERY exciting!

      There is nothing like coming in to the office/lab on a Monday morning and being absolutely exhausted from your weekend. I love that feeling. See I like to play so hard on my weekends that I actually use my week as rest for the upcoming weekend! hehe  I think the highlight of my weekend was the Rick Hansen Roll for Hope event. OKAY so it wasn't I race, but I raced it and for the first time in my life I crossed the finish line first. So that was very exciting!!  following that 10km bike ride I then did a training bike ride of 30km My Triathlon is coming up soon and I need to whip my bottom into shape if I am going to beat my previous time! Weight training today and maybe a short run...see how my knee holds up.  I think my favorite bit was my volunteer work. I'm helping with a therapeutic riding group and I have so much fun. The little guy that I am working with is really starting to respond well to me! I love that. He is getting better and better on the back of the horse. We even had him posting in rhythm ...Okay so it was only for 10sec at a time, but... He is getting much more confident on the back of a horse!!! Hopefully soon we'll get him to post with reins in his hands!!! Anyways I need to get to work! ahhh too much to do!

      Sometimes .... well okay pretty much for me anyways the last 4 months of my life had been some of the hardest. I have been working away at my masters project with noreward or without seeing any thing being accomplished. Which gets even an eternal optomist like me down.  and then  Something goes right. I don't have the data to back the observation figured out yet. But that will come with time. But the observation was so stunning that if this trend continues it has the potential to change me life path! Which is crazy on one side, but on the other it means I find myself questioning things that I though I had figured out.  I feel like I am trying to decide between two of my favorite things. Both will result in a life where I think I'll be able to achieve my dream but...both are SO different and both are mutally exclusive. So How do I know which one to chose?? How will the decision affect me? Where do I go for this kind of advice?

      Well it is finally here the hot humid, smoggy season of a Toronto summer!! I've been looking forward to this all spring long. And now that it is here I spend the first whole warm day inside.   I think that is the fate of my summer though so I might as well get used to it! I have to decide whether or not I am going to swim a 2km leg of a half ironman this fall. I'm a bit scared and worried about who I'll train with. I need someone to do open water swims with me. But the more I think about it the more I want to do it!   I got my laptop and desktop so that they are the exact same which is nice. Now I won't have to drag me latop downtown anymore!! Just put all my files on a memory card and away I go!!! Yahoo!! I'm actually pretty excited about this development!  Now for a bit of reflection:  Communication is so essential to a relationship and I'm not just talking between those who are married or who have life partners. No I'm talking about any relationship between two human beings. If they are going to have any kind of successful interaction they must communicate. Now You might be saying...No sh*t Sherlock! But look at it from my point of view. I have been dumped, cheated on and lied to by my ex -- Again nothing novel--to make matter more interesting I work with him. Yes you read that correctly, I work with him. I committed the cardinal sin. But in my defense we don't really work together we are both grad students with the same lab space (we share a supervisor) but are in different department and have different projects. However now that we are no longer together it has been brutal to say the least...Especially since he wants "to have me in his life still." because of the manner and reason for which we broke things off I don't trust a word that comes out of his mouth. Okay so here's my revelation we are both struggling to thread together a relationship (for me one so that I can sit in the same room as him and not cry and he...Who knows he won't tell me, but that is not my point) but because I don't trust what he says and he has a tendency to lie -- which I now point out. We can't come to that point were we relax enough in our communication to actually say things that are either not hurtful or defensive. So is there any hope of reconciliation......  Probably not but like a stupid hopeful human I try.

      I'm not sure if anyone out there is reading my rants but I have fun writing them!  This one will relate to all of you who run. I'm not just talking the 50 meter dash to the bush as it is pulling away. No I am talking about all of you who get out there on a regular basis and pound the pavement. Now unlike a "motivational speaker" who told me that you are not a REAL runner unless you run a marathon. I salut all of you who run on a regular basis. Whether it is a 2km or a 42.2 km run! All you you should be proud for pushing yourself that hard to get your butt up off the couch and out into the world.   As a runner I salute you all.  Why am I going off about this. Well recently I injured myself running my second half and somehow I managed to struggle through the rest of it and let support that I recieved from the people who lined the streets and the ones who blew by me as I limped along Made me think about how astouding finishing a race...any race is. It is a very visable accomplishment! so congratulations to all of you out there who have crossed a finish line!

      Sometimes it seems like everything and everyone is against you and it is all that you can do to keep going against the contast stream of negativity. Not that the things I have been facing have been that horrible or anything new. But it seems that everytime I try my hand at something I think will end in a postive effect it turns negative!   Hopefully today things will start truning around for me. Maybe not the events in my life but in my attitude! So that even when people or things happen that are negative I can not take it personally and smile anyways.   Who knows...But I can hope!

      As a grad student you have to give a lot of presentations. Now those who know me know that I don't have a problem with peaking and talking in a social situation BUT when I have to speak in public especially when I am supposed to sound educated I GET extremely nervous.  I just finished presenting at a journal club of which I am a member. What a great experience. I mean the article that I presented was not all that challenging but just getting up infront of a small group of people and having to speak in an educated manner. The best thing is the practice that it gives you in answering questions. Thinking on your feet. I truly enjoyed myself. I got told by everyone that I did a good job, how much stock I put in that...Doesn't really matter. What is more important to me is by the end of the presentation I felt more comfortable answering questions about the article even though it is not in my area of specialty. I can't wait until have have my data a little bit further along then I'll present again and get some feed back on my data!  I'm about to head off to a BBQ so even though I'm pretty tired from my workout yesterday. I'm having a good day! And I think I've decided to do the race (Belwood) this coming weekend. hehehe! I love racing! It is a 1km swim so that will be good experience for me to build up to the 1.5km swim at the Thousand island tri on Aug 22!!

      I know you were all probably waiting for me to write about how my tri went! Well it has taken my til today (three days later to decide which of my war stories I was going to tell you.   Let me start at the beginning...I ended up staying in this seedy hotel. It was quite funny I mean it was straight out of a movie the kind of place that a married man would take his lady of the night. The door looked like it had bashed in a few times. The springs in the bed were shot! One of the beds was actually on a downward slant, the top left hand corner was a good 4-6 inches lower than the rest of the bed. Needless to say I wore my flipflops in the shower and DID not sleep in the sheets I had thankfully brought a sleeping bag! The TV had a grand total of 3 working channels two of which you kind of needed to play with the rabbit ears in order for them to come in. What a riot. But it did have a mini fridge and a microwave so I was happy.   Race morning I woke up and it was a beautiful day out and I was pumped to say the least! The race went well. Except for the fact that I got kicked pretty hard in the swim in my tummy which slowed me down. Thank goodness I had the wetsuit. I probably wouldn't have made it without it! The bike was faster from last year by 3km/hour and my run was two minutes faster. I probably could have gone a bit faster on the run but I was being a bit conservative because of my knee.   The things that I was happiest about the race were that my knee did NOT act up at all. And I had a blast! It was such a fun race. I got a huge case of bike envy as nice bike after nicer bike flew by me. But my little Meile did just fine. AND I beat my previous years time by 5 minutes So I was pretty happy with the results.   I am thinking of doing another not this weekend but next weekend just for the practice in the water. But we'll see I need to talk to my friend who lives in Guelph and see if she is going to be around and if I can crash at her place. So time will tell.   I love being a triathlete! It is such an amazing feeling!!

      Well,   I am getting pretty stoked about this race! I have my new wetsuit which makes swimming a dream. I got new sneakers Mizino's. Which are great. I went for a little 4km race yesterday in like 28+ degree heat (not counting the smog advisory or the humidity) and I was able to keep a 5 min km pace so I was pretty happy with that. I just want to do well in this race.   I'm no longer going to be camping in my supervisors backyard. It is just going to be WAY to busy at her cottage, so instead I have to find a place to sleep today. I may end up at a hotel now. I'll just have to see, what is available and what is affordable. AAAAAAAAAAHHHHH. I hate last minute changes!   I had my adopted Grandpa over for dinner last night. We had fun. The food that I cooked turned out really well and nothing burned ...with me that is always a risk and we spent an enjoyable evening together. I have really come to care for him. I mean three years ago we barely knew each other and now I honestly do feel as though he is my grandfather!&nbsp; It pretty neat how people can come into your life and make it that much richer just by being a part of it!   Anyways I have to call umpteen hotels to try and find a place to stay Saturday night in Bala.  I'm nervous about this race.

      I don't know whether it is the fact that I have a race at the end of this week or whether I am just going through a busy time in my life! BUT man am I swamped!! I didn't make it home last night until 9pm and tonight is not going to be much better! UGH! I supposed to be getting lots of sleep this week, but I don't seem able to do so.&nbsp;   I'm going to work from home tomorrow so that I can get everything arranged. Besides all of that I am having my adopted Grandpa over for dinner tomorrow night...Which is just adding to the confusion.   Oh well. At least being this busy is sort of keeping my mind of the race. HA! I can't stop thinking about the race.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am picking up new shoes tonight and going for a short run in them to break them in. Then no work out at all on Thurs. and Fri. I think Sat I'll go for a little swim and run just to calm down....But we'll see.   ONLY 4 Days left!

      Well, it is here....Taper week. Race day is Sunday. I hope that I am ready and if I am not then there is nothing that I can really do about it now. I have been training hard and now I have to take this week easy and try NOT to injure myself or fatigue myself too much so that on Sunday morning I am pumped and ready to go.  &nbsp;  750m swim, 30km bike, 7km run  &nbsp;  When I thought about doing this again I was hoping that my half marathon training would make it so that my run would no longer be the difficult part. However; with the injury that I have been fighting I am more afraid of the run then I was last year this time. The one advantage that I do have though is that mentally 7km no longer seems long to me! So that is good. I make sure that I leave enough in the tank to push trough that run! I want SO bad to beat my time from last year.  &nbsp;  But I was reading an article in the triathalete magazine yesterday that says don't draw lines in the sand. So I am trying to beat down my goals and expectations and to just go out there this Sunday and give it my best. I know that I am NOT going to win, but a faster finish would be nice...But not necessary. I am going to do my best and that is all that I can do.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Well I forced the idiot boy into talking to me on Tuesday night. And since the I've had a really good cry. But I feel at peace with where things are. Yes I still love him. But I know now what he thinks and feels about me. And that is to not have me in his life anymore. So that is his loss. And I am going to move on.  I think I've actually surprised him this morning because I came in and I am happy. I think that threw him a bit. hehe  I had the best swim workout yesterday! It was awesome! It was a ladder workout. There were a few times I felt that I was going to drown and I worked up quite the sweat. But I did it. It was amazing!!! 100 hard; 100 easy; 200 hard; 100 easy; 400 hard; 100 easy; 200 hard; 100 easy; 100 hard; 100 easy. 1500 in total!! So much fun! I was starving afterwards and tired but it was awesome.  I would like to find a group to ride with and then my training circle will be complete!

      So last night this guy that I have been sort of seeing comes over for supper and just to hang out and he definitely like me how much I am not yet certain. However I am not ready for another relationship I don't think it would matter if it was the hottest guy on earth I just am not ready for that.   That is not the point of this blog. The point of this blog is that despite his feelings for me he listens almost readily to me as I talk about the idiot boy. I hate to talk about it to him though because I know it must bother him but he is willing to listen. Which is so nice.  Anyways I wasted the morning at the Dr.'s office but its all good because in 3 days I'll be fit and healthy again! Thank goodness. I was worried that it might interfere with my Tri in July. But I only need to be on meds for 3 days!  Anyways I need to call Molly and talk to her about stuff plus I need to call a potential participant and tell him for the upmteenth time that he can't participate. My supervisor was supposed to do it BUT surprise, surprise she didn't and now it is up to me...again!

      OH my goodness. I mean I had read that a wetsuit would make a difference but I never dreamed it would be this obvious! I went swimming in my new wetsuit yesterday and WOW what a difference. I was having to put in half the effort to go twice as far! It was amazing. I can't wait to see what a difference it'll make in my race times!  I had a very good weekend. I spent the majority of the time outside and exercising so today I am beat but...oh well. I only have this week to train and then next week is tapering for the race. I'm getting more and more nervous/anxious. One of my friends says that I can use his new bike...but I don't have the time to get used to it although if the difference is the same between swiming without a wetsuit and swiming with one. The offer is VERY tempting. I don't know though. I'll have to think about it a little more. Maybe if I put regular pedals on it....  I have to run a long run this week and see how my knee holds up. so far it has been doing really well so that is good! I love being able to push my body again!   Only one week to go til Bala

      This SUCKS!!!  He is there sitting basically right behind me. All I want to do is turn around and shake him so hard. I can feel his very presence. I want him to care for me and be my friend and pick me to love. But the truth of the matter is only the pile of speculations that I have gathered. I only know one fact and that is he has a girlfriend and that I am scum.  So I try and be brave and prove to him that I don't need him and that I don't want him. When the truth is that I am inexplicably drawn to the liar. I wish I knew how to turn this feeling off. People say time is what does it, other believe that distraction is the key. Well it has been 4 months and the feeling has not faded and I have tried distraction but it has only resulted in me feeling guilty for hurting my distraction.  So I am stuck. I feel like there is something bigger involved in this mess and I just wish that the situation would resolve itself or at least come to a head. Instead of leaving me hanging wishing, and trying not to give into the unseen power that I feel dragging me toward him when I am trying with every fiber of my body, mind, and heart to pull away.  So in short the position that I am in sucks!  In other news I got my wetsuit. And I love it! I can hardly wait for this Sunday when I am going to try it out. I can hardly believe that my first tri of the season is only two weekends ways. July 25. I am scared and nervous about it. I want to do better than last year, and I know that I am in better shape but for some odd reason I feel less prepared. It is also going to be hard because last year I went with the idiot and this year I'll be going all by myself! Which is okay...The memories of last year are going to haunt me though!   Screw him...He is such a jerk for doing this to me!

      So much going on in my life right now I'm not sure where to start.  I'll start with the shortest story...Also the one that is a source of sadness and anxiety for me. My ex... The idiot boy previously referred to. Is now back from Budapest and he has yet to contact me which means he is avoiding me. Which even though I know I shouldn't give him the time of day bother me! I'm trying my best no to think of him BUT ....A broken heart is hard to heal.  Next my school life is currently in upheaval. I mean I have tons to do but I am getting more and more afraid that what I am doing is not going to give me any result at al because the project was too big to start with and so the design is not strong! And What ticks me off is that me, who has little to no experience in the research world and has only lately been introduced to the world of spinal cord injury is the one who the fault for the project...If it doesn't work out...Going awry. But in reality it is because I was not very well guided and I was given a project that is too huge! How I am going to salvage this mess is beyond me. In the depths of my heart I know that somehow it will work out but the how and the when is starting to get me down.  Third I'm trying to decide if I should take the MCAT this august or wait until April. I only have two days left to decide and I just don't know what to do!  Fourth I'm SO thankful for the people in my life who support me. Those who do so by listening to my endless prattle and those like my adopted Grandpa who understand that I have BIG dreams but not the finances to support those dream and so he surprises me by buying me a wetsuit. Which by the way is SO totally awesome! I've just been putting it on and taking it off I can hardly wait for the weekend when I can take it out to a lake and try it out!! So excited.  Fifth there is something else going on in my life but due to the first thing I'm not really sure what to think or feel. So it leads to me being confused. Anyways enough prattle for now. I should get to work!

      I had such high and lofty plans for all the things that I would get accomplished this weekend and almost every single plan was left undone. I did something that I rarely take the time to do. I spent some major time relaxing! It was great.  Saw Shrek 2 which was great. Not as funny as the first one, but the plot/story was stronger...I thought and I must say that I quite enjoyed the fact that Dragon and Donkey had kids! That was a great touch!   Saw 50 First dates which I also enjoyed. Very different from the typical Adam Sandler flick, but also very enjoyable. But I think my favorite day was Sunday.   I was supposed to go for a run and a swim plus get some work at the office done, but all I managed to do was curl up on a friends couch watch TV. Lounge around. I did make it to therapeutic riding. The little boy that I work with, he is great! He is responding more and more to me. He will now actually look me in the eye and will respond when I ask him a question. This is pretty great considering he has autism, albeit not very severe. He is learning to focus and pay attention much better. The biggest challenge this week was unteaching him the technique he has been using for posting and teaching him a new way (hand on his hips vs. Hands on the horses neck). Poor little guy it was a little confusing and it is going to take a while, but he started to get it by the end of the lesson!  anyways seeing as I have been super lazy I need to get to work and get caught up. This week is going to be a long and tiring week and I have to train pretty hard as well! Fun, Fun Fun!

      There are just times when you have to take a break and not do the work that you know you really should be doing. Yesterday was one of those times. I really should have been analyzing data but the sun was so bright and my head knew that everyone else was out enjoy the sun and so even though I tried there was just no way that my mind was cooperating! So I gave up and called a friend and we ended up hanging out the whole day it was really nice.  You know you don't really have to do anything sometimes with some people in order to have a good time. We didn't really do anything of note. We got on our bikes and just kind of meandered along not even really peddling. We went all the way from Bay and Wellesley to sunnyside park. There were so many people that we out and I had a blast just people watching. I got a little color (as in a tan...so now I almost look like I have some color in my skin) had an ice cream and just generally really enjoyed sharing the day with each other.  Later on we met up with a bunch of other friends (we all run together) and we went down and watched the fireworks together. We ended up doing to like a 2 hour walk too! SO we weren't home until after 1 am! Consequently today at work I am VERY tired! Oh well it was totally worth it!

      Okay so my ex (aka idiot boy) and I have are getting to be friends again. I know that he does not love me and that he has a girlfriend...But I am really enjoying being his friend and having him consider me as a friend. Maybe I am weird because of this, but that is how I feel. Don't get me wrong I still have feelings for him and some days are really tough on me, but every once in a while we have a GREAT day as friends and that makes all the bad days almost worth it all. Weekends are the worst because I know that he is with her, but that too is slowly getting better.  I don't know maybe ex's can be friends if the situation requires it and the two parties truly want a friendship. Most of my friends think I am crazy because of the way that he treated me for even giving him the time of day and maybe that would be the better way. I don't know except that he and I have a lot of fun together and can totally relax around each other.  I have Lisa (a friend of mine) believes in reincarnation and she thinks that everyone has a past life and sometimes you run into people in their new bodies but they are the same soul. Sometimes that means you get a second chance at something you screwed up or were kept from in a previous life. I don't know that I believe in reincarnation, but maybe there is something to that.  Maybe my soul and his soul are old buddies and that is why we are so drawn to each other. I don't know how to explain it, but we are the idiot boy and I are drawn to each other. Being apart not so much geographically but definitely emotionally is extremely difficult on us.  Who knows where any of this will lead. Not me! I just keep going one day at a time thankful for the happy moments that help me get through the tough moments.

      I did a tri this past weekend I was not planning on doing it, but I am SO glad that I did. It ended up being the best tri that I have done to date. This one makes number four...Not counting the indoor one that I did at hart house. It was in Belwood Lake, near Fergus, ON. The plan was to do this one for the swim only. As I felt that I needed the practice in race swim conditions..All the thrashing bodies and such. And that this one would also be a good warm up to the Olympic tri that I am doing Aug 22 in Brockville as the swim for this race was 1km (bike was 33km, run 7km). I was not planning on pushing hard on the bike and swim at all. WELL, I don't know what it was but I had an awesome race. I hit the water...Thank goodness I had the wetsuit the air was freezing and it looked like rain the few (5% of all athletes) with out wetsuit were shivering like mad while the rest of us were warm and cozy in our rubber wrappings. It was a fairly large and competitive wave (I was in the first wave...Which was weird normally I'm in the 3 wave or later). They had combined everyone under 30 plus the pro's in the wave I was in. As soon as the gun went off and I was in the water I don't know how to describe it but I was just ON. 20 min later (official time says two more minutes because it was a LONG way to the transition zone) I was out of the water. I think that I was SO psyched from having an awesome swim that everything else just went really well too. I placed (in my age category 16th!!! Which I am totally stoked about! My bike leg I was 12th!!!! That is the closest I have ever been and probably ever will be to top ten! Of course I need to qualify by saying that there were only 26 in my category...But still.  RACE # 316 TOTAL TIME 2hours 9min 30sec OVERALL PLACEMENT 275/424 AGE PLACEMENT 16/26 SWIM 22min 39sec OVERALL PLACEMENT 248/424 AGE PLACEMENT 14/26 BIKE 1hour 9min 15sec OVERALL PLACEMENT 282/424 AGE PLACEMENT 12/26 RUN 37min 37sec OVERALL PLACEMENT 292/424 AGE PLACEMENT 17/26

      I am struggling with a decision that really should not be taking me this long! He! I am trying to decide whether or not to race this weekend. And there are more argument for doing the race then there are against it. But for some reason I seem hesitant. Maybe I should take that as a sign?? I don't know. ARGH!  I was going to try and make my self make up my mind by the end of today but now I'm going to give myself til the end of tomorrow. I'm such a procrastinator!  The exciting news is that I am an Aunt! My big brother's wife had their kid. He was born yesterday at 6:30pm 7lbs 10oz; 21 inches long. I am dying to see a picture of the brat. I'm going to have to call an bug my brother. I wish with all of my heart that they were close enough for me to just take a day and drive down to see them. BUT that is NOT going to happen it would take between 24-30 hours to get there. SO...I'll have to wait til Christmas to see the brat! I'm going to go shopping on Sat for him. So much fun having a nephew to spoil.

      Man,  I thought sunscreen would do the trick...However although I'm sure it saved me from being worse off than I am my skin is pretty crispy today. I spent most of the beautiful sunny weekend outside. It was great. Two long bike rides and a 10km run.  I'm really struggling inside. Externally things look okay but I'm bursting to cry. I spent the whole weekend by myself. While that in itself is not the worst thing possible. I'm just lonely. And the friend who has been there for me through all of this (lets call him George) is still there and he still wants to take things further. But I just can't. I don't feel for him that way BUT it is so easy to fall into because right now that is what I am craving-someone to care for me. But he couldn't be further away from where I am.  I hate that my heart is still tangled up, cause where my heart is my mind dutifully follows. So things are pretty tough right now during the quiet times that enviatably come. I hope that it gets better soon.
