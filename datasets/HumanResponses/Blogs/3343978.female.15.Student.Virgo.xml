      its my bday in two months! haha. anyway, i dont really know if that makes a sound, Bri. but i have a serious question, if you liked someone, would you go ahead and tell them even though you know you absolutely have no chance of going out anyway? i mean, like, you dont talk or whatever. no communication whatsoever, would you still want to let them know or would you rather not.   personally, i would rather not and spare myself the misery....yeah i've been through a lot of that so i know. if you know you have no chance with this person anyway, why would you tell them? its a complete waste of time and tears as well. okay well im out you guys. later!   lots of love,  Joana

      liz is making me scared....  ne who.... most important person....  i have known this someone for a good amount of time... as it were almost forever.... they are.... someone i have always been able to turn to when needed.... someone i will never forget... they hurt me so much, they dont know it, but i deal with it each passing day.... i thought i knew them well, but im seeing a side of them i have never seen before.... so i dont know any more.... sometimes i wonder why i still live with this person, and can never turn away..... i would tell them i love them, even after what the dont know there doing to me...   yeah you think you know who it is, but youll never guess :-P

      Wow Jo, you're lucky.  If my dad were about to die, I'd tell him to go to hell.  HAH!!       Oh yeah, the fact that his ship is returning from duty this week has nothin' to do with it.  Nope.  But I swear if he sends me one more %^#@!@* e-mail about how wonderful life is gonna be once he gets home I'm going to send him a virus.  Yup.

      what would i tell them if i was about to die? well i think its fairly simple. i would tell them that if i were to live again and was given the chance to pick my parents, i would pick them. i would tell them how thankful i am for everything they have given me and i would tell them how much i love them. although that will be a little hard to express because i love them so much, i can't even find the right words. and i would tell them that everything i did was for them. =)

      okay that was a good question dane!  anyway, the most important person in my life is..well actually there's two and i dont want to go all cliche on you but they are my parents. well if it wasnt for them, where would i be right? duh?! haha. anyway, i don't know if i know them as much as i thought i do but...i guess i do. i know what makes them mad, what makes them happy, what triggers their anger...wait thats the same thing as what makes them mad right? haha. but anyway, i'd like to think i do know them well but today, i proved myself wrong. because of my *ahem* grades on my progress report, i thought my dad would be mad. my mom's reaction was predictable for me. i knew how she was gonna react. i was scared about my dad's reaction. but today at lunch, we were talking about grades and everything and he was just calmly asking me what happened and he was telling me to concentrate on the subjects i'm having a hard time with. so i was pretty surprised and glad about that at the same time.  this is the first time i've been with my dad for a long time, actually because when we were younger, he was in Guam and we were in the Philippines and i would see him once a year for about a month or so and then he'd leave so yeah. my mom was with me my whole life and she knows me well. we have a really special bond. i love them both.  okay so that's my answer guys. now its your turn!

      hey guys  ok...that was a random subject...thanks dane... (dane- hi guys!!!) OK...ok...its summer...yay... (dane- im tan!!!). well..ok...hes tan...im...well...still white. (dane- and peeling). shut up. (dane- no). ok...i dont think that everyone who actually still checks the blog really cares about our stupid argument. (dane- considering its me and emily.... 50% cares). well...stop butting into my blog entry... (dane- then type something before i get a chance to jump in silly goose :-P). alright...anyway...hows everyones summer been?? (dane- good. you?) OK...dane...stop...your driving me crazy.(dane- i love you too). so...random thoughts...ok...shut up dane. ok...why is the plural of mouse mice when the plural of house is houses????? (dane- i dunno) shut up no one asked you. (dane- yeah you did....) anyways...you wanna hear something funny...(dane- ohoh can i tell?!?!)no... anways we were here at school (dont ask...) and we decided that it would be funny to call my boyfriend. well...we did and dane left a message (dane- the message said that i was holding briana for ransome and that i wouldnt give her back unless i got 200,000 dollars... we then called back to say that he needed to call her and then he picked up and he tried to sell her to me for 1$ then 50 cents then 55 cents and i was gonna buy her into slavery but then i thought about all the hungry children in ethiopia and said nah you can keep her shes all yours.... ok im done... have a nice day... when do i get to interupt again.... never. poo. can i have a hug... please... anyone... yes im talking to you.... briana turn around and give me a hug please.... please.... no hug... :'( i see how it is.... *cries*.... ok heres briana again.... crap no hug....) ok...im finally back...gosh dane. (dane- what no hug) thats right no hug...anyway...anyone reading this would be like...what were they smoking when they wrote this...but i swear...we are not high...or drunk...or anything else...this is us. and sorry for writing so much...but seriously...who else is going to write in the blog in the summer...come on...we gotta keep you guys reading... (dane- considering i am reading the first book on my own will in about 2 years.... crap lost my thought....) hahaha...thats nice dane...anyway...im going to try to mkae this the longest blog entry ever on here...so...any thoughts dane?? (dane- yeah where is my hug... im sitting right behind you and all you have to do is reach out your arms and ill reach out mine... sounds like a movie... and then we can embrace each other for the brief moment of randomness and huggyness.... is that a word?..... hug? *coughpleasecough*)...first...no...huggyness is not a word...and neither is randomness. ok...i think we should call skeet again. that was funny. anyway...so...LaLaLaLaLa...(dane- dot dot dot dot dot doo doo.. dot dot dot dot doo doo doo if i only had a brain.... does anyone know the first half of the words.... *looks at briana* thats a no... um um um. end randomness... and i dont care if it isnt a word.....). ok...first...doesnt everyone wish you had a brain...second...no i dont know the words to the first half of the song. ok...CHEESE NIPS...Get over here Dane...(dane- what i was getting some cheese nips. no you can not have the key board... im still chewing.... never mind...) anyway...has anyone really done anything productive over the summer?? Or has everyone been like me and sat on the couch all day..sometimes going to the beach...which reminds me...we should have another barbeque... (dane- does mowing lawns count?) sure...i guess...(dane- ha and i get paid..... I GOT A 12 STRING BASS!!!!! ITS SEXY!!!!!!. ok end randomness.) Sexier than me?? LOL (dane- i think we both know the answer to that dont you?) Yeah...the bass is sexier. (dane- well your wrong... i still think your sexier... you at least talk to me.... i mean i can jsut screw around with the bass and it doesnt say anything.... it just sits there... i mean you complane if something is wrong... i have to figure out whats broken in the bass cause it wont tell me..... besides..... never mind.. dirty thought... all and all... your sexier!) Yeah...well at least you wouldnt sell me for 55 cents. (dane- *thinks*...... nah... maybe for 3 clones i would... but .... nah not even 3 clones could replace you :-) ) AWWW...WOW...how random is this entry...(dane- very)..do you think that anyone is even reading this?? (dane- i am... well i will when i get home... so 50% of the people other than you that read this will have seen this massive entry of us having a non-verbal conversation...) yeah...(dane- yellow!) and...at least i know that whenever i get sad, i can just look at this and laugh...ok...yep... (dane- CHICKEN WINGS!!!!!)...Ok...that reminds me of a funny story. we made a funny movie called space chicken. and we made the sequel...Space Chicken 2: Space Chicken returns. we have yet to film it, but i think that it will be a smash hit. doesnt it sound like something you guys will watch?? (dane- ok what does that have to do with the price of eggs in china on a thursday morning at 7:00 am at the farmers market in Beijing on 32nd street next to the gong...??? any way i have to go now so ill see you guys later... here is briana for the rest of the page... later guys.) gosh...thank goodness hes gone...LOL...OK...anyways...nows my chance to talk about Dane behind his back...hahaha...just kidding. WoW...this is really long...for anyone who actually took the time to read this...well...im sorry you wasted your time...and i swear, im not like this all the time...dane is...but im really not...ok...i usually am...WHOHOO...i just got coffee...im not sure if it was such a good idea to give me coffee...but...who am i to refuse an offer, right?? anyway...im sure that you guys reading this would like to return to your pathetic lives...jk...so i am going to go now...i would to end this very long semi-conversation by saying that i hope that everyone has a good summer...and this coffee is really hot. ok guys...i'll see you later. love, briana w/additional commentary by dane.
