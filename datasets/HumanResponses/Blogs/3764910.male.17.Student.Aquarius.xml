      It started out quite well.A nice sunny day. That all changed as we planned to go start a fire in the woods. It started pissing down, but we went anyway. We mucked about on the beach for a bit while Stuart sat dranking his half bottle of Jack d's and some jeebs were getting passed. We went back to the campsite about 12:30. Stuart fell over at least 4 times and was going mental, but it was funny annoying him. He went to sleep pretty much straight away which gave me time to burn his hair for about 10 minutes. I'll add more to this, but the highlight was stuart drinking tomato and piss soup and saying " aye, it's dead good *slurp*". It wasn't so good when he found out lol.

       mood: tired  music:  Billy talent  Well i'm back in already. Went to Mcdonalds for 2 Mcbacon rolls and a chocolate milkshake. Milkshake wouldn't come out the straw, but using 2 straws as chopsticks seemed to work well. The park was pretty wwet, but the 6ft was skateable. Almost fell on my face doing a feeble stall in the mini bowl. Andy found that quite amusing. So i'm back home already. Ross might be coming over later to practice some songs for our gig at the barfly on the 12th August. Possibility of going camping tomorrow to Loch Lomond but i dunno if i can be bothered.

      It's sunday morning just now. Had bugger all sleep. About to go to Mcdonalds with Andy for breakfast then for a skate. I stayed up all Friday night/Saturday morning then went skating for 11 hours. Went to blantyre first. Decent skate but a bit busy 'cause all the livi skaters' were there ('cause of the livi skate party). Went to EK and fell alot. Came home, ate indian then slept. How exciting? Stayed up all Saturday night and here i am just now.

      me, andy and andrew went up to our local skatepark on friday night about 7:30 - 8pm where we met ross and got 1/8 of some sort of plant. we decided to smoke some of this plant, then skated. Very amusing. Not going out tonight though. I'm staying at Sarah's and we'll be watching Shrek 2. Been wanting to see it for ages. should be good.  Oh yeah, i decided to buy a domain name and some webspace. www.schoolofassassins.co.uk A site for my band and various other crap that i'll probably get very bored with.
