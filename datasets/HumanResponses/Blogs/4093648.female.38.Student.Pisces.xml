      Geez.  All I really wanted to do was comment on an entry in Andi's blog. I didn't want to send it anonymous so I created a profile.  Now what the hell am I supposed to say on this thing?

      My answers on the survey below regarding depression and suicide sounded rather flip and I don't want to leave it at that. It's a serious subject that causes a lot of pain for everyone involved. A person who attempts or succeeds at suicide is obviously in a lot of pain for a long time. The people who love them are hurt; they may feel abandoned, angry, guilty, helpless, emotions too complicated to adequately put into words.  Psychiatrists and therapists are frustrated when a patient's depression is resistant to treatment and sometimes they question themselves and their ability to help their patients. Often they feel helpless. When a patient attempts suicide they beat themselves up wondering why they didn't see it coming. They ask themselves, "Did I miss some important warning signs? Why didn't he/she call me? Don't my patients trust me? Feel safe with me? Am I really helping anyone? Did I fail to take this person's feelings seriously enough? Should I be in this profession? Am I failing my other patients? Why couldn't I save this person?"  I borrowed the title for this little piece from a friend's answer to this same survey question. (What follows is by no means a refutation to her response. It just got me thinking about suicide) To just give up and quit and leave everyone else, the people who care about you most in fact, to clean up the mess and try to make sense of it all, is certainly selfish. It's even cruel. A suicide is devastating to everyone it touches. If the suicide is successful the survivors never recover. It becomes a part of their psychological make-up forever after and colors their perceptions of all events and relationships that follow. How could it not?  But clinical depression is more complicated than that. It isn't a simple matter of feeling sad or overwhelmed or hopeless.  Suicide isn't necessarily a decision or a solution to one's problems, or the 'cry for help' cliche we hear about on tv news features that try to explain it. Those feelings certainly are a part of it, a part of being human. There a many degrees of intensity with which people experience these feelings. The period of onset and duration of the depression vary greatly.  My depression was brought on by life circumstances that were multi-faceted and that got worse instead of improving over time.  It isn't necessary to write the specific details here except to say that it was a chronic depression over the course of 10 years that finally wore me down.  My situation was finally bad enough and I was finally weakened enough that I decided to leave my marriage and move back to a city I hated to a family I didn't want to be dependent on and become a single parent again, even though I knew from experience what we all would have to sacrifice.  Jumping from completely unbearable to mostly unbearable. Shortly after this decision was made an event occured that was completely devastating.  Even though I was taking medication at this point I reached beyond my limit and completely collapsed.  I was quite literally a broken human being.  I was hospitalized briefly and then began my attempt at recovery in a new (considerably less than ideal) place.  During this time I had bouts of sadness, rage, hurt, and a sense of meaninglessness and disconnection from the rest of humanity so intense I would have done ANYTHING to make it stop.  I was soooo tired.  I got tired of my own hurt, of my own anger.  I didn't want to hear about it anymore.  I didn't want to think anymore.  Intellectually I understood the intensity of these feelings would eventually lessen, and at times it helped to know that.  But often the 'right now' was absolutely and devastatingly unbearable.  And knowing I had ceased to function brought guilt and shame and self-loathing.  The sense of being a burden to those taking care of me was overwhelming.  I would have given anything to get away from myself, even for an hour.  Even to sleep would have brought tremendous relief.  But I was unable to sleep without medication.  Eventually even the medication didn't help.  I thought about dying constantly.  I just wanted it all to go away so that I could get on with my life. I would have welcomed amnesia. Since I have children dying simply wasn't an option.  At the same time I was painfully aware that I was damaging them anyway.  That the people who wanted to help me were frustrated and worn out.  That relief for all of us was a long way off.  The night I took all of my remaining medication at once was one of those weary, angry, lonely, guilt-ridden nights.  My children were in another city in another state with their father.  I just wanted a break from the persistant torture coming from my brain.  I would have confessed to shooting the Pope if I thought it would make the noise stop.  I just wanted to sleep.  I didn't contemplate suicide.  No decision was made.  No rationalizing.  No concious thinking at all.  I just wanted to sleep.  I took 2 of the pills that were supposed to calm me down and 1 that was supposed help me sleep.   Still I felt trampled and still I was crying.  I shot off an angry e-mail to my husband and opened a bottle of wine.  I still felt miles underground in the cold black pit and I took 2 more of each pill.  At that point all judgment was blurred and it seemed to make sense to keep swallowing pills until I passed out.  Eventually I did.  To this day I remember nothing that happened before waking up the next afternoon in a hospital.  I don't remember calling my step-father, which I'm told I did.  I don't remember a policeman kicking down my door, or the paramedics or the ride to the hospital in an ambulance.  I don't even remember my son sitting with me in the emergency room, hugging me and crying.  He tells me I was quite awake and annoyingly animated and charming.  I wouldn't know.  He has reported that the ER doctor was frustrated that I repeatedly pulled the i.v. out of my arm.  I kept asking him where he went to medical school and what he thought of his training there.  Where did he do his residency and why did he choose emergency medicine?  Did he feel confident it was the right decision for him?  At that moment he probably had his doubts.  I don't remember any of this conversation, or drinking charcoal or anything else they did to keep my heart from stopping or my lungs from giving up.  In my case there was mental illness involved.  The concensus is Bipolar Depression - by all accounts powerful stuff.  But it isn't at all clear, even to the professionals, if illness exacerbated my reaction to circumstances or if circumstances caused the illness.  Brain affects perceptions that affect experiences.  Experiences rewire the brain that will do the perceiving.  What is clear is that doctors and family members didn't 'cause' what happened.  There is noone to sue.   There is a lot going on inside our heads that nobody understands yet.  Nobody should be expected to understand it all.  It is entirely possible that the human brain is so sophisticated that it isn't sophisticated enough to comprehend everything it does, let alone why.   And there are universal thoughts and feelings and ideas, but no 2 minds experience the world exactly the same way and not everyone brings the same skills to the table. "You should"s and "it can't be that hard"s are not really fair to anyone.  None of us is in a position to weigh in on what should be easy or natural to another person.  But that's a whole other topic.  (And in my opinion a fascinating one.)  So for now I salute all of your brains.  They're working hard out there and doing a remarkable job.

The people around me know I will always try to see their side of the story and will always hear them out.  In trying to be understanding or trying to show confidence in people's ability to change I often open myself up to being hurt again in a situation where most others would have already washed their hands of that person.

Actually that's not fair. It's been a long time since I felt generally and all-around happy, but happy moments happen all the time. Even in the middle of 'generally' tough times. Take your happiness where you can. It all counts. 15. Have you ever thought about suicide: Yeah, when I woke up in hospital pooping out the charcoal they made me drink the night before after the paramedics found me in the middle of my living room floor.  (Yes, I had actually swallowed all the medication in my house and washed it down with at least half a bottle of port.) 16. Have you ever had an eating disorder: no. 17. Have you ever been depressed: yes, but only for eleven years. 18. What is your biggest fear: That I'll get sucked into a severe depression and it won't ever go away. That or psychosis. It would be really scary to not know for sure what is real. To not be able to trust your own senses, your own mind. 19. Have you ever had a broken heart: yes. 20. Do you ever hurt people intentionally? No. Only small animals. Is that a bad thing? 21. What is one thing you cannot stand: being lied to.

       A book on journaling that I found the other day has a lot of great suggestions for how to effectively use your journal (or blog) depending on your goal. Lists of 100 sounded pretty interesting. The list can be 100 places I want to visit, or 100 foods I dislike or 100 songs I love, or something more self-therapyish like 100 excuses I use for not changing my life, or 100 people who care about me, it can be a list of anything.       The idea is to write as quickly as you can and keep going until you get to 100. List are good for         clarifying thoughts    identifying problems or patterns    brainstorming solutions    getting past the obvious    gathering information quickly    focusing attention on what's  really  going on    filling up space in your blog    According to the book, the first 33 will be predictable, the second 33 or so may be repetitive or show a them, and the last 33 or so will have most of the new ideas and will often get to the root of what is really significant. And repetition is okay.      So here goes. 100 Things that usually lift my mood        going for a walk    reading a book    getting out of the house    talking with a friend    having a pleasant conversational exchange    making someone laugh    having someone make me laugh    reading the posts at Book Crazy    reading with my kids    having someone appreciate me or something I do    getting something accomplished    eating something (healthy)    writing    drinking a latte    drawing    practicing calligraphy    cardio exercise such as running    singing    listening to a book on tape    listening to energizing music    learning something new    taking a shower    finally understanding something I've been struggling with    meeting new people    having a clean house    getting out in the sun    getting dressed up    putting on make up    Getting involved in a good magazine article or non-fiction book    going to the library    wandering around a book store    getting something exciting in the mail    buying a new book    getting new clothes that look good on me    hearing from an old friend    visiting a museum    learning something interesting    starting a new school year    autumn    cool weather    ice skating    a warm sunny day after a long winter    snow, enough snow to go sledding    when it rains all night    riding my bike    going out dancing    having someone flirt with me    watching the birds    getting reacquainted with the books on my shelf    a really good conversation    playing board games    visiting someplace new    going to a baseball game    shooting baskets or hitting a tennis ball against a practice board (something rhythmic mindless and repetitive)    travelling on a train    driving alone on a quiet highway    having time to myself    cooking or baking just because    looking at Asian art, like a brush painting that has a simple theme and graceful elegant lines    looking at photos that I haven't taken out in a while    organizing a space in my house that has been driving me crazy    rearranging the furniture or a shelf, desk, etc.    finding money in the pocket of pants I haven't worn in a while    floating around in a pool    the ocean    feeding the pidgeons at Zilker Park    playing with a dog    playing a game with J___    watching a movie or tv show that makes me laugh    reading a really great poem    sleeping late    having a lazy morning just reading the newspaper    sushi    planning something I look forward to    having coffee or a drink with a friend    seeing something beautiful    someone letting me into their lane in a traffic jam    seeing the Texas wave when I let someone in my lane in busy traffic    witnessing someone being kind    seeing someone who takes pride in their work    people who love their jobs    contagious enthusiasm    people working together as a team    the Yankees losing the World Series    Seeing a team I like take the lead in the bottom of the 9th inning    watching a little league game (when all the parents are supportive and the kids feel good about what they're doing)    hiking high up in the mountains where you can no longer hear any city noises    playing with a toddler, they're so easy to please    watching a favorite happy-ending movie    really delicious food    doing a job well    making a necklace or a bracelet    reading or writing in a coffee shop late at night when everything is quiet and the streets are deserted    hanging out with just girlfriends laughing and talking    finding out that other people think and feel the same things I do    discovering I have something I'm passionate about in common with someone I meet    Passing out candy and seeing all the costumes on Halloween    Doing something by myself that I didn't think I could do    Knowing I handled a difficult situation well, especially with my kids    Trying something new

      Finally I take a step toward moving on and go on a date.  Then the next day I go to bed with my husband.  It doesn't mean a reconciliation, but why do we always do that?  It's like that Dave Matthews song, "...why do I beg like a child for your candy? why do I come after you like I do..."  We decide that our relationship will be much happier and stronger if we are simply friends and partners in child-rearing, but we can never quite cut the cord.  Cold turkey is probably easier than trying to find a line somewhere between spouses and cordial enemies.  I suppose I should hate him, but that isn't very useful.  I'm angry and disappointed in him.  And I've lost a lot of respect for him, but we've been friends for a long time.  Sometimes it isn't clear where that friend has gone.   It doesn't feel right to dismiss him completely for being a fallible human being.  And when he is supportive and reasonable and rational, I couldn't ask for a better friend.  As long as his shield isn't up and he's not feeling threatened he's really good at being able to see what is important.  He's capable of understanding a complicated situation better than most people.  But when he's ego gets bruised he goes one extreme to the other.  His logical mind completely shuts off communication with the rest of his brain, and certainly his mouth.  But even so, I can be patient and supportive with a friend.  I can just stay away until the temper tantrum is over.  With a husband that just doesn't work.  I expect a huband more from a husband.  From a friend too if it's a new friendship.  An old friend or family member though, you just have to work with them.  But I don't have to take abuse from them.  And I can refuse to attend a pity party or anything that makes me uncomfortable.  Just like I've stopped listening to mom's complaining and I can politely make her aware that she's picking people apart again and I don't want to hear it.  Everything I have ever read about pulling yourself out of depression, etc, says get rid of the of toxic people in your life.  That would be my husband and my mother.  Ooh, I just typed father instead of mother.  I was typing really fast and I typed out "husband and father" without realizing it.  What's with the freudian slip?  Interesting.  I guess dad is a toxic person.  But that was some kind of association between P___ and my dad.  That is worth thinking about.

      The preacher was dissatisfied with how little his congregation put in the collection plates on Sundays, so he learned hypnosis.  He began preaching his sermons in a monotone.  He swung a watch slowly in front of the lectern, and at the end of the sermon he said, "Give!" and the collection plate was full of twenty-dollar bills.  It worked for weeks.  The congregation sat mesmerized during the sermon, staring at the watch swinging, and when he said "Give!" they gave everything they had.  Then one Sunday at the end of the sermon the watch chain broke, and the preacher said, "Crap!"

      Dena posted a fairy tale poem that got me hooked.  I'm reading Anne Sexton's Transformations.  They are 'transformations'  Of some of Grimm's Fairy Tales.  I love the ending to her retelling of Snow White.  Here's the last sentence:  Meanwhile Snow White held court, rolling her china-blue doll eyes open and shut and sometimes referring to her mirror as women do.

       For some reason I've been listening to a lot of Alanis Morissette lately. (ladies, is she Canadian?) The lyrics from her Jagged Little Pill cd have been speaking to me.      When I'm pissed I like to hear You Oughta Know.      You seem well, things look peaceful   I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know   Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity   I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner   It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced   And are you thinking of me when you fuck her      ... Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me   And I'm not gonna fade   As soon as you close your eyes and you know it   And every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back   I hope you feel it...         But the man in that song isn't every man.  I also like Head Over Feet. (when I'm in a more optimistic mood)      I had no choice but to hear you   You stated your case time and again   I thought about it      You treat me like I'm a princess   I'm not used to liking that   You ask how my day was      Chorus:   You've already won me over in spite of me   And don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet   Don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are   I couldn't help it   It's all your fault      Your love is thick and it swallowed me whole   You're so much braver than I gave you credit for   That's not lip service      Chorus      You are the bearer of unconditional things   You held your breath and the door for me   Thanks for your patience      You're the best listener that I've ever met   You're my best friend   Best friend with benefits   What took you so long      I've never felt this healthy before   I've never wanted something rational   I'm aware now...      I especially like the line You're so much braver than I gave you credit for, and You are the bearer of unconditional things, you held your breath and the door for me...

      Okay.  I successfully went out on a date.  That wasn't so hard.  It helped that he is very easy-going and made me feel very comfortable.  Getting out was really nice.  I forgot how pleasant it can be to have a relaxed meal with someone or even just sit out on a deck drinking a margarita and enjoying the view.  It was time for an ego boost anyway.  He made me feel pretty and interesting and fun.  I haven't felt that way in a long time.  It isn't anything personal, but it doesn't much matter to me if I go out with him again or not.  He is a very nice guy, definitely a gentleman, but I would rather keep things casual.  Still, I'm glad I went.

       It seems like I've been living on this computer since school got out.  Is it getting unhealthy yet?  Nah.  I can't go on forever.  After the 23rd I have to be responsible again.  Not that I completely avoided neglecting my schoolwork this summer.  Good habits starting immediately this term!      I've been isolating sort of in general.  That has to stop too.  I have felt too screwed up to be around people.  The only way to fix it though is to get out there and make some new connections though.  I've I'm a downer to be around people will just choose not to be around me.  That won't hurt my feelings.      I've been using the need to get my house and my papers etc. in order before school as an excuse to not go anywhere.  Am I chicken?  Do I feel guilty making connections outside of my family.  Part of the reason I avoid dating is that I don't want to get stuck with someone being around all the time interfering with my new found freedom.  And I know if someone gets attached to me I will spend time with him even though I don't want to so as not to hurt his feelings.  I would like to get out and socialize but I really don't want someone who's going to be calling all the time.  It's time to work on me for a while.      Maybe I'm writing all the time because I'm not done.  I haven't sorted everything out yet and I still have work to do.  But all work and no play...

      He came by and apologized last night. It was actually a very good apology. He said that he was sorry he yelled at me and that I had been very rational and reasonable and he appreciated it. He certainly didn't make it easy. He tore me apart for everything he could think of. But he's right, I didn't rise to the bait.  And I didn't accept any criticism that wasn't justified.  For once the high road paid off. It's nice to get some recognition.  I have a lot of faults but being irrational and unfair aren't among them so those accusations really piss me off.  It turns out his frustration was coming from his parents being here.  It's getting harder and harder for him to be around them. Especially his dad.  All the critical messages he heard growing up, the nothing is ever good enough routine, were torn open again.  So he projected it on to me and once again I got tirade he's afraid to release on them.  At least he recognized it.  That's good news for my boys.  Those are not coping skills I want passed on to my kids.  But enough about him. Way to much of this blog has been devoted to him already.

       P. came by this afternoon to get the boys' karate uniforms and bit my head off.  I'm still not sure what he was upset about. He didn't seem sure himself. He appeared to just be in the mood to find fault with me and wasn't picky about what.  Every few sentences he would change his complaint to something new and by the end of the conversation had criticized me for just about anything one can imagine.      Solving whatever the problem was didn't seem to be the point.  Finding something to make me the bad guy about was his focus. Last night he gave me flowers and today I was source of everything offensive in his life. I'm tired of this kind of abuse. Why should I be his punching bag any time he's in a bad mood.  I don't take it personally, but still. Enough is enough.      I hoped we could be friends and partners if not spouses, but he's not being much of a friend.

      P. brought me flowers today after my final was over. Lilies. They're gorgeous. He gave me a very funny card too. It's a picture of Einstein sticking his tongue out. It has some of his better quotes on the inside.  It was a lovely thought but it was inspired by guilt as much as anything. I don't want to be bought. Instead of bringing me presents that reek of remorse, how about treating me with more respect in the first place? I don't want sucking up. I'd rather have my apology. An apology made all the more meaningful by not being followed up with a repeat offense.  He does love me and I know he wants me, but whenever our lives get stressful and he feels like he's not getting enough attention all the vows go out the window. If he's feeling neglected the usual rules don't apply. Whatever he's done doesn't really count because after all it's my fault.  When he says things will be different he really believes it. He means it when he says it. But the same old poor coping skills and spiteful behavior always come back. He's always convinced that I'm doing the things that HE would do. Then he punishes me for it. The only trouble is, I haven't done anything wrong!  I want a man who is secure enough not to need to blame someone else for his failures or his mistakes. I want a man who has enough respect for me to be honest. Who knows right from and maintains those standards even when the society around him doesn't. I want someone who doesn't hold up higher standards for me than he does for himself. A man who doesn't make excuses when what's needed is an apology. I don't want someone who tries convince the world that he's perfect and despises me because I know he's not and because I'm not.  I want someone who has realistic expectations from a relationship, who's willing to be human and to let me be human. I want a man who who grew up with sisters and learned to respect women.  And if he doesn't exist then I'll do without.

       I'm so glad the summer session is over. Summer was no fun at all. Next summer I will have to make sure I have the kids signed up to go somewhere 2 days a week or so if I take any classes. It will be nice to just do something fun without that feeling that I should really be studying.      And this week will present the perfect opportunity. The boys are having a visit from their grandparents this week so I won't have them at all. I can spend time with number one son (first born, I'm not choosing favorites) and also do some things by myself. I can read! I can go for a run in the morning or read my newspaper with no interruptions. I can sleep as late as I want! And from now on, when my in-laws are in town I won't have to see them!!!      OOh, I could go see a band downtown and drink a margarita and stay out as late as I want. Sigh. Some day I'll live in a house all by myself and will be able to come and go as I please and not have to always bring somebody with me who doesn't want to be there. The children wrestling and arguing in the grocery store won't be my responsibility. Any males who want to fight for my attention after that glorious day will have their own homes and someone else will be doing their laundry and packing their lunches.  If they try my patience they can be left at the doorstep. Some day I too will have grandchildren who can be enjoyed and then sent home.      It's the American (mother's) dream.

       Why is it when I check my mail 90% of it goes in the trash? At least living in an apartment complex there's a trash can right by the mailboxes. I stand there with my neighbors sorting mail and throwing away crap that was cluttering up our boxes. If I didn't subscribe to magazines I would throw away everything but my utility bill. I used to look forward to the mail coming. It was exciting to see what might be there. But most people don't write letters anymore. Or even send cards. E-mail is great but there's something special about finding a letter in the mailbox.

      Finally I was able to fall asleep and stay there. The kids were with their dad so I didn't have to wake up when they did. I slept for 17 hours. Probably could have slept longer but decided to get up when I saw the time.  My head still feels somewhat foggy. When I can't sleep I don't think much of it because insomnia has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. In the last few years I actually go for days at a time hardly sleeping at all. Now it makes me wonder if I really am Bipolar. Certainly I wasn't always. I've got the diagnosis in writing but I still tend to think it's another mistake.  A screwed-up environment can certainly push a brain over the line. Have I really crossed it or has my mannia simply been medication induced? The pdocs can't agree. Some (most?) still believe meds can't induce mania unless BP already is present. I haven't felt manic when the nocturnal stretches hit. Nobody else has seen signs of it. I'm not generally even upset, although this last time I was. Usually I'm more interested in sex when I hit a nocturnal stretch. That's supposed to be a clincher.  I don't care about being "labeled" except that it annoys me when friends and family dismiss my feelings as just part of a mood cycle. Especially if I'm mad at one of them. "It must be chemicals in Cathy's brain. It couldn't be possible that I've been an asshole."  Anyway I'm glad I slept.

       Who knew I needed this much emptying? Now that I've started I can't stop writing. My "real" journal has been neglected for such a long time I guess everything's been sort of backing up. Thoughts, feelings, more anger than I would have suspected.  It's under control now I thought. It's all out now I thought. Guess not. No wonder I've been sitting up all night with my old friend insomnia.      Some intense cardio exercise is needed here. Too bad I don't know how to box. Running would be great but it is sooo damn hot! I'll find something. But tranquil gentle and mindful isn't gonna help me sleep. Aggressive sweaty and collapse in an exhausted pile is more like it.      This writing is helping though. Typing is good since it goes so much faster. You can get so much more out. My fingers can keep up with my brain where my pencil can't. This has got to be boring for anyone else reading it but so what? Who's this box here for anyway? Me! Hurray for me! me me me me me me me.      I can say whatever I want too. fuckyou fuckyou fuckyou fuckyoufuckyoufuckyoufuckyoufuckyou!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   And you know who you are. I hope the cunt left you something to remember her by and it makes your dick rot off. Then you'd have to find a new hobby.

      I've discovered a show on the Science Channel called Understanding. There may be more to the title, that's just what shows at the bottom of the screen when one is surfing. It deals with all different aspects of brain and behavior. A recent one was about brain chemistry (plus environment) and violent behavior.  It's amazing that you can look at a PET scan of a "normal" brain and that of a person with a history of anti-social behavior and see the differences as clearly as you can see the differences in people's faces. But what does one do with those scans?  A defense attorney actually admitted a PET scan of his client's brain in a murder case and got his sentence reduced. Reduced from death to life in prison, so it isn't as if murderers will now be set free. Most people already assume there are differences between most brains and a murderer's brain, don't they? Even if it doesn't start out that different the act of murder must change the structure of the brain. Changes occur all the time with lesser causes.  The topic moved to the possibility of using PET scans to identify which teens might be capable of mass murder. The question is what you do about it if an abnormal brain scan is found. My question is why would the scan be done at all unless there is already some disturbing behavior. And would the information be shared with schools? That wouldn't make much sense. If psychiatrists aren't sure what to make of the results, how could teachers ? It certainly has potential as a tool in a person't psychiatric treatment.  Another thing that blows my mind is why anyone would find a scan necessary to identify an Eric Harris or a Dylan Kleebold. I knew which ones in my high school had the potential. I don't understand how anyone can miss it. You don't have to live with these kids or have them in your class for 8 months to see which kids need help.  They mentioned an incident with one of the "school shooters" that happened a few months before his rampage. In the middle of class one day this kid suddenly shouted Damn these voices in my head! The kid was sent to the principal's office and a note was sent home for his parents to sign. He had to answer the question What could I do differently in that situation in the future. He wrote "not say damn." Parent and teacher signed and that was the end of it.

      I heard the tail end of a report on the radio today (Fresh Air) about Chang and Eng. Evidently their bodies were recently autopsied. I never thought about what would happen when one died. They shared a circulatory system so a doctor had agreed to separate them should one of them die.  Eng woke up one morning and discovered his brother dead. (Can you imagine?) The doctor didn't make it in time and Eng died some hours later. I wonder how he felt those last hours. He had had such an intimate existence with his brother that he probably didn't have the same creep out reaction the rest of us have thinking about being attached to a dead body. Was he more frightened? of dying? of the separation procedure? I should check the library for books about them.

      I ran into to Blue Eyes at Starbucks again last time I took the boys to karate. It turns out his name is Dan. He offered to take me out again. In fact he offered to give me swimming lessons or to come over and watch a baseball game or pretty much anything I wanted to do. He made sure to give me his phone number this time since I didn't volunteer mine the afternoon I met him. Sheesh it's been months and he still remembered me and is still interested.  After eleven years married to someone who didn't treat me very well it's really flattering to have someone showing so much interest in getting to know me. I really needed that.  He doesn't come across like a desperate loser either. He's very nice and he seems pretty bright.  And he's confident enough to make his intentions clear. That is a nice change.  So why does it make me uncomfortable. Well, duh, probably because it's been 12 years since  someone asked me out and in that time I haven't done anything but raise children and cry because my husband is dishonest and throws all standards of human decency out the window if his pride gets hurt. And guess who got punished for his insecurity? And I'm still reeling from the miserable year and a half I've been through. Right on the tail of a mostly unhappy ten years.  All I'm looking at here is maybe going swimming with someone and it feels wrong. After P. slept with another woman before I even moved out of the house. Twice. Two different women that is. Not quite a year apart. Ten years of porn and strippers and I'm still trying to uphold the sanctity of marriage when I don't even live with my husband.  I wouldn't lie about it either. If I were going out with someone else I would tell him first. A courtesy that wasn't extended to me. Either time. I wouldn't go out with him just for revenge either. That wouldn't be fair to the guy and it would be a wrong reason to do it. This guy doesn't deserve to be used or led on. Even if he didn't mind.  Not that the thought of revenge isn't appealing.  I rather enjoy the thought of P. lying awake at night wondering where I am and what I'm doing. He deserves to sit home as my babysitter wondering what my date looks like and whether he's kissing me. He deserves to wonder if I'm in bed with some guy whose dick is bigger than his. Whether I'm talking about him and what I'm saying about our marriage.  But I couldn't go out with someone I wasn't interested in or didn't like. That would be punishing myself. And I'm not interested in going to bed with anyone. It would only bring up a lot of bad memories and feelings. What fun is that? Knowing me I would end up crying.  But getting out of the house and spending some time with someone who wants to spend time with me would be good for me. I don't remember how normal people treat women. I suspect if I got back out into the world I would be shocked to discover just how unhealthy and emotionally abusive my relationship really was.

      In the Harry Potter books Professor Dumbledore has a pensieve. When his thoughts or memories become too overwhelming or distracting he can extract them and place them in the pensieve. Then he can reflect on them when he's ready and not have his brain force them on him the way brains will often do. I thought that was such a great idea. I would love to be able to take troublesome thoughts out and store them somewhere so that I could get on with my life and get things done.  I've never been good at banishing my thoughts to the back of my mind where they won't get in the way. They are much too persistent.  The more emotionally charged the memory the more insistantly it taps on my shoulder demanding attention. The idea of plucking it out and locking it in a box sounds like heaven. Like an annoying dog that won't go lay down when you're trying to get something done. You can put it outside. But the thoughts in the pensieve can't howl and disturb your neighbors.  If someone can figure out a way to make a pensieve the whole psychiatric industry would go bust.

      Okay. I may as well give this a shot. Keeping a paper journal hasn't worked very well. Mostly because I'm very disorganized and can never find it. And typing is so much easier than writing.  I'm not terribly concerned about being able to be honest. That's never been a problem. I'm honest to the point of making people uncomfortable. Sometimes they would much rather have tea and ignore the elephant in the middle of the room.  Being too honest is much more of a concern, that is, since I'm writing whatever is on my mind that means I'll sometimes be writing about the people around me instead of just about myself. We can't write about ourselves in a vacuum as none of us live in one.  So if I write about my interractions with other people am I disrespecting their right to privacy? This being online and all? It doesn't bother me to write in a book that never leaves my house. It is okay with me if someone reads what I've written about them. If I say it I should be willing to own it. But if someone else reads about a personal conversation between me and one of my friends or relatives have I betrayed their trust or embarrassed them. If the situation were reversed I wouldn't care, but not everyone feels that way.  On the other hand if I write about an issue that other people are struggling with then I've helped them to see how someone else feels.  Either to see things from a different perspective or to know they aren't alone. There have been times I desperately wanted to know how other people were handling situations I was going through. It would have been wonderful to come across someones honest deep down thoughts. Their internal dialogue. The world needs more of that. The public face people put on is never helpful and often harmful. Are these theoretical friends and relatives being selfish or just  big fat babies? Is it my place to decide?  And what about me? I could certainly use a table of sorts to lay things out on so I can sort them and try to make sense of them.  And go back and reflect on them later when I'm in a different frame of mind. Getting feedback from other people would be so helpful.  Let's just see how it goes.
