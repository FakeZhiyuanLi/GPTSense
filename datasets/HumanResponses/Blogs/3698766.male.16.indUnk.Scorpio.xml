      u know usually my thoughts r on myself and ways to get laid but for once there has been something else on my mind.(actually i should say someone else). I'm sure u like 2 ppl who actualy read this thing know who im talking about. D'mari. well its all my fault that all this stuff is happening to her. it is also my fault that her and hunter broke up. and its all because i couldn't see passed what i wanted. but now all i want is for her to be happy even if it is without me so here u go ppl. my thought for the day.

       well this sux. the other night one of my friends showed up over at my house drunk out of her mind. since she is prego i thought i should help her out. so i jumped out my window and did the best i could. when i got home my mom had noticed i was gone and locked my window so i had to come in through the front door where she was waiting for me. at first she didnt believe me about it then i finnally managed to to believe it. well i almost got grounded more but she was being kinda kewl about all of it so hopefully i can manage to get myself ungrounded some how and then i can go see a certain someone (hehe). well ill see u guys later.
