      hm, how exciting, a "blog", or whatever these yokes are called.

it's been a funny day so far. It's a bank holiday here in england apparently, so the university aint open today. this is annoying as my laptop is currently acting the goat - it wont allow me to check my hotmail account. However, the rest of the computer seems to be working perfectly. Even my msn messenger service is working, and it helpfully tells me that i have 7  new email messages, though i cant bloody access them.

sigh. apart from that, there have been people at the house today looking at the rooms to let. There are 2 rooms yet to be filled for the year. Funnily enough, one of them is the one i am currently residing in. I move upstairs in a few weeks, as soon as i get the thesis out of the way..

anyway, so 2 chinese couples came to view the rooms. In case anyone hasn't heard, hatfield is something of a chinatown area, with lots of students coming from there - cos the university gets higher fees for overseas students.

The first "couple" (and they were married - apparently chinese people cant go anywhere on their own..- partners always come along) were quite nice really - but the second were kinda rude - they kept speaking in  chinese together, which was very disconcerting as i was trying to show them around, and hadn't a clue what they were saying...

apparently more people are coming tomorrow. wonder what they'll be like...

mmm, wells that's about all. many exciting details about the progress of my thesis could be written but wont..

      goodness me, time is flying by. A good weekend was had by all. Mr Moran was particularly amusing, though for the life of me i cant remember most of what he said now. Oh well. 
As usual it's been a busy week here - spent monday and tuesday afternoon with edward, not so much bouncing this week thankfully - we're making progress on computer type stuff; he likes playing on the computer, so the fact that we are actually using educational programmes seems to have slipped by him!!! The only problem is his brother and sister want to come and play with it too..... Three little bundles of terror to contend with. Oh, sheila had some sushi out for a snack yesterday, which made a nice change... 

Now i must start preparing myself for friday - taking Jo to see blood brothers (la). PLus we're going to st albans' cathedral (soon to be scene for my gaining of masterdom) for another good old protestant service. I'm looking forward to it really, but i suppose it'll need a bit of adjusting since i've been spending so much time with another autistic child since i last saw her.

right anyway, must get to work. I spent the morning in the social security office - applying for my NIN. Hours of questions and details... I was as always amused by queries about my names - in irish and english - ah hours of fun for all the family.

      goodness me it's been a busy day. I'm busy trying to finish writing a piece on children's counting. Very interesting topic, which i soon will be investigating in nurseries in the greater hatfield area, with my array of puppets and jumble of countable stuff.

I have also been trying to get a letter from the university, stating that i'm a student here. I have an interview next week to get a national insurance number over here. Apparently you need to have one before they confer peerdom of the realm upon one. Also you have to have one if you're working, even if you are not earning nowhere near enough money to pay taxes etc.. ahh the life of the student.

AH well, i will at least hope to have an enjoyable weekend. Am possibly going to an unusual sounding musical-thing in hatfield tonight, and am going to see dylan moran tomorry in london. Haven't been up in london since way before easter, so will be up there early doors in the morning (on the first post).

      Our landlord called over last night. As ever, his strong greek accent ensures you're never quite sure what he's saying... He's trying to sort out rent etc. for next year, as cam is also possibly planning to stay on next year and do a masters'. He also mentioned his plans for renovating the house. He plans to change the downstairs toilet (literally a room large enough for a toilet and nothing else, but which most disturbingly has a window in it... bizarre) into a spaceage shower unit which i cannot even begin to picture. He also plans on sticking a conservatory on the house, though where exactly i'm not sure. Wish he'd do up the kitchen.

He also says that there's a girl who's moving out of college rooms at the end of the month, and she's going to be in one of his houses next year, but could she stay in our downstairs room for the rest of the term.. I'm not convinced this is a good idea, as i couldn't imagine the room being particularly comfortable or practicable - it's right beside the kitchen for one... Also we have enough fun with just the 1 shower with 5 of us, another cook would surely spoil the metaphorical broth.

but sure we'll see what happens.

      goodness me,

i forgot about this thing entirely.. So much for good intentions. I did have some notion of engaging in more healthy physical activities at some stage as well... Oh and learning to cook complicated dishes. I'm sure these things will come in time.

 It's been another quiet day. I'm trying to write a literature review to lay out my plans for further (any) research on how preschool children learn to count. Very little progress has been made, as always. Writing's a bit of a trial at the minute for me - hence i'm back using this blog!

      goodness me, it's been a quiet week or 2. Busy with work as always - i've ben setting up an experiment, and liaising with a school. Went in today to see what response i'd gotten, expecting hopefully 50 or so kids from nursery, reception and year one, basically aged 3-5) to have brought back signed consent forms. Instead of 50,i got 112.... bloody hell, i will be kept busy right up to school holidays i think!!

Nothing else exciting to report. Will be back home in merry dublin (and indeed in merry mayo) on the 10th of july, only for a weekend though, for my granny's month's mind. Sad to have missed the funeral and all, but it couldn't be helped. Hope she's at peace now.

Anyway, it'll be strange to be home again, especially so fleetingly. Sadly no-one will be round at that time anyway, denis is still troubling the australian natives, eoin is busy safari-ing in kenya, and yann will be in the even more scareifying wilds of cork. deary me. Ah well, i'm sure i'll get a proper holiday at some stage - hope to get away to berlin for a few days at some stage over the summer. right, now to bed

      Well, there's another weekend done gone. I tried (unsuccessfully at first) to go to the musical. Due to signal problems at edgeware road station, i was sat for over an hour on a mostly stationary underground train, most annoying. much running and switching of trains was required once we crawled into paddington, and to my credit i was only about 20 minutes late... Unfortunately they then dont allow people in until the interval. several choice words sprang to mind.. You could go to the lounge and watch the proceddings on a monitor, which sadly was not very helpful.

The black rider is a very "modern" (read conceptual, possibly quite pretentions, relying quite a bit on lights and dance as well as music to set the scene, rather then focusing on what may be called a coherent narrative) play. The second half of the show is basically a slow descent into hell for the main protagonist. Had some brilliant scenes - marianne faithfull as the devil emerging from above the stage, singing in her own inimitable fashion about magic bullets. There was also a rather odd character who looked for all the world like nosferatu, but is actually supposed to be ernest hemmingway... though what he's doing in an 18th century german fairy tale god only knows.

The dancing was just brilliant though - compellingly off-kilter, oh and there was this rather strange black obelisk type thing which seemed to engulf all the characters at the end?????

finally, the show also featured the wonderful mary margaret o hara singing i'll shoot the moon. marvellous.

The rest of the weekend was rather quiet - spent the time in barnes (the h's being on holiday in crete) reading papers and planning for another meeting with supervisors on monday... wonder will i ever get this next research started..

      Goodness it's been a busy week.
Took Jo out to st albans' on friday for mass and a musical; went well overall, though not without incident. She seemed to enjoy the outing and was happy to see me and hear the old stories.

The rest of the weekend was taken up with trying to read up and prepare for a meeting with supervisors on monday - it went okay, clearing of the air and focusing in on details for the next experiment - we have another meeting for next monday which will hopefully bring another step towards finalising plans for this term.

After the meeting on tuesday i was out with edward en famille - an outing to the RAF museum in hendon. It was quite interesting, though i'm afraid that trying to ferry around edward, who was very keen to run around and press all buttons and look at all computers possible, did not leave much room for looking in detail at the different planes and the information given. Oh well, sure it was all good fun anyway.

Cant wait til this weekend now - i'm going to see a musical "The Black Rider" music by Tom Waits, co-written by william burroughs, and for some reason, starring marianne faithfull as the devil/his assistant(?). It should be an interesting experience... But before that work must be done
