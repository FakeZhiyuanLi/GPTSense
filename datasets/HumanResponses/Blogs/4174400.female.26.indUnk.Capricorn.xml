      so i said that i wouldn't be blogging today since my sister is in town- but we decided to stay home and chill before the chaos that happens tommorow when we have to go to san jose. to the people that want the short version of the day--roopam got home safely(after a lot of traffic)--rachana lost her cell phone for a couple of hours(almost had a breakdown)--me/sukhmi got gubber and he's adorable- met his new brother kalia- and they took to each other well.  the day started early-had to drop off my brothers car at the dealership- so many problems, so many things that its not even worth typing them all up. so we go to san jose to pick up my sister- and then 15 minutes away on the 101- BIG accident and me/brother were in a parking lot. we declared it the worst traffic ever(even LA traffic) and we were a good 45 minutes late to pick her up. so we make it back to fresno--rested up- and then i realize hi, i'm missing my cell phone- i try to call it to see where it is- oh yea, my phone is on silent- so no use- then i hope to God that its in my brothers car which i find out later it was--       lesson:  rachana needs to type all her phone numbers in word so that she doesn't have to mass email everyone--this needs to be done ASAP--i realized that my cell phone is imperitive for phone numbers- how sad technology has become my phonebook  me/sukhmi head out at 6pmish to Tulare to pick up Gubber- he was really good on the way to Fresno(an hour drive)- basically slept the whole way and we both realized this may be a harder transition because he was wimpering a little(missing his mom/siblings)--and he's younger/smaller. he met Kalia- did really well--Kalia is twice the size of Gubber and he immediatly became the big brother and calmed down and didn't harrass Gubber-just amazing. Now Gubber is inside hanging out because yea, he's too little to be outside with Kalia-plus he needs to get his shots all done so that its safe for him to be rolling around in the backyard.  so good/busy day--got my sister back in town and a new dog- can't complain. :)

      so today was a pretty uneventful day- didn't do much--had a lot of visitors come to visit Kalia and we moved boxes so that my brother now has a parking spot in the garage--whoo hoo. my brother hasn't moved ONE box in this whole moving process and yet, he questions things now on why we have to do things- i just laugh at him and am like, hi, yolanda/i were the ones moving for 6 weeks and now you're bitching about an hour of work- whatever....  so today- i sold another book on amazon and thought it was the perfect opportunity to write about this topic in my blog since i don't have much to say today. ever since i knew that i was going to move from sd--basically two weeks before the moving date--i decided that i really need to get rid of all my books from UCSD that are just collecting dust and stop moving them here and there. I put them on amazon and i've been selling them for good money ever since then--i only have 3 more left and then the clutter of old books is out of my life--here's my suggestions if you ever decide to put it on amazon or ebay(i sold my sarah tickets on ebay--got an 80 dollar profit!!)  --when selling your used book- if you haven't used it(never opened it)- list it as new- yea, its 'old' to you-but you get more money if its "new"  --look up the lowest price for that book and then go 50 cents-1 dollar cheaper- the cheaper books get sold first and if you're the first one to be listed, more chances of you getting it sold- DON'T go by what amazon tells you-go by the used book list  --amazon takes a good cut of your profit-like 10%--and then they compensate you only $2.60 for shipping--it usually costs you a good 5 bucks(buy the mailer at office depot/walmart costco)--and then because they're big books- usually runs you a good $3.50 for shipping(BOOK rate- muy importante- don't go to UPS store-go to the post office-otherwise you'll be paying $7 or more)  --on ebay- what sold my tickets- using a digital camera to take a pic of the tickets- then paying the extra money for the pic to be displayed when looking at the listing- i think people know then that you are legit and then they trust you  --also, on ebay- what i did was copy/paste someone else's ad that sold for a lot of money in the same category--for concert tickets-imperative to put the venue's map so that buyers can see where your seats are and they don't have to look it up  so yea- people have asked me how i do it and here you go- you know where to reach me if you need more detail- i made a good 500 bucks on amazon so yea- SELL those books-much better than selling them back to your university...it does take time/some effort- but honestly- somewhat worth it...  well, tommorow-sunday- i'm going to be busy with my sister and angie's engangement so i'm thinking sunday night might be my next blog--hope everyone has a good weekend :)

      so today was a relaxing day and i didn't do anything exciting except play with kalia(taught him how to sit- now its on to laying down) and research for my boston trip that's happening next week. it was nice to relax and not do anything for once..so here are my random thoughts... :)  first/foremost- thnx to all my friends/family who have emailed me and said that they are reading my blog and love it--just means a lot and makes me more motivated to keep this thing up to date...  waking up at 4am like i said before- brutal- i went to bed at midnightish to the japanese winning in the olympics and didn't see the medal ceremony--and then waking up- there was the medal ceremony-um, weird--also, the HSN--can i say if i was old and retired- i would totally be addicted to it- yes, for the most part they have cheesy jewerly--but they had the really cool wine opener for 20 bucks- i was almost going to buy it! ;)  canoing in the olympics- wtf--didn't even know that existed and just the way they made it-just really cool  to that little person on 'amazing race'-rock on- i'm sorry you got cut but you made it far(the eggs weren't the best challenge)-i just caught a glimpse of the show here and there- but yea-you were the one that made it somewhat interesting  i was flipping channels and i caught-'the player' on UPN-um WTF-- basically, its the bachlorette--just gone WAY wrong  i'm glad paris got her tinkerbell back--even though i'm not the biggest fan of hers- losing a dog would be traumatic- i was just surprised to see that she was just giving 5,000 dollars for it- i would imagine with all the money she has- the dog would be worth more than that  i'm intrigued now by tatooes on the nipple- i've been going back and forth with if i find that sexy--part of me says, yuck/ouch--part of me says, whoa, thats sexy(like is that the key to your heart kind of thing/turns you on?)....maybe its the tongue ring girl coming out of me  i haven't been able to watch my netflix lately, and last week, i saw that walmart is doing the same gig for a cheaper price- i usually don't support walmart- but yea- totally thinking about switching over(does anyone subscribe to walmart? let me know how it is...)  i miss video games--i used to play a lot with a friend of mine at the time and now i hardly play at all--joe got me into tetris attacks- but yea, its not tony hawk or any of those D&B games  i've realized that when planning trips- i'm now searching more active things--aka hiking, biking, whale watching- why is that? i'm thinking its cuase i remember the more active things versus the touristy things.  i've joined the club in watching my weight- i haven't had to watch my weight for a good couple of years now- and now that i'm happy in fresno- i've gained weight and have to join the club in watching what i eat- NOT fun. i enjoyed just eating whatever i wanted and not worrying about things- oh well- i guess happiness is a lot more important than the weight gain :) some of my friends even have applauded it--haha...  in the past, i've written thank you notes via email- after receiving notes in real mail-- i realize that its soo much more personal and just shows how much more they sincerly appreciate things- i might have to do that in the future(even if its more work)...  has anyone seen 'garden state' with natalie portman and that guy from 'scrubs'?- heard it was good- 90% fresh--just looks like a rachana movie...  ok, thats it for today- hope everyone had a good day :)

      So today, my brother, aman,  jessi,and i set out to sacto to go white river rafting on the south part of the american river- we had a good time and even though it was stressful getting there- we all had an awesome time on the river and it was a great bonding experience...the long story is ahead- its totally a good story- but yea- read it when you have time.  day started at 4am--brutal to get up- but we managed--random things are on tv at that hour- but thats another blog entry. so we headed to sacto- my home for 1.5 years--it was REALLY nice to go back- see sacstate and just reminesce- i called my friend, damian, about directions last night cause i was kinda fuzzy on freeway entrances- so it was great to catch up with him too. anyways, we are good on time on the car ride- and we decide to go to McD's(yes, we were starving...) and then we're on our way again in a matter of 5 minutes- and then after awhile we're looking for the exit- and then I'm like, um, need to ask someone if we're going the right way- we ask a local-ohh, we missed the exit 30 minutes back-the exit was right after McD's...so basically when we were passing the food around/chomping-we full on missed the exit. so we realize that we're going to be late- and we call the company to say hi, we're going to be late- they're like okay, all good- we'll be here waiting. we finally get there at 10:30(after me driving like a maniac in hills/valleys-no service--was supposed to be there at 10am)--and the bus with all the rafters in their life jackets is on the driveway out!! i start honking my horn and the tour guy hops off the bus and immediatly checks us in and we're on our way to raft(barely!)- didn't have time to put sunblock on, didn't have time to really change. we get on the bus--and we apologize to everyone and thankfully everyone is really nice and forgives us. then we notice--hi, we're the only BROWN people on the bus- EVERYONE was caucasian(nothing wrong with that) but then we just started LAUGHING because we were perpetuating a stereotype of IST and just yea, being indian(also, rolling up in my car- yea, NOT a good gig). so we head to the raft- quick safety lecture-our tour guide(picture above) has a nipple ring and a sun tatoo around it- i couldn't decide if i thought it was sexy or not-still debating- but yea- he was really nice and just was a great guide and let us do whatever- the 2nd big wave- sukhmi fell out of the raft- basically leaning the wrong way- just a riot--he was calm/collected in the water and let us save him and everyone was happy. in the middle- got to go out of the raft- make sandwiches and even jump off a rock and ride the rapids on our own with our life jackets- totally a good time and a natural waterslide. made it to the end-all alive and smiling- changed out of our clothes and we were off to fresno. (if interested in rafting-  whitewatervoyages.com -is the company we went through) so on the way back- all of us LOVE hip hop and it was SUCH a nice change of pace to NOT be ashamed of what i listen to and kinda be ignorant on a lot of things that are up and coming. listening to my usher cd and everyone loving it and even listening to the radio on all the stations that i listen to- man, almost made me want to cry. i love my friends, i really do, but some of them HATE hip hop and sometimes i feel like a freak for liking what i like--so yea, just a great change of pace and the people in my car were like, hip hop is life and its fun and if you don't get it- oh well- i guess thats with all types of music. i'm not a big country fan- but i'll listen to it just to see whats up and to see if things have changed...and yes, i did own the garth brooks live cd for a while-just to perpetuate my point :) as for kaylia- if anyone is wondering- he got a great day at home without me/sukhmi bombarding him- my mom/dad took care of him and we took over once we were back in fresno. long day- but a great day to go river rafting. even though i'm tan as hell now- because of the no sunblock factor- it was well worth it.

      So last night, my family and i went to an indian restaurant in fresno to celebrate Aman's going away to UOP for pharmacy school-- lot of OLD friends were there, including people I hadn't seen in years. One of my friends, Angie, just got enganged and my family and i are going to her engangement party on saturday in fremont- and my sister is coming into town for that, so we're all excited about that. It was really, REALLY nice to see Angie since i hadn't seen her in a couple of years and just catch up on our lives. I've met her fiance, since he came to my infamous 21st party with her in SD- hehe - and he's a great guy...so just good times at the party- even got to see my old tennis coach from way back when-mr. mark belman...so that was a great experience also. the first day with kalia was great- just getting him used to our backyard and our neighborhood- took him on his first official walk down our street- he had a great time-encountered two dogs and didn't bark and was generally a good guy- a good sign. also met strangers very well--kalia wasn't too speedy at first- but by the time, it was time to get back- i think he realized that we were going home and then started bolting. i think i wore him out because by the time we got back- the little guy was tuckered out. my brother and i raided the backyard with ant spray cause kalia was getting bambarded with them- hopefully by tommorow, it will have subsided and kalia can move back in. but all in all- a good day for the little one... :)

      Today, Sukham and I went on the prowl for two dogs--one fox red labrador and one black labrador. We decided to name them Gubber and Kalia- after a famous saying in an indian movie called Cholay--gubber says this dialogue--"ab thum hara kiya ho ga kalia'..so yea, thats where it comes from. We're super stoked about them- we took Kalia(black lab) home today--and then we get Gubber(fox red lab) next week because its still too young(4 weeks) for him to leave his mom...another trip to Tulare(an hour away) will have to insue--hehe. Kalia is now waiting for his brother to come home and Roopmi will get to see them both at home when she comes down from Yakima. :)  More pictures:  urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/I.jsp?c=epdclrx.5lvg3ndd&x=0&amp;y=-2xz6oa  and probably a ton more to come :)

      so today is the official start of the olympics--whoo hoo. honestly, my brother and i were discussing it and we were both kinda like, ok have we been out of it?- or has there NOT been a lot of advertising for the games. i haven't been watching tv a lot and my brother was studying for the mcat- maybe its just us. nonetheless- the starting ceremonies always give me a warm, fuzzy feeling inside cause i guess its one of those times where everyone in the world comes together and focuses on something positive for once. i'm really excited to see really 'random' sports--i saw handball today(is that the same one that they play in elementary schools?) -badminton(which they say is going to be on a lot on cable-always was a big fan)-and of course all the other cool sports that are popular- i'm a big fan of the cycling/swimming/diving/and of course running. just the speed and the agility of all the athletes is a pure amazement on my part. i don't know how much i'm going to be watching the olympics- but its nice to know that they're on when i'm bored.  also, good luck to my brother and other 'fools' who are taking the mcat tommorow--i'm so looking forward to getting my brother back to his 'normal' self where we can just hang out and not worry about it anymore. :)

      so on friday night-i went out with my family friends in fresno and we decided that night that we would go on a camping trip to sequoia national park since we are were futzing around in fresno before the school year started- very random- but it turned out really well and a lot of fun...     on monday(august 9th)- we met up at ajeets house at 7am and then headed out to the park- got there at 9:30ish and set up camp- immediatly we went to lodgepole and we were going to go on a hike- but decided to go to the crystal cave and then go on the hike- after an hour drive- we got to hike down to the cave--beautiful waterfalls and streams were on the way so it made it nice to go down there. once we got to the cave- we put on our sweatshirts(40 degrees inside) and got to see all these amazing formations inside the cave- the tour guide even did a cool gig where he turned off all the lights and then showed us how our eyes decieve us in the dark--after the cave- we hiked up and then headed to moro rock--up the steep stairs- but totally worth it- the view was incredible--just a great view...saw dr. smith up on the top- a prof at ucsd(mo bio) and that i only knew through rambod cause we met at TGIF during dinner in sd.  totally random...after the rock- went to general sherman tree(the tallest tree in the world)-very massive and a must see--then went to the tunnel log where we got to drive through a tree(take a pic too!) and then go to the auto log(which was a disappointment)...after this full day, we decided to head back to camp and eat burgers on the campfire and eat our smores-yum.    on tuesday(august 10th)- since we didn't get woken up by bears--we decided to go to muir grove(2.7 miles one-way)-got to see great meadows, some streams-and the sequoia grove where john muir himself explored--also got a great view at the end...after the hike, the boys went to a swimming hole and i took a nap(even though i was scared i was going to be eaten by the bears)--the boys came back and we decided to hike one more time to tokapah falls(1.7 miles one way) and got to see some more meadows, streams, daisy meadows, and a great view at the end. also encountered some deer-which was very cool...i encountered deer at the campsite the day before- but it was cool seeing them out in nature).  after the hike-went back and cooked up mac and cheese and while doing this, i spotted a black bear by the restrooms just walking along--the dogs started barking from the next door neighbors so it scared it off- but the hill next to us started banging on their pots and yelling help- apparently this is normal and people continued with their campfires. we invited some german girls to experience smores- they liked it for the most part-but i think it was too sweet for them--went to bed without getting eaten by bears and had a good trip- headed out the next day to fresno.  so that was my random trip to the sequoias--if you want to see more pictures...here you go...  urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/I.jsp?c=epdclrx.33p73y1t&x=0&amp;y=-bxm6zq

      Hey all- I just decided to do this- seeing some of my friend's blogs and noting that i want to start up journaling--i figured this would be the way to go. i'm doing this more for myself but also for my friends that want to check up on me without writing me an email or calling me--so here it is- hope you guys enjoy- i'll try to keep with it and update it as much as possible--:) Rachana

      okay, so i went to costco today- spent the time at HOME to make sure that all the prints that i wanted to go on the card. a person told me way back- hi, make sure you get the pics at home that you want so that you're not a mess at costco at the machines. so i get to costco- and this couple is at the machine- san diego got smart and put two machines in--but i'm in fresno with ONE machine and this couple is ahead of me. so i stand a little bit away from this couple and start to wait- the chic turns to me and is like, 'oh, we're going to take awhile'--in a really bitchy tone--i just continued to wait- apparently they saved ALL their 220 pics on a cd and were deciding right then and there which ones to print--so i decided- you know what- i'm just going to stand here and maybe next time they'll realize hi, get your digital pics that you WANT to print out on the cd- and not EVERY one--after they were done--(oh did i mention TWO cds)...(and i did think well why didn't they give me the machine first- but oh no- they were not that nice)--i went up to the machine and in 3 minutes i was done- and they looked at me and i knew they felt bad--so yea- i hope they learned to be considerate and thats my rant--just please, if you have digital pics- choose them before hand- just a common courtesy--i learned it a long time ago--but yea- most people- don't do it :)

      So my trip was a LOT of fun and i got to see a lot of people in a short amount of time...first and foremost- to my hosts in all the different cities- thank you-without you- yea, i would be homeless and i wouldn't have had so much fun. to the people that made time out of their schedule to see me- thank you too :)  pictures of the trip are at:  urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/I.jsp?c=epdclrx.6r0e1zmp&x=0&amp;y=wc01zx  (once i figure out the uploading pics on here- they'll be easier to access-but this will do for now)  so if you're really, really interested in what i did everyday--here you go...   saturday, july 24th, 2004 UCLA/Mel P/Jenn-Ryan's Wedding/Leena's House  today the day started off with a drive to UCLA/westwood area to go visit melissa p(always will be in my mind) and jonathan- we went to an organic lunch place- caught up on each others lives and then headed down to 3rd street promenade- lots of fun. then i said my goodbyes and i was off to jenn and ryans wedding( urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/BrowsePhotos.jsp?&amp;collid=298120715105&page=1&amp;sort_order=0 ) in van nuys- the ceremony was beautiful and jenn looked gorgeous going down the aisle- very big and beautiful train and having it in a real mission was fun also. after the ceremony, the wednesday night crew(or mafia as some people refer to us as...) went to the reception--and had a good time dancing and just hanging out. thats where i found out that jaime/danielle were enganged(congrats again!!) and realized that i made a big assumption about things and learned my lesson on listening to my cell phone messages the whole way through--must do that!! haha...anyways, after the reception(at 11:30pm)--i head to leena's new gorgeous house(  urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/BrowsePhotos.jsp?&amp;collid=179711715105&page=1&amp;sort_order=0 ) and stay the night there- it was only 5 minutes away from the reception and even knowing that they were going to kick me out at 7:30am--i just wanted to see leens/ramesh and see their new house.   sunday, july 25th, 2004 San Diego  so today i headed to san diego--and joe was nice enough to house me and hang out--even though it was really weird driving by la jolla and realizing that i don't live there anymore- it was nice to just realize that going to joe's apartment was a nice change of pace. i got in at 11amish and we immediatly went to coronado to soak in some sun. after getting massive tans and really hot- went to In and Out burger(OB was way crowded- too many comicon croonies in town...)--we then went home- took a nap and then watched some movies and ate some thai food from hillcrest--starsky and hutch and secret window by the by- good movies--shocking i know- but i enjoyed them...   monday, july 26th, 2004 San Diego Continued  joe had to go to work so i had lunch plans with danielle at BJ's and then we ran some errands together- after she dropped me off- i went to my favorite mall in sd- fashion valley and trolled around there for a little bit--saw one of my interior design friends and found out that they were remodling my favorite express store i've ever found--can't wait to see the new one(i know i'm a nerd)...after malling- joe met me and he dropped me off at the airport--got into seattle at midnight and was greeted at my hostel by a bum that wanted my money right next to my cab- nice welcome. since this was my first official stay at a hostel(yes, i KNOW--i'm a freak for not staying in one in europe)...i was kinda sketchy on the idea but i really liked the 15 dollars a night gig--and i figured i would give it a try--got there- was a fairly decent place- lots of activity- i was placed in a 8 person room- it was clean for the most part and the girls were all sleeping--only 3 of the beds were occupied--i hardly got any sleep that night cause the window was open and too much noise from i think drunk clubbers were yelling- i figured- okay, one night- lets just see what happens- worst comes to worst, go to another place- i'll be fine--and i learned- yes, this is the way to go...details later to come...   tuesday, july 27th, 2004 Seattle(1st day)  so today, i met a girl named nan from holland that was bunking with me in the same room- we decided to hit up the town together and had an awesome time...we walked around downtown and pike place--Pike place- is AWESOME- right then and there, i wanted to move to seattle. just the big market--the beautiful flower(cheap too) and all the fruit and fresh meat- yea, totally my gig. we saw the old starbucks(disappointingly the same as any starbucks on the inside)--we went to the waterfront and i wanted to go on the cruise and she just wanted to hang out at the water for a while more- so we split up for the hour- the harbor cruise was coolio- got to see where everything is and even got to see the real world seattle house--haha. after the cruise, went to this old ye curiousity shop where they had all these weird things- mummies, stuffed animals that shouldn't be stuffed, choskies up the wazoo...after that- we headed off to pioneer square where we went on the famous underground tour--my camera battery died so i didn't get shots of this but apparently seattle has had problems with landfills and the old part of seattle has sunk--so the underground showed the first floors of many buildings and the old streets that used to be there- but now are underground- just a cool tour...after the tour- went to china town(nothing too interesting) and then headed back to downtown seattle- went shopping where i found my sisters pink purse- sooo random-basically saw it in fresno- was too expensive so my sis/i left it- she regretted not buying it- i went back to the fresno store- they sold out--so finding it in seattle- really random--and very exciting. went back to the waterfront and ate there--talked about life in general-friends, family, relationships for hours- was nice to talk to someone new and get new perspective on things that happened to me in the past--after talking- went to dahlia lounge for dessert where it was listed as seattle's best dessert- and it was very, VERY good- had my chocolate fudge cake and nan ordered the famous pie- always a good time. then we headed to the hostel and went to bed :)   wednesday, july 28th, 2004 seattle day 2  so today i headed to seattle center alone since nan had already been there the day before i got there--i got there early--9am--and was one of the first people up the needle- great views--the elevator was cool cause it has a glass case so you can see everything while you go up--something rare for elevators...anyways, after that- went to EMP- experience the music project--very cool building- made by frank gerry--famous architect- inside a lot of things to do- even though it was 20 bucks to get in- i knew it would be worth it and it was- seeing all the memorabilia from all these bands from seattle- and beyond- just was the coolest thing ever- a lot of costumes too- everyone from superman/robin/kiss/brittany spears/christina a/beyonce/jimi hendrix/nirvana/the list continues. what i was most star struck was by the costume of micheal jackson and the black sequins jacket WITH the WHITE sequined glove--wtf--i seriously had my mouth open and was just in heaven- i grew up with MJ- yes, he has problems- but i still love his old stuff :) anyways, after EMP-went to the science center- included in my pass- thought since i'm going to be a science teacher- good to see whats going on in science centers--so i went- all elementary school stuff- no high school stuff- but still interesting nonetheless--was fun putsing with the tide pools- different machines- even the butterfly exhibit where i got to see butterflies up close...neato. after that-got to see an IMAX movie(free) about volcanoes that live in the depths of the oceans- very neat movie but kids behind me were asking all the little kids questions and it was frustrating to pay attention to- all good... after the science theatre- i walked around a little more the seattle center than headed back on the 'monorail' that they had and toured the aquarium--i love aquarium, i do--but yea, now after living in sd for how many years and being at seaworld especially--no aquarium really can compare- they had seals, and sealions, and otters--so that was neato--but neat to see little kids enjoying themselves and screeming in glee. after that- went to pioneer square to get the pics that i missed from the day before and headed to the art museum where they had real Van Goughs-i've gone to the van gogh museum in amsterdam and this museum was very comprable--the cool thing about this museum was that they had the famous terrace one that he painted in paris- very, VERY neato--then i went back to the hostel- since it was a wednesday night- FREE dinner- pasta--which was decent--oh did i mention that they gave free breakfasts as well--and FREE internet--wtf--and the coolest gig--they started handing out FREEE beers--were we stoked??- yea!!--shitty beer- but beer nonetheless--for 15 bucks a night- um CAN'T COMPLAIN. i met nan at dinner and she wanted to go to cheesecake factory for dessert cause she always heard about it and i was like, sure- why not- even though not a big fan of the place since their food is always supersized. had another chocolate cake- brutal- and then we headed to the hostel to rest- much better rest--   thursday, july 29th, 2004 seattle day 3/tinu/sumner  today i decided to do something seattlin(according to frommers itenerary) and head to the burke-gilman trail- went to fremont- another area of seattle- very eclictic(sp?) and just one of those cities that is nice to visit- but wouldn't want to live there--i tried for a good hour trying to find a bike shop- lead to different locations- and then got the right directions finally to go to UW and get a bike from there- after an hour of walking in my FLIP FLOPS- my feet were done and i was ready to bike--i got my bike from recycled cycles and the guy that ended up helping me was from huntington beach and went to the same high school as my friend karin who i was visiting later- very random- i headed out on my bike ride--very FUN--very flat which was nice and a gorgeous view- i LOVED it--it was pretty empty since it was a thursday and the guy told me later on that i went a good 40 miles roundtrip- was i stoked--oh yes. after biking, toured a little of UW and hopped on a bus to capitol hill--i basically just walked the main street- broadway--reminded me of PB--so i was over it in a second and just headed down the hill to downtown where i went a little shopping. then i passed the manicure/pedicure place and i was like fuck it, i'm on vacation--so i got a manicure AND a pedicure(first one ever)--was very nice after my somewhat brutal bike ride--then i took a shower and my cousin, tinu, picked me up with his g/f, denise and we went to a trendy italian place near pike place, called the pink door--very good food and lasagna being one of my favorite foods- i was stuffed by the end. my cousin likes to eat in style- so yea- very filling with appetizers--plus, he's always trying to get me fat- haha. then we headed to his place- i love my cousin- i really do- bachelor boy- mr. doctor- lives in a kinda run-down place- has like 1000 dvds(i'm NOT exaggerating-claims he spends 20 bucks a week on them)--and has a futon mattress(no frame) as a bed--so go figure...slept on the futon bed and then was awakened by the loud train(he warned me- but yea, it was ridiculous)   friday, july 30th, 2004 Sumner/Yakima  Tinu dropped me off at the car rental place- got a pioneer escort--whoo hoo- drove to yakima(2 hours) and met my sister at her new apartment which was really nice. we immediatly went to the wineries near yakima and went to many places- Hyatt, wine glass(yes thats the name), silverlake, and others--i dont' remember at this time- we stocked up on a lot of wine since my parents need to stock their new bar and ended up getting 7 bottles- 6 in a box- one in my carryon(bitch to carry that on the plane-but i did it)--after that--she showed me around yakima and then we met her roomate at home and decided to go to dinner at a mexican restarant, tequillas- was fun sitting outside and her roomate, aimee- was a fun girl to hang out with too...after that- went to bed...   saturday, july 31st, 2004 Yakima/Roopam's birthday  today was roopam's birthday- we first started the day by going to the mall and getting my sister her manicure and pedicure(since i already got mine in seattle- was a waste for me to go again)...then we just hung out at her apartment and friends brought over mad alcohol and the keg of beer--we got dressed and then waited for all of my sis's friends--i wore my sexy red dress that i never get to wear and my sister looked hot in her dress too. her friends were really fun-all news people--but fun to meet and a big mix of people--from policemen and firemen--hehe...party got somewhat broken up by the cops because of the beer pong but then the party moved to another apartment of roopam's friend that happened to live in the same complex- so the party lasted till ohhh SIX am--so tons of fun--and a very happy bday for roopam...   sunday, august 1st, 2004 yakima continued  today roopam and i slept in and didn't really do much except hang out in the apartment and watch tv- we were tired from the night before and we went to a bbq at night for one of her friends that was leaving--good times to see the friends from the night before and hound a fireman about what he's seen/done in fires--or calls--did you know they have to respond to everything- even hangnails--never knew that--911 is called not in emergencies only i guess.   monday, august 2nd, 2004 yakima/seattle/snoaqualmie falls/back to sd  today, i woke up early and headed out to seattle so that i could take my tour- the van picked me up at a local hotel and i headed out to the wineries- chateau st. michelle and another one- i have to look it up(yes, mel i'll get that to you)...drank up some wine- got a tour of the bottling process--and ate lunch at a brewery--then the bus lead our group to the snoaqualmie falls- very cool falls- has a great lookout- were only there for 20 minutes- but we got our view in and it was great sight. then we headed to the chocolate factory where i got a tour of the chocolate making process and got to taste some licorice--i ended up buying chocolate covered licorice--then the bus dropped me off at the airport and then joe/jess picked me up and we went to the living room in OB--i burned my tongue on the hot chocolate- but good times with good people...   tuesday, august 3rd, 2004 sd/huntington beach  today, after realizing that my date with jess and coffee was not necessary- i headed to steph's dads house in bonsal- reminded me of the time where a LOT of us went to jason's parents house and were like, where are we--steph's dad's place was gorgeous though--gorgeous view- nice pool--just a really homely home--stephs dad cooked us pancakes and we ate it with his homemade jam- yummy--after me/steph hung out for an hour--i was off to karin's house in huntington--karin and i decided to go to the mall(i never realized how much shopping i was doing until now)--and then we went to fred's for happy hour(taco tuesdays)--ate up and then watched her favorite show- summerland- interesting show- but yea- not one i would get addicted to...   wednesday, august 4th, 2004 huntington beach continued  today was my mom's bday--so i called her and sent her some flowers like a good daughter that i am--karin and i decided to go kayaking once again--we went during memorial day weekend and decided to do it again- for 8 bucks for 3 hours- can't complain- we were more leisurly than last time cause i think we were both out of shape and just wanted to enjoy ourselves vs. getting a workout..after kayaking- we headed out to downtown disney to meet my friend lisa, and her new fiance, tom. it was SOOO nice to see her since i hadn't seen her since my europe trip and get to meet her fiance before the wedding--after dinner at the espn zone--we shopped around and ended up at sephora--where lisa got some makeup for her wedding and karin/i had a BLAST of life with jessica simpson's new line--DESSERT--omg- if you haven't tried it- its awesome- i was SOO skeptical seeing it on tv--but yea- totally fun to try on- and it REALLY does taste good--just really sexy and i actually contemplated buying it cause it was that much fun. after disney, i dropped karin off at her place and headed to ucla to my brothers place--got to hang out with him/rupy- meet his new roomate- and then i was exhuasted...the next morning- i went home to fresno--whoo hoo  if you're still reading this- i commend you--i just wanted to journal my trip and this was the best way to go--hope you enjoyed :)
