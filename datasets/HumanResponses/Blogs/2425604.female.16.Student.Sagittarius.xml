      Just because you said what you wanted doesn't make it right. Just because the moment was heated doesn't mean that I wanted to fight, and even though I saw your anger, even though I saw your face, the words that you cited were chosen, not thinked, not spoken in haste. All on you and me. All on you and me.  Just for the moment, just one more time, just one more second and we'll be just fine, this could be just, be just in case it's the last time. Just for the moment, Just one more time, Just one more second and we'll be just fine, This could be the last time...  Just until sundown, just one more day I could hold you, that I could hold you, Just until sundown, just one more day I could hold you, without you, pushing me away. All on you, And me.     how i feel rite now :-(

      holla... yea... i feel like so dumb compared to everyone else right now ... like when i get excited about something so small and it makes me happy they are like thats dumb michelle shut the F up ... it makes me sad... i like appreciating the little things and no one understands that beacsue its good but it could be better... and they have to rub it in my face that they have everything better than i do why maybe its more pms... o well its sad... and no one reads my thing anymore o well no one cares...   I think it's time to move.  The winters so cold,  the summers over to soon.  So lets pack our bags  and settle down where palm trees grow.   i hate winter... if we dont have school im gonna cry .. i really rather have school because im so sick of sitting home alone with the boy playing sims in my pjs... i wanna go out places and see things... some ppl just think everything is awesome because they have privaleges that i dont ... teh ... ill deal... i can walk places... it doesnt bother me ... but if you could drive michelle that would be cool... yea it would be cool considering that fact that if i had gotten my permit by now I STILL WOULDNT BE DRIVING because im younger and all this bragging is pissing me the fuck off .. o yea i can drive here and go out to dinner here ... cuz I CAN DRIVE... well ass hole i cant so i dont care ... im done bye

      im kinda good kinda bad but more good than bad which is good... lol i think ... lol  its the calm before the storm... im gonna be hitting the dot soon HOORAY lol but then ill get over the pms and illjust be in pain for a few days and ill be fine ... anyways i have a good song to share with you ill highlight the good points:   Am I loud and clear, or am I breaking up. Am I still your charm, or am I just bad luck. Are we getting closer, or are we just getting more lost.  I'll show you mine  if you show me yours first. lets compare scars I'll tell you whose is worse lets unwrite these pages  and replace them with our own words  We live on front porces, and swing life away. We get by just fine here on minimum wage. If love is a labor, I'll slave till the end. I wont cross these streets untill you hold my hand.  Been here so long  I think it's time to move. The winters so cold, the summers over to soon. So lets pack our bags  and settle down where palm trees grow.  I've got some friends, some that I hardly know. We've had some times, I wouldnt trade for the world. We chase these days down, with talks of places that we will go.  We live on front porces, and swing life away. We get by just fine here on minimum wage. If love is a labor, I'll slave till the end. I wont cross these streets untill you hold my hand.  Swing life away      lol  i love this song and it says that money doesnt make everyone happy as long asyou got the ones around you that care then you will always be happy... unless your pmsing lol ok i must go my duties call... or not bye

      hey all umm everythingis good and stuff i wanna share something with you lol its a quote but id unno if you will understand but ive been thinking about this alot lately :   You laugh at every word, trying hard to be cute.  I almost feel sorry for what I'm gonna do.  And your hair smells of smoke.  Who will cast the first stone?  You can sin or spend the night all alone.  Brass buttons on your coat hold the cold in the shape of a heart that they cut out of stone. You're using all your looks that you've thrown from the start.  If you let me have my way, I swear I'll tear you apart.  Cause it's all you can be.  You're a drunk and you're scared.  It's ladies night.  All the girls drink for free.    like i no alot of whoever read this might not no what night im talking about but its something that happened a year ago this february vaca im not gonna post it on the blog becasue its kind of private but maybe you might understand by this hint o well umm i had a good day so far its fn cold out like -4 with a windchill of -25 what the f is that about im asking you lol i hate this cold weather :   The time has come for colds and overcoats.  We're quiet on the ride,  we're all just waiting to get home.  Another week away, my greatest fear.

      HELLO CHILDREN umm i have to share this with you and this is kinda how i feel i wish that you would read it if you want to anyways here it is:   spent too many hours, holding up walls standing in corners and clenching my jaw. Watching you watching the ones that I wanted to be. Blaming this all on a moment, blaming this all on my views, blaming the mood of the music, blaming it all on you. All on you and me. All on you and me.  Just because you said what you wanted doesn't make it right.  Just because the moment was heated doesn't mean that I wanted to fight, and even though I saw your anger, even though I saw your face, the words that you cited were chosen, not thinked, not spoken in haste. All on you and me. All on you and me.   Just for the moment, just one more time, just one more second and we'll be just fine, this could be just, be just in case it's the last time. Just for the moment, Just one more time, Just one more second and we'll be just fine, This could be the last time...  Just until sundown, just one more day I could hold you, that I could hold you, Just until sundown, just one more day I could hold you, without you, pushing me away. All on you, And me.  yea i have highlgighted the points to show you what is the direct point of that quote like itd would cool if you read the whole thing but im not gonna push you into it ... and sorry if you all take it the wrong way but thats how i feel damnit and if you dont like it than shove it up your butt ok mi out then bye

      Keep the noise low, She doesn’t want to blow it. Shaking head to toe while your left hand does "the show me around" Quickens your heartbeat, It beats me straight into the ground You don’t recover from a night like this. A victim, still lying in bed - completely motionless. A hand moves in the dark to a zipper. Hear a boy bracing tightagainst sheets barely whisper, "This is so messed up." Upon arrival the guests had all stared, Dripping wet and clearly depressed, he'd headed straight for the stairs. No longer cool, but a boy in a stitch. Unprepared for a life full of lies and failing relationships. (Up the stairs, the station where the act becomes the art of growing up.) He keeps his hands low, He doesn't wanna blow it. He's wet from head to toe, and his eyes give her the up and the down. His stomach turns, and he thinks of throwing up But the body on the bed beckons forward,  and he starts growing up.  The fever, the focus, The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell. The tickle, the taste of... It used to be the reason I breathe,  but now it's choking me up. Die young and save yourself.  She hits the lights, This doesn't seem quite fair. Despite everything he learned from his friends, he doesn't feel so prepared. She's breathing quiet and smooth, He is gasping for air. "This is the first and last time", he says She fakes a smile, and presses her hips into his. He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides. He's holding back from telling her exactly what it really feels like. He is the lamb, she is the slaughter. She's moving way too fast, and all he wanted was to hold her. Nothing that he tells her is really having an effect. He whispers that he loves her, but she's probably only looking for... (Up the stairs, the station where the act becomes the art of growing old.) So much more than he could ever give, A life full of lies and meaningful relationships. He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides, He waits for it to end and for the aching in his gut to subside.  The fever, the focus, The reason that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell. Die young and save yourself. The tickle, the taste of It used to be the reason that I breathed,  but now it's choking me up. Die young and save yourself.  Up the stairs, the station where the act becomes, the art of growing old.  The fever, the focus, The reason that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell. Die young and save yourself. The tickle, the taste of It used to be the reason that I breathed,  but now it's choking me up. Die young and save yourself.   sorry i jsut wanted to share that with you its a good song and it reminds me of stuff but its a good song anyways umm i dunno shits been alright like christmas was good new years was alright and the rest of my vaca has totally been boring ... i dunno me and adam .. are doin good ... i guess ... im not too worried about it tho im eating cold pizza last night i was up till 3 in the morning   my sleeping is getting fucked up again which means when school starts ill be sleeping through all of my class my mom made this pizza its pretty good ... i got american wedding its pretty good ... i liked it its better than the other ones ... i feel so empty lol ... lol its so random but its true ... i no no one is reading this anymore cuz i dont go online alot but ... i really feel empty and its sad ... i dunno o well ... i wish i could be in a good mood ... when ever that is like ... lol probably tomorro lol o well im gonna go try and play some video gameage yea ... so  i guess ill ttyl bye

Laetitia, you got my hand shaking,  I'm begging you oh baby please stop breaking my heart  because I got the feeling  that you and I will never really get it on.   So I'll leave my door open all night  in case you decide you want to stop on by. Because you got to know.. who's been singing that song on the radio.  The one that goes...   Girl, come to me... The only broken-hearted loser you'll ever need,  or I'll be left alone forever with my magazines.    lol im for ever left with my magazines lol im so funnie

      look wat one of my "good" friends wrote about me:   I feel as though some of my friends are using me for my moms house and like... thats the only reason im there... Cuz i piss them off all the time and all they do is ask,, "when we goin to ur moms?". They want me to help them which this book... i duno if i want to... cuz then im gonna feel as though im sex crazed... which im not... because i dont even have sex... well i guess thats a crime nowadays...   I've come to the conclusion that i never have anything to say. Maybe ill just stop talking to people that judge you on what you say... that's why I like my guy friends... they never do that... and Im not saying that ALL my gurlies do.. but ya know how the female species is... I can actually have a good conversation with my guy friends that never ends with somone saying "yeah i fucked my boyfriend last night" or something related to their sex-life.   Oh yeah I got silver in VICA... Maybe it's time i go on co-op to be free from the people that make me feel like shizzle...  -Heather-Heather-   welll fuck head if we make you feel like shit so much why did you keep talking to us ... why do you always fucking never tell us shit that makes you feel like shit... how are we supposed to be good friends if you wont let us no what the hell is bugging you and then fucking write it in your journal and brag about how awesome your bfs friends are because tahts all you are gonna have left ... thats all i have to say good day

      i can think of the somwat good times ... and it makes me happy    Kiss your hand with permission To show that you are royalty tonight The radio is playing the song That got us up to dance around The record is spinning around and around To the sounds of change  And we can stop to see you smile Out of the blue, to colored sky While the fireworks are lighting up your eyes And everything is sitting still Paints a picture such of you It is you, honey, it's you  Every night at this time We start to whisper The future's hopes will keep the stars away The radio is playing the song That got us up to dance around The record is spinning around and around To the sounds of change  And I'm turning the dial Spinning for reception  I'm not restless You're the view The radio is playing our song Breathless, with not much to say  You sent me to the top of the world

       Throw away the radio suitcase That keeps you awake Hide the telephone, the telephone, telephone in case You realize that sometimes you're just not okay You level off, you level off, you level off But it's not alright now You need to understand There's nothing strange about this You need to know your friends You need to know that  I'll be waving my hand Watching you drown watching you scream Quiet or loud  And maybe you should sleep And maybe you just need A friend as clumsy as you've been There's no one laughing You will be safe in here  You will be safe in here   Throw away this very old shoelace, That tripped you again Try and shrug it off, shrug it off, shrug it off It's only skin now You need to understand There's nothing fake about this You need to let me in I'm watching you and...  I'll be waving my hand Watching you drown Watching you scream No one's around  And maybe you should sleep And maybe you just need A friend as clumsy as you've been There's no one laughing You will be safe in here  You will be safe in...Oooo  I'll be waving my hand Watching you drown Watching you scream Quiet or loud  And maybe you should sleep And maybe you just need A friend as clumsy as you've been There's no one laughing You will be safe in here You will be safe in here You will be safe in here In here    that song reminds me of last feb vaca and it reminds me of mike i miss him not as much as heather but i did have a super duper kick ass time last year lol good and bad times and i will never for get them ok ill ttyl

      this is wat some ass hat said about gay marriages   "oh god i mean i think people really don't get this and the only porblem is that it could open up possibilities for other things to be passes such as under age sex with out the consolant of a gardian and also marrige to animals also it could open up bother and sister marrige which would be completely wrong and it would have to be suppported because of the passage of gay marrige think of the consiquinces from it it would eliminate pedifials and molesters which means you couldn't leave your house or do an thing because of it ~thought on gay marrige. just think about it before responding"   what an immature niave and ignorant thing to say for all those who agree say I

       It's just like you to contest Wearing like a label on your breast Don't you see what this takes of me? A certain callousness complies with your charm & in your pride A hopeful look draped in despise.  I want to give you whatever you need. What is it you need? Is it what I need? I want to give you whatever you need. What is it you need? Is it within me?  It's hard to explain how I am getting by on so little from you. It's hard to believe that I would let myself get so wrapped into you. There's got to be something that would be worthwhile for me to give to you. We need a connection but you seem to push me far away from you. From you, from you.  The harder I push the further I fall. Well you don't mind me being headstrong. But you don't want to sing along. Maybe it's trite but I can always, always, always be wrong  Trying not to be . . . Trying not to be wrong     listening to old music... reminds me of all the good and bad tiems and i really wish i had the good times bnack where there wasnt so much fighting between everyone and like everyone was happy but me of course because ... i left the situation i was in and in return for a situation i liked better and now i dunno im kinda happy but eveyrone else isnt so now its making me sad... ooo thinking of the good times

      why are we so busy that we cant stop for a second and play a game with our family ... is it that tiring after a hard work week to play a game of monopoly... i mean .. we bitch how we dont get along then we cant even play a simple game together because we are sooo tired... i dont understand ... i mean playing games is supposed to be fun .. but i guess its just too difficult for ppl to handle... our generation of familys are too busy to take time and listen to eachother or even play a nice game of monopoly and we wonder why we have so much stress. because we never have time to relax and have fun with the ppl we "love"... if we love them then why cant we just spend time with them ... love you bye

       Early in the morning wake up to a bright blue sky. Lightening comes at any time To break it down and make it ugly. I know that it's just for me,  Cause no one else can feel or understand. That's alright because, I can handle all that you throw down.   And I hope you find a perfect place where skies are beautiful all of the time. That's all that matters pretty pretty. And I know that's all that you could care about. There's no reason why you can't.  It's all about the icing Nobody cares about what's inside. You could see the outiside face. It looks good it must be great. And I know that is all you see. What would it matter anyway, Cause I could see right through, Your pretty pretty skin, today.  And I hope you find a perfect place where skies are beautiful all of the time. That's all that matters pretty pretty. And I know that's all that you could care about. There's no reason why you can't.  No reason why I should try to go on anymore My reasons all gone. No reason why you should,  Try to make excuses to make me feel alright. Excuses call for stupid reasons. And I know that it's not much that I can offer right now. Just give me one little second And I will try my hardest  To make you feel like I'm someone else.   im doing a facial thing... im gonna get my hair cut... im kinda sad right now i just like cried so i got my mask wet .. damn it all and im watching my new dvd its so good ... all of the uncut out takes are so funnie lol ... ill just have to sit and watch them alone ... not like anyone would wanna anyways ... o well im sure im gonna find something to do today ... o well ok im gonna go now ttyl

        I believe you belong in Pride and Prejudice; a world of satire and true love. A world where everything is crystal clear to the reader, and yet where new things seem to be happening all the time. You belong in a world where your free-thought puts you above the silly masses, and where bright eyes and intelligence are enough to attract the arrogant millionaire/prejudiced young woman of your choice.    urlLink   Which Classic Novel do You Belong In?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     ive actually never read this book and i didnt even care about what quiz it is ... it just fed my feining for random quizes i find on the net... i think i may need help lol

Just bend the pieces ‘till they fit  Like they were made for it  But, they weren’t meant for this  No, they weren’t meant for this     i no i write in this so much but its good cuz this way i dont bitch too much ... well if you dont like my bitching then fuck you ... i mean i didnt mean that ... o well who cares its my damn journal i can bitch as much as i want .. i mean you dnt have to read this ... i may tell you to but you can be like no you bitch too much in it and id be like .. but bitching is my life and youd be lik teh shut up bitch and smack me with your words  urlLink     damn memories ... they are so dumb

        Sagittarius November 22-December 21 This Week: 03/15/2004 - 03/21/2004           Weekly Overview   You'll be unusually focused on money and possessions Monday and Tuesday; go with the feeling and see if you can make bold changes to your spending or earning habits. Midweek you'll be back to your old self and maybe a little more socially oriented. Try to reach out to someone you don't know well but would like to learn more about -- people will be more receptive to your charm. The weekend will be slow-going for you, but not frustrating. You'll feel lazy and the pace should suit you fine. Energy picks up Sunday, and might take you by surprise if you don't have activities planned.     my weekly horoscope ... interesting ... you should of read my like romantic one ... most depressing ... it was like youll start trying to find a new love ... i dont think im ready for that ... lol im just so dumb ... im totally dwelling over some dumb shit lately ...

       I'm missing your bed I never sleep Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak, And this bottle of beast Is taking me home  I'm cuddling close To blankets and sheets But you're not alone, and you're not discreet Make sure I know who's taking you home.  I'm reading your note over again And there's not a word that I comprehend, Except when you signed it I will love you always and forever  Well as for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs And sit alone and wonder How you're making out But as for me, I wish that I was anywhere, with anyone Making out.  I'm missing your laugh How did it break? And when did your eyes begin to look fake? I hope you're as happy as you 're pretending.  I'm cuddling close To blankets and sheets and I am alone In my defeat I wish I knew you were safely at home  I'm missing your bed I never sleep Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak, And this bottle of beast is taking me home.  Well as for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs And sit alone and wonder How you're making out but as for me, I wish that I was anywhere, with anyone Making out.  Your hair, it's everywhere. Screaming infidelities And taking its wear.    : ( missing adam ... what else is new... i have to call dean lol i want mrs lew to leave so i can and she keeps yelling at me to be quiet teh... ill GIVE HER QUIET TEH OK I GOTTA GO ...

      Take the picture from the wall cause you think that nothing matters.  Take a picture from the plane and it's a long way to the floor.  Cut your finger on the edge cause it's sharper than they told you.  Take a leap from out the window cause it's way too far to go through the door.  And we learn as we age.  We've learned nothing and my body still aches.  And you take cause they give.  Though I love you and my body it leaks like a sieve.   I Dunno whats up with me and lyrics today sorry um like 2 blogs before was actually talking if you do read this and you havent seen it all day lol   love   chell

      We sent out the SOS call It was a quater past four  In the morning When the storm broke our second anchor line. Four months at sea. Four months of calm seas Only to be pounded in the shallows Off of the tip of Montauk Point.  They call them rogues. They travel fast and alone, One hundred foot faces Of God's good ocean gone wrong What they call love is a risk, Cause you will always get hit Out of nowhere  By some wave and end up on your own.  The hole in the hull defied the crews attempts  To bail us out. And flooded the engines and radio And half buried bow.  Your tongue is a rudder. It steers the whole ship. Sends your words past your lips Or keeps them safe behind your teeth. But the wrong words will strand you. Come off course while you sleep. Sweep your boat out to sea Or dashed it to bits on the reef.  The vessel groans The ocean pressures its frame. Off the port I see the lighthouse Through the sleet and the rain. And I wish for one more day  To give my love and repay debts. But the morning finds our bodies Washed up thirty miles west.  They say that the captain  Stays fast with the ship  Through still and storm. But this ain't the Dakota. And the water is cold. We won't have to fight for long.  This is the end. This story's old But it goes on and on  Until we disappear. Calm me and let me taste The salt that you breathed While you were underneath. I am the one who haunts your dreams Of mountains sunk below the sea. I spoke the words but never Gave a thought to what they all could mean. I know that this is what you want. A funeral keeps both of us apart. You know that you are not alone. Need you like water in my lungs. This is the end.  This is the end. This story's old But it goes on and on  Until we disappear. Calm me and let me taste The salt that you breathed While you were underneath. I am the one who haunts your dreams Of mountains sunk below the sea. I spoke the words but never Gave a thought to what they all could mean. I know that this is what you want. A funeral keeps both of us apart. You know that you are not alone. Need you like water in my lungs. This is the end.     it sounds so sad... i like it ... aww joe is like passed out on the desk... still thinking about adam... lol its not like he can read this anyways lol o well   lots of love  ~chell~

        You're Element is Light. You are friendly, happy, social, bubbly, and can brighten up any one's day. You are very kind and a real people person because you have several friends (or atleast should). You're cheery nature makes you lovable and your stunning looks are sweet and stand out.     urlLink   What's Your Element(girls)? (PICTURES)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla        To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world...................................................you love-sick puppy! you're so in love that it's written all over your face. your friends know it, you family knows it, and you probably told that person you love them. smart move. maybe they'll love you back!     urlLink What quote should I give you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla        You're a mermaid. The stereotypical mermaid had a long, fish-like tail that blended with the human torso at the hips and almost white skin with red hair or some off color like green or blue. They were the most fantastic singers and the siren type of mermaids would lure sailors with their lovely lullaby into dangerous rocks. They were mostly harmless and peacefull and they were content to simply sit on the beach combing their hair or in the water playing with friends. They never wore clothes and were always women. They were sweet and a little deciteful at times. (please rate)    urlLink   What Mystical Creature Are You? (Pictures)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      People are often unreasonable, illogical, and self-centered; Forgive them anyway. If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives; Be kind anyway. If you are successful you will win some false friends and true enemies; Succeed anyway. If you are honest and frank, people may cheat you; Be honest and frank anyway. What you spend years building, someone could destroy overnight; Build anyway. If you find serenity and happiness, they may be jealous; Be happy anyway. The good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow; Do good anyway. Give the world the best you have, and it may never be enough; Give the world the best you've got anyway You see, in the final analysis, it is between you and God; It was never between you and them anyway. --Mother Teresa   lol i found it in somones profile lol im such a stealer what an ass i am ...

There's just something about his smile. He looks so nice,  I wish I had friends like that  They'd always be there for me, I wouldn't look bad  Yeah, they wouldn't talk behind my back.      too bad for me : (

      Your eyes, followed me here.  Your eyes, seamless and sure.  They leave me broken and, in need of a cure.   Your eyes, followed me here.  Your eyes, sifting my soul.  They leave me broken hands, those diamonds from the coal.   They lace me along,  Giving synapse of white lines.  Then chasing the dawn,  Story book syntax.   Your eyes slit the throat, of all I know.  About myself and this life.  Silhouette lies.   And your eyes, speaking in tongues.  Vigilant still, filling my lungs.  Testing my will.  They leave me broken and, bruised and bleeding.   Your eyes, resting in flame,  Leaven me breathless again.  Like hydrogen spread on fault lines.  Or dead, kissing me with exposure to radon.   Your eyes slit the throat, of all I know.  About myself and this life.  Silhouette lies.   Your eyes, Your eyes.  Speaking in tongues.  Vigilant still, lead our way.  Filling my lungs.  Testing my will.   You slit the throat, of I know.  About myself and this life.  Silhouette Lies.   You slit my throat.  Because I know,  That this life, is a lie.  So slit my throat.

Dann ging ich online, als ich Haupt erhielt und ich herausfand, da Ryan's Geburtstag die Sekunde von kann  ist. Ich fand Ryan heraus und Kristyn's Kompatibilitt on-line-throught ihre Tierkreiszeichen und -ich ging zu ihrem Haus und hing heraus . Dann half ich kristyn, ihre parascope Sache zu tun, aber meine Mamma rief an und hatte mich Haus fr Abendessen, das es gutes und jetzt i'm khles Materialon-line-Recht war?   lol idont actually no how much of that makes sense in german but o well lol i dunno .. im sad i feel bad for alex lol really tho ick i feel like and ass but i just dont like him i still totally have feelings for adam and its killing me damnit why cant i jsut get over him   love ya bye

      me and angie are gonna right a book about high school if you wanna read more about this fucked up idea that we thought of ... visit her site its on the right side of my blog under the linkage ... heres a song that goes along the same lines its by relient k its called hoopes i did it again  what's up dude? I'm getting kind of bored let's get some food and then hit movies 4 what's going on?whats up with all our friends? let's start a rumor just to find out where it ends  cause a small town is like a small stage for teenagers and their drama  instead of playing shows, we'll be showing plays like 90210 without the beverly hills  well, don't you think it's high time what we never settle down well, don't you think it's high time that we get out of this town cause if we leave then we just might be okay  hoopes i did it again i messed everything up, and i think i hurt my friends hoopes i did it again relationships that work are things that i can't comprehend  ohio has the flavor of a water chestnut it's not too crazy and it's not the best but we're not setting forest fires just out of boredom i'd rather see a movie if in fact i can afford one  well, don't you think it's high time that we never settle down well don't you think it's high time  that we get out of this town cause if we leave then we just might make a difference and if we leave then we just might be okay and i don't think it would hurt to get away  dan bakitus said i'm shallow he said i've got no integrity but, i don't know dan bakitus and dan bakitus, he don't know me  cause we always sayin canton you can't enoy(canton joy) yourself well, there's thruth to that but may i add it's not half bad and never less than that.

      Daily Horoscope   Weekend Update: Friday is busy and may feel kind of thrown together, no matter how organized you try to be. Don’t expect things to neatly fall into place – and forget about sticking to a sensible schedule or routine. Last minute changes, including cancellations, may occur. Just brace yourself and remain philosophical. Keep in mind that any upcoming change is probably a good thing. Saturday begins with a set of expectations that may be tough to live up to. Don’t box yourself or others into an impossible corner. If you’re counting on others to behave a certain way or do a certain thing, you may be disappointed. It’s best to just clear your mind and let things happen as they will. Give up pointless control fantasies and try to live in harmony with your surroundings. Minimize stress and noise every chance you get because your nerves are already pretty raw. Saturday night is your reward – pleasing and very enjoyable. Sunday has even more to offer, especially if you’re creative. Inspired and imaginative, you rediscover your muse and move forward with an important project.    yea i no lol its fuckin gay i hope tomorro is good... well i was looking up compatiblity on line between signs and it says that i would get bored witha scorpio and his hermit life style but i would be transfixed with him for ever ... and im compatible with an aquarius ... so if you are an aquarius fuckin ... call me lol yea ok bye

      hey i no my last post was long so dont worry i just rote it so that way i can look back at it ... so umm this is a thing ive seen before but i just seen it again and i wanted to show it to you    All I really need to know I learned in kindergarten.   ALL I REALLY NEED TO KNOW about how to live and what to do  and how to be I learned in kindergarten. Wisdom was not  at the top of the graduate-school mountain, but there in the  sandpile at Sunday School. These are the things I learned:  Share everything.  Play fair.  Don't hit people.  Put things back where you found them.  Clean up your own mess.  Don't take things that aren't yours.  Say you're sorry when you hurt somebody.  Wash your hands before you eat.  Flush.  Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you.  Live a balanced life - learn some and think some  and draw and paint and sing and dance and play  and work every day some.  Take a nap every afternoon.  When you go out into the world, watch out for traffic,  hold hands, and stick together.  Be aware of wonder.  Remember the little seed in the styrofoam cup:  The roots go down and the plant goes up and nobody  really knows how or why, but we are all like that.  Goldfish and hamsters and white mice and even  the little seed in the Styrofoam cup - they all die.  So do we.  And then remember the Dick-and-Jane books  and the first word you learned - the biggest  word of all - LOOK.  Everything you need to know is in there somewhere.  The Golden Rule and love and basic sanitation.  Ecology and politics and equality and sane living.  Take any of those items and extrapolate it into  sophisticated adult terms and apply it to your  family life or your work or your government or  your world and it holds true and clear and firm.  Think what a better world it would be if  all - the whole world - had cookies and milk about  three o'clock every afternoon and then lay down with  our blankies for a nap. Or if all governments  had a basic policy to always put things back where  they found them and to clean up their own mess.  And it is still true, no matter how old you  are - when you go out into the world, it is best  to hold hands and stick together.    -Robert Fulghum

I saw the hospital.  Nurse the shoreline like a wound.  We paint a lover's tryst.  We're neither clear nor descript.  We kept it safe and slow.  The quiet things that no one ever knows.  Keep the blood in your head and keep your feet on the ground.  Today's the day it gets tired.  Today's the day we drop down.  Give up my body in bed.  All for an empty hotel.  Wasting words on lowercases and capitals.  I contemplate the day we wed.  Your friends are boring me to death.  Your veil is ruined in the rain.  By then you like to do without.  There's nothing new to talk about.  And though our kids are blessed,  the parents let them shoulder all the blame.  Keep the blood in your head and  keep your feet on the ground.  Today's the day it gets tired.  Today's the day we drop down.  Give up my body in bed.  All for an empty hotel.  Wasting words on lowercases and capitals.  I lie for only you. And I lie well. Halleluh.  Keep the blood in your head and keep your feet on the ground.  Today's the day it gets tired. Today's  the day we drop down.  Give up my body in bed.  All for an empty hotel.  Wasting words on lowercases and capitals"  love ya    chell

Well I don’t need to ask my friends Because I know mine was bustin’ up my jaw bone Thanks to all those nights and weekends  Cuz theme parks are so much more fun when the sun’s outside And I lost my phone to the lake beneath the Batman Ride  The start of something, I don’t wanna begin it They’re looking for trouble, but with me, it won’t be found And I regret that I’m completely out of daytime minutes So I guess I’ll have to wait a lot till 8 o’clock comes around  When it comes to relationships (I’m the dumbest one) And I don’t mean just with girls (I mean with everyone) Your illustrations always point out just what's wrong with me It’s chapstick, and chapped lips, and things like chemistry  It’s chapstick, and chapped lips, and things like... It’s chapstick, and chapped lips, and things like... It’s chapstick, and chapped lips, and things like chemistry  Can I relate to you the way you relate to me?  Can you help me out with my chemistry?

      holy muffins check this shit out   todays horoscope  Before you make any rash decisions regarding a current relationship, think about it. You, above all signs, require a thousand percent of someone's devotion. If they're not quite ready to offer it, keep quiet for just a bit longer.   lol wierd right  and now look at tomorros  Whoever it is who's been stalling all your best-laid plans should definitely not be allowed to continue doing that any longer. Go right ahead and insist on a decision.  lol i no its weeeiiirrd ok bye

      It's a faster growing green That flows through these leaves I have, I try I guess we'll be alright  Way to try I got a line for you from me, better nice A beautiful baby blue sky that's looking up at you Now watch it fade away  But it's okay to come around When nights like this are never ending I tried so hard to make this perfect You and I somehow We can't see eye to eye together We always knew that you worked better  I know you want it all and you got me Sorry I never was everything you ever dreamed But kept at bay for just in case that day  But it's okay to come around When nights like this are never ending I tried so hard to make this perfect You and I somehow We can't see eye to eye together We always knew that you worked better  I don't want you to love me anymore  With my bags packed and ready to go Nothing's ever hurt so much for me than to let you go With my bags packed and ready to go Nothing's ever hurt so much for me than to let you go   lyrics to new bacground song  fyi for those who dont no    its baby blue by the early november

      Since day one you've been away And since then you've, you've made me stay Alone in a world where I'd like to hear  The words of approval ringing in my ear  Cuz I don't ask for much  Yet I want it all. I've gained nothing from this You want to see me fall  But, we'll stick to our passions We'll keep playing far and away Alone in a world where I'd like to see The smile on your face which means security  Cuz I don't ask for much Yet I want it all. I've gained nothing from this you want to see me fall  Don't live life by the norm in society Do what you have to do to keep you happy And  what if it doesn't add up to them at all? It makes sense to you, keep on, don't stall  Don't live life by the norm in society Do what you have to do to keep you happy And  what if it doesn't add up to them at all? It makes sense to you, keep on, don't stall  Cuz I don't ask for much Yet I want it all. I've gained nothing from this you want to see me fall  glasseater -- alone in the world

      ok well kristyn came over or watever i dunno ... umm and i watched her spanish deal it was funnie and stuff ... lol yea but yea ryan just called so yea im gonna ... go yea umm this is how i feel    Don't mean to scare you but I ,i've not been sleeping lately and phone calls aren't doing much to help. So if it's all the same i'd just as soon never have to offer explanation or excuse again.We make believe everyday we make our lives seem like there still worth living we find out in the end it's only us that we've been kidding. So find the darkest place and search under blankets for me.Smothering myself in this darkness.I'm lying down tonight and you're not lying with me.Honesty doesn't sit so well on you some thing you just can't fake.It's just another stupid drama that no one notices but you and you only take an interest when theres nothing else to do.But you won't mind Wait for all of it I just can't wait for all of this

      holy crap ... after walking home and thinking about what the hell happened to me and why i have become such a fuck up i get this from will in the mail:   A Battle Of Will.     They way I see it i'm nuts…. You might ask me, “why is that will?” well, the definition for crazy would be that you point of views, and your way of thinking, would be completely outlandish to the thinking of you peers. If everyone in the would thinks the sky is purple, and you still think its blue. Guess what, there is no way to prove, no matter how clear you see it, that the damn sky is blue. So why so I, everyday, want to run out into the streets screaming it? It’s a very twisted world. I think people like me exist almost to be like a ying yang effect. There is so much evil in this country, hell there’s more evil in this town then I can comprehend. So people like me are born, to keep the balance. My job in life is to help people be not exactly, but alitle more like me, “good”. Help them make “good” decisions. The problem is I suck at it. Besides what give me the right to tell people what to do. I see it as the best thing for them, but what if im wrong, or crazy. Maybe i’m just the exception to the rule, maybe all other people on this god forsaken earth need to be stupid asshole teens, and need to fuck there themselves up. Maybe its all dedicated to them learning a lesson. A lesson that is needed to become the adult the need to be, or kill them… A lesson I learned in rehab meeting with my mother, at 6. My family has told me that I grew up at 9, I was 9 going on 25. I never felt the effect of puberty. I never was incomprehensible, I ALWAYS and I mean always had the ability for abstract thought. I had my head on my shoulders for as long as I can remember. Why can I just make one person see the lesson that I learned o so long ago. Why am I cursed to watch ever person I fall in love with crash, and burn. I had a friend who freshmen year was studying for the sat’s, she had sex once, and regretted it. She was pretty, talented, and smart as a whip. She doesn’t know it but back then she could argue anything with me. Now she’s become close minded, she cant even argue her own points, she drinks, smokes, and god only knows what else. She’s failing (so much for the sat’s) she has unprotected sex on a regular basis, knowing “she can always just murder her child in an abortion clinic”, lol that not a real quote.. but its close enough. I mean who y cant people do the right thing, because it’s the right thing to do. Why do we need a reason to be good. Are people as a whole, that far gone? Are we that misguided. How are we going to protect ourselves, and run this country. If all we do is fuck off. I find it hard to believe that this is nesisary to making a good person in the long run. Well maybe i’m not crazy, maybe i’m just the last of a dieing breed. Unfortunately for me, unless I can figure out how to help the world, that how ill die, alone. And the last of my kind. Everyday is a fight, one that I will take to my grave. A fight that drives me insane with rage and despair. But now at least I have been shown finally, by the people I have given the lable of my friends that it is.. a hopeless fight. I am not going to help the ones I love, simply drive them away. So I need to take it down a notch and let them make the mistakes, untile I learn how to teach them. Who knows maybe i’m not here to change the world, maybe this is punishment for something i've done before. lol what a great irony if that’s true. Punish the evil, by giving him a hyper conchens. God I hate this place.     “A tiger sensing his death will never go quietly into the night, knowing his own demise lies ahead. He takes his last breath and goes down fighting.”     “ If I can draw but one drop of blood before I fall, then I will die a happy man.”   im fucking crying my eyes out .. i duno why ... i duno if like its ... i just duno im so fucking confused right now i wanna like seriously just get shot ... everytime somone like will tries to help mei do push them away ... and i dont listen .. why i duno ... but i try to help aija soo much and she does it to me ... wtf ... sigh .. i hate fucking being a teenager so much for the best years of my life ... yea best years of my life doing drugs and partying getting hurt and trampled on ... no one cares in high school and why should they ... it doesnt matter how you feel ... im not even making sense

      now that i look back at all the shit i have done ... why do i do it ... is it bragging rights or am i just an idiot or is it because its just like some sort of weird phase that we all go through at some point .. but if its a phase then why dont all people do like all this bad stuff ... i dont understand maybe some people are jsut smarter and some people might not be able to live life to the fullest for fears of their own self ... scared of what the out come may be later on ... they may think that they will turn out terrible ... but it doesnt happen all the time ... but they just cant trust themselves i suppose ... but as for my self im starting to believe i cant trust myself ... because if i was smart i would have not done all the shit i did on saturday but i did it ... and that makes me believe that if i cant stop my self now wat would stop me in the future ??? i no my friends wouldnt and that makes me question my friends ... should my friends had stoped me and my poor judgement ... but why didnt i stop them it was jsut as much my fault as theirs what we did but i dont think aija regrets it one bit ... why do i do it when i no ill regret it ... now that i only do it once in a blue moon i wonder why do i even do it at all if i dont like the consequences ... maybe im just thinking all this because im sick and hungover ... but the sad thing of all this is that i probably wouldnt stop myself from doing it again ... that scares me ... who is gonna stop me before i go overboard ...no one but myself ...

      my old posts ae like so depressing and im so moody ... is that because of the winter ... or is it because i was with adam ... and i had drama problems ... but im like so happy likereally ryan makes me happy ... but like adam made me happy once .. i wish that i relized how stupid adam was when i was with him ... cuz wow its like now i can see how bad he aws treating me ... and like im a stupid bitch hmm ... and like all i do is bitch ... o well lol i have to go now cuz ... im gonna find somehting to do ok  read these lyrics  love ya     And we wait above a road. We're turning to go home. And the silence from the side of the car, Tells me everything and how we are.  Is there no more trying to make this so right. Theres no more trying tonight.  And you know it's not so easy when you're all alone,  And I wonder if, I'm alone in your head.   I know something is wrong,  I just don't know what to do.  You say it's only me, and, that I'm so perfect for you.  I don't want to try no more,  I don't want to make this right. I just want you to be true to me one time.   And you know it's not so easy when you're all alone,  And I wonder if I'm alone in your head.   Twelve days gone by, since I have saw you last,  I'll give this one more try,  I'll give it all my best, and, I'll ask  What could you be doing that is so much fun? Without me by your side, Without me by your side. And, I will take a step back, and, I'll let you ahead,  And, I will take a step away, and, see if you come back, Because there's no more trying to make this so right,  Theres no more trying, Theres no more trying tonight.   We will never be the same,  We will never be the same,  We will never be the same, We will never be the same,  Until you're done.

      o man check htis shiznet out   ok well wow so much stff now im tweaking later i will go into more detaisl but ill define it by a few lyrics a few poems       Emo Girl She’s just an emo girl  Stuck in her own cruel world  A tough outer shell  With a deep inner hell  She’s waiting for her savoir to come   She thinks she has a good beat  Just like every one you meet  Another stand-out face in the crowd  That’ll shout it out loud  She’s waiting for her savoir to come   The stereotypical picture  Of a rock-punk golden mixture  Her attitude it never dies  But still inside she cries and cries  She’s waiting for her savior to come   I think that everybody knows  The pain inside that she withholds  With all the anger, hurt, and sin  That she does not keep within   She’s just an emo girl  Stuck in her own cruel world  A tough outer shell  With a deep inner hell  She’s waiting for her savoir to come      and this....   We're so nice sitting very still, in a room where no one else can feel the pain  that breaks my heart each day, I'm not ok. Sunlight shining through my window, let's me know that I'm still alive Why did I ever let you inside my heart? I'm such a fool. Paint my face in shades of blood and grey and take a seat right next to me But I should have known that you were a killer. But now I'm dead.  A gaping hole, shot through my heart A lost connection from your poison dart Shot from your tounge to end my life.  You're blowing at the fire to light your strife.  You'll never know. The hardest thing about dying is, knowing you'll never see the light of day.  A gaping hole...(shot through my heart) A lost connection from your poison dart. My head now spins and my ears bleed gold. I try so fucking hard, but I can't fit your mold.  The hardest thing about dying is knowing you'll never see the light of day(x2)  You ripped my heart out, you tore my eyes out, now you're gonna pay I'll stab you one time. I'll eat your heart out so you feel my pain.  Don't you know that I always see you in all of my dreams? I wanna kill you. I wanna kill you now.(x2) I'm insane.   AND THIS...  We're so nice sitting very still, in a room where no one else can feel the pain  that breaks my heart each day, I'm not ok. Sunlight shining through my window, let's me know that I'm still alive Why did I ever let you inside my heart? I'm such a fool. Paint my face in shades of blood and grey and take a seat right next to me But I should have known that you were a killer. But now I'm dead.  A gaping hole, shot through my heart A lost connection from your poison dart Shot from your tounge to end my life.  You're blowing at the fire to light your strife.  You'll never know. The hardest thing about dying is, knowing you'll never see the light of day.  A gaping hole...(shot through my heart) A lost connection from your poison dart. My head now spins and my ears bleed gold. I try so fucking hard, but I can't fit your mold.  The hardest thing about dying is knowing you'll never see the light of day(x2)  You ripped my heart out, you tore my eyes out, now you're gonna pay I'll stab you one time. I'll eat your heart out so you feel my pain.  Don't you know that I always see you in all of my dreams? I wanna kill you. I wanna kill you now.(x2) I'm insane.   OMG SOO MANY CONFLICTING EMOTIONS I WANT EVERYTHING TO BE HAPPY I WANNA BE WITH ADAM AND BE FREIDNS WITH ANDRREW AND HEATHER AND AIJA AND LYNN AND EVERYONE TO BE FUCKIN HAPPY ANGET ALONG INSTEAD OF MY FUCKING HYPERVENTALATING BECAUSE I MISS SOMONE SOO MUCH I CANT TALK TO THEM AND I STUTTER AND DONT I HATE MY SELF FOR FUCKING EVERYTHING UP I JUST WANNA JUMP OFF A BRIDGE AND GO BACK IN TIME AND MAKE EVERYTHING GOOD AGAIN

      Sagittarius    ...With Scorpio         NOT A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN       Definition of Marriage  Love isn't love unless it is expressed;  caring isn't caring unless the other person knows; sharing isn't sharing unless the other person is included;  Loving, caring, and sharing can make for a very happy marriage.    LOVE AND MARRIAGE       These two are so unlike as to make one wonder whatever could have been the attraction for either of them in the first place.  If it was a strictly a physical attraction it is not likely to last for one whole season much less a lifetime.  Scorpio is the type who lives to possess the ones he/she loves and to manipulate them in anyway he/she chooses.  This would not set well with the freedom loving, independent Sagittarius who refuses to be tied down or restricted in any way.  All of Scorpios attempts in this direction would be wasted on this personality.      It is almost impossible for any one person to tame this one as he/she will chase excitement, adventure, and the opposite sex with equal abandon.  Scorpio would have to handle the finances, and the risks that Sagittarius takes daily would soon have Scorpio a nervous wreck.  There is no way that Sagittarius will ever be a reasonable, serious person no matter how hard Scorpio tries to turn him/her into one.      If Sagittarius gets the impression that he/she is thought of as the exclusive sexual property of Scorpios, and it would be unwise for Scorpio to act as if this is so, that is when he/she begins to kick over the traces and will go bed-hopping.  This is an unlikely alliance and not a match made in Heaven.     BUSINESS PARTNERSHIPS      This would also be an unwise business partnership for much the same reasons as outlined above. Sagittarius will be much too busy searching out the excitement in the business and will work at it willingly, unless it becomes a hum drum affair at which time he is likely to lose interest in the whole thing. Scorpio is not as adept at dealing with the public for he is apt to sting those who can help and cultivate those that can harm the business. Not a recommended business partnership.

Better scenes... I wish you'd seen me  Better off if I just let it be  Better pretend it don't matter  Better off if I could have her  Better days since the day I met her  I'd better hope she got my letters  Better off in two year stretches

      now im gonna share with you wat is going through my head right now unless i get interrupted with my thoughts ...   this afternoon as i was walking home i had a sudden thought that arose in my head ... it wasnt a good one it was more of a preminition of sorts ... but not totally ... i dont really no what it was ... more of a sinking feeling in my stomach about this summer... not that o man its gonna suck cuz its gonna be boring more of a tragety or death occuring something earth shattering and life changing ... i dunno realy what it was but it really hit me ... it hit my like being punch in the stomach the wind was knocked out of me ... i really dont no what made me come to this conclusion of tragety ... but it hit hard something that felt familiar ... like hollowness as if i lost a part of myself ... and as i sit here and think about how much i want somone to take me away from my thoughts ... the thoughts that have been continueing sense saturday night ... thoughts that are familiar and hollow ... it hurts for me to think about them ... and why was i even thinking them ... no its not some ex bf or shit like that its deeper than that ... i hate that has consumed me for as long as i can remember and it started to lash out again ... but why what brought this upon ... maybe the excess of drugs or excess of not caring and it was a way for my body to send chills of awakening into me ... for that i really dont no ... but i really hope that i never have to think that again ... its such a cold and hollow feeling ... i will never be good enough i always knew i would never be able to be an awesome person to myself but now i fear that i cant be an awesome person to anyone else and maybe tahts nothing to some of you ... but thats all i got ... thats what im good at i am a people person and i cant be fucking off and sayingi dont care because its gonna fuck with my people person abilities that i pride my self on ... my ability to get along with everyone and now that ive been fucking around and stepping on who ever the fuck i want and only caring about my self and my problems i think that i have hurt more than i should have ... for what me to be happy ... its only a hollow happiness and it makes me sick ...    yea thats what i was thinking about when i was walking home and im gonna try to fix this shit over the summer this is wat im gonna do   * study for sats  * get permit  * apply to some jobs * get a job * work out for cross country  * look kick ass for next school year * become a better person and more considerate of others and their feelings   i think thats it ...  ill add more to wat i see fit and ill start writing down my times for running and my weight and everything so i can keep track im gonna really redo my self this summer an dim gonn be better .. .no mater what...

My friend,  You're always the last one to leave those dimly lit rooms Making sure the last glass makes it's way to the table empty  And every bottle in the place has been upside down At least a few times What a waste Is this what's left of you these days?  You're not 18 anymore 5 years should have been enough time For you to grow up and get over this It's not too cool  To be throwing up all morning  Sick from what you might have done or done it with  I swear,  If I could take your pain and frame it and hang it on my wall Maybe you wouldnever have to hurt at all I'm painting pictures in red and blue A portrait bruised just like you And now you're walking away  You're not 18 anymore 5 years should have been enough time For you to grow up and get over this It's not too cool  To be throwing up all morning  Sick from what you might have done or done it with  When is enough finally enough? All the hang-ups and heartbreaks get you past all failures and bad breaks Just accept yourself Find something that brings you closer to complete  Painting pictures in red and blue A portrait bruised just like you And now you're walking away  You're not 18 anymore 5 years should have been enough time For you to grow up and get over this It's not too cool  To be throwing up all morning  Sick from what you might have done or done it with  When is enough finally enough? When is enough finally enough?

      what's up dude? I'm getting kind of bored let's get some food and then hit movies 4 what's going on?whats up with all our friends? let's start a rumor just to find out where it ends  cause a small town is like a small stage for teenagers and their drama  instead of playing shows, we'll be showing plays like 90210 without the beverly hills  well, don't you think it's high time what we never settle down well, don't you think it's high time that we get out of this town cause if we leave then we just might be okay  hoopes i did it again i messed everything up, and i think i hurt my friends hoopes i did it again relationships that work are things that i can't comprehend  ohio has the flavor of a water chestnut it's not too crazy and it's not the best but we're not setting forest fires just out of boredom i'd rather see a movie if in fact i can afford one  well, don't you think it's high time that we never settle down well don't you think it's high time  that we get out of this town cause if we leave then we just might make a difference and if we leave then we just might be okay and i don't think it would hurt to get away  dan bakitus said i'm shallow he said i've got no integrity but, i don't know dan bakitus and dan bakitus, he don't know me  cause we always sayin canton you can't enoy(canton joy) yourself well, there's thruth to that but may i add it's not half bad and never less than that.

      i'd really like to see you there i can't pretend like i don't care because i really do, yeah please just kill the drama go to sleep we'll talk tomorrow dream about me, and don't worry  we'll be fine  can you hear me can you see me what i don't know  cannot hurt me can you hear me can you see me what i don't know  cannot hurt me  i'm turning around i'm turning around, i'm turning it up, i'm taking it out i'm turning around, i'm falling apart, i'm hitting the ground i'm turning around, i'm turning it up, i'm taking it out i'm turing around, i'm falling apart, i'm hitting the ground  if you said that you were leaving i'd ask where we were going do you really, because i really do want everything to work out like the motion picture ending it's what i really meant to say  can you hear me can you see me what i don't know cannot hurt me can you hear me can you see me what i don't know cannot hurt me  i'm turning around i'm turning around, i'm turning it up, i'm taking it out i'm turing around, i'm falling apart, i'm hitting the ground i'm turing around, i'm turing it up, i'm taking it out i'm turing around, i'm falling apart, i'm hitting the ground  what i don't know cannot hurt me   spitalfield - kill the drama  We all know the girls that I am talking about. Well they are time bombs and they are ticking And the only questions when...they'll blow up! And they'll blow up, we know that without a doubt. Cause they're those girls, yeah, you know those girls That let their emotions get the best of them. GO!!!  And I've contrived some sort of a plan To help my fellow man...  Let's get emotional girls to all wear mood rings So we'll be tipped off to when they're ticked off Cause we'll know just what they're thinking, Just what they're thinking...  She's so pretty but she doesn't always act that way Emotions swinging on the swingset almost everyday She said to me that she's so happy it's depressing And all I said was "Someone get that girl a mood ring!"  If it's drama you want, then look no further They're like the Real World meets Boy Meets World  meets Days of Our Lives. And it just kills me how they get away with murder They'll anger you then bat their eyes Those pretty eyes that watch you sympathize GO!!!  And I've contrived some sort of a plan To help my fellow man...  Let's get emotional girls to all wear mood rings So we'll be tipped off to when they're ticked off Cause we'll know just what they're thinking, Just what they're thinking...  She's so pretty but she doesn't always act that way Emotions swinging on the swingset almost everyday She said to me that she's so stressed out that it's soothing And all I said was "Someone get that girl a mood ring!"  Cause when it's black  means "watch your back" because you're probably The last person in the world right now she wants to see And when it's blue it means you should call her up immediatly and ask her out because she'll most likely agree And when it's green it simply means that she is really stressed And when it's clear it means she's completely emotionless And that's alright I must confess  We all know the girls that I am talking about She likes you Wednesday, but now it's Friday And she has to wash her hair And it just figures that we'll never figure them out Well, first she's Jekyll and then she's Hyde... at least she makes a lovely pair.  Mood Ring, oh Mood Ring,  oh tell me will you bring the key To unlock this mystery? Of girls and their emotions Play it back in slow motion So I may understand The complex infrastucture known as the female mind    relient k - mood ring

      i really dont ... this is ridiculous i dunno ... it makes me sick ... just everything im so sad right now... i just want somone to talk to i wanna go out for a walk and just have an awesome good talk but everyone is sick of all my stories that make no sense ... and sick of all my stupid anicdotes that are just plain ridiculous ... why cant i find somone to talk to me they dont like to talk they just listen and then they get sick of me talking ... teh i duno i just wanna talk to somone i wanna hear somones input on anything but watever... im just sad  I picked you out Of a crowd and talked to you. Said I liked your shoes, You said, "Thanks, Can I follow you?"  So it's up the stairs,  And out of view. No prying eyes. I poured some wine. I asked your name;  You asked the time.  Now it's two o'clock. The club is closed, We are up the block. Your hands are on me, Pressing hard against your jeans, Your tongue in my mouth,  Trying to keep the words from coming out, You didn't care to know Who else may have been you before.  I want a lover I don't have to love, I want a girl who's too sad to give a fuck. Where's the kid with the chemicals? I thought he said to meet him here,  But I'm not sure. I've got the money  If you've got the time. He said, "It feels good." I said "I'll give it a try."  Then my mind went dark, We both forgot where your car was parked. Let's just take the train. I'll meet up with the band in the morning  Bad actors, with bad habits... Some sad singers, they just play tragic. And the phone is ringing,  And the van is leaving Let's just keep touching, Let's just keep...keep singing  I want a lover I don't have to love, I want a boy who's so drunk he doesn't talk. Where's the kid with the chemicals? I got a hunger and I can't seem to get full. I need some meaning I can memorize. The kind I have always seems to slip my mind.  But you, but you...  You write such pretty words,  But life's no storybook. Love's an excuse to get hurt. And to hurt.  Do you like to hurt? I do, I do. Then hurt me, Then hurt me, Then hurt me...  - Bright Eyes

to leave at like i duno 415 which was cool i like hanging out with him but he was all tired from his adventure with chad which wasnt cool ...   so then it was just me aija and chad and we played tarot cards and like i guess bad shit is gonna happen ... teh nothing new i suppose ... and we fucked up chads cards so his was all like death and stuff lol and then we sat out and watched some of shainghi knights or watever then we left the house at like i udnno 530 so we left to go to the beach but chad totally wasnt havin it so he just went home to go and "sleep" teh watever lol uhh so we left to the beach and forgot you need money to get and see the shitty fireworks ... so we had to get a ride back with aijs cousin chase ... and we didnt get one back which was geyyy lol so we like chilled there and met up with like a shit load of people and like jen dexter is due next tuesday and we saw jeanna and she is already showing ... i dunno it was weird ... so whatever like i dunno wha else happened it must not have been important so then like i dunno jamie like ditched us or watever i dunno and we ended up watching fireworks with will but not all of then cuz like we spent half the time looking for aijas dad anyways ...   the fireworks sucked  but watever so then we went to wills car cuz the fireworks were over and we were gonna be like insominiac and do all this crazy shit ... so we went to

(its had to of been quarter of midnight) ok so then like o yea a pic of me and aija molesting teddy bears lol ... and then aija climbed into on of the freezers in price chopper and we closed the door and took a pic of her lol it was so funnie so then we like ran outta there ... and were out side and will was like i wanna push somone in a carrage so i jumpedinto a shoping cart and will pushed me and like let me go and i was all (by aija):"pussy and scarreed, and i suck garretts balls and they taste really good..." like o man holy shit dont let me crash into the cart thingy so will stoped it and then like i was getting out and aija like grabed it and like shook it and i almost fell and will took a pic of that lol so like there was somone parked in the parking lot with their lights on so

       Shakedown 1979, cool kids never have the timeOn a live wire right up off the streetYou and I should meetJunebug skipping like a stoneWith the headlights pointed at the dawnWe were sure we’d never see an end to it allAnd I don’t even care to shake these zipper bluesAnd we don’t knowJust where our bones will restTo dust I guessForgotten and absorbed into the earth belowDouble cross the vacant and the boredThey’re not sure just what we have in the storeMorphine city slippin dues down to seeThat we don’t even care as restless as we areWe feel the pull in the land of a thousand guiltsAnd poured cement, lamented and assuredTo the lights and towns belowFaster than the speed of soundFaster than we thought we’d go, beneath the sound of hopeJustine never knew the rules,Hung down with the freaks and the ghoulsNo apologies ever need be made, I know you better than you fake itTo see that we don’t care to shake these zipper bluesAnd we don’t know just where our bones will restTo dust I guessForgotten and absorbed into the earth belowThe street heats the urgency of soundAs you can see there’s no one around           i just wanted to put these lyrics hin herebecause it reminded me of good times with good friends ... good friends i no longer have ...           smashing pumpkin - 1979          good effin song  ...   i wish i could go back sometimes but other times i wish i could never look back ...
