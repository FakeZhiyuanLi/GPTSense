       Why on earth can't I make better choices for myself. I mean, I know what to do, eat an apple not a bag of candy, call people back instead of watching TV (that's how you make friends), go to class, do the homework. Why on earth can't I do these things when I know I will be happier in the end.   I think there might be a secret conspiracy going on in my subconscience to ruin me!!! It has to be 'cause I know better.   I will get to the bottom of this!!!

       What is with Guns and God, I mean really. What part of the bible say "Thou shall carry firearms and smite all those that appose ye firearm." Now mind you I haven't attended a christian based church in years but have read and owned a bible and I am pretty sure I never crossed that verse.    This comes about because I was at the hospital the other day (reason is unimportant) and there is this old yellow boat of a car parked by mine. On the back window there are three stickers. The first one is huge and in the center of the window it reads    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Jesus saves"    &nbsp;All fine and good.    The second sticker in the lower left reads    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Guns cause violence like flys cause garbage."    Okay things wrong with this sticker are that no flys do not cause garbage they make maggots, much like guns don't cause violence, the crazys that can so readily get guns do.    The final sticker in the lower right corner read    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Guns, God and guts keep America free."&nbsp;    I laugh when I&nbsp;share that one with my friends. It is just so ridiculous.    So I left a note on the persons car, it read    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many guns would Jesus&nbsp;own?"    Because real&nbsp;Jesus didn't save with weapon or violence or acts of war,&nbsp;he just had faith and let that belief guide him to do what was kind and decent.    I am not a&nbsp;Christian but I think the bible is an interesting book. Its just to bad that most people don't get it and then kill other because of it. &nbsp;

        So beginning is usually the easy part for me. Its fininshing and ending that I such at.   I am at my parents today and was gettting bored. This looked interesting or at least self-absorbing.  Things to know about me. I am a mechanical engineering student, that is a single mother and a recovering herion addict. So much of my life is referenced to these things. I am not very technology literate and am not sure if this will even become something or if that then, become something of interest.  Lately I feel I am missing something. That I have lost a deepth or an excitement in my life.  I will not begin a quest to get it back. Though I don't now what or how, I will find it.
