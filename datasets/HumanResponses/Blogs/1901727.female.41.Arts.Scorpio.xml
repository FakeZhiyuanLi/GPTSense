        I have an important announcement...I'm leaving NC to become a Pirate.  No...you can't change my mind, so don't waste yer time, me hardy. The sea calls to me. I must go pillage and plunder the 7 Seas.  heh heh I'm silly. The insolent lad sent me a quiz to find out my pirate name. Here's the results:   Dirty Charity Read      You're the pirate everyone else wants to throw in the ocean -- not to get rid of you, you understand; just to get rid of the smell. Even through many pirates have a reputation for not being the brightest souls on earth, you defy the sterotypes. You've got taste and education.

        One more for the road, then I'm off to bed. It's been a very long day.  The poem about the Shoe dropping... is for my friend Robert. He has his own blog Sometimepoet... he's having to move from his home of 8 years I think.. 7 or 8, he told me but I forgot. He's alone and very sad. He's lived there for so long. So many memories.   My heart goes out to him. Change is always scary. I keep reminding him that he isn't alone. He has people who care about him and that though change is often unwanted, it is also sometimes for the best, as long as we don't fight it. Change can make us or break us.   What would I do if I suddenly had to leave my home in 30 days? It's a frightening thought.  Hang in there, R.  (((Hugs, sweetie)))

      I was in the kitchen but this comment from a commerial on HBO about their original...groudbreaking series Deadwood, caught my ears.  "Will you let me get to hell my own way"  I may not have the quote down perfectly. But it had me thinking for a while.  I prefer to say  "Will you take me to heaven your way"  Sounds more inviting I think  ;)

        I'm in a spiritual realm tonight.  The mood has been brought on by many things today. But mainly, the mood is here because lately I've been digging deep inside myself. At 41, I am finally at peace with who I am. There is a calmness inside me that hasn't been there before. A willingness to take life and actually stop and look at what's around me, savoring whatever haiku moments are there.  Whether it's Ben's little wrinkled raisin toes after his bath or the perfect shade of carmine that one of my roses radiated today.   I've finally learned that I can rely on myself and if my goals are set properly, I'll reach them. If I exhale negativity, my whole outlook on life will be better for it. So I exhale and I keep living.  I don't know what my tomorrow looks like. I'm too busy looking at now and imprinting it on my soul.  Life is good. I am living. I am alive and I know love.  How many of you can say that? If you can't...then you need to do your own soul searching, my friend.

        The shoe dropped today. Will the other follow soon, you wonder. Maybe you're thinking of taking if off before it does. But don't fret, bakerman. Being barefoot has its rewards. You'll get to run through clover like a Spring Faun. It will be tough at first, your feet are tender. But soon, the stones and cracks you have to walk on won't hurt at all. You'll find freedom sings without the shoes. if you can keep your soul song now and believe.  ~ ~ ~ ~ Hugs to Robert.

        Above the magnolia sits Sirius, So majestic on a serious night. Brilliant diamond in the sky’s tiara, Does Sirius mind that I dance with sin? I spend hours with lust, wildly waltzing In perfect step with ecstasy’s music.  Butterfly soft plays sin’s haunting music. Do you feel the tempo, stern Sirius? Look high above you, small stars are waltzing. They’re radiance is sizzling dark’s night. To ignore their beauty is such a sin. See proud Sirius…Heaven’s tiara?  Sirens yearn to kidnap night’s tiara Because its luster dulls their charmed music. Even in the deep blue ocean lurks sin. How can you be so blind, sad Sirius To the serpentine charms of my midnight, While I sinuously enjoy waltzing.  In my mosaic dreams, we are waltzing. I wear nudity like a tiara. My Sirius of the serious night Follow the rhythm of wanton music. I am your gilded violet, Sirius. In sultry heat, I’ll wilt within your sin.  Deliciously, I wear your carnal sin, As we meld as one in fervor, waltzing. You shine your brightest, lover Sirius, Outshining diamonds in a tiara. Lust is a maestro directing music. Like a shooting star we burn up the night.  How does a dream survive the dark of night? Reality plays its bitter music, As I remain alone with lusty sin. The music has stopped. There is no waltzing. To sirens, I give my jaded tiara. Even their song can’t move Sirius.  Music is the heart of a tempest night. Someday may Sirius join me in sin. I’ll keep waltzing and wear hope’s tiara.  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  Yesterday at dusk, William (my 5-yr-old nephew) and I were outside doing some weeding...or rather I was doing the weeding. He was playing Superman. I saw the Quarter Moon, smiling above the house and pointed it out to him.  Then I saw Venus, shining so brightly.   I said, "See that light, William. That's Venus."  He disagreed, "No, that's a star, Aunt Sherrie."  And there was Sirius, looking sternly out over the pines...and a poem is born.

        I got the mail when I got off work but had to hustle to a meeting of sorts. When I got home I had dinner and then goofed off for a few mins.  Got on line and chatted a bit with Robert. He's another Publish America published poet. His book is called "Sometime Poet." (I'll send you a bill for the plug, Robert).  And after we chatted I tried to work on my website but the page builder kept sticking. I went into the kitchen a few mins ago to get some milk and cookies--those pecan sandies.. yum! I shuffled through the mail...and there was my Publish America Contract.   See what happens when you're in a hurry...you miss important things. I read through it (was like the one I downloaded) and signed it. It's in a big envelope, waiting for postage....  Signed, sealed...and waiting to be delivered.... I'm yours (PA)!

        I see you, Day Moon, white lost in blue As the afternoon sun burns clouds in the sky. Do you see me, looking up at you,  Wearing a sheer cotton dress of pale butter? Or am I lost in the midst of spring blooms?  Daylight was born in a peach of light,  Spreading glow across the tops of the distant hills. I traveled far by night, following the blaze of Venus. I saw you, slipping away to hid from dawn. Yet, hours later, you returned to frighten the sun.  I love you, Day Moon. See me, know me, For the night has left us both to face the day. We are lost souls—souls that know darkness And seek the shelter of shadows and mist. We dance with the fears of humanity.  Oh moon of daytime, my husband of stone, Seek the warm of my shadows, of my secret pathway. Claim the rites that many men fail to discover, For you are the heart that beats inside me, The breath that passes over my lips as I sigh.  It is now the afternoon and shadows draw out shadows. Listen to my song, Day Moon, for I fear that you will falter, And be lured by the glimmer of nighttime stars. I can not compete with their brilliance,  My sheer dress will not cloak their light with me.  Your round face is a mist of white moving in the indigo night, As the last morsel of dusk is gobbled up by the return of Venus. My love, my heart, my Day Moon, I see you  change by night, As the stars steal you away for the evening show of grandeur. I will travel until  you find me again, in afternoon delight.   ~ ~ ~*~ ~ ~  I see the moon during the day and imagine it is my lover, the one whose heart beats because of my kiss, looking down at me...and I know the real meaning of erotic heat... when I feel the intensity of the moon's rare stare in daytime.

        Dreaming foaming waves of the sea, You are forever moving to and fro, Never staying for long.   My lips kiss salt.  To the sea I trekked, to see eternity, As it washes over alabaster sand In guise of the determined tide.  My footprints fade.  Where are you, man-o-war? Lurking under white caps? Will your sting be my death, agonizing and extended? Or shall you float away nonchalantly?  My heart stings.  Upon the sand I sit, a dreaming starfish cracked. My feet cut by the shards of mosaic shells, The dividers of ocean and sand.  My eyes drip salt. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~    I was thinking how very "Sherrie" this poem is.  People ask where do my images come from, as with any writer or poet, I draw from what I know.    I know the sea.

      I emailed a friend today in reply to an email. I mentioned how I saw a strange sight this morning as I got into my truck to head to work. A carpenter bee was buzzing a blue jay that stood under the oak tree. It was too close to the barn I keep things in and under....(it has shelters). A million and one carpenter bees are making their nests in the wood.  Like slow fat samuri, the carpenter bee kept buzzing the bird until the bird caved in and flew away. I was amazed that the bird didn't attack the bee. I realized the tenacity of the insect is what beat the bird's defiance down to zero. I was thinking...maybe I should be tenacious as the carpenter bee, flying at people's heads until they run away...recognizing that I am Queen Bee.  I think I am a wise woman. lol

      I feel as if I've lived Friday three times over this week. Am I in a time warp, destined to feel the same day... over and over?   Today is not such a bad day. I've got my orders ready for tomorrow finished. And am ahead of the incoming week. Good for ole SherBear!  That's what my brother calls me. SherBear  Al used to call me that too. But my brother's called me that the longest.   Al...his birthday is June 11. A part of me keeps saying to send him a card or note, but I know if I do, he'll think I want him back and it will only hurt him in the end.   Even though it's been 5 years, I still have things to resolve about him. But they are things I can do alone. So if I mention him here, just realize that its beause he's on my mind...not because he's in my heart. He's not anymore...at least not in a room with an open door.    I stuck him and the clutter from our past together into a cigarbox. He's on a shelf somewhere, gathering dust and mildew.  Enough of the past... it's a holiday weekend here. I'll work tomorrow but plan to be lazy Sunday and Monday. I'm sure I'll find time to slip in here and dribble a thought across the pages.

       ...so I'm having a drink of water and a smile.   Today is Thursday but it feels like Friday.  Since Mom's been at my house on 'off' days, my week has been turned upside down. Her fiance, John had hip replacement surgery last week and has been in a rehab center in Fayetteville. He's due back home tomorrow. Mom will stay with him then.  I've got to work Saturday, so there goes a trip to the beach. A friend of mine asked if I wanted to go to Wilmington. The down-side is that she's leaving Friday afternoon late and staying until Monday afternoon. Sorry but I don't want to be there that long. I need my quiet time on Sunday. I'm used to having a quiet afternoon then.   Let's see...what's up with me...  I'm reading Stephen King's book On Writing. Excellent read. I recommend it to all writers. I think that man can take any topic and make it entertaining.  My poetry book's edited and ready to slip back to the publisher. Someone asked me why PA? Why go with a print-on-demand company? Why? Well for one thing, its easy to do. And it puts my favorite poems in a book, one that family and friends can enjoy. One that I can show off. And another reason is that having a published book might make it easier to get a better publishing deal, if I decide to pursue it. I look at it as adding a knotch on my resume.  (Grin)   I watched the final Lord of The Rings Movie-- Return of the King  last night. Greatness! Complete greatness! I've ordered the books from half.com and they're on the way here. I had a complete set but gave them to Allen. He read them over and over during the 4 years we were together.   The Captain's Verses  by Pablo Neruda came today. I can't wait to take a long drink of his poems. It is Thirstday and if anyone can quench a thirst, it is Pablo Neruda.  :)

      Dad dare me to do something today. We actually had a good laugh over it. He was sitting at the front, watching people park their cars. Three elderly ladies got out of a car. All had on straw hats. Two of the hats looked great. But the other one...she had on a gold and rust dress with a magenta straw hat. It was ghastly.   Dad said, "Sherrie, put on one of your hats and walk down the street with them."   I laughed and said, "Ok."   He looked surprised, "You're gonna do it??"  As an answer, I grabbed a black bowler type felt hat with a huge yellow sunflower on it. Walked outside and mingled with them. They were looking at the pictures in our window. Then we strolled down the street. One kept looking at me, like I was strange. I think it was my outfit. I have on a brighly colored tie-dye shirt of yellow, orange, red, blue and purple with mesh nylon pants--black with a white pin stripe. I definitely looked like a hippy and loafers. I walked with them into the men's store beside us and I wish you could have seen Wes's (the son of the owners) face. It was priceless. I turned around and came back to the studio. Dad was howling with laughter.  When the ladies drove off, I put on the hat and went next-door. I asked Wes which of us won the best hat contest.   He said, "You did."  "But what about the magenta hat? Didn't she look prettier."  "The pink hat was cool. But you still win the best hat contest. The yellow flower gives you an edge."  I smiled. "Don't you mean my tie-dye shirt?"  He grinned, "Yeah, I do."  So it's official folks, I won the Best Hat Award on Hat Day.

      I've studied Tarot cards for over two years now. And I'm still learning about the card daily. My favorite deck is the Universal Rider-Waite-Smith Deck. The images are more colorful and not so orangy as the regular RWS deck.   Below is a sample reading I did for my friend Sam on May 12. He said I could post it and his remarks. ~ ~ ~~ ~  Card pulled for Reading:  The Six of Wands —This is a victory card! Very positive.    Your Past — The Page of Cups : He brings messages of new love or rekindling an old love.  Your Now — The Empress : A seed planted sprouts and will bear fruit.   The King of Wands crosses the Empress . (He is a married man, kind and full of ideas. A man of power who delegates duties—maybe your boss? He could be the man behind your success. Or… he’s pregnant. The Empress is fertile.)  Your future — The Two of Pentacles :  Trying to juggle more than one thing, trying to find a balance. Though this is difficult, you do it with jovially.  The environment of the Future — The Chariot :  Sheer force of will drives your destiny. You are in control of your path. This is an action card and it tells me that you have control of your destiny.  Your outcome card — The Three of Pentacles :  This card is about planning, working together as a group. It can also mean that you are applying what you’ve learned and venturing on your own in a new enterprise. (my note to him: Sam, how's this reading? I'm in doubt tonight.) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ His Reply: DO NOT DOUBT!  That said, the reading was absolutely frickin' perfect. to whit; I have just spent 1000 dollars to get some comics graded so I can begin to sell some on ebay. I got this idea from the guy I have been working for. He's having a little difficulty because he went a little overboard so he's used me very sparingly over the last couple of months, and he not only suggested that in essence I become his competition, he actually got me a deal worked out with the grading company that is exactly the same as his. I am trying to do more than one thing at this time. I'm doing that, working the shops like normal but have also begun selling some regular comics online at this point to start the re-couping of the monies already put out. I'm excited so I am happy. :)

      JS,a friend of mine stopped by to chat for a few mins today. He took his son to see Shrek 2 and said that  "there are jokes especially for you... I won't ruin it for you...but you'll know...the line...'I don't have anything to rub'...I couldn't help but think of you when I heard it. ;)"   Guess I'll have to go see it now. Thanks J for the heads up!

       I love to blog. No one may read me, but I still enjoy it. Writing down ideas and scattered thoughts frees my mind and lightens my soul.  I know a few people who are blogging too. And... I can't believe I talked my dear friend, Sara to try her hand at blogging. She seems to like it, so far. In fact she told me it is addictive. I agree...it is.  I think  EVERYONE  should blog.

        The reunion was fun. Everything went smoothly and... Mom and I are in charge of it again next year. No one would volunteer to take over for next year.  I don't mind, in a way. I've got the addresses and the forms saved to a file in my PC at home.   This year, Granny and I didn't drive over to the old cemetery to check on the graves there. Several of her newborn babies are buried there, along with my Grandfather. It's a small cemetery on a little hill.  I'm very tired today. As usual, I was elected to take all the kids outside for a game of dodge ball. I was the one who was tossing the beach ball at them. William and one of the other boys, Eric I think, wanted to go into the wooded area. But I told them it had snakes, spiders and tigers in it. That kept them away but... it scared Ben and little Avery, a boy that ironically is in Ben's class. While William and Eric played tag, the little ones and I stood before the wooded area and shouted, "We aren't afraid of tigers." Then we would growl.   It was really hot out, even in the shaded area we were playing in. I wore sandals with 2 inch inches... not good for playing in. Today my feet are sore. And I feel washed out. I probably got too hot.  A part of me whispers that I'm tired from the aftermath of being stressed out all month. That could be true. I think I need a good 9 hours of solid sleep.  An interesting side note--outside the church in two different areas were dragonflies. One group was at the side entrance. They were blue and swarming around. Ben and I counted 10. Then at a tree close to the highway was a huge swarm of green dragonflies. We couldn't count them all. I'm assuming it's mating season. I've never seen so many in one place. I took some pictures. I'll have to make a photo album on my website.  I have a few other things to write about if I don't forget. I'll try to get to them by tomorrow.

      Duality is something I fight daily. I am a Libra/Scorpio--my head and my heart are always in conflict. So is the poet and writer inside of me. I've worn my poetry hat for the last 5 months and now my writer's hat is dying to slip on my head. Maybe that's why I've been struggling to write poetry of late. Because I have stories inside, fighting to get on paper.  Hopefully, my poetry book will be ready to send back to PA by Monday or Tuesday at the latest. Once its submitted, I can sit back and work on my prose, until I've written out the stories that need to find life and  breathe.

      I have no idea who sent this quote to my 'junkmail acct.' The acct was from excite.com. When I replied, the email was returned with a notice that said, "user not Known." There wasn't any other context or any fishy looking links, only the quote.    Violet Winspear wrote many Harlequinn Romance Novels under various aliases. I started reading them at 15 and stopped at 17. I moved on to Stephen King. haha Anyway, here's the quote:   "To be the center of another person's existence is the perfect dream, and the romantic novel sets out to provide this dreamlike experience. The reader is no fool. She has the security of husband, lover, or career, but deep in most feminine (and masculine) hearts there is this dream of being loved until the end of time, with a great and caring passion that never falters."  -Violet Winspear

         A Novel Romance  Breathlessly I was drawn into a dizzy passion-filled world  The Scoundrel and the Hellcat  As I read, I felt my bodice rip.  ~ ~ ~ * ~ ~ ~   In 2002, I wrote this poem after walking by a romance novel display.  The book that caught my eye was called The Scoundrel and The Hellcat. The cover had a man whose hair was more beautiful that the woman who was swooning in his arms. I think her bodice was held up by drool, because he was looking at her as if she were dessert.  I heard a rip and realized... my bodice was torn. See what happens when you get to close to those romance novels.

        My brother John had an ophthalmology appointment this morning at 11:45. He has glaucoma. It's ironic, how for years our ophthalmologist thought for sure I was going to develop glaucoma. But so far I haven't. Though I do have ocular hypertension (high pressure in my eyes).  After his appointment, we stopped for lunch at Jimmy's Seafood Restaurant. It was yum-icious!  Most of you know that my brother was born with cerebral palsy. It effects his motor skills but not his mind. He's always walked on crutches. It's all he knows. So... after the meal, I gave him his crutches and walked to the register. Once there I realized that I had left the check on the table and called to John to bring it to me.   As he was weaving through the tables, the girl at the register said, "He has a hard life."  I looked around to see who she was talking about. But there wasn't anyone around but me, so pointing to John, I asked, "Are you talking about him?"   She replied, looking at him with pity, "Yes, poor man. We don't realize how good we've got things."   I almost let it drop but knew that I couldn't. "Don't feel sorry for him. He's 38 and has cerebral palsy. He was born that way, in other words. He's always used crutches."   We both watched John step aside so an elderly lady on a walker could get by him. I smiled at the girl. "He's not handicapped. How can he mourn something he's never lost?"  About that time, John came up with the check and apologized for taking so long. The girl smiled at him. I thought to myself how she'll look differently at those who were born different. Maybe, she'll no longer have pity. My hopes is that she'll look at them with admiration, like she did John today.

      I stayed up late working on my book, ordering the poems and making sure there were no silly misspellings and such.  So I slept until 11. Something I rarely do on Sundays.  Most people seem to like the choice #2 for my book cover. I'm not sure which I'll do yet. The wise decision is to separate the two and look at them individually. See which strikes my fancy.   Sunday are my lazy day. I cook a late lunch (today it's NY strips) and then do laundry as I do Tarot readings. In fact, when I log on later, I'll write about my Tarot studies.  Now... the grill is calling and the steaks are marinated.   Time to cook. :)

      (...is a random questions asked on the profiles--my very brief answer)  Once upon a time, there was a frog. His name was Bald Freddy Frog and he had no friends. He was all alone on his lily pad, croaking a solo. One day a spider heard his song and decided to weave a cobweb wig for him, so the other frogs would croak with him. Magically, Fred became popular because his hair caught flies. The End

        Wow.. Blogger's offering a wider variety of templates for the blogs.  I even paritally completed my profile. I'll fill in the rest of the blanks later.   I like the color. It's almost the same shade of lipstick I wear in the summer. (wink)  Back in September I started a blog called the Poetry Goddess. I posted maybe 5 or 6 times and never picked it up again. In fact, I deleted the blog when I started this one. I mainly posted a few thoughts on poetry and a poem or two.   When I got the idea to use the blog for 'promoting' myself, I knew that the Poetry Goddess Blog wasn't the proper tool. Thus a ..blog was born (A Sip of Sherrie).  I wasn't too keen on the look of the blog templates when I first joined. I think that's partly why I never could get into writing on this site. Since then I've learned a smidgen of html codes and have been able to change the look to fit me better...  I thank you Blogger.com for making this place a 'funner' place to write at.

        Last week we started having "Lunch Time on the Plaza."  The featured band was the D.A.R.E. band. (our local police department has a band).  They sounded okay. I didn't winch as they played for over an  hour like I have in the past. Our building is located close to the plaza area and from the back alley, the music drifts into our building and I can hear the band really good...even better than if I were standing in front of them.  Today's band was the  urlLink Coastline Band  and they are totally cool. They play oldies and beach music. My favorite song they performed today was "Mustang Sally."

         ...is the devil.   I've said this often in my other journal. Hewlett Packard and I have had a few fights over the quality of their printers. I'll save it for another day when I feel like ranting about them.  Today, I'll stand up to the plate and own up to my own mistake. I was talked into trying a new photo paper. According to specifications, the thickness should work with HP printers. WRONG... I knew better. And kicked myself as the paper promptly became jammed as I tried to print an order this morning. I'm not used to working with paper jams, so it took a while for me to get it out. I had to go through the back and unjam it.  Then the printer wouldn't work. I was so distressed. Even came close to calling the repair shop around the corner. But I went with the trouble shooting feature on the toolbox in the printer program. Ta da! Found the problem...I didn't turn the knob on the back of the printer back to 'lock' after opening it. When I did, the printer lights popped on and trumpets blasted.  How does one repay the Goddess of Trouble Shooting? I mediated for a few minutes and the way was shown. I sacrificed upon the alter of troubleshooting an office supply clerk.

         I watched the nephews for a few hours last night. Ben, the 2 & 1/2 yr old decided to write all over his legs and arms and face with an ink pen. I have no idea where he got the pen. He did it while I was making supper for his brother. Thank heavens it was an old cheap pen that washes off with soap. That little fellow is a mischief-maker. He thought if he hid his legs under his shirt, I wouldn't see what he did. I guess he thought the ink on his face and arms was invisible.

      Life was a maple tree and he was the nymph who lived there, a solitary man of poetic beauty. He gave birth to vibrant maple colors, within each leaf’s vein, etching visions of the world around him. From his great height, his interpretations of daily life were found layered in bark. The syrup that poured in steady streams was sweet from his poetic kiss, for the nymph loved his life on the maple.     golden leaf solo  journey down life’s river    One day, the nymph learned that the maple tree was not truly his. It belonged to a higher force, which he had no control over. His grief was unbearable, for it was all he knew—the world around him, his kingdom. What was he to do? Where to go? The atmosphere around the maple was grave, for it had questions of its own. How would it survive without his nurturing poetic heart?    on rough bark poetry and music from his soul    The nymph began his packing with sorrow in his heart. Every leaf unturned to find a verse or a tear embellished by his aura. His imprint would last for eons, yet he would never know. Destiny played her game of wheel of fortune, but his odds of luck weren’t clear.  He continued to find beauty in spite of the sadness.     in a tear~ crystal stars his poetry    One day, as he looked around for another tree call home, he saw a fairy playing in a clear patch within a dandelion field, spring rain her laughter. How could she be happy when the world and moon has collided? He watched her, blowing on the fuzzy head of a dandelion and grabbing a winged seed, laughing as it gave her a short ride. Suddenly he realized that his world wasn’t so limited. He stood by a dandelion with possessions ready, waiting for a strong zephyr to take him exciting places, outside his maple-tinted world.    waiting unborn poems spawned by hope

         I've been doing some chores this morning. Nothing fun...but then are chores supposed to be fun. lol  We're talking Mom to a cool Chinese restaurant at around 3:30-4 this afternoon. Then its back home. Tonight's the Survivor finale. Yea, some people think its lame to watch..but jeez have you seen some of the programs on TV lately?????  I wonder if the Thelma and Louise movie will ever get off the women's channels? Every time I surf, I hear that horrible southern accent that Susan S tries to pull off.  Thanks but no thanks, I'll chose Survivor anytime...and having a crush on Jeff Probst really helps. ;)  I dreamt of him about every week during the last survivor. I would be afraid to get them analyzed. hehe  Damn, got off on a tangent!   I logged on here to write a little letter about my mom, but found instead that a haibun was born. I discovered haibun while looking for info on western haiku. There was a big debate a year or so back, about the proper way to write haiku. I'll go into that another day...today it's haibun day.  Haibun is supposed to be tighly written haiku essence prose about a journey, either physical or spiritual with a haiku at the end.  Usually the haiku is related to the prose.  There isn't a Haibun police, so you aren't committed to sticking to the traditional Basho haibun.    The one I wrote is for my wonderful friend, Robert.  I've laced haiku between each small paragraph.

        I’m finding myself with a few moments of quiet time at work. Dad’s off taking wedding photos in Fayetteville. I’ve gotten out my Mother’s Day rush. Would you believe someone called and asked if I could do a photographic restoration job in less than 2 hours. My reply was rather sarcastic, though I didn’t mean to come off sounding that way. I said,  “Sure, I’ve got fairy dust.”   But when I told them the rush charge fee, they decided to go a different route with a present for dear old Mom.   ~ ~ ~* ~ ~ ~  I haven’t written anything, except haiku all week. I know I should write or quill will become rusted over. (I’m in the process of reading Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix for the 3 rd time). I’m seriously thinking of doing an erotic short story collection under a pen name. I’ve got plenty of short stories and a few not posted anywhere, too.  ~ ~ ~ * ~ ~ ~  The other day, Uncle Red asked me what would I do if I won the SC lottery. I think the pot was up to 170 million. I said the first thing that came to mind.   “I would buy myself a Caribbean Island or…maybe a third world country and proclaim myself queen.”   He wasn’t too sure what to make of my comment. I guess he was expecting the usual sort of things people around here wish for. But I don’t play the lottery and really haven’t given it much thought.  ~  ~ ~ * ~ ~ ~

        A cape of pines on the horizon made me feel covered in viridian green. &nbsp;  I drove down the road, trying to imagine the lining under the pines. Was it cotton straw or satin green? Above the pines were furry clouds, edged in ghost gray.       &nbsp;          slow drive     down a country road     picturesque visions       &nbsp;         I was in no hurry to get to where I needed to be. For a moment, I decided to take time to watch the scenery that made me feel as if I were standing still, as it rushed by. How did I manage to remember the small pleasure of a non-worried mind?       &nbsp;         days drown     in bitter rushing     of worries       &nbsp;         On a wire above a ditch sat a kingfisher. &nbsp;  His silvery blue feathered head cocked and alert. No escape for some unlucky insect, fish or frog. My grandfather once told me that kingfishers were water spirits. I nodded as I passed him, thinking how noble he looked on the wire, a king surveying his kingdom.       &nbsp;         on a wire     waiting for dinner     kingfisher       &nbsp;         Too soon my journey ended. As I walked the block to work, I felt a sprinkling of cool rain. A moment before I let the worries of a workingwoman embrace me, I smiled a thank you to the water spirit for his blessing.       &nbsp;         sweetly purifying     summer rain soothes     my tired heart

        Its hard to believe half the year is gone.  What happened to it? Did I sleep through most of the last 6 months? I was thinking about time this morning, as I drove to work and also about a cowboy song, called Dust and Stars (A Stephen Brooke Original).       &nbsp;    We worry about the little things too much. Can you remember what you were worrying about at this exact moment     a year ago? 2 yrs ago? 10? I can't either. Only those that keep details minutes of their life written down can tell us that.      &nbsp;    But why do we worry? Human nature?       Steve says that when we're gone we become "Dust and Stars."   I like that idea. I've decided I'm not worrying about the little things anymore...cuz I want to shine bright after I'm gone and not burn out before.                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;   Opal Rose  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;          "Everyone has talent. What is rare is the courage to follow that talent to the dark place where it leads."  ~&nbsp;Erica Jong               &nbsp;

          I drew you last night     in multi-colors     on a   blue   textured paper,     thin but with tooth,     so the granite would stick     to your image.      &nbsp;            Greens    over   blues  ,       golden sienna   over   brown  ,     colors upon colors     found their way onto paper.      &nbsp;        But when it came time     to draw the heart of you,     my fingers found  black .     They trembled as I touched     the paper and marred it     with your true color.      &nbsp;    ~~~~~ ~~~~~~~      &nbsp;     A note about this poem. It was to be a happy sexy sweet poem, but I overheard my father in a conversation with my Uncle Red tell him that "&lt;Name withheld&gt; will show his true colors one day." Uncle Red jokingly asked him what was the person's true color. Dad said  black .                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;   Opal Rose  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;          "Everyone has talent.

         Deafening thunder rings like hollow oaks in the garden of your eyes, as you try to embrace zephyrs that leave salty condensation on your skin.  You offer aching insight into the hasty memory of citris lips walking over seashore pebbles, but can only give small gems of the truth about the starry night you stole heaven's sparkle.  Lithe and joyful, you fake a debonair heart, while dancing alone as I weep. You stole my brilliance with your clandestine karma. Eventually storms pass, as do memories. Soon I'll forget your name.    ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~       &nbsp;     (Just a touch of Neruda and a memory of a sly old flame who had a cheating heart)                                  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;   Opal Rose  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;          "Everyone has talent.

         When he said that his loins were afire, I knew that he was not for me. The cynical woman that I am cannot abide the flimflam of old romance. I am a feral beast when it comes to lust. Do not write sonnets of love, Nor try to capture my essence in a twist-of-hair-at-my-nape haiku. Give me the heat that two consenting adults can generate, Once the niceties of society are laid to rest. I want to prowl In the humidity of lust and roar in its climax. Meowpurr.  ~Sherrie  *This poem came to me after reading poem after poem of flaming loins in another romantic poetry group. Come on people, are we in the 19th century??? Course I didn't post this there. lol                                  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;   Opal Rose  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;          "Everyone has talent.

          My friend Sam is working on a chapbook of poetry to take with him to a comic convention he goes to every year. He asked me and a few others to contribute short pieces to introduce each chapter. My short piece will be on love.      &nbsp;    Why is it that when you write for yourself, you feel okay with what you write? (at least I do) But when you're writing something for somebody else, you fear that it will be inadequate?       &nbsp;    That's how I feel about writing for his chapbook. I've written two short pieces, yet I wonder if I have captured what he's looking for. I hate doubting my work. It's something I rarely do. But for this request, I want it to be perfect.      &nbsp;   &nbsp;                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;   Opal Rose  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;          "Everyone has talent.

        Summer temptations make a man go insane,     Especially when a fruity bikini is my attire.     He should blame it on the grapes,     Their sweet globes tempted him to taste.     Juicy and succulent, he couldnt stop until all were gone.     Then came the peach slices with an aroma of sunshine.     He licked and nuzzled until there was nothing left but me.      Lucky for me, he still had an appetite.         &nbsp;

          He was a blue denim boy in a ripped t-shirt,        All blonde and burly with a crooked smiled,       Which held secrets that I aimed to expose.       We spent a summer together at the coast.       Bare feet and tanned skin, the sun loved us.       At night when the tide was high,        We grooved to the tunes of seduction,       The kind that was double-loaded with lust.       On a blanket under the pier, we sexed the sand.       I was on top, doing a belly dance move       That was illegal at the time.       With circle and a hip drop, I crowned him.       He reigned in climatic glory. Those were the days.       Looking back, I realize I never did expose        The secrets that lived in the crook of his smile.       Now, twenty years later, I look in the mirror       And see a few of my own secrets lurking in mine.

         I finally got the new one to work, after spending half the day on it.       Last night I wrote some poetry offline but forgot to bring it to work.

      I had a great yesterday! Dad, Lisa and the nephews came over. The food was delicious and it was gobbled up by Dad and Lisa. You would think she didn't know how to cook...wait, she doesn't. :P I made a delicious squash casserole, boiled new potatoes with garlic and onions, steaks on the grill and a salad.   Dad played with the nephews. He rarely goes to visit Lisa. He makes excuses but the low-down is that he's a loner, much like she is. She's so much of one that I was very surprised when she got married and then produced two children. That's one reason why I keep the boys so much--to give her some quiet time so she won't go insane.  William ended up spending the night. I think he would live 24/7 with me, if he had the choice. Lisa made a remark that he might end up living with me when he gets older. I don't mind, but part of me feels sad, because he is a sweet child. His autism isn't a problem unless one makes it so. He's like any person--he's an individual with his own way of doing things. One had to fine a way to get on his level and when you do, I swear its worth it.  Gosh, didn't mean to go off on that tanget.

      A quiet day at work. I'm killin' time until 4 pm. That song by Clint Black comes to mind when I think of killin' time, especially this line:     "I just might find I'll be killin' time for eternity."    I hope life will return to normal next week. Ben's much better today. He's a little trooper. I'm amazed at how well he dealt with having his tonsils out at so young an age. He's talking but its all muffly. When he does ring out clear, his voice is very high.   William did great this past week. He listened to me and never once failed to understand what I wanted him to do. He didn't argue about brushing his teeth or going to bed. He was happy to be with his Aunt Sherrie. We are a team.   ...And I kicked his butt playing Mario Kart 64 on the old Nintendo that my brother gave him. I gave him every opportunity to win but he wasn't interested in that goal. He kept falling into rivers or down canyons or riding off the explore the castle when we rode past it. I dreamt about the stupid game almost every night this week.  Tomorrow is Father's Day. I'm having Dad over for an early dinner. We're grilling out. Lisa and the boys are coming over. I'm happy to hear that my lugheaded brother-in-law has to work. He's the biggest idiot this side of the SC line.  I haven't been online much after work this week. Surprisingly I haven't missed it. After William would go to bed, I did some reading--A short story collection by Bentley Little. Very good horror author.   And I did some Tarot studies too. Tomorrow morning I'll tackle some readings.  I've missed chatting with a few people. Sara came on a while ago and we caught up on our news. I haven't had time to chat with her all week. I also miss chatting with Robert. We enjoy a good laugh and the discussion of writing poetry and musing over muses.  We finally got the AC fixed at the studio. The unit is so old that it took 3 techs to work on it...but they ended up calling a guy who's been working on AC units since the beginning of the AC age. He said he was surprised the unit still works. Me, well, I'm happy it still does.  The family store next-door to us, The Washington's have a death in the family. Joan the mom's father passed away this week. He was 84. Today is the funeral. They left the studio number as the emergency number. Some chick just called and asked if I had a 'suit' for her. It seems she ordered a suit for father's day and didn't pick it up when they called her yesterday. I told her no and she was all upset over it. Jeez...is this an emergency??? I don't think so. She was suppose to pick the suit up on Thurs and knew that they were closed today. I'm not worrying about it. A person should use their noggin.  I finally caught up on the commissioned oils I've been working on since March. I had 3. Two have been viewed and will be picked up next week. The other is still sitting on my easel in the paint room, covered with a drop cloth. The lady who commissioned me is out of town for a few weeks. She's an accountant and is on Bald Head Island, NC vacationing.  I'll probably have a brief lull until Sept. Which is fine, cuz my hand's been achy.  The weather is electrical at night. I can tell when a storm is coming by the steady throb of pain in my right hand across the knuckles and at the wrist. Maybe I should see doctor # 5 about it. Something to ponder over.  Wow, I've killed some time. Better publish this, check my email one last time and then get my few chores done.  :) I've rambled enough.

       I wrote this poem for a good friend.     A Poet's Quest  On linen paper inked in blue Is the wistful tale of a quest. The long search for vintage beauty And eternal hope of love, Written under the clock of night By a wounded saddened poet.  Tell us your tale, moonstone poet Of how you search the sky soft blue And waltz across the dim of night Never abandoning your quest Of finding an enchanted love Encased in porcelain beauty.  How elusive is this beauty That drives you to write, blue poet? In every face you look for love That might be dressed in denim blue. And pray to end your solemn quest That consumes the heart of your night.  Yet in the midnight of black night You create works of such beauty. Others fall in love with your quest Devouring your words, poet. You redefine the color blue And give new song to the word love  Is it a crime to yearn for love? It oils the suit of a white knight And powers your pen of ink blue. To read you is to touch beauty, An amazing gift to have, poet. On a word steed, you pen your quest.  Others seek the very same quest. They long to find their soul's one love. Few have the heart of you, poet Who writes away the grim of night And finds in pain its dark beauty. Your heart writes poetry in blue.  Carry on, poet, your heart's quest To search the blue for treasured love And verse lonesome night with beauty.

      I wrote Al last week with the news of my poetry book. I didn't want others to tell him first. I tried to be very impersonal in the letter. He called Monday night. We chatted as friends and I thought, "Great, he's finally realizing we can't go back." We hung up on good terms.  Then he called an hour later. He had written the first part of a poem and asked me to finish it. He said, "It's only right that you finish it. The poem's about you."  I finished it a while ago, printed it and am mailing it back to him.  He wrote the first stanza. I wrote the last. Here it is below:   Dew Suckle Honey  She came to me upon flowered breath Dew suckle honey, oh how I wept. To come so far and leave me behind, for a moment I flowered Now she's left me behind. Dew suckle honey, the flowers' breath I searched her in longing But there can be no rest.  Dew suckle honey, bumble bees sing. She came to him at the first of spring. Daisies sighed and violets wept, On heaven’s cloud they were swept. Dew suckle honey, along came fall As mold grew on the garden wall. He was rooted; she had to fly away. Dew suckle honey, memories stay.

      I'm back. Ben's surgery was a success. He's home and doing as well as can be expected. I've got to go get William from preschool at 3ish. Lisa wants me to take him to her house until I or mom gets off.   I didn't go with Lisa to the hospital yesterday. Instead I kept William and we had a 'fun' day. We played with the Nintendo 64. I rule at Mario Kart. He likes to leave the track and go exploring. So I win every time. hehe He's staying at my house tonight. I promised him a re-match.

      I'm working hard today because I may have to go with my sister to take little Ben the hospital. His tonsils come out tomorrow. I was amazed when she said it was now out-patient surgery. He'll have to be careful for 2 weeks due to bleeding but other than that he should be fine.   Lisa told him yesterday that he has Aunt Sherrie's blue eyes and her bad tonsils. Yea, I do have bad tonsils--in fact my throat is raw now from my sinuses draining. Allergies suck!  I hate to see Ben go through surgery. William had his removed at 3 and he had the worse time. I think it was partly due to his autism. Lisa said that when Ben had his finger pricked for blood work on Friday that he didn't bat an eye. So maybe, he'll do better. I hope so.   I've got a freezer full of ice cream and a ton of jello waiting for him.

       Spider Solitaire   I play it on the home PC. As soon as I log onto my portion of the computer (I've created user names for me, my brother John and The boys) I click on the shortcut I created for Spider Solitaire. Do I make it online? Well, not all the time.   Several nights this week, I've made a vow that I was going to do some short story writing and shamefully, I never did.  Once you play Spider Solitaire, there's no going back to the boring regular variety.  I'll play until I lose a hand. The problem is...I've gotten so good I can play for hours and not lose one game.   Last night, I logged onto William's site and got online long enough to send some email, printed out part of a poem I had in an email draft and checked my RB group. But as I was about to log off, I found myself clicking on programs and on the verge of opening Spider Solitaire.  Guess what happened? Thunder shouted at me and I saw lightning flicker (I had all the lights out except the PC screen). I decided to take this as a sign from the Higher Power to not click on the link and to get my cute ass to bed.

      (Someone asked me to write a 'love' poem. So with the wine of my words, I produced cheese and crackers. May they sate for now. lol)    Twilight and You  With the dimming light of day failing, The air takes on a distorted look, Like a slightly out of focus photo. Trees blend into shadows,  While sparrows chase night bugs, Awakened by the setting sun.  It is twilight’s first peep At the remains of the day.  Soon the moon will rise above the trees. The world around me will fall into shadows, Clothing me in deep purple shades of you. You and twilight, my lovers at night. Dance with me, as fireflies light the evening With winking sparkles that keep secrets.  Your hands mold my twilight Into seductive moonlight.  I cry that I love you, my twilight warrior. You are the one who caged my heart, enslaved my soul. My body so bathes in desire for you, A harlot of lust and lips of wine. It is twilight and you impale me  With the first taste of night’s pleasure.  Shadows meld with us, as we join. I am lost in twilight and you.

      I talked to Sam on Sunday for a little while. He owns the first yahoo group that I wrote poetry in. Last May he made me a co-moderator, something I consider to be a high honor. Anyway, he was really excited and happy on Sunday because the creator of The Crow, James O'Barr joined Poetry in Blue.  On the homepage of the group is one of his drawings and its is awesome. He seems like a really nice guy, too.  Here's his website:  urlLink The Crowfan club

         The sea ebbs within my thoughts tonight, churning white caps of foam, salty and rich. The death of May surfs in under a winking moon's glow. With the death is a memory of sea birds flying; pelicans, terns, seagulls and herons gliding on air. Feathers on the same bird, he and I never were. Though we loved the sea and the dangerous beauty she bred. It is the end of May and the sea calls me, urging me to bathe in her deep waters, to sit on a rock, combing my hair with broken shells, sing a mournful melody and lure ships to the rocks. I am fearful of the sea; afraid that I will be the one lured by her mournful songs to crash amongst the jagged rocks and perish inside a memory.      ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~      I wrote this poem May 29. The inspiration behind it is a mixture of memories. I'm amazed at some of the replies it got in the Yahell Y-groups. This is one of the few poems that has a story behind it. I thought I would share it, since it's been on my mind last week.  My ex-fiance, Charles's birthday was May 29, which usually coincides with Memorial Day weekend. We were together from Feb. 1989 until Jan. 1995. The reasons why we didn't work out really don't matter now. In fact, I rarely think of him, except on Memorial Day weekend. Surprisingly hardly any of my poems are about him. I moved on years ago. He is a liar, a cheater and a mamma's boy. This year he's 43.  The last 3 or so years that we were together, he lived at Carolina Beach, NC in an oceanfront condo. It had a very nice 2nd floor view to the beach. About three condo's down was the pavilion, which had shops, I spent many early afternoon's windowshopping as I ate ice cream that dripped over my fingers.   The beach was always so beautiful, even during a storm. I drove almost 2 hours to see him every weekend. On Sunday mornings, I would wake up early, grab a blanket and a cup of coffee to watch the sun rise. What a sight! The sky would be a pale butter color, then a peach color, a bright white and finally a pale blue. Each color would reflect on the ocean's surface, sparkling like jewels. The shrimp boats would be out with their nets in the water, and dolphins would swim behind them, as birds flocked overhead. Sometimes I would see people walking or jogging along the strand. I found peace of mind as I watched these sights alone, while Charles snored away.   From late spring until late fall, I would go out to the ocean at around 8, after the sun was up in the sky warming the air. In a lounge chaise, I would read or have my binoculars out, watching the ocean for signs of dolphin, whales or sharks. Yes, I saw each on several occasions. Or I would have my 'bird' book out, reading about the sea fowl that stuck together in flocks, taunting the tourist. Charles usually swam or played volley ball with some of the other locals who lived in his condo. I usually stayed out on the beach until noon. I would gather my things up, go inside and take a nap or make lunch, sometimes sit on the balcony and watch the antics on the beach or go get ice cream at the pavilion. Then at around 3, I would go back out to the ocean and stay on the beach until 8 pm. I loved the area and for a while believed I would one day live there.  But life doesn't go as planned.   When I think of my years with Charles, the beach comes to mind. We both loved it so dearly. I painted tons of oceanic scenes--dolphin, lighthouses, crashing surfs... He had all of them until he gave them to his mother because of a girlfriend who was jealous of his mementos of me.  That's where the poem came from...the lingering memories of the sea and Charles.

        ...okay...I shouldn't make fun of his name. I'm in a playful mood, so excuse me.    When I got online this morning, I had a ton of offlines from John (an old online friend who got me interested in reading the Harry Potter books). He took his son to see the movie this weekend and Sara (another online friend) told him I had went to see it, too.  Since there are probably people reading here that haven't seen the movie yet, I won't say anything that hasn't been said already. I'll just say this...     J and I agree that though it was a good movie, we are having a hard time not faulting it for what was left out.      Yes, it is a big story to tell in under 3 hours, but still...there were important little tidbits that make the story that were left out.   It is very hard to separate the book from the movie, when you so love the book. John said that maybe we should stop reading the books. But that would be a tragedy, I think. J. K. Rowlings writes an incredible tale. The movies try to capture it, and they do in big ways, but like I told J, it's hard to make a movie that is in tune with our imagination.

       Why is it that when you have a Monday off the rest of the week seems to be longer? I'm tired today. Battling a slow Saturday at work isn't helping any. I'm out of paper, so I can't do my printing. I don't know how I mistook an empty open box for a full one. I'll blame it on the fingerprint smug on my glasses.  Well, tonight is the night...the new Harry Potter movie is out. I'm there, baby.  We had electrical storms yesterday afternoon and last night. The oak tree in the backyard lost a few of its arms. When we have electrical storms, my right hand really bothers me. Today its very stiff, I keep making typing errors. I've caught most of them. hehe I should have worn my brace but I hate it.   I have some Tarot reading requests for the weekend. Since I'm tired today, I'll wait until tomorrow to do them.  Can't believe it's taken me 30 mins to scribble here. Time to head home. I'll be back soon.  :D

       ...just busy.   I had a great weekend of being lazy. It was wonderful. But naturally, coming back to work after a few days off I find I'm scrambling around to get my work out for the week. One day off makes a big difference. Its amazing.  Mom's fiance is home from rehab. She's been there during her spare time. I didn't realize how much she helps out at my house.  I haven't the boys much lately and I miss them so much. Lisa called today and asked if William can spend the night--that he's been asking for me. I said yes. A night of being silly is what I need.  The poetry book's off to the publisher. Now I'm concentrating on editing my novel and working up exercises for my creative writing group. It's been stagnant for a while. Bless my co-moderator--he's been too busy to help and I've been to busy to work in it, too. But now, I'm free and feel the urge to write.  I've been reading Stephen King's book--On Writing. Its greatness.  Oops... clients here. Back to work!

       My sister Lisa's birthday is tomorrow. She'll be the big 4-0! Mom's making homemade ice cream and cooking some sort of food on the grill. Not sure what yet. Then Sunday, I'm having Dad, Lisa and the boys over for dinner. Dad's birthday is Aug 2.    &nbsp;   It's hard to believe time has flown so fast. Soon this year will be over and 2005 will be here. I feel as if I'm living day to day, not really thinking of it as time flies by and weeks leave not even a dust trail behind them.   &nbsp;   Every day I think I'll work on this or that, paint or draw, write or edit...but I don't get a chance to do either some days. The simple joys I get are through writing and art, but time restraints keep me from them. I have books I want to read that are sitting on my bookcase shelf, each summoning me as I walk by them daily.    &nbsp;   But I do know one thing--I take time to enjoy my nephews every chance I can. I know when they get older they won't wanna hang out with old Aunt Sherrie.&nbsp; At least I have that comfort, even if I don't get to other things.   &nbsp;   My ISP has been flaky lately at work. I don't know why. I've done everything I can to help the PC along. Its a dinasaur. Much as Dad doesn't want to invest in another system, we'll have too by the end of the year.   &nbsp;   Work's been steady for us so far. We usually slow down to a crawl during the summer. I've had some interesting projects to work on. I'm working on some Navy photos from WWII right now. Cracked and creased--but not for long. After they're done, I've got a few photos from the early 70's to fix. They've turned a funny red color.    &nbsp;   Tomorrow I'll be at work by myself. Maybe I'll be able to get some poems finished. It's usually quiet on Saturdays that Dad has a wedding.   &nbsp;   Well, back to work. :(                                   my website   &nbsp;               &nbsp;

       I watched a crazy teen movie last night--EuroTrip.   &nbsp;   Sex, teens and craziness along with thin plots and holes in the story. But hey, it was fun to watch.    &nbsp;   There was one crazy scene where a mime doing a robot imitation fought with the 'lead' guy who was also doing a robot imitation. I swear that was the craziest thing I've seen in ages. Two robots fighting in robot mode. I laughed so freaking hard. I can see it in my head now. And I'm laughing.   &nbsp;   And the song "Scotty doesn't know" keeps playing in my head.   &nbsp;   Its a fun movie, full of laughs and ya know, sometimes you need some silliness to counter all the seriousness of daily life.   &nbsp;

                             Scorpio Sun Sign Profile  October 23 - November 21                      Scorpio is the eighth Sign of the Zodiac, and you shouldn't take that lightly. You shouldn't take Scorpios lightly, either. Those born under this Sign are dead serious in their mission to learn about others. There's no fluff or chatter for Scorpios, either: these folks will zero in on the essential questions, gleaning the secrets that lie within. Scorpios concern themselves with beginnings and endings, and are unafraid of either; they also travel in a world which is black and white and has little use for gray. The curiosity of Scorpios is immeasurable, which may be why they are such adept investigators. These folks love to probe and know how to get to the bottom of things. The fact that they have a keen sense of intuition certainly helps.   It's the Scorpion which symbolizes Scorpios, and it's no accident. Much like the Scorpion would rather kill itself than be killed, those born under this Sign are the ones who are in ultimate control of their destiny. It is life on the Scorpion's terms, too, since these folks promote their agenda (they are quite the executives) and see to it that things go forward. Others may find this overbearing (it can be) and even self-destructive, but that's the beauty of the Scorpion: these folks have tremendous regenerative powers, much like the literal Scorpion can lose its tail and promptly grow a new one. Fearless Scorpions rarely lose, per se, they just keep on going, since they are stubborn and determined to succeed (this Scorpio trait is in keeping with the Fixed Quality assigned to this Sign). Scorpios work as hard as they do so they can someday sit back and feel satisfied with themselves. These folks are intense, passionate and filled with desire. They're also complex and secretive,  so don't expect to get much out of them, lest they become suspicious and exit stage left. It's best not to bet against Scorpios, either, since these folks are surprisingly resourceful.                              Scorpio is ruled by the Planets Mars and Pluto. Mars was the God of War in ancient Roman mythology and is the first (and most ancient) ruler of Scorpio. When Pluto was discovered in the 20th century, it was also assigned to this Sign. Pluto was known as the God of the Underworld in ancient Roman times, so when coupled with Mars, expect some intense energy to head toward Scorpions here on Earth. This planetary combo makes for people who are motivated, penetrating and aware. Scorpions don't miss much, since they are highly attuned to the vibrations of others. They are intuitive, probing and very focused on knowing who's who and what's what. Scorpions can lose their temper (and even become vengeful) when someone gets in their way, so it's best to give them plenty of room. Remember, they're unafraid, and a loss today simply means an opportunity for victory tomorrow.   The Element associated with Scorpio is Water. As opposed to the 'roiling seas' seen in other Water Signs, a better motto for Scorpions would be 'still waters run deep.' Those born under this Sign are as emotional as their waterborne brethren, it's just that they're not as likely to show it. The Scorpio's emotions are repressed, kept under cover. Again, secrets to be used another day. That said, be aware that these folks are clever, perceptive and always in the mix. Their ability to see into things can sometimes be a curse for Scorpions, however, since they can take an insignificant matter and turn it into a huge slight. Beware the Scorpion who feels crossed! These folks can turn vindictive in no time flat. Luckily, once Scorpions catch their breath, they will return to their usual determined and loyal (albeit strong-willed) ways. Finally, while Scorpions aren't above some subtle manipulation to get what they want, they'd much rather take a scientific, even mystical path. The  Scorpio-born are powerful and passionate, qualities which serve them well, as long as they don't let them deteriorate into self-indulgence or compulsion.                          Scorpios love competition in both work and play, which is why they'll air it out in sports and games. Extreme sports are right up the Scorpion's alley, as is most anything which will test their mettle. They've got to have an adversary, since it makes the game that much more fun. The Scorpion's colors? Powerful red and serious black. When it comes to love, though, Scorpions soften up a bit and are caring and devoted with their lovers, even if they do hold on a bit tight. Scorpions are also lusty in the extreme (how else?), so they need to be mindful of their reproductive organs.   The great strength of the Scorpio-born is in their determination, passion and motivation. Scorpions don't know the word quit, which is why they usually get the job done. A powerhouse? Like no other.                                                my website   &nbsp;               &nbsp;

       I realized why I love poetry styles challenges--because when I master a poetry form, I feel that I am a true poet. The same goes with writing exercises.&nbsp; I get bored easily and find that a challenge awakens my muse.&nbsp; I was talking with Robert about this. He said that when he needs a challenge he thinks of a new subject to write a poem about. Ah... it is so nice to see the individuality of creative minds at work.&nbsp; I wonder what other poets do to inflame the desire of their muse. Hmmm a good question to post in the ygroups.     &nbsp;   Now, yesterday day I found a new style--The Ethere poetry form. Below is a Double Standard Ethere that I wrote last night after thinking about an IM I received this weekend from an 'inflamed' would be cyber suitor who peeped into my photo album on my fairy profile and decided to write a haiku about my  blue  eyes. I ignored him...I'm sure he eventually found success with another cybersex fiend.     &nbsp;   The poem is called   "The Blues of My Eyes."     &nbsp;   Winds    drifting    moving clouds    across the sky.    The  blues  of my eyes~    you say Heaven reigns there    in pale gold lights that sparkle,    revealing a smile that lingers.    You long to claim the smile in my eyes,    attempting to seduce me with sonnets.    Silly man, I write my own poetry,    fine-tuning verse with the heart of me    mastering words with discipline.    My eyes do not hold heaven    nor does gold sparkle there.    I claim no beauty,    but in my words.    The real me    is in    them.

         Will this work day&nbsp;ever end? I feel as if I've been here&nbsp;for 10 hours.   &nbsp;   Well, Lisa (my sister) and I watched the Secret Window last night.   A good flick... actually better than the short story Secret Window, Secret Garden    by Stephen King. Its in his Four Past Midnight collection.   &nbsp;   If you've read the short story... don't expect the book to follow it faithfully.   I wonder if King realizes that when the movie is so extremely different from the story   that the meaning of the story is gone.&nbsp; Especially with Secret Window. I won't go into detail but I will say this... the ending is not a part of the story in the Four Past Midnight book...not even close to the ending of the story. Hell its in f%cking left field somewhere.   &nbsp;   Going to dinner tonight with a good friend. Don't know where yet, but I hope its a yummy-licous place. I'm hungry.    &nbsp;   Someone lent me their Cold Mountain DVD, so I'll check it out sometime this weekend. No major plans except to paint my bookcase and put another one together. After the stress of this week, I plan to relax.                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;   Opal Rose  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;          "Everyone has talent.

          Days of wine and roses were swept away in moonlight.     Every scent of our passion sailed on the night breeze,     until the air was alive with the smell of love and us.     My Moonstone man, strong but fragile, you loved night,     the dark skies lived in your eyes.     I was made of sunlight, you once said smiling.     You pampered me with riches&nbsp;from the&nbsp;earth.     Wine stained my lips and rose petals danced in my tresses.     With spun sun gold fingers, I traced your lips,     memorizing their folds, their creases and the smile hiding there.     Days of wine and roses can't last forever, so we were told.     But we lived them longer than the Gods ever dreamed     and even as night claimed us, we burned a constellation     that the heavens can't ignore.                                  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;   Opal Rose  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;          "Everyone has talent.

       Martha, one of the 'bakery' ladies had a tragedy to occur early Sat morning at around 1 am. Her son Robert was killed at his convienent store during a robbery. I knew him very well. He was only 27. Martha doesn't work at the bakery much anymore due to having to take care of her husband, Jerry who had a stroke last summer. He's improving daily.   &nbsp;   Robert was married to Rhonda, a girl who doesn't know a stranger and has the clearest lightest blue eyes I've ever seen. I saw her the night I went to see Spiderman. She was at the theatre with a young girl she calls her 'adoptive' daughter. She talked about the store and all the plans they had. They began leasing it about 3 or 4 months ago. She told me to drop by and said that my dad did daily. Its on the road going to his house.    &nbsp;   One thing about the store is that its off&nbsp;the dark exit # 19&nbsp;of I-95. Right beside it, is a big vast wooded area that runs close to the Lumber River. There used to be a 'beach' close to it--McMillian Beach, a very small pond/lake off the river with clear water, back in the 40-60's it was a local hangout complete with a bath house. But the lady who owned it died years ago and now, its an abandoned area thick with overgrowth--a place where drug users hang out. (My Granny Leggett who died in 1995 once got lost there--but that's another story).   &nbsp;   I am very distressed over Robert's death. He was a quiet guy, a hard worker. When he would come over to the bakery, he was always friendly and smiling. Martha and Jerry dote on him, because he is such a good boy. Or was. Gail who owns the bakery and I have talked about this for the last few days. She is distressed and I am comforting.&nbsp;    &nbsp;   The police called Rhonda this morning and told her that they were through processing the store and that she can go clean up the blood and reopen if she wants too.&nbsp; Very compassionate, eh? I told Gail if they need me to help clean up, I will do it. And no, I don't want to but that's what friends do--they are there for you, even when its hard on them.   &nbsp;   Below is a copy of the article that was in yesterday's paper about the robbery.   &nbsp;       Store owner shot 4 times     By Mark Locklear -Staff writer       LUMBERTON - The owner of a convenience store who was murdered Saturday was shot four times although a videotape does not show him resisting two men who were robbing his business, according to police.       Police say they expect to release still photographs of the two men soon. A security camera recorded the murder of Robert Woodell, 27, who owned Ali's Discount Cigarette Store at 2011 Carthage Road.       Police have not been able to identify the men, but Lt. Mickey Biggs said, "We're looking into some information we received," Biggs said.       The videotape shows two men entering the store shortly after 1 a.m. One of the men shoots Woodell four times, three times in the torso and once in the head. The men then stole money from the cash register and ran from the store.       "He didn't appear to be resisting," Biggs said of Woodell.       Lumberton police Officer Jerry Kinlaw, who was patrolling the area and heard the store's alarm sounded, found Woodell.       Biggs wouldn't say how much money was taken, but did say no one else was in the store at the time of the robbery. The tape has been turned over to the State Bureau of Investigation.       "We are trying to enhance the video and get some prints. The reason why it is taking so long is there aren't too many places around that make copies from video," Biggs said.       According to Biggs, both men were black. One of the men was dressed in a white cap, long white shirt, dark pants and white sneakers. The other man was dressed in a dark baseball cap, a light shirt, dark pants and dark shoes.       Biggs said he couldn't comment on the ages of the robbers.       Woodell and his wife recently took over management of the store, also known as the Texaco Food Mart. It remained closed this morning with yellow crime scene tape encircling the parking lot.       Woodell lived at 411 Old Whiteville Road.

      We've had storms here since Saturday. Yesterday was the worst. The lightning was so bad I was afraid to stand close to a window.   Naturally, my ISP has been flaky due to the rain. Today so far it's been okay but I've been too busy with work to post or reply in all the Ygroups.     I'm in a prose mood. And have been working offline of my novel. I want it to be the best it can be and won't settle til I'm 97% happy. (yea I'll never be 100%.. and 3% of negative thinking isn't bad)   Let's see.. what's been going on! Work's been busy. I've got a few orders due out this week. Dad's been photographing beauty queens. I swear their moms are gonna  poison me with hair spray. My desk isn't far from the makeup table. I have a fan going and its not so bad until they go into the camera room. Between poses the mom sprays the hair and it rides the air current to my desk. No amount of sneezing and coughing can get them to put down that can. Where are the hairspray police when you need them? Hell, half these girls don't need all that makeup or goop on their faces.    JS(a guy whose been in my poetry groups forever) was on vacation and drove through Lumberton on his way north and also back home to Florida. He sent me an IM a while ago saying he thought of me when he drove through L'ton. I had to laugh because if you blink, you'll miss the town. We've been discussing the Harry Potter movie and I'm working on a draft of our combined thoughts and will post it once the debate is over.   I'm considering a mini vacation in August...Myrtle Beach sounds good. If the Outer Banks were closer I would go there. I love that area.  When I lived in Greenville, we used to drive up that way often.  I remember how in the 80's it wasn't very commercialized. The last time I was up that way was in 99 or 2001. It had changed so much. But the wild horses were still there around Duck and that's all that matters.   Well I've goofed off enough. Time to get home and see the Nephews. I think William is hanging with me tonight. We've got a Mario Kart race to run.

      I was thinking about the past last night and how aspects of it seem to slip into the present. What's up with that? Why can't the past stay away and not taint the present?   I'm not saying my past is tainting my present--well, no more than what the average person taint. But there are times when aspects of my past seem to flicker in my present, like the flutter of eyelashes when I blink.  A conversation with my friend Sara yesterday made me think of walls and how I've watched them as they are built and feeling helpless as to stop them.  The thought stuck with me all evening and before bed I logged on to write the poem below. I call it Stone By Stone   I remember this spring, green and sparkly like sun on water. The petals of dogwood trees floating on air like whispers. Rain fell in soft sprinkles, kissing the new grass into growth. You held my hand and we danced beneath a smiling moon.  Our passion ignited the skies and we wept with the intensity. I think that we made spring arrive early with our love, green, lush and so beautiful—almost painful to look at. Winter would have embraced me all summer, if not for you.  Then as quickly as a summer thunderstorm, you pulled away, my delicate hand gloveless without yours. Was it the exotic intensity that you couldn't handle? Or my passion that burned your soul with a kiss?  There are no answers as to why you built the wall. In disbelief I watched you place each stone, wondering if it was heaven crying or me. No mason could have done a more perfect job.  In silence I waited for the wall to disappear, hoping that you would see how it marred our view of each other, of our love…of our heaven. All you could see was your own sad view of yourself.  Part of me now looks at the wall and hates it, wanting to bulldoze it to the ground in flames. But my heart knows that you should remove it, examining each stone and why you placed it there…  in the first place.

          We had some big Thunderstorms Friday afternoon. I got off a little early since I had plans for the evening. Barely made it home before they hit. Luckily, they were fast and furious.       &nbsp;    Went to the theatre. Spiderman was a good movie. The previews of other movies lasted forever. My migraine was lurking in the background like a nagging thought. You know that split second of silence, right after the previews end and the first image of Columbia pictures pops on the screen? Well I filled it was a sigh so big, people actually laughed. It was a sigh that I had no control over and to be&nbsp;honest, almost didn't realize I had made.      &nbsp;    By the time the movie was over, my migraine was on threshold 2. Low but building steam. I think holding back tears didn't help. I was with a few friends who find tears at movies a weakness. And I wasn't physically able to fence with them later about why I 'girled' on them. Some people are idiots for life.      &nbsp;    Sat at work was very slow. I worked on some projects for Monday and left around 4. When I got home, Granny was driving off. She had brought me 25 lbs of freshly caught and deheaded shrimp--right off the shrimp boats on the dock at Holden Beach. She and Jewel (Her husband) know a Shrimp Captain who gave them a deal on shrimp. She mentioned a week ago that she would bring me some. But I didn't expect 25 lbs. They are nice shrimp...large enough to make Kabobs with. (I'm having some for dinner). It took me 2 hours to put the shrimp in quart sized freezer bags.&nbsp;I had my sister to drop you and pick some up after I had cleaned them. (She has no idea on how to clean shrimp).&nbsp;       &nbsp;    I boiled some for supper and they were yummy-delicious. My brother and I are having steaks and shrimp for a late lunch-early dinner.       &nbsp;    My migraine seems to be gone now. I really think it was allergy related. But I'll take an advil in a while just to be safe. I have some stronger stuff but it makes me into a zombie.      &nbsp;    Not much planned for today. I've got the Butterfly Effect to watch. And a really good murder-mystery story to solve. It's one of those books that I haven't figured out yet. I hate it when I know the plot by the 3rd chapter.      &nbsp;    Well, I'm off to do some Tarot readings while my mind is clear.

      I've been working on a post about my thoughts of the new HP3 movie. But with my achy head (yes, its starting to ache today), I've been taking my time on it.  A note to self: Don't paste from MicroWord to this blog.. it doesn't always come out right.  Yes, my Queen of Cups blog is gone. I have a private Ygroup for my Tarot journaling. It has only me in it and that's all. If I decide to go on a Tarot rant, I can do it here.  I've got to find time to update my website. Pagebuilder runs better on the home PC. I worked on the home page a few weeks ago. Some of the links need changing and also, I need to update the featured poets's page.  Let's see if I know any gossip... hmm... nope...though I heard the guy I had a crush on during my first year of college is single...hmmm... should I? Naw... I've changed too much and really, I've found out that sometimes fanasty is better than reality.

      I had one yesterday. I thought it was the beginning of a sinus infection--who knows, maybe it is.  It started slowly...the headache. Then built up to a blinding pain. I was chatting with Robert and suddenly I couldn't see the monitor clearly. So I gracefully said my goodbyes, logged offline, saved the project I had just finished and went home.  Mom and William were there. I told her I had a blinding headache. She asked if Dad was smoking in the studio. I told her yes.. he was and had been for a while. Cigarette after cigarette. She gave me the lecture that he deserved, but hey, its his life.   I tried to play with William for a while but the more I moved the more my head felt as if it were going to explode. I went to bed at 7 pm and slept until 8:15 this morning. I woke up clear as a bell, though tired. Probably from so much sleep.  My sinuses are draining and I've got a nasal drip but so far the headache's gone...though my forehead is sore to touch. I hope its gone--the headache.  But it did inspire this poem:    Life can be a migraine, twisting my heart, mind and soul in a vise. Squeezing until I feel as if death would be heaven. I can’t think. I can’t feel. I can barely breathe, until you remind me that with a kiss that there is fresh air and raspberry tea and other wonderful things. I wonder sometimes how life would be without you. With every crushing blow I receive, you heal me with a touch. In every heartache I feel, you find a song that inspires doves. When I am down so low, you lift me up so high that I can touch fireworks and feel the burning of red—the cooling of blue. I can’t imagine how black my life would be without your light. You give me the belief that I can live in castles in the sky.  ~ ~ ~    The fireworks line came from William--when he wanted me to lift him up to touch the explosion in the sky.  I'm finding that my poems are really for anyone or to anyone--they are pieces of my life around me. I touch things and a line for a poem or story flashes through my head. I've try to quickly jot them down, so they don't get lost in the rush of life.  Am I truly a poet/writer now?

       ...has been busy!   And I think I'm getting a sinus infection! Not good.  The BBQ was fun. Tiring but fun. We worked in the yard before the BBQ and it's looking nice. To Ben's disappointment we saw no frogs.  I got a new (really used but its new to him) Nintendo 64 game for William...Pokemon Snap. You ride in machines and snap pictures of the Pokemon creatures. Some are tricky... because you have to pound them with a pester ball or food or sometimes play a flute and wake them up. When we started playing it Monday, we only got through the first two courses. William didn't spend last night...so... I invested my energy and time into going through the courses and saving each one. I made it all the way to the last course. There are 63 pokemon creatures. I've found 59. I know where the others are but getting to them is trippy.  But I'm not worried about it...I'll get them eventually. At least William can go where he wants to now.  (ha ha... okay I admit it. I love the game too.)

        It's another sunny day in North Carolina,     No rain coming down.     All I can think about is the chill of winter's     Escape from this town.       &nbsp;          I want to escape too.       &nbsp;         Another humid heart worn on my sleeve,     The death of our spring.     I grow weary of a summer that's just started,     Memories that cling.       &nbsp;         I want to forget you.       &nbsp;         Somehow I will or live a painless death,     No heaven around.     It's another sunny day in North Carolina.      My soul makes no sound.         &nbsp;     ~ ~ ~ ~  An ode to the heat! It's 98 degrees today...no idea how high the heat index is.

        Since my neighbors are spending the evening firing off rockets red glare and I can't relax enough to doze off (yes I'm aware its early--William's here tonight and he keeps waking up, calling for me.)      &nbsp;    Tomorrow, its grilling day--my cousin from Gawja is up with his family. So we're having a big BBQ late afternoon. Fun fun fun...    &nbsp;    Right at Dusk, my uncle set off some fireworks. He lives across the street--three houses over. William and I stood in the front yard and watched them. Then the neighbors behind me, set some off...so we ran back there, watched for a few mins..then my uncle would set some off...we would run back to the front of the house. He held my hand, so I wouldn't get lost. He wanted me to lift him up so he could touch the lights. I'm smiling now thinking of how confident he is--that I can lift him that high.       &nbsp;    Ah... rain... that should put an end to the fireworks for now. Since its thundering, I'll head to bed. He'll have me up early tomorrow.

       ...full of relatives dropping by.    &nbsp;   I've been busy the last day or so, trying to get ahead so I can take Monday off and BBQ with the family.   &nbsp;   But I don't wanna! I've got some new poetry books that I want to read--The Best of Rumi, 9 Horses by Billy Collins, Mermaids Explained by Christopher Reid (UK poet) and a book about articles, essays and poetry by Charles Simic.&nbsp; Plus I've gotten in a few new DVD's.    &nbsp;   I wonder if I could hide in&nbsp;my room and no one find me. Nawww...wouldn't work--the nephews seem to know my hiding places.   &nbsp;   I guess I'm stuck with the BBQ, but at least I have Sat eve and Sunday to read.    &nbsp;   We've got spotty weather again. It was sprinkly this morning. My hand is achy today. I haven't had this much trouble with it in a few years. Maybe I should go to a new doctor regarding it...someone mentioned acupunture. I'll have to do a search online to see how effective it is with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

              My friend Sara and I were chatting this morning before I came to work. I was having my coffee and entering sweepstakes, which I usually do most mornings before work. She had been swimming the night before and we discussed it. I mentioned a fear of water and she asked if I knew why or if it was a deep rooted fear that needed exploring. I said that I almost drowned when I was 12. &nbsp;  As I thought about it, I realized it would make a good journal post. &nbsp;                  &nbsp;               The incident was all off 15 or 20 mins, but the repercussions lasted for years. I couldnt put my head under water, not even in the shower until I was 24. &nbsp;  Charles, my ex-fiance would do his best to get me to dunk myself in the shallow area of the pool that we had at the apartment I lived at when I was 26. I finally did to please him. It took all my courage though and I was shaking when I got out of the water, something I hid from himpretending to be cold instead of confessing what it cost me.               &nbsp;               I do not know how to swim. I should learn, but part of the fear still lives on.               &nbsp;               In a reply to a story Steve posted in one of my poetry groups back in 2002, called Surf. I wrote a brief reply, describing the near drowning. I didnt go into many details. &nbsp;  I went through the archives of the group and found my reply. Im adding to it. But the essence is here.               &nbsp;               When I was twelve I almost drowned. It was Junea month after my beloved stepfather died, sometime after school closed for the summer. My Step-Aunt Janice and her family invited my siblings and me to come to the beach with them. She had two boys who were our ages, Wayne 11 &amp; William 9. William and John my brother were best friends. Wayne was one of those guys who liked to hang out with girls (He came out of the closet in the early 90s). One of our older stepsisters, Libby came along with us. She was a grownup but very immature, so we got along great with her. &nbsp;  Mom didnt come with us. She had to deal with the  farming.               &nbsp;               The motel was at Long Beach NC, right across from the pier with a game room. In fact, Rick Flair the wrestler was there that week, hanging out at the pier and drinking beer in the parking lot. Libby flirted with him but he had eyes for some barely legal blondes and ignored her. I wasnt impressed with him. He was as loud in real life as he was on TV. This was during his beginning years. When I see him on the Wrestling shows, I think of my drowning. He isnt one of my favorite people.               &nbsp;               It was Friday and we were leaving that Sunday to go back home. The weather was sunny but the clouds were gray and so was the water. I remember that we placed our blanket and towels close to the lifeguard station. I would be 13 in 4 months and had begun to notice guys. The lifeguard that was on duty most of the time during our beach play was a cute tanned blonde guy. He would smile at us. At 12, I had a C cup and looked olderthe bane of being the first to develop in my class. But I was still naïve and innocent. Not to mention very shy.               &nbsp;               That day, we played in the water, never going past waist level. I remember the waves were strong and kept knocking us over. My brother played in the sand with William, building forts. Lisa, Wayne, Libby and I were in the water. Suddenly our laughter stopped. We felt the water trying to pull us away from the shore and Libby said we should go back to the blankets for a while. &nbsp;  But she slipped and was in a sink holea dip in the floor of the ocean. She called out and I was the closest to her, so I reached for her.                  Suddenly I was swept out by the undertow. &nbsp;  She was probably 6 feet or more in front of me. I started going under. Each time I surfaced, I       screamed for help and swallowed water. I remember seeing a lady at the shore, standing in the shallows, watching me as I went under. I saw Libby moving towards shore, abandoning any attempt to get me, because I was too far  out. &nbsp;                 &nbsp;                &nbsp; Survival instincts took over. I quit &nbsp;  screaming and concentrated on living. I remember thinking, "Kick hard," when I hit bottom       and "Breathe" when I broke surface. After Lord knows how long I did       this. My eyes were open under weather. I saw small silver fish darting, seaweed floating and the bottom of the ocean was a washed out tan. &nbsp;  I remember a fatigue       hitting me so strong that I knew I would be making my last kick to       get my last breath... I thought of my mother and how sad she would       be.                &nbsp;               As I surfaced I barely got a breath before I began to sink. I had       given up. I guess my right hand was still above water, because       suddenly I was yanked upward. When I broke the liquid chains, I heard a voice in my ear, saying, "Relax, I  got you." It was the handsome           blonde lifeguard, who I had covertly checked out earlier. I coughed up water as he swam us back to shore. That swim seemed longer than my       time struggling in the wet prison, trying to fight for my freedom. He kept reassuring me that I was okay, that he wouldnt let me go.             &nbsp;         My cousin William had run to tell his mom that I couldnt get out of the waterthe lifeguard overheard him. Libby and the other kids were screaming at the woman in the shallows to do something. I guess she thought we were playing a game, because she ignored them. Thank God William ran over to his mom or I would have died. We went back to the motel room, after I was able to stand. The Lifeguard stayed by my side the whole time. Ill never forget how safe I felt. It was like being wrapped in an emotional security blanket.       &nbsp;         I blotted out a lot of it for yearsthe burning of my lungs, the taste of salt water and the consequential vomiting afterwards. You know, some say that right before you die that your life flashes before your eyes. Mine didnt. I felt sadness for my Mom, but it wasnt the strongest feeling I had as I struggled. I fought hard to live. For days, the muscles in my body, mainly my legs and arms were strained. But when I accepted that I couldnt fight anymore, I knew a peace that I have yet to feel again in my life. When I embraced it, the vivid image of the being in the water and aware of my surrounding started to dim. My eyes closed and thats all I remember, as I started sinking. Death would have been peaceful, like sleep I think. Though that peace offered comfort, nothing made my heart as happy as knowing I was saved and I would see Mom again.       &nbsp;        I still love the ocean. It taught me that &nbsp;  beauty can be deadly.

       In a corner of my garden   grows a patch of chives,    purple  heads bowing low   in the morning sun.   &nbsp;   Their long arms wispy   trying to tickle some   basil that grows near by.   &nbsp;   Gentle and fragile   the chives look   though their fragrance   is slightly pungent.   &nbsp;   They seem to be    flirting with the other herbs   adding a bit of spice    to my summer garden.   &nbsp;   ~~~ I have a flower pot full of chives. And there's a wild patch of basil growing close to it. The chives are hanging over the pot, stretching towards the basil as if to embrace it.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       I wonder if others are getting a spam advert for viagra in their bulk folders in yahoo mail with the subject header:&nbsp; wanna bang like a horse?   &nbsp;   Do horses bang?   &nbsp;   Drums maybe or even guns... but not horses, they gallop and neigh   &nbsp;   if I were a guy, and I saw that advert, I would think..."I'll never bang like a horse even with viagra. But... bang like a gun.... that I'll go for!"&nbsp;    &nbsp;   I mean isn't that the purpose of viagra... to help you have an&nbsp;erection so you can... shoot???

       Boy, is it coming down!!!!!!! I'm surprise we've gotten this much today.   One set of customers couldn't leave because it was raining so hard for 30 mins.   Looks like Elizabeth's visit will be a rainy one. She's been emailing me and we're both excited. She's a blonde! The white sheep of the family. hehe When she visits, Ben won't be the only blonde hair shining.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       Boy what a day!   &nbsp;   I've actually gotten a lot of work done, despite chatting with Sara for a while and emailing back and forth with Marilyn and an old friend from my college days.   &nbsp;   My local bestfriend Mary called and we yakked and gossiped for a long time.   All the while I worked and worked!   &nbsp;   The photo I'm restoring is an old polaroid that is peeling away. I've got 99% of it finished.   My next few projects aren't going to be as much fun, all are in horrid shape--simply horrid.&nbsp; A word of advice---don't peel photos that are stuck to the glass off the glass--its possible for photographers who know what they're doing to copy the photo through the glass!!!   &nbsp;   Then... an hour ago.. my half-sister Elizabeth calls!!!!! I've only met her once back in 1998. A long story that I may write one day soon. Anyway, she had received a letter from Dad that was depressing and she is trying to plan a visit for this weekend. She's in Greensboro. I'm to call her tonight and see what I can figure out. Its awkard--talking to her. She thinks we've always been around Dad but we haven't. He tends to add gloss to his role in our life when we were growing up. I know Elizabeth has issues with him...hell, we all do, but I've managed to put mine aside.&nbsp; I have a feeling an interesting and emotional phone call is awaiting tonight.

       I seek the sun,   harsh and bright;   an orb burning my eyes,   so that the glare of love   does not blind me.      You of olive skin and guitar,   playing melodies that strike   my heart with discord,   for there is truth in your eyes   that I cannot abide.      Fantasies flit across my garden,   like butterflies over flowers   confused by the multiple choices.   Engraved on the soft petals   are the words I long to whisper.      How proud love can be!   Revealing cobwebs in my corners,   the dust of my past clinging to them!   On your olive complexion, I find   a drop of ruby and realize love put it there.      The sun is a bleeding day moon   that laughs at my attempts    to shun love from the curves    of my beating fragile heart.   Olive hues glitter on a guitar.   ~*~*~    This poem came to me after reading Neruda last night. I was very sleepy but knew if I let it slip away that I would regret it. So I penned the poem on a receipt I found on the beside table. The inspiration is from my past--the memories of fighting love, even as I longed to embrace it.

       My brother didn't come home until after 2 am. I had just dozed off. He made so much noise, I thought the house was falling in. So I didn't go back to sleep until almost 4. I'm tired today! It will be an early night for me.   &nbsp;   While waiting to fall asleep, I read some classic poetry, looking for some poems about storms. I got off track when I came across William Blake's poetry section in the book. I'm inspired to write some hopefully quality poetry.    &nbsp;   That is if I can stay awake... time for some coffee.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;                                   my website   &nbsp;               &nbsp;

       &nbsp;      The Immediate future Card is the Four of Wands. A celebration of home and work done. Prosperity. A&nbsp;reminder that celebrating one's success is wonderful, but once the party's over--get back to work.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   A good card to have--The Four of Wands, except for the future Envirnoment card which is The Tower!!!!     How does it influence the Four of Wands? Good question! The Tower represents sudden change--sudden destruction but look closely at the card--the foundation was not build on solid ground. The tower was destined to fall. Many relationships are built on shaky ground, with false dreams and unrealistic hopes.&nbsp; Without proper structure, they fall apart. I think that this card can mean any dream that you have, any hope or wish that's within your heart or even a belief you place in a person, an establishment or even a theory. But these towers are made to fall, and when the fall happens you have to make some choices of clearing out the rubble and debris and seeing if its salvagable or simply moving to stable ground and rebuilding. Whatever the choice, examine why the structure fell in the first place. ...So how  does the Tower influence the Four of Wands? It means that while the Tower falls around me, I'll keep a happy face in spite of it all.    My Outcome card:          &nbsp;The Nine of Pentacles. This card deals with Self-Reliance. Let me pull all the cards together now. I've been feeling restricted lately (8 of Swords), as if the restrictions are out of my control. In trying to gain insight on them, I've been reflecting on the pain of my past (3 of Swords.) This reflection has taken me on a spiritual journey (6 of Swords), where I am realizing how much I've learned from my past and knowledge&nbsp;has come full circle (The World).    But also, as I reflect on the past, my future is affected by my thoughts and even actions taken after the reflection. Some new beliefs may be sacrificed along with the old and so they will crumble. (The Tower's envirnomental effect)Yet in the midst of the turmoil, I'll keep a happy face and try to find something good in the fall out. (4 of Wands)   The Nine of Pentacles suggests that I will fall back on being self-reliant. That I'll break the bounds once I've learned whatever lesson I'm to learn. The business of life is important, but I'll focus on the finer things. I'll sacrifice for the moment but the results will be well worth it. I will trust my ability to handle any situation.

        card pulled for the Reading is the Eight of Swords:   Self-imprisionment, Self-restrictions, being in a limbo.   Notice that lady's feet do not touch the ground.   There are swords around her but the bindings are loose&nbsp;&amp; her feet are free.&nbsp; Behind her is a Castle, a place she can escape too.   &nbsp;   Some call this card the "Damsel-in-Distress" card--   am I waiting to be rescued? No, I didn't get that impression when   I pulled the card.&nbsp; I feel that I am in limbo with lack of sensory input.   That my restrictions are not imposed by me, but by the duties that my life requests of me.    &nbsp;    &nbsp;The Immediate Past is the Three of Swords. My past failures and heartaches in relationships. A reminder that I have wanted what my heart cannot have. And though the pain was distressful over the loss, it was a pain I had to experience, because loss is a part of loving.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;    The Present Card is The Six of Swords. Three Swords in a row!   Swords represent Air--mental challenges and strife! This card tells me that I am moving out of troubled waters and into smoother ones.   That I am letting go of the past and moving on because I have gained knowledge through lessons learned. It is a card of hope.   The shore does look inviting.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;    &nbsp;The World crosses my Present card--The Six of Swords. It reinforces that a cycle has been completed. Knowledge and wisdom gain through experience.    &nbsp;   ~I've been reflective of late on the past and trying not to make the mistakes that I am prone to doing. But as I reflect, I realize how different I am now and how much I've grown through the loses that I've been forced to endure. I can look them in the eye now and realize that I am stronger because of what I've experienced.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   .   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       Before I post it...here's how I view Tarot readings--as a tool for insight and mediation and  NOT  as fortune-telling. I do not believe our fate is written in stone. I believe our choices direct our path. I use Tarot to explore a feeling or a situation and give it insight that I may not be able to see.    &nbsp;   If I don't have a question in mind, I pull a card from the deck--first I shuffle until the cards don't want to mush together easily. I cut with my neutral hand--my left hand and move the top stack to the left of the deck, and pull the card off the top of what's left of the original deck.&nbsp; Once I have the subject, I reshuffle the cards until they either feel 'done' or don't mush well together.   &nbsp;   When I put cards back in the deck from other readings, I make sure they are right side up---because I feel that the cards will tell me what I need to know without reversals. But if I do somehow get a reversal, I pay extra attention to the card. In this reading they were all uprights and the deck I use is the Universal Waite deck--a softer variation of the Rider-Waite-Smith Deck.   &nbsp;   The Spread I use is a simplified version of the Celtic Cross.&nbsp; Six cards for the reading and a 7th card pulled for the subject.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       Wow... took a nice nap! Don't know what woke me up... I'm half expecting my brother to pop in at any time now. Maybe that's what woke me--the anticipation of his noise. hehe   &nbsp;   Nothing on TV.    &nbsp;   I do a weekly Tarot reading for a friend and came on to post it.    Which made me think of my reading from Thurs. I mentioned it earlier today,   so I'll post it next...once my cup of Black Cherry tea steeps.

         Still feels like morning! Maybe because its unseasonably cool out. Not that I'm complaining! Turned the AC off and have the windows open, so fresh air can get in.   &nbsp;   Went through a range of emotional ups and downs last night. I did a Tarot reading for myself (something I rarely do) the other night which I should post because it is very insightful and interesting--at least to me it is. Been feeling as if I'm in limbo--as if something could happen if I remove the restrictions around me. But how easy it that to actually do!!!!???!!! Not very!   &nbsp;   We all have our duties and tasks that must be done--whether we want to or not. If it were so easy to run free, I wonder if we would really want that. As we soar through the sky, higher than the clouds maybe even looking down at heaven, would we long for gilded cages?   &nbsp;   Ha.. see what two cups of gormet coffee does for me--this flavor is cinnamon crumb cake. Pretty yummy with cream.   &nbsp;   My brother spent the night at my cousin's house. I guess I'll go pick him up at 1 ish. Then cook a late lunch. Not sure what that will be yet--maybe spaghetti. I still haven't put the bookcase together that I picked up a few weeks ago. I dread it. Maybe I'll slip a movie in the DVD player as I work.. Yeah, that's an incentive... see Java makes me think.   &nbsp;   Now that's I've been silly through most of this post, I'll send it along and get motivated.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;                                    my website   &nbsp;               &nbsp;

       Sometimes I feel as if I live my life on the edge of shadows,   never fully basking in the sun nor lounging in the moon's dark side.   A fine line I somehow balance where part of me is dawn   and the other half of me is dusk.   &nbsp;   A battle of conflicting lighting, of constant turmoil--   yet somehow I survive in this confliction of karma.   Will I ever feel the warmth of sun burning my face?   Shall I never see the ebony of a dreamless night?   &nbsp;   I feel half alive, in limbo as if on a thin mist cloud   hovering over solid ground, my feet longing for contact.   How long will this stagnation last, I wonder?   For eternity? If so, how will my soul survive?                                   my website   &nbsp;               &nbsp;

       I had planned to go out for a while but decided to practice my belly dancing. I've been lax with it this summer. Like a dummy I did a cardio vascular shimmy workout, which left me weak....after my shower, I felt even more lazy.   &nbsp;   So I polished my toe nails and my fingernails   this   color.&nbsp;   &nbsp;Did some other top-secret feminine stuff.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   Now, I'm goofing off online, visiting sites I haven't in ages. Checking out the books at Half.com and also contemplating a hour of website updating... or maybe not.   &nbsp;   I'm kinda in a writing mood. I think my art muse needs a rest. hehe   &nbsp;   &nbsp;                                   my website   &nbsp;               &nbsp;

       Today is the first day that I haven't had a rush job to do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I've got other orders to work on but they aren't due out till next week.   Last night I was so tired, I did some sketching in a sketch book    and had my lights out by 11:30.    &nbsp;   Sometimes I get so angry with my drawing hand, because I can't draw as good as I used to.&nbsp; My hand bothered me for 5 years before I saw a doctor and the only reason I did was because it had swollen almost twice its size. I couldn't bend my fingers. After seeing 3 different doctors, it was confirmed I had Carpal Tunnel Syndrome...and if operated on the prognosis wasn't all that great.. a 40-60% ration. Now if the ratio was reversed, I might would go for the surgery but.. I don't want to take a chance and lose the remaining use of my hand.    &nbsp;   So what do I do... I draw a little at a time when I can. I take Advil or Alieve in the am with breakfast. Do some exercises that help relieve the pressure on the carpal tunnel nerve and thank God daily for what I can do with my hand.   &nbsp;   So far, its not gotten worse --tho in the summer and winter it bothers me muchly. Today its stiff but typing is helping to loosen up the fingers.   &nbsp;   Man, didn't mean to run off about CTS.   &nbsp;   Saw&nbsp; the Village on Thursday. A good flick. Not as good as Signs but still good. Neat twist to the film. I bet the critics are having a hard time with this one, because if they write too much about the plot it gives the story away and would ruin it. I went in blindly, only vaguely remembering what I saw of the previews during the promotional stage of the film. I'm glad I didn't know much. I couldn't figure it out... and when the twist was revealed I wondered... was I hearing it wrong???? When I realized what was happening I was like... WOW ... this guy's a Genuis!!!&nbsp; I can't compare it to another film because there isn't one to compare it to.. so&nbsp;my normal&nbsp;rating scale is useless. But I do recommend it, if you like movies that are unusual.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;                                   my website   &nbsp;               &nbsp;

         I looked for your face last night, through the veils of heavy clouds. How I longed to see your smile, ever crescent and thin. Yet darkness clung to your shadows, never letting light through the thick cloud blanket. So I waited under the magnolia tree, humbled by a hot August night's refusal to let lovers meet under a small moon smile.

       I've had a bevy of rush orders this week. Hopefully today will be a lighter day and I can catch up on some online stuff. I know I won't be able to tonight. Both nephews are spending the evening with me. After playing with them, I'll be desiring some quiet time.   &nbsp;   William's first few days of school have been very good. We're kind of relieved. The teacher has two assistants who help her with the class. Every day Will brings home a folder that contained&nbsp;his homework, work done at school, special announcements and a daily log of what he did, how he acted and the stuff he needs to work on at home. Yes he had homework! We read a book together nightly and he does stuff like color blocks and count them, match like pictures and other simple tasks that help him with eye hand coordination. He's not too good at holding a pencil or crayon. There are a lot of things he is behind on. When he was diagnosed with Autism, the doctors told my sister that her smallest child would pass William quickly. That may be so in some things...but William hold some surprises I think.   &nbsp;   I've been doing some thinking this week as I worked on the photos I had to rush through..mainly about love and how we can't let it go...when it's not ours to begin with. How sometimes we try to manipulate people into loving us...which only serves to wound our souls because no matter how much we cling to the love, if its not ours...its not ours...no matter how desperately we deem it so.&nbsp; I may write about that later... right now, the perfect cup of coffee awaits.                                   my website   &nbsp;               &nbsp;

       ...I'm referring to our local Elvis Impressionist.   He works for the local Sheriff's office and does birthday parties, etc in his spare time.   I've seen him perform once and he is actually very good.   &nbsp;   His younger brother, Scott and I were in the same class at school.    &nbsp;   Anyway, he brought a photo that he wants retouched so that he can use it for publicity shots. He stayed forever talking about this and that and Scott and his other brothers. Right before he leaves he asks if I can have the photo ready by noon tomorrow.   &nbsp;   Well, its got a load of stuff in the background that needs to be removed. Jobs like these usually take me a few days to do. But when he said, "Darlin', I got faith in you" in his Elvis voice. What's a girl to do!   &nbsp;   I told him I would have them ready by 11. &lt;sheepish grin&gt;

        There is no poetry in my soul today.      Every tender thought has vanished under my fingertips      as I grip my pen to write.      Love is a glimpse of heaven some say.      But I wonder if that's true.      Every sip I drank of love's potent potion has left me thirsty,      each draught even more potent than the last.      An addiction has formed that I cannot seem to shake,      even when my cup is full.      Love is hell, I think.      Its consumption burning me while its absence leaves me in a freeze      that death cannot touch.      With each kiss I receive, I die a little.      Is there salvation for me,      from this hell that love brings with its promises and desires?          ~I think I've been reading too much of Romeo Blue's poetry. hehe

      What happened to Monday? It flew by.  The weekend was fun. Both birthday parties went well. I think the nephews enjoyed it more than we did.  Sunday while we were eating dinner with Dad, Ben put his finger on the pepper shaker and called it "Dirt." Lisa told him it wasn't dirt. I had to laugh though, no wonder he eats it sometimes--dirt that is.  William starts 'big school' tomorrow. Kindergarten. He's excited and we're all nervous. But I think the change will do him good. He's gotten bored with the daycare and his mind is so active that he needs constant challenges or he gets very bored.  Ah... the sun is smiling from around the clouds. Let's hope he stays awhile. I'm tired of rain.  But I know that August will be a wet month. It usually is.  Just got an email from a Belly Dance site that's having a costume sale. Uh oh... let me delete it. hehe I have plenty of outfits for the moment. In a week I'll start dancing again.   opps gotta run. Elvis is here
