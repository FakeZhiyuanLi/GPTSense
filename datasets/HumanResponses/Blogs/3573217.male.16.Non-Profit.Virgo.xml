      hello young earthlings if you have'nt heard i had an opp on my face to fix my cheek bone which was not that scary i just really could'nt be assed to have it done as i just got better and could skate again but thats back out the window again god damn it i can't skate for 3 months fuck that more like 1 month. i suppose this time i am given can go to some good use like get a job and stuff like that but that i think is just not gonna happen.  yeah hospital was boring but was'nt that bad took my time to rest up. i told mum about all the tattoos i want and she did'nt seem to care really i was like mum gonna have a heart on my right wrist gonna have a star on my right sholder and jack on my right hand side and she was just like umm ok but they will go gay when your like 60 but by that time i should be married or something so i really don't care but hey  send a message to keturah this morning saying that i did'nt love her before and just saying that i really liked her but she came over to the hospital last night and that made me realise that she must love me a heck of a lot to do that for me so then something just clicked in my head and told me the next morning that i mush really love her for that and i really do she's a babe so then i said i loved her should of really been face to face but i have'nt really seen her but next time i do i'll tell her, i just really could'nt see my self with out her by my side anymore i would miss her to god damn much if she ever left me because i sure as hell know that i will not be the one braking up with her because she means loads to me and i don't want to lose that.  so yeah i ca't blow my nose for 3 weeks again cunts i hate the bastards that done this to me i mean not being able to blow your nose how harsh  best be running laters xxx
