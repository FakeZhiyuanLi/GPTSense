       HI, MY BROTHER IS LIKE THE MEANEST PERSON IN THE WORLD. HE CALLS ME NAMES. WELL THE NAMES ARE TOO BAD TO BE SAD ON THE INTERNET. HE THINKS THAT IS ALL THAT JUST BECAUSE HE IS THE MAN OF THE HOUSE .  EVERY TIME THAT HE COMES OUT OF HIS ROOM HE PICKS ON ME AND MY SISTER. ONE DAY I  AM GOING TO SHOW HIM WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE PICKED ON. I GET PICKED ON ENOUGH AT HOME THEN AT SCHOOL. HE IS ALWAYS ON THE INTERNET. YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO LET HIM ON BECAUSE HE THINKS THAT HE HAS BETTER THINGS TO DO ON THE INTERNET. HE SAYS THAT HE IS THE BEST PERSON THAT IS IN SHAPE AND MORE SPECIAL. I'M THE YOUNGEST SISTER SO I ALWAYS GET PICKED ON. I LOOK BETTER THEN HE WILL EVER LOOK AS IN CUTE ,SEXY,ECT. WELL NOW HE CAN DRIVE . NOW THAT MAKES HIM FEEL AL COOL AND BETTER THEN US. HE IS SO WRONG!!! WELL I WILL COME BACK LATER AND TELL YOU WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON IN MY LIFE.

       Hi, my name is Janelle and this is my blog. My life is messed up and weird somtimes. Well most of the time my life is weird. I have a sister, 2 brothers, a mom,and a dad. One of my brothers are in jail and the other one is in track and cross country. My parents are devoriced and my sister is just my sister. some of you other people may think that your life if weirder then mine, you may be right but now i think that my life is weirder.    There are these boys that play down in the feild by my house. They always pick on me . They say that im fat and well, maybe they are right. But i'm not that fat.Just a little. Everywhere i go they are close by.   My life is not the way that I would have pictured it to be. I have only have one boyfriend and i'm not that good looking. I just want people to like me for who i am and not like me because i am fat.My life is not the way i would havve wanted it to be. My life is so not nice.
