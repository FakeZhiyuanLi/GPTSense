      Which looks like it may throw me a loop in my schedule, eventually making it impossible for me to keep up my every-day practicing.  It may make playing open mic this week impossible too.  DRATS!  Well, we must be responsible now and have priorities...my enthusiasm has not faltered and I can still sing in my head.  "Remember me, I used to live for music.  Remember me, I brought your groceries in."

      The title of my blog is from the Leonard Cohen song "Anthem".  The refrain reads, "Ring the bells that still can ring, forget your perfect offering.  There is a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in."  The most powerful moment of the Leonard Cohen Event for me was the finale of the Friday night concert when the performers did a rousing version of Anthem, with everyone singing along and feeling the joy of our togetherness.  And so I've named my blog after that moment, thank you everyone.

      I have now played my guitar and practiced 11 days in a row.  I don't think that's happened since I was married almost eight years ago.  I've got Anthem and Passing Through ready to go, and since I still have the other already mentioned LC songs ready I would have a whole set if needed, and that doesn't count finger picking which I could do too.  Not sure what night this week will be available for my return to open mic.  My newly rejuvenated attitude helped lead to a good Fathers Day too.  I remember several years ago I was asked to sing the "first dance song" at the wedding of Jen and Shawn, Jen is my wife's sister.  I was honored to do it, while I've been told I have a good voice forever I don't really have a wedding singer sort of voice and I'm rarely asked.  I did a Tom Waits song "Little Bit of Heaven" I believe the name is.  I had worked very hard on it, I wanted to get it right, it meant alot to me to do a good job for them.  I didn't have the chance to rehearse with the band so I just went over and over with the record for weeks.  So I finish the song and of course people applaud as they should for the newly married couple.  And on my way back to my seat a fellow comes over to me and says "I just want to let you know how wonderful your singing was, that song was just beautiful."  "Thank you" I said.  "I mean it" he says.  "I appreciate it, thank you" I said (I certainly didn't think he was complimenting me without being sincere.)  Then he said "I came all this way from Boston, and I wasn't sure why I was here, and then I heard you sing and now I know why I had to be here, I had to be here to hear you sing.  Thank you thank you."  I was quite taken aback, and of course I thanked him again.  I've never forgotten it, it is a reminder of how we can reach other people even when we don't expect it.  And years later he had the opportunity to get me a signed copy of Mick Foley's "Have a Nice Day" when Jen pulled my name from the family Christmas raffle.  Thanks man, I've never forgotten you!

      Taking a break from digging a garden border in the front yard...a major achievement for me this week in that I've played my guitar and practiced songs every night this week.  I don't think I've done that since son #1 was born.  Even if its just 5 minutes it must be every night.  "Anthem" is coming together nicely, as is "First we take Manhattan" although I'm having some issues with nailing the notes at the beginning of the cross-verse (I'd really like to live beside you baby...).  I've also been working on "Memories" but I don't know it too well, I need to take the pain and put on Death of a Ladies Man one time and listen, ouch!!!  (Sorry Leonard, not your fault)  Thank you Don for inspiring that one.  Another inspiration was Richard McGraw with both Diamonds in the Mine and Passing Through, but of which will require little practice.  Looking in the free and non-free papers from yesterday I see that there are more open mics than ever, of course I have no idea which one would be "best" for me, but the big key is that if I go to one and it's not to my liking, I must not do what I've done so many times in my life.  I must not just go home and climb into my "shell", I must just keep trying.  Thank you to everyone at the Leonard Cohen Event for making that reality real for me.  Somehow I've kept the good feelings all week, the good feelings that came from the Event and the positive responses to my performances.  Back to work...

      I've been singing/performing for as long as I can remember, some of my earliest memories are of singing for the old ladies at the nursing home where my great-grandmother lived.  I remember them having a little chord organ, and I would sing and play and they would clap.  If I recall correctly my hit song was "On Top of Old Smokey"!!  I think most singers have memories like these, maybe we're always hoping that an audience will react to us like adoring adults once did.  In high school I was chorus president, won the chorus award (2 years) and was lead in the school show in 11th grade.  In college I performed in two musical productions, and then after college I was a member of several strong choruses including the Buffalo Philharmonic Chorus, then known as the Buffalo Schola Cantorum.  Throughout the time from teenage years on I've played guitar and sang.  I've probably always been my own worst critic, although I think most people generally are.  For this week I have a family, home and work to catch up with after the long weekend away, my plan is to start with open mic next week, performing Leonard Cohen songs.  For those who know his music, I did "Lover, Lover, Lover", "Halleluia", "Stories of the Street" and "Lady Midnight".  From the weekend my top songs to learn well enough to play out are "Memories", "The Future" and "Anthem".  We'll see where this goes, I took the time to practice last night which unfortunately hasn't always been the case.  There are pictures of me at the Leonard Cohen Event on the internet already, when I have time to figure out how to put a link in here I'll do that.  Haven't told anyone I know about this blog yet, I think I'm going to wait until I have enough here to show I'm committed to keeping it, and then I'll tell people.  Thank you to everyone who gave me such nice compliments at the Event, somehow life hasn't robbed me of the happy feelings yet...it's been four days and that's pretty good for me!

      I would like to provide a brief introduction to my blog, I'm very new to this and not totally sure what direction this is going to go in.  If you're reading this I welcome you and hope that you'll leave me a comment.

My name is John Kloberdanz and I'm from Buffalo, New York.  This blog is my opportunity to share a bit of myself, and provide me with some motivation...more on this to follow.  I've given my real name and location, so I can't imagine they'll be anything controversial!!

Two days ago, I returned from The 2004 Leonard Cohen Event in New York City.  It was an awesome life experience on many levels, including the positive feedback I received on my performances of Leonard's songs.  While I've been complimented on my singing voice for as long as I can remember, I've never received that level of affirmation around my guitar/singing performances.  It's left me with a feeling of confidence that I don't want to lose!  Heck, I'm 43 so it's about time I had some confidence over what I do!

My first goal is to begin playing at open mic again, as I had started last year around this time but then stopped when my favorite bar closed in the fall.  I went almost every week for about five months.  I hadn't performed open mic in almost 20 years before then, so this had been a huge step.  I haven't been since the fall, and I'm not sure where I'll go but it really doesn't matter.

On a personal note, the most important thing in my life is my family; my wife and two beautiful boys.  Absence of them in my writing will not reflect a lack of caring, but would merely be off-topic.

Stay tuned....
