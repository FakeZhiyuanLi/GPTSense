      I don't know how life could be this mean after all the turmoils i've just gone through. Things are getting too wacky the past days that i feel like i need to let out one big scream to make me feel better. First, I got a very urgent pleading text from an old friend making me give the biggest LIE in my entire life. I hate myself for not being able to say no, it's just too hard for me to let a friend down. I've come to realize over the years that the only magic word a friend has to say is 'please' and off i go, doing whatever i can just to prove my being a friend. She told me about her script hours before she arrived and it was just an overview so i told her i had to know the details so at least we'll be consistent. Ok here's the act:  Her brother's waiting for her at the bus station coz he's getting something he asked her to buy for him and since her reason of coming to Manila was to attend my wedding the following day, I have to pick her up from the station and make some small talk with her brother. Ridiculous!!! I don't know if i wanted to laugh or get mad when i read her message. I just can't believe she wasnt able to think of some other more convincing excuse than me getting married! When she told me over a month ago that she had plans of coming to Manila just to meet some guy she's been texting with,I already told her what i thought about it. Knowing her boyfriend as a really nice guy (as far as i know) and having spent time with them in the past, i would never ever encourage her to cheat on him nor would i back her up on doing something i know is wrong. But I can only give her advice if she asks for one and i have no intentions of telling her what she should and shouldn't do. I know my limitations as a friend and there are certain boundaries i opt not to cross. I was able to convince her to meet me up somewhere near my place. I almost stammered when her brother asked me what time the wedding was, "ummnn...after lunch" was my reply while looking squarely at my friend.  Then we had to wait for an hour for the guy to come pick her up from their meeting place. I really felt so guilty. I wish she had just asked me some favors other than that. No matter how hard i try i just couldnt find any reason that would make sense on why she had to cheat on her bf....... maybe she still loves him? But why would you cheat on someone you love? It just doesnt make any sense. OK, it's over and done. The next blow came Sunday night. I got a call from another old friend who's working abroad right now. I wanted to hear her side of the story since the chaos started but we lost touch and i thought it was up to her if she really wanted me to know she will contact me since i havent changed my number yet. So that was last night. She's coming home in two weeks and she said she'll show me all the evidence she got and tell me everything she knows. Honestly, i dont want to get dragged on this, it doesnt concern me at all...but since it concerns the person i've considered my bestfriend for 13 years now, i can't do anything but get smudged. It's being torn between two people that hurts me the most. I've known the other one for almost 20 years now and i can say that i know her well enough. It's so frustrating to be put right in the middle of two friends fighting over some guy, of not knowing which story to believe, of having to listen and evaluate things based on their feeds. Of doubting the other and asking myself what if what the other's saying is true and what if she'll do the same thing to me? It's having to deal with trust and trying to sustain what's left of the friendship we had. I never imagined things would turn out this way when we've been helping each other move onward.  I'm glad we had a meeting this morning, at least my mind has eased a bit. Right when i thought i finally got myself together, i received messages and missed calls again from my other friend (the accused) saying that our friend did this and that again, that she hopes i'm still her friend etc etc. I'm beginning to think that sometimes when you have lots of friends, you might just get yourself in big trouble. Is it really better than being alone? Oh, crap! You just can't be 100% happy. The ying and yang in life.... sucks right through the bones.

      	My childhood was filled with funny memories. Memories that i still love to reminisce until now. Sometimes, Papi and I would spend the whole night (till the wee hours) talking about the good old days, then we'd laugh together at some foolish things we did. Our sis would just stay there listening, watching and laughing with us.  	My earliest memory was when i was four years old, when we were still living in a cute nipa hut at Magsingal. I loved to play role-playing then. I used to get our white blanket and put it over my head then wear my mom's half-slip up to my armpits so it would look like a long dress. Then I would ask my lil brother to hum the tune of "Here Comes the Bride" as I march around the house.... but well, there was no groom...hahahaha. I didn't know then that a bride should have a groom! 	When I was five, we moved to Batac. I entered my new world when I attended kindergarten. I met more people, had friends and enemies as well. A month before our graduation, i got ill and when I got well, I didn't go back to school coz I thought I wouldn't be able to graduate since I missed a lot. I had a very close friend then who I went to school with everyday...his name was Rocky...that's all I can remember. 	Two years later, when I was seven years and a half, we moved to Vigan, at Grandma's house. That was the time my dad worked abroad. He told us he would feel better if we stay with a relative coz we will be more safe...well, probably he was right. It was really a big adjustment for all of us. The neighborhood was a lot noisier; people speak in a different accent, strange faces, new school, etc etc.  	My grandma enrolled me at the school one block away from our house. I was in the second section, a second grade transferee. After some weeks, i already belonged in a group and began enjoying the new friendship I’ve found. In third grade, Marie transferred to our school. She's our neighbor but we haven't even exchanged a single word when we meet on the streets. We eventually became friends ( I was close with Madz then), and everybody called us "The Tres Marias" coz we always went out together. The crushes started during the third grade too. Madz teased me to Julius and Marie to Rocky...well, Madz said she liked Ryan. The teasing went on till 6th grade but they teased me with another guy during 4th grade. I don't know why I really felt upset everytime they tease him to me (his name was Alano). He was tall, cute, sweet and intelligent too. But maybe it was because he was very naughty. He loved to make people cry.  His sister was very close to me since we're always together at school events. We were on the same investigatory team, the choir (imagine? I was on the choir? hehehe), quiz bees, and other contests. She kept telling me about how her brother likes me and their whole family likes me too. My mom and their mom were really close. But I don't know why I really hate him. Then in 5th grade, I had a terrible crush, which lasted for 5 yrs.  Well, everybody knew him coz I was really very vocal about it. Right, it was Rhigil. I don't know why I liked him. My friends used to ask me but until now, i don't know why. He's three years my senior, and he belonged to another school...Divine Word College. He was a member of the knights of the altar. His schedule was on the 3 o'clock mass, which happened to be our mass (for kids). Alano knew about my crush on Rhigil, and he would often tease me that Rhigil would never like me coz I'm just a kid and he prefer girls the same age as him. Since I really wanted my crush to notice me, I began acting like a "trying-hard lady". I wanted to grow up immediately. In January 1990, three months before our graduation, Alano died. It was very unexpected and everybody was shocked...especially me since I was not in school then because of my chicken pox. Days before that, I visited him in the hospital with my friends (he requested me to go), and he was very healthy and full of energy. His mom said he would only undergo one operation (to remove the shrapnel in his throat), and then he could go back to school again. He was a very big loss to all of us. His family cried when they saw me during his wake...and until now, every time they see me, they can't help but cry coz they say I remind them of him. During his burial, I can't help my tears from falling. I tried so hard not to sob. I took him for granted not realizing the fact that a time like this would come when all I could do is look back at something I already had in front of me yet my eyes were set too far to see. I wished I have told him that I appreciate all the things he did for me...I wish I have thanked him for loving me unconditionally. But I think it's true that you'll only realize how much someone or something means to you the moment that it's gone. You miss it when it's not there. 	In high school, it was not really a very tough start. I had the same circle of friends since we all lived in the same community, and the school is the only public school in the province. We belonged in the first ever "special science class", I-Eureka. Being in the top section (there were 23 sections in 1st yr) was so difficult since all our teachers expected too much from us. We had longer classes than the other sections...a total of 8 hours everyday, Monday to Friday. We had two teachers in Math and Science, and two advance subjects in both. I was the Vice Mayor in our class then so I was asked to run for 1st yr Governor which I could not decline since our adviser was Marie's father. Unfortunately, I only landed second and the governorship was handed to Suzette who was also a friend of mine. I have known from the start that Suzette is really intelligent and I even told my mom that I admire her brains. She was the third in our class in 6th grade though she was a transferee. The competition was between Flong and me since 4th grade. Although I got the first honors in 6th grade, I knew then that I couldn't retain it in high school. His father was a teacher there and I know how he hates me. And I was right. I was still in the honor list but the competition went on between Suzette and Flong. I was out of the picture. It hurt a bit coz I know that many people are expecting too much from me and I’ve let them down. But I felt better. I wouldn't have enjoyed high school if I was academically active. I don't have a single regret. 	It was during my freshman year when I got to know Steven. He was one of the most popular guys in our class. But well, I thought Charleston was the cutie since he was my crush.... hehehe. But I got turned off easily coz he fell asleep in our Social Studies class...duh! Steven was Suzette's crush. And though Madz never admitted, I knew that she liked Steven too. Well, Steven's crush was Madz. Since I was a very naughty girl before, most of my friends were guys. They told me all their crushes and asked me to help them get close. I was the type of person who would never say no and i really did everything I can to help anyone who asked for my help. Steven didn't ask me to help him with Madz. He just loved teasing and hiding my things so I would go chasing him.  It was during the 2nd yr that we got close coz we became seatmates. I was the only girl who was in the guy's row, in between Adrian and Steven (our classroom was the lab). I suddenly became one of the boys, and i began enjoying their company. They were very funny and supportive. I remember the time we had a graded recitation in Geometry, Joseph (the math wizard) who was seated in front of me, told me to raise my hand. I didn't want to coz I didn't know the answer. He told me the answer. When our teacher called me, he even helped me justify my answer. He was my math savior.... he did all my math projects, I copied assignments from him, and he handed me answers during examinations...but I didn't know why they wouldn't let me share those assignments with Steven when in fact they knew that we were very close.  Somehow they had this sort of "guy competition" going on. Nevertheless, I maintained my good relations with them and with Steven at the same time.  Like normal friends, we had our share of occasional fights but we would always make up before it gets worse.  Through my closeness with Steven, I gained some good friends and enemies.  Some girls from other sections would snob me on the corridors knowing that we are a couple...which of course is absurd! But one thing I’m thankful about is having known my female best friend through him.  Agnes and I have been classmates since 1st yr and the idea of her becoming my best bud never occurred to me. She is my total opposite. She had a group before (where Steven, Marie & Madz belonged), which they called "The Naughty" (I eventually detached myself from the "Tres Marias" coz of some personal conflicts and had my own group w/ Jomar and Suzette). Agnes was the liberated kind of girl, loud, sexy and naughty. My group of friends didn’t like the idea of her hanging out with us, with the obvious reason that she was only using me to be able to get close with Steven... I was aware of that, but I started to appreciate the kind of attention and companionship she was giving me that I thought I should not deprive her of the chance to change the image people have implanted in their minds about her. I wanted to help her get out of the tube people have put her into.  This decision jeopardized my friendship with Jomar and Suzette, causing frequent fights between us and eventually, they drew the last straw on me...Agnes or them.  It was a really terrible time in my life.  I was so confused.  I tried to get some space for myself to be able to discern things and come up with a really good decision.  I wanted to keep them both, but they just couldn’t live with each other that I ultimately had to choose.  Most of the people who knew me got really surprised when I chose to stick with Agnes.  It was a tough decision for me too; coz I know my group would totally dissolve and the 4-yr friendship I shared with Jomar (2 yrs with suzette) would never be the same again.  I didn’t tell them my reason for choosing to stay with Agnes then coz I know that whatever valid explanation I give wouldn’t ease the hurt I’ve caused.  My reason I kept for myself, I will let u know now... it seemed to me then that Agnes needed my friendship more than my other two friends did.  She was totally an outcast, with no one else but me. If I were to leave her then, it would be totally drastic. I did what I thought was right.  And I never regret it.  Thankfully, my friendship with Jomar and Suzette continued until 4th year although not as close as we used to be. I can say that my junior year had been the most exciting and colorful of my four years in high school, with my two best friends, Steven and Agnes (who always fought…they just couldn’t get along).  In the summer of 1993, I was taken aback with the unexpected news that Steven and his family had left the country for good.  He even threw a “get away party” where I was not invited.  I was terribly hurt, thinking that maybe he never really considered me his best friend, and the thought that I might not be able to get on with my last year in school without him.  In both of these thoughts, I further realized I was wrong.  Surprisingly, I was the first person he wrote a letter to in school.  Though we never talked about why he had to keep things from me, I understood it wasn’t easy for him too and our friendship went on as normal as before.   As the first months of my final year in high school commenced, I developed a close friendship with the guys particularly Errol who sat before me.  He would always consult Agnes and me about his love life, making us his gift consultants, card authors, and even autograph signers.  After some time, Agnes and I joined Errol’s group (‘D Terrors, where Steven transferred after being a “Naughty”). We didn’t become “Terrors” though; we just hang out with them together with the other all-female group called “Campus Girls” headed by Ianne (a friend of mine since 2nd grade).  It was a big, funny group, which even got tagged by “Banang”(the most-hated Chem teacher) as ‘antagonists’.  I never thought I’d have one of the best years in my life considering my other best friend’s absence.  It was fun and just remembering it now, fills me with mixed emotions.  On that same year, I had the chance of becoming a stage actress (geeze…would u believe that?). I was paired with one of the most popular guys, Ferdinand, of whom I had a big crush since junior year.  It was exciting, outrageous and romantic…. hahahaha.  I could still remember how people reacted about our love team, how everybody thought there was something more than what they see on stage. I was overwhelmed with the attention and compliments I was getting, but it reached a point where the popularity got a bit scary.  Girls who were gaga over him hated and ridiculed me.  So after our stint, I started avoiding him.  Again, I thought it was the right thing for me to do.   Before our last Christmas together as IV-Newtons, I had a big fight with Busoy and Jomar… petty ones that grew big.  I was able to rekindle my friendship with Busoy before our graduation through the help of our group (he was a “Terror”) but my friendship with Jomar was doomed.	It was something I had to accept reluctantly, we were both too proud to admit our flaws and never got the chance to talk things over.

      Another working week has passed. Feel so relieved that at last i can oversleep again, stay lazy for two days and just care about tv shows, some vcds papi has burned or my fave jeopardy game. But i feel really sad coz weekend means another 2 days of not talking to my Paul. Although i can txt him anytime, talking on yahoo is still a whole lot better... he seldom replies on sms coz he's having trouble with his mobile or service i think. Oh but last night he did message me twice hmmmnnn i was so happy plus i got the messages yahoo sms was supposed to send me last week. I didnt know he sent me messages then coz he never mentioned maybe he thought i just didnt reply or anything, but i was a bit worried then when the yahoo sms service started acting up knowing that he might message me once he sees me on and since i cant receive messages he might think i ignored him or something. But that didnt happen, i'm a lucky lucky gril coz my darling didnt think that way. He messaged me before going out but i'm not working late tonite so i'll probably be home once he gets back. We're just missing each other more and more as the days pass. He again told me our love just grows and grows...so happy to know that.  It's funny how i love coming to work every day, and how i don't even want to take a leave even if i badly need a break.... all because of my Paul. Of course, i wont trade talking to him for anything at all... that's the only thing we've got for now. We need it to keep us strong.

       That’s Life   (1994)   So you failed. Now what? Change that pout into a smile Hide your tears and face the world Don’t give up. It’s just a matter of trying, Striving, and of course sacrificing. Learn to accept everything…cheer up!  Don’t rush…you’ll have your time. Just wait. Be patient. It’ll come soon, don’t you worry. Enjoy your youth; it comes but once; And so is your life. Live it to the fullest… You’ll never have it again.  So you loved but lost. That’s life learn to take it! Someday, you’ll be thankful, you once lost For it is where you gained something…  Problems? Oh, that’s what normal people get! It really pays to be normal, isn’t it? Well, that’s just a spice of life Without it, life would be empty. No joy. No warmth. No challenge.  Now, listen. Life isn’t merely pleasure… but pressure. You must live not only for yourself but also for others. Show your essence… be proud you’re human! Give the best you can! That’s life. Take it or leave it?   The Answer   (1996)   Was it your eyes that made me shiver? Or your lips that made me sigh Was it the way you talk in whisper? Or your sweet enchanting smile?  How can I forget the way you tease me And the friendly talks we had? How can I immune myself with your absence And pretend to be happy when I’m sad?  Can I endure this pain much longer? Then lie again and again? Or fill the questions with answers That I’ve tried to hide in vain.   UNTITLED   (1998)   Why does it hurt so badly? Living a life so empty …all alone …with no one to care but my own.  Why do I crave for something Even I cannot explain …unseen …yet I feel the urge to have.  Why am I what I am? Afraid to admit what I feel …puzzled, confused …uncertain that this really is LOVE.   SACRIFICE   (1996)   How can I smile again?      When all I feel is pain?      Go on and say nothing’s wrong      When it isn’t me you belong?  Where else could I turn to?      When all the doors lock up      And the friends I have says no      Who else could make me laugh?  The thought of survival kills      But I have to;  I must live      An empty life and nightly chills      With endurance, your freedom I give.   EDIFICE   (1996)   The sun’s about to set     Darkness envelops the blueness of the sky I stood there, waiting……     Yet you didn’t come.  The next day, at dusk I returned     Waited till my eyes could no longer contain Hoping at least you’d remember     A five-year-old pledge we made here.  Our rendezvous is my witness     Of a love unshattered and patient I shall come again and again     In this edifice --- till you remember.   ASS   (1997)   There he sat silently on his fave bench    He wants to think        But million thoughts preoccupy him.  He tried to talk with Martha     But she didn’t seem to care a bit        He took out a cigarette and silently smoked.  The memories came flashing    The nightmare’s back        But he could hide no more  He should have been a lawyer now    No, a doctor maybe        .……yes, he lost his gold.  Yesterday couldn’t be pulled back    Everything wasted was wasted        Regrets won’t make any difference  Slowly he got up    Headed unto nowhere, no more Martha        Yes, the fool realized what a fool he was!   SORRY….   (1997)   As tears rolled down her cheeks, You uttered the word you thought could heal SORRY.  SORRY… You thought it was some kind of medicine That could wash away the pain That could stop her tears from falling.  Your SORRY shattered her dreams Broke her heart into pieces Yet she still loves you And have forgiven you.  You may be happy now with someone else, But you could never tell if someday You’d come to hear the word you once said …. SORRY.   THE DREAMER IN ME   (1998)   I used to see nothing but rainbows      A blue and sunny sky      Cheerful faces to pacify      Unprepared for the sorrows to come  Yet now I stand in this empty room      Alone, shattered and immune      Don’t know how to move with the tune      Feeling that my life’s in a doom       I tried to retrieve past memories      And can’t help the tears from falling      Over mistakes and failures I gained      Hidden behind my sweet smile.  The dreamer in me is dead      Tired, broken and hopeless      Nothing that I did is good      And there’s no sense in dreaming once more.   FOOL THAT I AM   (1998)   I had you in my heart 	My arms could have pulled you close 	Touched you, cuddled sweetly 	I would have ----- yet I let you go.  I denied I was in love 	Ignored the feeling inside 	Didn’t believe that you love me too 	Yet now, yet now I miss you so.  If only I could pull back the years 	Hold you and say I do 	That I always longed for your touch 	But I could not.  Accept I must this fact 	Though It hurts a lot 	We once shared something mutual that’s so special 	And if we’re meant to share it once more, time can only tell…   I AM WHO I AM   (1998)   This is me 	Indefinable, unpredictable 	Obscure 	Vague.  I am me 	Cheerful, outgoing, moody 	Full of dreams in life 	Simply human.  Just another….. 	Dreamer. Sometimes I stumble 	But I get up with dignity. 	Loser. Oftentimes I lost yet I gain something better.  This is me. I am me. Just another being. Yes, I am who I am.   UNSPOKEN LOVE   ( 1999 – for viki)   She have been bombarded with childhood nightmares No family to claim her own, no loving mother to hug her so… Her body was restless with work And her heart was filled with hatred.  She looked for the missing piece everywhere The love she had been longing to share Men came and went in her life Still, she felt empty inside.  She settled with someone who loved her much Yet she failed to hold the love she grasped It slipped and dripped like sand Abandoned once more, her fate was out of her hand.  Tough as she is, she stood firm Fought the battle and hoped to win She may have lost in many battles But still, she continued her struggle.  Now, as she strives to live the life she’s destined to have I just want her to know that she’s not alone --- never We’ve always been here (with God) from the start Though we don’t say it much I hope she knows How much we love her so.  We take great pride in her strength The undying hope and endurance she possess All these and more are her wealth Which no one else could have.  She has always been our empress in shining armor Always ready to defend us from harm The superwoman of our lives Yes, we’re very proud of our  mom.    FOR ONCE   (2000)   For once in my life I’ve cared for someone For once I’ve cried when love has gone The pain, the memories, lessons learned and time wasted The feelings that still linger filled me with hatred.  I tried to sleep on it, forget his face  And trash his image I tried to bury the love in anger Hoping I would somehow grow in age  With my life’s high and low, The bitterness I gained still show I thought I learned my lesson well But no, I can never tell.  For here I am again Loving right after losing….. Ready for another strike of pain Waiting what love’s gonna bring.  For once in my life I got hurt For once I recovered and stood up I may not have learned enough But I’m glad I still have a heart.   IT’S US, REMEMBER?   (2002)   It was I who wept when you said you failed As I looked into your sad eyes, the pain stayed It was I who assured you that all you have to do is go on That life is full of twists and turns Sometimes you get along, oftentimes you don’t So you need to be strong in order to hold on You looked at me with eyes full of hope And I knew then that you could cope.  It was you who lifted up my spirits Made me feel good and very special It was you whom I held hands and walked with Whose lips I kissed with so much warmth As you whispered how much you love me That it’s more than I could see All I could do was hug you tight Coz I couldn’t ask for more.  It was us who dreamed a happy life together Nice home, good kids ---- a perfect family We believed everything stays well forever And promised to keep the vow of matrimony It was us who have passed lots of trials Of individual differences we’ve learned to overcome Why turn your back now that we’ve gone this far? Why leave me alone when you made me believe it was us? It’s always been you and me from the start Can’t it still be us?   THE MAN I TAUGHT MY HEART TO LOVE   (1993)   The man I taught my heart to love A man intelligent and smart All the good traits he must have To be nearer to my heart  A man who’s understanding enough Fill up all my needs and lack ‘Cause sometimes I’m not that tough All I can do is mock.  A man who is very religious A man who’ll bring me near to God  Teach me not to be loquacious Who’ll cheer me up when I’m sad.  A man who’s handsome in my eyes Even if they say that I’m that blind Someone who’s so nice A man who’ll enlighten up my mind.  A man who must be older than me A year or two or three So my mistakes he can see A man who’ll love me free.  This man I’ve already found A kind so few But all of a sudden he was gone The man I taught my heart to love… Is no other than YOU!   THE CURSE OF LIFE ~   (1999)   Life’s curse hits you when you’re down 	It’s there when you fail 	When you are dumped It hits you hard that you can’t stand up 	It cripples your soul 	Make you feel numb inside It lingers long till you cram up 	It manipulates the way you live 	Let you go where you should not It drives you mad of causes you know not 	It brings out unanswerable questions 	The cause of uncontrollable emotions It pushes you to do things you should have thought twice 	It seems to rule you although it does not 	It does not exist though you chose to believe it does It is a fiction you created to make life an exciting struggle.   That Thing Called...   (1999)   LOVE is something that comes and goes overnight 	Sometimes it lingers, sometimes it does not. 	It is a feeling that drives you to act 	And it can be an act that can give feeling to your heart.  LOVE may not be felt at all times 	But it can be given through our acts 	It is the conscience that dictates us 	And make us feel good inside  LOVE comes in various masks 	I have mine and you have your own match. 	It’s just a matter of preparation and trust. 	The day would come at last.  LOVE is sacrificing your own interest for other’s happiness. 	It is giving up what you like the most. 	And setting free at no cost Yes, love is there when you let go.   ONLY A BEGINNING   (1994 – for IV-Newton batch ’94)   It hurts to see you go But what can I do? I don’t have the right to stop you. You’ve done it well, my friend.  You’re now in line with the so-called graduates Which everyone thinks is the end But dear, do remember Graduation only serves as a beginning.  You’ve only ended light endeavors Heavy ones are still ahead Be prepared and do your best Fight, and make it to the fullest.  A little patience is only needed What you sow is what you’ll reap Your goals in life will soon be real And your dreams won’t remain as dreams.  Just don’t forget to ask God’s help Make way to your struggle I hope to see you soon marching on success For the completion of once a quest.   It Could Be You ~   (1999)   An empty mind came overflowing A numb heart started to feel something Yours is the name that awakens Yours are the eyes tat weakens...  These conflicting emotions arouse confusion Yet I embrace it with conviction It's infrequent and unusual, truly extraordinary A burden I struggle to carry.  In time we'll know all the answers And learn to accept the consequences it bears Take time to stop awhile and think of me Try to imagine if we could ever be.  We're both aware of what we feel  There's something within us that we could be real It could be you who'll end the quest Coz I've found, who for me, is the best.   Silly Heart   (1994)   I'm not sure if I do But he's sure he does I don't know if this feeling's for real But I know how he feels.  What will I do? Could I just stay and pretend? Or will I just ignore? To escape from pains and heartaches?  I feel something inside But i'm not sure what it was And if I'll enter this game I'll be at the losing end.  Everybody's against.... How could I bear such consequences? How could I face asking faces? I'm not sire I can.  “C'mon, try it” my heart says Although trying never harms My mind still never dared try And was contented in giving out a silent sigh.  I'm very much confused I feel like crying I feel like I'm about to give up Now, tell me, what shall I do next?   We Care   (1995)   When problem s beset you ...and you feel you're about to give up hold on...be tough Remember, God cares.  When you're so down and helpless ...and the path you're heading seems rough just smile...take it easy Remember, I'm here.  When friends turn their backs on you ...and your hope seems to drift Don't be lost... keep on striving Who knows, success is only half a mile away?  Don't say you're all alone... don't think you're forsaken don't lose hope... don't lose faith Remember, we both care.

       I DO…..   There were dozens of things that I had told Except for one, ‘cause I’ll feel so bold The word that carries all I feel But once it’s said, I’m in a seal.  I’ve always been afraid to commit myself That’s cause I don’t want to live in a shelf Don’t despair if I don’t say I love you Your ears may not hear it but my heart says I do.  I may seem so far and distant to you at times That’s cause I’m afraid to put you in chimes Sometimes I say cruel words to hide what I feel But you must know that I love you still.  I know you won’t entirely understand But please try to, give me a hand Give me time to say what I feel for you Give me courage to say I do.    Daily Resolution   I’ll forget the love he cherished  	And the warmth it brought to me I’ll forget it lived and perished 	Like some fleeting melody.  All the joy and all the sorrow 	I shall bury out of sight But all these can start tomorrow  	While I think of him tonight!    Loving and Losing   So you love someone but he doesn’t know it? And you’re longing to tell him but you’re afraid and shy? Will you just stay and love him Secretly and perhaps painfully?  You’ll get old that fast my friend Get the feeling of your chest, that’s what you’ll do Go to him and tell him exactly what’s inside of you Forget your foolish pride and don’t regret it afterward  There’s nothing wrong and ugly or undignified about it Loving is such a noble and wonderful thing to do And falling in love is perhaps the greatest gift you can give yourself Say it now and don’t let your golden chances pass you by Else, he’ll slip away and be gone and you’ll never never know  That maybe he loved you too  Look, everybody got a lover Don’t you also have the right to have one? God created us not individuals but in pairs He’ll give you fair share if you truly deserve it  But what if your love got turned down? Should you hide your face and cry? Don’t friend, congratulate yourself either Because you’ve done your part well Tomorrow, you’ll fall in love again Yes, it’s so lonely to lose But I think it’s lonelier to sit all your life And wait for love to come But, it may never come at all….    TEMPER   When I have lost my temper, I have lost my reasons too I’m never proud of anything that angrily I do When I have talked in anger and my cheeks are flaming red I’ve always uttered something that I wish I hadn’t said In anger, I have never done a kindly deed or wise But many things for which I felt I should apologize.  I’m looking back across my life all I’ve lost or made I can’t recall a single time when fury ever paid So I struggle to be patient for I’ve reached a wiser age I do not want to do a thing or speak a word in rage I’ve learned by sad experience that when my temper flies I never do a decent, a decent thing wise. -Ann Anderson    A PRAYER WHEN IN DOUBT   Lord, I have a lot to learn. Through life, I am faced with difficult situations, I am tasked to make decisions; But most of the time I doubt if I know what’s right or wrong Give me the wisdom ---not to know What’s wrong or right but what’s good or bad in your heart. Cast away the doubt and give me the confidence To do what I feel is good. And lead me towards the action which You know is good.    GOD KNOWS BEST   Our father knows what’s best for us So why should we complain? We always want the sunshine But He knows there must be rain  We love the sound of laughter And the merriment of cheer But our hearts would lose their tenderness If we never shed a tear  Our Father tests us often With suffering and with sorrow He tests us not to punish us But to help us meet tomorrow  So whenever we are troubled And when everything seems wrong It is just God working in us To make our spirit strong.    DON’T QUIT   When things go wrong, as they sometimes will When the road you’re trudging seems all uphill When the funds are low and the debts are high And you want to smile but you have to sigh; When cares are passing you down a bit Rest if you must but don’t you quit.  Life is queer with its twists and turns, As every one of us sometimes learns And many a failure turns about When he might have won had he stuck it out, Don’t give up though the pace seems slow…. You might succeed with another blow.  Success is failure turned inside out --- The silver tint of the clouds of doubt And you never can tell how close you are It may be near when it seems so far So stick to the fight when you’re hardest hit It’s when things seem worst that you must not QUIT.    MAKE IT WITH YOU   A simple request from your heart to mine To be together, it’s a matter of time I know deep inside, our dream will come true To be together as one, just me and you  Each day that passes I thank my lucky stars That you’re safe and sound wherever you are I can only imagine your smiling face Then the vision vanishes without a trace  I miss you more to just hear your voice But that’s all we’ve got, we have no choice If I could have just one dream come true I’d dream a dream that I could make it with you

       AYOKO NA MUNANG UMIBIG   (1993)   Ayoko na……. 		Dulot mo’y pawang pasakit 		Sakit ng ulo at punyal sa dibdib 		Pagkabigo’t pagluha ang sinapit 		Pawang kabiguan sa larangan ng pag-ibig  Ayoko na……. 		Ang muli pang umasa 		Na karaniwa’y nauuwi sa wala 		Ang pag-asam at pagnasa 		Ng tunay na pag-ibig na laging naaantala  Ayoko na……. 		Hatid mo pala’y pagdurusa 		Hapdi sa puso’t dagdag na suliranin                 Panandaliang  ligayang udlot ding napapawi                 At sa bandang huli’y labis na pagsisisi  Ayoko na……. 		Ang muling umibig sa ngayon 		Na sa tuwina’y  kabiguan ang hatid 		Ayoko na ang muling malito 		Saka na…..kapag ako’y handa na.   HINDI PA HULI ANG PAGSISISI   (1993)   Nagsisisi ako nang mahalin kita You’re not capable pala Gaga ako ng magkagusto sa yo Ngayon, labis ang pagsisisi ko.  Mabuti na lang at ako’y natuto Nagising sa bangungot ko Ikaw pala ang monster sa buhay ko Akala ko noo’y prince charming ko  Ngayong ako’y nauntog na, Nabukulan at nablackeye pa Ayoko nang magpatuloy… Ayoko na sa ‘yo.  Tama ang sabi nila Ako nga’y talagang gaga Di kita dapat minahal Pinag-aksayahan oras ko’t pagmamahal Ngayon, ako’y masaya na,pagka’t limot na kita.  Salamat sa nakaraang panaginip Pag-ibig na inalay sa yo Salamat at ako’y natauhan Iba na ang aking minamahal Hindi na kita kailangan.    AGBAGTITAK SAN   (1999)   Ano’ng oras na, wala pa akong nagagawa Araw-araw na lamang ba akong tutunganga? Labis na ang inip na aking nadarama Pagkabagot ko’y di na matantiya Sa paglipas ng oras, pagkabalisa ko’y lumalala Kailan kaya ako lubusang sasaya?  Ang lahat na yata’y aking inaalala Maging problema ni Petra’y pilit kong dinadala Sariling suliranin ay di ko na nga makaya Yun pa kayang bumabagabag sa iba?  Di nila pansin, ngiti ko’y mapakla Malakas kong pagtawa ay hungkag sa tenga Lungkot sa mukha, kung minsan ay maskara Di maipahiwatig ang tunay na nadarama Kunwariang halakhak, kunwariang luha Katauhang sa wari ko’y taliwas sa isa’t isa  Bukas sa aking paggising, babalik ang pagtataka Bakit ako nandito, ano ang aking sadya? Buhay ko ba’y may halaga o ako’y balewala? Pakisagot naman -----baka agbagtitakon.    AKALA KO   (1994)   Akala ko…. 	di kita mahal, 	di iniibig at pinahahalagahan 	ngunit ba’t ngayong wala ka na 	nais kong balik-balikan, mga nagdaan?  Akala ko…. 	minahal mo ako 	yun pala’y ni halaga wala ako 	labis akong umasa sa wala 	ngayo’y ako rin ang labis na nagdurusa.  Akala ko…. 	palagi kang nariyan 	na pag nabigo’y handang takbuhan 	gawing sandalan magpakailanman 	yun pala, tulad nila ikaw ri’y mawawala.  Akala ko… 	sa bandang huli’y ikaw at ako 	subalit laking pagkakamali ko 	sarili ko ngayon ang labis na sinisisi 	sa kinasadlakan ng puso kong sawi.   Ikaw..........sa Bagong Mundo   (1994 – for IV-Newton batch ’94)   Akala mo ba nakalaya ka na? Na lahat ng nalalaman mo'y sapat na? Hindi, kaibigan, marami ka pang madadaanan Upang lubusan mong masabing nagtagumpay ka na nga.  Sa iyong pagtatapos, akala mo ba'y nakaraos ka na? Tapos na ang napakaraming problema Hindi, kaibigan, magsisimula pa lamang Ang pagdating ng mas mabibigat na suliranin.  Sa naranasan mong hirap, sumusuko ka na? Magpakatatag ka, pagkat di mo alintana Na ang mas mahirap, padating pa lamang Sa bagong mundong iyong gagalawan.  Sa mundong ito, Lubusan kang matututo Mga pasikot-sikot ng buhay Tiyak malalaman mo.  Sa mga pagsubok, huwag kang sumuko Matinik man ang daan, pilitin mo Kung mabato ang landas, kayanin mo At di magtatagal, tagumpay ay mapapasaiyo.   Mahal Ba Kita?   (1994)   Akala ko noon, sa buhay ng tao'y pag-ibig ang lahat-lahat Subalit natanto na lamang, kaylaki palang pagkakamali ko Kailanma'y di inakalang isang araw, tayo'y magtatagpo Ngayo'y di makapaniwalang ikaw nga'y totoo.  Sa tanang buhay ko, ikaw lamang ang idinambana sa puso Sa bawat bigkas ko, katagang lumalabas ay yaring pangalan mo Di ko mawari kung ano at bakit nagkaganito Kung nagbago na nga ba ang pagtingin ko sa yo.  Noon, makita ka lamang ay sapat na sa akin Laking ligaya, ang dulot sa damdamin Subalit nang aking makamtan kaytagal na inasam Nanlamig at nagsawa nga ba ang abang pag-ibig ko sa yo?  Pag-ibig nga ba ito? Sa tuwina'y tanong ko Mahal nga ba kita? Baka naman puso ko'y nagkamali lamang?  Kapagdaka'y naitatanong, mga pagkakaiba Noo’y tanggap kita maging ika'y di pa kilala Subalit ngayong batid ko na'ng lahat Di ko maubos isipin kung ano ang gagawin.  Pag-ibig, sadyang kay hiwaga nito Nalilito na'ng husto yaring aking puso Naghihirap ng labis ang loob ko Sa tingin mo ba, ikaw nga'y mahal ko?  Nalilito ako... ayokong mawala ka sa 'kin Ngunit ayokong ika'y lokohin at gamitin Upang magkaroon lamang ng katuwang Subalit ayoko namang patuloy na masaktan.  Mahal nga ba kita? Anong nararapat kong gawin? Ano ang dapat kong sabihin? Kung matuklasan ko mang paghanga lamang pala't di ang pag-ibig na naturingan.    Mga Hinagpis ni Ason   (1999)   Sa pagmumuni-muni ako ay sawa na Sa pag-iisa, ako'y nababato na Kailan ba ako matututong magparaya? Kailan kaya ako tuluyang lalaya Sa loob nitong seldang ako rin ang lumikha?  Kung ang mga suliranin ko'y aking bibilangin Di kakasya kung daliri ang gagamitin Ano mang gawin ko, lutasin ko mang pilit  Pang-unawa ko'y sadyang makitid Di ko lubos maisip kung bakit Nandiyan naman si Nena, ba't di pa siya? O di kaya'y si Kiko, ba't ako pa?  Di lamang miminsan akong nagtangka Mainam pa ako'y magbigti na lamang kaya? Subalit masakit yun, labas pa ang aking dila Kung anu-anong naiisip ko, puro naman masama Sa seldang ito nais ko na talagang makalaya.  Kung ako'y marunong nang magmahal at magbigay Kung sa bawat gawin ko'y wala nang panghihinayang Kapag sa mga salita ko, maging sarili ko'y naniniwala Kapag ang mga kilos ko'y di na kaduda-duda At ang nararamdaman ko'y batid na ng iba Kung lahat ng problema ko'y sa Diyos na lang ipababahala Sa pagkakataong yon, siguradong ako'y wala na sa selda.    Paano Ba ang Lumimot?   (1994)   Mula nang mahalin kita Nalimutan ko na Ang salitang 'limutin ka' Basta't ang alam ko'y 'mahal kita'.  Ang sabi nila, ika'y di para sa akingAko ma'y di para sa 'yo rin Sabi nga nila, ang nagmamahal Nagiging bulag, pipi at bingi.  Ano'ng magagawa ko Di ko kaya ang lumimot? Kahit ano'ng gawin ko Ikaw ang aking naiisip.  Ilang ulit na nga ba? Ako'y nabigo at lumuha Ngayon ika'y aalis na Paano na ako nang nag-iisa?  Palalayain kita, pagkat mahal kita Subalit pakatatandaan mo itong sasabihin ko Mawala ka man o ako dito sa mundo Hinding-hindi ko magagawa ang limutin ka.

      It's a slack Thursday at work and i've spent most of my time placing some add ons in here. I've been wanting to create my own site for ages and at least now although i still dont know how to make myself one, i'm trying to familiarize my so so mind on how the html codes work. It's still a whole lot of work and my eyes are starting to bulge and shut lolz. It's not that i want people to see this stuff coz it's really a very personal thing for me but i just want to have something that will always remind me of things, people and emotions that overwhelmed me in the past and still have this great effect on me.  I had a short talk with Paul hours ago, he's busy writing another masterpiece for the Who's Who in Poetry and i just feel so so proud and happy for my man. It's gonna be one amazing and valuable gift for his mom. I didn't remind him about the pics nor the cam he promised coz i know he still have more important things to attend to. Anyway, i'm sure he's still as gorgeous as always. I was again inches above the ground when he told me he's really serious about me and that's a fact and that he believes in me 110%...and even more oh geeze.... do i have to say more. I'm giving him the time he needs and like in 2 weeks time he said we can start planning. Whatever. I'm not pressuring him coz i know that wont do us any good. What difference will it make? None. So i just have to understand and support him the only way i can for now... and that is by giving him time. He knows i'm just here and whatever mood i may get into, whether i'll start being impatient and rambling my pain out again tomorrow, only one thing is certain. I love him. Period. There are still a lot of things i want to do. Mostly for my family and my big dream of doing charity works someday. But if I were given a chance to make just one wish right now, it would be to open my eyes and find my Paul next to me.

       The Virgin August 23 to September 23     Virgo  is the only zodiacal sign represented by a female. It is sometimes thought of as a potentially creative girl, delicately lovely; sometimes as a somewhat older woman, intelligent but rather pedantic and spinsterish. The latter impression is sometimes confirmed by the Virgoan preciseness, refinement, fastidious love of cleanliness, hygiene and good order, conventionality and aristocratic attitude of reserve.They are usually observant, shrewd, critically inclined, judicious, patient, practical supporters of the status quo, and tend toward conservatism in all departments of life. On the surface they are emotionally cold, and sometimes this goes deeper, for their habit of suppressing their natural kindness may in the end cause it to atrophy, with the result that they shrink from committing themselves to friendship, make few relationships, and those they do make they are careful to keep superficial.But the outward lack of feeling may, in some individuals born under this sign, conceal too much emotion, to which they are afraid of giving way because they do not trust others, nor do they have confidence in themselves and their judgments. This is because they are conscious of certain shortcomings in themselves of worldliness, of practicality, of sophistication and of outgoingness. So they bring the art of self concealment to a high pitch, hiding their apprehensiveness about themselves and their often considerable sympathy with other people under a mantle of matter-of-factness and undemonstrative, quiet reserve.  They are still waters that run deep.  Yet in their unassuming, outwardly cheerful and agreeable fashion, they can be sensible, discreet, well spoken, wise and witty, with a good understanding of other people's problems which they can tackle with a practicality not always evident in their own personal relationships.In marriage they can be genuinely affectionate, making good spouses and parents. They are intellectually enquiring, methodical and logical, studious and teachable. They combine mental ingenuity with the ability to produce a clear analysis of the most complicated problems. They have an excellent eye for detail but they may be so meticulous that they neglect larger issues. Also, although they are realists, they may slow down projects by being too exact. Thoroughness, hard work and conscientiousness are their hallmarks, and they are such perfectionists that, if things go wrong, they are easily discouraged. Because of their ability to see every angle of a many-sided question, they are unhappy with abstract theorizing. With these qualities, they are better as subordinates than leaders. Responsibility irks them and they often lack the breadth of strategic vision that a leader needs. Their minds are such that they need the stimulus of practical problems to be solved rather than the mere routine or working to set specifications that need no thought. They are careful with money and their interest in statistics makes them excellent bookkeepers and accountants. Female Virgoans may find a career in fashion, for they have a flair for dress, in which they can be trendsetters.                        The sixth sign of the zodiac is concerned with:  * self-perfection, critical faculties * altruism, honesty, responsibility * cleanliness, hygiene, health, healing * efficiency, daily routines, reliability * strength of character, veiled sensuality * service, hard work, passivity, modesty * incisive communication, shrewd logical thought   The Virgoan Personality  These are the general personality traits found in people who are typical of Virgo. An unhappy or frustrated Virgo may display some of the not-so-attractive traits.                    Positive                                         * Gentleness with helpless                 * Humane and helpful                 * Knowledgeable about good health                 * Witty and charming                 * Physically sensual                 * Painstaking                 * Emotionally warm                 * Sympathetic                 * Organized                 * Dedicated                    Negative                  * Scathing criticism of the lazy                 * Cranky and irritable                 * Dogmatic                 * Untidy                 * Tendency to be hypochondriac                 * Nervous and worried                 * Prudish                 * Eccentric                 * Undemonstrative                 * Overdemanding   Secret Virgo   Inside anyone who has strong Virgo influences is a person who worries too much about every personal imperfection and is never satisfied with his or her own standards. Virgo may appear to know it all and be a compulsive worker; both these behaviors hide a deep fear that he or she cannot be good enough for, say, the job or the partner. Virgos crave the opportunity to serve others and take charge of many apparently mundane matters that, collectively, are the bedrock of success. One of the least expected aspects of a Virgo personality is a strong, almost volcanic sexuality that can lie hidden and dormant for years until the right partner comes along.    Ruling Planet and Its Effect  Mercury rules the zodiac sign of Virgo, so anyone whose birthchart has a strong Virgo influence will have a good and quick mind. In astrology, Mercury is the planet of the mind and communication. Being more concerned with practicalities than ideas (Gemini, the ideas sign, is also ruled by Mercury), Virgo is usually interested in acquiring information and in communicating by writing. The other traditional ruler of Virgo is the mythological Vulcan, the lame god of thunder, who has a confident and brilliant mind.                                  The Virgoan Look    People who exhibit the physical characteristics distinctive of the sign of Virgo look neat and fastidious and have a pleasant, often quietly beautiful face. Many Virgos look like loners and are not usually noisy people.    Physical Appearance   * High forehead  * Cranium may seem too big in comparison with the face  * Eyelids are often veiled  * Nose is straight  * Jaw is broad   The Virgoan Female  If a woman behaves in a way that is distinctive of the personality associated with the zodiac sign of Virgo, she will have a tendency toward the characteristics listed below, providing there are no influences in her personal birthchart that are stronger than that of her Virgo sun sign.  * has a pointed chin and a face in repose * the eyes are often soft and very beautiful * the hair may be long or short but is normally impeccably groomed * the mouth and lips are well formed * is typically clean and very neatly dressed   Behavior and Personality Traits  * can analyze situations in detail * is devoted to her work, usually serving others in some way * is basically shy * has incredible strength of purpose * will pursue happiness wherever it leads * is pure of mind but not naive * thinks of herself as more orderly and efficient than other people * has a delightful, straightforward personality * does not express her feelings easily * can be soothing one moment and critical the next    Virgo and Love    To Virgo, love is not dramatic, emotional, or sentimental. A Virgo's love is devotion and will include love of family, friends, and those less fortunate than he or she. Virgo in love with another person will have many of the characteristics listed below.   Behavior When In Love  * looks for quality * is frightened by overt romance * may wait years for the right person * once in love, loves warmly and steadily * is devoted to the loved one * will rarely give cause for any jealousy * will do anything to avoid breaking up  Expectations  * devotion from the partner * a sense of decency * to be fussed over when feeling down * personal matters to be kept private * feelings to be handled with great care   The End of An Affair   Virgos are typically loyal and will avoid ending a marriage or other permanent relationship whenever possible. However, in the long run, Virgos are sensible, practical people. If the Virgoan sense of fair play has been outraged, the Virgo will make a quick and final break, legally and in every other way.It is rare for a typical Virgo to linger in a fading marriage. If sensible, intelligent discussion does not solve the problems, the Virgo soon makes up his or her mind to end it.  Reconciliation is not typical of Virgoan behavior. Pleading, tears, sentimentality, or a more aggressive approach will have no effect. Because the Virgoan has good self-discipline, the past is soon put aside. However, if children are involved, the divorced Virgo will want to ensure that the children receive good education.    Virgo and Sex  When a typical Virgo makes love it is a pure-minded, natural, healthy act. Virgo only enjoys sex when it is with someone who has gained Virgo's confidence. Celibacy, for short or long periods, is not usually difficult for Virgo. In general, Virgoan's are looking for a spouse, not a one-night stand or an affair. A Virgo who has not had his or her fragile sense of self undermined in youth will enjoy sex. The bedside library may include informative books on sex, because Virgos like to understand the finer details. Virgo (male or female) tends to seduce with finesse, charm, and subtlety. The fact that typical Virgoan instincts are chaste does not mean that Virgos are virgins. The Virgin of astrology is a symbol of self- improvement and fertility.    Virgo and Partner  The person who contemplates becoming the marriage or business partner of a typical Virgo must realize that Virgo will regard the union as permanent, although the finer details can be flexible. Given this, the person who partners Virgo can expect absolute loyalty. Virgos make strong commitments because they combine duty with devotion. The Virgo will approach a proposal with great caution and will analyze the pros and cons throughly before getting involved. This is an excellent approach to any long-term partnership but may sound rather cold and clinical in the case of a proposed marriage.    Virgo Woman As A Partner  She is shy but as tough as nails when the need arises. In business, she will be cool, intelligent, and fully commited. Slow to love, Virgo woman is not interested in anything less than true love. When it happens, she will love intensely. She will only break a partnership if there has been hypocrisy. She is the most practical romantic in the zodiac.    Virgo and Friends  In general, Virgo likes a friend who is tidy, clean, and intelligent with a broad range of interests.They prefer people who are not given to big shows of emotion and are attracted to those who offer a sense of peace and serenity.    Positive Factors  Virgos love any pagentry that gives them an outlet for their tightly controlled emotions. Hence they are delightful companions at these events. Virgos are discriminating and have a fine artistic taste and a wealth of information on many subjects.They are not coarse and do not waste money. Virgos are loyal to their friends and will be extremely kind, considerate, and helpful.    Negative Factors  Virgos are nervous worriers, and a friend who in some way feeds the worries will reduce Virgo to a nervous heap. Virgos can be cold and critical, so a friend who softens the barbed remarks with caring laughter will bring out the Virgo wit.

      I was supposed to go to Makati yesterday to file my medicine reimbursement (as far as my planner's concerned) but geeze, the continuous rains have kept me from doing so. What i did was cross it out and reschedule it for tomorrow or friday(hopefully). I need to file it the soonest possible coz i'm sure the check processing will again take ages and i might need to beef up my savings soon for something important. Dunno when Paul's gonna start looking into the papers for the visa application but once he's done with it and sends me (which will take 3-4 days) i want to be as prepared as i can be. It's what i've been waiting for all these months and i dont wanna keep the wait any much longer. IT SUCKS! It really does. Another birthday celebrant in the family... so Jan juz turned 20... and i'm about to turn 27 in exactly 16 days. Really funny when i look back 10yrs ago and never had a clue what i'd be in 10 years time. Oh well, almost everything still is the same. No change in height. Gained a kilogram or two. Same color. Long straight hair again (yeah i remember when i had it permed right after HS graduation just to look a bit different). Have some pocketbells i used to call baby fats...hehe thanks to Lucy and Gracia who introduced me to the new coined term lol. Poorer vision from having to work on the computer for hours every day (Thank God for weekends). Still a size 81/2. Has moved thrice. Still living with the whole family. But i guess the biggest and most important twist in my life is that finally after 10 crucial years of being single, i've finally met "The One". Now when I look back on the 10 years that passed me unnoticed, i dont feel any bitterness at all... nor any slight regret. I've lived it well and it seems that every single day of those 10 years led me to Him. I just feel so thankful. Being happy and in love are the most amazing feelings on earth!!!    Good things come to those who wait   I'm living with this thought right now. I believe that we'll be together sooner or later... but it's certain, we will be. If we were able to wait for years just to know each other and fall in love, we can overcome another period of waiting to be together. Being together won't make ours a fairy tale story but it will mark the start of yet another journey... but this time, we'll be alone no more in battling whatever's ahead of us. It will always be the TWO of us... in everything. Forever it shall be.

      Had a good cry last night and when i woke up, i'm not as messed up as i was yesterday *sigh* i think i really needed that release.  Was just in time to catch Paul before he went off to sleep and managed a quick goodnite talk. He was sending me off messages when i got on, said he waited on me and really felt sleepy, has even fallen asleep there. Still no pics of him in my inbox :( felt sad but i believed him when he said that he wasnt able to sort coz he had a busier day than he expected. He told me to remind him though...sometimes i hate myself for being so makulit, i dont wanna sound like i'm nagging him or something to that effect, i just wanted more pics of him coz i really am missing him so bad. Sometimes i'd just click on his yahoo profile in the middle of a busy day just to look at his pic. He sent me the same pic a year ago, the first pic of him i've seen actually but i have it saved in the puter at home, printed a copy i keep on my notebook's first page which i always carry in my bag (dont keep a wallet lol). His profile is the most accessible lol. When i dropped by the shrine on my way to work, i again asked God for strength...strength for both of us. To continuosly believe that we will eventually make it. To keep on trusting each other. To be able to dwell on our love's growth instead of the weeds that surround us and trying to get in between. To overcome the distance and the pain it's causing us. I don't know for how long this has to go on but i believe this will come to end sooner or later. For now i'm leaving everything up to God's discretion. Everything will fall on the right places in His time. I love him and i believe Him when he says he do love me. It's all that matters right now... and i'm here hanging on.

      Okay okay, i know it's Monday.....i'm supposed to start my day right to have a really great week. But can i just tell myself this when i do feel really down right now? Argh!!..wish i could. I'm just too confused, too many things are running through my head. My emotions are very very mixed up. I should be happy having talked with Paul today. I am. But there's something that's really bothering me... and i hate it when i start to feel this way. I've tried so hard to always focus on the positive side of things that maybe, maybe i somehow overlooked the facts. Or maybe i've seen them and thought that the best way to deal with them is to shrug them off and play blind and insensitive...i dont know! I hate myself for being too dumb everytime my heart gets hit. I always end up handling things the best i could even if sometimes it already sucks. The sad part is that i always have a way of keeping all these to myself thus, leaving me more shattered in the end. We've never had a single fight in our 8-month relationship and i dont intend to pick on him just to start one. But i cant help but think, "am i really holding on something/someone real?"..... "is it worth it?".....I dont know. But deep within me, my heart says YES in caps. I cant see his efforts into the relationship well enough but i do know that just talking to me for a bit is already considered an effort if you think of the time zone involved. He's always working or away.... sometimes i just long too much for his time. But again i tell myself he'll give if only he got loads of it. I try to understand him in every way i can. Whenever he leaves me hanging, i'd always assume that maybe he has fallen asleep coz it's already too late out there. Sometimes i cant help but wonder why he has to work on hours like that when he's supposed to be sleeping. Maybe that's just the way it is, we all make use of our time the way we want. I've never had doubts, i've never seen any reasons to doubt in the first place. Or have i? Whenever we talk he would always tell me he loves me. He's always good with words and my heart couldnt help but melt.... i'm only bothered that he doesnt act his words out. He would always tell me soon, soon, soon.......but how soon is SOON? When is that soon gonna be? I believe him, everything he says....if that makes me dumb and crazy then let it be. I love him, God knows how much.....I always do my best to understand him but how much can i take? For how long? Every day i pray for strength. I know God must have valid reasons for all these things. Maybe he's just testing my patience and persistence. Or maybe he's just waiting for me to realize where i really stand and pick myself up from there. Right now i still dont know. I chose to hold on the love i have, to the man i've given my heart to.... until i find a reason to let go.

      Oh well .......i'm a newbie here. Been missing jotting down on my diary for a while now and i suddenly thought maybe i could get myself an online journal this time.  So here it is, at last i've created one though it looks really empty....as in empty. Today is my brother Papi's big day. Cant think of anything to bring home later. Argh! Might just decide on something when i get off from work. A cake might do hehehe I just had a really wonderful day. I talked with my darling for hours this time.....not just minutes but take note : hourS.....he's been working on something and i'm glad he still had time to talk to me. I just hope he was able to sleep coz i feel a bit guilty everytime i get carried away talking to him knowing that he should be off sleeping that time and there i was keeping him up. Anyway, i'll be missing my Paul over the weekend :(  I wish yahoo will stop acting up so i can get online on my mobile. I just keep missing him more every day **sigh**
