      I'm very, very tired.&nbsp; In fact my whole life I've been tired.&nbsp; I never drank coffee until I was eighteen, actually I think that's when the whole tired thing started.  Had a job interview for a school of performing arts, and I sweated.&nbsp; Despite all my best preparations, the ready handkerchief, etc.&nbsp; My face poured gallons and I said, "sorry to distract you by sweating."&nbsp; I'm a sweaty girl, always have been, and there is no way around it.&nbsp; I wouldn't care if it was under my arms, or even my back, which it is incidentally, but it's my face and I end up looking psychotic, neurotic...  If I don't get hired I'm blaming it on the sweating.  I'm a little bored too. Too much media to consume. Books, DVD's, videos television, didgital photos read a book called Lustmord: Sexual Murder in Weimar Germany-just my thing, otto dix George Grosz I bet they didn't get bored. I'm soft. I'd be dead if I lived in a country with even the littlest amount of hardship, at least for this soft bourgeois girl like me. I'm still fantasizing about joining some international conspiracy to undermine global capitalism&nbsp; but I don't... wherever it is. Because I'm soft, I lay in bed, read my literary and art criticism, eat rice cakes so I don't gain weight since I've stopped smoking (almost three weeks) and gorge on media. Oh the list, so then it's other people's blogs, online newspapers, software for photo editing, Then the machines. the washer for the cat piss that the Archie and Dirk Kray (my cats) have created. and the vacuum I was really proud of when I bought because it vacuums hard wood floors, and the telephone which I hate, and the fan that I suspet is giving me chronic fatigue syndrome, and I would be a neo luddite if I could, but I cannot. So I'm bored and tired. But I have coffee to perk me up, a capitalist tool, to get me motivated to e-mail yet more resumes for the opportunity to sweat in somebody else's office.

      I am thinking of starting a postcard business, at least&nbsp;I was before I fell asleep&nbsp;during my afternoon nap.  I'm a little obsessed with getting comments.&nbsp; Why do some people get them, and I'm sure I'm asking it for it with that comment, and others don't?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I've been thinking of&nbsp;how I categorize blogs, and what I like to read about.&nbsp;  I can't lure someone to their doom because that goes against my moral principles, but maybe I could lure someone to my blog by using one or more of the following tactics:  1. rant (which would be boring) 2. have some kind of affliction, and be an exhibitionist about it. 3.  razzle-dazzle,  and  make it happen .&nbsp; My boyfriend worked on a spec commercial set&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; freelance this week and some Angeleno actually said, &nbsp;"make it happen."&nbsp; He said, "did you think it was a joke?" 4. hate someone and go on and on about it. 5. be obsessed with sex, and describe it in minute detail. 6. write travel observations.

      So quitting smoking seemed like a useful thing to do now that I am unemployed, although I have a tentative&nbsp;job interview of Wednesday at a "faith-based organization", so who knows.&nbsp; Won't put them down, it might be bad karma and I need the job. &nbsp; Since Bush has come into office faith-based is sexy.&nbsp; Imagine...I can't quite picture my Sunday school teacher from third grade as sexy. &nbsp; So it's day 5 off of cigarettes, I've been smoking for 18 yrs, minus the&nbsp;11 months I quit once before.&nbsp; Not that anyone really cares, my life is interesting to me, therefore my obsession with improving it. &nbsp; Rent the Salton Sea with Val Kilmer and then visit the place.&nbsp; Will write more later, but picture&nbsp;a half desecrated trailer park that strongly smells of fish, grinning locals in 111 degree heat, brackish water filled with fertilizer, men with huge tattoos hanging out in the public restrooms.&nbsp; It was beautiful.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I was incredibly embarrassed to hear someone on the news in L.A., a tourist, say that Los Angeles was great because you could go to the beach, mountains, and the "Inland Empire" all in one day.  That's what I said one year and a month ago when I moved here from "civilized" NYC.  Obviously that person doesn't ride the bus, and if NYC was a country I'd emigrate.    Other bloggers have a handle on the state on transportation in the 21st Century so I won't bother.  L.A. is hot, hot, hot, and not like the Buster Poindexter song.  I sweat like a pig, and look like a meth addict, even though I'm not, thank G-d!  I've started walking not to look like the jiggling fatties who stand in a stupor in the 100 something shade and wait for the bus which comes when it damn well pleases.  I'm sure I won't get a job at Citibank, buyt at this point with the unemployment checks rolling in for a year, maybe I won't need to.

      For New Yorkers who are missing home, and are overwhelmed by the size of L.A. here's a tip.  Walk aroung Downtown Los Angeles for an hour, and you'll feel as though you're on Canal Street on a muggy afternoon where all you want to do is escape the smell of piss, unabashed drug dealers and people who just don't give a fuck.  Make sure while you're eyeing bootleg copies of Spiderman spread out on sheets on the sidewalk that you walk on over to Clifford's Cafeteria.    Apparently there was one in Burbank, or was it Century City?  Anyway, it's like being in Times Sq. in the 70's.  I wasn't in Times Sq. in the Seventies, but I've seen lots of pictures, and it looks like it.    Clifford's is multi-levelled and has a grotto, like Forest Lawn, with a picture of a saint that you can contemplate while digesting your cheesecake, guacamole, fruit salad, french bread roll stuffed with cheese and jalapenos, salady meal.  Which is what I had because Angelenos, good Angelenos like their food.  The best part: No hipsters with laptops drinking Starbucks.

       Not all un-black folks think of us as muggers....they also think of us as just rappers and basketball players. (You're suppose to smile its a sarcastic joke)   Thank you Ramona.  But I'm sick of rednecks, faux liberals, apoplectic survivors of WW2, and being lumped into some monolithic category known as Black.  Maybe years of "good schools" honed my bullshit detector.  In fact...well that doesn't really matter.  Glendale, CA.   Home of Forest Lawn Mortuary Park with its movable Last Supper installation and the Verdugo Jobs Center.  I am a "job seeker" so I have to show up at the Job Center.   There are a lot of unemployed people in So. Cal., but at least I'm alive enough to visit the cemetery.   urlLink

      It's nice that Black people like me get thanked occassionally.  Quote from a usually boring rundown of gallery shows in NYC:   and I felt a little conspicuous being so white and all, but I shouldn't have let that bother me, as black people have been so good in me in my life, saved my ass more than once.   I'd like to know how we have been "good in him and his life."  Have we patiently listened to his endless self-doubt chattering, and monologues of self-pity?  I do appreciate it though, usually un-black people think of us just as muggers.  How nice of him to take up our cause.

      Sleep has never been my problem.  I will not sleep all day, I will not.  Every day there's sunshine in L.A., I will take advantage of it, I will.  I probably won't, I'm typing this, but I'll try.  In L.A. you don't feel guilty about not going outside for long periods of time the way you do in NY.  There is no, I m ight miss the best weather of the year, that happens to fall on one lonely day in July.  Every day is beautiful, despite the car chases.

      What happened the last time was...well I'm not really sure.  Before the Walkathon I was a great employee.  My boss said thank you after a hard days work, and offered me strawberries she had brought from home.  After the Walkathon I was "aggressive, combatitive, highly intelligent, but unorganized."  Then it was lots of "lets close the doors, I want to tell you something," and hushed conferences.  Not to mention the young Texan she hired with a law degree.    "But the job skill sets are identical," I said.  no wonder I got fired, skill sets?!  "There's enough work to go around, don't worry I want to keep you," she said in her overweight-downside of 40, been divorced twice, 4ft. something voice.  I commute two hours a day to work to a remote corporate park where there are:   1. hardly any sidewalks. 2. nothing but malls 3. bigheaded Angelenos driving at murderous speeds 4. and way to many arts and crafts stores  and I have to put up with this $@!!8, for $920.00 every two weeks?

      I was fired exactly one and 1/2 months ago.  Since I moved to Los Angeles I've had three jobs, been fired twice and quit once.  I'm not looking for sympathy, just thought I'd let you know what it's like.

      My boyfriend is a hardworker. And he wants to visit the Spiral Jetty. But we went to the Salton Sea, which was my idea, but it was 111 degrees. I don't want to see mormons in Utah, village of the damned children everywhere, and sweat. I didn't get the job, I knew i wouldn't, its the fucking sweat. Heard a n ad on the radio that boasts the elimination of sweaty palm syndrome. in L.A. you can have your vagina sculpted, the sweat removed from your palms, boccilism injected into your face, etc. etc. Anyway, I want to go to Seattle.  I've only seen rain twice this past year, okay maybe three times, and I miss it. So Seattle it will be despite Bob's hard work. Good books, although one day I will compile a list of all good books that despite being "good" manage to take a swipe at Black people like me. What to say... Steppenwolf, Herman Hesse, apparently, "everyone was reading that in the Seventies," except for me because it was the decade of my birth.

      I don't know what's wrong with me I have this crazy insomnia, every hour I get up and eat humus thinking it'll put me to sleep and then I have these nightmares where I'm naked well, whatever or I'm missing everything on my body but my shirt, I hate retold dreams anyway I can't sleep and I'm utterly exhausted. I think it's the nicorette gum is it possible? Anyway so there are these fuckin kids, one screamed for an hour straight, that's weird maybe I should've called child services or something I hate loud people really can't stand them maybe they don't have their heads stuck up their asses like me but fuck why do I want to know anything about them there likes or disliikes, etc. much less there fuckin' voice. A little jealous, Bob is in NYC, on his way to watch a movie at Film Forum to watch a movie about L.A., where I am because since I'm unemployed although he wanted me to I couldn't afford to go home. But L.A. is my home now.  It's also the home of: The John Wayne Cancer Inst. (I'm sure they do marvelous work) The Ronald Reagan Library Staples Center and I'm too tired to think of other examples of consumerism and celebrity passing for cultural identity. Have fun Bob at least we don't have kids.
