       I was at the zoo this weekend to do my normal exhibit interpreting (talking to bratty kids about how cheetahs have spots, etc.) and some really cool stuff happened, namely that we bred two young cats together and may have cubs in November.  There was a lot of activity all day with Amadi (the male cat) stuttering and yelping all afternoon, which is basically him saying "I'd like to get laid again, get over here you bitch!"  For those of you who don't know, cheetahs are the only large cat that does not roar, but they have a whole slew of other cool noises.      I also got to see Jomu, one of our older females, charge around the yard growling while the keepers tried to get her to go inside.  Needless to say, Jomu won and got to stay in her yard.        Since I am a moron, as previously stated, who also can't put up links to photos, I made a little album on Shutterfly so you can see some pics I took of our cats and our Grevy's zebras (which are a HIGHLY endangered species, btw - only about 3000 left in the wild).   You can see them by clicking on the link below.  There are also pics of some of our other animals, including a few I took of the pandas.

       I had all of this good stuff to share this weekend, but never got online and now I don't remember.      Can anyone tell me how to make text a hyperlink?  I am a moron.

      Does anyone remember him?  I had a dream about him last night.  The dream itself was pretty transparent, but it still felt so real that I woke up sad that it had ended.

       I know I'm way past my blogging limit for the day (3 entries now), but I finally found my lipstick yesterday.  I've been searching all over the place for the color I like and haven't been able to find it (Revlon Colorstay's Fig if you're interested).  Well lo and behold, they have it at Shoppers Food Warehouse, about 5 minutes from where I work.  I might be pissed except I am so overjoyed to have found it that I can't be.

       the time that my friends and I got together at my apt.  for some pre-drinking, then headed out to catch the Metro into the city so we could go dancing.  On the way, I had to pee so we stopped in the CVS.  After begging the manager to let me use their bathroom (and using it), I remembered that I had forgotten to put on deodorant.  I prompty used some, then put it back on the shelf, then sprayed myself down with some imitation CK1.  Good times!

       now there's this:  ...Before attending a rally to hear Vice President Dick Cheney, citizens in New Mexico were required to sign a political loyalty oath approved by the Republican National Committee. "I, (full name) ... do herby (sic) endorse George W. Bush for reelection of the United States." The form noted: "In signing the above endorsement you are consenting to use and release of your name by Bush-Cheney as an endorser of President Bush."  Around the country, Bush is campaigning at events billed as "Ask President Bush." Only supporters are allowed entrance. Talking points are distributed to questioners...  -from salon.com's Sidney Blumenthal in his column "Isn't this a Democracy?" (  urlLink  http://www.salon.com/opinion/blumenthal /2004/08/19/ask_bush/index.html   )  Why aren't more people, even Bush supporters, more alarmed by things like this? Since when did it become acceptable to keep the president from hearing ANY disagreement with his policies from the citizens he's supposed to serve?

        So I just signed up for this so I could respond to Dan's posts, but then I thought instead of boring my friends by making them listen to the minutia of my life, I would make them read it here instead.So let's see...since that usually involves dogs, it's only appropriate to start with a dog story. Last night I got home to discover that my foster had shit in his crate. I was up until 2 am taking him outside while he vomited/crapped and cleaning up his crate/doing laundry. Now I have to leave work at 2:30 to take him to the vet. Enjoy!
