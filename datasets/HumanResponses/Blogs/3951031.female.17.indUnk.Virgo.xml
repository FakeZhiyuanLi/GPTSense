       today was okay.&nbsp; warm up was fun.&nbsp; i felt really energetic and streached.&nbsp; rehearsal went well and we started blocking our scene from "the cherry orchard".&nbsp; i really have to work on being a serious person.&nbsp; it is really hard.&nbsp; lunch was early today and then we had voice class.&nbsp; hal (the instructor) did a good job helping us all relax.&nbsp; tthe audition class was informative, but kind of boring.&nbsp; hopefully tomorrow will be good classes.&nbsp; at lunch, all of us were talking, and are thinking about going tubing on saturday after class is over.&nbsp; that would be fun.&nbsp;

      today, we got our roles for the final production.&nbsp; my character is serious and sort of shy, which is completely opposite of who i am.&nbsp; but this is theatre, so i am no longer becky, but varya in "the cherry orchard".&nbsp; not living around here has its obstacles, like not being able to go home and go through my wardrobe for rehearsal clothes and shoes, but it's like something i learned yesterday- how do i get it anyway?- so i will have to work something out.

       so today was our first day of class.&nbsp; we spent the morning getting to know each other and playing trust games.&nbsp; the other kids are really easy to get along with, and i'm sure it will be hard in two weeks when we finish.&nbsp; the instructors and interns are really nice, and already i can't wait for class to start again tomorrow.&nbsp; i thought spending 6 hours here would be long, but it went by really fast.&nbsp; i'm really beginning to open up and trust people early on.&nbsp; one of the activities was writing our fears on a piece of paper, and ripping it and throwing it away.&nbsp; i felt good after that, like i am more likely to do the opposite of my fear.&nbsp; i'm still scared about some things, but hopefully, i can get over my fears and be open to anything that might happen.&nbsp; it was a good first day, and i am looking forward to the next two weeks.&nbsp;
