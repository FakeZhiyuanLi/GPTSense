						   Its a lovely summers day and im sat in the easy internet cafe as it's air conditioned. mmmmmm! Nice. I havent done much since my last post but would like to again show my complete agreement with others opinions about the rifts in cell.  NOw what have i been up 2? Well yesterday it pissed it down ALL day in royton so, i sat on my sofa with my duvet watchin crap telly and it made me wonder..... Why is  99% of the music being released lately SHITE. i mean it really is its all, shitty emo and crap pop punk and metal doesnt even seem to exist on music television i'd complain but what the point, i've got my cds. So my deepest comiserations for those who regularly watch music tv, you poor poor fools!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  any way 'nuff of the rant. till next time boys and girls................
