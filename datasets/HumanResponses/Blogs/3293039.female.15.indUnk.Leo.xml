      Yeah so I'm grounded this weekend for not turning in algebra homeworks, oh well...i'll live, plus i got some MUCH NEEDED spring cleaning in,i actually have a floor! can u believe it! i'm so excited! yeah so the yankees lost today, it was horrible we were tied with seattle through the top of the 13th inning, and thats when we screwed up...ok so we intentionally walked two batters to load the bases so that there would be a force out at all of them...normally this is a good idea, but probably not when ur playin for game points...so seattle ended up going through their entire lineup and almost doubling their score in just ONE INNING...however, derek jeter did get on base! but then williams struck out swinging..and thats how the game went...but on a better note, the ballet was absolutely beautiful last night and i loved it! I cant wait to marry some rich guy that can donate a lot to the ballet so we can get great seats! yeah when i get older and guys learn to appreciate ballet, thats where they need to take me...hint hint(tell sam) haha actually i already told him he had to take me sometime...ah, hes the best ever..i really hope i dont kill this one, haha yeah i'm watchin law & order SVU...i love this show! its amazing...i cant wait to be a lawyer..since i like kids so much i was thinkin about goin into child law like divorce placement cases and stuff like that, the episode im watchin now is about a boy that was murdered and he was and illegal alien from Africa and bought by this guy who used him as a sex slave while his wife was gone..gross right? but yall should really watch the show, its good... yeah well i don't have much more to say.. i get to go to the mall with allee! so im not TOO grounded but i mean honestly ur either grounded or ur not its not like well ur only grouded a little bit..kinda weird if u ask me.. but yeah im goin shoppin for skirts..yeah this week is katherines bday yall so dont forget to get her somethin on wednesday..yeah thats right i learned how to spell it! haha well i'll catch yall cats lata

      have you ever noticed how people can be so mean? and not just to you i mean havent u ever caught urself and sayd wow im such a jerk? and how its so hard not to hold grudges...i mean u know its wrong but somehow its just so hard to forgive and forget? and how you would just love to press the rewind button of life sometimes?  but i think theres no rewind button for a reason...we have to make mistakes and learn  how to avoid that in the future, and if we dont avoid it again, we have another screw up to remind us, and we're just gonna do it over and over again till we get it right, which can ultimately hurt you if u dont do it right the first time... sometimes life lessons are so hard and they hurt so much...it ultimately comes down to self control i think...possibly that you lack some...thats just my opinion if you want it..just that we wanna be nice sometimes but we dont have enough self control not to argue back...and we're such hpocritical beings, have you ever noticed that? i think its so much easier to see the flaws in other people than ourselfs because we're so stuck on us...and doesnt that thought just make you sick? that we're so high and mighty on ourselves that we cant see the problems that we have? and we dont have enough self control to change the flaws that we do see? we're just incredibly sick creatures..i mean which brings me to the point of why on earth would God have chosen US to do his work? it baffles my mind to wonder why in the world he would put me here and what kind of purpose he could have for someone liek me whos totally spoiled and has no self control to change herself for the better, what use could i possibly be to him?...chew on that thought for a while..
