       Welcome to Get That Job!   This is the initial post for this weblog.  I am soliciting contributors in order to make it a more collaborative effort, very similar to  urlLink The End of Free .  So... if you're interested please send me an email to danimal0416 AT yahoo.com  (I intentionally wrote it that way to prevent my email address from being automatically harvested, since this has happened to me in the past.  Additionally, I maintain a few or more  urlLink other blogs .  I know that may sound like a lot, but since this weblog is a collaborative effort, I won't need to spend much time on this... right?

       urlLink  From MSN Careers: Sizing Up A Potential Employer    "You finally found the right job. Or so you thought. Now that you have been on the scene for two weeks, you notice how people treat you. Your boss consistently calls meetings during lunchtime -- sans food. Yesterday, you received a proposal at 4:45 p.m. to type up by 9:00 a.m. the following day. And although the company is teeming with people burning the midnight oil, there is little joyful interaction among employees."  urlLink more...   I can't understate this enough myself.  You may feel desperate for a job, but why would you want to work for just a paycheck?  You're worth more than that.

       Panic Page!   At Careerbuilder.com, I found a Boss Button, i.e., a link to click so that something else will open in order for you to hide the fact that you're looking for another job when your boss is near.  I don't necessarily advocate this practice, but the content on the  urlLink Panic Page  was humorous.

       Job Outlook 2002: You'll Work Hard to Find a Job    urlLink JobWeb.com:   "The foosball tables are gone. You won't be offered a four-day work week. And that sweet little sports car you were prepared to accept as a signing bonus? You'll have to pay for this car the old fashioned way—with savings from your weekly paycheck.  "The job market for college graduates isn't as bright as it was this time last year (or over the past three years)—however, it's not as dismal as you might believe either."   urlLink continued...   I've seen this myself.  Four years ago, there were a lot more obvious opportunities than there are now.  I still believe that the jobs are out there, however.  Just because overall the job market may be a little soft, does not mean that today, tomorrow, next week, someone won't quit or retire or do something else that creates a job opening for what I am looking for.

       Wanted:   Your  Job Hunting Success Stories   That's right, gentle readers.  I want to let others know about how you have successfully found a job.  It may be your current one or a previous one - it doesn't matter.  I want to encourage other job seekers with your success.  You will receive no reimbursement from this, except for the gratification that your story has helped to inspire countless others who are where you once were.  Be specific, but don't mention any company names.  That may sound like a contradiction in terms, and you may disagree with this approach - let me know and I may reconsider.  Instead, use a generic title, such as "software development consulting company", "global consumer products company", and so on.  If you would like some help, then let me know.  I will only use your initials or first name and last initial when presenting your success story.  I am specifically interested in answers to the following:     What position were you applying for?  How did you contact the particular company?  Describe the interviewing process.  Did you work part-time or as a contractor/consultant with the company before being hired?  How long was the process from your first contact with the company to your first day of work?  Describe your emotional state during the process.  Were you anxious?  Excited?  Stressed?  Impatient?  Frustrated?  Let us know.    So email me your job hunting success stories at danimal0416 AT yahoo.com (replace the " AT " with the "@", of course), and we'll get these published here at "Get That Job!"

In the September 3, 2002 edition of  Employment Plus , a marketing publications supplement to the  urlLink Dayton Daily News , he has an article entitled, "Climb up the ladder starts with Day One at new job."  Some of the many highlights worth noting include     "The demands of the New Economy have employers bringing in employees who will make an immediate contribution."  "Resign yourself to arriving early and staying late.  No employer likes a clock watcher."  "Go out of your way to assist peers to show that you can be depended upon."  "You might consider finding out what your supervisor's favorite civic or charitable activities are and volunteer to work for those organizations."  "Calculated bragging means to pick your spot and be subtle when showing superiors specifically how you are doing."

       Information Overload   from  urlLink FranklinCovey  Weekly Quotes email    Talk about bulking up.  urlLink Pitney-Bowes , the maker of postage meters, did a study in 2000 that found the average U.S. office worker sends and receives 52 phone messages, 36 email messages, 36 pieces of regular mail, 14 faxes, and eight pager messages each day. All of this information can cause stress, memory problems, and difficulty maintaining one’s attention and ability to focus. So what do you do? Slim down and start the Information Overload diet! A few tips:    Overcome any reluctance you might have to throwing away files, paper and other things. The fear of discarding something that might be useful later-much, much later-holds back many of us from getting rid of stuff we’ll never use.   Develop good habits. For example, handle your paper work at the same time each day, look at what is in your in-box no more than twice a day, etc.   Find a planning system that works for you. Whether it’s a binder to carry your planning pages, wireless phone, and handheld, or software to keep all your information synched together, FranklinCovey offers hundreds of solutions to keep you organized and productive.    Information Overload - try the low-fat version!

       Job Hunting Success Story   Steve K., who works for the USAF, emailed me recently:   Hello all,  As some of you have known and some not, I put in for cross-training to a different career field...Into computers to be exact.  Well, I opened up my VMpf (Virtual Military Personnel Flight) and it said  APPROVED  I will start school in June and finish up in September.  From there I find out my assignment.    God does bless those who are faithful

       Decisions, Decisions    This post is reprinted from an email I get every week from the folks at  urlLink FranklinCovey .   You’ve been working intensely on a project for several hours and you feel your effectiveness dwindling. You have the thought that taking a break to read a little or eating an early lunch might regenerate you. But you have a deadline, and you’re not sure whether the break is really renewal or escape. How do you decide?  Ask with intent. This is an essential act to become principle-centered. Ask your conscience, not out of curiosity, but out of commitment to act on the wisdom of the heart. “What’s the best use of my time right now?” “What is life asking of me?” Listen without excuse. When you hear the first whispering of conscience, you’ll either act in harmony with it, or immediately begin to rationalize making another choice. Choosing the first option will bring you inner peace. Act with courage. Some of the greatest acts of courage are in that instant between stimulus and response in our everyday decisions in life. Effective decision-making - something to decide upon!

       Job Hunting Success Story   Gregg B. emailed me his job hunting success story:    Prayer actually worked for me.  I was looking for a job for 5-6 months I was going on a lot of interviews and nothing was happening...  And I was being prideful - not praying about it a lot or consitently... Then when one day I just begged and begged for God to get me a job loudly in prayer... A day later I got a call for an interview and by week's end I had the job... I was humbled by God's power.

       Wanted:   Your  Job Hunting Success Stories   That's right, gentle readers.  I want to let others know about how you have successfully found a job.  It may be your current one or a previous one - it doesn't matter.  I want to encourage other job seekers with your success.  You will receive no reimbursement from this, except for the gratification that your story has helped to inspire countless others who are where you once were.  Be specific, but don't mention any company names.  That may sound like a contradiction in terms, and you may disagree with this approach - let me know and I may reconsider.  Instead, use a generic title, such as "software development consulting company", "global consumer products company", and so on.  If you would like some help, then let me know.  I will only use your initials or first name and last initial when presenting your success story.  I am specifically interested in answers to the following:     What position were you applying for?  How did you contact the particular company?  Describe the interviewing process.  Did you work part-time or as a contractor/consultant with the company before being hired?  How long was the process from your first contact with the company to your first day of work?  Describe your emotional state during the process.  Were you anxious?  Excited?  Stressed?  Impatient?  Frustrated?  Let us know.    So email me your job hunting success stories at danimal0416 AT yahoo.com (replace the " AT " with the "@", of course), and we'll get these published here at "Get That Job!"

        urlLink ElectronicsWeb | How to Get Comfy Networking    Heather Stone writes a 'must-read' article on how to do better networking.  Here's a brief excerpt:    Mac Carter feels like a hero. As a HR administrator for a nationwide retailer, he has opportunities to serve people in a variety of capacities. But never has he felt better about helping someone than he does now.   Mac has a daughter in the Girl Scouts and while at a function with her, he met the father of one of the other kids. They got to talking over cookies and punch, and Mac learned the man was an unemployed distribution manager. Knowing that his company was in need of distribution management, Mac gave him the name and phone number of a department head that had hiring authority with his company. Within days the man called to express his gratitude, explaining their situation was fast becoming desperate. It made Mac feel good to know that he helped this man to find a job and helped his company to meet a need at the same time.  This scenario is illustrative of a typical networking success. It demonstrates the power of having contacts. The rule of "who you know" has long been a key job search component. Statistics have consistently shown that over 80 percent of jobs never get advertised because they are filled through the vague technique of "networking."

       Making Contacts   I'm learning that it's important to know people in order to get that job.  I've enjoyed going to career fairs and attending other functions that are geared toward meeting other people.  I want to be aware of other functions that come along, too.  There is also the benefit of meeting someone "cold" at the library, for example.  I met a young man who knows someone from a local Dayton company, and he gave me that person's information so that I can contact her.  But the great thing about networking is that it's a Win/Win situation.  I need to look for some way to help someone else in addition to my getting help.  To be honest, it's been difficult to keep that perspective when I'm eagerly looking for a job.  Even then, I need to keep in mind that someone will be hiring me because of skills that I can contribute to make them money.

       Job Hunting Success Story   I have a  urlLink job hunting success story  to share.  In September I attended a couple Job Fairs, one at the  urlLink Dayton Convention Center  and one at the  urlLink Dayton Job Center .  I cannot remember exactly which one it was, but I left my resume with the folks from  urlLink Manpower Professional .  This past Wednesday I received a phone call about an opportunity with Lexis Nexis, doing some Excel VBA work, for which it sounds like I'm aptly qualified.  I start working there   tomorrow  !  The assignment will last about one month, but hopefully I can extend my time there and use this opportunity as a springboard into something more permanent, especially once I see how things are going inside the company.  I keep getting emails stating that they have a number of open positions, and I even applied for a couple.  Now, let's hear some of   your    urlLink job hunting success stories !

       Effectiveness Tip of the Week   from a weekly email from the folks at  urlLink FranklinCovey :    Me, Myself, and I   It's time to get a little selfish and focus on you for a moment.  When was the last time you did something to make yourself feel good? (And we're not talking about that pint of Chocolate Dream ice cream.)  A few tips to treat yourself and your body:    Physical:   Get a good night's sleep, play your favorite outdoor sport or activity, and enjoy a well-balanced meal.   Social/Emotional:   Call a friend you haven't seen in a while, volunteer time to charity, or do something nice for someone--anonymously.   Mental:   Visit a library or museum, solve a brainteaser, puzzle or riddle, or watch an educational show on TV.   Spiritual:    Spend some time in nature, research your genealogy, or go on a personal "retreat" (like a spa) to rejuvenate yourself. Benefiting your mind and body - a solo act!

Some people think that a summary of the resume attached to the resume seems a little repetitive.  The purpose of your cover letter, then, is to add a warm handshake to your resume and zero in on why the employer should be interested in you.  Your cover letter should put your resume in context, drawing attention to your strengths and present nonresume material that can make a difference between you and your next closest competitor when the interviewing decision is made.

       Effectiveness Tip of the Week   from a weekly email I receive from the folks at  urlLink FranklinCovey     First... some relevant quotes, from  urlLink QuotesBlog  :  "Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. As you simplify your life, the laws of the universe will be simpler." --  urlLink Henry David Thoreau  "Awaken your sense, your intuition, your desires. Awaken the parts of yourself that have been sleeping. Life is a dream, and to live it, you must be awake." --  urlLink Rachel Snyder  "True life is lived when tiny changes occur." --  urlLink Leo Tolstoy     Mission Possible   Ever feel like a double agent, living one life and dreaming of another?  Be the leader of your life!  Sound impossible?  It's not, when you have a Personal Mission Statement.  Here are some clues:   Unique : It's different for everyone.  It can be a sentence, paragraph or poem.  Focus :  It's a clear guide based on your values -- what you want to be and do.  Ask yourself this question:  "What can I imagine myself doing if time and money were not obstacles?"  Passion :  It's what excites you most in the world and lifts you up on your soapbox. Take 5 minutes RIGHT NOW and write as much as you can about your personal mission in life.  It doesn't have to be perfect.  You can revise this first draft later.  Keep it in your planning device and read it morning and evening for the next week.  Decide what things you can do during the day to live your mission.  (Warning!  This message will "self-construct" in 5 minutes...)

       Job Posting Sites Elsewhere on the Internet   Dick Bolles, author of the perennial "What Color Is Your Parachute?",  urlLink writes : The Internet is larger than just the World Wide Web. Outside the Web, lie USENET newsgroups, mailing lists, and a number of other modalities or protocols, as they are called. Many employers find these protocols – especially newsgroups – more effective than the Web, when they're searching for employees, most particularly when they're searching for technical employees. So it is to newsgroups you must go, and not just to the Web, if you're interested in those employers' job listings.  There are newsgroup metasearch sites (on the Web, paradoxically) that will allow you to search a number of these newsgroups or a number of Mailing Lists all at once, rather than having to go to each newsgroup one by one.    urlLink Google Groups  has messages from several thousand newsgroups. If it's job listings you're looking for, just type in your query, like: jobs AND Bay Area and it will give you the actual job listings that match, in reverse order (most recent, first).  You can search within specific groups or search all groups.

       How You Got Here   I've been looking through the referrer logs, and I found out that this website is currently third in the list of the Yahoo! search results for " urlLink job search websites in dayton ohio ."  Another Yahoo! search for " urlLink challenger job hunting method " shows this blog as second in the list.  But it was 25th in the list of search results for " urlLink google job ."  I sure hope that the  urlLink Google Viewer  gains popularity.  With that tool, you get to preview the web pages in your search results.

       Job-hunting expenses are deductible   In MSN Money's article, " urlLink The top 10 overlooked deductions ," number 4 is "Let the IRS subsidize your job search." Job-hunting expenses are deductible. If you're out of work, or even if you're still employed but looking for a new job, all of your job hunting expenses are deductible as miscellaneous itemized deductions. Such expenses would include resumes, phone calls, postage, travel costs and any other expenses related to your attempt to get a new job. If you’ve done a lot of driving in your job search in 2002, you can deduct mileage for your 2002 return at a rate of 36.5 cents a mile. For 2003, the mileage rate falls to 36 cents a mile.  Creativity here can be rewarding. For example, if you take a friend to lunch in an attempt to use him as a reference or referral, you can use the cost of the lunch as a job-hunting expense.

       Effectiveness Tip of the Week   from an email I receive from the folks at  urlLink FranklinCovey     Your Personal Cornucopia   Take stock of your personal cornucopia.  Is it abundant and bountiful?  To live a rich life, it's imperative to believe in your ability to prosper -- that you are deserving.  Once understood and embraced, an abundance mentality allows you to see your life and your relationships from a new perspective.  It's about sharing the wealth and focusing on the universal truth that there is truly enough in this world for everyone.  A few tips:  Ponder how and what it would take to interact more successfully in your every day life. Let wisdom inspire you to become more generous with yourself and others in order to reap the benefits. Get rid of "all about me" and develop an everyone-can-win-mindset.   Some related quotes, also posted at  urlLink QuotesBlog :   "I am he as you are we and we are all together."  -- John Lennon and Paul McCartney  "Can you stop viewing the world through I-glasses?"  -- from  The Portable 7 Habits   "This is your life, your one and only life -- so take excellence very personally."  -- Scott Johnson

       Effectiveness Tip of the Week   from a weekly email I get from the folks at  urlLink FranklinCovey     Rocks 'n' Roles!   Identifying roles and assigning specific weekly goals to each one will help you balance. A role is a key responsibility or relationship in your life. Here's what to do:  List at least two of your most important personal or professional roles, (i.e. parent, manager, volunteer). Ask yourself "What is the one most important thing I can do in each role this week that will help me balance?" These goals or rocks form a solid foundation on which you build your weekly activities. Example: "Designer--Read 30 minutes from trade magazine." Make specific appointments for each goal in your planning device. As things come up during the week, prioritize and schedule around your goals. Your week will rock!

       Effectiveness Tip of the Week   via the folks at  urlLink FranklinCovey :   First, some  urlLink Quotes :   "Learn to say no. It will be of far more use to you than to be able to read Latin." -- Charles Haddon Spurgeon "A 'no' uttered from the deepest conviction is better than a 'yes' merely uttered to please, or what is worse, to avoid trouble." -- Mahatma Ghandi "When your daily activities are in concert with your highest priorities, you have a credible claim to inner peace." -- Hyrum Smith   No Thank You   No.  Nicht.  Nulle.  No matter how it comes out, saying "no" isn't always easy.  Project overload, interruptions, and demanding coworkers can make it tough to speak this language.  Remember, you have a right to say no... graciously but firmly.  If you respond evasively, you'll build false expectations.  Saying no takes practice.  Here are some phrases that might help:  "I have so much on my plate now that I don't know when I can get to it.  But I do know someone over here who can help you now." "Sure, I can help you with your request as long as we both understand that what I agreed to do for you yesterday might be delayed." "Thanks for thinking about me, but no thanks." "I won't be able to do it until tomorrow, but I could provide you with some resources that might help you do it today."

However, statistics also show that setting realistic goals, adopting a plan of action and sticking to that plan can be the deciding factor in the ability to successfully achieve a goal.  According to the study:  78% of successfully achieved goals had plans. 84% of goals were successfully achieved within the original plan

Greater numbers of people are becoming independent contractors, as businesses outsource more work, and being at the top of their game technology-wise enhances their chances of having steady work."

Tear up those traditional New Year's resolutions and try these tips:   Re-evaluate your New Year's resolutions : Do yourself a favor and rewrite them.  If they aren't related to a principle or a value you believe strongly in, take them off your list.  Don't lose control : Don't let your goals control your life by making you feel guilty or overwhelmed.  Turn them into a framework to explore your own creativity.  Measure up :  Set clear and definite goals with quantifiable standards to measure them against.  Aim to Achieve :  A new planner, a motivational training course, and software to keep it all together... arm yourself with the tools needed to achieve your goals. 365 days to achieve your goals-- how's that for no excuses?

       Bush to Unveil Economic-Stimulus Package    urlLink The Associated Press reports  that President George W. Bush said he will unveil an economic stimulus package next week: Aides have said in recent days that the president has not yet approved any new economic stimulus plan, and Bush gave few clues about what the package will contain. He made plain, though, that its primary focus will be to create jobs.   "What I'm worried about is job creation, and I'm worried about those who are unemployed," he said.

       Effectiveness Tip of the Week   via email from the folks at  urlLink FranklinCovey :    And the winner is...   "I'd like to thank you, and you. Oh, and you." Effectively working with others really is an art. Being in the limelight appeals to almost everyone, but cooperation, not competition, is at the heart of win-win relationships. Win-win means agreements or solutions benefit and satisfy all parties-not your way or my way, but a better way. See if these tips can help you get a better angle on win-win:   Solid Performance.   When the camera's not rolling, does your walk and talk reflect what matters most to you? If you know what is a win for you, others will as well. Integrity of character establishes trust.  Balance.   A win-win requires maturity-a balance between courage and consideration. You express your feelings and ideas with courage, but also share the stage and allow others to do the same.  Plenty for All.   With win-wins, you develop an Abundance Mentality® and realize that everyone can have a piece of the pie. Sharing prestige and recognition opens the doors for greater options, alternatives, and creativity. Mutually beneficial solutions -- what could be more rewarding?

       Effectiveness Tip of the Week   via email from the folks at  urlLink FranklinCovey :    Adept at Adapting   "If anything can go wrong, it will."  Mr. Murphy!  Just where is your silver lining?  We're not into peddling pessimism, but a hearty does of reality comes in handy now and again.  The proverbial "wrench in the system" can strike anywhere, anytime.  Unexpected change -- it's the law.   Expect it.   Change happens.  It's one of the few constants in society.  Commonly associated with negative circumstances and outcomes, unexpected change often gets a bad rap.  Yet, unexpected change can be exhilarating and extremely positive.  I feel a Paradigm Shift&trade; coming on!  Plan on it.   Rule of thumb:  "Plan weekly, adapt daily."  When reviewing your daily activities, factor in time for unexpected changes -- things that throw your schedule off track.  You'll feel less frustrated and more in control.  Be prepared.  Go with it.   Kicking and screaming will only get you so far.  Change is good.  Adapting, adjusting, and making modifications to changing circumstances will yield new opportunities, new ideas, and new perspectives. Unexpected change -- your friend indeed!  What else did you expect?

"This is the place," you think, as you wait for a bite.  Another snag!  You begin to reel as the tension increases.  Snap!  Tired of fishing for information?  According to one study, you may spend up to 28 minutes a day looking for lost information.  What a drag on your time and energy!  Cast aside your old habits and try some new techniques:   What, When, Where.  When you capture information for future access, remember the basics:"What" information you'll need to access, "When" will you need it (day and time), and "Where" will you store it in your planning device.  Consistency.   No matter whether you use a calendar, planner, or handheld, record needed information the same way each time.  Floaters.   Eliminate floating information -- any piece of information you have written down that you cannot have at your fingertips within 10 seconds.  Give it a try.  You'll be hooked!

People with depression are more likely to call in sick and be otherwise unproductive at work.   In a study that tracked 5000 people over five years, the researchers found that "42% of those who showed symptoms of depression in the study's first year eventually lost their jobs."  Lead researcher Mary A. Wooley, MD, writes: There's a huge stigma associated with depression.  People need to realize that depression is a disease just like diabetes and that there are plenty of treatments that offer relief from suffering and can also help you keep your job. People need to overcome the stigma and not be so embarrassed about saying: 'I need help.'

       Effectiveness Tip of the Week   from the folks at  urlLink FranklinCovey :    Take it to the bank.  KA-CHING!   How are your EBAs these days?  You know, your Emotional Bank Accounts -- the trust you have built up in your different relationships.  Still waiting for a "statement" to arrive?  Here's one:  If you don't know, you're probably overdrawn!  Maintaining a reserve of trust in relationships requires constant investing.  Consider this advice:   Bad checks .  What you consider to be a deposit (like going to the movies when your date wants to talk) may actually be a withdrawal for others.  They can't collect on your efforts because it does not meet their actual needs.  Really understanding others is key to building trust.  Pocket change . Showing respect, kindness, and courtesy may seem like small deposits, but over time they compound and increase your reserve.  Neglecting the little things will soon have you in the red.  Count on me .  Breaking commitments or promises often can bankrupt you.  Keeping them is the best way to save for a rainy day in any relationship. Rich relationships -- what a great payoff!

       Effectiveness Tip of the Week    The Delicacies of Delegation   Parents, managers, and people in general have trouble letting go, and when they do, it's gofer mania!  "Hey, you!  Go for this and go for that."  It's pretty hard to supervise even one person when you are involved in every move he/she makes.  Effective delegation focuses on results, not methods, and allows others to use their imagination, free will, and conscience to get the job done.  Here's some advice:   Desired Results.  Clearly articulate what needs to be done, not how to do it.  Describe in detail the desired result so that the other person virtually sees it.  Guidelines.  Make sure there are parameters within which people are to operate.  Point out potential failure paths -- what not to do versus what to do.  Resources.  Help people understand what human, financial, technical, or organizational resources are available to them.  Accountability.  Set up standards of performance that will be used in evaluating results and when those evaluations will occur.  Consequences.  Specify what will happen, both good and bad, as a result of the evaluation. Effective delegation -- gofer it!

        urlLink U.S. House Panel OKs Job Training Overhaul    "The government's $5 billion jobs training and services programs would be combined into state block grants in legislation approved Thursday by a House committee."  "The legislation 'would help improve results for Americans striving to get back to work,' said the committee chairman, Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio. He said the bill would trim the bureaucracy, provide greater cooperation among those helping to develop the work force, and further emphasize basic skills in adult education programs."  I'm all for striving toward government efficiency.   urlLink Read more...

        urlLink Manpower Professional - Dayton Office    Some interesting developments... Yesterday I contacted the local Manpower office (see link above) to speak to the guy with whom I'd been working on my recent assignment.  I spoke to someone who stated that he no longer works for the company.  I was surprised.  I had just seen him with his boss a month ago at the Greater Dayton IT Alliance meeting.  I asked this person if the office had a most recent copy of my resume, and I found out that they did not.  Apparently, since my guy had left the company, he did not hand over the updated resume I had emailed.  Okay then.  So, I just emailed the office an updated copy of my resume.  I sent it to their "catch-all" email address, which I found through the Office Locator portion of the website.  Now, I need to send another copy to that other recruiter whom I'd emailed last week.  Cheers!

       Effectiveness Tip of the Week   via email from the folks at  urlLink FranklinCovey     I Do   This Information Age can make you believe that knowing really is doing.  But doing requires, well, DOING something!  Many times there's a gap between knowing and doing.  Yet, once you close the gap and unite knowing and doing, sparks really fly!  Do I hear bells?  Repeat after me: "I affirm the special bond and unique relationship that exists between knowing and doing and promise to keep it alive always." (Sniffle!)  Here's some advice:   Details.   Planning is essential for converting ideas into action.  But don't get hung up on details, wasting precious time and resources debating specifics of strategy and implementation.  View plans like blueprints -- where you focus on essentials and leave room for adjustments.  Embrace technology.   Technology produces new tools for getting things done in a changing world.  Seek every opportunity at work and at home to learn and use these tools.  Risky business.   Fear of failing may prevent you from doing a lot of things, yet knowing comes from doing.  Be more willing to tackle risk in your life.  You'll never know until you try! I now pronounce you... umm... more effective!

        urlLink Toastmasters International&trade;    This afternoon my wife and I stopped at the school administration building, and I spotted an annoucment for a  urlLink local Toastmasters International&trade; club .  I was reminded of my recent visits to the  urlLink Mid Day Cabaret , the club at  urlLink LexisNexis , where I worked for a short while.  Twelve years ago, when I was co-oping for General Dynamics Land Systems in Michigan, I became a member of the  urlLink Hi Nooners  club.  Since these meetings are often open to anyone interested, I may very well attend some meetings of the local  urlLink Dayton Toastmasters&trade; Clubs .  These venues are great places to network, so I'll have to be sure to have plenty of business cards when I go.   urlLink Find a club near you .

       More Networking Stuff   Yesterday my wife, daughter, and I went bowling at a local bowling alley, caled Bowlero (cute name).  It was set up as a Family Fun time by the events coordinator at Keisha's school.  We got to play for a discounted price, and it was Bumper Bowling.  Needless to say, my bowling average didn't improve by that much!  What does this have to do with networking?  As we're getting ready to leave, I started talking with another father about his child and what he does for a living.  Well, I had also brought some business cards I made for myself, and I gave him and his friend a card.  We also saw one of my daughter's classmates with his mother.  We've been wanting to keep in touch with his parents, so I gave my wife a card to give her, along with some paper so that we could get her phone number as well.  It's  this  aspect of the job search that I enjoy the most.  It does provide immediate results, but it plants seeds that may someday come to fruition.

       I guess you could call THAT networking   This morning a representative from the local gas delivery company came by to our place.  He stated that he'd been ordered to either collect a certain past due amount of money from us or shut off our service.  I explained to him our family's current situation, and he, while very sympathetic, explained that it would be better for us to not have it shut off and then reconnected again.  Fortunately, we had the amount in the bank account.  Mom was outside with us as well.  I asked if he could take a check, and then went inside to get the checkbook.  I returned to the representative with the checkbook and wrote the check for the past due amount.  I also told him that I was grateful that they hadn't turned the service off when the weather was cold, like it was last month.  The, get this:  he asked me what kind of work I did.  I told him that I did some computer programming, and he said that he might know of someone who could help me.  I asked him if I could give him a business card.  He said yes, and I went back inside to get some business cards I'd made up for myself.  I gave him two of them, in fact.  As the rep took off, Mom mentioned that the guy told her I'd been a lot better than many of the folks he's had to meet about similar matters like this.  Mom thanked him and they got to talking about my being a Christian, and the guy said he could tell I was a Christian by how I'd behaved.  So, I  guess  you could consider that networking.

       Effectiveness Tip of the Week   via email from the folks at  urlLink FranklinCovey :    Finances -- Let's Get Personal   You've got places to go, people to see, and things to do -- in other words, lots of bills.  Show me the money!  Do you know where every cent is spent?  Money doesn't grow on trees, you know!  Spare no expense in getting your personal finances in order.  Here are a few tips:   Time is money.   In your planning device, schedule a daily or weekly appointment with yourself to balance the books.  This is a good time to identify spending patterns and make necessary corrections.  Budget constraints.   Set up a monthly budget and stick to it.  There are great computer programs like Quicken&copy; and Microsoft&copy; Money that'll do most of the work for you.  Remember to include savings and a personal budget for you and only you.  Adjust as you go.   Don't throw in the towel when your budget's in the red.  It's an indication that you may be living beyond your means in some areas, and adjustments should be made (or else it's time for a raise)! Controlling personal finances -- common cents.  (Pun intended, ahem.)

       Effectiveness Tip of the Week   via email from the folks at  urlLink FranklinCovey     Feedback-Feast on It!   Today's special-feedback.  Sound good?  Asking for and receiving feedback requires a generous portion of humility.  Although it's hard to swallow sometimes, feedback tells you as much about the people from whom you receive it as it does about yourself.  Hungry for more?  Here are some ideas to chew on:   Large selection. Concentrate on your roles in your family, work, or community where you feel additional perspective would be helpful.  For example, parents could get feedback from children, a spouse, or other parents.  Different tastes.   Feedback can be formal or informal, anonymous or face-to-face.  You can use a questionnaire or just chat on the phone.  You know what's best for you.  Ingredients.   Be careful not to judge each other's character.  Feedback should be objective, and given against performance and effectiveness criteria.  Dish it out.   As soon as you receive feedback, analyze it and feed it back!  Involve others in creating an action plan based on their feedback.  Remember your manner and always say "Thanks." Come on, try it.  You'll like it!

       Wanted:  Your  Job Hunting Success Stories   I've noticed that I've been getting a number of visitors from  urlLink Where The Hell Did My Job Go?   Whether you're looking for career information or encouragement,  I'm  very encouraged that you're stopping by.  Let me take this moment to ask you for something.  I want to let others know about how you have successfully found a job. It may be your current one or a previous one - it doesn't matter. I want to encourage other job seekers with your success. You will receive no reimbursement from this, except for the gratification that your story has helped to inspire countless others who are where you once were.  Be specific, but don't mention any company names. That may sound like a contradiction in terms, and you may disagree with this approach - let me know and I may reconsider. Instead, use a generic title, such as "software development consulting company", "global consumer products company", and so on. If you would like some help, then let me know.  I will only use your initials or first name and last initial when presenting your success story. I am specifically interested in answers to the following:  What position were you applying for? How did you contact the particular company? Describe the interviewing process. Did you work part-time or as a contractor/consultant with the company before being hired? How long was the process from your first contact with the company to your first day of work? Describe your emotional state during the process. Were you anxious? Excited? Stressed? Impatient? Frustrated? Let us know.   So email me your job hunting success stories at danimal0416[nospam]@yahoo.com(remove the [nospam], of course), and we'll get them published here at "Get That Job!"

       Effectiveness Tip of the Week   via email from the folks at  urlLink FranklinCovey :    "Reflect"ology   Ever feel like you are making the same mistakes and struggling with the same problems week after week?  You may need the benefits of "reflect"ology.  Ever heard of it?  "Reflect"ology is a practice that's been around for many moons.  Reflecting about or evaluating the past week is a natural process that can help relieve stress, identify weaknesses, and get you back on your feet.  Don't feel pressured -- just relax and consider these tips for evaluating your week:   Examination.   Create a checklist of five or six self-evaluation questions and keep them in your planning system.  Examples include  "What challenges did I face this week and how did I overcome them?" "What goals did I not achieve and why?" "What can I learn from the week as a whole?"   Regular checkup.   Make an appointment with yourself each week and choose a place that is quiet.  Review your questions before you plan the next week.  Prevention.   You'll soon identify ineffective habits and patterns.  This knowledge will help you prevent making the same mistakes in the future. Weekly evaluation -- a cure for common ineffectiveness

       Effectiveness Tip of the Week   via a weekly email from the folks at  urlLink FranklinCovey     What did you expect?   "That's your job!"  "We didn't agree to that!"  "That's not what I meant!"  If your expectations are as "clear as mud," don't expect much else than, well, a pretty messy situation.  Clean up on Aisle 5!  Clarifying expectations in your family, work, and other relationships will help avoid misunderstandings, disappointments, and lack of trust.   Implicit vs. explicit.   Some expectations in relationships are implicit, like your boss expecting you to be at work on time.   Yet, many expectations are explicit, requiring further clarification.  Negative situations are created when you assume your expectations are self-evident and clearly understood by others.  Speak up.   In new relationships, get all the expectation out on the table at the beginning.  Clearly articulate who does what.  Almost all relationship difficulties are a result of ambiguous expectations around roles and goals.  Time and effort.   It's easy to pretend differences don't exist and to hope things will work out.  Investing time and effort up front to clarify expectations will save time and effort in the future. Clarifying expectations -- any questions?

       On Making Oneself Available   Our family uses one phone line for regular telephone and Internet use.  Our family is in such financial circumstances that we cannot afford an additional phone line or DSL.  I recognized that while I am online at home that potential employers are not able to get through to us.  We're trying to make ourselves more available by letting employers know they can email us, but I have a feeling that we need some other way for them to contact us.  Does anyone know of a free voicemail service?  We may even want to look at how much getting the phone company's voicemail system is.  At least there we could have calls transferred to our voicemail if we were online or busy.  It's funny, but I've asked the above question without doing an Internet search first.  If I find anything, I'll post it here.   Update:   Good ol' Google, coming through again.  Check out  urlLink BuzMe .

       Organize and Document   lessons from the past tax filing year   I'd like to share some things I've learned from doing our family's taxes last week.  The main purpose in doing this is to get this stuff down so that I don't forget.  I also invite your input.  If I could sum it up in a word or phrase it would be Documentation and Organization.  I rememember when I worked as an Environmental Engineer for Alcoa Building Products, documentation was key to showing our proof that we complied with environmental laws and regulations.   If it wasn't in writing, then it never happened .  With that mindset, we needed to have well-organized files.  I remember the color scheme for the different types of environmental "media" (for lack of a better word): blue for water/wastewater, green for solid/hazardous waste, orange for toxic chemical information, red for air resource management, and so on.  We even had a document that described our file-keeping system.  The intent of this was to provide quick and easy retrieval of documentation in the event of an audit and for future reporting.  Our family has a number of things going on that merit good recordkeeping practices.  For one thing, both my wife and I are actively looking for employment.  Mileage and other job search expenses are tax-deductible, provided you have documentation.  And we need to keep track of contacts, companies to whom we've sent resumes, follow up correspondence, and so on.  Additionally, our daughter Keisha, has hearing loss in both ears.  Several times we've needed to provide documentation for insurance, education, and medical reasons.  And then there's the bills.  Holy cow!  Bills for everything related to running a family.  There is a huge need to document that bills were paid, along with conversations with creditors and other individuals.  I think a big reason why I've procrastinated in the past is because I've dreaded all the effort in getting this information together.  I see now that if I put forth the work up front to get organized and document things, then, when the time comes to retrieve that information, it won't appear as daunting.  So, you could say that I'm having another kind of a "birthday" today.

       Follow Your Path   from a "Recipes for the Soul" card, as a matter of fact   YOU WILL NEED:  Perception Individuality Control "You have to do your own growing no matter how tall your grandfather was." -- Abraham Lincoln  Have you ever looked at a family photo and discovered an uncanny resemblance to one of your relatives?  Did you notice any differences too?  Those moments of recognition remind us how connected we are to each other, but also how unique we are.  It's important to cherish our common traits, but it's just as essential to achieve our own identity.  SIMPLE STEPS  Treat an older relative to dinner.  Ask about their life and interests growing up.  You may learn valuable lessons from their experiences that will help you along the way. Parents are not to blame.  When life doesn't turn out exactly as planned, we have a tendencey to blame our parents.  Instead, look inside yourself for answers.  What happens next is up to you.

       Effectiveness Tip of the Week   from the folks at  urlLink FranklinCovey :    Self-Exploration: The Terrain of Heart and Soul   What do you really value in life?  Perhaps you have taken some time lately to reflect on what resonates within you -- those ideas and convictions that need no outside validation.  Because of demands on your time, you might not contemplate your values as often as you would like as you go about living.  Yet it's important to make a conscious connection with those values that govern your life -- the foundations upon which your life is both anchored and navigated; things like family, humor, and respect.  To help you explore your values further, try this exercise:  Locate a comfortable environment free from noise and distractions.  Reflect on the following questions and listen to your heart and conscience.  If I had to walk away from everything I ever loved, what would be left behind? What would I miss most if it were taken from me? What is of greatest importance or value in my life? As you go about your week, it will be vitally important to determine whether or not there is consistency between where you spend your time and what you value most.

       What Does Your Answering Machine Say to Employers?   Anyone who has called our house within the last couple weeks has been treated to an answering machine message where we state our names, and then the following: You know what to do and when to do it! In the past we've also set it up to say We will work for hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Please leave your message after the beep. These probably aren't the best messages for potential employers, I've realized.  HotJobs has a link to an article about this topic, but it currently doesn't work.  It may work in the future, so I'll post the link  urlLink here .   Update, 2003 April 22:  I'm at the  urlLink Job Center , and I just checked the link.  It works.

        urlLink Ohio Job Prospector    Job Prospector is a research site, not a job posting site.  The career information it provides is meant to provide users with an "Inside Look" at employers that is not available to most job seekers.  Since they list career profiles and not job postings, the manner in which you respond to these employers is very important.  If sending a resume, please be sure to explain that you researched the particular employer and are inquiring about potential career opportunities based on that research.

Apparently so: NEW YORK - American creativity and innovation did not die with the collapse of the Internet bubble or the Nasdaq market. Technology companies with good ideas and good execution of those ideas can still grow at an extraordinary pace. One thing for sure, however, is that such growth won't be even across all parts of the technology spectrum.  With a lead-in like that, you just have to find out who the companies are, don't you?

        urlLink Forbes.com | Alternative Routes    Hello, fellow job seekers!  I'm back home now, going through the email.  Here's something interesting: NEW YORK - This year an estimated 1.2 million college seniors will graduate into one of the worst economies in a decade. Unemployment is at 5.8% and job prospects for graduates are bleak, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers. Even jobs that grads don't want may be tough to land.  Lest this generation think it's the first to enter the real world in a bout of career angst, a quick reality check. Many career success stories began in a state of doubt and confusion--eventually deviating from their intended route. Our slideshow highlights eight executives' surprising starts--and advice--to share with a panicky grad near you.  urlLink Read more and check out the slide show...    Update:  I just came back from watching the slide show.  Pretty cool.  I didn't take notes, unfortunately.  I'll have to stop back later.

       A Different Kind of Bar Exam   I needed something "punny" to go with this post.  I had a meeting with the president of the local bartending school here in Dayton yesterday.  I think I would make a good bartender -- mixologist, to be more accurate.  I have an outgoing personality, and I had a chemistry set when I was growing up.  Well, I never got the $300 microscope when I was 7 years old (that was in 1977 dollars, by the way).  Alas, I digress.  The meeting went very well, up until she mentioned the tuition.  See, trying to live off unemployment has been hard to begin with.  Then laying out several hundreds of dollars up front for tuition... well, the bubble went "pop".  I went away, feeling a little bit downhearted.  But I think that the school might be able to work with me on the tuition.  After all, it's a two-week course, and the tuition is based on what an average weekly take-home pay for a bartender would be.  So, in two weeks, I'd theoretically be able to make up the money I spent toward tuition.  We'll see.  I'm going to talk with her again on Monday afternoon.  Hopefully, I'll be able to start the class that Monday, too.  Stay tuned!

       Effectiveness Tip of the Week   via email from the folks at  urlLink FranklinCovey     On the Road Again   Whoops, I think we took the wrong road.  I turn left, right?  Where is your roadmap to your destiny in life taking you?  Take some time out to seriously identify what really matters most in your life and what you really want to be and do.  To really begin your journey with the end in mind means to start with a clear understanding of your destination.  It means to know where you're going so you better understand where you are now so that the steps you take are always in the right direction.   Find your passion.   What do you care about most?  Allow your passion to take more priority in life.  Follow the big picture of your life.   Allocate your time more efficiently and don't waste time on things that aren't important to the big picture.  Spell out to yourself a dream version of your passion.   How does it feel?  What does it look like?  Where would it take you?  Get a move on.   Don't wait until a better time to move toward what you want.  There is no better time.  The time is now.  Stay open to changes.   Just because things aren't going exactly to plan doesn't mean they are not in alignment.  Trust the process.

It also may make filing tax returns next year more complicated...  Two provisions will give small businesses an opportunity to recoup equipment purchases and other investments this year, encouraging businesses to expand and entrepreneurs to start new ventures.   The items allow small businesses to write off $100,000 in investments this year. All businesses could depreciate half their assets this year, recouping their money faster. For example, Luscombe said, a small business that spends $150,000 on new equipment this year can write off $100,000 immediately and recoup half of the remaining expense through depreciation this year. As a result, a business can immediately write off as an expense at least $125,000 of its equipment purchases.  urlLink read the full article...

       Job Hunting Success - Dan   It's been awhile since I've been off work.  I completed a temporary assignment for a local IT company last February.  While I've been able to do some web development since then, I haven't had anything substantial or consistent or otherwise.  In addition, my temporary unemployment compensation has been due to expire at the end of next month.  Last week I contacted the company I used to work for, just to touch base, and I spoke with someone who said he believed that there was another opportunity at the same site where I had worked previously.  I told him I was interested and available, and he promised to get back with me.  This morning he called me and told me that the job was for software testing, and that it was to last for the entire year.  While it doesn't pay as well as I was getting previously, others have used it to springboard themselves into other opportunities.  After I told him I was interested, he advised me to email him an updated copy of my resume so that he can present me to the company at his meeting with them tomorrow.  I'm rather optimistic that I could get this work.

       Effectiveness Tip of the Week   via email from the folks at  urlLink FranklinCovey :    Get SMART!   Ever find yourself lamenting, "I missed it by that much!" when you don't reach a goal?  You think your plans are executed with precisions, and you avoid any covert obstacles that might be placed in your path, but you still come up short.  Your self-confidence wanes and you lose to the desire to make more goals.  Careful!  Chaos is right around the corner.  Be an agent of change and get SMART with your goals.  Here's the secret:   Specific:  Your goals should be clear and definite.  Measurable:  There should be a quantifiable standard against which to measure results.  Achievable:  Are your goals realistically doable with the time and resources available?  Relevant: Is what really matters most to you reflected in your goals?  Time-Dimensioned:  There should be clear and specific deadlines.  You'll be back in "control" sooner than you know it.

       Thoughts on the Job Fair   I attended a job fair at the Dayton Job Center this past Wednesday, April 30, 2003.  I've spent a lot more time at the Job Center lately, searching for a job and getting set up with other services.  Last fall, I attended another job fair at the Job Center as well.  I wasn't sure exactly what to expect.  I knew from attending the job fair last fall that there were sure to be a lot of people there.  I also expected that there would be a lot of organizations looking for people in the health care fields.  Both of these expectations were met.  I felt that there were so many people at the job fair that it was hard to be in a one-on-one conversation with any recruiter for very long.  I noticed a long line of people waiting to talk to recruiters from one company in particular.  Since my wife Jennie has been ill lately and was not able to attend the job fair, I used the opportunity to network a little bit with the health care companies that were looking for nurses asisstants.  I also went to see which companies would be looking for people in my field.  I saw a few of them.  Yet, when I talked to company representatives in person, their recommendation was still to send my resume via the company's website or via email.  I still wonder why these companies were present at the job fair at all if they were just going to ask me to send my resume to the company electronically.  As I left the job fair, I was encouraged to chat with another job seeker who was looking for a job in accounting.  We used the opportunity to network and share our thoughts on the job fair.  I still believe that job fairs are great ways to meet companies and network with other job seekers, and I look forward to attending others in the future.

       Effectiveness Tip of the Week   via email from the folks at  urlLink FranklinCovey     Push Pause   You’ve put in 8+ hours at the office; attended a PTA meeting, soccer practice, and/or a doctor’s appointment; and now you’re in the midst of helping with homework, feeding the dog, and clearing out the answering machine.  It’s high time for a time-out.  A walk?  A movie?  Now—before you scoff at the notion and claim it would take a sheer miracle to find extra time for that time-out, realize that it is well worth it.  Taking a moment to yourself reduces stress and leaves you refreshed and focused, not irritable and distracted.  You’ll feel better and have a fresh outlook to tackle all the tasks that are waiting for you.  A few tips:  Your time-out doesn’t have to be something big. Sit on the porch and enjoy a lemonade, take a small hike, or lounge on the couch with a magazine. If evenings are hectic, try waking up 30 minutes earlier to soak in the tub, walk the dog, or savor a warm drink. Do not get distracted. If your family is around, tell them they’re in charge of answering the door, the phone, and that, unless it’s an emergency, you’re off duty for a few minutes.   Pushing pause for a personal time-out—rewind and try it again!

        urlLink Employers cracking down on Net abusers    LONDON -- Sending inappropriate e-mails and using the Internet during working hours is likely to result in dismissal or suspension of offending staff in almost of half the cases, according to a survey carried out on behalf of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), a professional body for the Human Resources industry. Be careful out there, people.

        urlLink Online Forms Call for Strategy on Salary Question    I've experienced it.  If you've filled out an online application to a company, you've probably experienced it, too.  The application will not budge unless you specify your salary requirements and/or history.  Nearly all job hunters have been advised to leave this question as one of the last ones to be answered; i.e., to talk about it once you've been offered the job.  This article, again from The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, offers some strategic help.

       More Job Changes   I received this email from a friend and brother in Christ who drives a truck for a living.  He periodically sends out broadcast updates.  The latest is below:  Hi there, brothers/sisters!  I have some changes going on. After some advice from brothers online, I decided to change to another company. The reasons:  Opportunity. This company will allow me to deliver refridgerated items (can't with Werner). Plus, I will be able to deliver to Canada! Income. By doing so, I will make more per mile than now. New business. After 30 days with this company, I can lease my own truck, and make far more, as an Independent Contractor (aka Small-Business Owner). Downside. Yes, there is one. Because of the expenses while running my own business, I will be driving 48-state for at least a couple years.   So, I will be home for several days starting around the 4th, switching from one job to another. I pray God gives you more job opportunities also!  Todd

       Tech Thursday Wrap Up   I went to  urlLink Buffalo Wild Wings  this evening (Thursday - haven't gone to bed yet) for the  urlLink Tech Thursday  event put on by the  urlLink Greater Dayton IT Alliance .  The restaurant had recently installed a  urlLink wireless networking system  (I don't know the tech term for it.), and we all wanted to see what it was like.  I was impressed.  There were approximately 20 laptops connected, and the speed was 1 MB per second!  I showed one of the guys  urlLink my fotolog  as a test of a page with some pictures.  It downloaded in a fraction of a second.  Pretty cool stuff.  I also met some other folks who are looking for work.  One guy pointed me to  urlLink LinksToJobs.com: the single job posting source for Cincinnati, Dayton, and Columbus, Ohio !  I've added it to the link roll, where it should be aptly put.  Actually, I headed over to the bar and picked up an  urlLink NTN game player .  The guy who sat down next to me was an unemployed CFO - Chief Financial Officer.  I suppose there's not a big demand for folks fitting that job description in the Dayton area, huh?

       Enjoy What You Do    I received this email from a friend, who drives a truck across the country for a living. Another week down, and I hope all dads had a wonderful day Sunday. I am in Las Vegas for a few days of rest & relaxation with my brother, sister-in-law, and friends from church! For instance, I saw The Strip, Hoover Dam, and with some singles here, ate sushi! Gamble? Nope. I may make good money, but gambling will lose it.  My trips for the week... Roanoke VA to Des Moines IA and Roseville MN (mail), Roseville MN to Denver CO (plastic drop covers), Fort Collins CO to Las Vegas NV (Budweiser beer).  Anyway, I pray you all find joy in something you do. Why do something just for money, when you can find a job that both pays AND makes you happy?  I understand some may have a job simply to make money, and if so, enjoy it!

       Effectiveness Tip of the Week   via email from  urlLink FranklinCovey.com     Me, Inc. A wise investment.   Up and down, up and down.  Does your life seem like a volatile stock market these days?  Some weeks you are on an upward climb, full of energy and ambition, while other weeks you spiral into a dive waiting for that inevitable crash.  Pssst...Want some "insider" advice?  Invest in yourself!  Consider this analysis:   Personal Portoflio:  Your personal investments are divided into four areas: physical, social/emotional, mental, and spiritual.  Weekly Investing:  Choose a weekly goal for each area and record them in your planning system. Examples: Exercise three times a week (physical). Call a long-lost friend (social/emotional). Write in a journal (mental). Meditate or pray (spiritual). Be sure to schedule an appointment with yourself for each goal.   Return on Investment:  You'll be an IPO (Incredible Personal Offering!) at home, work, or in other relationships. It's a trade you'll be glad you made!

       Job Search Frustrations   Today, on the way from my therapist appointment, I saw that the Longhorn restaurant on Dorothy Lane had just opened.  I went inside to get an application.  One of the managers told me to come back at 2 PM this afternoon so that we could talk about a bartending position.  I filled out the application, and got changed for the interview.  When I arrived at the restaurant, the gentleman with whom I spoke earlier wasn't available.  I talked with another manager/partner, who told me, "If you had only been here 3 weeks ago..."  This was not what I needed to hear, but I finished the meeting gracefully.  Then I went to the bartending school just to check in.  The manager there told me to call her back before 5 PM today.  I then went to "Restaurant Row" along Miller Lane to obtain and complete applications at restaurants I had not previously applied to earlier.  It was a "learning experience."  Many of these restaurants do not hire bartenders, but instead hire servers who later get "promoted" to bartenders.  I told one proprietor of a certain "Austrailian-themed" restaurant that I was willing to be a server, but he basically said that, unless I had 2 to 3 years of experience serving I shouldn't even consider completing an application for his restaurant.  I asked him if he knew where I could go to get this experience he was looking for.  He didn't have any idea.  I was very upset and frustrated at what he said, and my whole saga of finding a job, by this time.  He offered his hand for me to shake, and, at first, I didn't want to do it, but I resisted the urge to be rude and shook it anyway.  As I walked out, I thought about getting some rotten eggs and returning to the restaurants.  I won't, though.  I came home and vented.  You may be aware that I have a blog called " urlLink Letters to God ."  It is a great way for me to pray, and I feel better for having done it.  Much better than I would have if I, say, found some rotten eggs, if you know what I mean.  I could probably continue this post for a little while, but I guess I'll end it here.  Let me encourage you to share your frustrations.  Write them down, share with a friend or confidant, send an email - just be open with it so that you can feel better.  Sometimes having a listening ear is the best therapy.  Bar's open! :)

       Make the Most of Every Opportunity   My daughter started Kindergarten last week, and I met another family, whose daughter gets picked up at the same bus stop.  I told the mom about my looking for a job, and a day or so later, she told me that she'd been looking at her company's job board for me.  I didn't ask her to do it, but she did it anyway.  We're getting ready to head to the bus stop shortly, and I've created another few business cards to give her.  That way she'll have my email address and other information so that she can forward me email, and she can also forward my card to other potential interested parties.  Never miss an opportunity to network!   Update:   She wasn't there this morning.  Perhaps her daughter was ill.  Maybe tomorrow!

        urlLink More Job Seekers Are Trying To Hide Their Ages    According to a  urlLink recent article in USA Today , a survey conducted by the online job board HotJobs reveals that many older job seekers are omitting dates or work experience from their resumes, while others are opting for hair coloration products, or, in some cases, cosmetic surgery, to make themselves appear younger to potential employers.  Take resume fudging, for example: Some career strategists push job applicants to omit dates from résumés. Career coach Kathy Sanborn routinely advises clients to omit graduation dates and list only the last 10 years of their work history. Be careful, though, as such tactics can backfire.  Some hiring managers may see omissions in work experience as another reason to remove the resume from their pile.  This begs an important question, which I offer to you, gentle readers and job seekers: How do you go about placing enough work experience (if you have a lot of it) on your resume while keeping it to an appropriate length, usually a maximum of two pages?   Submit your comments here, or if commenting is unavailable, send me an email to danimal0416 at yahoo dot com.

       Proof That Your Job May Not Be That Bad?   Yesterday,  urlLink Karen  posted from an email she recently received (check out the Thursday, July 24, 2003 post -- permalinks are not available).  I recalled reading the story some time ago, and on a hunch I checked out  urlLink Snopes.com  to see if it was a true story.   urlLink They couldn't really determine whether it was or not, but claim that certain details of the story are suspect .  At the same time they agree that there is no harm in enjoying the story.  I prefer the version that Karen posted because it doesn't contain as much profanity as the one on the  urlLink Snopes.com page  does.  So, without further ado, here it is: This is even funnier when you realize it's real! Next time you have a bad day at work, think of this guy.  Rob is a commercial saturation diver for Global Divers in Louisiana.  He performs underwater repairs on offshore drilling rigs.  Below is an E-mail he sent to his sister. She then sent it to radio station 103.2 on FM dial in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, who was sponsoring a worst job experience contest. Needless to say, she won. Hi Sue,  Just another note from your bottom-dwelling brother.  Last week I had a bad day at the office.  I know you've been feeling down lately at work, so I thought I would share my dilemma with you to make you realize it's not so bad after all.  Before I can tell you what happened to me, I first must bore you with a few technicalities of my job.  As you know, my office lies at the bottom of the sea.  I wear a suit to the office.  It's a wet suit.  This time of year the water is quite cool. So what we do to keep warm is this:  We have a diesel powered industrial water heater.  This $20,000 piece of equipment sucks the water out of the sea.  It heats it to a delightful temperature.  It then pumps it down to the diver through a garden hose, which is taped to the air hose.  Now this sounds like a darn good plan, and I've used it several times with no complaints.  What I do, when I get to the bottom and start working, is take the hose and stuff it down the back of my wet suit.  This floods whole suit with warm water.  It's like working in a Jacuzzi.  Everything was going well until all of a sudden, my butt started to itch.  So, of course, I scratched it.  This only made things worse. Within a few seconds my butt started to burn.   I pulled the hose out from my back, but the damage was done.  In agony I realized what had happened.  The hot water machine had sucked up a jellyfish and pumped it into my suit.  Now, since I don't have any hair on my back, the jellyfish couldn't stick to it.  However, the crack of my butt was not as fortunate.  When I scratched what I thought was an itch, I was actually grinding the jellyfish into the crack of my butt.  I informed the dive supervisor of my dilemma over the communicator.  His instructions were unclear due to the fact that he, along with five other divers, were all laughing hysterically.  Needless to say I aborted the dive.  I was instructed to make three agonizing in-water decompression stops totaling thirty-five minutes before I could reach the surface to begin my chamber dry decompression.  When I arrived at the surface, I was wearing nothing but my brass helmet.  As I climbed out of the water, the medic, with tears of laughter running down his face, handed me a tube of cream and told me to rub it on my butt as soon as I got in the chamber. The cream put the fire out, but I couldn't poop for two days because my butt was swollen shut.  So, next time you're having a bad day at work, think about how much worse it would be if you had a jellyfish shoved up your butt. Now repeat to yourself, "I love my job, I love my job, I love my job.”

The Gartner projection, in a 15 July research note by Diane Morello, would bring total IT job losses to one million, when added to the 500,000 IT professionals estimated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to have lost their jobs in the United States since 2001.  urlLink read more...

       The Balancing Act   Compared to 25 years ago, the typical family puts in 1,000 more hours a year at work and more than 8 million of us work two or more jobs.  So it's no wonder that finding a balance between work and life is difficult.  But balance is essential to our well-being and our ability to perform well at home and at work.  Here are five ways to get a better footing:   Simplify.   Need help with housecleaning?  Consider hiring a cleaning person once a week.  Feel like you don't have time?  Say "no" to things you don't want to do or don't have time to do.  Be grateful. Even in the midst of the most hectic and stressful times of life, there are things for which we can be thankful.  Reflecting on the good things in our lives helps keep an all-important balance in our outlook.  Be a kid and play.   Get down in the dirt and help the kids make mud pies, watch a movie with them, or have a long chat over coffee with your teen.  Give your family one-on-one time.  Pay attention to yourself.   If you don't stay healthy, you'll be less able to handle the stress of work and home.  Stop procrastinating.   It takes more energy fretting over not doing a project than actually doing it.  So save your energy for better things and just get started.     Source: Ragan Communications

        urlLink President Bush's Radio Address: July 19, 2003    I just read via the  urlLink U.S. Newswire , the text of the President's weekly radio address.  He talks a lot about the Jobs and Growth Act of 2003, which he recently signed into law: ... Next week, the United States Treasury will begin printing and mailing more than 25 million child tax credit checks, putting over $12 billion back into the hands of American families. These rebates are the result of the Jobs and Growth Act I recently signed into law, which increases the child tax credit from $600 to $1,000 per child. And because this new law reduced income tax rates, businesses earlier this month lowered tax withholding for worker paychecks. Now, those workers and their families have a lighter tax bill and more take-home pay...  ... My administration remains focused on faster economic growth that will translate into more jobs. Now that Americans can keep more of what they earn, we can expect to see rising demand for goods and services. And as demand increases, companies will need more workers to meet it...  ... Government does not create prosperity. Government can, however, create the conditions that make prosperity possible. The Jobs and Growth Act of 2003 was based on the fundamental faith in the energy and creativity of the American people. With hard work and daily determination, entrepreneurs and workers are moving this economy forward. The American economy is headed in the right direction, and we can be confident of better days ahead.

       Duck, duck, goose.   The game of chasing each other, fighting for a spot in the circle. And this, my fowl-loving friend, may not be a game you left behind in kindergarten.  Think about the people in your life who might be fighting for a spot in your circle - your circle of recognition.  If you adopt a pattern of life that focuses on golden eggs and neglects the goose, you will soon be without the asset that produces golden eggs.  On the other hand, if you only take care of the goose with no aim toward the golden eggs, you soon won't have the wherewithal to feed yourself or the goose.  Now, before you ruffle your feathers, here are a few tips:   Be timely.  Don't wait. Praise should be given as soon as possible after the action or achievement occurs.  Think individual-individual.   Recognize the individuals who took the positive action. If it was a group effort, first recognize the individuals and then the group as a whole.  Be sincere.   Be sincere and show that you care; otherwise the recognition does more harm than good. Sincere recognition—an eggcellent approach!

       Why The Check Was Not In The Mail   Well, I finally spoke with someone today from the ODJFS.  It turns out that I'm waiting for a determination to be made to see whether my application for the extended benefits will go through.  I should receive a determination letter within the next week or so.  Only if the application is approved, will I then be able to receive benefits.  I'm getting tired of having to deal with the government for all this stuff.  I miss having a regular paycheck.  I realize that I shouldn't have made a postdated car payment last week.  Sorry for this post to be such a downer.  It's just how I'm feeling right now.

       Monthly Focus: Abundance   In my Franklin Planner there is a montly focus that changes each month.  This month the focus is on having an "abundance-mentality."  It states: Live with the attitude that there is an abundance of resources and opportunities. I think that this is especially important to have with respect to the job search.  I find myself thinking that I have so much competition for a particular job.  If I win, then someone else loses.  This monthly focus is a challenge to see things differently.  Sure, the competition for jobs is heavy right now.  But why not think as though  your job  is out there, waiting for you to find it.  I've posted a number of great quotations about Abundance over at  urlLink QuotesBlog  for today, 2 July 2003.  I cannot link to all of them here, because they are all worthy of reading.  You will be encouraged as you think about what they mean.

        urlLink President Bush's Weekly Radio Address for August 2, 2003    In President Bush's weekly radio address to the nation this past weekend, he spoke mainly of how the economy is behaving, and commented specifically about job-creation and unemployment, among other things.  I've included some exerpts from his address below, but  urlLink you may want to read the entire text  yourself: This week, we received some encouraging news on the economy. The nation's economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter.  ...  Yet this week's employment report also shows that many Americans who want to work are still having trouble finding a job. My administration is acting to promote faster growth to encourage the creation of new jobs. The key to job growth is higher demand for goods and services. With higher demand, businesses are more likely to hire new employees.  The best way to promote growth and job creation is to leave more money in the pockets of households and small businesses, instead of taxing it away. So we lowered income tax rates, cut taxes on dividends and capital gains, reduced the marriage penalty and increased the child tax credit. This week, the checks for up to $400 per child started arriving in the mailboxes of American families. That money will help American families move the economy forward.  We have also taken action to help small businesses, who are the job creators of America. We increased tax incentives for equipment purchases, giving small businesses an additional reason to invest. More orders for machinery and equipment means more jobs. And more business investment can lead to greater worker productivity, which helps raise worker wages.  We are starting to see results from our actions. My administration's economists believe that if we had not passed tax relief, our unemployment rate would have been nearly one percentage point higher, and as many as 1.5 million Americans would not have the jobs they have today.  ...  America's economy has challenges, and I will not be satisfied until every American looking for work can find a job. By steady, persistent action, we are preparing the way for vigorous growth and more jobs. I have confidence in our economic future, because I have confidence in the people whose effort and creativity make this economy run -- the workers and the entrepreneurs of America.

       And Then There's This   "Today's drop in the unemployment rate is positive and surpasses market expectations. The drop in the labor force is due primarily to seasonal factors.  "We are encouraged by the steadily declining four-week moving average of new unemployment insurance claims, which also shows that job losses are slowing down significantly.  "We can also see where the new jobs are being created, such as temporary help services, which tends to be a leading indicator that signals stronger, more widespread job growth in the future. Other areas with job growth include leisure and hospitality, financial activities and, for the fifth straight month, construction."  -- Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao on July unemployment numbers released today, August 1, 2003    via  urlLink U.S. Newswire

        urlLink jobforjohn.com    John, who was recently "downsized" from a software company, followed President Bush's economic team (Treasury Secretary John Snow and Commerce Secretary Don Evans) around this week and even was able to talk to Snow directly: "What's your story?" Snow says.  I tell him I was laid off last week and saw that he was coming and I thought it was important to come here and let him see the reality of what's going on in today's economy.  "What industry were you in?"  "Most recently the software industry."  "That's a particularly vulnerable part of the economy."   "Yes, well, I need a new job and it doesn't look good."  "Just wait," he said. "The first tax cuts haven't really taken effect. So just wait... the second tax cut... well, it won't hit the economy for several months, but I'm sure you'll get a job."  "But, but... we've already lost over 900,000 jobs just since March first... a job at Wal-Mart just won't support my family."  "Just wait, I'm sure you'll find a job."  At that moment the car in front of me pulled ahead for their order and John stepped back from my window. The SS agents signalled for me to pull ahead.  "Just wait?!" I've got a $350 payment for this minivan, a morgage and two kids! Here's a guy who drives a few hundred miles to see you, four days after he's been laid off, and you tell him to "just wait?"   Boy I'd like to see those words on a PR banner behind Snow at the podium:                                                 Jobs and Growth: Just Wait.  urlLink Secretary Snow later mentioned the conversation to reporters .

        urlLink Will your job move to India?    A frequent topic of conversation (or the subject of posts, at least) lately has been the future of the job market, both in the short term and the long term.   urlLink This fantastic article from MSN Money  describes what's happening in the job market.  The bottom line, according to John Challenger, CEO of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the Chicago-based outplacement firm: “It’s false to think the only jobs that could go overseas are low-skilled jobs that pay low wages.” Yet the tone of the article is not all doom for job seekers.  In fact, it offers some encouraging words and even, for those looking for careers in areas that will be huge, some direction.  So, take heart, and  urlLink head over to the article!

        urlLink So, where are all the jobs?    This is the question posed by   urlLink U.S. News & World Report   as well as by many job seekers.  In a somewhat technical discussion, the editorial examines why unemployment remains where it is, and indicates that there is a "glimmer of hope for the jobless:" And here, at last, there is a glimmer of hope for the jobless. GDP growth may be accelerating and may move above 5 percent for the next two quarters. If it does, there will surely be a whole lot more jobs, especially in the labor-intensive service sector.   What's to be done? Not much, for now. No fiscal stimulus is possible, and the administration has already overdone its tax cuts. The only source of macroeconomic support will come from the Federal Reserve Board. It should keep short-term interest rates low and make sure rates for 10 years and longer don't spike any more. This, then, is the opinion of Mortimer B. Zuckerman.

        urlLink President Bush Marks National Small Business Week    In his weekly radio address to the nation, President Bush praised small business owners (emphasis mine): Every day, millions of Americans put in long hours building businesses of their own. Their hard work strengthens the economy,  creates most of the new jobs in America , and supplies the innovation that drives our future prosperity. As we mark National Small Business Week, our nation honors the enterprise and hard work of small business owners and employees.  Small businesses are a key to upward mobility, particularly for women and minorities. There are over 3 million minority-owned small businesses across America, and that number is rising. And women-owned businesses now employ more than 9 million Americans. For the sake of all small businesses and our entire economy, my administration is pursuing an aggressive pro-growth,  pro-jobs  agenda.  The tax relief I have signed since I took office will save 25 million small business owners an average of more than $2,800 this year. Income tax relief is particularly helpful for business owners who pay their business taxes at their individual income tax rates.  We have reduced the burden of unnecessary regulation on small businesses, and we have passed much needed incentives for investment and new equipment, which will help our small businesses grow and  create high-paying jobs .  These policies are working. A recent survey of small businesses shows rising optimism among owners, evidence of improving sales, and  more plans to invest and hire new workers . This is good news for our communities and  good news for people looking for work . The President then continues, "Still, there is more to be done. I have proposed a six-point plan to  create jobs , strengthen small businesses and build employer confidence."  Let's hear it for the small business owners and their employees!

       More Readers' Comments   Sandra posted a comment to  urlLink last week's post about Interviewers' Pet Peeves : I think that employers are overly-scrutinizing prospective employees in this day and time. The fact that recruiters have access to their potential employees whole life history is a violation of personal freedom. Criminal backround checks, for example, should notify the employer if the person is a murderer, a bank robber, or a rapist. In light of technological advances, an employer may look at a minor offense on the prospective employee's record as a reflection of the way that person is, no matter if they have changed or not.  I think employers should be trained to be more empathetic when making a decision on whether or not to hire. I also think that employers shouldn't have the right to inspect a person's history that isn't relevant to the future job. For example, if a rapist applies for a job taking care of people, the answer of course would be "no". If a bank robber applies for as a cashier, the answer again: "no". However, if a person who has a history of drunken driving applies for a job as a janitor then the fact that the drunken driving record has no relevance to the job applied for then the history sould be taken note on but shouldn't interfere with the chance of getting the job, unless of course the job involves driving, if the person hasn't been through some sort of rehabilitation.

        urlLink Staying Networked    Here's an article that offers some tips on how to keep your network alive.  This is good advice for any aspect of business or -- if I can reach a little bit -- life in general.  I touched on this a little yesterday, but I found the words of another to add to it: What a lot of people don’t recognize, until they are faced with a job search, is that it pays to  stay networked  —particularly in good times, when you don’t feel the need as much to keep in touch. Staying networked on a regular basis will put you steps ahead of everyone else who has not remained connected when it comes time for a job search or getting the information or resources you need. In the meantime, too, you'll probably find some way to help someone else along the way.  It's hard for me to pinpoint exact instances in which this blog has helped someone get a job, but I know that you're out there reading it.  When I started it in July 2002 my intention was to find information that would be helpful to me in my own job search and then share it with others via this "network."  Anyhow... go read the article already! ;)

       Effective Networking: Some of the Rules Have Changed   I'm a firm believer that Networking is one of the most vital aspects to searching for a job.  I also believe that it needs to extend beyond the job search and into one's live in general.  Even after obtaining a new job, I still recognize the value of keeping in touch with old business contacts.  You never know when something you know or have may be beneficial to someone else, and vice versa.  Still, effective networking is different today than it was some years ago.  The old techniques no longer work.  In his article " urlLink Handy Hints for the Smart Job-Seeker " for Businessweek Online, Michael Laskoff discusses these differences with some tips for effective networking.

        urlLink Laid-off take survival jobs to pay the bills    USA Today reports that "more workers who find themselves unemployed are turning to survival jobs, taking hourly or part-time work to make ends meet as the economic rebound drags on."  The link above contains several anecdotes from individuals who have done this.  Also mentioned is the employment site  urlLink SnagAJob , which has just earned a spot on the blogroll, once I figure out what happened to my ability to add to the Jobs blogroll.

       How's It Going?   I've been browsing some other folks' blogs, and I've noticed that two of the folks on my blogroll (not the one for this blog, but for the  urlLink others ) are looking for work.  One lives in  urlLink England , and the other lives in Denmark.   urlLink Rasmus, the fellow from Denmark , writes: I seriously and without a doubt need some extra income. I'm not at the point, where I'm seriously considering the many offers, I recieve by spam-mail, but almost! This got me to start thinking about different things I've done to raise money and other odd jobs I've had.  I remember, in 1998, I had a technical interview at a local restaurant just after having donated plasma.  I had the bandage wrap and everything.  I had been trying to get a job at this consulting company, and I think that the interviewer might have simply had pity on me, having seen the extent I went to get money.  Whatever the case, I got the job.  In college I responded to an ad in the campus newspaper from a downtown department store looking for folks to play Santa during the Christmas season.  Yes, Virginia, I was Santa Claus! (chuckles to self)  What are some things you have done to get a job or produce income for yourself?

       The Commute   I read in a recent copy of the  urlLink Dayton Business Journal  that the Dayton area is one of the best areas in the country as far as commuting times is concerned.  I also recall hearing that Atlanta is one of the worst.  Commuting distance is definitely something to consider in your job search.  Relocation may or may not be feasible, and the total amount of travel time during the day can be prohibitive in some cases.  Or not.  Not since I was in college have I had a job where I didn't need to drive at least a half hour to work.  It was great to take the bus where I needed to go and not have to pay attention to traffic, etc.  For my first job out of college, I travelled one hour one way to work for almost three years.  When I got a consulting job, we moved halfway between the consulting territory, yet I still had assignments that meant at least a 40-minute commute.  Of course, if you work from home or telecommute, your commuting time is only the time from the bedroom to the office or wherever you do your work!

       Keeping in Touch   In general I think I've done a poor job in keeping in touch with people from high school, college, and former workplaces.  Yet I'm beginning to see some changes to that, thanks to the ability to develop and maintain a web presence.  The most recent example follows.  I recently posted something about one of my former college classmates in my blog " urlLink Journey Inside My Mind ."  The  urlLink post refers to a band he was the drummer for, called "Deus Ex Machina."   I checked that blog's referrer logs, and I saw that someone did a Google Search for his name.  I wondered if he had done the search on himself (I do this sometimes, too.), and thought that maybe I could track him down if he has any other internet presence.  It turned out that he does.  He's a drummer for a different band now, called " urlLink Chrome ."  I sent him a quick email, and I look forward to his reply.

       More news about the job market   I just finished reading  urlLink this article from the Business section of USA Today .  Most of it contains information I've already mentioned here, yet there are some unique aspects that still deemed it worthy of a link here.  As I read the article, I found myself trying to look between the lines to see where and how the information conveyed helps me as a job seeker (Even though I currently have a job, I still find myself wanting to behave as though I'm still looking, albeit not as aggressively.).  How does this same information I've read before affect my job search in the short term and long term?  I used to work for an IT consulting company.  I now work at a hotel as a bartender.  I like the change, but more specifically, I like that I'm making money to help support my family.  I was willing to take this job, even though I don't get paid the same income I had as a consultant.  One thing I know the condition of the economy and job market has affected me is that I've had to seriously examine the kind of work I used to do and ask myself if I wanted to continue down that path or pursue something different.  I think that a number of individuals are in the same situation.  So, read the USA Today article with a grain of salt, and use what you learn to help you figure out what you can do to improve your job situation.  As always, comments are welcome and appreciated!

       U.S. Labor Department Announces Grants to Promote Women in Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Occupations  WASHINGTON, Oct. 1 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The U.S. Department of Labor today announced $1 million in grants to benefit women entering nontraditional occupations. The grants will go to 10 community-based organizations, which will help employers and labor unions recruit, train, hire and retain women in apprenticeship and nontraditional jobs.  "This Administration is committed to helping women learn about the opportunities available and the fields of work, where long-term careers can be realized," said Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao. "From carpentry to masonry, more and more women are putting in long hours of training or retraining, and taking pride in the fact that their work is helping to make America greater."  The Women in Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Occupations grantees are: Oregon Tradeswomen, Inc., Portland, Oregon; Tradeswomen, Inc., Oakland, California; Women in Non-Traditional Employment Roles, Long Beach, California; Nontraditional Employment for Women, New York, New York; Women's Resource Center, Grand Rapids, Michigan; Montana Job Training Partnership, Helena, Montana; HRC, Inc., Wasilla, Alaska; Northern New England Tradeswomen, Inc., Essex Junction, Vermont; Chicago Women in Trades, Chicago, Illinois; and Area Resources for Community and Human Services, St. Louis, Missouri.  The Women's Bureau administers the grants with the Labor Department's Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer and Labor Services.

This application was the most recent one I'd worked on last winter, and I didn't realize it was a dream until after I woke up.  I guess that's usually how it happens, huh?  One thing interesting about it was that I was using the computer used by another client manager from a project I'd worked on several years ago.  I guess this stays true to the tagline of my other blog, " urlLink Journey Inside My Mind ":  My dreams are weirder than yours.

       Worst Jobs You've Ever Had   I suppose that it's not uncommon for anyone to take a job that, for whatever reason, becomes like a "thorn in the flesh."  Sometimes these jobs are necessary just to make ends meet; one might even call them "survival jobs."  These jobs are are the ones that, long after leaving them, we often reflect on them and say, "That was one of the worst jobs I've ever had."   urlLink Rasmus  recently started a new job, and he's mentioned that the work schedule is placing a heavy burden on his ability to stay up with his ability to succeed at school: I have a simple job: Wipe that desk, vacuum this floor, clean this bathroom. Anyone can do it and the pay is fair. But six hours five days a week is affecting my schoolwork. I'm not home 'til midnight, and though I'm extremely tired, I still need an hour or so to settle down. At school, I'm so tired, I can hardly finish a sentence, much less listen to what anyone else have to say, and doing projects is out of the question. It's not working. His experience reminded me of a job I had as a security guard while in college.  I initially took the job because I would have time to sit and do homework.  But I soon realized that it would be an extreme test of endurance and stamina.  After a full day of school on Friday, which began at 7 AM, I went to a part-time job at a hardware store from 5 PM to 9 PM.  Immediately after that, I went to my security post, and I worked from 11 PM to 11 AM on Saturday  By the time I returned home, I'd been awake for almost 29 hours straight.  All I could do was sleep until I had to wake up to go back to the 11 PM to 11 AM thing from Saturday night to Sunday morning.  I had a different post that I would go to from about 11:30 PM Sunday night through 8:30 AM Monday.  While I learned a lot about myself during this time, I'd still have to say that it was one of the worst jobs I've ever had.  >> What about   you  ?  What are some of the  worst  jobs   you've   ever had?  (No company names, please.)  You can leave your comments here or send me an email at danimal0416 at yahoo dot com.

       Seasonal Employment, Part 1   We've been slowly unpacking the rest of our stuff.  I say 'we', but I really mean my wife Jennie.  One of the items she found is fond reminder of a job I had at Christmastime while in college.  A clipping from the December 24, 1993 front page of the Cincinnati Enquirer contains a photo of me.  The caption under the photo reads as follows: Dan Johnson, Jr., a senior at the University of Cincinnati, helps Logan Abner, 2, put money into the [Salvation Army] kettle at the Madeira Kroger store Thursday.  Johnson plays the saxophone to lure donations. The photo was taken by Glenn Hartong, and it shows me bundled up, wearing a Santa cap, with my alto saxophone hanging from my neck, helping Logan put his coins into the kettle.  I remember that job fondly.  I needed it to have money for rent and stuff.  The folks at the Madeira Kroger warmly welcomed my music.  Every so often, as I would get cold, I'd go inside for a break.  The crew of cashiers would ask me to play "O Holy Night" for them.  I did, and everyone applauded.  I was grateful to be able to cheer them up.  I also recall being encouraged by one of my friends' mom.  I actually knew her because she took a class with me in college.  She lived in Madeira, and once, on her way out of the store, she handed me a cookie and cup of hot chocolate.  How very thoughtful!  I read in this past Sunday's classifieds that the Salvation Army is looking for talented musicians to man their kettles again this year.  It something to consider.    crossposted to  urlLink Journey Inside My Mind

       Change One Thing...   Mike over at  urlLink _monk  recently reflected on his career change.  At first he thought his time in his earlier career was a waste, but then he concludes: then i realized, without the background in business i wouldn't be who i am. i prob would not appreciate what a great job teaching is and would prob not be as effective of a teacher (to the degree i am effective). as anyone who has ever wrote a computer program or read about chaos theory (or seen a bad sci-fi movie) knows changing one small thing in a complex system (such as life) often has wide reaching and unexpected consequences...

        urlLink Interview Tricks Are No Treat    This past Saturday I mentioned that  urlLink employers are using psychological testing in the interviewing process .  Basically, I think it's best to do your best and be honest during them, since it's really hard to prepare for them.  Not quite the case for the typical interviewing questions, however.  I had mentioned the "What is your biggest weakness?" one.  Then today I spotting this MSN Careers article with some advice on how to prepare for this and other tough interviewing questions:  urlLink Interview Tricks Are No Treat

        urlLink Psychological Tests Becoming Big at Work    A recent study states that one in three employers is using these tests in the hiring process.   urlLink ABCNews has the details...   And here's a quote from the article: Long popular in Europe, the tests are now becoming more common among U.S. and multi-national firms keen on determining what kind of workers their employees are, how well they'll get a long with others and whether or not they're suited for a particular job. Some other headings in the article include   Top to the Bottom Testing , which talks about how these tests are being administered for CEO candidates as well as sales associates for a retail chain;  Seeking the Emotionally Intelligent , which describes how tests are being done to assess a candidates disposition and how he or she may work with others;  The Writing's on the Application , which shares how some companies are using handwriting analysis to "help weed out applicants who might be untrustworthy, or to hire people who have qualities like integrity or reliability." For the job seeker this presents some challenges.  When I went through job outplacement, I was taught how to answer interviewing questions in a way that would project a positive impression of myself to the interviewer.  For example, one of the common questions was about my biggest weakness.  The way to answer this question is to talk about a weakness and turn it into a potential strength.  I would think that the best strategy for these psychological tests is to be completely honest in answering the questions.  Trying to answer a question based on what you think the employer wants to hear may not be in your best interest.  In addition, it's difficult to discern how a potential employer will use the results of such tests.  They may perceive answers to questions differently from how you do, for example.  Just be honest and do your best.

       Five Myths About Holiday Job Hunting    via an emailed newsletter from  urlLink Execs-Direct.com      by Sinara Stull O'Donnell   When I was an executive and a corporate recruiter, I found that December was my busiest and most stressful month. It's no exaggeration to say I often made job offers on Christmas Eve and came in the day after Christmas to do the paperwork so that an employee could start Jan. 2.  Yet, the misconception that nobody hires in December is common, as is the poor advice that "you might as well take the month off." It may seem counterintuitive, but the opposite is true.  Holiday job-search myths have been around for a long time and are repeated like mantras, but shatter when scrutinized. Consider the following:   Myth No.1: "Nobody hires in December"   December is still a month employees are being paid to work. There are five reasons companies may hire in December:  Many companies must spend the money in their budgets before the end of the year. Hiring "heats up in December because hiring managers are trying to reach deadlines to use budgets," says Susie Basanda, principal of Basanda Consulting, a recruitment management company in Ventura County, Calif. People tend to want to tie up loose ends before the new year. Hiring managers, human-resource representatives and executive recruiters are like the rest of us who have that feeling of urgency as the year-end approaches. If there are unfilled positions on their staffs, hiring managers naturally want to fill them. Positions open up in late November or early December because many professionals quit their jobs this time of year. As David Knowles, a senior recruiter with Excel Unlimited, an executive search firm in Houston, says, "The holidays can bring on a time of longing to be closer to family, roots and people. If no bonus is involved, people often will quit Dec. 1, and give two weeks notice so that they can be with family for the holidays." Headhunters are more motivated to place candidates before the end of the year. Almost all executive recruiters are paid on commission. This commission is based on fees their company earns for placing professionals. What helps the December job seeker is that this commission rises based on overall yearly billing. One might start the year at 30% and graduate to 60% by December. The catch is that it goes down to 30% again Jan. 1. Strong companies often want to start the new year with a bang. "Companies that are forecasting profits want to have key people in place to start the year off well," says Knowles.  Myth No. 2: "You won't find the job you really want in December"   You're just as likely to find the job you really want in December as in any other month. One reason is because you won't have as much competition, says Judy Kneisley, senior vice president and general manager for outplacement firm Lee Hecht Harrison Inc. "Because so many people believe in the myths, it's a perfect time to be out there," she says. It may sound logical that only losers would be desperate enough to look for jobs during the holidays, says Knowles, but "the fact is that winners are looking in December." Winners don't give up.   Myth No. 3: "Nothing ever happens after Dec. 15, so you might as well leave town"   Most recruiters advise job candidates to be flexible in scheduling interviews and meetings around the holidays. Eberhart goes a step further and advises candidates to avoid taking weeklong trips during the holidays. Basanda once held a round of interviews New Year's Day.    Myth No. 4: "Even if an employer has an opening, the hiring manager won't have time to meet with you"   The interviewing process can be slower during the holidays because of the number of days people are out of the office. But, as Basanda says, the process "will slow down but it doesn't stop."   Myth No. 5: "You'll have a better chance if you wait until the first of the year"   If employers have a need, they don't care whether it's January or December. "[Hiring] isn't focused on the time of year. It's focused on need," says Keith Mills, vice president for Aaron's Automotive, a manufacturer in Springfield, Mo.    Ms. O'Donnell is a free-lance writer and a career consultant in Springfield, Mo. This article was abridged from  urlLink CareerJournal.com .

       Advice From Successful Job Seekers: Don't Neglect Your Network  by Caroline Levchuck (via  urlLink My Yahoo! Daily Tip )  Curtis Potter wasn't even actively seeking full-time work when he was appointed creative director of an advertising agency. He credits his new job to his solid professional network.   Potter had left his most recent job on good terms and had stayed in touch with his boss when he moved cross-country.   "I would visit whenever I went back to the West Coast and have dinner with him when he came to New York," said Potter.   Potter also built a strong network in and around New York City.   "A former colleague from a local agency called me and told me about the opening, and I sent my resume in. She talked me up to her bosses and they reviewed my resume. It turned out that they knew my previous employer," said Potter.   "I had two strong references going for me -- a former colleague and a former boss. The agency interviewed tons of people, but I think these connections made all the difference," said Potter. This is great news.

       Job Hunting Success Story   Sue T. responded to  urlLink a recent post  and shared her job hunting success story: Cheers !!!   I finally got a job!!   I got my job through a website called  urlLink www.jobs.net .   I was doing my daily job search at my local workforce one in Florida, and I stumbled across this website, which I'd never heard of before. I decided to check this site out, and I found a position called yacht finance specialist (a.k.a administrative assistant). The funny thing about this position was it posted on August 18, 2003, and it was still on their site on November 12, 2003. I called the employer, and the reason why they did not find anyone was because none of the other candidates had passed the credit check. The company is owned by a bank, and passing a credit check is required.  In the post to which Sue responded, we posed some specific questions.  Below we've listed the questions along with her answers.   What position were you applying for?  Administrative Assistant  How did you contact the particular company?  I called the company and then faxed them my resume  Describe the interviewing process.  It was pretty simple.  They were only interested in me because they had already posted this position on  urlLink careerbuilder.com  and had not yet found anyone qualified for it.  Did you work part-time or as a contractor/consultant with the company before being hired?  No  How long was the process from your first contact with the company to your first day of work?  I interviewed for the position on November 18th.  I returned on December 1st and was hired after I found out I passed the credit check.  Describe your emotional state during the process. Were you anxious? Excited? Stressed? Impatient? Frustrated? Let us know.  I kept wondering why the credit check was taking so long.

       urlLink VistaPrint Free Business Cards   When you're out networking for your next job contact, it's a good idea to have a personal business card handy.  One method I've seen which is particularly interesting is to include sort of a mini-resume - some bulleted highlights of your specific job skills or areas of expertise.  The essentials to include on a networking business card include: Name Phone Email address Web site (where hopefully a description of your talents and your resume can be found) Depending on your area of expertise, including a title or functional area might also be a good idea (i.e. Marketing Professional, Quality Specialist, Technical Consultant, etc.).  Re: the above noted URL, VistaPrint offers "free" business cards for the cost of shipping only (about $5), but these cards do include a text ad for vistaprint on the back.   You can also print up cards on your personal printer (ok as long as you have a real paper cutter - the perforated edges on preprinted business card stock a la  urlLink Paper Direct  is sort of tacky), or check out your local Kinko's or Mailboxes Etc for low cost card printing options.

       urlLink Dice.com - Job search for Technology Professionals  Today, I read through my automated job search agent for DICE.com, and found no less than 5 job postings by recruiters for the SAME JOB.  5 out of 21 jobs returned works out to roughly 25% of my time wasted reading the same job description.  The thing that I've learned about many of these recruiter posts is that if you do a little bit of research, often you can find the employer on the web and apply for the job directly.  Since recruiters charge a fairly hefty percentage for their services, it makes me wonder whether employers are using them at all these days, or if they give preference to candidates that come to them directly, without the extra price tag.  This is not to say that I haven't found jobs through recruiters in the past - just that in today's market, I'm wondering whether they are still of any use...

       Why? A simple question   a post from the  urlLink Occupational Adventure (sm) Blog    I should preface this post with an explanation that I am a  urlLink Passion Catalyst  (sm) - in short, I help people identify their passions and create careers that ignite them.   When it comes to finding your passion in your career, there's no way around it. Self-exploration is where it all starts.   Want a short, simple way to squeeze exponentially more insights from those self-exploration efforts? The secret word o' the day is...  "Why?"  Just that one little word, vigorously applied, will give you incredible insights.   For example, take a look at a commonly recommended question for finding your career passion..."What do you love doing?"   A valuable question, but by itself it falls far short of the insights that could be gotten by following the answers up with, "why?"   Because "what" you love doing isn't the whole story. You can say, "I love doing _____," but whether you're conscious of it or not, what you really mean is "I love doing _____ because _____, _____, and _____." You and I could say we love the exact same thing, and the underlying reasons might be completely different.   Asking "Why? What is it about it that is so enjoyable?" lets you dig down and find the underlying characteristics of the things you love doing. Once you know those, you can start trying to incorporate them into your career, whether by making small changes where you are, or identifying a whole new direction.

       urlLink Job Search Tracking - Keeping It All Straight     Does anyone else remember a time when you send in a resume and literally count the minutes between the time it was sent and the phone ringing?  Well, back in the day, it was just not as difficult to track the old job search.  A binder, a spreadsheet, even your Sent Mail folder would do.  When I embarked upon my most recent job search, just over a year ago, I realized that none of these methods were quite right. I kept bookmarking job descriptions on the big job boards, only to go back later to find they had been removed. In order to better track the specifics of the jobs I was applying to, I ended up developing a very simple web-based job tracking system where I could store all of the job related information in one place (including the resume and cover letter I sent it), and retrieve it on demand.  After using the application for several months, I turned it into a free public job portal so that anyone can use it.   With all of the job related web sites out there, I'm surprised that no one has done this until now.  The closest thing I've seen has been on private career center sites which provide some job search tools for their paid clientele.  Other than that, there are some sites that let you track the jobs you applied to through their interface, but none of them let you track all of your job inquiries, regardless of source.  If you've seen anything else like it out there, please let me know.  Also, if you'd like to share how you're tracking your current job search, please add a comment below.

        urlLink Should You Tell Your Employer That You Have AD/HD?    The  urlLink previous post  is one of many examples that show that having ADHD affects how one performs in the workplace.  This article explains, with specific examples, that it may or may not be in one's best interest to disclose to an employer: The answer is, it depends on the facts of the individual case. Generally, we recommend disclosure of AD/HD to an employer if (1) you can document AD/HD, and AD/HD is a disability under the law in your case, (2) you are qualified for the job, and (3) you need job accommodations that are reasonable. The writers share instances when you should not disclose ADHD along with when and how to disclose.

The entire guide is available for downloading as a  urlLink PDF file , too. The symptoms of AD/HD create special challenges for the adult in the workplace, just as they do for the child in school. To date, very little research has been conducted that provides adults with AD/HD empirically-based approaches to understanding and coping with workplace issues. Until scientifically-based guidelines are available, it may prove useful to follow the procedures commonly used by career counselors to guide individuals in selecting a job and coping with AD/HD on the job. This information and resource sheet will:  offer tips for improving on-the-job functioning describe the rights of individuals under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provide guidelines for making career choices  The assistance of a career counselor or a psychologist, social worker, or other health care worker with career counseling training is extremely helpful in understanding and maximizing these factors.

        urlLink Jobs Growth in Nov. Slower Than Expected    While that doesn't sound too encouraging by itself, I'd like to point to these paragraphs from the article: The jobs market has been a weak link in the recovery, with companies hesitant to hire new, full-time workers out of concern that the improvements wouldn't last. Instead, employers worked their employees longer and harder, sending productivity to a two-decade high last quarter.    In Friday's jobs report, the services sector continued to drive employment gains, with health care and social services jumping by 25,000 in November. Hotels and lodging facilities created 13,000 new positions. Hiring also occurred in education, government and professional and business services.    In the goods-producing category, construction employment was up last month by 10,000. Articles such as these are meant to describe overall trends, from a macroeconomic perspective.  Jobs are available, and your particular circumstances may or may not be affected by what's reported nationally.  Go Get That Job!

       Wanted:  Your  Job Hunting Success Stories   However it is that you got to this weblog, I'm encouraged that you've stopped by.  Hopefully, you'll find what you're looking for.  Now, let me take this moment to ask you for something.  I want to let others know about how you have successfully found a job.  This may sound odd, especially if you're currently between jobs.  Nevertheless, you probably have had a job before, and I (and I'm sure that many others) would like to know how you got it.  It may be your current one or a previous one - it doesn't matter. I want to  encourage  other job seekers with your success. You will receive no reimbursement from this, except for the gratification that your story has helped to inspire countless others who are where you once were.  Be specific, but don't mention any company names. That may sound like a contradiction in terms, and you may disagree with this approach - let me know and I may reconsider. Instead, use a generic title, such as "software development consulting company", "global consumer products company", and so on. If you would like some help, then let me know.  I will only use your initials or first name and last initial when presenting your success story. I am specifically interested in answers to the following:  What position were you applying for? How did you contact the particular company? Describe the interviewing process. Did you work part-time or as a contractor/consultant with the company before being hired? How long was the process from your first contact with the company to your first day of work? Describe your emotional state during the process. Were you anxious? Excited? Stressed? Impatient? Frustrated? Let us know.   So email me your job hunting success stories at danimal0416[nospam]@yahoo.com(remove the [nospam], of course), and we'll get them published here at "Get That Job!"  Thanks!

        urlLink WetFeet.com > How to Answer Resume-Based Questions    Recruiters love to ask all candidates, from undergraduates to mid-career, about their resume. These questions give an interviewer a chance to dig a little deeper into your background and at the same time test your critical thinking abilities. The questions also give you a chance to show the interviewer your confidence, competence, and enthusiasm about a project or job you really understand.  Because resume questions take the discussion to your home turf, there isn't really a secret recipe for pulling apart the question. The way to be successful here is to follow a few basic interview rules.

        urlLink MSN Careers - Believe It or Not! - Career Advice Article    How far would you go to land your next job? For most, it depends on how badly they need a job. As a career counselor, I've had the opportunity to hear about many amazing and often outrageous stories involving people employing extreme strategies to find suitable work. Many of the stories may sound unbelievable to you, but they are all true...  ...This is what happened to six people desperate for work and at their wits' end. These stories are about regular people just like you and me who took control of their destiny to achieve a goal.   Although these stories are intriguing and highly creative, I do not recommend following these examples as a means of finding employment. They provide the kind of "out-of-the-box" thinking required for becoming employed in a tough job market. I hope you will glean from them the inspiration to escape the anxiety of being in transition and instead devote your energies to a creative self-marketing that goes beyond the pages of a resume...

       5 Things to do with all that extra time:    Being unemployed may suck financially, but it does have its advantages in terms of all of that extra free time it creates.  You could spend the next couple of months couch surfing, or here are some other things you can do with your free time:  1.  urlLink Learn to Cook  - there are cooking classes, cookbooks, and my personal favorite, the  urlLink food network  with all sorts of cooking shows like  urlLink Iron Chef ,  urlLink 30 Minute Meals ,  urlLink Food 911 ,  urlLink Date Plate  , and  urlLink the Naked Chef with Jamie Oliver (why is it they pick the hunkiest hosts for these shows?  Cute men that can actually cook?  Woohoo!), you're bound to find something that appeals to your "inner chef"!  2.  urlLink Exercise Your Body : you don't have to join a gym to get out and get some exercise!  Pick your favorite activity, or something that you've always wanted to learn, and get on a schedule, joing a group, or take a class to improve your skills.  3.  urlLink Exercise Your Mind : Learn something new, take a class, read a book, get certified, write your memoirs, anything is good as longs as it exercises your mind! 4.  urlLink Get Organized ! Whether it's  urlLink organizing your house ,  urlLink your life  or your  urlLink job search , it's never too late to make a fresh start at getting organized (and staying that way!)  5.  urlLink Volunteer   If you have any other suggestions for this list, please add a comment!

       Tip of the Day: Blog your way to Job Search success!   (Original post is located  urlLink here .)  While there are many blogging tools out there, I find that I have become very fond of the free   urlLink BLOGGER  service for most of my blogging needs, ever since  urlLink Google   acquired them and added the Blog button to the  urlLink Google Toolbar .  What this does is allow you to add web pages, with comments, directly to your blog from whatever site you are on with the push of a button.  For example, suppose you see a job listing in your local newsgroup.   The logical thing to do would be to go to the employer's site and see whether or not the job is listed there.  Now here's where Blogging can come in handy.  Say you are ready to apply for the job immediately - it's easy enough just to send in your resume and store all of the information in your Jobfiler job tracker.  But suppose you aren't ready to apply - you need to revise your resume, or get your cover letter in order, or simply think about it.  If you had a job search related Blog, you would simply blog that page, add whatever notes you want to associate with that job, and post it to your blog.  Your blog would then become a running job search diary, which you can even add follow up comments to any single entry.  Some things to consider...  if you are blogging your job search for your own records, it's important to set up the blog as PRIVATE (not publically available).  Of course, there are folks who blog their search publically, but that's really a judgement call on your part.  Anything you post in the public domain could come back to bite you.  Read this article on Blogger about the guy that got fired over his blog.   How-To's (skip this if you're not trying to set your blog to Private) When you  urlLink create your account on Blogger  , you can specify whether the blog is public or private. If you mark it as "Private" and want to keep it that way, you should also add the robots meta tag in the header of your template (and if you FTP to your own directory, placing the robots.txt file in the root is also a good idea).  And of course, set your options on Blogger to Ping Weblogs = No.  Here are some sample jobsearch blogs which I have found on the web:  urlLink Trey's Job Search   urlLink All About Jen   urlLink Mike McBride: Life of a one-man IT Department   On a related note, here are some jobsearch information blogs, offering advice, articles, etc.  urlLink The Job Files   urlLink http://bostonworks.boston.com/blog/   urlLink Not Working for a Living   urlLink The Monster Blog   urlLink Being Bold   And for those of you who would like an alternative solution to Blogger, here are some other ways to get your blog up and running in a short amount of time:  urlLink BBlog   urlLink Square Space   urlLink eBloggy   Good luck, and happy hunting!

        urlLink BW Online | December 2, 2003 | U.S. Programmers at Overseas Salaries    He could have used subcontractors in India, but he decided to keep the work at home but at the same price.  Jon Carson's cMarket  has solved its immediate challenge, the implications of Jon's approach are potentially mind-bending. What if other companies begin taking the same approach -- offering Indian-style wages to American workers? On the positive site, we could begin to solve our job-creation problems. But on the negative side, America's standard of living would inevitably decline. There's only one way to find out for sure how it all might shake out, and that is for other executives to replicate Jon's experiment. The results could be quite interesting.

Have a gnawing feeling that your accountant may be cooking the books and pocketing cash?   Well, if you're in Bangkok, you can call on a new company that uses lie detectors, or polygraphs, to confirm the claims of potential employees or insure that workers are being honest.  I believe this is illegal in the United States, however.

       urlLink Right Job, Wrong Job - Personality test to find the right career for you   Tickle, by eMode, is a social networking web site that is chock full of personality tests (like what kind of dog you would be if you were a dog, of course), including this one on finding the career that's right for you.  The career test does return your personality type, although it wasn't as specific as I expected it to be. For example, it told me that I should get a job that allows me to be Analytical and Creative (no surprise there), but didn't tell me specifically which jobs fit that bill.  Apparently, to get a list of jobs, I would have to request (purchase) their Personalized Career Report for $14.95.  So, while the site can be a kick (and a break from the day-to-day of your job search), I don't recommend giving them a dime.  Unless of course, you're just looking to squander some money on the web (then, boy, do I have some web sites for you!) ;-p

       urlLink CAREERS NOW: ORGANIZE HUNT WITH NEW FREE SERVICE   Jobfiler was mentioned today by syndicated columnist, Joyce Lain Kennedy in her "Careers Now" column. Kennedy has been an authority on employment for the last three decades. Her Q&A column provides advice on jobs and career development, addressing common work-related problems: demotion, layoffs, discrimination, specialization, keeping up with technology and networking at trade conventions.   Here is an excerpt from what Joyce had to say about Jobfiler.com:     NEW FREE ORGANIZER . A hard-charging job search generates scores of contacts each week. Effective follow-up depends upon keeping your records straight - contacts, names, dates, pitches, interviews, thank-you notes, previous follow-up and so forth. Accessible records help you maintain memory of resources where you've had better than average success - somewhat like finding a store that carries clothing you like and where you want to return to shop.  Until now, books with blank worksheets to photocopy were the norm. No more. I've been keeping an eye peeled for a free online and public tool (not a tool restricted to clients of outsourcing consultants or for-fee Web sites). Happily, such a tool has materialized:  urlLink Jobfiler.com .

        urlLink Yahoo! News - Consumer Sentiment Highest Since Nov 2000    I think I understand it now.  Evidence shows that the tax cuts passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush have been good for the economy and job seekers.  As consumer sentiment gets better, the demand for goods and services grows.  The higher demand for goods and services means that companies work to provide for those demands.  This means investing money into hiring new workers, for one thing.  From the article (emphasis added): The confidence data helped ease worries that the labor market's slow recovery might undermine consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds of economic activity in the United States.   Consumers' hearty spending over the past few years, helped by  tax cuts  and low interest rates, has  helped keep the economy from suffering a sharper downturn .   Economists said a variety of factors likely boosted confidence: the holidays passing without any attacks, the rise in stock indexes to nearly two-year highs,  coming tax refunds  and an end to big layoffs.

        "I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up."    I made that statement yesterday at a gathering of other job seekers at  urlLink Sinclair Community College .  A brief history of my education and experience:  I have a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering I was an Environmental Engineer doing environmental management for a manufacturing company I was a programmer/consultant I am a bartender for a hotel and conference center I remember when I met with the guidance counselor in high school, he told me that he could see me doing a number of different kinds of jobs, based on the talents and aptitude he'd seen in me.  I had dreamed of becoming a Renaissance Man back then.  I don't know if I've found something that fits just yet.  To quote  urlLink U2 , "I still haven't found what I'm looking for."  At the same time, I realize that no job is going to be a perfect fit.  There are always going to be times when the passion wanes, when there is other "non-fun" work to be done, too.  I guess it's a matter of seeing whether the benefits outweigh the costs, evaluating the trade-offs.  For example, I have a friend who designs cars for a major automobile company.  He loves that part of his job so much that he is able to live with the long hours and the long drive to and from work.  I guess I want to find something in-between, too.    crossposted to  urlLink Journey Inside My Mind

"While online job boards have become popular, they rarely work for job seekers, and hiring managers are overwhelmed with resumes and “cold” emails from strangers.

       2004 in (p)review   It's the time of year when we focus on New Year's resolutions. I came across an approach that Mel at Mystic Musings takes that I really like. Rather than list all the things she needs to do better in the coming year, she projects herself to the end of the year and  urlLink makes a list  of all the great things she did. The year in review...or maybe that should be the year in preview.   I gave it a try  urlLink myself  on my blog. It was an interesting experience, and definitely feels more positive than "I'm going to do this, this, and this better this year." In a way, stating each of the things in the past tense went a long way towards making them more real.     urlLink The Occupational Adventure (sm) Blog

        urlLink Don't ever stop your networking    [another Marvin Walberg article]  The main point of this article is that you should constantly network instead of relying on "911 Networking," the kind that often occurs when someone loses a job.  Walberg recommends a book by Diane Darling, entitled The Networking Survival Guide.  I've added it to my list of favorite books so that I'll know to check it out later (I maintain a list of what I'm currently reading via  urlLink AllConsuming.net , and you can view the list at my homepage, " urlLink Dan's Domain .").  Constant networking may mean that jobs come looking for you.

       When You Don't Know Anybody   What if you recently moved to a new city or town and don't know anybody with whom to network?  After all, networking is key to getting a job.   urlLink Marvin Walberg  recommends  volunteer work and special interest groups .  I'm not sure whether the link I've referenced above is going to last, so allow me to do some pasting from the article:  Volunteering is a wonderful way to meet new people, demonstrate workplace skills, network like crazy and get the good feeling of helping others. And every community needs volunteers.  How do you find out what's available in the world of volunteering in your city? Go to your main public library, chamber of commerce or any hospital system. You will find a plethora of opportunities, and from a "building your resume" perspective, volunteer work is work and counts in the experience column. It really doesn't matter that you do it for free.  Everyone has interests aside from the workaday world. How about you? Do you like bowling, bird watching, table tennis or wood carving? In most cities you can obtain a listing of special interest groups at your public library.  Understand that networking is universal. Just because someone knows nothing about what you do for a living doesn't mean he or she can't lead you to others who do. Just be prepared to introduce yourself and give a clear, understandable explanation of what you do, or want to do, for a living. Then, show up for meetings and smile. The rest will happen almost automatically.

       Staying Employed While You're Searching for a New Job  Everyone knows it's easier to find a job when you already have one.  So, even if your job is a miserable one, plog away as long as you can while you're looking for something better.  Be smart about how you go about looking for a job, unless you really just don't care whether or not your current employer finds out.  1. If you are searching for jobs on the Internet from your work computer, do yourself a favor and keep your activities private by using a free proxy service like  urlLink The Cloak .  2. Don't use your work email account to send resumes from (I know this sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised how many people do this!), and if you must give out a daytime number, use a cell phone or answering service. 3. Posting your resume online can be tricky, if you don't want your current employer to pull you up in a candidate search.  It's much better to not post your resume publicly, and also be careful about sending in resumes to anonymous employers (yes, I've heard of people sending in resumes for their own jobs - it's not pretty!) 4. Track your job search using portable media, like  urlLink Jobfiler , or a notebook you can carry with you.  That way you don't have records on your work computer which indicate you've been searching. 5. Whatever else you do, don't publicly broadcast your job search in a Blog or Discussion Board posts, unless you are fully prepared for the consequences. People have been fired over less.  Good luck with your job search!

       Insider Information: Good News! Job Search Expenses Are Deductible in the U.S.   By Harry Collias, H&R Block Tax Specialist  Expenses incurred in the course of searching for a new job can be a deduction against your taxable income.  The Internal Revenue Service has laid down some rules and erected at least one hurdle, but the deduction can make a difference in your final tax bill.  Many job seekers are unaware of this tax benefit; here's how you can take advantage of it.  First, the Rules:  You can deduct certain unreimbursed expenses you incur in looking for a new job, whether or not you are unemployed at the time of the job search, and whether or not you land a new job.  You cannot deduct job search expenses if:  You are looking for a job in a new occupation, or  There has been a substantial break between the ending of your last job and your looking for a new one, or  You are looking for a job for the first time.  If you pass the "cannot" rules, then you can deduct  Employment and outplacement agency fees.  Costs of typing, printing, and mailing copies of your resume.  Phone and fax expenses, including long distance calls to prospects.  Travel and transportation expenses if you have to travel outside your home territory to look for, or interview for, a job. The trip must be primarily to look for a job. The term "primarily" refers to the amount of personal activity on the trip compared to the amount of time you spend in looking for work. Even if you cannot justify deduction of travel expenses you can still deduct the expenses of looking for a job while in the area. If you drive you can deduct the standard mileage rate of 36 cents per mile.  Second, the hurdle:  Job search expenses are classified as "miscellaneous itemized deductions." This class of deductions (which include union dues, work clothes, and tax prep fees) is only deductible from your income if you itemize deductions and only to the extent that the total exceeds two percent of your adjusted gross income.  Third, some advice:  Keep detailed records of your expenses, in case of audit, and never include expenses for which you have been reimbursed by your prospective employer.  © Copyright 2004 Harry Collias.

       Who You Are - Self-Assessment, etc.   Today, while looking through some career assessment documents I'd worked on a few years back, I found some characteristics from my Myers-Briggs Type Indicator profile (I'm an ENFJ, by the way):  Natural motivator even when people initially don't want to do something Outwardly focused toward others Highly skilled in understanding others' needs and motivations Gift for imagination and inspiration Expresses himself in organized, effective way that allows him to make his imaginative ventures become reality Identifies what the group needs to help it reach its goal Looked to for leadership and decisiveness in a supportive climate Sincerity and concern are driving force and motivation Highly articulate, with excellent social skills and a quick sense of humor Sizes up a situation intuitively and, in a very caring and concerned way, says just the right thing Communicates organization's values Brings strong ideals of how organizations should treat people Enjoys leading and facilitating teams Encourages cooperation Likes to bring matters to fruitful conclusions Leads through personal enthusiasm Takes a participative stance in managing people and projects Responsive to followers' needs Challenges the organization to make actions congruent with values Inspires change The MBTI is just one of a number of ways that you can learn more about yourself.  What about you?

       Job Search Links   [via email from Mark Carey]   I received this email from Mark Carey recently, and I wanted to pass the information along to fellow job seekers: Hi Dan,  I not applying to become a contributor, as I don't feel that I would be able to meet the "post regularly" rule.  But I do want to let you know of a couple of new web sites that you may want to talk about in your blog:   urlLink Career MetaSearch   -   urlLink http://www.careermetasearch.com  A new job search site that focuses exclusively on employer-only postings (no recruiters).   urlLink Job Search Blogs  -  urlLink http://www.jobsearchblogs.com  Just two days old, this site offers free blogs to job seekers.	I believe that blogs can really act as an extended resume, showing employers a lot more than a boring resume.  A community aspect of the site is planned: an aggregated view of all bloggers' entries in a forum-like view, enabling job seekers to discuss their job search efforts.  I am developing the second site for a client (Career MetaSearch, the first link above).  If you feel that either or both of these sites are worthy of mention, it would be greatly appreciated to help get the word out (addition to your blogroll would be great too, of course :) )  Alternatively, I could write a "one time" article about Job Search Blogs, if that interests you.  Regards,  Mark  Ps.  Great blog! Thanks, Mark, for the information!

       What Career Choices Do ENFJs Make?   ENFJ is one of the sixteen Myers-Briggs Types.  I'm an ENFJ.  For more information on what this means specifically, you can check out this  urlLink web page .  You could also search it in your favorite search engine; there's a Google search utility on this blog, as a matter of fact.  I belong to an ENFJ email group, and the following message was sent out recently:  I am in between jobs and wanted to know what other people do for a living.  I am also very interested in whether you consider this to be your passion or a career or a just a job.  Thanks.  As I began to read the replies, I thought that it would be useful to post them here.  Here's one:  The basic tread of ENFJs is a quest to teach. Even though I don't teach professionally now, I am always learning stuff so I can teach. I did teach classical piano for 15 years but grew to hate it because while I did have good and exceptional students from time to time, most were just being enriched by their wealthy parents.   Below is a list of my life's work experience. Please do not think of me as a jack of all trades and master of none because that is not true. I just get bored after awhile and want something new. I have been blessed with the ability to change professions, for example, after fifteen years in the auto business becoming the top salesman for Ford in New Jersey, New York and PA, I started taking lessons on the piano and went on to a full time career in music.  1.  Movie Usher. 2.  Construction worker. ( Under my father ) 3.  Heavy machinery driver. ( Florida Turnpike ) 4.  Radar Operator US Army. 5.  Radio Operator US Army. 6.  Supply Seargent US Army. 7.  Auto Salesman. 8.  Auto Parts Department Manager. 9.  Auto Service Department Manager. 10.  Auto Sales Manager. 11.  Piano Teacher. 12.  Piano Tuner. 13.  Pianist. 14.  Accountant. 15.  Real Estate Salesman. 16.  Insurance Salesman. 17.  Computer programmer. 18.  Investigator for State Police. 19.  Stock and Bond Investor  Interesting.  Here's another reply:  I'm so drawn to teaching that after only three years of being a High School teacher I've put my hand up for having a prac teacher from the local uni. So now I teach the kids and help a new teacher learn how to teach.  It's quite an addiction!  High School teaching is a passion, but not necessarily a career. Like [a previous person mentioned] I see myself getting itchy in a few years. I've always fancied going off to Bible College and becoming the pastor of a church. But I'm scared my heart will be too much in it, which would be very dangerous if things went poorly.  Yet another ENFJ replies:  My first thought on this subject was "career choice?"  I don't feel that I was able to make a career choice.  I kind of fell into my line of work.  I did extremely well in Office Education in high school (but I probably would have done well in other subjects--it was a VERY small school and there were very few programs available outside of the regular curriculum), and when I needed to make money after I graduated I secured an administrative assistant position at the refinery which was our small town's primary employer.  I worked while I went to the local junior college.  Soon I was married and we moved to a slightly larger town so my husband could attend a university.  Of course, the dutiful wife (I score spades in dutiful), the primary income generation fell to me.  An agency got me an interview with a large bank and after working in various departments I was promoted to receptionist in the trust department, where the Sr. VP and trust officer happened to also be an attorney.  My husband, the gypsy, moved us all over and it seemed that one thing led to another, always working for attorneys, because the work was the highest paying clerical work.  (Meanwhile every attempt of mine to go to college was thwarted by said husband...now my ex!)  And I *was* a very good secretary, anticipating the needs of my bosses (and attorneys are VERY needy), well organized, proficient.  But I was a secretary.  I found it extremely demeaning, because I knew I was capable of so much more.  Now, I find myself LOVING my job at a lawfirm--because I am allowed to be SO MUCH MORE!  I am still a legal secretary, but also a legal technologist, handling the technical needs of the firm.  My goal is for the job to work into full time technology, and I think it is a reasonable assumption that it is just a matter of time.  And believe it or not, I like have the secretarial work when I am experiencing information overload and I need to process or just to do something at which I excel.  I have always been appreciated in my jobs, but I have never felt fulfilled until now.    I have been a "job hopper" because I "still hadn't found what I was looking for" to coin a U2 lyric!  I, and I suspect others of my type (ENFJ), needed variety and to feel that I added unique value.  Now I get to do many different things, have lots to learn, many challenges, and I have found the right environment (jeans, relaxed atmosphere, great coworkers).  I notice that I am learning not to take things personally, that I no longer expect to win every battle and indeed that some things are not battles anyway.  For instance, I asked for business cards, but the firm does not provide business cards to anyone but attorneys and paralegals.  I will just print my own and eventually I'm sure I will get firm cards, I realize they have never had anyone in this position and are not ready to set this precedent.  I think all of the personal growths I am recognizing are really just due to wisdom, which has come with my advancing years.  I don't make top dollar, but thanks to my husband I don't have to anymore.    I know this is way more than you wanted to know, but I've waxed eloquent on other occasions about how dissatisfied I was with my occupation, and I just wanted to share what a great change has occurred.  I still feel that it resulted because of circumstances (which I attribute to God) and I'm so grateful!  I don't think it is bad, obviously, to keep changing and hunting and striving for the ideal.  (That said, I didn't get a lot of interviews due to my poor tenure!)

       Thanks!    urlLink Jen  gave us some encouraging comments recently: I just wanted to commend the creators on a wonderful job with this blog. I graduated from a prestigious university in 2003, spent 6 months job searching before I finally found something that I was content with. Unfortunately that was temporary, and then I ended up with another temp job, and the owner turned out to be a complete psycho (i filed harassment against him, and he hasn't paid me for the last month that I worked -- and it's been 2 months now). Anyways, to the person who just completed their 500th resume... I feel your pain. Unemployment is awful -- especially when you're not eligible for unemployment benefits and you can't pay your rent. *sigh* Alright I'm ending it here... feel free to visit my blog-- there's been a lot of job-search related frustrations lately. :) GoodLuck!

       A Major Milestone   I just wanted to drop by with a quick announcement of a major milestone that I have reached in my personal job search, although I'm not sure how pleased I am to have reached it... today I logged my 500th job that I've applied to in  urlLink JobFiler .  Now, granted my job search has been on and off for about a year and a half now (with time off for good behavior of course, and contracts here and there). And I have turned down a few jobs to date that were not a good fit for me, either organizationally, economically, or idealogically. Nontheless, 500 jobs is an awful lot of jobs to be applying to, even when the economy is somewhat depressed.  And speaking of depressed...

Other aspects I could do without; namely, the politics, the inconsistencies in following procedures.  The inconsistencies in following procedures is something I'm figuring out how to live with.  I liken my behavior to a detective who doesn't always "go by the book" on things and yet still accomplishes the organization's overall goal.  I don't consider this to be a long-term assignment, but it works for right now.  [cross-posted to  urlLink Journey Inside My Mind ]

      That's right, gentle readers. I want to let others know about how you have successfully found a job. It may be your current one or a previous one - it doesn't matter. I want to encourage other job seekers with your success. You will receive no reimbursement from this, except for the gratification that your story has helped to inspire countless others who are where you once were.  Be specific, but don't mention any company names. That may sound like a contradiction in terms, and you may disagree with this approach - let me know and I may reconsider. Instead, use a generic title, such as "software development consulting company", "global consumer products company", and so on. If you would like some help, then let me know.  I will only use your initials or first name and last initial when presenting your success story. I am specifically interested in answers to the following:  What position were you applying for?  How did you contact the particular company?  Describe the interviewing process.  Did you work part-time or as a contractor/consultant with the company before being hired?  How long was the process from your first contact with the company to your first day of work?  Describe your emotional state during the process. Were you anxious? Excited? Stressed? Impatient? Frustrated? Let us know.  So email me your job hunting success stories at danimal0416 AT gmail.com (replace the " AT " with the "@", of course), and we'll get these published here at "Get That Job!"

      While there are a few legitimate companies out there that do charge jobseekers a fee for their services, it is my firm belief that 90% of the job search sites that ask job seekers for money are to be approached with a very large grain of caution.  Here is an article about a recent experience I had with a bogus job site, and some tips on how to watch out for, and protect yourself from, job site scams.   urlLink click here to read entire article on Jobfiler.com

        (My Yahoo! Daily Tip)   by Caroline Levchuck   You can remake yourself on the job. But first you have to stop the real (or imagined) problem behavior.   First, identify what's holding you back. Do you regularly miss deadlines?  Are you defensive with your manager or argumentative with coworkers? Are you reluctant to take on new tasks?   Once you've admitted to yourself that you need to improve your performance, you have to admit it to your manager. Meet with your boss and share how you want to improve. Ask for feedback on what kind of behavior she'd like to see and ask for her support. Come up with a schedule to check in regularly and discuss your improvement.   If you want further help, talk to the human resource department. HR often has tools to help employees who are struggling, including job coaching and counseling.

      The number of workers getting fired for violating e-mail policies is rising as companies face more subpoenas of e-mail records, according to a new poll.  Twenty-five percent of companies terminated a worker for violating e-mail policies, up from 22 percent last year, according to the poll.  Employees who get fired often are sending messages that violate a company's e-mail policy regarding content, such as messages with inappropriate language or photos. Another common mistake: using the company e-mail system for personal messages.     urlLink General Career News

      Since I began this blog two years ago, the template (layout, design, etc.) has not changed that much.  I feel that it's time to take advantage of more flexibility that the Blogger folks have provided and update the template.  So, in the not-too-distant future, look for this blog to have a different look.  I've already set it up so that each post has a title and link field, and I've enabled Blogger comments.  In addition, I need to update/upgrade the blogroll.  I created the blogroll you currently see at a time when users of the Blogrolling.com basic service were able to have multiple blogrolls.  Since the folks over there have changed the service, they graciously still provide the blogroll, but I'm unable to make changes to it.  If none of this makes any sense to you, then that's okay.  The bottom line is that we're making some changes to this blog, which I hope are for the better!  Take care and go get that job!

       Freebies for Jobseekers   Most of the big career sites offer free resources and support for jobseekers, from articles and advice to newsletters, resume critiques and more. The key to taking advantage of these freebies is twofold: limit the information you give them and don't agree to pay for anything.  Set up a freebie email account to subscribe to newsletters and register on these sites. That way, you can discard the email address when you're done with it (or if it gets overwhelmed by spam).  Here are a couple of free offers worth a look:  urlLink Get a free resume critique from A and A Resume    urlLink Let CareerBuilder email you with jobs targeted to your specifications   Get access to millions of professionals who want to give and get advice while building a mutually beneficial network on  urlLink Monster.com    urlLink Subscribe to HotJobs  free  newsletter for job seekers  with articles and tips on conducting your job search from networking and initial inquiries to interviewing and negotiating your salary requirements.

        urlLink Career Coaching    The right career or life coach can be a valuable asset to you in your overall career path. Often, people who seek career counseling are not only planning for their next job but the one after that (and the one after that) – looking at their careers in big picture terms and focusing their professional growth and development activities along that path.  Career coaches can help people to create and carry out plans related to their life and career goals. They can assist with resume preparation and job searches, guide people toward suitable industries or fields, or help resolve specific career challenges that are holding them back.  With the number of career coaches out there, it can be daunting to try to find the right one to work with. To help in this process, we've added a  urlLink coaches database  to Jobfiler.com.  If you are a coach, or have a coach you're working with now, please encourage them to stop by and create their free listing in this directory.

       Job Search Tip: Set up automated job search agents   Looking at the lead sources you have targeted for your job search, these sources most likely include job banks, classifieds, recruiters, discussion lists, newsgroups, etc.  Select a number of key sites that you feel would be of assistance, and set up automated job search agents to search for you daily/weekly and email you the results.  This ensures that you are not missing any key job postings, and also gives you an action item first thing every morning (review the jobs that have been emailed to you and respond to the ones that are interesting). Setting up job search agents is a free and easy way to give yourself an edge in your job search. Some of the sites that I recommend looking at and setting up automated agents for include:    urlLink Monster.com      urlLink Career Builder      urlLink  HotJobs.com     Once you have your agents set up, it's merely a matter of staying on top of reviewing and responding to the postings as they come in.  If you are tracking your job search using  urlLink JobFiler or another job search organizer , you can also get a sense for which sites are bringing you the best leads over time, as well as which job sites are posting the same old tired jobs, week after week.    For more job search tips and advice, check out  urlLink Jobfiler's job search support forums , where you can post your job search related question in our Q&A section and have your question answered by a professional career coach.    Happy Hunting!

      Help Make Blogs More Visible!  NOTE: Be sure you paste live links for the Path List below.  There are by some estimates more than a million weblogs. But most of them get no visibility in search engines. Only a few "A-List" blogs get into the top search engine results for a given topic, while the majority of blogs just don't get noticed. The reason is that the smaller blogs don't have enough links pointing to them. But this posting could solve that. Let's help the smaller blogs get more visibility!  This posting is  urlLink GoMeme 4.0 . It is part of an experiment to see if we can create a blog posting that helps 1000's of blogs get higher rankings in Google. So far we have tried 3 earlier variations. Our first test,  urlLink GoMeme 1.0 , spread to nearly 740 blogs in 2.5 days. This new version 4.0 is shorter, simpler, and fits more easily into your blog.  Why are we doing this? We want to help thousands of blogs get more visibility in Google and other search engines. How does it work? Just follow the instructions below to re-post this meme in your blog and add your URL to the end of the Path List below. As the meme spreads onwards from your blog, so will your URL. Later, when your blog is indexed by search engines, they will see the links pointing to your blog from all the downstream blogs that got this via you, which will cause them to rank your blog higher in search results. Everyone in the Path List below benefits in a similar way as this meme spreads. Try it! Instructions: Just copy this entire post and paste it into your blog. Then add your URL to the end of the path list below, and pass it on!  Path List  1.  urlLink Minding the Planet  2.  urlLink Wireless LAN  3.  urlLink Writing Resources  4.  urlLink BillBoard  5.  urlLink Stock Quotes Stock Trading Stock Help  6.  urlLink Christmas All Year  7.  urlLink Quotes from Famous People  8.  urlLink Recipes at World Famous Recipes  9.  urlLink Jobs and Employment  10.  urlLink Quotes  11.  urlLink Jokes and Humor  12.  urlLink 480 Area Code Guide  13.  urlLink Phoenix Arizona East Valley Community Index  14.  urlLink HTTP in Phoenix AZ  15.  urlLink Daily Bible Verse  16.  urlLink Love Poems  18.  urlLink World Famous Recipes  19.  urlLink Recipes Recipe  20.  urlLink Members Space  21.  urlLink Journey Inside My Mind  22.  urlLink QuotesBlog  23.  urlLink Get That Job!  24.

        To: National Desk   Contact: Dirk Fillpot of the U.S. Department of Labor, 202-693-4676  HAMMOND, La., Aug. 3 /U.S. Newswire/ -- U.S. Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao told the Louisiana Economic Forum that President Bush's leadership and sound economic policies have led to strong job growth in Louisiana and across America, and that the Administration's commitment to reforming training and employment programs will help workers find and prepare for new job opportunities in the growing economy.  "Nationally, this is the 10th straight month of job growth," Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao said in the Forum's keynote address at Southeastern Louisiana University. "More than 1.5 million new jobs have been created since last August. The national unemployment rate is now 5.6 percent, which is lower than the average unemployment rate of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s."  The steady and consistent growth in the national economy is evident in Louisiana, Secretary Chao noted. Louisiana's unemployment rate has dropped a full percentage point since June of last year. Louisiana added 5,900 jobs in June, across a broad range of sectors. Secretary Chao also pointed out that while the economy continues to improve, the Administration is committed to helping workers who are still looking for good, high-paying jobs.  "These improvements are good news for Louisiana and for the country. But President Bush and this Administration recognize that there are folks in Louisiana who still need help. The Department of Labor has tremendous resources available to help workers who are looking for jobs, transitioning between jobs or upgrading their skills," Chao said.  Some of the services available to job seekers include job training and counseling. Workers can also receive help paying for transportation, child-care expenses and health insurance premiums while looking for work. Louisiana alone receives $132.8 million annually from the U.S. Department of Labor for training and employment services.  Chao also encouraged workers in need of assistance to visit one of 19 Comprehensive One-Stop Career Centers in Louisiana. Workers can find the nearest center at  urlLink http://www.servicelocator.org .   via  urlLink U.S. Newswire

        "Tonight, when you lay your head on your pillow, forget how far you still have to go.  Look instead at how far you've already come."  -- Bob Moawad:  It is so easy for me to get discouraged sometimes when I think about all that I didn't get done today.  What I really need to remind myself of is how much I   have   done.   "May the road rise up to meet you.  May the wind be at your back.  May your mission in life feed your passion like no other." -- Unknown:  Amen!   "Often intuition will direct you.  If it feels right, it's probably right." -- Oprah Winfrey:   This one I don't completely agree with because it might feel right, for example, for me to rob a bank.  In that case following my intuition is a bad idea.  I believe it is better to sound your ideas off others, who can provide objective opinions.

"Let the world know you as you are, not as you think you should be----because sooner or later, if you are posing, you will forget the pose and then where are you?"                                                     -- Fanny Brice     Aha!  Be as you are and you will never have to try to be anyone else.   If you're never scared or embarrassed or hurt, it means you never take any chances."  -- Julie Sorel:  Get out of the boat, just like Peter did when he saw Jesus walking on the water.

        Comprehending Engineers - Take Nine   An engineer was crossing a road one day when a frog called out to him and said, "If you kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful princess."   He bent over, picked up the frog and put it in his pocket.   The frog spoke up again and said, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful princess, I will stay with you for one week."   The engineer took the frog out of his pocket, smiled at it and returned it to the pocket.   The frog then cried out, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a princess, I'll stay with you and do ANYTHING you want."   Again the engineer took the frog out, smiled  at it and put it back into his pocket.   Finally, the frog asked, "What is the matter? I've told you I'm a beautiful princess, that I'll stay with you for a week and do anything you want. Why won't you kiss me?"   The engineer said, "Look I'm an engineer. I don't have time for a girlfriend, but a talking frog......that's cool."

The artist said he enjoyed time with his mistress, because the passion and mystery he found there. The engineer said, "I like both."    "Both?"  Engineer: "Yeah. If you have a wife and a mistress, they will each assume you are spending time with the other woman, and you can go to the lab and get some work done."

Let's have a word with him."  "Hi George. say, what's with that group ahead of us? They're rather slow, aren't they?"   The greens keeper replied, "Oh, yes, that's a group of blind firefighters. They lost their sight saving our clubhouse from a fire last year, so we always let them play for free anytime."  The group was silent for a moment. The pastor said, "That's so sad. I think I will say a special prayer for them tonight."  The doctor said, "Good idea. And I'm going to contact my ophthalmologist buddy and see if there's anything he can do for them."  The engineer said, "Why can't these guys play at night?"

        Note:  I have a Civil Engineering degree from the University of Cincinnati, so I find these very funny.  Or maybe it's because I'm a computer programmer now...    Comprehending Engineers - Take One   Two engineering students were walking across campus when one said, "Where did you get such a great bike?"  The second engineer replied, "Well,  I was walking along yesterday minding my own business when a beautiful woman rode up on this bike. She threw the bike to the ground, took off all her clothes and said, "Take what you want."  The second engineer nodded approvingly, "Good choice; the clothes probably wouldn't have fit."

         Motivation    "A ship in a harbor is safe, but that is not what ships are for." - William Shedd:   DO something with your life!  Make yourself useful.  God has given each of us talents to be used to build.  How tragic to just sit there and do nothing.   "Do not fear mistakes, there are none." - Miles Davis:   The legendary jazz trumpeter had something.  He was not afraid to reinvent himself.  With this idea in perspective, how can we go wrong?  Everything, even a "mistake", can be something valuable.   "The purpose of man is in action, not thought." - Thomas Carlyle:   We were born into this world for a reason.  It is good to think, but eventually we need to act.  Our lives are meant to be lived in motion, not in stagnancy.

         urlLink Proverbs 24:11, NIV      "Rescue those being led away to death; hold back those staggering toward slaughter."   Sometime I'll have to share about how someone reached out to me, which eventually resulted in my being rescued from being led away to my "spiritual" death.  Until then, it's important to realize that we're not alone - the world does not revolve around me.  We must consider others' needs, among them being their spiritual condition.

         BALANCE    "Balance isn't either/or; it's and." - Stephen R. Covey :  I cannot be so focused on one particular aspect of my life and say that I'm a balanced individual.  I need to fulfill all my responsiblities not only to God, but also to my family, job, etc.  I have, however, prioritized these aspects so that, during crunch time, I know what is most important.   "Keep in mind always the present you are constructing.  It should be the future that you want" - Alice Walker :  In other words, I must consistently evaluate whether what I'm doing is going to get me where I want to go.   "Decisiveness is the art of timely cruelty." - Henry Becque :It sometimes hurts to make decisions because someone is not going to get what they want when you don't decide their way.

        Hallelujah! : urlLink Permalinks to Blog*Spot posts work!   For those of you who may not understand, every time I refer to a specific post from a weblog hosted by Blog*Spot (one of mine or someone else's), the link would get messed up by being directed to a link with a '?' in it.  The result was often that you would get the main archive page that had the post on it, but you would also need to search for the post within that page.  Now, apparently, the links work the way they were intended to, by getting you directly to the post you were looking for.  Cheers!

James Traficant, D-Ohio      "My people elected me and I don't think you should take their representative away. ... Vote your conscience. Nothing personal."  -- Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio   "I'm prepared to lose everything. I'm prepared to go to jail. You go ahead and expel me."  -- Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio   "None of us ever wants to sit in judgment of our peer. There are some unique occasions, however, when the behavior of an elected official violates the public trust to such an extent that we are called upon to uphold this provision of the Constitution that we swore to support and defend."  -- Rep. Joel Hefley, R-Colo., chairman of the House ethics committee that recommended Traficant's expulsion   "This is a day that each of us hoped would never come and we pray that it will not come again. Simply put, there is absolutely no satisfaction in judging one of our own. But the Constitution makes clear that we are the only ones that can judge a fellow member of Congress in cases such as Mr. Traficant's."  -- Rep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash   "[The ethics committee,] involving an equal number of Democrats and Republicans, covering an incredible range of philosophies and ideologies ... have applied our rules to the facts as we see them and unanimously recommended expulsion. No one did it easily, for some it was an incredibly difficult conclusion to reach."  -- Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif.   "When you destroy that fragile bond of trust between the elected and the electorate expulsion is the only appropriate remedy, regrettably."  -- Rep. Kenny Hulshof, R-Mo.

         "Contemplate the mangled bodies of your countrymen, and then say, 'What should be the reward of such sacrifices?' Bid us and our posterity bow the knee, supplicate the friendship, and plough, and sow, and reap, to glut the avarice of the men who have let loose on us the dogs of war to riot in our blood and hunt us from the face of the earth? If ye love wealth better than liberty, the tranquility of servitude than the animating contest of freedom, go from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or arms. Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains sit lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen!"   -- Samuel Adams

         I've had this list in my email for quite awhile, and it's time I included it here. - DAJ     TWENTY TRUTHS TO LIVE BY   Faith is the ability to not panic. If you worry, you didn't pray. If you pray, don't worry. As a child of God, prayer is kind of like calling home every day. Blessed are the flexible, for they shall not be bent out of shape. When we get tangled up in our problems, be still. God wants us to be still so God can untangle the knot. Do the math. Count your blessings. God wants spiritual fruit, not religious nuts. Dear God: I have a problem. It's me. Silence is often misinterpreted, but never misquoted. Laugh every day. It's like inner jogging. The most important things in your home are the people. Growing old is inevitable. Growing up is optional. There is no key to happiness. The door is always open. A grudge is a heavy thing to carry. He who dies with the most toys is still dead. We do not remember days, but moments. Life moves too fast, so enjoy your precious moments. Nothing is real to you until you experience it; otherwise it's just hearsay. It's all right to sit on your pity pot every now and again. Just flush when you are done. Living your life successfully and surviving requires courage. The goals and dreams you're seeking require courage and risk taking. Learn from the turtle -- it only makes progress when it sticks out its neck. Be more concerned with your character than your reputation, because your character is what you really are, while your reputation is merely what others think you are.

With courage you welcome each new experience as an opportunity to exercise your positive energy in a productive, purposeful direction. You are not afraid of what you do not know; you become eager to learn it. You do not hesitate to extend your efforts into unfamiliar areas because unfamiliar does not mean unfriendly.

        Help Make Blogs More Visible!   NOTE: Be sure you paste live links for the Path List below.  There are by some estimates more than a million weblogs. But most of them get no visibility in search engines. Only a few "A-List" blogs get into the top search engine results for a given topic, while the majority of blogs just don't get noticed. The reason is that the smaller blogs don't have enough links pointing to them. But this posting could solve that. Let's help the smaller blogs get more visibility!  This posting is  urlLink GoMeme 4.0 . It is part of an experiment to see if we can create a blog posting that helps 1000's of blogs get higher rankings in Google. So far we have tried 3 earlier variations. Our first test,  urlLink GoMeme 1.0 , spread to nearly 740 blogs in 2.5 days. This new version 4.0 is shorter, simpler, and fits more easily into your blog.  Why are we doing this? We want to help thousands of blogs get more visibility in Google and other search engines. How does it work? Just follow the instructions below to re-post this meme in your blog and add your URL to the end of the Path List below. As the meme spreads onwards from your blog, so will your URL. Later, when your blog is indexed by search engines, they will see the links pointing to your blog from all the downstream blogs that got this via you, which will cause them to rank your blog higher in search results. Everyone in the Path List below benefits in a similar way as this meme spreads. Try it! Instructions: Just copy this entire post and paste it into your blog. Then add your URL to the end of the path list below, and pass it on!

       OK, So It's Not Bipolar..   I went to my new psychiatrist today for the first time.  He had read my history and talked about a lot of stuff.  He tends to believe that I have Depression and some ADD/ADHD symptoms.  I'm going to take this test related to the ADD/ADHD stuff and see how I score.  Doc seems to think I'll score high for ADD/ADHD.  Also, I'm having to change my meds, which I don't mind that much.  One of the side effects of the Depakote is weight gain.  Since I've been on it, I've gained about 30 lbs.  So I'm looking forward to not having that.  I'm increasing my dose of Wellbutrin, and gradually moving off the Effexor-XR and on Celexa.  I felt really great after the appointment because it was as though I'm getting a better understanding of who I am.  I can get messed up about having these disorders, and when other things go awry in my life, I'm not always able to tell whether it's the disorder or some other weakness in my character.  Well, heck.  I've gotta get home to my lovely wife and beautiful daughter.

       Learning Grammar   Keisha came home from preschool today and showed Jennie a piece of paper.  Her class practiced tracing their names.  When Jennie asked her whose name was on the paper, she replied, "Keisha's."  Jennie then tried to correct her by getting her to be grammatically correct and say "No, it's  my  name."  Keisha responded, "No, Mommy.  It's   Keisha's  !"

       Dreams  Been having some interesting dreams lately.  Unfortunately, I can't remember all the details.  In one dream I needed to be at a certain bus stop or something like that, so that I could take an important trip somewhere.  It's really hard to put all the details down, because they are racing through my head.

      I've been researching a little on self-injury, because I pick at scabs to make them bleed.  The main site I've found is for the  urlLink American Self-Harm Information Clearinghouse .  I currently have a big scab on my face to the lower right of my mouth.  It's really itchy, and it hurts.  Since this morning, I've been able to keep from picking at it.  Sometimes, like when I'm in the shower, I've used the razor to cut it.  Typically, it starts out as something small and eventually becomes big.  I've used hydrogen peroxide to help clean it, and some anti-bacterial ointment to help keep it moist.  When the scab on my face gets dry, it becomes really itchy and painful, like it is now.

       Justifiable Use of Force   Today is Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday.  As many know, he was a civil rights activist that worked for peace through nonviolent means.  Are there any times when violence is right?  What a difficult question to answer.  Ever since the terrorist attacks on the US last year, I have believed that it is necessary to use force.  We gave the Taliban time to turn over Osama bin Laden, and they let it run out.  As a result, we dropped bombs on them.  On a much smaller scale, I think about times when my wife and I must discipline our daughter.  We have set up boundaries and expectations for her.  When she goes outside of those boundaries, we have a moral obligation to discipline her, so that she can learn to respect authority.  Sometimes, then, we need to spank her.  Other times we remove priveleges.  I believe that the United States and its allies have taken a similar approach in the war on terrorism.  Basically, President Bush has stated that terrorists will be disciplined for their acts of terror.  Financial assets have been frozen.  Also, we've used military force.  Thus, I see our current situation as one in which the use of force is justified.  The principle is the same in law enforcement.  A police officer tells a gun-wielding suspect to drop his or her weapon.  If he or she does not, then in some cases, the officer may have to use deadly force.   What do you think?  Feel free to  urlLink drop me a line.

I've written poetry and some other things, but not a short story.    I don't even know why I'm saying this.  It's as though I'm already believing that I can't do it!  How faithless!

      Hi.  I'm feeling incredibly depressed right now, to the point of tears.  I don't know exactly where it's coming from.  Perhaps that we're into the new year and I don't have a clear vision for what I want to accomplish.  Part of me doesn't want to go through with it at all - just stay where I am (as though that would really make me feel better).  I don't know.  I am prone to depression, and I take medicine to help alleviate it.  I took my meds about 15 minutes ago, so I'm waiting for them to kick in.  You know, when a depressive episode kicks in, I really hate that I have it.  It feels frustrating, as though I'm out of control of what's going on.  I just look forward to it passing.

       Can You Say 'OOPS'?  Check this out, excerpted from a spot in the NY Post yesterday:   January 8, 2002 -- CNN yanks 'sexy' Paula spot    IN a wacky attempt to stave off the ratings onslaught of rival Fox News Channel, CNN went bonkers over the weekend by shamelessly promoting mother-of-three anchor Paula Zahn as "sexy."   Media-watchers were startled when a racy commercial for Zahn's show, "American Morning with Paula Zahn," ran on CNN over the weekend.   "Where can you find a morning news anchor who's provocative, super-smart, oh, yeah, and just a little sexy?" a male announcer asked during the 20-second spot. The word "sexy" flashed in red letters and an image of the well-coiffed blond anchor popped up on screen.   The ad was pulled yesterday morning. Walter Isaacson, chairman and CEO of CNN's Newsgroup, groaned in a statement: "It was a major blunder by our promotions department. The ad was never seen or approved by anyone outside of the promo department.   ------

       Wendy's Loses Its Father   Today I found out that Dave Thomas, the founder and spokesman for Wendy's International, had passed away from liver cancer.  What a great guy he was!  The commercials I saw on TV weren't at all pretentious, which, from what I read, describes the man who founded the company.  I can still remember the "Where's the Beef?" set of commercials in 1980.  What a riot!  He died extremely wealthy, according to a  urlLink Forbes report .  I also loved that he supported adoption so much.  He will be missed in the flesh, but I believe we'll still see him, perhaps in cartoon form, like "The Colonel" from KFC.

       Ideas for the Family Website   I've been gathering ideas to include on our family's website.  I plan to include some information about our daughter, Keisha, who is hard of hearing.  This search has led me to some interesting sites, such as the following:    urlLink Phonak MicroLink MLx FM System , which we recently obtained;    urlLink Audiology Department, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio , where we obtained her hearing aids and FM system;    urlLink Children's Medical Center, Dayton, Ohio , where Keisha's current audiologist/speech therapist is located;    urlLink Community Services for the Deaf  in Dayton, Ohio    urlLink OtiKids  Web Site, from Oticon, who made Keisha's hearing aids   OK.  So that's it for now. Later.   Update:  Some other things to include on our family's website include   family pictures   "About" pages for Dan, Jennie, and Keisha   family mission statement   enhanced guestbook with additional fields, etc. (such as, how in the World Wide Web did you find this site?)   Either I'll use this forum to desribe what is new and as a journal, or I'll use something else.  Update:  To help visitors know what is new to the Family home page, I've provided the means to sign up for a mailing list on the home page itself, via  urlLink NotifyList.com .  I plan to send this list on a monthly basis.   urlLink So sign up now !

Question:  Is it possible to identify how many websites are actually available on the Web?

       People Are Strange, Part 3   Police in Radnor, Pennsylvania, interrogated a suspect by placing a metal colander on his head and connecting it with wires to a photocopy machine.  The message "He's lying" was placed in the copier, and police pressed the copy button each time they thought the suspect wasn't telling the truth.  Believing the "lie detector" was working, the suspect confessed.

       People Are Strange, Part 2   Recently a distraught young lady was spotted weeping beside her car.    "Do you need  some help?" I asked.   She replied, "I knew I should have replaced the battery to this remote door unlocker. Now I can't get into my car.  Do you think they (pointing to a distant convenient store) would have a battery to fit this?"   "Hmmm, I dunno.  Do you have an alarm too?" I asked.   "No, just this remote thingy," she answered, handing it and the car keys to me.  As I took the key and manually unlocked the door,  I replied, "Why don't you drive over there and check about the batteries. It's a long walk."

       People Are Strange, Part 1   This next series of posts, entitled "People Are Strange", are excerpts from an email I received from my friend JI:   A lady at work was seen putting a credit card into her floppy drive and pulling it out very quickly. When inquired as to what she was doing, she said she was shopping on the Internet and they kept asking for a credit card number, so she was using the ATM "thingy".

       A Run For My Life   I had a very strange dream last night.  Some other people (friends?) and I were being chased through a multi-story building with a parking lot by a psychopath.  It also took place at a park nearby.  The dream seemed like it lasted about an hour, as though it could have been an episode of a TV drama.  As these things often are, unfortunately the details are now fuzzy.  Below are some things that I can remember, though:  - The chase mostly occurred on the elevators - We knew that a friend of ours, TM, was on his way into work.  He had parked on the 9-1/2th floor.  We tried for as long as possible to keep the elevator from stopping there because we knew that TM was unaware of the danger before him. - To make the elevator stop at the 9-1/2 floor, you had to press the buttons for the 9th and 10th floors and stop the elevator in between.  I remember something like this being done in the movie " urlLink Being John Malchovich ". - Just as soon as we thought things were getting back to normal, this guy - the psychopath - would flip out again and resume chasing us. - Indeed we felt like we were almost always on the run for our lives. - Eventually we thought it was safe enough to get TM from the 9-1/2th floor, but as soon as we stopped there, we realized that the psycho has become aware of the existence of the 9-1/2 floor.  We had somehow thought that it was a "safe haven" - until then. - Unfortunately we couldn't help our friend TM.  By the time we arrived at the 9-1/2th floor, the psychopath had already got to him.

       The Hunt, Part 2    He didn't have much time.  If he was going to do it, then this was the time.  No turning back...   The thrill of the hunt is what drove him.  He'd often go without sleep when he was in pursuit.  Nothing but reaching his goal would satisfy him.  He'd deal with each obstacle as it came, overcoming and advancing.  No weather, no circumstance, nobody was going to stop him from getting...  ... that cheeseburger.

       The Hunt, Part 1   He felt the hunger pangs in his mortal coil again.  This time they were stronger and didn't seem to want to subside.  He knew he had to do something quickly, or he would be overcome.  So he made a mad dash for the vending machine.  He reached into his pocket only to discover that he had no change to obtain that which his body needed, the sustance for his soul.  He looked around and saw the fire extinguisher hanging on the wall.  No one else was around anyway, and he was usually the last one to leave his workplace.  He further glanced around and saw that there were no cameras watching his every move.  So he yanked the fire extinguisher off the wall and smashed it into the vending machine.  The glass shattered and he now had access to as much candy, chips, gum, and cookies as he wanted.  He gathered as much as he could in his arms and headed back to his cubicle.  He sat down and began opening each item and eating it.  About fifteen minutes later, he fell asleep, satisfied that his hunt had been successful.

       Continuance...   He cried harder than he ever thought he could cry.  His heart ached so hard.  He thought he was going crazy, the whirlwind of images blowing his mind.  He fell to the floor, clutching his hands in desperation, begging for relief.  The pain was almost more than he could handle.  He looked up and the world appeared crooked, tilted somehow.  Then the door slammed open with a crash.  Four men wearing white came in with a stretcher.  The sound of them walking was like an Army marching to a cadence.  "How could they be so cruel?" he thought, pounding his head to the floor.  The men gathered our hero and carried him out of his room and placed him in the ambulance.  Some time later, he woke up in the hospital ward, somehow well-rested.  The sun was shining warmly on his face.  Even the headache was beginning to wear off.  He was relieved that the overdose of pills had finally worn off.  This would be the last time.

       Different Interpretations (subtitled - Karaoke)   Last Saturday, February 15, 2002, Jennie and I went to a marriage retreat sponsored by our  urlLink church .  The entertainment portion consisted of karaoke by those attending.  The hardest part, for me at least, at one of these things, is to come up with my   first   song to do.  I chose " urlLink Bohemian Rhapsody " by Queen, but I didn't want to do it all by myself.  A song like that requires at least four people.  I wound up getting five people to come up on stage with me.  It was a riot!  I couldn't see anyone in the audience because of the stage lights, but I didn't care.  When it came to the fast instrumental section ("So you think you can stone me..."), we did the " urlLink Wayne's World " head-banging thang.  Then, about six songs later, I was back onstage, doing " urlLink Mambo No. 5 ", by Lou Bega.  Let's just say these were both... um...  different interpretations .

       Finding The Lord:Your Monday Morning Devotional delivered right to yer e-mail box    The following came from GB - what a funny guy!    A drunk stumbles along a Baptismal service on a Sunday afternoon down by the river.  He proceeds to stumble down into the water and stands next to the Minister.  The Minister turns, notices the old drunk and says, "Mister, are you ready to find Jesus?"  The drunk looks back and says, "Yes sir, I am."  The Minister then dunks the fellow under the water and pulls him right back up.  "Have you found Jesus?" the Minister asked.  "No, I didn't!" said the drunk.  The Minister then dunks him under for quite a bit longer, brings him up and says, "Now brother, have you found Jesus?"  "No, I did not!" said the man again.  Disgusted, the Minister holds the man under for at least 30 seconds this time, brings him up and demands, "For the grace of God, have you found Jesus yet?!!!??"  The old drunk wipes his eyes and pleads, "Are you sure this is where he fell in???"

       More Small Talk @ Work Question of the Day    In response to GB's earlier message, LC wrote:    Wow. I feel depressed just reading that.  I was planning on working outside on my car's radiator hoses, getting dirty, freezing my arms and fingers off, skinning my knuckles on the engine whenever my hands slip off the wrench or I snap the head off another bolt (I've snapped 3 bolts off already.) Then I will get changed and go to work for six hours. Then I will come home and work on two homework assignments that I have already spent four hours on that are due tomorrow and I doubt that I can complete.  But after all that, such a long and difficult day, I will come home and give my girlfriend a call and talk to my sweet, because it's Valentines Day. What a special day this is for both of us. Oh, wait, I don't have a girlfriend. Before I crash for the night, I will probably eat some oatmeal and some shredded wheat straight from the box 'cause I don't have any milk, and wash it down with some water. I will be so tired that I will go to sleep without brushing my teeth.  Then I will fall asleep because it's two in the morning.  That is my plan for Valentines day.  - LC

       Like Peeing on the Floor    This may sound like a strange title, but you'll get what I mean as you read on.   We came home tonight from a meeting with MM and KM, two close friends of ours, to talk about our marriage.  I thought things were going Ok, but Jennie didn't think so.  So we discussed how she was feeling and why she was feeling that way.  It turns out that I haven't been as considerate of her as I should be.  In the Bible, Philippians 2:3-4 urlLink   mentions that we should think of one another as better than ourselves.  I haven't been doing that, and I've realized that I'm hurting Jennie when I'm being this way.  She doesn't feel loved, for example, when I spend more time at work than need be, or more time on the computer, instead of with her.  It's not that she wants to hog all my time; she just needs to feel loved.  She needs me, with my full attention.  We also discussed how Jennie ought to change, from my perspective.  This question was very hard for me to answer at first.  I started getting very emotional, to the point where I was crying.  I don't know exactly where it came from - all of a sudden I was sobbing in their living room.  I felt incredibly embarassed, as though I had lost control of my bladder and was peeing on their floor.  I felt guilty for once again hearing how much I've hurt my wife by my actions.  I really hate myself when I do that.  Feeling so bad about it, I guess, led to the guilt, which led to the depressive episode, which included the crying.  It was another of those times when I struggled to find good in the situation.  Boy, when this depression hits, it hits hard.  One thing I am definitely grateful for in our marriage is that our love is there, yet there are still times when I need to be affirmed.  You know what I mean?  I know women feel the same way - we need to hear that we're loved and appreciated.  I guess that I haven't been feeling that from Jennie lately.  And she hasn't felt loved because I've let other things occupy my time instead of her.  So we both have things to work on - which is why we wake up in the morning - because God isn't finished with us yet.  Oh yeah, the great thing about true friends is that they love you even when you behave like a child who's peeing on the floor.  So long and good night, everyone.

       Watching Paint Dry   Not everything I've done in my life compares to watching paint dry, but I participated in something today that ranks right up there with it.  This morning I was part of a group that upgraded our work PCs to a customized version of Windows XP.  The installation process took about an hour and a half.  That the company I'm working for had set this up as an automated process probably kept it from taking longer.  But backing up everything, installing other applications I work with, and bringing the backed-up data after the installation made entire process take about 4 hours.  So, you wanna know how I passed the time?  That's right.  You've guessed.  I played pinball on my laptop that I obtained from the consulting company I work for.  I'm actually getting pretty good at it.  My highest score so far is over 5 million points. Update:  In case you haven't realized, this is sign of  urlLink geekiness   I know... this doesn't have much to do with the price of tea in China, but hey! - it's a lot better than watching paint dry.

       Navy Summary of Mishaps - First Edition     Note:  I got this from ME, who is stationed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, in Dayton, Ohio.    A.  Jackie Gleason used to say that he drank because drinking took warts and moles off other people’s faces.  What he failed to mention is the fact that booze, as a universal solvent, immediately liquefies all the cells and synapses in those areas of the brain having to do with judgment, coordination, and common sense; turns them to mush.  Afterward, it’s like trying to cogitate with a cranium full of Cream of Wheat.  Here are three quickies to illustrate my point:  --  A n airman with a BAC (blood alcohol content) of 0.22 decided it would be the coolest thing ever if he jumped onto the back bumper of a departing Honda delete Sol to see how long he could hang on to the trunk lid as it sped away.  Got to give the kid credit for tenacity.  He stayed with it till 50 miles an hour, when his fingernails failed structurally, at which time, parasitic drag dumped him onto the highway.    --  A  pickup truckload of our Coast Guard brethren left a bar and headed down the road with four drunks in the cab and two more drunks passed out in the bed.  (Yes, as it turns out, our friends in the funny hats are human, too.)       After they dropped their first shipmate off at home, they regained the interstate and were headed for the second guy’s house at about 55 miles an hour when, like a scene from “Night of the Living Dead,” one of the corpses in the back stood up, wobbled slightly, stepped stiffly over the tailgate and disappeared into the glare of headlights from oncoming traffic.        Suddenly everybody’s sober.  They screech to a halt.  Doors fly open.  Everyone bails out and races back along the interstate in a frantic search for their buddy.  But they can’t find him.        Wait!  There he is!  Face down in the middle of the interstate – backlit by the headlights of a car that has him bore-sighted!        Time compression kicks in as they all wave their arms in slow motion and scream (in an extremely low register), "NOOOOOOO!" Trying, to no avail, to ward off the inevitable.  Thump-Thump.  And the car sped off into the night – didn’t even slow down.        But you know what?  The guy lived!  I mean he was messed up big time, but he lived, which means, in the face of this new evidence, that I must retract my previous statement.  Them Coasties ain’t human after all.     --  A s soon as a drunken Marine ditched his liberty buddies and headed back to the base, he spied a restaurant and thought he’s stop in for a bite to eat.  The fact that the restaurant was closed didn’t slow the sergeant down a whit.  This Marine wanted chow and no bars, no locked doors, and no alarm systems were going to stand in his way.        Perhaps it was the cold food or maybe it was the slow service, but something must have really irritated this guy because after he’d been in there a while he began to tear the place up.        It wasn’t long before the gendarmes, summoned by burglar alarm, arrived and tried some of their high-powered psychology to coax the Marine outside.  But, he (totally impervious to logic) wasn’t having any of that and told the copy to take their best shot.        Well, in this case, the cops’ best shot happened to be a ninety-pound German Shepherd, and they told the hungry Marine that if he didn’t come out, they were sending Bruno in.        "Bring him on!"  says the Marine.  And so Chief Wiggims let slip the dog of war.        BA DA BING!  The dog is on the Marine like white on rice and showing absolutely no respect for the sergeant.  Actually, Bruno’s finding the sergeant to be a rather zesty morsel (kinda like a slider at Mid-rats), and the fact that the Marine decided to fight back only served to whet the dog’s already prodigious appetite all the more.         In the end, of course, the score was Drunken-Devil Dog - zero, Regular Dog - five.  (Five being the total number of useless fingers dangling at the end of the sergeant’s right arm that – ever since that night – have refused to respond to his commands.)         B .  I always get burn severity messed up.  Can’t remember if it’s third degree or first degree that leaves you looking like a burger that fell off the grille and lay unnoticed on the coals for a spell.        I will say this, however.  I got this second degree burn stuff down pat, especially after I dumped boiling water and equally boiling coffee grounds on my hand one morning recently while trying to brew a cup of java while I was still asleep.        But that was small change compared to what a drunken seaman did not long ago.  It seems that six beers and a couple shots of bourbon convinced this guy he was an acrobat.  After ditching his buddies at the bar, our here made it back to the pier Ok.  But there, the lure of fame and the challenge of the high wire were more than he could resist.  So, instead of plodding drunkenly along on something stable and flat link the concrete roadway, this would=be Flying Wallenda jumped up on the CHT piping that ran parallel with the pier and began tippy-toeing along it’s length toward his ship.  And he was lookin’ gooooood, beloved.  Until, that it, he encountered a knot of pumps and valves that squirts a solution of highly caustic hypochlorite into the raw sewage.  There, he stumbled and fell.        But, true to his calling, he wasn’t going down without a fight.  He frantically grabbed for a handhold – anything to break his fall, and he snagged one!  Unfortunately, what he snagged was one of those high pressure chemical lines which immediately popped out of its fitting and sprayed our hapless hero from head to toe with a caustic bath of searing hypo-chloride.        At the hospital they catalogued his misery as: second degree chemical burns of the groin, the abdomen, left thigh, right ear, left face and left arm.  And, for good measure, a third degree burn on his inner right thigh that nearly fried his oysters and will require several skin grafts.        But I did get a chuckle out of the unbridled optimism of this report, which said that, after five days in the hospital and 35 days out of work, “No permanent disability is anticipated."  Yeah, right.        I burned my hand two months ago and it’s still as pink as sunrise except when it turns purplish red in the shower and throbs like mad if I get it in warm water.  Don’t let anybody fool you; this guy’s going to be in pain for a long, long time.         C .  I read in the paper this week that Daimler-Chrysler has embarked on a program designed to provide job security for the entire traffic safety section of the naval safety center for a good many years to come.  With the rollout of their new Dodge, V-10, pick-up truck, we enter a new era of potential disaster.  When one considers that sailors in the past have actually managed to break telephone poles in half using just a motorcycle, the possibilities for carnage, mayhem, death and destruction posed by this new, 150-mile-an-hour, 4000 pound, unguided rocket in the hands of your average North American blue jacket are enough to boggle the mind.        Heaven knows they’re doing a more than adequate job with the tools at hand today:         A  carload of sailors were on their way to a little weekend liberty, when the kid in the right seat spilled a drink in his lap and then turned and started ragging the driver about his erratic motoring skills.  The driver barked back.  So, in response, the passenger dumped what was left in his cup on the driver’s leg… you know, just to give him a feel for what it’s like to be facing a night on the town looking like you’ve recently lost control of your bladder.  This brought a heated retort from the driver, who totally failed to see the humor.  At which time the passenger doubled up his fist and smashed it into the windshield (“Take that!”), and the driver responded by slamming on the brakes and skidding headfirst into a mini-van in the opposing lane of traffic.         A t a party Saturday night I met a woman who teaches anger management to elementary school children.  I found that highly amusing until she explained to me there is real value in early training for the still undeveloped infantile mind in the techniques for handling stress and managing anger.  Maybe I’ll give her these guys’ address to see if she can hook them up with some kind of correspondence course.  It couldn’t hurt.  --- end of post ----

      I am feeling very emotional.  I just spent time praying to God about how I'm feeling.  Crying, angry, bitter, frustrated.  Hot tears falling from my eyes.  Hurting from within my heart, wanting it all to go away.  Even more troublesome was that I was doing this in front of my little girl.  She had been "scared", and both Jennie and I were tired, wanting to go to bed.  She kept crying out for one of us.  When she cried out to me, I was so upset.  I went in with my voice raised telling her she needed to go to sleep.  I asked if she wanted to pray, and she said yes.  Well, I started praying for her, and then I started crying out my frustration with how I've been feeling.  I often have a hard time with this depression and ADHD stuff I'm dealing with.  I have trouble seeing what I can control and what I cannot.  I'm upset that I'm hurting those whom I love the most - Jennie and Keisha.  I've not been responsible.  I feel like I've let so many people down, especially Jennie.    Because of this I feel so guilty.  Why do I keep putting her and Keisha through these times?  This is not who I was when we got married.  Our relationship was so much different then than it is now.  It seems so much harder now.  The feelings aren't always there, but my commitment is.  I don't understand why I'm feeling this way.  I wish I could be happy and not mess up the world around me.  I want this all to go away.

       No Man is an Island    urlLink Hebrews 10:24 :: NIV   I've been seeing a lot of selfishness in my own life and in others' lives.  Even now, I don't feel like giving my heart to others because I'm not feeling 100% healthy.  We can be so easily distracted by the worries of life, etc.  We all need to do our part in taking care of ourselves and each other.  In addition, we need to keep praying to God.  Write letters in a journal (this online weblog is a great venue).  Write poems, love letters to Jesus.  We all need to grow deeper in our love for him.  For help, I often go back to the  urlLink Psalms , for example.  In addition, the Bible states in Hebrews 10:25-27 that we need to consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds.  I believe this is possible.  I also believe that God has given all of us gifts to be used to serve him.  I am trying to think of my mental illness as a gift from God.  I'm not always good at doing that, but I'm trying.  The apostle Paul wrote that  urlLink God uses our weaknesses to demonstrate his power , so, Amen, then, show your power, O Lord!  I look forward to the  urlLink plans that God has for all of us .  Let me encourage you to read  urlLink Ephesians 1 .  I read that a lot this weekend, and it encouraged me so much!  It was like I was reading all of this for the first time.

       OK, But Not That Much!   In my previous  urlLink post , I mentioned that I like pizza - that it is my favorite food.  Well, I don't like it quite as much as this woman apparently did:  Kimberly Herricks, 36, a manager for Donato's Pizza, Lakewood, Ohio, was indicted in December for stealing $38,000 from the company, an amount that included the value of 400 decaying pizzas found in her garage. According to police, she had invented big call-in orders at her store for schools, hospitals, etc., just to get her store's sales figures up and her name in the company newsletter. She would then adjust the books to cover the costs and deliver the pizzas, herself, to her own garage. She was busted when she asked her boss (the owner) to help her move to a new house, and he discovered the rotting pizzas.

       Favorite Foods   Keisha and I are talking about what her favorite food of all time is, as we're getting ready to have breakfast of cereal, milk, and orange juice.  By the way, Keisha would like to say something: ggghhhhyuuuummmmdmmjjjiiiiuulppoo9yu y 77h , which she says means  "go" .  Hmm...  Anyhow, my favorite food is pizza; hers is cheeseburgers.

       A Recap During a Nightcap   Greetings, crimestoppers!  Time for a brief recap of my day (Saturday).  Started off by going to bed at 4:10 AM after watching the movies " urlLink Bounce " and " urlLink Hannibal " (quite a combination, huh?).  Naturally, it took a little while to fall asleep, having the ending of "Hannibal" still in my mind (pun not intended).  Keisha came in at about 8:30 AM as Jennie was heading to the library to return some videos ('Yes, get that 'Hannibal' film out of here!!!!").  At about 10:39 Keisha convinced me to get out of bed.  So I got up for a few seconds and then lay back down.  Finally, around 10:45 I get up for good.  Since it was late morning, we wondered if we still could have breakfast.  Keisha and I thought about that for a little bit, and then we were distracted by the nice weather outside.  Jennie came home shortly after noon, so we decided to get out of the house and get something to eat.  But we wanted some time to read our Bibles without Keisha distracting us, so we decided to go to a place that has a play area for kids - the  urlLink Burger King  in  urlLink Beavercreek, Ohio , near the  urlLink Mall at Fairfield Commons .  Silly us.  We chose the busiest place in the area.  Fortunately for me, I had some headphones as I typed into my laptop, but Jennie, I could tell, was very distracted..  About 2 PM we left an went to the  urlLink Deaf Association of Dayton on Valley Street  to hang out there for a few hours.  There we met Tom and Elizabeth from  urlLink Kettering .  Tom was born deaf, and his wife Elizabeth is a substitute teacher at  urlLink St. Rita's School for the Deaf  in Woodlawn, Ohio.  It was great learning new signs, etc.  I could tell Jennie and Keisha had fun, too.  Then we came home.  I was eager for a nap by now, but Jennie encouraged me that we should go through our mail.  We hadn't gone through it together in awhile.  Perhaps more on that another time.  Needless to say, I did the right thing and did    not    take a nap.  After working through the mail for awhile, we decided we needed a break.  So we went to  urlLink Meijer in Englewood .  We really only needed a few items, but somehow we spent a lot of time there.  It may have had something to do with Keisha and I getting split up from Jennie and those three laps around the grocery section we took looking for her.  It may have also been due to our browsing videos, pets, toys, and more.  Nevertheless, by about 9 PM, we all were pretty bushed.  So we came home put Keisha to bed after feeding her some leftover  urlLink Pizza Hut stuffed crust pizza .  Then Jennie cooked a frozen pizza we bought, and we ate it while watching the movie " urlLink Rattle and Hum " by  urlLink U2 .  Funny.  It's almost 1 AM on Sunday morning and I'm still going.  Well, not exactly.  My eyes are barely open. Even funnier are all the references to places in this entry for which I could create hyperlinks.  Perhaps later.  I'm heading for the sack.  Night everyone.  God bless.

       US Rep. Tony Hall May Have a Job Offer   According to a  urlLink local news report , Dayton Congressman Tony Hall may be asked to join President Bush's administration.  If/when he does, a special election will be held to fill the vacancy.  Dayton Republicans are endorsing former Dayton mayor Mike Turner, while Democrats have said that they would be in a bind.

       Bond, James Bond will make an 'Alias' appearance   If any of you have never seen this show,  urlLink here's  a good reason to do it.  Jennie and I make it part of our Sunday evening ritual.  We make sure Keisha is in bed between 8-9 PM so that when the show starts at 9, we are there.

      Back at work.  Getting ready to focus on the task at hand.  I am going to work on being focused and try to reduce the distractions around me.  Much thanks to my friend and brother GP for his encouragement.  He sent me an email after he heard I have ADHD.  God has definitely been working miracles in his life recently.  He's undergone much treatment for cancer, and it looks like it's helped out a lot.  I'm also encouraged about Rush Limbaugh's story regarding his hearing loss.  He recently began using cochlear implants and has regained most of his hearing loss.  Cheers to an awesome day! 8-D   6/8/2003 Update: Removed the reference to an obsolete link.

       Dream    Below is an excerpt from an email I received today from my friend Jeff:   that's weird that you email.  i actually had a dream about you and Keisha last night.  you emailed me something like this and were telling me how well keisha's piano lessons were going.  You said she only had two lessons left.  On your website you had a link to audio where she was playing beethoven quality music!  i'm going to freak out if i check out your website and there is anything remotely close to that!!!!!   Since he was wondering if there would be "anything remotely close to that", I thought I'd include the whole thing! 8-D

       Train a Child    urlLink  Bible Gateway Proverbs 22:6 :: NIV    Last night, as I tucked my daughter Keisha into bed, something happened that blew me away.  She said, "Daddy, I want to pray to God."  Since my wife Jennie or I usually initiate praying with her before she falls asleep, I was naturally surprised and very encouraged by her comment.  So we prayed together.

       Eating an Elephant   Last night I met with my psychologist.  It is quite apparent that I have some type of ADHD.  I can see problems from a global scale and get completely overwhelmed and avoid them.  At other times I get bogged down unnecessarily on details.  We discussed breaking tasks down into small, manageable pieces - pieces that I can handle and commit to doing for a short period of time.  Kinda like eating an elephant.  Eating the whole elephant is an overwhelming task when considered from a global perspective.  But, when the task is broken down into subtasks, the task is not as overwhelming.  I know this, but I haven't applied this to my life that well.  So now I start.

       Tooth Extraction   I was talking with a coworker this morning who is considering having his wisdom teeth taken out.  We've told him about our experiences, and he's a little apprehensive, not wanting it to be a horror story himself.  I got all four of my wisdom teeth taken out at once.  Before going to the oral surgeon's office, I ate some hot and spicy buffalo wings, since I knew that I wouldn't be able to eat them for awhile.  I didn't have insurance coverage (college boy supporting self fortunately had $ from co-op job and student loans), so I had to pay out of pocket.  Fortunately, I had waited until all four of them had erupted.  All the surgeon had to do was extract them; no cutting necessary.  Only local anesthesia (novocaine?) on the jaw.  So there I was.  Wide awake, yet feeling no pain... for now.  The surgeon pulled three of them out.  The last one was harder.  I remember him yanking my jaw back and forth ("Gee, you're really making me   work   for this one!" said the man getting paid over $100 per tooth.).  That hurt a little.  After it was all finished, I contacted my roommates, who picked me up.  Eager to get home, I climbed in the back seat.  Jorge, one of my roommates, wanted to check on his job application at University Hospital, so we stopped there.  What was meant to be a very quick wait wound up lasting over a half hour.  By this time I was hurting big time, and    very    eager to get home and rest.  So when that time finally arrived, I went upstairs and lay down in bed.  Some time later the phone rang.  It was Lindsey Nelson, a friend from church who was in Medical School at UC (i.e., University of Cincinnati).  "What's up?" he asked.  "I'm in pain.  I just had my wisdom teeth taken out." I muffled with my mouth full of cotton.  "Would you like a shake?" he asked. "Sure." I replied.  I hung up and went back to sleep.  Sometime later Lindsey shows up with a 32-oz homemade chocolate shake.  Now,   that   was encouraging!

       What's Going On   I have an appointment with my psychologist tonight at 6 PM.  Please pray that I can be open and that God can use this guy to really help me.  Ok. So that's about it for me.  Wait.  I've been reading this book, "The Power of a Praying Husband", by Stormie Omartian.  My wife Jennie bought it for me a few weeks ago. Also, I read something neat on Monday in  urlLink Genesis 35.1-5 .  Check it out if you get a chance.  Ok.  That's all I have right now.  Thanks for reading!

       One More Angel In Heaven   "Precious in the sight of the Lord  is the death of his saints. " -  urlLink Psalm 116:15 (NIV)   I know I'm supposed to be happy when a faithful disciple of Jesus dies because that person is going to heaven, but  urlLink this article  saddens me especially because this woman belonged to our church, and her husband used to as well.  Now because of these circumstances, their three children are thrust into the world without there mommy or daddy around.  I often struggle with thoughts of what her last moments must have been like.  It causes chills to run up and down my spine.  I am grateful for my marriage to Jennie and for having other people involved in our lives to help us.  I believe that God is in control and will work this situation out for his glory.  Nevertheless, I cannot hide how I feel about the circumstances surrounding my sister-in-Christ's death.

       Keeping Yourself Busy In Prison   Three convicts were on the way to prison. They were each allowed to take one item with them to help them occupy their time while incarcerated. On the bus, one turned to another and said, "So, what did you bring?"  The second convict pulled out a box of paints and stated that he intended to paint anything he could. He wanted to become the "Grandma Moses of Jail". Then he asked the first, "What did you bring?"   The first convict pulled out a deck of cards and grinned and said, "I brought cards. I can play poker, solitaire, gin, and any number of games."   The third convict was sitting quietly aside, grinning to himself. The other two took notice and asked, "Why are you so smug? What did you bring?"  The guy pulled out a box of tampons and smiled. He said, "I brought these."   The other two were puzzled and asked, "What can you do with those?"   He grinned and pointed to the box and said, "Well according to the box, I can go horseback riding, swimming, roller-skating...."

       Emergency Room   Yesterday our family made a trip to the emergency room.  It turned out to be a long wait for inconclusive results.  Sunday night Jennie was having abdominal and back pain, which kept her from going to sleep.  At about 1:30 AM we drove to the hospital.  Jennie was admitted at 1:40 AM.  About an hour and a half later Keisha and I were asked to go to her room.  We waited.  And tried to keep Keisha from getting into everything.  Keisha had a rough time waking up, but after about an hour, she was wide awake, as though it was daytime.  So there Jennie and I were, extremely tired, trying to keep Keisha from getting into everything in the examining room.  With the pillow Keisha brought I lay down on the floor and tried to doze off. How crazy.  No chance of getting to sleep there.  Why the long wait, we wondered.  I went to the nurses' station and asked what was taking so long.  I found out that they needed to do some tests on Jennie to try to uncover what was wrong.  I asked Jennie if she would mind if Keisha and I went out to get a bite to eat.  She said she didn't mind.  So Keisha and I got into the car, trying to dodge the freezing rain, and we drove to the ATM and then to White Castle, the closest 24-hour restaurant.  Of course they didn't have the Cinnamon rolls we wanted, so we opted for the Cheese danish and Apple danish.  We drove back to the hospital parking lot and ate our food, and then we went back inside the ER.  Nothing had changed; Jennie was still waiting, but fortunately, she had gotten a little bit of sleep.  I asked Jennie if she would mind if Keisha and I went back to the car and napped.  She said she didn't.  I told her that the hospital folks could call us on the cell phone if they needed.  So Keisha and I went back to the car and fell asleep.  At about 5:30 AM Jennie came out, having been discharged and with a prescription in hand.  It all seemed like a waste of time, to have waited so long for something that might as well been taken care of at the doctor's office.  But, I guess it's better to be safe.  Jennie and I were suprised that Keisha still wanted to go to school, having had intermittent sleep during the night.  But she insisted.  I, on the other hand, chose to stay home and take care of Jennie.  This came in handy when I go a phone call to go pick up a friend who had just had outpatient surgery.  I was able to let Jennie sleep while I picked our friend up.  I also was able to see Keisha off the school bus when it was time for her to come home.  In between these times, I got some more sleep.  In fact, at about 2:30 PM, I told Jennie I was going to take a nap.  I woke up at 8 PM.  It was indeed a crazy day.

For the past few days, the template updates don't appear to be working.  Perhaps this is an early reminder that Geocities is going to halt the practice of allowing free remote FTP's to websites under their domain.  Bummer!

       Ronald McDonald Comes to Our House, Part 1    Tonight we went through the drive thru at McDonald's, and Keisha saw a picture of Ronald McDonald.  This prompted her to say that she wants him to "come to my house."  This is what she typically says when she sees someone that she likes.  Below is an excerpt of the conversation that followed.  By the way, she's four years old.    Daddy:   Where would he stay?   Keisha:   In my room.   Daddy:   Where would he sleep?   Keisha:   On my bed.  I'd sleep on the floor.   Daddy:   Oh.  Who's toothbrush would he use?   Keisha:   My pink one that I don't use anymore.   Daddy:   What food does he like to eat?   Keisha:   He like hamburgers.   Daddy:   Really?  Does he like broccoli?   Keisha:   Yeah.   Daddy:   Cauliflower?   Keisha:   No.  He likes broccoli.   Daddy:    Peas?  Carrots?   Keisha:   No.  He likes broccoli!   Daddy:    What kind of music does he like to listen to?   Keisha:   "Jingle Bells"   Daddy:    Really?  What kind of movies does he like to watch?   Keisha:   He'll watch Barney with me.  And he can play on the 'puter (computer) with me.   Daddy:    Oh.  I see.     --- to be continued ---

       Singing Dreams, Vol. 1   I had a dream last night that I was singing for a group of people at church at a function outside, in a pavillion.  While I was singing a certain song, my microphone started to fade out.  I asked the sound guys to turn up the volume of my mike, but there was nothing they could do.  Something was wrong with the sound system, and they were unable to fix it until the show was over.  So I had to lip-sync the next song, "Shine", by the Newsboys.

       Having a Birthday (or Godly Sorrow vs. Worldly Sorrow)   Today I had a birthday.  No, not the annual kind to celebrate when I've added another year to my life.  More like a rebirth of sorts.  It was forced on me somewhat.  I had not been spending my time wisely while at work, and it was showing.  I would make excuses for why progress wasn't where it should be, but really I was just horsing around, not getting the work done.  I've had an improper work ethic.  Today it came to a head when I was given a sharp rebuke from two of my team members.  The other one was out today, but he probably could have chimed in just as much.  I was presented with an ultimatum, so to speak.  Needless to say, that got my attention.  So, I begin anew, with an improved work ethic.  I am also needing to be aware of what's going on around me.  Even if others aren't seeing what I'm doing, I know that God sees, and his opinion is what ultimately matters.  The true sign of a person's integrity is who they are when no one else is around.  I haven't been a man of integrity, that's for sure.  But I can and will keep changing.  I really want to do it for God, but I know I'll be tempted to do it to please men.  I have been reminded of this passage about godly sorrow vs. worldly sorrow:   urlLink 2 Cor. 7:10-11

       Drink Water (or Eight Things to Do with Coca Cola)   This item was sent to me by MJ over a year ago.  I cannot verify whether the information here is valid or not.   Interesting facts: Water vs. Coca Cola   * 75% of Americans are chronically dehydrated. (Likely applies to half world pop.) In 37% of Americans, the thirst mechanism is so weak that it is often mistaken for hunger.  * Even MILD dehydration will slow down one's metabolism as much as 3%.  * One glass of water shuts down midnight hunger pangs for almost 100% of the dieters studied in a U-Washington study.  * Lack of water: the #1 trigger of daytime fatigue.  * Preliminary research indicates that 8-10 glasses of water a day could significantly ease back and joint pain for up to 80% of sufferers.  * A mere 2% drop in body water can trigger fuzzy short-term memory, trouble with basic math, and difficulty focusing on the computer screen or on a printed page.  * Drinking 5 glasses of water daily decreases the risk of colon cancer by 45%, plus it can slash the risk of breast cancer by 79%, and one is 50% less likely to develop ladder cancer.  Are you drinking the amount of water you should every day?   COKE: No wonder it tastes soooo good:   1. In many states (in the USA) the highway patrol carries two gallons of Coke in the trunk to remove blood from the highway after a car accident.  2. You can put a T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two days.  3. To clean a toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl and ... Let the "real thing" sit for one hour, then flush clean. The citric acid in Coke removes stains from vitreous china.  4. To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the bumper with a crumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in Coca-Cola.  5. To clean corrosion from car battery terminals. Pour a can of Coca-Cola over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion.  6. To loosen a rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the rusted bolt for several minutes.  7. To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking pan, wrap the ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is finished, remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke for a sumptuous brown gravy.  8. To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke into a load of greasy clothes, add detergent, and run through a regular cycle. The Coca-Cola will help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze from your windshield.   FYI: -   1. The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. Its pH is 2.8. It will dissolve a nail in about 4 days.  2. To carry Coca-Cola syrup (the concentrate) the commercial truck must use the Hazardous material place cards reserved for Highly corrosive materials.  3. The distributors of Coke have been using it to clean the engines of their trucks for about 20 years.  Still Want To Drink Up?   Update, 27 March 2003:   I've been doing some research on  urlLink Snopes.com , and I found this out -- The claim that the acids in Coca-Cola not only make it a handy household cleaning product, but harmful to drink as well are   false  .  Check out the  urlLink Acid Slip  page over at Snopes.com.  You'll probably want to add  urlLink Snopes.com  to your favorites list, too.  Please accept my apology for spreading false information.

       The Test    Thanks to my friend JI who emailed this to me:   The CIA had an opening for an assassin. After all of the background checks, interviews, and testing were done there were three finalists:two men and a woman.  For the final test, the CIA agents took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun.  "We must know that you will follow your instructions, no matter what the circumstances. Inside of this room, you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Kill Her!!!"  The man said, "You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife." The agent said, "Then you're not the right man for this job."  The second man was given the same instructions.  He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about five minutes. Then the man came out with tears in his eyes.  "I tried, but I can't kill my wife."  The agent said, "You don't have what it takes.  Take your wife and go home."  Finally, it was the woman's turn.  She was given the same instructions to kill her husband. She took the gun and went into the room.  Shots were heard, one shot after another.  They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the woman.  She wiped the sweat from her brow, and said, "This gun is loaded with blanks. I had to beat him to death with the chair."

       Meeting the President   Last night I had an interesting dream.  It all started when I was on my way to school, and I didn't have a shirt to wear.  I was bare-chested.  I felt self-conscious, but since I was running a little late, I couldn't go back home to get a shirt.  I saw some guys playing basketball and went over to one of them.  He suggested I ask one of the guys who was playing if he had an extra shirt.  I did.  Then... almost immediately... the scene changed (and so does the tense).  I'm in this meeting facility and have just heard that the President of the United States is on his way to give a speech at this particular facility.  I am excited.  After some time, I hear a helicopter.  I run to the front window and notice some Secret Service men walking toward the building.  I also see some important dignitaries getting off the helicopter.  A receiving line begins to form outside in front of the entrance, and I join it.  After a little while, the President steps out of the helicopter.  But wait a minute!  No, it's not George W. Bush, the  current  US President.  It's Ronald Reagan, looking in great health, too!  He proceeds toward the receiving line and greets everyone.  He even shakes my hand!  I am so blown away to have shaken the hand of the President of the United States.  And then... the dream ends.

       The Itch   He sat there on his couch staring off into space.  Feeling numb from the congestion in his head, he sat motionless.  Then, all of a sudden, he snapped.  His face started to itch all over.  He began scratching his face.  Repeatedly.  It started to sting, and he began to notice blood on his fingernails.  His face was in pain, yet still itching badly.  So he kept scratching.  Eventually he passed out.  Some hours later he awoke.  His face felt sore, but it was no longer itching.  He examined his hands; they were bloody.  He stood up and went to the mirror.  His face looked terrible.  There were multiple gashes on his face.  He went to the bathroom and washed his hands and face.  It looked as though he had lost a fight with a cat.  How was he going to explain this to everyone?  Would they consider him weird?  Unfortunately this was something he could not hide.  Even if he covered them with band aids, he would still look strange.  And what of his parents?  He wouldn't know what to say.  He felt very embarrassed, yet relieved the itch was gone.

       That Awful Feeling in My Throat   Stayed home from work today.  Jennie, Keisha, and I have been sick.  We spent most of the day driving around going to and from doctor's appointments.  So not much rest for me today.  I might not go into work tomorrow.  Depends.  Gotta get some rest.  Actually, it's been a little hard to get rest.  I feel as though every other second, I have to swallow.  "Secretions", if you know what I mean.  Doctor said it's a sinus infection for Jennie and me.  Began taking antibiotic and some cough medicine.  Take plenty of fluids, I've been advised.   Ok, then.  Until next time, Danimal over and out

       Paranoia   Sometimes at night, when I get into my car and I'm alone, I feel a little paranoid.  Especially if I'm in a dark area.  A couple of things go through my mind:  - Hurry up, get inside the car, and lock the doors so no one else can get in - What will happen when I start the car?  Will the car explode because there's a bomb?

       Procrastination   I was thinking earlier that of all the weaknesses in my character, if I could change my procrastination, I'd be a lot better off.  I've learned recently that one of the characteristics of someone with ADHD is procrastination.  As an ADHD adult, I see this a lot in my character.  I tend to forego doing the things that are not as interesting to me or don't tend to hold my attention, for those activities that are more interesting and do tend to hold my attention.  For instance, I thought about writing this post yesterday evening, but I've waited until right now (2:11 AM EST Thursday, March 7, 2002) to actually post.  I know that I need to work on changing the procrastination in my character.  That's the easy part.  Actually making the changes is more difficult.  I think I'll work on it later.

       Rolling for Groceries   This past Sunday afternoon, I did something I never have done before.  I went to Kroger to get some stuff for lunch, and as I walked in the store, I saw a wheelchair next to all the carts.  My feet were a bit sore, so I thought, why not?  I climbed into the wheelchair and put the basket to hold my groceries down and started off.  Honestly, it felt a little weird.  It was so different, going around the store in the wheelchair.  For one thing, I had to use my arms to move the wheels.  It was also a bit strange as I interacted with other people, especially when they or I had to move out of the way to get where we were going.  I was very tempted to ask for sympathy, but I didn't, thankfully.  When I finally paid for my groceries, I wheeled myself out of the store, into the parking lot, and up to my car.  Then I got out of the wheelchair and walked it to where the other shopping carts were.  I was glad for the experience because I can better empathize with others who use wheelchairs.

       A Good Deed   He fell into a daydream.  The long line of cars on the highway looked like spaghetti noodles.  One lonely cloud rested in the sky, on this mid-summer night.  He drove along with the top down, and the summer breeze blowing his shoulder-length hair back.  He turned on the radio and heard "...a love that drips/ like honey/ sticky sweet...".  And just then he spotted a disabled vehicle on the side of the highway.  A woman was standing beside it waving a white handkerchief.  He immediately pulled over and asked what he could do to help.  Several minutes later, he lowered the hood of her car, opened the door for her to climb back in, and asked her for her phone number.  Delighted that she was no longer held captive, she said "I'll tell you what, handsome follow me to the truck stop at the next exit.  We can have lunch together."  He agreed and hopped back into his convertible.  He turned his radio on and heard U2 singing "...that was the day before love came to town..."  He sped off toward the next exit.

       Icy Wind   Last night he drove down Main Street several miles.  He made a brief stop at the pony keg for a 12-pack of beer.  The winter air was so cold that as he breathed, he could feel the chill in his chest.  It felt like the same chill he usually gets from eating ice cream too fast.  Back in the car, he drove several more miles, barely able to see anything.  Snow fell horizontally, carried along by the heavy, icy wind.  Other than the white flakes pelting his car, he could only see the flashing tailights of the cars ahead of him.  Traffic was at a slow crawl, since most were not used to driving in this weather.  After all, this was only the third time this winter that a snow storm like this came there way.  He could not help thinking about his vacation last summer, when he fell in love once more...

       Understanding Written Communication    I was inspired to write this as a result of a conversation Jennie and I had with our friend DB.  She received something in an email from another friend of ours, and what it contained seemed to disturb her.   Written communication can be difficult to understand.  Since I read words that have already been spoken, I only have that evidence to go on in order to understand the writer's message.  More exists than simply the written text.  As a reader, I must consider the following:    What is the main theme? What are the main points? What is the writer's tone? What can I get from the author's choice of words? What about the writer's style? What bias do I bring as I read? What is the mood of the piece? What mood do I bring as I read? If I know the writer, how is my relationship with him/her?    I propose that with what an author writes, he or she has put forth a challenge to potential readers:   Understand what I'm writing.    While some may consider that idea obvious, I believe it is important to examine more than simply the text an author has given us.  To truly understand an author's message, therefore, we must take an active role as we read.

       How are We [ADDers] Different?   courtesy of Bob Seay   "ADDers are no easier to stereotype than any other group of 10 to 20 million people. Within the broad umbrella of behaviors and symptoms are varied degrees of severity, ranging from mild to chronic. We know that while all hyperactive people have ADD, not all ADDers are hyperactive, or at least not physically hyperactive (mental hyperactivity is certainly a possibility). Many times, there are other factors, such as obssesive-compulsive disorder or, more commonly, depression, which co-exist with the ADD."  (from the Introduction)   urlLink more>>

       How I'm Doing   Today I haven't felt that well emotionally.  I really can't put my finger on what is wrong; I just don't feel very happy right now.  I'm probably in an ADHD funk.  I had one last night before I went to bed.  I feel a bit cynical about things going on at work - maybe that's it.  I have been a bit more focused today, but I still have trouble quieting my mind down.  One thing I've noticed lately is the songs going through my head.  Songs I've listened to years ago, out of nowhere suddenly appear in my head.  This week I've had Cheap Trick, The Police, some big band jazz, New Order, U2, and others.  Maybe that comes from listening to a lot of music often.  Oh well.  Time to call it a day here at work.

       GPS (Gullible Person Seeker)   This past weekend two other couples, along with me and my wife, did a road trip to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from Cincinnati, Ohio.  More on the purpose of the trip later.  The three of us guys do some type of computer programming for a living, and we brought our laptops with us - just in case (No, we left our pocket protectors at home.).  Well, there was more to it than that.  Mike had brought his GPS so that we wouldn't have to stop and ask for directions (Ladies, you know how hard that is for us men.).  Seriously.  He had this map software that worked with the GPS (most commonly known as "Global Positioning System").  The availability of this device most certainly prevented us from getting lost.

       Cellphones from Hell   OK, maybe that is an exaggeration.  That's just how I felt for a little while on the way home from work.  To save money, we recently switched cell phone providers.  We've had the new service for about a month so far, and I still haven't figured out what's going on with the phone.  It's rather weird in that the calls keep going to voicemail, which I have no idea how to access.  While using the hands-free unit, I got a phone call from home, and I couldn't hear my wife's voice.  She heard me, though.  Frustrated.  About ready to throw the phone against the windshield (I was driving).  I'm glad I didn't.

On Sunday, my wife threw a party for me and a woman whose birthday happens to be today, the 17th.  We've never had so many people there at our place.  It was awesome.  Many of our friends shared encouraging things about us.  I have some truly remarkable friends indeed.  Tonight we're going out to dinner to a place where the servers will come and sing "Happy Birthday" to us.  I know it sounds cheesy, but I rather like this time.

       Knowing God's Word   "The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple.  'If you are the Son of God,' he said, 'throw yourself down from here. For it is written:  	“He will command his angels concerning you 	to guard you carefully; 	they will lift you up in their hands, 	so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.”'  Jesus answered, “It says: "Do not put the Lord your God to the test.”'  --  urlLink Luke 4:9-12  (NIV)  It is vital, if we are going to resist the temptation of the Satan, that we know God's word, found in the Bible.   This passage is one of many that shows us why.  Satan tempted Jesus,   using Scripture!     Jesus put the verse Satan quoted in context, replying with more Scripture.  So, we must be careful to know God's word in its full context and should not think that this will come  by a casual, once-in-a-while, perusing of the Bible.  NO!  We must diligently study the Word ( urlLink 1 Tim. 4:16 ,   urlLink Acts 17:10-11 ).  Thank you.

       They're Dying    Forwarded from a friend via email, loosely based on U2’s “Sunday Bloody Sunday”  (1st Chorus) They’re dying, we’re dying, both sides crying And the end seems very near  Terror smiling, leaders lying, times are trying And the answer isn’t clear   The TV news shows it all to us A bloody face, an exploding bus  Orphaned children and no one cares Pain and hatred are everywhere  Making enemies out of next door friends How will we ever start over again?  Aren’t we lucky? The future’s arrived!  But I’m not betting that we’ll survive   (2nd Chorus) Towers falling, how galling, wake-up calling And they all ask you to give  Revelations, confrontation, “Battle Stations” Now we don’t have long to live   We kill each other because we can Not very fair but it’s our oldest plan  Day after day we’re stalked by death From mother’s womb to our final breath  We take lives that are not ours to keep Is there no conscience? How can we sleep?    The war draws closer, I hear the guns The bombs exploding, the beating drums!   (3rd Chorus) Time to decide, run and hide, or pick a side ‘Cause we’re headed for the end   We’ll all pay, in a big way, on judgement day Better hope you find a friend

       Words Women Use    I appreciate this much needed advice from a woman for men on how to communicate with women.  I've heard it said that communication across both hemispheres for a woman is like a superhighway, whereas for us men it's more like a dirt path.  As a result, we need all the help we can get!    FINE:  This is the word we use at the end of any argument that we feel we are right about but need to shut you up. NEVER use "Fine" to describe how a woman looks. This will cause you to have one of those arguments.   FIVE MINUTES:  This is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five minutes that your football game is going to last before you take out the trash, so it's an even trade.   NOTHING:  This means something and you should be on your toes. "Nothing" is usually used to describe the feeling a woman has of wanting to turn you inside out, upside down, and backwards. "Nothing" usually signifies an argument that will last "Five Minutes" and end with the word "Fine".   GO AHEAD (with raised eyebrows):  This is a dare.  One that will result in a woman getting upset over "Nothing" and will end with the word "Fine".   GO AHEAD (normal eyebrows):  This means "I give up" or "do what you want because I don't care". You will get a raised eyebrow "Go Ahead" in just a few minutes, followed by "Nothing" and "Fine" and she will talk to you in about "Five Minutes" when she cools off.   LOUD SIGH:  This is not actually a word, but is still often a verbal statement very misunderstood by men. A "Loud Sigh" means she thinks you are an idiot at that moment and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you over "Nothing".   SOFT SIGH:  Again, not a word, but a verbal statement.  "Soft Sighs" are one of the few things that some men actually understand. She is content. Your best bet is to not move or breathe and she will stay content.   THAT'S OKAY:  This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can say to a man. "That's Okay" means that she wants to think long and hard before paying you retributions for whatever it is that you have done. "That's Okay" is often used with the word "Fine" and used in conjunction with a raised eyebrow "Go Ahead". At some point in the near future when she has plotted and planned, you are going to be in some mighty big trouble.   PLEASE DO:  This is not a statement, it is an offer.  A woman is giving you the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have for doing whatever it is that you have done. You have a fair chance to tell the truth, so be careful and you shouldn't get a "That's Okay".   THANKS:  A woman is thanking you. Do not faint,  just say "You're Welcome."   THANKS A LOT:  This is much different from "Thanks".  A woman will say, "Thanks A Lot" when she is really ticked off at you. It signifies that you have hurt her in some callous way, and will be followed by the "Loud Sigh". Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the "Loud Sigh", as she will only tell you "Nothing".

       We Are The World, Part 2    My other friend GB replied to the first message:   What would have been worse is if he did not know how to write or read and he asked someone to write the lyrics for him and instead they wrote the lyrics to another 80's song.  "Too Shy Shy" by Kajagoogoo (1983) now that would been embrassing!  Was some solider or war vet down on the other side of the street holding a sign with the words to "Voices That Care" that We are The World type of song that came out during the gulf war (1991).

       We Are The World, Part 1    What weird acquaintences I have!  I got this email from KM:   I was on my way into work this morning and saw a man on the street who looked to be homeless with a sign with the lyrics to "We Are The World!" I tried my best the rest of the way here not to laugh especially when  people looked at me like I was a nut. I just thought it was so cheesy. Then I wondered if I was in Britain would I see a man with a sign with the lyrics to "Feed The World."

       Stargazer Blue - Review    urlLink      I recently participated in the Peer-to-Peer Review Project, in which webloggers get to review one another’s weblog.   Who knows?  Perhaps someone will review this one…   I enjoyed my recent visit to   urlLink Stargazer Blue , the weblog by “Maggie” (her randomly-generated name).  I am unsure when the weblog was begun, since I cannot yet access the archives.   I would venture to say that this blog was created recently.  On this very personal site we learn a lot about her, since she has revealed a lot of detail about herself. For example, we get to read things happening in her life when she was 3-1/2, 10, and 16.  From this information and other posts, we learn that “Maggie” is 18-19 years old and attending college somewhere in Virginia.  And then, there’s her favorites lists, where she lists items she has brand loyalty, people who are on her bad side (only three), TV shows, music, and so on.  She is not afraid to share how she’s really feeling, whether it’s about her roommate or spring break or her family.  “Maggie” appears to enjoy her online presence very much, as evidenced by the link to her Harry Potter fanfic and her passion for listening to remixes of video game music.  I have oftern wondered myself what the dance mix of the theme to "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?" would sound like.   This blog would be somewhere I would like to return to in awhile, once the layout and navigation is completed. It appears that she plans to add more links and a webcam sometime in the future.  I did follow some of the links that were included, however.  I especially like the link to the "What Muppet Am I?" quiz (I'm Fozzie, by the way.).  Stargazer Blue provides the subjective, personal touch and refreshing perspective that  we enjoy about weblogs.  I definitely look forward to coming back.

       Personal Air Conditioning   The air was hot and humid around him.  Everyone else was sweating, but he wasn't.  He was born without sweat glands.  He did, however, have his own form of air conditioning.  Some folks did not like it, unfortunately.  His method was called breaking wind.  It wouldn't usually be a problem when he was alone, but he always noticed the angry faces around him when he used his personal air conditionaing in a crowded elevator.  To his dismay, that is where he and several others were stuck.  In a crowded elevator between the 7th and 8th floors.  The air was getting rather sticky, and, just as sweating is involuntary, so was his personal air conditioner.  He was glad, for the others' sake, that his air conditioner didn't go off very often.  You see, his built-in system provided him with adequate cooling, but it was not continuous, as sweating is.  A couple hours later, he finally let go, having let the pressure build up until the proper time.  A loud sound, and then, screams of people gasping for air, could be heard in the elevator shaft.  After a few minutes, he was the only one left standing; the rest were all unconscious from the noxious vapors.

       Retribution   His side was hurting so bad that it felt like a knife had been thrust in it.  He doubled over from the pain, falling on the floor.  He knew that last bowl of ice cream was going to do him in, yet in his pride and arrogance he ate it anyway.  Now he was paying for it.  With no one around, his cries for help went unheard.  Minutes later, he awoke.  Still on the floor, his side felt a little better, yet his head was throbbing.  The only way, it seemed, to relieve the pain was to press on the affected areas as hard as he could.  He would at times hit himself with his fists.

       Daily Blah - Star Wars | Attack of the Clones - Review   Chris Taylor, who  urlLink writes the Daily Blah , posted on yesterday, May 22, 2002, an "Open Letter to Lucas".  I have to state the exact date, because, when you go to his website, you will notice that he has not added any permalinks, so that anyone could link to a particular post. (Hey Chris,  urlLink here's how to set that up .)  While I don't agree with what he says, I nevertheless found his article rather interesting.  I'll let you check it out for yourself.

       The Winner?    Thanks to my old high school classmate LH for this email.   An old native American Grandfather said to his grandson, who came to him with anger toward a friend who had done him an injustice: "Let me tell you a story. I too, at times, have felt a great hate for those that have taken so much, with no sorrow for what they have done. But hate wears you down, and does not hurt your enemy. It is like taking poison and wishing your enemy would die. I have struggled with these feelings many times."  He continued, "It is as if there are two wolves inside me; one is good and does no harm. He lives in harmony with all around him and does not take offense when no offense was intended. He will only fight when it is right to do so, and in the right way. He saves all his energy for the right fights.  But the other wolf, ah! He is full of anger. The littlest thing will set him into a fit of temper. He fights everyone, all the time, for no reason. He cannot think because his anger and hate are so great. It is helpless anger, for his anger will change nothing.  Sometimes it is hard to live with these two wolves inside me, for both of them try to dominate my spirit."  The boy looked intently into his Grandfather's eyes and asked, "Which one wins, Grandfather?"  The Grandfather smiled and quietly said, "The one I feed."  -- Native American Author Unknown

       New Look and Feel   Check out the new look of this weblog.  It has a built-in  urlLink Google Search , in which you can search the entire internet or one of my weblogs.    I've also broken out some of the posts to this weblog into their own categories.  Oh, and by the way, it's not that I like this green color per se; I just think that it goes well with the rest of the layout.  Comments, questions, thoughts?

       Hallelujah! : urlLink Permalinks to Blog*Spot posts work!   For those of you who may not understand, every time I refer to a specific post from a weblog hosted by Blog*Spot (one of mine or someone else's), the link would get messed up by being directed to a link with a '?' in it.  The result was often that you would get the main archive page that had the post on it, but you would also need to search for the post within that page.  Now, apparently, the links work the way they were intended to, by getting you directly to the post you were looking for.  Cheers!

       Health | Ending Self-Injury  from the  urlLink Lysamena Project on Self-Injury   Well, folks, I am in need of some baring of the soul here.  Since I was about seven years old, I have engaged in self-injury practices.  Specifically, if I've had a cut or scab of some kind, I struggle with just letting it heal.  I have trouble resisting the urge to pick at scabs.  I am currently seeking medical help for this and some other mental stuff that I'm dealing with (namely, ADHD, obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder, depression).  I know that what I'm doing to my body isn't normal, and I know that it affects those around me.  I get embarrassed by the scabs and scars on my body.  I did a  urlLink Google Search  on self injury and found this web page, about   urlLink ending self-injury .  It is categorized under  urlLink Health > Mental Health > Disorders > Impulse Control > Self Injury .  I am glad to be open about this, and I know that I'm not the only one struggling with it.  I would love to be free from this habit right now, but I understand that it will take patience, time, and the hand of God.  So I urge you to pray for me.  Thanks.

       "Hey, dude! What's with the links, man? Some of them are all lowercase and othes have a 'category' in front of them."   I am striving toward consistency and better organization: a similar look to all the links, and similar posts listed closer together.  Of course, this means that I am editing each individual link.  You may  urlLink recall from an earlier post  that I'm looking for a free search engine that we all can use to search for stuff on this blog.  Having posts categorized may help out with this effort.

       Star Wars | Critics Reviews   Everyone's a critic, and they are entitled to their own opinions, varied though they may be.  I'm glad that the folks at  urlLink Yahoo! Movies   urlLink have presented a rather thorough list of opinions .  Interesting story:  In 1977 my Dad took me to see  urlLink Star Wars: A New Hope  three times at the movie theater.  Later, when he started dating my future step-mother, he took her to the "Drive-In" to see a movie he was sure she'd enjoy.  That movie was "Star Wars".  Unfortunately, she was not as impressed as he was.

This is exactly the same type of message for the   sulfnbx.exe 'virus'   that circulated our systems about a month ago.   It tries to persuade you to delete a file they claim is a virus...however, it is a legitimate Windows file from your computer.   "The file that the [current] hoax refers to,   Jdbgmgr.exe  , is a   Java Debugger Manager  . It is a Microsoft file that is installed when you install Windows.  "It does have a teddy bear icon as described in the hoax.  While this is, in an of itself, NOT a virus, if you delete the file, it has the same effect as a virus... it messes up your system.  "You may want to emphasize to anyone who sends these to you, that when a virus is real and is supposed to do the damage this message implies, there will be major news coverage (e.g. the I Love You virus)....[we] will send warnings and they will get the information from legit sources... not just 'a friend'.  "Also, before they e-mail this type of thing, stongly encourage them check with the  urlLink Symantec  or  urlLink McAfee  web sites.

       Email | My travels    forwarded courtesy of my friend Jeff:   I left Abingdon heading toward Myrtle Beach, when I decided to stop at a rest stop. The first stall was occupied, so I went into the second one. I was no sooner seated than I heard a voice from the next stall:   "Hi, how are you doing?"    I am not the type to chat with strangers in highway comfort stations, and I really don't know quite what possessed me, but anyway, I answered, a little embarrassed:   "Not bad."    And the stranger said: "And, what are you up to?"    Talk about your dumb questions!  I was really beginning to think this was too weird! So I said:   "Well, I guess that just like you I'm driving east."    Then, I heard the stranger, all upset, say, "Look, I'll call you back, there's some idiot in the next stall answering all the questions I am asking you."

       Mapping the Star Wars Mythology  from  urlLink CNN.com    Lucas said "Star Wars" fans will learn a little more about what attracted Anakin Skywalker to the dark side in "Episode II."  "In this film, you begin to see that he has a fear of losing things, a fear of losing his mother, and as a result, he wants to begin to control things, he wants to become powerful, and these are not Jedi traits," he said. "And part of these are because he was starting to be trained so late in life, that he'd already formed these attachments. And for a Jedi, attachment is forbidden." urlLink more>>

       UGHHH! :  I've been struggling with my PC here at work.  Between server restarts, unwanted company email (I'm a contractor working onsite), and functionality that behaves one way one day and differently the next - it all can get frustrating.  (blows off steam)  I think I'm just gonna continue listening to my music and get as far as I can...  In the words that my friend and brother MM told me:  Keep on rollin', 18-wheeler.

       Traffic Bothers   I tend to get upset by people in other cars who don't use turn signals.  What often bugs me is when I'm waiting to make a turn, and an oncoming car looks as if it might turn, or maybe it won't.  I can't tell until the very last moment.  I know I'm impatient, but I could use that extra time to get where I want to go.  Another thing that bugs me is when I'm behind someone and they slow down to turn - and don't use their turn signal!  Or yet, those folks that are about to turn left and slow down without going into the middle, or "suicide" lane.  Here these goofballs are, impeding the flow of traffic by their selfish driving.  If someone's turn signals are out, that's no excuse!  That's what hand signals are for!  Geez!  We need to learn this to take the cotton-pickin' driver's test, so why can't these people put their hand out and make a   constructive   gesture for once?  Now, I've been guilty of these motoring "sins", so it's not good to cast the first stone if I'm not at fault.  Yet I still think it's time... yes, it's time for all of us to change!     Just be sure to signal.

       Work for the Crime... Great Story   "It seems like something straight out of a Simpsons script, but it really happened.  "In Monroe, Washington, yesterday, armed bandits broke into a Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) coffee shop and forced employees to open the safe. The contents apparently weren't enough to buy more than a few cups of Mocha Coconut Frappuccino, however, so the thieves immediately began thinking of ways to increase their loot.  "And, thus, for the next 30 minutes, they served coffee, lattes, and cappuccinos to drive-thru customers. After collecting enough cash (and a half-hour was plenty with the price of Starbucks products), the thieves calmly got in their vehicle and drove away... and haven't been heard from since.

       Married and Faithful    urlLink Jen , who  urlLink recently signed my guestmap ,  urlLink posted some questions  related to married people who struggle with infidelity.  I do not consider myself to be an expert on marriage - I've only been married for 7 years - but since I do have a little bit of experience, I'll share what I believe.  First of all, my wife and I are committed followers of Jesus Christ.  We consider our individual relationships with God as paramount to any other relationship.  Secondly, our relationship with each other is more important than family, friends, etc.  Since our wedding day, we both have taken our vows seriously.  The gushy emotions we felt during the first year of marriage have not persisted.  It is the love we each have for God and for each other that has kept us together.    9 Two are better than one,  because they have a good return for their work:  10 If one falls down,  his friend can help him up.  But pity the man who falls  and has no one to help him up!  11 Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm.  But how can one keep warm alone?  12 Though one may be overpowered,  two can defend themselves.  A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.   -- Ecclesiastes 4:9-12 (NIV)    Here is another way to look at it:  God, my wife, and I are at each corner of a triangle.  He does not move.  As Jennie (my wife's name) and I move closer to God, we get closer to each other by default.  So the key to having a healthy marriage is for each person to stay close to God.  This relates to the subject of infidelity.  Early in our marriage I used to believe that I wouldn't struggle with lust.  After all, I'm married now!  I was naive.  As I mentioned before, the gushy feelings we had have not always been there, but our commitment to each other has.  I have found that when I am not close to God, I tend to be open toward stuggles with lust.  Remember the triangle: If we move away from God, we also move away from each other.  Keeping a healthy marriage is hard work!  One should not think it any other way.  It involves daily renewing our vows.  It also involves a lot of grace and forgiveness - from God and from each other.  Having other spiritually mature couples in our lives has also been important.  But most important of all, is our commitment to God.  If you are interested in learning more about getting a better relationship with God, I can help.  Feel free to contact me and leave a way that I can reply.

"Walking into either of these caves is like stepping into a (sweltering) gigantic geode," described one awed observer. Some of the translucent selenite crystals are over 20 feet long. The newly-discovered caverns, 1200 feet below Chihuahua, carry a curse for those who seek to plunder their riches. A man recently tried to steal one of the magnificent crystals from the roof, and might have succeeded... if he hadn't stood directly beneath it while chopping it free. He was crushed by the stalactite as it heeded the call of gravity.  Reference: Discovery (Channel) News

       Dog Days of Summer - Already    Disclaimer:  Please do not read this if you have a delicate stomach or are eating or have just eaten.   Two weeks ago we got a four-month old puppy.  He's part Chocolate Lab and part Collie.  We are struggling with killing this dog - over housebreaking.  OK, I'm not serious about killing the dog - I'd never do that.  But I am letting it upset me.  We also bought a cage, in which he sleeps.  The idea behind having Jake (the dog's name) sleep in the cage is based upon the dog's natural instinct not to relieve himself where he sleeps.  We also put him in the cage whenever we go out of the house to go grocery shopping or whatever.  Yet when we're at home, we let him out and take him outside to relieve himself.  When he's inside, we need to make sure that he isn't unsupervised.  He's been known to pee and poop from time to time.  Case in point:  Not even 10 minutes ago, we had just finished dinner, and I'm sitting here typing at the computer when I smell dog poop.  I noticed that Jake had somehow gotten downstairs.  I sent him back upstairs and looked around to see where the dog had been, and, sure enough, he left a  poop pile  on the carpet!  I ran upstairs to get the pooper scooper and came back downstairs.  As I approached to poop, the smell got to me.  I felt it coming.  So I ran to the garbage can and  threw up .  Tasha, the deaf woman who, with her 10 month old son, lives in this area of the house, took the pooper scooper and went to pick it up.  Then  she  started gagging.  I knew what was coming for her, and of course, that prompted the gag reflex in me.  So I ran to the stationary tub and  threw up two more times .  Then Tasha came running to the downstairs bathroom, which is located next to the stationary tubs, and  vomited .  Hearing her vomiting again prompted the gag reflex in me again, and I  threw up two more times .  Keisha, our four-year old daughter, just attempted to come downstairs.  I told her to stay upstairs.  She isn't wearing her hearing aids, so she said, "What?" and I heard her begin the descent.  "Stay upstairs, Keisha!"  Then I yelled, just to make sure she heard me, "STAY UPSTAIRS, KEISHA!!!" ( I'm such a sensitive dad, aren't I? )  Then she went running, crying to her mom.  "Daddy's mad at me, Mommy!"  Soon afterward, Tasha came downstairs, with a t-shirt tied around her mouth and nose (I wish I had the camera), and  heroically  used the pooper scooper to clean up the mess.  Immediately, she put it,  pooper scooper and all , in a plastic bag.  At first I told her that we needed to keep the pooper scooper (I'm having fun typing that, by the way), but then I realized that it was better over all, at least for the short term, to have the mess out of the house.  Later, Tasha came back down with some Lysol (TM, just in case it's needed, you know) cleaner and cleaned up the area.  Well, I think I need to go soon.  I need to floss my teeth, if you know what I mean.

       Silliness:  "The Computer..."    This afternoon my four year old daughter Keisha and I were making a birthday card on the computer for one of her friends.  We had to wait for the computer to boot up, so I used this opportunity to kid around with her.  Below is how our conversation went:   D: The computer is waking up. K: NO!!!  The computer's not waking up! D: Oh! I see!  Well, then the computer is taking a bath. K:  NO!!! The computer doesn't take a bath! D: Well, the computer needs to go potty... K: NO!!! You silly!  The computer doesn't go potty! D: Well, the computer has to eat breakfast... K: NO!   By this time, she started getting into it, and more silliness erupted.  Later this evening, at the dinner table, I mentioned this to my wife Jennie and our friend Tasha, and we continued the silliness:   J: I know!  The computer has to wash the dishes! K: NO!!! T: The computer is my fiance. D: The computer needs a spanking. K: NO!!! The computer goes to McDonald's! T: The computer and Keisha go to the McDonald's and play in the play area together. J: The computer needs to go for a walk. D: The computer needs his diaper changed.   And so on...  Can you add to the silliness?  Fill in the blank:  The computer...

       Ozone Action Day 2   More from the  urlLink  Dayton Daily News  : "Summer [arrived at 9:24 am this morning] with a warning:  If you have respiratory problems, stay indoors.    "The  urlLink Regional Air Pollution Control Agency  late Thursday issued for the second consecutive day an 'Ozone Action Day,' or smog alert, for today. Jim Gross, supervisor of monitoring and analysis, said that means there will be elevated ozone concentrations over the valley-trapped combinations of pollutants, mostly from automobile emissions.  "Temperatures will rise to the upper 80s today and near 90 Saturday under mostly sunny skies. Overnight lows will be in the mid- to upper 60s. More clouds late in the weekend should bring a chance of a shower or thunderstorm."   I really didn't feel like mowing the lawn this afternoon anyway.  I think I'll wait until evening.

       Blog Update   Hey!  It's a familiar look!  That's right.  I've spent part of the afternoon copying and pasting code into my new template.  A couple things still need to be worked out.  For instance, why, when you click on the "bottom of page" link, is it that it does not take you to the bottom?  I've check the html for both the top and bottom links, but only the top link works. (sighs in frustration)   6/9/2003 Update:  Of course, I've removed the top and bottom links altogether with the current template.

       So, You Think Your Job Is Bad?    Note: A while back a friend forwarded this to me.  I cannot vouch for its validity and its presentation here is not meant to be authoritative.   When you have an "I hate my job" day try this:  On your way home from work, stop at your pharmacy and go to the thermometer section.  You will need to purchase a rectal thermometer made by "Q-tip"  Be very sure that you get this brand.  When you get home,  lock your doors, draw the drapes and disconnect the phone so you will not be disturbed during your therapy.   Change to very comfortable clothing,  such as a sweat suit and lie down on your bed.  Open the package and remove the thermometer.  Carefully place it on the bedside table so that it will not become chipped or broken.   Take out the written material that accompanies the thermometer and read it. You will notice that in small print there is a statement:       "Every rectal thermometer made by Q-tip is personally tested."  Now, close your eyes and repeat out loud five times, "I am so glad I do not work in quality control at the Q-tip Company."

       Credit Bureau Personal Information - How to Opt Out   Just wanted to let everyone know who still hasn't already heard, the three major credit bureaus in the US (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) have been allowed, as of July 1, 2001, to release our credit info, mailing addresses, phone numbers..... to anyone who requests it.  If you would like to 'opt out' of this release of info, you can call 1-888-567-868 (1-888-5-OPT-OUT). It only takes a couple of minutes to do, and you can take care of others in your household while making only one call, you'll just need to know their social security numbers. Be sure to listen closely, the first opt out is only for 2 years, but you may want to make sure you wait until they prompt you to press '3' on your keypad to opt out for good.  However, this number is not associated with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which has allowed banks and other financial institutions to sell your private financial information since July 1, 2001. Calling 1-888-5-OPT-OUT will not stop your bank, credit union, brokerage company, etc. from selling your information. For that, you must respond individually to the "Privacy Policy" statements you received in the mail or you must call the financial institution or company yourself.  Those "Privacy Policy" statements tend to get mixed in with the other "Junk Mail" you receive from your financial institutions.  This link takes you to a list of some credit card companies and financial institutions and their individual 'opt-out' numbers:  urlLink http://www.clarkhoward.com/topics/opt_out.html

       Update on me   It's been a while since I've been able to post anything "  substantial  " (I used that word, tongue-in-cheek, since there are those who may wonder if *  anything  * I post here is substantial).  So, a brief update is in order (you know, the sometimes obligatory 'sorry I haven't posted in awhile but here's why' message)...  Tomorrow (Friday, 6/14) is my last day at my current consulting assignment.  On Monday I get to return to my company's office to be "on the bench", as it is called.  Too much to go into here about how all this has happened, but you may be able to get a clue from reading recent posts to  urlLink Letters to God .  I have not been online very much lately, and when I am, I usually have had just enough time to check email and other stuff.  I haven't subscribed to  urlLink BloggerPro , but I do sometimes email myself a potential post from work.  You may find that  urlLink Letters to God  and  urlLink Quotes Blog  have been updated more frequently than this one.  So, I guess that's it for now.  I appreciate those of you who have boldly come to take this " urlLink Journey Inside My Mind ".  Maybe you'll find something here that you can take with you.  Keep in touch!

      There is certainly an over-abundance of anecdotal "religious" chain e-mails clogging up many of our inboxes already, and in my opinion most are either overly sentimental to the point of manipulative, completely fictional (not factual, like the Bible), or downright doctrinally unsound.  And of course most include the none-too-subtle hint (threat) near the end that failure to propagate them further indicates a lack of love for Jesus and/or your friends.  I love both, and yet I refuse to circulate the vast majority of those which I receive.

         I have been out of it for the past few days.  I went to the doctor on Saturday for a sore throat, and he diagnosed me with the onset of a sinus infection.  The symptoms went away for a bit later that day.  Then, on Sunday night, my head started hurting - I could tell my sinuses were filling up. (I know... yuk!)  I called into work late Sunday night to tell them I wouldn't be coming in on Monday.  Then I spent most of Monday asleep.  I didn't even go outside yesterday.  I barely ate anything: two slices of peanut butter toast, two tacos and a helping of green beans.  For the entire day, that's all I ate.  Then I went to bed last night feeling slightly better.  But when I woke up this morning, I said, "No way", and I called into work again sick.  Sinus infections wear me out.  I think it is mainly the sinus headaches.  Time to draw near to God...  I definitely haven't been myself; that's for sure.

The congregation had been studying many different  urlLink DPI  publications over the previous year, and had been attempting to imitate our Bible talks, studies and discipling principles.

       Deaf Culture   I have had the pleasure of meeting a good number of deaf people.  One of the more interesting aspects of communicating with them in sign language is the concept of a "sign name," which I'll explain briefly.   In order to keep from having to fingerspell a person's name every time you mention them, it's easier to have a "sign name."  This consists of the fingerspelled first letter of the person's name and an action associated with that person.  Whenever I've asked one of my deaf friends to give someone else to whom we're talking a sign name, they usually ask, "What does he/she like to do?"  In other words, if you had one activity or word to describe you, what would that be?  My wife Jennie, for example, has a beautiful smile.  Keisha, our 5-year old daughter, has curly hair.  I really enjoy playing and listening to music.  So our sign names, respectively, with the right hand, are a fingerspelled "J" across the right side of the face (smile), a fingerspelled "K" by the right side of the head in a curling motion (curly hair), and a fingerspelled "D" in a figure-eight motion across the left arm (music).

       My Earliest Memory, TV Superheroes, and I Have Bionic Parts     urlLink Melanie from "The Topics Blog" asks, "What was the worst thing that you have ever experienced physically?"    All right, then.  Here goes.  This is a little  personal , and maybe a little   gross   -- consider yourself  warned .  This event happens to be  my earliest memory .  I was three years old and I had received an operation to repair a hernia in my groin.  The problem arose when I had an allregic reaction to the catgut stitches that the surgeons used to knit me back up.  The area got infected and, before I could get the stitches out, they needed to get all the pus out.  I remember this scene vividly because when they pushed to squeeze the pus out, the pain was   excruciating  !  I remember screaming and crying because it hurt so bad.  I felt helpless.  After the experience was over, the hospital people gave me a Batman colorforms set for " being so brave ".  In addition to  Batman , some of my other favorite TV shows were  Shazaam!  and  The Six Million Dollar Man .  Sometimes, Mom would safety pin a towel on my back, and I would race down the steps to our front door and cry out, "  Shazaam!  ", just like the main character did on the show.  Then I would go around looking for problems to fix, bad guys to beat up, and so on.  At other times, I would play with my Steve Austin, Six Million Dollar Man, action figure.  It even had a magnifying glass so that I could look through his right eye, just like the "real" Steve Austin did on TV.  I remember after coming home from the hospital, we had a family reunion of some type at our house.  Well, I was just so proud, having come off the operating table, that I went around telling people that  I, too, had bionic parts inside me .  And I was just about to show someone by climbing up in one of the trees in front of our house, when Dad caught me.  From that moment throughout my childhood I was not allowed to climb any trees.  I thought Dad just didn't believe, but now I realize that he did want me to go back to the hospital so soon after coming home.  I cannot remember, but maybe a jump like that is what led to my operation in the first place.

       Get That Job!   I am pleased to announce the launch of "Get That Job!", a weblog devoted entirely to the job search.  The idea is to have many contributors - i.e., not just me - who can post to the page.  It could be a snippet of advice, a good quote from somewhere, some encouragement, success stories, job market information, etc.  This idea is similar to the one at  urlLink The End of Free .  So, if you happen to be interested in contributing, let me know by  urlLink emailing me , adding a comment(aka guidepost, see the end of this post),  urlLink signing the guestmap , or  urlLink signing the guestbook .  Also, if you know someone else who may be interested, then let me know about them as well.  I will need valid email addresses so that I can set you up to contribute.  Maybe you or others aren't interested in being regular contributors but would like to contribute occasionally.  In that case  urlLink email me  with whatever you have and it will be considered for posting here.

       Sleep Study   Last Friday, Jen, who blogs to Thinking by Smell,  urlLink wrote about being in a sleep study .  That's interesting.  I was part of a sleep study over ten years ago when I lived in the Detroit, Michigan area.  The researchers were testing to see how drowsy a person taking Benadryl gets.  The first week was going to be a baseline test (i.e., a control test)  I was told that I could not take in any caffeine or chocolate 12 hours before I was to go in.  They should have just put me in jail or something.  I went in at the approved time and also went to a "hook up" room.  Shortly after they turned off the lights, I was out.  They woke me up in the morning, and boy, did I feel wasted.  They let me eat breakfast, but I was not to drink any caffeine still.  After the breakfast break, I went to a computer terminal and had to take this manual dexterity test.  I was supposed to get a perfect score, considering I hadn't been given any of the Benadryl.  But because I was still so sleepy, every cell in my body begging for rest, I didn't get a good score.  Later that week, I received a check in the mail and was told that they would not need me any more for the current sleep study.  I know it was because I was a poor control guinea pig.  I've considered participating in additional studies because participants get paid.  Maybe soon...

       Our Ballerina   Keisha, as one of her 5 year old birthday presents, began dance class last night.  She was so hyped!!  And proud, too!  I get so encouraged when she shows us what she's learned.  She made a new friend, and she invited her and her mom to come to our church... Jennie was so inspired by that.  Me too!  Some people need to be told to evangelize, but this girl did it out of the bottom of her heart.  She was like this as we approached her birthday party, which was last Friday-Saturday (another post altogether).  Anyone we'd meet, whether at church, while shopping, at the doctor's office, at the library - she'd ask them if they would come to her birthday party.  We'd only invited five other girls, so when Keisha did this, we'd have to make sure these people knew that it had already been planned.  Still, we are so fired up about our daughter's natural exuberance!  It's as though whenever she walks into the room, she needs to make sure others know that she's arrived.  Now I understand that this behavior can be taken to the extreme and appear conceited.  Yet she has a magnetism that naturally draws people to her.  That's a great quality!

       Take me out to the ball game   On Monday night, my friend BI took me to see the Cincinnati Reds vs. the Pittsburgh Pirates.  It was the first time I've seen a Reds game that close this year.  This year, by the way, is the last year that the Reds will be playing in Cinergy Field, formerly known as Riverfront Stadium.  Next year they will be moving into their new ballpark, Great American Ballpark, named for Great American Insurance Company.  In general, it was a terrific time.  BI was the best man in my wedding, and I was a groomsman in his wedding.  I still refer to him as  'the best man' .  The Reds lost 6-5.

       Family Tree Research   Ah yes, another one of my hobbies.  I am always intrigued by those who have been successful in this venture.  I used to work with someone who would plan his summer vacations as a result of his research; going to ancestors' hometowns, etc.  I recently checked out Family Tree Maker's software from the local public library.  Now I need to set time to check it out.  I also found  urlLink this article , first is a series, about doing geneaology research.

       I want to learn about .NET, continued    Many of these links I'm posting have come from old emails I received from former coworkers.  The comments I include here are from one person.    urlLink  Webcasts  :  "These are great.  You can watch previously recorded webcasts or participate in a live web cast.  Also, I have been able to download a previously recorded webcast and view it when I am not attached to the network.  Great for laying on the couch and learning .NET"   urlLink  GotDotNet.com  :  "This site is a wealth of information.  The ASP.NET QuickStart is a series of ASP.NET samples and supporting commentary designed to quickly acquaint developers with the syntax, architecture, and power of the ASP.NET Web programming framework.  The QuickStart samples are designed to be short, easy-to-understand illustrations of ASP.NET features."   urlLink MSDN : "MSDN has an ample amount of .NET stuff to learn.  A good place to look at is the six-week orientation for all things .NET.  Each week, we will focus on a particular aspect of .NET development, supported by articles, samples, how-tos, chats, and Webcasts."  Also, there is somewhere something called the "Partner readiness Advisor for Visual Basic .NET and .NET Development."  This contains information about ADO,net, c#, .net, asp.net, web services and the execution of the .net platform.  In order to open it, you need IE 6.0.  If anyone out there knows where I can find this "Partner readiness Advisor", please let me know and I'll update this post.

"If the Ohio department or agency is not listed in the telephone directory's white pages under 'State Government,' dial 285-6600.  "That number connects [you with] 'Dial direct to all departments.'  Operators then connect you toll-free to the state agency you want to ask information."

       Time Management   I'm reading a book I got from the library about non-traditional methods of time management.  I like it because it takes into account people like me, who don't often think of time linearly, which is how much of our day tends to be structured.  For instance, I would find a job on an assembly line almost unbearable because I'd find it dull, boring, monotonous, routine, mind-cramping, brain-atrophying... and so on.  I also like the book because there are some great quotations that I plan to add to my  urlLink QuotesBlog .  Stay tuned!

       Five Years Ago    I am, for some odd reason, still awake, even though it's after 3 AM   On Thursday, July 17, 1997, at 10:42 PM, our daughter  urlLink Keisha Renee  was born.  This occurred after much hard work and perseverance.  And, oh yes, my wife was there, too! (just kidding, Jen!)  Seriously though -- seeing my wife go through labor generated a whole new dimension of respect for her in me.  I am glad that I will never have to experience that!  I may actually reveal some details about what happened prior to the delivery that day... at some later date.  Tonight we went to  urlLink Max and Erma's on Miller Lane to celebrate.  We all got dressed up:  I in my suit and tie from earlier today;  urlLink Jennie  in a nice outfit that made her look even more beautiful, and Keisha in a nice light blue dress, sporting a tiara and some earrings her speech therapist brought over today.  "Princess" Keisha was beaming as she walked around and sat down.  We let her open two presents as we ate dessert.  She exclaimed, "I'm so happy!" after she opened them up to find a Barbie and a baby care accessory case for her doll baby Hannah.   (Baby Hannah, by the way, is practically an additional member of the family, thanks to our daughter.  We, however, left her in the  car seat, locked up in the car with the windows closed .  I am glad that she is only a doll because we sure could have gotten in trouble!!! lol)   I am continually amazed at the miracle we see in our daughter Keisha, our gift from God.  For it was only a short time ago that I held her in the crook of my arm, rocking her to sleep.  I miss those times when I'd lay her on my chest and we'd both fall asleep on the couch.  Now she's 44 inches tall, and I can barely pick her up.  She also wants more of her independence.  From what I've heard, this is just the beginning...

       Pet Peeve -- Ohio Bicentennial License Plates   Ohio will be celebrating its bicentennial in 2003.  Last September, Ohio began issuing Bicentennial license plates to help commemorate the occasion.  They have red, white, and blue on them, which also makes it patriotic.  These license plates have been a hit, especially considering the renewed patriotism in America.  The designers of this license plate have had to make some changes in the layout to accomodate the additional information.  One of these changes is the county where the license plate holder lives.  (Growing up, our family would often travel from Cincinnati to Toledo where my dad grew up.  One of the ways we'd pass the time is to notice the license plates of the cars around us.  We'd be interested in those from out of state and those from Canada (Ontario), and we'd also notice the different Ohio counties represented.  This tradition is something we still whenever we drive.  It was easy to note which cars are from which county because it was spelled out on the bottom center of the license plate.)  The Ohio Bicentennial license plate now has a small square county sticker with a number corresponding to the alphabetical order of the county in the list of all 88 counties.  For example, I live in Dayton, Ohio, which is in Montgomery county.  In the alphabetical list Montgomery is the 57th county.  I often travel to Cincinnati and back, so I pass through Warren (83), Butler (09), and Hamilton (31).  Now, below this large number is the name of the county, but it is in very small letters.  These numbers are fine and dandy if you've memorized the alphabetical list of the counties.  But who in Ohio has done that?  My guess is that very few, if any, know them all by memory.  (Actually, this was something we had to memorize when I was studying Ohio history in junior high school.  At the time, I didn't think I would need to remember.)  My fellow Ohioans don't appreciate me tailgating them to see which county they are from.  So, what am I to do?  Well, I have compiled the alphabetical list for me personally, and for whomever else is interested.  So here goes:                      01      ADAMS      45      LICKING            02      ALLEN      46      LOGAN            03      ASHLAND      47      LORAIN            04      ASHTABULA      48      LUCAS            05      ATHENS      49      MADISON           06      AUGLAIZE      50      MAHONING            07      BELMONT      51      MARION            08      BROWN      52      MEDINA            09      BUTLER      53      MEIGS            10      CARROLL      54      MERCER            11      CHAMPAIGN      55      MIAMI            12      CLARK      56      MONROE            13      CLERMONT      57      MONTGOMERY            14      CLINTON      58      MORGAN            15      COLUMBIANA      59      MORROW            16      COSHOCTON      60      MUSKINGUM            17      CRAWFORD      61      NOBLE            18      CUYAHOGA      62      OTTAWA            19      DARKE      63      PAULDING            20      DEFIANCE      64      PERRY            21      DELAWARE      65      PICAWAY            22      ERIE      66      PIKE            23      FAIRFIELD      67      PORTAGE            24      FAYETTE      68      PREBLE            25      FRANKLIN      69      PUTNAM            26      FULTON      70      RICHLAND            27      GALLIA      71      ROSS            28      GEAUGA      72      SANDUSKY            29      GREENE      73      SCIOTO            30      GUERNSEY      74      SENECA            31      HAMILTON      75      SHELBY            32      HANCOCK      76      STARK            33      HARDIN      77   SUMMIT            34      HARRISON      78      TRUMBULL            35      HENRY      79      TUSCARAWAS            36      HIGHLAND      80      UNION            37      HOCKING      81      VAN WERT            38      HOLMES      82      VINTON            39      HURON      83      WARREN            40      JACKSON      84      WASHINGTON            41      JEFFERSON      85      WAYNE            42      KNOX      86      WILLIAMS            43      LAKE      87      WOOD            44      LAWRENCE      88      WYANDOT

       Winning is Important!!!   I know some who say that it's not important whether you win or lose, but it's how you play the game.  Well, we  urlLink got one of those last night in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA , as, for the first time since 1961, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game ended with a tie: National League 7, American League 7.  As a fan, I don't agree with that above statement.  I feel cheated.  I am from Cincinnati, and the  urlLink Reds  urlLink   had one player,  urlLink Adam Dunn , a former Dayton Dragon, on the National League team.  Given that in the last several All-Star Games, the AL won, that the NL was so close to winning hurts more.  Oh, I'll get over it.  In fact, in the grand scheme of things, it's not that big of a deal.  Yet I can't help feeling robbed.  Major League Baseball, since the strike of 1994, has not been that appealing.  Then we get a no-decision like we had last night.  Now there is talk of a strike this year.  Oh, great.  A glimmer of hope has been the arrival of minor league baseball in Dayton, Ohio.  Fifth Third Field, which seats over 8,000, is always packed, and the Dragons always provide an entertaining experience.    This feels like baseball the way it was when I grew up.  I remember the Big Red Machine of the 70's fondly.  My hero was George Foster.  When I played Little League, I had his number (3) and played his position (Left Field).  I nevertheless couldn't hit very well, and he was a slugger.  I guess we weren't meant to be alike in every way.  How will this season end up?  The Reds are in a pennant race for the NL Central division with the St. Louis Cardinals.  I'd love to see them win the division.  Whether we'll get a chance to see this depends on the outcome of the strike talks and how the teams fare.  I just hope someone wants to win.

       Personal Example Counts     "Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers."   --  urlLink 1 Timothy 4:16 (NIV)   I am outraged by the events  urlLink depicted in this story .  If the events are found to be true, then we have another case of so-called "Christians" giving Christianity a bad name by their bad example, which will neither save them nor their hearers.

       How literature has influenced our speech today    urlLink b-may  points out that he "couldn't help but notice all the turns of phrase and common references the play has added to even today's everyday conversation."  The play he's referring to his Shakespeare's    urlLink Macbeth   .  I remember way back in high school our senior English class studied this play.  I was really into jazz music, and I also remember listening to the  urlLink Manhattan Transfer's album Vocalese .  The song "Sing Joy Spring" has the lyric:  What was it from   MacBeth  ? "Life's but a walking shadow a player poor that struts and frets upon the stage and's seen no more A tale that truly has an idiotic ring That's full of lotsa sound and fury signifying nothing..."

I was voted "Most Likely to Succeed" in high school. 4. I have never been further west than San Antonio, Texas, USA 5. The only foreign country I've ever visited was Canada (Windsor, Ontario) - wait a minute... are they still a foreign country or have we annexed them yet?

       Bloginality Update   I mentioned  urlLink earlier  that I needed to find out what my Bloginality was.  I actually took the Myer-Briggs Type Indicator test in the fall of 1997 when I was in between jobs to help me on my job search.  My type then was ENFJ.    Now I'm looking for a job again, so... let's see whether it has changed or not (takes some time to take the test):  My  urlLink  Bloginality   is still  urlLink ENFJ !!!  Let's  urlLink find out  a little bit about what this means:  "The dynamic nature of their intuition moves ENFJs from one project to another with the assurance that the next one will be perfect, or much more nearly so than the last. ENFJs are continually looking for newer and better solutions to benefit their extensive family, staff, or organization."  I'd have to say that is just how I feel about moving on from my previous job.

      Return to Sender   urlLink PC World New Zealand :   "Using free email services, such as Hotmail and Yahoo Mail, is no longer as easy and fun as it once was... Back in March Yahoo changed its privacy policy to allow it to contact users in all kinds of ways — by email, mail or even phone. It also reset users' 'personal profile' settings by adding and pre-selecting a new set of marketing option boxes. This was done to 'make it easier for you to manage the marketing communications you receive from Yahoo'. Funny, for something that is supposed to be good for me that doesn't sound like any fun at all...   "Unfortunately it's not just Yahoo that has adopted this policy. A growing number of Hotmail's 118 million users worldwide report the same thing. The boxes make it appear people have given permission for Hotmail to share their email address, date of birth and other information with websites run by Microsoft's partners.  I recently told a good friend and Hotmail user about this and he rushed to change his personal settings and preferences — reasoning that if they weren't going to protect his privacy, why should he give away accurate personal information?   "Microsoft also wanted access to a huge database of names — which they have of course — but like my friend earlier, a lot of the names are bogus. I have no doubt they'd prefer a smaller, accurate database of paying clients than a few million billgatessux@hotmail.com fakes."  To change your Personal Profile in  Hotmail , login and navigate to the Options page.  Under the "Your Information" section is the item "Personal Profile".  Click it to change your personal information and uncheck the boxes that say you don't mind sharing your information with Microsoft and its partners.  To change your information in  Yahoo , login and click the link to Mail Options.  Click on the link to Account Information.  I had to re-enter my password and ignore a stupid demographic survey.  I clicked the Edit button next to the Member Information section, changed the information, and clicked to update it.  I then clicked the Edit button for the Contact information section and changed that information. Then I clicked the link to "edit my marketing preferences".  I made sure that every No choice was selected, that the checkboxes to indicate that they are not supposed to contact me via postal mail or by telephone are checked.  Then I finally clicked the Save Changes button.  Whew!

       Huge Wins for the Cincinnati Reds and Dayton Dragons   Both Cincinnati and Dayton have something to be excited about as we head into Independence Week.  Today's  urlLink Dayton Daily News reports  that yesterday the  urlLink Reds  (43-37, or a .5375 winning percentage) came within percentage points of tying the  urlLink St. Louis Cardinals  (42-36, or a .5384 winning percentage) for first place in the National League Central Division.  The Reds, you may recall, were predicted not to amount to much in the preseason.  Yet they have not given up and are part of what hopes to be an exciting pennant race for the second half of the baseball season.  Part, if not most, of the reason the Reds are doing so well may be in the young talent they have raised up from their minor league affiliates.  Why, it was only recently, when Adam Dunn, Austin Kearns, and Juan Encarnacion were playing A-ball for the  urlLink Dayton Dragons  in at Fifth Third Field.  Now look at these guys.   urlLink Adam Dunn was the only Cincinnati Red chosen for the All-Star team .  Austin Kearns  urlLink could be Rookie of the Year .  And what of those  urlLink Dayton Dragons ?  Today's  urlLink Dayton Daily News also reports  that the Dragons, with a 4-3 victory over the Fort Wayne Wizards yesterday, have extended their winning streak to 13 games.  One has to wonder if this is the same team that was in second-to-last place after the first half of the season.  Now, since the beginning of the second half, with a clean slate, the Dragons are hot!  It seems that everything is coming together for the minor league team: pitching, fielding, and hitting.  One player of note is outfielder Chris Williamson.  In his last three games he has produced three homers and 12 RBIs to go with a .415 batting average.  Even with all the great things happening for the team, the players are still forced to keep things in perspective.  As Williamson puts it: "We're not all here about winning championships.  We're here to develop players."  We certainly have witnessed the results in Dunn, Kearns, and Encarnacion.  Keep it up, guys.  I certainly am enjoying it.

       Baring My Soul, Part 4: Children's Naming Rights    urlLink Erica inquires about the names we give our children, why we chose them, and so on.       We have only one child: our daughter Keisha Renee.  No one in our family has that name.  My maternal grandmother's name was Loraine, but we thought - especially after consulting my wife - that Keisha Loraine was not a good idea -  punny , but not the best choice (Ever heard of Quiche Lorraine?).  Actually, the name Keisha Renee just came to me one day.  It sounded beautiful.  Some time after she was born I looked both names up in a baby name book.  "Keisha" is derived from the same African-American word that means "newly created."  "Renee" is French for "reborn."  Hence, we've considered her name an inspiration from God: She was our "newly-created" child, and our desire is for her, when she gets old enough to make the decision to follow God for the rest of her life, that she will be "reborn."  God has not yet allowed us to have any more children, but if we could have a son, we would name him Caleb William.  We like "Caleb" because it means "faithful," after  urlLink the man in the Old Testament with the same name .  William was my father-in-law's name.

       Baring My Soul, Part 3 - Naming Rights    urlLink Erin (air-in) would like to know if I was named after another person and why.   When I was born, apparently my Dad wanted to name me Tyrone Hadley.  Fortunately for me, my mom saw me first, and she chose instead to name me after my Dad.  This turned out to be a great choice because it made him even more proud.  My full name is Daniel Allen Johnson, Jr.  Both my dad and I attended the University of Cincinnati's College of Engineering, and there were actually some times when I got his mail and he got mine.  Since then, I've always made sure to use the "Jr." when I sign my name, etc.

       Baring My Soul, Part 2 - 15 Minutes (Or More) Of Fame    urlLink Dan Johnson (who's that?) asks , "Have you ever been on television or in the newspaper?  More than once?  What for?"     As a child I was on " urlLink The Uncle Al Show ," a local kids television show in Cincinnati.  This past Christmas, Jennie, Keisha, and I were on the local news in Dayton, as part of a story about meeting a Santa Claus who signs for deaf and hard-of-hearing people.  In 1993, I worked for the  urlLink Salvation Army  during their Christmastime Kettle Drive.  Instead of ringing a bell, I played Christmas carols on my alto saxophone.  This greatly cheered up the cashiers at the Kroger where I collected donations.  They especially enjoyed my rendition of "O Holy Night."  The  urlLink Cincinnati Enquirer  did a story about how donations were down, and they contacted the Salvation Army to find someone who demonstrated a lot of Christmas spirit.  The Commander sent the photographer to me.  On Christmas Eve 1993, I was on the front page of the Cincinnati Enquirer!  In 1999 we and another family in Middletown went to  urlLink Middfest , a cross-cultural celebration that takes place each October in Middletown, Ohio, where we lived.  We had a great time, listening to the ethnic music.  My daughter Keisha and our friends' daughter Rachel, both wore overalls that day.  As the music played, I'd pick them up by the back of their overalls and swing them around.  They enjoyed that a lot, and it got the attention of the news photographer.  So, the next day, October 6th, there we all were, on the front page: I swinging both the girls at the same time.

       Baring My Soul, Part 1 - Remembering Important Dates    urlLink Jenny M wonders  if we remember important dates, like birthdays and anniversaries, how we remember, and whether we've ever gotten into trouble for not remembering.  I am inconsistent in remembering important dates, like birthdays and anniversaries.  Sometimes I've used my planner to keep track of these important dates, but when it comes to actually sending cards, etc., I am terrible.  I cannot remember the last Mother's Day, Father's Day, Anniversary, or Birthday card I've mailed.  I am better at making phone calls to people, however.  Yet I can remember those dates for my wife, my daughter, and me.  Note to self: Jennie's birthday is coming up at the end of October.

       The Most ADHD-type Album I've Heard This Year   (subtitled - Should I Start Yet Another Blog?)    BACKGROUND  urlLink From CDD.gov    Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common childhood behavioral disorders and can persist through adolescence and into adulthood. The causes are currently unknown.    What is ADHD?    According to the 2000 American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV-TR), ADHD is a Disruptive Behavior Disorder characterized by on-going inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity occurring in several settings and more frequently and severely than is typical for individuals in the same stage of development. Symptoms begin before age 7 years and can cause serious difficulties in home, school or work life. ADHD can be managed through behavioral or medical interventions, or a combination of the two.    THE MOST ADHD-TYPE ALBUM I'VE HEARD THIS YEAR   With the above, "official" definition in mind, I wanted to share that I finally listened to  urlLink Tim McGraw's recent album "Set This Circus Down,"  and as I read the words to the songs, I was struck by how "ADHD" they sounded.  I don't think that was the original intent, but this is probably a by-product of the recording.  I'm sure many others have listened to it and provided their own reviews, but, since I am ADHD, I feel that I can relate a lot to this album.  It's almost as though it describes my life, or the path, without conscious effort, that my life could take.  Especially the Chorus from the first song,  urlLink "The Cowboy In Me" , which was written by  urlLink Craig Wisemand, Jeffery Steele, and Al Anderson :    The urge to run the restlessness The heart of stone I sometimes get The things I've done for foolish pride The me that's never satisfied The face that's in the mirror when I don't like what I see I guess that's just the cowboy in me     Aha!  So that's what it is!  It makes a little bit of sense, when you think about the original cowboy-types, who risked everything to go west and search for a better life.  A lot of this ADHD behavior was indeed useful back then, right California?  So, we descendents of these cowboys are now ADHD.  Interesting, isn't it?   SHOULD I START YET ANOTHER BLOG?   Which brings me to my other thought.  I already contribute to  urlLink six blogs, five of which I own . (By the way,  urlLink I'm still looking for contributors to Get That Job! )  I can see a potential for a blog related to ADD/ADHD.  I suppose that my interest in separating the   "mind spillage"   is so that those on the " urlLink Journey Inside My Mind " may know that they can take a specific path if they so desire.  If they want to search the  urlLink quotes archive , then go there.  If they want to read some  urlLink creative writing , then by all means, knock yourself out.  Should they desire to  urlLink "Get That Job!" , then go for it.  Care to read some of my  urlLink "Letters to God" ? Don't let me hold you back.  Or, if you're experiencing "Blogger's Block", then check out some  urlLink potential blogging topics .  If you want to  urlLink experience the hodgepodge , then stick around here.  I'm just wondering if I devoted an entire blog to ADHD, would people be interested in it and would I benefit from it.  "I guess that's just the cowboy in me."

       Happy 8/28!   also posted at  urlLink Letters to God  and  urlLink QuotesBlog    Today's date reminds me of one of my all-time favorite verses in the Bible, Romans 8:28 --      urlLink NIV : And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.    urlLink NASB : And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.    urlLink KJV : And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.   urlLink WE : We know that God works out everything for the good of those who love him. They are the people who are part of his plan.   urlLink AMP : We are assured and know that [God being a partner in their labor] all things work together and are [fitting into a plan] for good to and for those who love God and are called according to [His] design and purpose.

       Survey  courtesy of the  urlLink Topics  blog     In no particular order (after the first), the  urlLink five people  who have had the biggest impact on my life are      Jesus Christ , the incarnation of God, who lived a perfect life and  urlLink died for me at just the right time    My lovely and beautiful wife Jennie .  I am still amazed that she loves me, but boy am I glad that she does.  She helps me to see myself more for who I really am, especially when I'm down.  She endures all my eccentricities, and somehow, through the grace of God, is learning to appreciate them.  Through her I see a completely different side of God, and the differences I appreciate and marvel at.  She is my best friend.   My wonderful, darling daughter, Keisha Renee .  Even as I write this, I feel tears welling within me.  A gift from God, she is so much like me in her personality yet fortunately has her mom's good looks.  I am learning so much about patience and gentleness from her, and through my relationship with her I have come to better understand my relationship with God, my Heavenly Father.   My Dad , for whom I was named.  I am so much like him, and I don't even have to try.  I've been realizing this so much more as I've grown up into a husband and father.  In addition to the same name, I have his sense of humor, 'interesting' outlook on life, and eclectic taste in music.  I mentioned this to him one Christmas in a plaque I gave him.  I spent my adolescent years with him, and to this day, he is one of the most important people in my life.   My Mom , who named me after my father.  I've said that I'm a lot like my dad, but I am also much like my mom.  Though most of my life we've lived over 1000 miles from each other, I have felt closer to her than any of my other blood relatives.     urlLink Favorite child, etc. :  I am considered by many in my family to be my mom's favorite.  I was her firstborn, and it has sometimes caused problems in my relationship with some of my other siblings, especially one of my sisters, who is only two years younger than I.   urlLink Mental illness :  I have answered this one before throughout this blog, but I don't mind sharing it again.  In the Fall of 2000 I was diagnosed with depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, and anxiety disorder.  Based on my family's medical history, I also was considered to be at risk for having a manic episode, which is part of bipolar disorder.  I went to therapy and took some medicine, but I never could feel that it was working completely.  At times I felt that I couldn't understand what was going on, what the illness was, etc.  Then,  urlLink this past January,  I started seeing a different psychiatrist who concluded that I was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder and instead showed a lot of signs for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  So I began taking some medicine to help with that.  Currently, I am off the ADD medicine, and I am looking for non-medical methods of dealing with what goes on inside me.  I believe that ADHD is the better diagnosis, based on what I've learned about it.  I am also learning to appreciate it more.  Moreover, I understand better how it relates with the other mental stuff I am dealing with.

       The 'Ooseum'   My wife Jennie started her new job today as a food service worker at the University of Dayton campus.  It's different in that I am still at home with my daughter Keisha, until she goes back to school next week.  Today we went to the Boonshoft Discovery Museum, which my daughter calls "The Ooseum".  So from 10 to 3 today I ran around with her at the museum.  It was a great experience, and both of us had a great time.  After we left and were driving home, I told Keisha that we did a lot today and asked her what she liked the best.  She could not remember it all.  I wasn't surprised.  It's hard for  me  to remember everything we did.  But I related to her some of the exhibits we saw, and I could tell that she really enjoyed the time we spent together.  What makes this even more special is that it's Keisha and I spending the time together this time.  Previously when I was working full time, Jennie and Keisha would do 'fun stuff' like going to the "ooseum".  So, for the past five years of Keisha's life, she and Jennie have gotten very close because of all the time they spent together.  I like the current situation in that Keisha and I are now growing much closer.  She is, after all, in my own unbiased opinion, an awesome kid!

         You are   22%   geek       OK, so maybe you ain't a geek. You do, at least, show a bit of interest in the world around you. Either that, or you have enough of a sense of humor to pick some of the sillier answers on the test. Regardless, you're probably a pretty nifty, well-rounded person who gets along fine with people and can chat with just about anyone without fear of looking stupid or foolish or overly concerned with minutiae.

       I received this via email a long time ago. - DAJ    The intent of this song is that it's GOD who's saying the words.  I hope this can encourage brothers and sisters who need to be reminded that God is always behind us, believing in us, not pointing the finger ready to zap us.    I Believe In You  (C) 1993 Eric Smith  I was with you, from the very start I was close to you, you near to me, always in my heart So many times I counted, your troubles my very own --  I shared your tears; did you realize, you never were alone          Did you hear my voice, when I called?         How I long to hear your laughter         And spend the days with you --          Now and forever after -- hear my voice, hear it true...             I Believe In You  Time ever fleeting, we watched the years pass You always hoping for one better than the last How I longed for you to call me, how I've wanted you so near And I waited so patiently, as you gave into your fears          Do you hear my voice, when I call?         How long to see your spirit soar         And spend the days with you -         Now and forever more -- hear my voice, hear it true...             I Still Believe In You  And then by no mistake, well that day it finally came Like cool refreshing water, I heard you calling on my name And then it seemed like only moments, that we'd ever been apart Now laughing just like children, and dreaming with one heart!          Well you heard my voice when I called         It's so good to hear your laughter         And spend the days with you --       	   Now and forever after -- hear my voice, hear it true --              I Believe In You -- yeah, hear my voice, hear it true --                      I've Always Believed  --   In    --   You.

       "Water Meter Man!"   We just had a visit from Water-Meter Man!  The entire visit lasted a maximum of 30 seconds, but my life is forever changed!!! Seriously, though, I've often wondered what these guys are thinking as they go inside peoples' houses.  My daughter, still in her night clothes, answered the door, but fortunately, did not open it.  Our 5-month old puppy has a coniption fit ("good boy!").  My lovely wife and partner, who is faithfully doing laundry, reminded me that the light above our water meter is out.  So I came upstairs from blogging, and let Water-Meter Man in, amid the loudness of "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" (my hearing-impaired daughter does not have her hearing aids in).  I, bearing flashlight/radio/emergency siren/weather radio, let Water-Meter Man inside (I said that already), explaining to him that our light downstairs where the meter is doesn't work.  So I lead him downstairs, shine the light, he glances at the meter, enters something into his "magical gadget", and heads back upstairs and out the door.  All this in less than one minute.  "Have a nice day," I said, as he left our castle.  I quickly locked our door.  Afterward, I encouraged our daughter for coming to get us after opening the door to reveal "Water-Meter Man", and I taught her to come get us whenever someone else comes to our door.  And "normal" life resumed.  And that's all I have to say about that.

       A Trip To Our Past   I forgot to mention that last week, Jennie and I had to travel to Cincinnati to get copies of our birth certificates.  We got there just in time to get them that day.  As a part-time genealogy buff, it was a good thing.  At $12 per copy, that wasn't so bad.  Perhaps I'll get our relatives' birth certificates sometime in the future.

       A Few Of My Favorite Things    urlLink Erin asks , "What are your favorite things from past decades--a TV show, clothing trend, style of music, etc.? (i.e. rollerskates/four wheelers, Transformers, bell bottoms)"  Somewhere I have a die-cast miniature Millennium Falcon, which I got as a Christmas gift when I was younger.  I know that it probably is a collector's item, but I'd need to find it first.  I also had an almost-complete set of "Empire Strikes Back" story cards.  I remember the anger I felt at the kid down the street, who wouldn't trade me the card I needed for a duplicate one that I had.  I keep a lot of my original writing, which I wrote back in high school and college.  Once I found my "voice", so to speak (no pun intended), I found that I really enjoy writing.  I used to have several LPs: Cheap Trick, KISS, and others.  When I moved out on my own, however, I gave those to my Dad, who has a huge record collection and the record player.

       The Moral of This Story   courtesy of DB via email   "Thursday night me and my youngest daughter stevie made a cake and i told her we would frost it the next day.  well friday was a busy day so i again told her we would try to frost it on saturday (it was covered up to stay fresh) well saturday morning i was having a really hard day emotionally. so i was in my room crying and she comes in there and i told her i was having a hard day and she said very firmly "mom are we going to frost my cake" and i tried to explain to her again that i needed a time out and we would frost the cake later again she said "mom, i want to frost my cake" So the moral of the story is: If you think that your life is bad remember that there might be a child out there that needs a cake frosted.  I hope you enjoy this story."

       What good is a blood donor?    Yesterday I had the privilege to hear a representative from our Community Blood Center here in Dayton, Ohio.  She handed out a flyer with the following text on it:   A blood donor is good for people who go through windshields and red lights.  For  Someone with cancer, hemophilia, or anemia.  Or hepatitis.  Or ulcers.   For  people being operated on.   For  people into feudin' and fightin'.    For  people who are almost out of life because they are almost out of blood.   For  a little girl who doesn't know that leukemia has happened to her.  Or why.   For  a little boy who needs something revved up that wound down.  Like energy.   For  people having open-heart surgery.   For  people who need a blood donor and also an organ donor -- a part as well as a pint -- a new heart or new liver, a lung or a kidney.   For  new babies needing new blood.  Or new mothers needing a transfusion.   For  little kids who get into something poison or fall onto something sharp.   For  people who fool around with something that explodes, goes off, bites or shatters.   For  people burned pretty bad.   For  daredevils.  Tree climbers.   For  people at the wrong place at the wrong time.  A blood donor is good for people who are in a lot worse shape than most people you know.  Someone needs a lot of your blood a lot.  ---------- What are  your  reasons for not being a regular blood donor?  I will be eligible to donate again the first or second week in October.

Reduce your interest rate   "A study by the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) shows how easy it is to reduce the interest rate on your credit cards just by picking up the phone.

Publish it yourself   "Clark’s received many calls from people who are interested in getting their first book published. What’s happening is the big publishing houses are only publishing a very small handful of authors and they’re even turning away some of the veteran authors who are considered 'mid-list.'

       urlLink  Streams of Consciousness    A few days ago, I  urlLink reflected on my blogging experience over the past seven months.   I wrote, "The links to writing posts, etc., are getting dusty, and I am considering creating another blog for just my own creative writing and moving the creative writing posts from this blog to the new one."  Well, I am proud to announce the birth of yet another blog, which I've entitled " urlLink Streams of Consciousness ."  In high school I learned about one style of writing called Stream of Consciousness, in which the author writes as he or she thinks.  Perhaps it makes sense; perhaps it doesn't.  Since this blog you're currently reading is a " urlLink Journey Inside My Mind ", I thought, why not make my creative writing blog a trip through the " urlLink Streams of Consciousness ?"  In other words, it's sort of a specific path along the journey, if you know what I mean.  Anyhow, I have begun removing some of the creative writing posts from this blog to the new one, so the links to writing posts at the left may or may not be valid yet.  If you come across any broken links, please let me know.  Thanks and keep blogging!

       Reflections on the Blogging Experience, So Far   I am forming an opinion about blogging, based on my experience with it so far.  Maybe your comments will help me.  Now, I cannot guarantee that anything I type henceforth in this post will be grammatically correct or will even make any sense at all.  Get ready for some stream-of-consciousness:  It seems that those blogs centered around a particular theme get more traffic.  I am talking about those blogs that are about technology, cooking,  urlLink help with blogger's block , creative writing,  urlLink quotations ,  urlLink job hunting , and so on.  Someone who wants to read about technology has a better chance of finding something in a blog that is more techology-based, for example.  Yet I also find it useful to read blogs that tend to be of a more personal nature.  For example, I may never get to meet  urlLink Mike Zellers  in person (although I'd like to, someday), but I can discern a lot about him from reading his blog.  I recently created a weblog about the job hunting process, called "Get That Job!".  I have set it up so that other people can contribute content.  Actually, I am eager for others to sign up as regular contributors or occasional contributors. So let me know if you are interested!  The links to writing posts, etc., are getting dusty, and I am considering creating another blog for just my own creative writing and moving the creative writing posts from this blog to the new one.  What do you think?

But this isn't true. Men speak about sex and relationships all the time. It's just in code..."  urlLink more>>

       The Topics Blog    urlLink Melanie asks , "What do you hope to accomplish for yourself over the next 5 years? Or do you not think that far into the future?"  I have a hard time thinking that far into the future.  Heck, I have a hard time thinking about what's going on tomorrow.

       On Transitions    urlLink In Mike Zellers's summary of his experiences from this past year , he says "I am and have been a very lucky person. How many go from being laid off to their dream job (although a suprising number of people i've talked to have found being laid off as a blessing in disguise)? Overall, the net change in my life has clearly been positive over this time frame..."  Aptly put.  My thoughts exactly.  I personally found the separation from my company as a blessing in disguise.  I was burned-out from a long drive and much time away from my family.  Since that time, I've focused my job search closer to home, and I've spent a whole lot more time with my family.  Not to mention, I don't feel as uptight - relieved is more like it.

       Degrees of Blog Separation    urlLink Bene Diction  comments on  urlLink BloggedyBlog's Degree of blog separation idea .   I've heard of something like this called  urlLink SnobJumping .  Those of us members of  urlLink BlogSnob  get a random link to someone else's blog on their blog.    So, for example, I can click the link to that random blog, and it is also supposed to have a  urlLink BlogSnob  blog link on it.  The idea is to continue as far as you can.  I have never been able to link all the way back to myself.  Most of the time, I get caught in a dead-end; someone has removed the  urlLink BlogSnob  link, and I have to start over at my blog.  I may try the different approach.

       3 H's: Hazy, Hot, Humid - The Saga Continues... Ozone Action Day   That's right campers.  Conditions in the Miami Valley are once again favorable for the creation of ground-level ozone, otherwise known as smog.  So gentle readers, leave those lawn mowers off until evening, get by on those remaining fumes of gas in your tank until 6 pm tonight, and, of course...    Do Not Go Outside!!!!!     OK.  Maybe that was a little cheeky.  Nevertheless, it's gonna be another scorcher.  Not like Afghanistan, however.  My friend Scott is currently stationed over there, and he reports a cool 130 degrees.  Heck, when he comes back to Dayton, he may want to wear long pants and a jacket! (maybe not)

       When Should Your Child Stay Home?    The nurses at Keisha's preschool gave us this information at the Open House.  Some of it is self-explanatory, but some of it might not be.    If your child has any of the following symptoms he/she should be kept at home and the teacher notified of the reason for the absence.   Fever Vomiting Diarrhea (one or more loose stools in a 24-hour period) Unexplained rash Red, watery or draining eyes Open sores, especially around the nose or mouth Bugs or eggs in the hair Earache or ear drainage Yellow or green drainage from the nose More than an occasional cough Wheezing/difficulty breathing Unable to eat or drink a regular diet   If your child is not interested in playing and eating and wants to lie down, he/she should be watched and the child's temperature checked.  Do not send the child to school if you give a fever-reducing medicine such as Tylenol.   Question for you, gentle reader: what is it about the symptoms above that makes them important enough to warrant keeping a child home from school?

       Stay-at-Home Dad   Since Jennie has been working during the day for the past four weeks and recently picked up another job in the evenings, I've become somewhat of a stay-at-home Dad.  It's different in a good way.  I get to take Keisha to her weekly speech therapy appointments.  We get to hang out together and do fun stuff like go to the library, stop by the UDF (United Dairy Farmers) near the  urlLink University of Dayton  for a soda.  We did all three yesterday (Friday).  At 8:30 AM we dropped Jennie off  urlLink at work  and then stopped by the  urlLink UDF on Brown Street  because we were thirsty.  We noticed that they had 3 Krispy Kreme donuts for $1.79, so we bought some.  After we sat down, Keisha and I began eating our donuts, and I brought out my Bible and told Keisha that we were going to read something from it together.  I found the  urlLink Parable of the Lost Sheep .  Then we did our memory verse from this past Tuesday night's Family Devotional,  urlLink Psalm 37:4 .  After this we drove to the clinic to see if my medicine was available for me to pick up.  No dice.  Then we drove to  urlLink Children's Medical Center , where Keisha has her speech therapy.  She did really well - picking up a lot of vocabulary.  Then we drove to the  urlLink Dayton and Montgomery County Public Library  to check out some videos and some CDs.  We also got some books for Keisha to read.  They have an entire shelf in the Children's book area devoted to new readers.  Cool!  We checked out  urlLink Raffi 's  urlLink Singable Songs Collection , which we all love!  She's actually been listening to Raffi since she was a couple months old and I'd sing her the songs from the  urlLink Singable Songs for the Very Young  album.     urlLink       &nbsp;    The Singable Songs Collection   20th Anniversary Special Edition 3 Albums: Singable Songs for the Very Young, More Singable Songs for the Very Young and Corner Grocery Store    1996   &nbsp;      urlLink      Singable Songs for the Very Young 1976

        urlLink MSNBC | Weblog Central - Blogspotting    From the  urlLink September 26, 2002 2:40 ET post :  Once upon a time, before the Internet revolutionized public discourse, there was only one sure way for a person to become a pundit: get a job as a journalist and hold forth from the pages of a newspaper, magazine or a broadcast organization.          But now, with the explosion of personal online journals known as Weblogs, anyone with something to say and access to the right software can be a publisher, a pundit and observer of events great and small.          Weblogs — personal online journals, saturated with attitude and rich with links to Internet resources — have transformed and democratized the media landscape. What had once quietly flourished in the grassroots of cyberspace has now burst into the mainstream, transforming the way Internet news and communities are perceived.          That’s why MSNBC is launching Weblog Central, your gateway to the world of personal news.         This page will serve as a perch from which you can observe and participate in the brave new world of personal news. We hope you’ll make it a daily destination.

       Diets & Dying   from email (so it   must   be true, right?)     The Japanese eat very little fat and suffer fewer heart attacks than the British or Americans.  The French eat a lot of fat and also suffer fewer heart attacks than the British or Americans.  The Japanese drink very little red wine and suffer fewer heart attacks than the British or Americans.  The Italians drink excessive amounts of red wine and also suffer fewer heart attacks than the British or Americans.  The Germans drink a lot of beers and eat lots of sausages and fats and suffer fewer heart attacks than the British or Americans.     CONCLUSION:    Eat and drink what you like.  Speaking English is apparently what kills you.

       On Romance and Such   I found this among my other writings.   There once was a young schoolboy who was instructed to write an essay about Benjamin Franklin.  He didn't know much about the life of the early patriot, but did know the essential details.  He squirmed around on his chair for a little bit, chewed on his pencil, and then wrote    Benjamin Franklin was born in Boston, but he soon got tire of that and moved to Philadelphia.  When he got to Philadelphia he was hungry so he bought a loaf of bread.  He put the bread under his arm and walked up the street.  He passed a woman.  The woman smiled at him.  He married the woman and then discovered electricity.      "The Romance of Christmas",  Creative Help for Daily Living , Nov/Dec 1983, Norman Vincent Peale, p. 22

       Guidepost?  What's That?   On some blogs with the ability for readers to add comments, you see something perhaps a bit more intuitive, like the  word  'Comments'.  Not so with this blog, as you might already be aware.  Here they are called 'guideposts'.  I have provided a dictionary definition below for your benefit.   Guidepost n. 1. A post with a sign giving directions for travelers, usually placed at a crossroad. 2. Something that serves as a guide or an example; a guideline.   So, as you take this 'Journey Inside My Mind,'  feel free to add any thoughts/advice/critcisms/wittisms/tips (aka 'guideposts') you have. Way easier than scrawling on the monitor...

       The Most ADHD-type Album I've Heard This Year - Feedback   A friend of mine, MN, a teacher in California who is expecting her first child, replied to an email I sent about the  urlLink Most ADHD Album I've Heard .  She writes:    Clever connection to California. I have mixed feelings about the whole ADHD thing.  First of all, pregnant women in the 8th - 9th month should continue to eat lots of veggies, when their child's brains are developing.    Secondly,  ADHD & ADD are often used as excuses by parents to not offer their children a structured life including discipline & feeling the consequences of their behaviour.  So, quite frankly, from a teacher's perspective, I am skeptical of most people who label their kids with either one.   Yes, their is a grain of reality in the "disorder."  :)

       Many, Many Reasons To Blog   There are so many reasons for people to blog, that is, to keep a weblog or webjournal.  I plan to make this posting category a recurrent one, or continue editing it until I'm satisfied with the list.  The idea is to present a reason followed by link/s to at least one blog as an example.  In either case, you'll want to stay tuned.  Also, if you have any ideas you'd like to contribute, then include them in your comments.  1.   urlLink SuperSonics : A place for teachers to add and students to check homework assignments for the day.  2.   urlLink Streams of Consciousness ,  urlLink Topics ,  urlLink 600 Seconds ,  urlLink WriteThis :  An outlet for creative writing.  3.  "Blogging can be edifying and gratifying.  It [elicits] deeper thought from us than we would have before by introducing us to people with deeper thoughts, if only in areas we don't think much about.  It encourages thought and reflection.  Blogging adds to the quality of my life.  That's why I do it." --  urlLink Chase   4.   urlLink Bene Diction's answer :   I blog to help other bloggers. I blog to relax and just be myself. Being a professional writer had/has major drawbacks along with the benefits.  Blogging makes different demands on me than broadcasting.  I blog for fun. I blog to give a hand up to others learning to write and think better. I blog to bridge worlds.  Blogging isn't a complicated thing for me. Less angst than professional work. Blog on!   5.  urlLink Yet some more reasons to blog.

       Legendary Photo    Folks with heart conditions, please disregard.  Thanks.   This is pretty neat. Apparently the owners of this house had been seeing images and hearing voices for quite a while. They did some research and found out that a lady who lost her husband during the civil war once lived in the house.  Legend says that she used to sit at the table and look across the fields in anticipation of her loved one returning home. He never came. So, they say she still waits.   They caught  urlLink this photo  of what they claim to be her.  This one was wild and a little spooky once you find the ghost in the picture. It took me a few seconds to find it, but when you do it just stands out. Like one of those optical illusions.  To save you some time, concentrate around the table. Best not to focus too much on one spot. Look around the table and toward the window. Best to enlarge.  For an added touch turn up the volume, it's faint but you can hear the ghost talking sometimes in a low murmur.  Just stare on  urlLink that picture , and she will show up....

Here's an excerpt:    It seems every week brings news of executives tricking and treating themselves to gobs of money while shareholders watch their goody bags dry up. As a result, many people will have less money to spend this winter on holiday gifts and Thanksgiving feasts.   But let's not allow them to ruin Halloween. If nothing else, the corporate and political scandals segway right into a holiday that celebrates gluttony and greed. So this year, forget about dressing little Johnny as a wolfman or little Suzie as a witch, and try something in keeping with the times.    For some other Halloween ideas, please check out  urlLink John Ludwig's Halloween blog .

       Humor | Playing Golf   A married man was having an affair with his secretary. One day, their passions overcame them and they took off for her house. Exhausted from the afternoon's activities, they fell asleep and awoke at around 8 p.m.     As the man threw on his clothes, he told the woman to take his shoes outside and rub them through the grass and dirt. Mystified, she nonetheless complied and he slipped into his shoes and drove home.  "Where have you been?" demanded his wife when he entered the house.   "Darling," replied the man, "I can't lie to you. I've been having an affair with my secretary.  I fell asleep in her bed and didn't wake up until eight o'clock."   The wife glanced down at his shoes and said, "You liar! You've been playing golf!"

       Foul Mouth  or  A Pain in the Neck   Since last Thursday, my mouth has been so sore.  I think I may have scraped too hard against my gum with my toothbrush.  Anyhow, it's in the lower part of the right side of my jaw, very close to where the wisdom tooth used to be.  The pain extends from where the lymph node is in my neck all the way up to my right ear so that it feels like I have a slight earache.  So, I have a pain in my neck.  Literally.  Since the end of July I haven't had any insurance, so I've been reluctant to go see someone because I'm also unable to pay for it right now.  It is presently 11:46 PM on Sunday, October 6, 2002, and the only place that would be able to see me right now is the hospital emergency room.  So I'm going to see if I can withstand this for a little while longer before I break down and head to the ER.  I'm not that willing to incur the exorbitant medical bills.

       Dirty Jobs   On arriving back home this morning after dropping Jennie off at work and Keisha off at school, I found out that the puppy has diarrhea.  Fortunately, he was confined to his cage.  I vomited three times trying to get the cage outside to clean it.  Thank God for dish soap, bleach, the garden hose, and the sewer located so close to our driveway.  Poor puppy.  After I had cleaned his cage, I gave him a bath - outside, of course.  Then, since I had to run an errand, I put him out in the back yard under the shade with a fresh bowl of water and just a little bit of food.

The way it works is that each day I write 100 words - typos and all - and submit them to the site.    Good news!  Last month's entries are now available for you to view.  Almost all of the time, the entries are random, with no connected meaning to each other.  However, toward the end of last month, I started a little bit of a story line.

I found the link to the article on the front page of today's  urlLink MSN.com , and when I clicked it, I noticed that some freebies were available.  Recalling from five years ago, freebies for a newborn and the newborn's parents, freebies are still great.  Not only do you have the article about the top baby names from 1880-2001, but you can sign up for some free newsletters, including one called "Baby's Ages and Stages," which I thought many soon-to-be or new parents would love.  So check it out, and if you find anything interesting, let me know.  We're still working on baby #2.

These are transforming achievements. Previous Office upgrades have been yawners, but version 11 should rivet the attention of IT planners.

What time do you wake up in the morning?  About a half hour after the alarm clock rings or when  urlLink my wife  wakes me up (usually about 6:30am).

       Journey Inside My Mind: Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder   One of the main reasons I started this weblog was to be able to document the so-called "journey inside my mind".  I tend to be rather neurotic, and I've often not been able to understand why my world seems to be in a whirlwind and out of control.  Since undergoing therapy, I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder (aka manic depression), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).  Throughout a lot of this journey, I've tried to learn as much about the mental illnesses as possible to see how and where I fit in.  The idea is to glean from others' knowledge so that I can get well.  I'm currently being seen by a psychiatrist and a counselor, and the diagnosis is what the doc referred to as "process OCD", which I'm understanding as Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD).  It is true that I have some of the "content OCD" symptoms: I pick at scabs, touch my face or hands excessively, etc.  But the big thing is that my "process" of doing things is so rigid.  So I'm journeying to discover more about this OCPD, and, thanks to the folks at Yahoo!, I was able to find a  urlLink web site that defines OCPD .  I link to it here more for my benefit, but if you also benefit, then that's a bonus.

       Veteran's Day   from email (thanks to Jeff I.)    What is a Vet?    He is the cop on the beat who spent six months in Saudi Arabia sweating two gallons a day making sure the armored personnel carriers didn't run out of fuel. He is the barroom loudmouth, dumber than five wooden planks, whose overgrown frat-boy behavior is outweighed a hundred times in the cosmic scales by four hours of exquisite bravery near the 38th parallel. She (or he) is the nurse who fought against futility and went to sleep sobbing every night for two solid years in Da Nang. He is the POW who went away one person and came back another - or didn't come back AT ALL. He is the Parris Island drill instructor who has never seen combat - but has saved countless lives by turning slouchy, no-account rednecks and gang members into Marines, and teaching them to watch each other's backs. He is the parade-riding Legionnaire who pins on his ribbons and medals with a prosthetic hand. He is the career quartermaster who watches the ribbons and medals pass him by. He is the three anonymous heroes in The Tomb Of The Unknowns, whose presence at the Arlington National Cemetery must forever preserve the memory of all anonymous heroes whose valor dies unrecognized with them on the battlefield or in the ocean's sunless deep. He is the old guy bagging groceries at the supermarket - palsied now and aggravatingly slow - who helped liberate a Nazi death camp and who wishes all day long that his wife were still alive to hold him when the nightmares come. He is an ordinary and yet an extraordinary human being - a person who offered some of his life's most vital years in the service of his country, and who sacrificed his ambitions so others would not have to sacrifice theirs. He is a soldier and a savior and a sword against the darkness, and he is nothing more than the finest, greatest testimony on behalf of the finest, greatest nation ever known.  So remember, each time you see someone who has served our country, just lean over and say Thank You. That's all most people need, and in most cases it will mean more than any medals they could have been awarded or were awarded.   Two little words that mean a lot: "THANK YOU."  It's the soldier, not the reporter, who gave us our freedom of the press.  It's the soldier, not the poet, who gave us our freedom of speech.  It's the soldier, not the campus organizer, who gave us our freedom to demonstrate.  It's the soldier, who salutes the flag, who serves others with respect for the flag, and whose coffin is draped by the flag, who allows the protester to burn the flag.    Prayer for our Servicemen   Lord, hold our troops in Your loving hands.  Protect them as they protect us.   Bless them and their families for the selfless acts they perform for us in our time of need.  I ask this in the name of Jesus, our Lord and Savior.  Amen.  When you've read this, please stop for a moment and say a prayer for our service men and women stationed all over the world.  There is nothing attached...Of all the gifts you could give a U. S. serviceman, prayer is the very best one.

       TWO FROGS   A group of frogs were traveling through the woods, and two of them fell into a deep pit. All the other frogs gathered around the pit. When they saw how deep the pit was, they told the unfortunate frogs they would never get out.   The two frogs ignored the comments and tried to jump up out of the pit.  The other frogs kept telling them to stop, that they were as good as dead. Finally, one of the frogs took heed to what the other frogs were saying and simply gave up. He fell down and died.  The other frog continued to jump as hard as he could. Once again, the crowd of frogs yelled at him to stop the pain and suffering and just die. He jumped even harder, and finally, he made it out.  When he got out, the other frogs asked him, "Why did you continue jumping? Didn't you hear us?" The frog explained to them that he was deaf. He thought they were encouraging him the entire time.  This story teaches two lessons:  There is power of life and death in the tongue. An encouraging word to someone who is down can lift them up and help them make it through the day. A destructive word to someone who is down can be what it takes to kill them. Be careful of what you say. Speak life to those who cross your path.   The power of words ... it is sometimes hard to understand that an encouraging word can go such a long way. Anyone can speak words that tend to rob another of the spirit to continue in difficult times.  Special is the individual who will take the time to encourage another.  That's what I'm doing here.  Cheers!

What do you want?"   "I'm calling to report my neighbor Adrian Thibodeaux! He is hiding marijuana inside his firewood."   "Thank you very much for the call, sir."   The next day, the FBI agents descend on Thibodeaux's house. They search the shed where the firewood is kept. Using axes, they bust open every piece of wood, but find no marijuana. They swear at Thibodeaux and leave.   The phone rings at Thibodeaux's house.   "Hey, Adrian! Did the FBI come?"   "Yeah!"   "Did they chop your firewood?"   "Yep."   "Great, call the FBI back and tell them that there is cocaine in my garden.  It needs to be plowed."

       Remembering High School   I received word recently that the mother of one of my close classmates from high school had passed away.  It prompted me to spend some time last night looking through my high school yearbook.  I saw a lot of people that are fresh in my memory, but then there were a lot of people whom I used to know, but now I barely remember them.  It was a little emotional, seeing the faces of everyone again.  I remember the kind of person I was back then.  I'm glad I've grown up somewhat.  Wow.  Has it really been almost 15 years?

        urlLink So, She Didn't Have Cancer!    Is it just me, or is the Miami Valley getting a lot more national news coverage lately?   Urbana, Ohio - Police say a mother tried to trick her daughter and the rest of the community into believing that her daughter had leukemia, even to the point of shaving her child's head, giving her sleeping pills, and putting her into counseling to prepare to die.  Members of the community had donated money.  The child has now been taken from her mother and placed into custody with other relatives.   This situation reminds me of what happened in  urlLink "The Sixth Sense" .  The one mother always added PineSol or other household cleaner to her daughter's soup.

       Believe me, your blog will seem more interesting   From reading the comments, some of which are my own, I feel that there is a competition going for who can have the lamest post, " urlLink the dullest blog ", or anyone else who comes to visit it.  It also reminds me of a bit I've heard on the Bob and Tom Morning Show called "Mr. Obvious".  I was sitting in my chair when all of a sudden, I felt an itch.  I realized it was on my leg.  When I scratched it, I felt better. I felt hungry.  I looked at the time and discovered that it was time for lunch.  I went to get something to eat.  I gave the man at the drive-thru some money, and he gave me food in return.  I ate the food and was happy. I heard this ringing sound in my ears, and I looked over to the telephone.  I picked it up and it stopped ringing.  I said 'hello'.  I heard a voice on the other side.  When I was finished talking I hung up the phone.

       Obnoxious Automobile Ads on the Radio Rant   I find it so easy to get irritated by those obnoxious ads I hear on the radio from car dealers.  In their desperation to get someone... anyone... to show up at their dealership... they resort to YELLING!  LOUD MUSIC!  OBNOXIOUS SOUND EFFECTS - LIKE A HAMMER, LIKE EXPLOSIONS -- I SURE FEEL LIKE GOING TO THEIR DEALERSHIP BUT NOT FOR LOOKING AT A CAR!  RATHER, TO BEAT THE SNOT OUT OF THE PEOPLE WHO PRODUCE AND STAR IN THOSE ADS!!  AAAAAAAGGGHHH!  A snippet of some I've heard over the past year... "A BIKE FOR CHRIS --- PAID FOR!!!  A DOLLY FOR SUSIE --- PAID FOR!!!  THAT NEW DIAMOND RING --- PAID FOR!!! (loud music begins, some explosions) GET A MINIMUM OF $2000 FOR ANY TRADE...  ANY TRADE!!!  ANY TRADE!!!!!"  "THAT'S RIGHT... PUSH IT IN... PULL IT IN...  DRAG IT IN!!!! "  Oh yeah, there was that miserable spoof of the "12 Days of Christmas" in which they sang about all the people who were approved for a new car loan: "... TWO FIRST-TIME BUYERS, AND A MAN WITH A BANCRUPTCY!!!"  A few years ago I heard the following:  "PLANET FORD WILL TAKE OVER YOUR PAYMENTS!"  Now I know they said payments because I heard the ad over and over and over again, but the first few times I thought they were saying a certain part of a man's anatomy.  Combine  THAT  with "PUSH IT IN... PULL IT IN..." and we're about ready to call the FCC.  Okay, enough.  I feel better now that I got that off my chest.

For example, if your goal is 'I want to organize my home,' you can't specifically measure how organized your home has become, although you may sense that things are easier to find. Writing some specific, smaller steps that move you toward your larger goals can help you track where you are in pursuing that goal. For organizing your home, for example, you can set up steps such as the following:..."  urlLink read more...

       From  urlLink Top Stories from U.S. News & World Report | The Melancholy Body    Increasingly, it appears that what we call depression is not strictly psychological but is, instead, a condition that occupies the whole body. "Depression is really the only systemic disease that affects--and complicates--almost all other diseases," says Philip Gold, the chief of clinical neuroendocrinology at the National Institute of Mental Health. In fact, depression not only affects and complicates existing disorders like diabetes, heart disease, cancer, even osteoporosis; it might also trigger them.

Usually, buffer underrun results from poor CD recording software, a slow computer, or a CD-R drive with insufficient buffer memory.  Now, let's see you use this new word as you go about your day.  If you dare to go beyond this word, then check out  urlLink The Complete CNET Tech Glossary .  This site is especially good if all your Net-savvy friends laugh at you every time you open your mouth.

       Remembering the Wright Brothers   The  urlLink Dayton Daily News reported yesterday  that "Federal officials and Air Force generals helped Dayton celebrate its aviation heritage today by dedicating a new National Park Service interpretive center close to where the Wright brothers learned to fly almost a century ago.  The interpretive center dedication took place on the 99th anniversary of the Wright brothers' first powered flights and coincided with the Wright family's annual wreath-laying ceremony at the Wright Brothers Memorial in a hilltop park that overlooks the flying field...

       A Santa Claus Story    from my friend Laura H. from high school :  I remember my first Christmas party with Grandma.  I was just a kid.  I remember tearing across town on my bike to visit her on the day my big sister dropped the bomb: "There is no Santa Claus," she jeered.  "Even dummies know that!"  My grandma was not the gushy kind, never had been.  I fled to her that day because I knew she would be straight with me.  I knew Grandma always told the truth, and I knew that the truth always went down a whole lot easier when swallowed with one of her world-famous cinnamon buns.  Grandma was home, and the buns were still warm.  Between bites I told her everything.  She was ready for me.  "No Santa Claus?" she snorted.  "Ridiculous!  Don't believe it.  That rumor has been going around for years, and it makes me mad, plain mad.  Now, put on your coat, and let's go."  "Go?  Go where, Grandma?" I asked.  I hadn't even finished my second cinnamon bun.    "Where" turned out to be Kerby's General Store, the one store in town that had a little bit of just about everything.  As we walked through its doors, Grandma handed me ten dollars.  That was a bundle in those days.  "Take this money and buy something for someone who needs it.  I'll wait for you in the car."  Then she turned and walked out of Kerby's.  I was only eight years old.  I'd often gone shopping with my mother, but never had I shopped for anything all by myself.  The store seemed big and crowded, full of people scrambling to finish their Christmas shopping.  For a few moments I just stood there, confused, clutching that ten-dollar bill, wondering what to buy, and who on earth to buy it for.  I thought of everybody I knew:  my family, my friends, my neighbors, the kids at school, the people who went to my church.  I was just about thought out, when I suddenly thought of Bobbie Decker.  He was a kid with bad breath and messy hair, and he sat right behind me in Mrs. Pollock's grade-two class.  Bobbie Decker didn't have a coat.  I knew that because he never went out for recess during the winter.  His mother always wrote a note, telling the teacher that he had a cough, but all we kids knew that Bobbie Decker didn't have a cough, and he didn't have a coat.  I fingered the ten-dollar bill with growing excitement.  I would buy Bobbie Decker a coat.  I settled on a red corduroy one that had a hood to it.  It looked real warm and he would like that.  "Is this a Christmas present for someone?" the lady behind the counter asked kindly, as I laid my ten dollars down.    "Yes," I replied shyly.  "It's for Bobbie."  The nice lady smiled at me.  I didn't get any change, but she put the coat in a bag and wished me a Merry Christmas.  That evening, Grandma helped me wrap the coat in Christmas paper and ribbons, and write, "To Bobbie, From Santa Claus" on it.  Grandma said that Santa always insisted on secrecy.  Then she drove me over to Bobbie Decker's house, explaining as we went that I was now and forever officially one of Santa's helpers.  Grandma parked down the street from Bobbie's house, and she and I crept noiselessly and hid in the bushes by his front walk.  Then Grandma gave me a nudge.  "All right, Santa Claus," she whispered, "get going."  I took a deep breath, dashed for his front door, threw the present down on his step, pounded his doorbell and few back to the safety of the bushes and Grandma.  Together we waited breathlessly in the darkness for the front door to open.  Finally it did, and there stood Bobbie.  Forty years haven't dimmed the thrill of those moments spent shivering, beside my grandma, in Bobbie Decker's bushes.  That night, I realized that those awful rumors about Santa Claus were just what Grandma said they were: ridiculous.  Santa was alive and well, and we were on his team.

Frankly, I'd rather watch a repeat of CBS's CSI before I'd watch 'Dinotopia'.  What a waste!  I never liked the mini-series, and I could not understand why they decided to make it a regular series.  I guess it's back to the drawing board.

       Humor | Pearly Gates   again, from Jeff I.'s email   A man appears before the pearly gates. "Have you ever done anything of particular merit?" St. Peter asks.  "Well, I can think of one thing," the man offers. "Once I came upon a gang of high-testosterone bikers who were threatening a young woman. I directed them to leave her alone, but they wouldn't listen. So I approached the largest and most heavily tattooed biker. I smacked him on the head, kicked his bike over, ripped out his nose ring and threw it on the ground, and told him, 'Leave her alone now or you'll answer to me.'"  St. Peter was impressed. "When did this happen?"  "A couple of minutes ago."

       Humor | Family Car   from Jeff I.'s email   A young boy had just gotten his driving permit. He asked his father, who was a minister, if they could discuss his use of the family car.  His father took him into his study and said, "I'll make a deal with you.  You bring your grades up, study the Bible a little, get your hair cut and then we'll talk about it."  After about a month, the boy came back and again asked his father if they could discuss his use of the car.  They again went into the father's study where the father said, "Son, I've been very proud of you. You have brought your grades up, you've studied the Bible diligently, but you didn't get your hair cut.  The young man waited a moment and then replied, "You know Dad, I've been thinking about the fact that Samson had long hair, Moses had long hair, Noah had long hair, and Jesus had long hair.  His Father said, "Yes, and everywhere they went, they walked.

       Burningbird and the Chamber of Secrets?   Over the weekend Jennie and I saw  urlLink Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets .  When I took a look at the post at  urlLink Burningbird: Practical RDF Book Cover .  Maybe it's because the movie is still fresh in my mind, but when I saw the name of the site, I thought of a Phoenix, namely the one named Fawkes, who was in the movie.  The picture on the O'Reilly book cover resembles the Phoenix from Harry Potter.  In one scene of the movie, the Phoenix dies and burns itself up.  Then it regenerates itself from the ashes.  It also did a number on the big snake during the climactic scene in the Chamber of Secrets, tearing its eyes out, rendering it blind.  Could this be more than a coincidence?  P.S.  I KNEW I'd seen that face before!!!  Jason Isaacs, the actor who portrays Lucius Malfoy, Draco's father, played Colonel William Tavington in  urlLink The Patriot .

       Keeping Christ in Christmas   Christmas.  A time filled with traditions and symbols, found in decorations, singing of carols, gift-giving, and so forth.  It can seem challenging to keep the "Christ" in Christmas, but a look at the history of Christmas and the symbolism can help us to keep the proper perspective.  Have your ever wondered about the "12 Days of Christmas"?  That carol, with the partridge in a pear tree, two turtledoves... well, I won't labor you with the entire list, but hopefully you remember.  Anyhow... the  urlLink Catholic Information Network  describes the carol as "An Underground Catechism".  Also, more comprehensive sites delve into the  urlLink Symbols, Customs, and Traditions of Christmas .  At that site there is even a link to take the Christmas Quiz to find out how much you learned.  Finally, someone has prepared a  urlLink Christmas Symbols Unit Study  that can not only be used to instruct children but anyone who is interested in the symbolism of Christmas.  Whether the intent of the various symbols was to point back to the true meaning or not, we are not without reason to keep Christ in Christmas.   Update :   urlLink Jen has some ideas on the True Meaning of Christmas .  I couldn't find a permalink, so you'll have to find it yourself.  It's her 12/18/2002 11:06 AM post.

Finally, she looked up at him.  "How did it happen, Tim?"  "It was terrible, Brenda.  He fell into a vat of Guiness Stout and drowned."  "Oh my Dear Jesus!  But you must tell me true, Tim.  Did he at least go quickly?"  "Well, no Brenda... no."  "No?"  "No.  Fact is, he got out three times to pee."

       Dayton Ranked as a Dangerous City    urlLink MSNBC reported on December 10, 2002 , that a recent study ranked Dayton, Ohio one of the most dangerous cities in the US.  According to the report, the study was done by a Kansas Publisher, and it based the rankings on FBI statistics about the number of murders, rapes, robberies, assaults, burglaries, and automobile thefts.   urlLink On December 9, 2002, the Dayton Daily News reported  that Dayton was ranked 15th in the nation; St. Louis was first, outranking Detroit.  Atlanta, Georgia was third, followed by Gary, Indiana and Baltimore, Maryland.  The safest cities?  According to the report, they are Amherst, New York; followed by Brick Township, New Jersey, Newton, Massachusetts, and the California communities of Thousand Oaks and Sunnyvale.   urlLink On December 11th, the Dayton Daily News reported  that "at least 30 cities with populations of at least 75,000, including Akron and Canton, weren't included on the list because the police departments there didn't submit complete statistics to the FBI."  Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco were also missing from the list.  I agree with Tim Apolito, a University of Dayton instructor who teaches courses on criminal justice and U.S. policing: "When you look at any statistic you have to look at what that statistic really means."  Statistics alone don't tell the entire story.

       Aside | My Special Girl     urlLink Our five-year old daughter Keisha  is hearing-impaired and has to wear hearing aids.     Seeing those words I just typed cuts my heart still.  It's been almost two years since we found out that she had hearing loss.  It was determined that her cochleas, the spiral-shaped part of the inner ear, were never fully developed.  I bring this up because within the last couple of days we've been reminded of it, and, while we've grown to accept it, it still hurts in our hearts.  We realize even more how fragile we human beings are, and how much more we need God.  This past Sunday we spent some time with some friends from church.  They have two daughters: one who is eight and one who is eleven months.  Rachel, the eight year old, asked me, "When is Keisha not going to have to wear her hearing aids anymore?"    I replied, "Never.  She will most probably always have to wear hearing aids for the rest of her life."  The finality of that statement struck an emotional chord that hadn't been touched in awhile.  Then, yesterday evening, as my wife was tucking Keisha into her bed, she observed something else.  Keisha has to take her hearing aids off before she goes to sleep, and as Jennie was tucking her in, Keisha brought out a stuffed bear.  This bear, when you squeeze its hand, sings "Jesus Loves Me" and says the "Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep" prayer.  She received it from her aunt a couple years ago.  Keisha squeezed the bear, and it started playing "Jesus Loves Me".  Jennie, my wife, noticed that Keisha had put the speaker part of the bear, from which the music issued, against her ear just so that she could hear it.  At first Jennie thought that the batteries might need to be replaced, but when Keisha had it play "Jesus Loves Me" again, Jennie could tell that the batteries were okay.  It was just that Keisha needed to have the speaker up to her ear so that she could hear it better.  Then she put it up to Jennie's ear as though that was the only way that Jennie could hear it, too.  The doctors have said that Keisha's hearing loss can get progressively worse.  This is one of the reasons why we're all learning sign language, even Nana, who has come to live with us recently.  I also think that it is great that Keisha herself sees the benefit of having the hearing aids, or "magic ears", as we like to call them.  I think she is aware of how special she is, and that she definitely feels everyone's love.  We all understand that Keisha is exactly how God wanted her.  Everyone in our household, except for the dog, ails with something.  For Keisha, it's her hearing loss.  For my Mom and me, it's our mental illnesses.  For Jennie, it's probably a hormonal imbalance of some kind.  It's very humbling.  Not only that, but it's also encouraging as we continue to remind ourselves that, ailments and all, we are  urlLink "fearfully and wonderfully made" (Psalm 139:13-14) .  Seeing myself - ourselves - in this light is definitely a good thing.

       What's a 'Guidepost'?   You may have wondered why the term 'guidepost' exists in the comments section of my posts for 'Journey Inside My Mind'.  You may have even wondered what a guidepost is.  Here is a definition that I came up with: Guidepost n. 1. A post with a sign giving directions for travelers, usually placed at a crossroad. 2. Something that serves as a guide or an example; a guideline. 3. Any thoughts/advice/critcisms/wittisms/tips you have.   So, fellow travelers on the 'Journey Inside My Mind', feel free to leave any guideposts here, next to the blog entries.  It's way easier than scrawling on the monitor, by the way...

       Philosophizing the Dog   I don't understand dog behavior.  Today it snowed, and, as usual, when I let our 8-month old puppy out, he started running around the yard.  No particular reason why this happened, I guess.  He just sprinted to one end of our yard to other.  And again.  And again.  He'd stop for a moment to see if I was looking at him.  Then he'd dash off again.  And again.  Funny animal, he.  Sometimes I would make like I was going to chase him, and he'd run some more.  And what is this thing with socks, handkerchiefs, and whatnot, that he has to thrash it while he has it in his mouth?  I don't get it.  I don't understand dog behavior, and maybe not for a long time.  Maybe never.

       Alias   I watched 'Alias' last night.  It was nice to see Sydney's mom out of her cell, but I am even more intrigued by the preview I saw of next week's episode.  By the way, I also think that Sloane and Sark should be taken out and have the same things done to them that they have done themselves.  Indeed, I was almost disappointed to find out that Sloane survived the attempted assassination.  I also think that Will Tippin should be recruited into the CIA so that his investigative reporting skills could be put to better use.  There.  I've done it.  Hopefully I haven't spoiled it that much for those who haven't seen the episode yet.  Okay, all you Alias fans -- what do you think?

      "To worry is human; to carry on, divine."  Yet another article about worry and anxiety.  It is a significant part of my life, so that is why I blog about it, in case you were wondering.  Douglas Mennin, PhD, director of the Yale Anxiety and Mood Center, who specializes in the study of worry and generalized anxiety disorder, states: Worry serves a purpose -- it pulls us away from the immediate experience of the problem.  We run things in our head, but we don't act. People who worry all the time are always in their head. That is the problem. We have to move on with our lives. That's how we are able to live in times of uncertainty. That is the skill we learn. People have done this throughout history. Yet another reason to blog.  I praise God for the technology that enables me to pour out my heart here and  urlLink elsewhere .  Blogging and journal-keeping helps me to sort out what I'm feeling.

        urlLink WebMD | Anxiety, Aggression Gene Discovered    According to the article, the January 23 issue of the journal  Neuron  will contain findings of a study indicating that "a genetic abnormality may help explain why some people are more prone to feelings of anxiety and aggression than others."  This appears to me further proof that there exist biological causes behind anxiety and depression.  Now, my natural tendency, when I read this, is to think, "Oh, I'm defective.  That's why I have this problem."  It's then that I need to remind myself that I am "fearfully and wonderfully made" by God.  He doesn't make any junk, knows exactly what he's doing, and has a plan to use me, despite my weaknesses.  In fact, its these weaknesses that are designed to get me to rely more heavily on him.  Amen!

       Written and/or Electronic Journals     urlLink "In addition to blogging, do you keep a written journal?"    In response to my own question (heh heh), I answer with a resounding "YES!"    Readers of this blog may also be aware that I have five(!) blogs that I own.  They are as follows, in the order they were, uh, born:   urlLink Journey Inside My Mind   urlLink Letters to God   urlLink QuotesBlog   urlLink Get That Job!   urlLink Streams of Consciousness  In addition, for several months now I've been a regular contributor to  urlLink The Topics Blog .  Yet, since I'm not strapped to a computer 24/7, I also have been keeping written journals.  Every now and then, I'll post something I've written into one of these blogs, but most of the time, I don't.  One journal is simply called a "personal" journal, in which I write just about everything.  I've recently begun an observation journal, which I've entitled "Sights and Sounds".  I have been enjoying posting in that one a lot lately, because I'm finding that my sense of observation is growing as I continue to work on it.  Heck, I even keep a journal of stuff I'm working on at work (does that sound redundant?).  I got that idea from a former colleague.  Why am I saying all of this?  Well, although it may actually seem that I don't post a lot, I still am writing.  Writing is like an addiction.  Writing is also therapy.  Go figure.

       Paving the Milestones   urlLink    While sorting through some old files and stuff tonight, I came upon a treasure:  my junior year College Prep English class research paper, dated May 11, 1987.  It was entitled "Paving the Milestones (Miles Dewey Davis III)".  The purpose of the research paper was to describe how an important individual has had an impact on society.  I chose to do my research paper on Miles Davis because I was a jazzmaniac (I may need to get that word trademarked, by the way), and loved his music.  Little did I know how much my research into his persona, his "mystique", if you will, would affect me as an individual.  There I was, an insecure junior in high school, struggling to find myself.  And what joy I found by learning about the man,  urlLink Miles Davis , who lived his life caring so much less about what other people thought than what he thought of himself.  I decided to imitate his "devil may care" qualities, and it showed.  Toward the beginning of our research we all were called upon to present some preliminary findings to the class.  Our presentation would be videotaped, and our peers would critique us.  I was unprepared, anxious and insecure, as usual.  But my zeal, enthusiasm, and overal 'jazzmania' (there's that word again), was definitely evident.  I felt like the presentation was a disaster, but then again, I was the first presenter in our teacher's little experiment.  When the time came for us to give a final presentation, I again was chosen to go first.  This time, armed with my own "mystique", I blew the class and my teacher away with an excellent presentation.  First of all, I had purchased a toy trumpet.  I began my presentation, with my back to my audience and played the tune most often heard at the beginning of horse races; it was the only one I knew how to play on that thing.  Secondly, after explaining how Miles pioneered modalism with his album   urlLink Kind of Blue  , I played the opening riff of " urlLink So What " on my alto saxophone.  My peers were, as I said, blown away.  My teacher was impressed with my boldness.  I got an "A".  I remember this event as though it was yesterday, for that moment is one when I saw myself very victorious.

       Bureaucracy at it's Best    This email came from my good friend Jeff I.  More reason why we should reduce the size of government:   Everyone who has ever bought a house can enjoy this.. (or dealt with bureaucrats)  A New Orleans lawyer sought an FHA (Federal Housing Admin) loan for a client.  He was told the loan would be granted if he could prove satisfactory title to a parcel of property being offered as collateral. The title to the property dated back to 1803, which took the lawyer three months to track down.  After sending the information to the FHA, he received the following  reply (actual letter): "Upon review of your letter adjoining your client's loan application, we note that the request is supported by an Abstract of Title. While we compliment the able manner in which you have prepared and presented the application, we must point out that you have only cleared title to the proposed collateral property back to 1803.  Before final approval can be accorded, it will be necessary to clear the title back to its origin." Annoyed, the lawyer responded as follows (actual letter): "Your letter regarding title in Case No. 189156 has been received.  I note that you wish to have title extended further than the 194 years covered by the present application.  I was unaware that any educated person in this country, particularly those working in the property area, would not know that Louisiana was purchased by the U.S. from France in 1803, the year of origin identified in our application.    For the edification of uninformed FHA bureaucrats, the title to the land prior to U.S. ownership was obtained from France, which had acquired it by Right of Conquest from Spain.  The land came into the possession of Spain by Right of Discovery made in the year 1492 by a sea captain named Christopher Columbus, who had been granted the privilege of seeking a new route to India by the Spanish monarch, Isabella.  The good queen, Isabella, being pious woman and almost as careful about titles as the FHA, took the precaution of securing the blessing of the Pope before she sold her jewels to finance Columbus' expedition.  Now the Pope, as I'm sure you may know, is [considered by many at the time to be] the emissary of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and God, it is commonly accepted, created this world.  Therefore, I believe it is safe to presume that God also made that part of the world called Louisiana.  God, therefore, would be the owner of origin and His origins date back, to before the beginning of time, the world as we know it AND the FHA.  I hope the hell you find God's original claim to be satisfactory.  Now, may we have our damn loan?" The loan was approved.

       SUBPOENA DUCES TECUM   Those are words you don't hear every day.  Rarely, if at all, in fact.  We received this notice in the mail a few days ago from the City of Middletown Division of Taxation. Pursuant to the authority granted the undersigned by Section 890.09(b), Ordinance No. 086-22, as amended, City of Middletown, Ohio, you are hereby ordered to appear at the office of the Superintendent of Taxation, One Donham Plaza, Middletown, Ohio on the   30th day of JANUARY 2002, at 11:15AM  to be examined under oath at a hearing concerning your failure to   FILE YOUR 2001 CITY OF MIDDLETOWN INCOME TAX RETURN.  You are further directed to bring with you   all information necessary to file your return, along with the full remittance due including penalty and interest charges.  Failure to comply with this supoena constitues a violation of said Ordinance subjecting you to a fine of not more than $500.00 or imprisonment not more than 60 days or both, as provided in Section 890.09 thereof.  Signed, Linda Davies Stubbs, Superintendent of Taxation  Issued under the authority of Section 890.09, Ordinance no. 086-22, as amended, City of Middletown, Ohio, by the Superintendent of Taxation.  Mailed: January 15, 2003   I kinda prefer the words  urlLink Lorem Ipsum  better.  Or even a summons to perform jury duty.   Update:   We went to the Middletown Tax office this morning and took care of the situation.  A representative from their office completed our 2001 City of Middletown Income Tax return, and it turned out that we only had to pay a little shy of US$256, which is a lot better than a $500 fine or jail time.  I still wouldn't have minded jury duty that much, though.

       Making Pancakes   Another friend of mine, Corky A., who was in my wedding, forwarded this to me: Six-year-old Brandon decided one Saturday morning to fix his parents pancakes. He found a big bowl and spoon, pulled a chair to the counter, opened the cupboard and pulled out the heavy flour canister, spilling it on the floor. He scooped some of the flour into the bowl with his hands, mixed in most of a cup of milk and added some sugar, leaving a floury trail on the floor which by now had a few tracks left by his kitten. Brandon was covered with flour and getting frustrated. He wanted this to be something very good for Mom and Dad, but it was getting very bad. He didn't know what to do next, whether to put it all into the oven or on the stove and he didn't know how the stove worked!)  Suddenly he saw his kitten licking from the bowl of mix and reached to push her away, knocking the egg carton to the floor. Frantically he tried to clean up this monumental mess but slipped on the eggs, getting his pajamas white and sticky.  And just then he saw Dad standing at the door.  Big crocodile tears welled up in Brandon's eyes. All he'd wanted to do was something good, but he'd made a terrible mess. He was sure a scolding was coming, maybe even a spanking. But his father just watched him.  Then, walking through the mess, Dad picked up his crying son, hugged him and loved him, getting his own pajamas white and sticky in the process.  That's how God deals with us. We try to do something good in life, but it turns into a mess. Our marriage gets all sticky or we insult a friend, or we can't stand our job, or our health goes sour. Sometimes we just stand there in tears because we can't think of anything else to do.  That's when God picks us up and loves us and forgives us, even though some of our mess gets all over Him.  But just because we might mess up, we can't stop trying to "makepancakes" for God or for others. Sooner or later we'll get it right, and then they'll be glad we tried...  Please pass some of this love on to others....suppose one morning you were called to God; do all your friends know you love them?  I was thinking ... and I wondered if I had any wounds needing to be healed, friendships that need rekindling or three words needing to be said. Sometimes, "I love you" can heal & bless.  Remind every one of your friends that you love them, even if you think they don't love back.  You would be amazed at what those three little words, a smile, and a reminder like this can do. So I share this with you, and offer this encouragement.  Share this with everyone you love, and make sure to share it again with the person who shared it with you. And never stop "making pancakes"!!!

       Prayer Request   Last week, I received another email from my good friend and sister in Christ, Dana B.  She writes: I have a personal prayer request for everyone.  As most people know I have two girls: Hailie is 6 years old and Stevie is 4 years old.  Well, Hailie had been complaining of lower back pain, so we went to the family doctor who requested an X-ray.  It came back showing what looked like a hairline fracture so we were sent to an orthopedic doctor.    [The orthopedic doctor] looked at the X-ray and agreed he saw something but was not 100% sure, so she had a bone scan done about two weeks ago.  She had her follow up appointment yesterday.  My prayer was answered that it was not cancer or a tumor.  But we were told she has a condition called "Spondylolysis," and basically that means that on her lumbar 5 vertebra, she has a crack where it looks like the fork (I do not know how to totally explain it).    Usually this happens to children that are older and are more athletic.  So they are thinking she was born with it.  But the specialist will be monitoring her to see if it will heal.  If it does not heal, they will try these steps in order:  Physical therapy, Back brace, and last would be Surgery.   Basically what can happen is if it does not heal, the crack can totally break and there would be a shift in that vertebra, and that would cause the nerves to be exposed.  I am understanding this is not a totally crisis condition but I am requesting your prayers that the situation can be stablized and that no more damage will be done.    It is hard to understand that a 6 year old is dealling with this.  If she can have back pain at 6, how will this effect her later in life?  I guess I should not worry about this.  God is already in control and knows the outcome already.  I am at peace with that.  Well, thanks for taking a moment to read about my prayer request.  I love you all.   Your Sister in Christ from Dayton Ohio

       More Customer No-Service  the public school transportation system  Over the last month or so, we've lost much faith in our public school's transportation system.  This morning things came to a head, and I burned with anger once more.  At the beginning of the year we were told what time to expect our daughter's morning and afternoon buses.  Then, within the last month, the morning and afternoon times have been pushed back further and further.  A couple weeks ago, I had called the transportation office and was told that we should call them if the bus was over ten minutes late from what her pickup/dropoff time was.  That time was, in fact, much later than what we were told at the beginning of the school year.  I was quite understanding when told that the reason Keisha's bus was late was because some parents were either not prepared with their kids to leave in the morning or were not at home when the kids were being dropped off in the afternoon.  No problem, I thought.  As long as we know what time we need to have our daughter ready in the morning and what time to expect her when we come home.  We had even begun accomodating the fact that since our daughter was sometimes late for school, she'd miss having breakfast with the other kids at 9:15.  So we'd started giving her something to eat before her bus came.  Again, no problem.  As long as we know what time we need to have our daughter ready in the morning and what time to expect her when we come home.  This morning I received a call from home.  It was mom.  It was already 9:20 and Keisha's bus had still not come.  Mom had a very important doctor's appointment at 10 AM.  She had called the transportation office and was rebuffed by the "Customer No-Service Representative".  So I called.  But, while I was talking, this woman began interrupting me.  I told her to stop doing that, and, finally asked for the name of her supervisor.  She did me one better and proceeded to connect me.    After almost 50 rings, I hung up and searched online for Superintendent Percy Mack's phone number.  The secretary, after hearing my complaint, transferred me to the head of Transportation, a Mr. Sullivan's office.  I voiced my complaint again to his secretary, who then asked for my phone number and promised that she would forward this on to Mr. Sullivan and the transportation person in charge of my daughters bussing.  I then told her that I  expected  a return phone call later today, and we hung up.  Now if I don't hear back after 1 PM, guess who's gonna follow up?

       Super Bowl: Tampa Bay Triumph and Stuff   Okay, I don't have much to say that others haven't already said.  Hence, I won't belabour you with stuff you've already heard.  I just thought it interesting that Tampa Bay's kicker's name was Grammatica.  From what I saw all of his kicks were "Grammatically Correct".  Mom, Jennie, and I remarked that maybe he has a sister named "In".  Hmm.  "In Correct".  I then remarked that maybe he has another brother whose name is "Politically Correct".  Begin throwing your rotten eggs now.

       An 'Alias' To Remember   We somehow managed to stay awake to watch the new episode of 'Alias' last night.  It had been, what, almost two weeks since we'd seen the last new episode, in which some interesting developments regarding Sloane's search for his wife came to fruition.  Well, let's just say that last night's episode, was, indeed, a 'New Beginning'.  So bittersweet throughout the entire episode.  We got to see who Sydney's love is, in fact.  But, I was left in shock at the final scene, which involved the most unexpected plot twist I'd ever imagined.  All I can say is, let the week speed on so that next week's episode will come!

       I Want To Fire My Bank   For some time now, we have been neither been able to access our primary bank account online nor use our debit card.  This past Saturday morning, Jennie and I went to the branch of the bank, the one where we had opened the account five years ago.  We went to a teller and told her what the situation was.    After some initial research, she got her supervisor.  Her supervisor told us that our account had been blocked from access because of the repeated history of overdrafts to our account.  I responded, loud enough for other patrons to hear: "So, we're bad people and we'll no longer be able to access our account?"  "Well, no, Mr. Johnson.  You just need to call our 1-800 number or come into the branch where you opened the account."  "Excuse me, but that's where  I am ," I replied.  "Well, we can clear that up for you, Mr. Johnson.  We just want to warn you that, if your account gets into an overdraft condition again, then your account will get the block on it."  "Okay then," I answered, "so after this, we'll be able to access our account online and use our debit card?"  "Yes."  Then we deposited my paycheck and left, believing that things would be okay.  Page forward to Sunday - yesterday.  On our way home from church, we stopped to fill up our gas tank, using our debit card, which doubles as a 'fake' credit card; i.e., so that we can use it to buy gasoline.  The gas station offered 'pay at the pump', so I kept the car running while I emerged from our car to check if our card would go through.  No such luck.  So we went to the nearest bank branch that we knew would be open on a Sunday, which was inside a local supermarket.  As we walked to the tellers station, we noticed that they had some Super Bowl cookies for customers to enjoy.  We explained our situation to the teller, who then proceeded to get some help from her colleague.  "Hmm.  It seems that your home branch has placed a block on the account on  any  debits."  "We were just there yesterday!" I exclaimed in unbelief.  "Does this mean we can't even write a check to get money out of our account?" again, loud enough for other patrons to hear.  "I'm afraid it does, sir.  Your home branch placed the block, and they have to be the one to unblock the account."  "I thought we took care of that  yesterday !  This is bull!!" I yelled, and proceeded to storm out of the store.  Fortunately, I remembered to wait for my wife and daughter.  After we had gotten into the car, Keisha proceeded to ask, "Do we not have any money, Daddy?"  "I don't want to talk about it right now, Keisha," I replied.  So then she asked Jennie.  "Keisha, I said not to talk about it, okay?"  After some gentle nudging from Jennie, Keisha got the hint.  To add insult to injury, we arrived back home to discover that our car could not make it up our driveway.  Frustrated and angrier, I drove to the end of the cul de sac, turned around and tried again.  Alas, to no avail.  Now, more frustrated and angry, I turned the car around and began to drive in the other direction.  "Why don't we get out and shovel the driveway?"  Jennie asked.  "FINE!"  I said, as I deserted the car, leaving it in neutral with the door open.  Jennie would take over the car, and I would shovel.  I got our shovel, and managed to shovel half the driveway before I ran out of steam.  Frustrated, angry, and tired, I  threw  the shovel across the yard in a fit of rage.  Then I sulked momentarily.  I decided to try again, and got more frustrated that the snow wasn't coming up as easily as I wanted it to.  I began to beat the snow on our driveway, yelling at it, and again threw it across the yard in another fit of rage.  Fortunately, I had cleared enough snow so that Jennie could drive the car up the driveway.  After she had pulled the car into the garage, I picked up the shovel, and put it back in the garage.  Then I went around to the backyard and wept.  I was so frustrated, angry, depressed, and altogether upset.  I sat down against our back wall for a little bit.  Then I noticed that our puppy had emerged from the garage and was on his chain.  He came over and licked me, which helped me feel a bit better.  Then, in a playful mood, I began to throw snow on him, which he appeared to enjoy.  So I piled as much snow on him as I could.  Then I got up, strolled over to the virgin snow in an untouched part of our backyard, and laid myself down.  It was rather peaceful and quiet.  I didn't feel quite so cold yet.  I thought about how I was feeling, prayed to God, and asked for his forgiveness for my fits of rage.  I'm learning that I don't know how to express my anger constructively.  I told Jennie in the car on the way back home that I felt like writing a scathing letter to the president of our bank, using the F-word, the S-word, and the D-word a lot in my letter.  I don't usually curse, but those words seemed appropriate at the time.  As did the thought of tearing the bank manager a new bodily orifice, if you know what I mean.  Jennie remarked that we should have just walked out of the bank office with all of their Super Bowl cookies.

       Thought Process   My friend Bill T. sent this to me via email:  A few years ago, at the Seattle Special Olympics, nine contestants, all physically or mentally disabled, assembled at the starting line for the 100-yard dash. At the gun, they all started out, not exactly in a dash, but with a relish to run the race to the finish and win. All, that is, except one little boy who stumbled on the asphalt, tumbled over a couple of times, and began to cry. The other eight heard the boy cry. They slowed down and looked back. Then they all turned around and went back... every one of them. One girl with Down's Syndrome bent down and kissed him and said, "This will make it better."  Then all nine linked arms and walked together to the finish line. Everyone in the stadium stood, and the cheering went on for several minutes. People who were there are still telling the story.  Why? Because deep down we know this one thing: What matters in this life is more than winning for ourselves. What matters in this life is helping others win, even if it means slowing down and changing our course. What do you think?

       Some quick memories...   A few days ago, I used one of  urlLink my own topics  and came up with some snapshot memories.   1978   Bad blizzard that year.  Schools were closed for awhile.  I remember that we'd get a bunch of homework when we went to class in case schools had to be closed again for awhile.  I went to  urlLink Greener Elementary .  I believe I was in the second grade.   Keego Harbor, Michigan   In the spring and fall of 1990, as well as the spring of 1991, I co-oped for a company in the Greater Detroit area.  I stayed with a coworker, paying him room and board.  He had a house in  urlLink Keego Harbor , which is situated next to  urlLink Cass Lake .  I remember the A&P Supermarket, just down the street.  Some of the best moments were spending time at night on the pier, overlooking the lake and seeing the stars.  There were a couple times, I believe that I went sailing.  I had never sailed before, and the craft we used was not that big, if I remember correctly.  I decided not to go back out sailing, once I found out that in some places the lake was over 90 feet deep.  I have a terrible fear of large bodies of water to begin with, thanks I suppose to movies like " urlLink Jaws ".   Sharon Keys   I had a huge crush on her in fifth grade.  I remember that her best friend was Tracey Grau.  She always made these really goofy looks at me, because I'd stare at her often.

The woman subsequently emailed me and the other guy directions to her place.   And, just for fun, the other guy emailed us directions to his place!

       Daddy and Daughter Date   Last night I took my five-year old daughter Keisha out on a "Daddy and Daughter" date.  Shortly after I arrived home, we left my wife Jennie and my mom, both of whom haven't been feeling that well lately, and drove to  urlLink Huber Heights .  When we got off I-70, we drove to the  urlLink Danbarry Cinemas  to see what was playing.  Keisha and I bought our tickets and then drove to the Huber Heights  urlLink McDonald's , which has a huge PlayPlace.  After getting our food, we sat down in the PlayPlace area to eat.  Keisha was so excited to play that she didn't even open up the  urlLink two toys she had gotten in her Happy Meal .  We had enough time for her to go through the PlayPlace one time before we needed to head back to the movie theatre.  Upon arriving at the movie theatre we bought a box of  urlLink Milk Duds  and proceeded to where " urlLink Spy Kids 2 " was showing.  I let Keisha pick out the place for us to sit, and she chose front row, stage center.  I think that there were only two other people in the theatre with us, but they sat toward the back.  Keisha and I loved the movie, but more importantly, we loved spending the time together doing something we both love to do.  I really enjoy asking her about how her day at school was.  Having been to observe her class a few times, I was able to ask specific questions about different classmates and different activities.  You are not fully aware that so much time has gone by until you see it in your children's lives.  Moments like these are truly golden.

       Boy! It Sure Is Cold Out There!   Only 3 degrees Fahrenheit this morning in Dayton, Ohio USA.  Winds out of the northwest mean that it can feel like -10 to -20 degrees Fahrenheit.  I propose a contest of sorts.  Describe the cold weather using the most outrageous, yet appropriate metaphor or idiomatic expression you can think of.  For example:  It's "Beat-you-up-and-steal-your-lunch-money" cold out there today! It's so cold outside that my nose hairs started to shiver! Let's see what you can come up with!

It may turn out that there is a weak relationship between testosterone and depression in general, but a much stronger relationship between testosterone and depression that does not respond to treatment."   urlLink Read more...

       Comments Controversy   Earlier this week  urlLink JoshSargent  posted his opinion on his blog:  It's turning into a pet peeve of mine to find a blog without comments. Once I see there's no comment application, i usually don't even read it. I believe the interaction of comments from readers take blogging to another level. What are reasons people wouldn't want comments on their blog?  I added the following comments to his post and present them here:  I agree with your post somewhat, Josh. I have purposely not included a comments section in my " urlLink Letters to God " blog, because I know that my temptation would be to include what I think people would want to hear. I do receive comments via email, danimal0416[nospam]@hotmail.com, removing, of course the [nospam], and I am pretty good about responding. In an effort to minimize the temptation to write something because I know people will read it, however, I am not including comments on that particular blog.

        urlLink Fifth Harry Potter Book Due on June 21    Let the countdown begin.  Reuter reports that "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" will go on sale around the world on June 21.  Some "curious" details about the book:  At 38 chapters and 255,000 words, it will be a third larger than "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" The first few sentences of the new book are: "The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet Drive ... The only person left outside was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flowerbed outside number four."  Expect the book to have a darker side than the earlier escapades It also contains the following: Dumbledore lowered his hands and surveyed Harry through his half-moon glasses. "It is time," he said, "for me to tell you what I should have told you five years ago, Harry. "Please sit down. I am going to tell you everything."     urlLink Read more...

       Keisha's Lexicon   Keisha, my five-year old daughter, has her own words for some things.  They are obviously a by-product of her age and the way her speech has developed as a result of her hearing loss.  Still, I find it all very cute! (Sappy Dad moment to follow...)  So, here are a couple entries in Keisha's lexicon:  " Hopper Copper " = helicopter " Hockey Pockey " = Walkie Talkie Additionally, she loves watching PBS Kids, where she gets to watch "Clifford the Big Red Dog".  You may be aware that Clifford's owner is Emily Elizabeth, but Keisha knows her as " Emily Ebizabeth "  With more speech therapy and age, these are sure to vanish from her vocabulary.  I am so happy to have captured them for now.

        urlLink 'Alias'    Last night's episode blew... me... away!  Jennie and I were both taken: hook, line, and sinker.  I love the way the writers just add these plot twists here and there.  That's definitely why I keep watching.  I hesitate in continuing because I do not want to spoil it for those that haven't seen this episode.  Without being too specific, I was pleased in how the investigation into Sloane's wife's disappearance turned out.  It was also good to see Vaughn and Sydney having some time together in a "quasi" romantic moment.  In addition, I was further pleased at the cooperation and general pleasantness between Jack and Irina.  I secretly (well, maybe not secretly now) hope that those two can work things out to get back together.  I have no idea how it could work, though.  I also believe that the way the "quasi" romantic moment between Sydney and Vaughn was handled in a very realistic way; i.e., it was more believable.  There.  I hope that I have fully confused some.  I just had to get it out.

       Empire Strikes Back Trading Cards   While going through some stuff downstairs a few days ago, I found a keepsake box I'd received from my mom during the first plane trip I ever took to Houston, Texas.  I opened it, and, just where I'd placed them a long time ago, were my  urlLink Empire Strikes Back  trading cards!  I remember back in the early '80's, when the movie came out.  It was hip to collect these trading cards.  You'd go to the store and buy the packs, and while chewing the bubble gum that came with them, you'd look to see if you found any new trading cards.  Most of them were single scenes from the movie.  Sometimes you got a file on one of the characters.  Every so often you'd find a painting from one of the scenes.  I had every trading card, except for one.  One that was of  urlLink Lando Calrissian  commenting "Having problems with your droid?".  And I remember so clearly that one of the kids down the street from me had two of them.  Oh how I begged and pleaded with him to trade with me.  Yet he never did.  Now, over 20 years later, I still have an incomplete set.  I wonder how much I could get for it on eBay?

       Thank God for 'Fri-Daze'   I stayed home from work today.  I've been feeling so drowsy lately, and I think it has to do with this medicine I've been taking.  It's called  urlLink Anafranil , and one of the side effects is drowsiness.  The problem arises when I am trying to be active during the day, say like, to go to work, I feel so tired, so I drink coffee or colas to help keep me awake.  Today, I just decided to stay home and rest.  I slept from like 8:30 - 2:30, and I still woke up tired.  I'm going to talk with the psychiatrist on Tuesday and tell him that this medicine is not working.  It's not helping  urlLink the big reason why he prescribed it in the first place , and it's hindering my life as a side effect.

       Backpack Reflections   While going through my backpack this morning I was reminded of something that happened several months ago.  I was walking along Third Street in downtown Dayton.  I passed the Courthouse and as I approached the Montgomery County Administration building, I saw a piece of paper lying on the ground.  I picked it up and noticed that it was a business card from the Law Office of the Public Defender in Montgomery County, Ohio.  I turned the card over and saw the following:    Response to Police Questioning    I understand my constitutional rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during any questioning.  I DO NOT give up those rights.  Please stop questioning me until my lawyer is present.   I have had that card in my backpack until now.  I mean, you never know when you might need the Public Defender, right?  Anyhow...

       Steel Beach BBQ   My friend and brother in Christ, Dave F. is serving in Operation Enduring Freedom somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean.  In a recent email, he mentions something called a "Steel Beach BBQ": Tomorrow we are having a Steel Beach BBQ.  It's call the steel beach because it will be on our flight deck.  We have been out for almost 2 months. It's the command's way of letting us blow off a little steam. Unfortunately we will not see land. This was something I was really hoping for.  Either way I am looking forward to tomorrow. It is the first day we have had to just relax and kick back. It should be fun. I heard talk about a Volley Ball game. I don't see this happening. Diving for the ball on the "Non-Skid" surface will end most peoples game.  Can you say ' Ouch '?

Them : Can you hold on a moment?   Me :  Sure.   Them : (muffled, to a coworker) Can we talk to the husband?. (then to me) This is regarding your _____ account.   Me :  We cannot pay anything on that right now.   Them :  We're showing a balance of $____ that's been past due for some time.   Me : (more emphatically)  We cannot pay anything on that right now.   Them :  We can even take a post-dated check over the phone.   Me :  (more emphatically) We cannot pay anything on that right now.  Here's the situation.  My wife's not working, and I just filed for unemployment, and yet even with that, we're only able to concentrate on certain things like paying the mortgage, the car payment, gas in the cars, and keeping food on the table.  I understand that these calls are sometimes monitored, so I'd like to say this to the person listening as well...   Them : (tries to interrupt)   Me :  It's not that we are not interested in taking care of our outstanding debts, it's just that, given our present circumstances, we're having to concentrate on other things right now.  I understand that, given your nature of business, you'll probably have to make this phone call again, soon, so I guess we'll just plan on have this conversation again in between the times that we screen our incoming phone calls.   Them : I understand.   Me :  Thank you and have a wonderful day.

       Depressed? Look to the Sun   For those of us living in the Northern Hemisphere, the present reality of winter can get us down, especially with the reduced amount of sunlight, according to a recent study.  People with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) develops symptoms of depression during the winter months when there is less daylight.  The study indicates that the brain produces more of the mood-lifting chemical serotonin on sunny days than on darker days -- there is a direct correlation to the duration of sunlight and the rate of serotonin production.  "The researchers say their study shows that the prevailing amount of sunlight clearly affects serotonin levels in healthy individuals, but more research is needed to see if people predisposed to SAD are affected in the same way by environmental factors."   urlLink Read more of the article...

       Franco-American Relations   via email from Mom   An actual letter to home from a Marine with the multinational force in Bosnia:   Dear Dad,   A funny thing happened to me yesterday at Camp Bondsteel (Bosnia): A French army officer walked up to me in the PX, and told me he thought we (Americans) were a bunch of cowboys and were going to provoke a war in Iraq. He said if such a thing happens, we wouldn't be able to count on the support of France.   I told him that it didn't surprise me. Since we had come to France's rescue in World War I, World War II, Vietnam, and the Cold War, their ingratitude and jealousy was due to surface (again) at some point in the near future anyway. I also told him that is why France is a third-rate military power with a socialist economy and a bunch of pansies for soldiers. I additionally told him that America, being a nation of deeds and action, not words, would do whatever it had to do, and France's support, if it ever came, was only for show anyway. Just like in All NATO exercises, the US would shoulder 85% of the burden, and provide 85% of the support, as evidenced by the fact that this French officer was shopping in the American PX, and not the other way around.   He began to get belligerent at that point, and I told him if he would like to, I would meet him outside in front of the Burger King and whip his a** in front of the entire Multi-National Brigade East, thus demonstrating that even the smallest American had more fight than the average Frenchman.   With friends like these, who needs enemies?   Dad, tell Mom I love her.   Your loving daughter  Mary Beth Johnson  LtCol., USMC

       Just Get Happy Already!   I was just visiting  urlLink damash , and had to  urlLink post a comment .  Here's an excerpt from his post: Just browsing round a few different "Christian" blogs, there's one thing that stands out. Most people are not having the best of times. Why is that? Why are we never happy? Do you think it's all to do with your perspective? I do. Think about it. Christians should be the happiest people on earth. If you're a Christian, you have nothing to worry about! You know what your future will be. What you do day to day is important, yes, but what you do in eternity is infinitely more important. You should be able to live your life confidently and happily right now because you know where you'll be spending most of eternity. I might not have been reading his post in context, and it may be that it's 1:15 AM here in Dayton, Ohio USA, but I commented: Dave, I tend to agree with you, although not wholeheartedly. I think it is important to understand that no one can be "UP" 100% of the time. Even Jesus had his moments of sorrow and grief. Some people, myself included, are more predisposed to depression and anxiety than others. God still commands us to be joyful always and not to worry, yet for many, it comes so easily.   Having mental illness is not something that I've been able to accept that easily. I've often felt, "Hey! You're a Christian! Snap out of it, why don't you?" It's not that easy, and it's rather insensitive for someone to think that way.   I'm learning to accept that my mental illness is partly biological in nature, and, I need to do what I can to manage it, but I also need to accept that God still is with me, even during dark times.   I've also learned that you can have Joy despite the circumstances. THAT is where the perspective comes into play. Paul pleaded for the Lord to take away the thorn in his flesh, but Jesus said, "My power is made perfect in weakness." This caused Paul to rejoice in his weaknesses.   That's my two pence. There.  I'm gonna try to get some sleep before Keisha wakes up again.

Well... Snow " and click the link, you won't find the same info I saw when I wrote that post.  Heck, if you click the link now, which I've provided here, you probably won't see the same info I'm seeing.  So, if you're somehow still tuned in here, let me share it with you: Butler oh-champaign oh-clark oh-fayette in-franklin in-greene oh- Miami oh-montgomery oh-preble oh-union in-  1015 PM EST Sat Feb 22 2003   ...Winter weather advisory tonight...   Periods of snow will continue overnight. Snow accumulations of 1 to 3 inches are expected by Sunday morning.  Northwest winds of 20 to 30 mph will cause blowing and Drifting of snow.  Also...Visibilities will be reduced to less than a half mile at times. Snow will gradually end across the region by dawn Sunday morning.     Listen to noaa weather radio and other Media outlets for further  details or updates. Spring is  definitely  my favorite season.

       Dealing with Another's Pain   Acute otis media - that's the medical term for an acute ear infection.  Within the last 48 hours, Keisha has gotten earaches - one for each ear.  She has not been wearing her hearing aids, naturally, so we've been using sign language to communicate with her where needed.  We've wondered whether this is related to her getting her 6-year molars, since she describes pain from the back of her jaw to her ear, as though her 6-year molars were coming in.  Friday night we took her to Urgent Care at Children's Medical Center here in Dayton, and the doctor confirmed that she had an ear infection in her left ear.  Saturday morning Jennie took her to the pediatrician, who diagnosed an ear infection in the right ear as well.  When the pain is present, it exists as a constant hurting, and all she can do is moan in agony.  Fortunately we have her on Children's Tylenol and Motrin, along with the antibiotic Cefzil (insert respective trademarks where applicable).  She just isn't her normal self.  Jennie and I, in a way, appreciate times like these, in which we get to care for our lovely 5-1/2 year old baby girl, yet we also hurt, seeing her in pain.  I can personally relate to the pain that Keisha feels.  From the time I was born until I was about 7 years old, I would get ear infections at least once a year.  My most vivid memory is lying on the couch while my other siblings were around - Mom, too - moaning in agony because the pain was so acute, as I waited for my stepfather to return from the pharmacy with my medicine.  Yet there is someone else who can most definitely relate with the pain Keisha feels: Jesus Christ.  And God the Father can most definitely relate with the hurt I feel for Keisha.  God the Father watched his One and Only child suffer and die.  I praise you, Heavenly Father, for helping me to know you so much better as a result of the present situation with Keisha.  So Jennie and I are doing "round-robin" duty tonight, which means that, as Keisha wakes up, we'll alternatively meet her needs.  I am so grateful to have a Father in Heaven who doesn't need sleep and who provides strength and peace.  He watches over us while we sleep.  It makes me wonder what he thinks about...

       Another Happy Birthday!   Let me give a shout out to my brother in Christ, Dave F., who is currently somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean, serving the USA in Operation Enduring Freedom.  Dave turns 31 today!  I found some good words of wisdom from  urlLink Dr. Seuss  for him: "If you'd never been born, well what would you be? You might be a fish! Or a toad in a tree! You might be a door knob! Or three baked potatoes! You might be a bag full of hard green tomatoes! Or worse than all that... why, you might be a WASN'T! A Wasn't has no fun at all. No, he doesn't. A Wasn't just isn't. He just isn't present. But you... you ARE YOU! And now, isn't that pleasant!" -- Dr. Seuss, from  Happy Birthday To You!

I have read all four books and am eagerly awaiting the arrival of the fifth this June.

       Maybe it's me   Well, hello all.  It may be that I'm using a dialup connection or all those blogrolls I have on this site (gotta do something about that), but I've been dialed in for almost 45 minutes and   I   can't even get this blog to load.  It may also have something to do with other folks trying to get here.  It may also have something to do with a certain publishing company recently getting bought by one of the world's largest search engines.   Reminder: Stay off the 'Mooch List'  (see post from 2/14/2003 3:45 PM for more info) Whatever the case, I'm glad you're here, and I hope you can stay in touch.  Some have wondered, "Where's his email address?"  Good question; I guess I forgot to put it somewhere, so here it is:  danimal0416-at-hotmail-dot-com  You can also leave a comment (We call them 'guideposts' around here.  Get it? 'Guideposts' for the 'Journey'?).  I'm also looking for folks who would like to become an Official of this website.  It doesn't really entail much, except that you stop by every now and then to give an update.  For example,  urlLink Mark C Morris  has asked to become the "Official Iowan of Journey Inside My Mind."  Reminder to self (update the 'OtherBlogs' blogroll to reflect this).

       Living in a Winter Wasteland   Okay, that's probably over-exaggerating it a bit.  Maybe a lot.  I've actually had a great attitude about the wintery storm and the aftermath.  You could even say that I've had a great sense of humor.  We live in a cul de sac, which means that our section of the street is far down on the list when it comes to being plowed.  In fact, it was just yesterday, probably at the request of the Dayton Public Schools, that someone finally came and plowed our street, five days after the storm hit.  We've had some fun moments getting cars unstuck as we've turned into our street, which reminds me of a funny story that happened a few days ago.  Our driveway is on an incline, and, unless we keep it salted, it can be difficult, once we've taken the car out of the garage, to get it back up in the garage.  We've discovered that, if we come down the street at enough speed, we'll have enough momentum to take the car up the hill.  Naturally, there have been a few moments over the last couple of days that we've had to leave the car parked at the bottom of the driveway.  But it takes a lot for  me  to back down.  Well, maybe not that much.  On Monday I really wanted our car to get into the garage for some reason.  I probably didn't want to have to deal with scraping snow or ice off the car - something stupid and trivial like that.   Jennie had just come home from work and, after a brief struggle to get the car up the driveway, she parked it at the bottom.  Let me have a go at it, I thought.   "Man is the only animal that blushes -- or needs to." --  urlLink Mark Twain    So, while she, Mom, and Keisha were inside the nice, warm house, I took up the gauntlet.  I hoppe in the car, put it in reverse and headed down to Hillcrest, the major road that is only about 500 feet from our house.  I turned right and head down a few blocks.  Noticing that there wasn't much traffic in either direction, I decided to pull a stunt.  I yanked the emergency brake and turned the car left so that it could spin around quickly, which it did.  Then, Mr. Stuntdriver, took off, heading back toward our street.  I paused to let oncoming traffic pass, and then I gunned it and made the left turn onto our snow/ice/slush-covered street, and the car immediately slid over, getting stuck on the side of the road.  No problem, I thought.  We only live 500 feet away, so I turned the car off and ran - if that's what you call trudging in winter boots and the slush/ice/snow mix - back home to get our shovel, hoping that Mom and Jennie didn't notice me.  Too late.  They'd already noticed me pulling the car away from the driveway moments before.  "No, I don't need any help.  I've got it under control.  Thanks!" Mr. Prideful said.  I "ran" back to the car and began digging out around it.  A few minutes later, some neighbors drove by, and seeing the predicament I'd gotten myself into, got out to help.  I got in the car while they tried to push the car out of the way.  No luck at first.  Well, then, I look toward our house, and I see Jennie and Mom, now dressed up in their winter coats, heading my way.  Mom thought she was going to help push.  Yeah, right.  If there is a gene for pridefulness, I may have inherited it from her.  Mom, with fibro myalgia and other back problems.  Four foot eleven inches Mom.  I appreciated her heart and desire to help, but I didn't want her to jeopardize her own health in the process.  She made a good supervisor anyhow.  Jennie climbed into the car and, combined with our neigbors pushing and me wielding the snow shovel, she was able to drive the car out of where it was stuck.  Then she drove it back to the bottom of the driveway, where it was before.  It was good exercise and helped to relieve the boredom, though.

       Letter from Boot Camp - A Letter From a Farmer, now at Camp Pendleton  --  from Steve K.'s forwarded email:    Dear Ma & Pa; Am well. Hope you are. Tell brother Walt & Brother Elmer the Marine Corps beats working for old man Minch by a mile. Tell them to join up quick before maybe all of the places are filled.   I was restless at first because you got to stay in bed till nearly 6 a.m., but am getting so I like to sleep late. Tell Walt & Elmer all you do before breakfast is smooth your cot and shine some things. No hogs to slop, feed to pitch, mash to mix, wood to split, fire to lay. Practically nothing. Men got to shave but it is not so bad, they git warm water.   Breakfast is strong on trimmings like fruit juice, cereal, eggs, bacon, etc..., but kind of weak on chops, potatoes, ham, steak, fried eggplant, pie and other regular food. But tell Walt & Elmer you can always sit between two city boys that live on coffee. Their food plus yours holds you till noon, when you get fed again. It's no wonder these city boys can't walk much.   We go on "route" marches, which the Platoon Seargent says are long walks to harden us. If he thinks so, it is not my place to tell him different. A "route march" is about as far as to our mailbox at home. Then the city guys get sore feet, and we all ride back in trucks. The country is nice, but awful flat. The Seargent is like a schoolteacher. He nags some. The Capt. is like the school board. Majors & Colonels just ride around & frown. They don't bother you none. This next will kill Walt & Elmer with laughing.   I keep getting medals for shooting. I don't know why. The bulls-eye is near as big as a chipmunk and don't move. And it ain't shooting at you, like the Higgett boys at home. All you got to do is lie there all comfortable and hit it. You don't even load your own cartridges. They come in boxes. Be sure to tell Walt & Elmer to hurry & join before other fellers get into this setup & come stampeding in.   Your loving daughter, Gail   P.S. Speaking of shooting, enclosed is $200 towards a new barn roof & ma's teeth. The city boys shoot craps, but not very good.

       No Contest   I recently received an email from an acquaintance who is in training as a truck driver.  He mentioned a close call he had as he was driving down a mountain highway.  He also advised to never, if you're involved in an accident, openly apologize to someone else, because that opens you up for a lawsuit.  I can tend to agree with that.  I was involved in a car accident in 2000.  It had been raining and I was following the car ahead of me too closely and rear-ended them.  I had received a ticket and had heard from  urlLink Clark Howard , a nationally-syndicated consumer advocate, whose show is broadcast on AM radio in our area, that even paying the traffic ticket in that case could be considered an admission of guilt and open myself up to a lawsuit.  I sought advice from a lawyer, who recommended that I go to court and plead 'No Contest'.  That way, if I was found guilty, I still wouldn't be openly admitting it.  Other than having to take some time off work, God really blessed me.  The judge wound up finding that I was guilty, but he let me off without having to pay a fine and even waived the court costs, provided that I never show up in his courtroom again.  So all I got were some points against my driver's license.  God even provided for us to be able to get financed for a slightly-used car.

       Get Off The Mooch List   You know who you are.  You stop by the website, checking things out, but you never let me know you're here.  You take and take and take.  But that's okay.  I'm not disappointed in you.  I want to give you an opportunity to get off the Mooch List and reveal yourself.  You can leave me a comment (we call them 'guideposts' around here) or you can send me an email at danimal0416[nospam]@yahoo.com (leave out the '[nospam]', of course).  In either case, just tell me that you want to get off the 'Mooch List'.    I'll even let you become an official part of this site, if you'd like.  For example, if you're a Java programmer, you can become the Official Java Programmer for Journey Inside My Mind.  Then you can tell everyone that you are an important person, because you are.  To me.  I look forward to hearing from you.

       Valentine's Day   Here are a couple reasons why Valentine's Day is special for me this year:  One year ago, on February 14, 2002, you could say that this blog,  urlLink Journey Inside My Mind , gave birth to two additional blogs.  They are  Letters to God   urlLink Current page   urlLink First post   and QuotesBlog   urlLink Current page   urlLink First post   Over the last year these blogs have been very useful to me, and I look forward to continuing to update them as the days go by.   More importantly  , however, what makes this year's Valentine's Day special is that it was on February 14, 1993 that I asked  urlLink Jennie  Doddy if she would be my steady girlfriend.  I'll have to blog the story behind that some other time, but for now, let's just say that my life has been oh so different (much better) since then!  I fell in love with her and told her so for the first time on Memorial Day weekend 1993, and by October 1993, I was convinced that she was the one for me.  The rest is history, which also makes up for good content on blogs, by the way.

       Blogging the Past   I'd like to do some more writing, but I feel a bit distracted by this sinus infection.  So I've taken to adding quotes to my  urlLink QuotesBlog .  This exercise has been interesting in that I've been going through old planner pages, since they had daily quotes on them.  In addition to culling the quotations, I'm also reading what I'd written for those particular days.  For instance, I'm currently travelling back in time to six years ago, 1997, the year that Keisha was born.  I'm amazed now, as I look back, that I was able to get anything done.  My job was totally overwhelming me, and, of course, we were getting ready for our new baby.  Here are some interesting items of note:   Monday, January 13, 1997:   Jennie has some stuff on her heart that she needs to talk to me about.  To work or not after the baby is born?  To work part-time during the rest of the pregnancy, if it's doctor's orders?  Will our insurance cover the cost of birthing classes?  Monday, January 20, 1997:   Jennie missed her bus and caught another one home.  On her way back from the bus stop, she slipped and fell, landing on her right hip.  Called doctor and waiting to hear back.  We got to bus stop late.  We left home late.  We weren't really ready for the morning.  Doctor called back - baby should be fine.  Jennie should take it easy and drink fluids.  Tuesday, January 21, 1997:   Mom and Paul separated.  Can't go into details right now.  Pray for them.  Her new number to come later.  Friday, January 24, 1997:   Mark (my boss at the time) told me that Materials Inventory due this coming Monday afternoon.  Convicted me about my time management.  Sunday, February 16, 1997:   Felt baby moving!  Heard it moving!  Thursday, February 20, 1997:   Stayed at work until 2 AM 2/21 working on SARA 312/RPCC inventory.  Friday, February 21, 1997:   Chris Hayes encouraged me.  Monday, February 24, 1997:   Learned that Rob and April had lost their baby  Sunday, March 2, 1997:   Ate dinner together with Dad, June, Jason, and Amber  Thursday, March 6, 1997:   Purchased baby swing, booster seat, and playpen from Beckie Roberts.  Saturday, March 8, 1997:   Met WHIO-AM late afternoon talk show host Kent Voss at the Baby Fair at Hara Arena.  Introduced myself as his "Official Environmental Engineer."  Wednesday, April 2, 1997:   Paid for bookcase and baby's dresser in full.  Thanks to Randy and Tony for helping out.  Thursday, April 3, 1997:   Jennie noticed some spotting.  I came home early from work.  Had ultrasound performed at Dayton Medical Imaging.  Got pictures.  Girl.  That's about as far as I've gotten.  I am so glad I recorded some of these things.  Especially now, since we're coming up on the 6-year anniversary of them happening.  Did you know that every six years the date is on the same day of the week?  It would be seven years if we didn't have a leap year somewhere in that period.  I wish I could express my feelings about reading through these memories.  The stuff going on at work would eventually lead to my separating from them in September 1997.  As of April 3, 1997, we could now officially call our baby Keisha.  I'm close to tears even now as I type this.  I've only included small bits that I'd recorded.  So many other things were recorded back then, that are important within the context of my life.  It definitely feels profound to me.

       'Focus' ing on Ford   Speaking of 'Alias',  urlLink earlier , I was reminded at how Ford Motor Company positioned itself during last night's episode.  During one commercial break, Ford did a commercial, touting its new Ford Focus.  Then, as we resumed watching the episode, we were treated to a high-speed scene involving Agents Vaughn and Bristow driving none other than a Ford Focus.  We could tell because for one moment during the scene, the camera zoomed in to show the brand logo on the car, which was a nice-looking, brand-new blue model.  Do I smell a trend?

       The Sinus 'Crud'   I forgot to mention yesterday that our family, except for my daughter and the dog, are sick with sinus infections.  Yesterday, Jennie and I went to our old family doctor, and, since we don't have health insurance right now, paid for the office visits out of our own pocket: $51 each for the office visits, totaling $102.  Then we went to the pharmacist to get our prescriptions filled, again paying out of our own pocket: $181 for three prescriptions, two of which were not available in generic form.  Because my mom receives MedicAid for her medical stuff, her office visit and medicine didn't cost us any out-of-pocket money.  Nevertheless, I was a bit upset for having to pay so much for medical care, and I prayed on the way home for God to help me be grateful that we even had the money and access to the medical care.  I also prayed for the medicine to do its job.  Ultimately, God is in control, and I need to trust in him.  I guess that is one of the biggest things I am learning in my life:  that I need to concentrate on the stuff that I can handle and leave the rest up to God.  I encourage you to please pray for us, as these new circumstances just add to the strenuous ones we're already dealing with.

        urlLink Could Depression Cost You Your Job?    crossposted at  urlLink Get That Job!    According to this WebMD article, it could if you don't seek help for it.  People with depression are more likely to call in sick and be otherwise unproductive at work.   In a study that tracked 5000 people over five years, the researchers found that "42% of those who showed symptoms of depression in the study's first year eventually lost their jobs."  Lead researcher Mary A. Wooley, MD, writes: There's a huge stigma associated with depression.  People need to realize that depression is a disease just like diabetes and that there are plenty of treatments that offer relief from suffering and can also help you keep your job. People need to overcome the stigma and not be so embarrassed about saying: 'I need help.'

        urlLink MSNBC - News of the Weird     Edward Blaine, 61, who served 20 years in prison for a 1963 bank robbery, apparently is becoming even less competent with age, as he was arrested in January and charged with robbing the Union Bank & Trust branch in Port Royal, Va. Police said Blaine fled with the stash while $100 bills were falling out of his pockets, and then he realized as he arrived at his getaway car that he had locked the keys inside. He grabbed a log to smash the window but tossed it away in frustration, only to have it hit Emmett Lowe's truck, thus angering Lowe, who grabbed a gun and chased Blaine for 150 yards. In a struggle, Blaine shot at Lowe but hit himself in the leg, just before Lowe shot Blaine in the same leg. [Washington Times, 1-17-03]

       You Know It's 2003 When...   Your reason for not staying in touch with family is because they do not have e-mail. You have a list of 15 phone numbers to reach your family of three. Your grandmother asks you to send her a JPEG file of your newborn so she can create a screen saver. You pull up in your own driveway and use your cell phone to see if anyone is home. Every commercial on television has a web site address at the bottom of the screen. You buy a computer and 3 months later it's out of date and sells for half the price you paid. Leaving the house  without your cell phone, which you didn't have the first 20 or 30 (or 60) years of your life, is now a cause for panic and you turn around to go get it. Using real money, instead of credit or debit, to make a purchase would be a hassle and take planning. You just tried to enter your password on the microwave. You consider second-day air delivery painfully slow. Your dining room table is now your flat filing cabinet. Your idea of being organized is multiple-colored Post-it notes. You hear most of your jokes via e-mail instead of in person. You get an extra phone line so you can get phone calls. You disconnect from the Internet and get this awful feeling, as if you just pulled the plug on a loved one. You get up in the morning and go online before getting your coffee. You wake up at 2 AM to go to the bathroom and check your E-mail on your way back to bed. You start tilting your head sideways to smile. ) You're reading this and nodding and laughing. Even worse; you know exactly with whom you are going to share this...

        urlLink Wired News: Net Widens Phone Options for Deaf    This news about AT&T's recent launch of its  urlLink Video Relay Service , another option for deaf and hearing-impaired people to communicate with others, is good news, provided that you have a PC, webcam, and a high-speed internet connection.  Most of my deaf friends don't have this yet.  According to the article, with the above-mentioned configuration, "a deaf person signs in American Sign Language to an interpreter.  The interpreter then speaks to the hearing person on the other end of the line."  The most common method of communication for deaf and hearing-impaired people is to type a message in a TTY or a TDD (telecommunications device for the deaf), which transmits it to an operator, who then relays the message to a hearing person on the other end.  Promising news.

(fanfare, jubilee, uh oh, the  urlLink PETA  police are coming!)  "Grilled, seasoned to perfection."  My mouth waters as I type those words.  So tender, I must have gone to the buffet about 4 or 5 times.  "This is better than dessert!" I exclaimed to the group of folks at the neighboring table, who kept glancing at me with these weird looks on their faces.  "I guess I should be careful," I muttered. "I wouldn't want to OD (overdose) on steak now, would I?" Smiles.  Snickers.  Grins.  "Although there are worse fates than 'Death by Sirloin'!"  Actual chuckles.  So steak has now risen to the top spot in my list of favorite foods.  Pizza had previously been the leader, but now, alas, it resides at number two.  Now I know what to ask Santa for when Christmas rolls around this year!

       Yesterday I Visited My Past   After  urlLink church in Cincinnati  yesterday, we bought a Kodak single-use camera and drove around the northwestern suburbs of Cincinnati to the places I used to live.  I'd stop by the houses and take a picture of what they look like now.  I also stopped by some of the schools I used to attend.  So many memories, so hard to capture in just a single photograph.  Especially since it's been so many years ago.  The playgrounds are different, the running track has become unkempt.  Names of schools have changed somewhat, and people have done some extensive remodeling to houses where I grew up.  In a way, I was jealous.  I often long to go back to those times, to relive those moments, the pleasant and unpleasant.  Things seemed so much bigger back then than they are now.  I don't want those memories to be forgotten, lost forever.

       Keisha Update   I just sent the following email to the evangelist of our church: This afternoon Jennie and I took Keisha to see her audiologist to get an update on her hearing.  We've had reason to suspect that she's lost more hearing.  Our suspicions were correct; she has lost even more hearing.  The audiologist was able to boost her hearing aids to their maximum capacity.  She has encouraged us to have the ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist) check Keisha out again.  She also has advised us to begin considering a cochlear implant(CI) for Keisha.  I'm not sure if you know what a CI involves, but I'll give you a little bit of info.  Basically, a surgeon drills a hole in Keisha's head and attaches an electrode to her auditory nerve.  Once that heals over, she then gets fitted with a magnet that attaches to her head an leads to a receiver in her ear.  The receiver looks a little like a hearing aid.  There's probably a website I could direct you to, but I don't have the link right now.  Please pray for us.  We're considering getting a second opinion, but we're also recognizing that this direction may be where we have to go.  Love in Christ,  Dan, Jennie, and Keisha

       Email from the Battlefront  I've posted somewhat frequently the emails I receive from a brother in Christ who is serving in the US Navy as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  In his latest email, he writes: Hi!!  How is everyone there? I am doing fine. We have not had anything big happen since the last email I sent. I am kind of bummed though. There are disciples here that I have been emailing.  Many of them are American service members like myself but there are others who are the ones you hear about in  urlLink KNN . The Disciples who are nationals and trying to make it in a Muslim world. Three times already we were supposed to make a port visit. I was looking forward to meeting these disciples. Anyway it looks like our next port visit will be yanked also. One of the biggest things I have been looking forward to in the Navy is being able to meet disciple around the world. Enough of that though.  I got the poster everyone signed for me. I thought it was great. I spent a lot of time going through all of the names and telling people in my shop cool stories of each person who signed it. I also got a photo of the Military Bible Talk I was part of in Pensacola. The poster you sent me and the photo from Florida serve as a constant reminder that though I am away from the Body, I am not alone out here. I can not explain how important that is. Thanks for all of the encouragement you send me. Hopefully I'll be able to make a visit in the next few months. Thinks for everything and I love you all.

       A Dream of Apocalyptic Proportions   I had one of the weirdest dreams last night.  It was very vivid.  It was about an Anthrax epidemic that occurred during Hitler's reign.  I got to follow it from the first strain, which was "alien".  Someone thought the particle/being/thing looked interesting, and they picked it up and got infected.  Moments later, a group of scientists head to this lab that has done most of the research on a vaccine.  The head of the American group had this disrespectful attitude toward this one other scientist from the research lab, who seemed to be "mentally deficient" in some way.  This disrespectful scientist was questioning, almost ordering everyone, trying to find out what could be done about it.  Then this eccentric scientist revealed himself to the first one.  He had interviewed the first man for a job with this lab many years ago.  This eccentric man took the first one to a safe, opened it, and pulled out several vials.  "What are those?" the first one asked.  "Purity vials," the other replied.  The first understood that they were pure vaccines that could be reproduced to give to others.   I guess I could apologize for this sounding so disjointed, but I just want this to get out before I forget it.   In my dream, when the flashback between the American doctor and the elder, more eccentric doctor, occurs, and the American doctor realizes that he had interviewed for a job with the other doctor, and interesting thing occurred.  As a gesture of his rejection, the elder doctor forcibly kissed the other on the lips, in a homosexual kind of way.  Really weird to me at the time.  So the doctor had just found the "Purity vials".   (BTW, this whole dream sounds like it could have been an "X-Files" episode or something.)   Then, an explosion occurs, and everyone in the lab dies.  Except for me.  The vials... I cannot remember what happened to them.  I begin to wonder, "Where is a good place to find refuge?"  Then I remember where I grew up:  Mt. Healthy.  Mount Healthy was where several people settled as a refuge from the cholera virus that had occurred in Cincinnati, Ohio a long time ago.  Mt. Healthy sounded like a great place to go.  I then remember heading into a stadium that would be a safe haven from the epidemic, but somehow, others that are infected find us, and I somehow get infected.  Then Hitler shows up for a rally.  All I can think about is to get close to this evil madman, so that I can somehow infect him, too.  And then I wake up.  Okay, all you readers out there.  Who wants to interpret the dream for me?  I have my own ideas, which I may post some other time.

        urlLink Request for Prayer    from Rich Garner - Military Support Ministry - Friday, March 14, 2003  As moderator for the Military Support Ministry on UpCyberDown, I often get requests for contact information, church locations, and other tid bits that help our deployed brothers and sisters stay connected to the fellowship. But recently, my inbox has been swamped with a frightening amount of email... questions, concerns, pleas... regarding one haunting threat; war.  Several brothers have informed me of their deployment plans and have requested that I put them in touch with Christians in their deployment locations. Some have announced their support for the U.S. troops. Others have voiced concerns over Biblical implications of the situation in the Middle East region. But the one reason I felt compelled to write this is the need for prayers. Not only do I get prayer requests in my Military Support inbox, but also my church email and the message boards that I moderate.  Recently, a brother contacted me and asked that we get a prayer request out to all the churches around the world. After seeing miraculous repentance and efforts at unity within the International churches, I believe this is an attainable goal.  I realize that our military ministries are comprised of hundreds of different nations... but all of us will be affected in some way or another by the US led invasion of Iraq. Therefore, on behalf of all brothers and sisters in arms that are in harms way, faithful family and friends back home and concerned Christians everywhere, I am requesting a day of prayer on Sunday March 23th, 2003, from all churches that are able to read this message.   The goal is for each church to offer prayers and petitions to God for 24 hours beginning any time on Sunday March 23th, 2003. Each church would decide the best way to accomplish the goal.  (If some churches are reading this article after March 23th, be faithful that God will still hear your prayers on any day after that.)    The purpose of the prayer day is to ask God for three things:  Protection and safe return home (wherever home may be)  for everyone involved in the war, Wisdom, peace and faith that only Jesus can bring in times of war and Successful spread of His Word throughout the Middle East region. The Bible tells us that Jesus will not return until the Word of God has been preached to the entire world. Therefore I believe our prayers should focus on the Word of God being powerfully spread throughout the region and the baptism of everyone in those nations. Peace of mind and protection from harm should also be asked as well as increasing faith as we see God work miracles in a land of conflict.  So, I put this to every God-fearing, Christ-loving person who reads or hears this message. Let our voices unite in praise and worship and let us ask of our Father what He has promised us in John 14:13... "And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father."  And to God be the Glory, Rich Garner

       Updates to Past Posts Needed   Just so that you know, I am needing to post some updates to some past posts; namely, the  urlLink Swiffer WetJet  and the  urlLink McDonald's   urlLink ones .  So there.  This post will probably be changed to include that information.  Stay tuned, gentle readers!   First Up: McDonald's   I recently posted  urlLink an email response I'd received from McDonald's Corporate Customer Service .  About a week later I received a couple phone calls and then a letter from the local office manager responsible for the franchise in question.  Here is the text of her letter: March 20, 2003  Dear Mr. Johnson,  Thank you for letting us know about your recent experience at our McDonald's at 4770 N. Main St., Dayton, Ohio.  I am sorry that our attendant was rude to you and did not five you the prices you requested.  The employees should always answer your questions and be polite and helpful.  Our goal is 100-percent customer satisfaction and our team works hard to deliver fast, friendly, and accurate service to guarantee that each visit you make is a pleasant one.  It appears that we've let you down, and for that, I apologize.  I have discussed your experience with our restaurant team.  You can be assured that we're taking corrective action so a similar incident will not reoccur.  Again, thank you for taking the time to bring this matter to my attention.  The best way we can improve is if people who aren't satisfied tell us so, and tell us why.  You've given me the opportunity to make our restaurant better and hopefully exceed your expectations on your next visit.  Please give us another chance and "Be Our Guest" with the enclose gift certificate.  We look forward to serving you better in the future.  Sincerely,  Paula Sullivan Office Manager This afternoon my wife Jennie and I returned to this McDonald's, and we experienced much better service.  I was treated to a double quarter pounder with cheese extra value meal, supersized, for free.  When Jennie asked if they had the double fish fillet sandwich meal, they were able to give her the price.  I believe that this McDonald's has redeemed itself, and I want you to know that.   Next Up:  Swiffer Wet Jet   In January  urlLink I posted  about an offer to call a phone number to receive a coupon for a free Swiffer wet jet mop.  This claim is false.  The coupon was for $5 off the purchase price for a Swiffer wet jet mop.  The offer expired February 2003.  Check out the  urlLink Swiffer page over at Snopes.com .  Please accept my apology for spreading false information.

       Hailie's Back   Hailie is a  six-year old little girl  who is experiencing some vertabrae slippage.  It causes some serious back pain.  I received this email from her mother, Dana, today: hey just want to let everyone know hailie got her back brace yesterday.  because she is so petite that had to special order the brace.  and even yesterday they had to do alterations.  at first she was excited but they having to be in it she started to grow tired of it quickly.  the brace goes from the bottom of her ribs to her pelvic bone.  it is so material and has a cast insert to go into a back panel.  so i know that i will need to really push her to wear it as much as possible.  i do not want to "threaten" her with the surgery.  but i know i do not want that either.  i really do hope the brace will stop the vertabrae from slipping any more.  well, i hope all is well with everyone.  take care.  dana, hailie and stevie

       From Powerless to Powerful   Yesterday, we had the power turned off here at home.  We later contacted the utility company and made a payment toward our utility bill.  About 45 minutes ago, the power was turned back on.  It was interesting last night, living like pioneers, candles and such.  We also got a bunch of batteries for flashlights and radios.  More to come possibly later.

       Link Frustrations   Okay.  Here's the deal.  I created a single page for  urlLink my favorite links .  I then added it to the template for this blog (see the right menu, in the Links section).  I even included it on my own homepage,  urlLink "Dan's Domain" .  My problem is that, today, since I've added the links to my Links page (hope I'm not sounding redundant), when I test the link to the Links page, the page won't load.  However, when you go to the page directly from the URL, it does work.  Copy the following URL to your browser to see what I'm talking about:  http://www.geocities.com/danimal0416/links.html Maybe it's only me.  Maybe it's only for today.  Tomorrow may be different.  You may have a different experience.   Update:   I slapped myself and rechecked the HTML for the link on the right menu.  There was one too many "t's" in the URL.  I have fixed it.  I feel good.  I feel better.  I feel better than James Brown.  I feel better now.

       Message from our Natural Gas Supplier   I just received an email from Vectren, our natural gas supplier.  It reads: Dear valued customer and registered user of Vectren.com,   Due to colder than normal temperatures this winter and significantly rising natural gas prices throughout the country, utility bills nationwide have increased considerably prompting many customer inquiries. Vectren is working diligently, through our customer contact center, our web site, bill inserts and the mass media, to help better explain how these factors are impacting our customers. The significant volume of customer inquiries to our contact center has unfortunately created delays for customers wanting to speak with Vectren customer service specialists.    Therefore, if you have questions or concerns about this winter's gas costs and their impact, including specific line items on your bill, how to make your home more energy efficient or obtain utility assistance, please visit the "Cold Weather and Your Natural Gas Bill" section on the front page of  urlLink www.vectren.com .   We hope this 24-hour accessible tool will help you understand the issues surrounding the winter heating season.  Thank you for your patience and understanding. Your Vectren bill should be arriving soon if you have not already received it.   Sincerely, Vectren Customer Care

       This Thing Is Real   This recent email comes from my friend and brother in Christ, Dave F., who is serving in the US Navy on an aircraft carrier during Operation Iraqi Freedom:  Hi!!  How is everything on the home front?  Reality came to some of us today. I can't go into detail on this, but as a stretcher carrier I saw things I wished I could unsee.  I did what I could to help out. When it was all over I went and sat on my rack and prayed for a bit. The cost of war is high but sometimes necessary. I just pray that God uses the outcome to further open the door for him to be introduced to the people. Otherwise the loss of life and worldly liberation of Iraq will be for naught. I'm also praying that what ever happens, for this to be short to keep the losses on both sides low. I am sorry this is not a happy email.   Outside of that things have been pretty normal. The Chiefs and some Officers were working in our galley today. It was kind of fun to watch. The food was better than normal.  I mentioned that to one chief and jokingly asked what we had to do to get them to continue working in our galley. My senior chief was working in the scullery (sink area).  I saw him at one point as he was pushing a cart full of plates lift himself up and ride it briefly like a kid does a shopping cart in a store. That was amusing and a good break from the day's earlier events.  I have to go now. What I did today was only a fraction of what could have been. When you think about us out here pray for those disciples who are ashore and going through this. They are in the thick of this and dealing with it on a more personal basis. In the meantime I am still praying for you and the Body.  I still see the changes you are going through as a time for strengthening.  'Rumor' has it we may see land sometime in the next few weeks. I can not specify when, but from everyone I have talked to, the date has been constant.  Hopefully we can meet then. I am not holding my breath on this, but please pray that it happens.  We were supposed to see land twice already but those plans got yanked.  Of all the ships that came out with us, ours and one other ship are the only ones that have not visited land.  I would so much like to visit the disciples here.  YBiC (Your Brother in Christ),  Dave

       Pecans in the Cemetery   via email from Steve K.   On the outskirts of a small town, there was a big, old pecan tree just inside the cemetery fence.  One day, two boys filled up a bucketful of nuts and sat down by the tree, out of sight, and began dividing the nuts.  "One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me," said one boy. Several dropped and rolled down toward the fence.  Another boy came riding along the road on his bicycle. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to investigate.  Sure enough, he heard, "One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me."  He just knew what it was. "Oh my", he shuddered, "it's Satan and the Lord dividing the souls at the cemetery."   He jumped back on his bike and rode off.  Just around the bend he met an old man with a cane, hobbling along. Come here quick," said the boy, "you won't believe what I heard!  Satan and the Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls."  The man said, "Beat it kid, can't you see it's hard for me to walk."   When the boy insisted though, the man hobbled to the cemetery. Standing by the fence they heard, "One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me..."  The old man whispered, "Boy, you've been tellin' the truth. Let's see if we can see the Lord himself."  Shaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of the Lord.   At last they heard, "One for you, one for me."  And one last "One for you, one for me. That's all.  Now let's go get those nuts by the fence, and we'll be done."  They say the old man made it back to town a full 5 minutes ahead of the boy on the bike.

       Music In My Mind, revisited   I first posted about this on  urlLink February 27, 2003 , after finding out about it via  urlLink Anne Wilson .  Today, I found an article in  urlLink WebMD  about the same thing.  This time, however, there is a list of the top 10 songs that get stuck in people's heads.  Worth a read.  Definitely.  I still don't think that it's all a bad thing.  I recall taking exams in high school and college and having music in my head, most of the time, it was music I had been listening to while I'd been studying.

       Restoration!    That was the subject line of this email I got from a former coworker, K.B.  His message reads as follows:  Dan,   I know it's been a while since I've talked to you. I guess I can hold a grudge as well as the next guy!  But the reason that I'm emailing you now is to apologize for that.  I should have gotten over what you did and moved on and forgiven you.  Instead I broke off all relationship and didn't want anything more to do with you.  For that I apologize.   Also, it appears that you especially need prayer for you and your family at this time since I've heard from T.C. that you have fallen on hard times and barely had steady work since you left [company name].  Dan know that I forgive you for what ever the issue might have been!  Also know that I will be praying for restoration in your life and that of your family; your mental health, full-time work, family relationship, etc., In the Holy and Mighty Name of JESUS! It's already done!   Know that we still care about you here and want only good things for you. Be encouraged today that everything will work out! Be Blessed!

At 1,000 feet, the pilot drops the F/A-18C Hornet to increase his speed to 750 mph, vapor flickering off the curved surfaces of the plane. In the precise moment a cloud in the shape of a farm-fresh egg forms around the Hornet 200 yards from the carrier, its engines rippling the Pacific Ocean just 75 feet below, Gay hears an explosion and snaps his camera shutter once."   urlLink Read more and see the picture...

       Encouraging Email    This afternoon I received an encouraging email from my friend and brother in Christ, Greg V. : Hi Dan,  I just wanted to write and let you know that you were in my prayers today.  I know sometimes each of us may go through difficult emotions that we don't understand, and I wanted to write to ask if you are feeling better today than yesterday, and to encourage you. I think you are awesome, and that you inspire me in a couple ways. It occurs to me I've never shared them with you, and that now is as good a time as any.  When I think about you, you are the only man who I have ever seen literally stop a car to share your faith with a stranger. You have courage to lead songs with passion, and I have tried to emulate that.  Finally, when I become a parent someday, I wish to remember how you were in Kingdom Kids with the little ones.  I hope that knowing how you have impacted me as my brother will brighten your day.  Best, Greg

       U.N. Inspection Teams    This tongue-in-cheeck report comes via email from Dave F., who is serving in Operation Enduring Freedom:  Have you noticed anything fishy about the inspection teams who have arrived in Iraq?  They're all men!   How in the name of the United Nations does anyone expect  men  to find Saddam's stash? We all know that men have a blind spot when it comes to finding things. For crying' out loud!  Men can't find the dirty clothes hamper. Men can't find the jar of jelly until it falls out of the cupboard and splatters on the floor.... and these are the people we have sent into Iraq to search for hidden weapons of mass destruction?  I keep wondering why groups of  mothers  weren't sent in. Mothers can sniff out secrets quicker than a drug dog can find a gram of dope. Mothers can find gin bottles that dads have stashed in the attic beneath the rafters. They can sniff out a diary two rooms and one floor away. They can tell when the lid of a cookie jar has been disturbed and notice when a quarter inch slice has been shaved off a chocolate cake. A mother can smell alcohol on your breath before you get your key in the front door and can smell cigarette smoke from a block away. By examining laundry, a mother knows more about their kids than Sherlock Holmes. And if a mother wants an answer to question, she can read an offenders eyes quicker than a homicide detective.  So... considering the value a mother could bring to an inspection team, why are we sending a bunch of old men who will rely on electronic equipment to scout out hidden threats? My mother would walk in with a wooden soup spoon in one hand, grab Saddam by the ear, give it a good twist and snap,"Young man, do you have any weapons of mass destruction?"  And God help him if he tried to lie to her. She'd march him down the street to some secret bunker and shove his nose into a nuclear bomb and say, "Uh, huh, and what do you call this, mister?" Whap! Thump! Whap! Whap! Whap! And she'd lay some stripes across his bare bottom with that soup spoon, then march him home in front of the whole of Baghdad. He'd not only come clean and apologize for lying about it, he'd cut every lawn in Baghdad for free for the whole dang  summer.  Inspectors my foot ... You want the job done?  Call my mother.

       Brought to you by the letter 'Q'    This late late post is being brought to you by the letter "Q."   My daughter Keisha is in pre-Kindergarten, and today, among the many activities, they began learning about the letter Q.  After she came home, she and I went to the bank and the store and we started talking about words that begin with Q.  The phrase "Quit it!" for when you want someone to stop tickling you (ah... a new phrase to use on Dad).  "Queen" begins with Q.  As does the sound a duck makes: "Quack."  Well, that's what they say in English.  It may be different in another language, for all I know.  So, tonight at dinner, Mom, Jennie, Keisha, and I talk about words with Q in them.  Mom points out that we're eating Taquitos, a Mexican food.  She told Keisha, "Taquito has a 'Q' in it!"  Keisha looked at it and adamantly replied, "No, it doesn't!"  Then we all chuckled because we realized that Keisha was looking for the actual letter Q on her taquito.   Thus ends the post that was brought to you by the letter Q.

I, too, was taken; hook, line, and sinker.  I'm just surprised that it ended the way that it did.

First, I hope you will accept our apology for your recent disappointment in McDonald's. I can assure you that we want you to be completely satisfied every time you visit one of our restaurants.  Because most McDonald's restaurants are franchised, I have forwarded your comments to the franchise owner or local representative for follow up at the restaurant. Please be assured that your concerns will be investigated and, if appropriate, corrective action will be taken.  Again, thank you for bringing this matter to our attention and giving us the opportunity to look into your concern.  Melissa McDonald's Customer Satisfaction Department  Update:   Great news!

This year I am aware of many from my graduating class who would like to have our 15th year reunion.  So far, not many have volunteered to organize it.  I wonder how many of you out there have had any experience with organizing a high school reunion.  Now that we have the Internet, it's probably a bit easier, I bet.  I'd love any input you can offer.  Please.  Thanks in advance!   Update:   I've found an  urlLink alumni news page at the high school's website , but I obviously need more!  I also found the page for the  urlLink Mount Healthy City School District .   Update Update:  I'm going to set up (yet another) weblog that's simply devoted to the planning of our reunion.  I'll be able to give others access to it, so that they can provide content.  But which template to choose from?  Anyone have any ideas?

       McAfee Virus Advisory   Do you rely on instant messaging?   Users with Hotmail addresses in MSN Messenger are vulnerable to W32/Nicehello@MM, a MEDIUM RISK mass-mailing worm that emails itself to MSN Messenger contact lists. Worse, it also attempts to send MSN Messenger usernames and passwords to the virus author via an email message. So far, the virus has a limited spread, but has been seen in several languages, including English and Spanish.   What to Look for:     Attachment: When the W32/Nicehello@MM attachment is run, a false Windows XP error message displays and the worm copies itself in several places on the infected computer.

       'McCustomer No-Service' Rant   They say, "We Love to See You Smile," but today they didn't even try.  Today's rant comes courtesy of none other than  urlLink McDonald's .  Specifically, I'm talking about the operation located at  urlLink 4770 N. MAIN ST., DAYTON, OH 45405-5021 , located next to the Blockbuster Video store.  I have had to leave the following  urlLink complaint at their website : You say "We Love to See You Smile."  I must disagree, based on my experience.  All I wanted to do was compare the prices for the soft drinks.  Your menus have gotten so cluttered that the prices and sizes for soft drinks were not listed.  I asked the drive thru attendant what the prices were, and she was most uncooperative.  Downright rude, actually.  She stated that she didn't know.  She did not take any initiative to find out from any management that were present.  The situation deteriorated to the point where I stated, "Thank you for your 'Customer No-Service'.  I'll take my business elsewhere."  I returned minutes later to get complaint information, but that was hard to come by as well.  The drive thru attendants didn't know the information, and they were not very willing to find it out.  I happened to see a crew leader (wearing a light blue shirt) and asked him.  He gave me the information.  I told the attendants, "See?  All you have to do is ask one of your managers.  It's not THAT hard to do, is it?"  It was obvious to me that to McDonald's, I am just another customer number, just a dollar amount.  Shoo me in, and shoo me out.  "We Love to See You Smile" is your slogan.  You didn't make me smile today.    What are you going to do about this?  You may not even do anything about my complaint.  Well, you may find that I don't visit this McDonalds again.  You also may find that my friends won't either, because I have begun to tell my friends about this experience.  And, of course, a business that continues to operate in this manner does not have a big chance of surviving in the long run.  I now leave this in your hands.  Update:  Great news!   urlLink The situation has been remedied !

        urlLink The New Leader    I bought this book while co-oping in Sterling Heights, Michigan in 1991.  I fell in love with the principles of it, but I think I need a refresher.  I'm glad I still have this book, and I'm adding it to my reading list because I need to get some fresh convictions about leadership from Jesus' perspective.  What I found interesting about the book is that it is intended not only for application in a religious circle, but it also can be used within a business context.  I was a little bit surprised to find the Amazon.com link for the book.  One thing to note about this book, and, I suppose any book, for that matter, is the context in which it is written.  My copy is the second printing, which occurred in 1989, so some of the examples used may appear a little (or a lot) dated.  Nevertheless, the principles of leadership that Jesus Christ taught and lived by are  urlLink still relevant today  -- Amen!

       "A Bit of Light Reading"*   I just finished my second reading of   urlLink Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone  , which means that I've now read all of the first four books twice.  I still haven't picked up on all the clues and nuances, so I may wind up rereading them again.  Why am I so interested in this, you might ask?  Well, of course, you may be aware that   urlLink Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix   is coming June 21st.  But also, while at the bookstore a couple weeks ago with Keisha - it was probably on a night that she wasn't going to school because of the snow - I found a rather intriguing book entitled the   urlLink Ultimate Unofficial Guide to the Mysteries of Harry Potter  .   * from page 219 of the hardcover version of   urlLink Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone .

       Leave it to the Dog   While walking our dog Jake this morning, I took him the usual route around the cul de sac in which we live.  Two-thirds of the way around, he stops by a tree and drops something he'd obviously been carrying for longer than the entire walk:  one of Keisha's hearing aids!  This  urlLink hearing aid  sells for a nice price of $1600.  I was so upset, and I disciplined him for it.  Nevertheless, after we'd come back home and I sent him to his bed, I couldn't help but feel a little bit grateful that everything was intact.  It still works, and it just needs to be cleaned before she can use it again.  And, since he actually found it, who knows where it actually was?  Maybe we would have had a hard time finding it.  So I guess I see this as a bit of a blessing in a disguise.  I mean, after all, Jake does have toys that are much less expensive.

       Friends in the Fight for Enduring Freedom   Last Thursday I learned that another of our close friends, who serves in the Army Reserves, will likely be sent out very soon.  We learned this from his wife; they have two kids.  She mentioned that it will likely be a 12-month stint, which means that she will, for all intents and purposes, become a single mom during that time.  I am blessed to receive email rather regularly from another friend, Dave F., who is stationed somewhere in the Atlantic.  In his recent email, he writes: Yesterday we picked up all of our misdirected mail.  There was 7 tons that were sent to the wrong location.  I got one small package that made me very happy.  For everyone it was like a visit from Santa.  A lot of people received and shared  brownies and cookies.  I'm sure they were fresh when they were baked but it took so long that most of it was dry when it got here.  We didn't care one bit though and thought they tasted great.  I guess it was just knowing that they came from home. It's was encouraging to see the sharing.  I am told they are still sorting through the mail.  When I first left I packed a few  urlLink DPI  books, the disciples handbook and the song book. I packed the song book hoping to go to a church service out here.  My song book has stayed in my sea bag through out the whole trip until today. For what ever reason I felt the urge to dig it out today.   People who know me, know I don't sing by myself. I jokingly live by the motto 'The Bible says make a joyful noise so I keep my mouth shut' ;)  There I was with my song book looking over some of my favorite songs and just began singing some of them to myself. For those moments I felt 2 things. I had a strong feeling of peace that was with me and second, I felt like I was standing there with the Body. I can't describe it beyond that but it was great.  I have to go. I thought I would share some of this encouragement with you.  Thank you for the email and most importantly your prayers. They have helped me so much to stay in the fight. I thought we were going to visit a port with disciples but that was changed. That was the reason we had the steel beach BBQ. I would have traded one hour with disciples over the day of recreation. Take care of yourself and I hope to hear from you soon :D

       It Was Just A Dream   Last night I had a dream that I'd been drafted to serve in the US Army.  From what I can still remember about it, I felt scared.  I remember that I had to rush through everything.  Hurry up and eat.  Hurry up and use the bathroom.  Hurry up and shower.  Not much sunshine or light at all, for that matter.  Everything seemed rather dark.  I remember feeling very sad and depressed.

       "For with the measure you use..."    urlLink Roy  has an interesting post from Susanna Cornett about the famous words of Jesus Christ: "Judge not, lest ye be judged."  That's from the King James Version of the Bible.  I added the following comments to his post: I've noticed that people usually just quote the first verse [of Matthew 7].  Jesus continues in verse 2: "For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure that you use, it will be measured to you."  So, if I examine mine and others' lives according to what the Scriptures say, since we'll be judged according to that standard ( urlLink John 12:47-48 ), there is nothing wrong with judging.  I think it's impossible for people not to make judgements.

       Bunny Babies   You might say that the Easter bunny left us a couple of his relatives.  This past Friday morning Jennie spotted two baby rabbits in one of the window wells outside our house.  (For those that don't know what a window well is, I'll explain.  Our basement is below grade, yet we also have some windows to let light in.  Outside our home, surrounding these windows is a semi-circular cutout of the ground around the window, with some metal present to retain the soil.)  At the time we had wondered if the mother rabbit had placed them there for their safety.  Jennie called the local Humane Society and the Natural History Museum for some advice.  The folks at the museum recommended leaving them alone for a few days to see if they get out by themselves.  If, after that time, they are still in the window well, we should get them out ourselves.  So, we had friendly wildlife just outside our home this weekend.  Tonight I went to see how they were doing and to get them out of the window well.  Alas, one of the rabbits had died.  I purloined my daughter's butterfly net and pulled both of them out.  The dead rabbit I threw into our garbage can, to be taken to the landfill with our other trash tomorrow morning.  The live one I placed in our yard at about five feet away from the window well.  About an hour later, I went back outside to check on the little guy.  He was gone.

       It's Scary Down There!   One thing I am definitely afraid of, to the point where I dread having to deal with it myself -- so much so that I shudder -- is looking for something in my wife's purse.  It's like a black hole down there!  There have been some times that I have mistakenly, and with immediate regret, forgotten this and have gone searching for something inside there.  Usually I've been looking for something, and my wife tells me that it's in her purse.  How badly I want whatever it is that I'm looking for is in direct proportion to the level of effort I take in looking inside my wife's purse.  And the extent.  For example, I remember dumping my wife's purse out when somebody came to our house to get their car keys back.   urlLink Jennie  was not happy about that.  As if there was some sort of order to it anyway! (just kidding, honey!)  Tonight when she was going through her purse she found a vital part to Keisha's FM system:  the receivers, which attach to her  urlLink hearing aids .  For those who don't know what I'm talking about, I'll provide a brief explanation.  By wearing hearing aids, Keisha gets amplified sounds, targeted to the specific type of hearing loss she has.  With this setup, however, she hears not only sounds she wants to hear, but also other environmental sounds as well.  Have you ever hooked up headphones to a tape recorder and listened while you record?  You hear not only what you're trying to record, but the sound of the refrigerator, feet squeaking on the floor, and so on.  The  urlLink FM system  provides a way for Keisha to hear sounds specifically targeted to her.  When we wear it, and she has the receivers on her hearing aids, she can hear us better over the other sounds.  It's been months since we've used the FM system, and I'm glad Jennie was the one to go through her purse to find them.  Now, if we can only find my keys.

       Her First Lost Tooth   While getting ready for a morning bath, Keisha noticed that her front right tooth, which had been really loose lately, came out last night while she slept.  She was so excited!  This tooth is the first one she's lost.  Apparently it got mixed up in her bed clothes.  We'll have to look for it.  We told her that the Tooth Fairy will make a visit tonight as she sleeps.  Now she can't wait to show all her friends.

'Who do you say I am?'" -  urlLink Jesus Christ   I'm reproducing my comments here: Ooh... what a good post! It reminds me of a song we sometimes sing in church, called "Jesus is my Best Friend." It goes like this: My best friend Jesus is my best friend (repeat) I am not alone (repeat) My best friend Jesus is my best friend (repeat) I am not alone For subsequent verses, substitute something else for "my best friend." Finally, end the song with doing the verse with "my best friend" again.

"We're trying to educate as many people as we can so nobody has to go through what we had to go through," said Bernie Sherwood, organizer of the "Colossal Colon" exhibit, which is part of the National Cancer Education Tour.  Bernie's daughter, Amanda Sherwood Roberts, died of colon cancer last year.  The exhibit was created in her honor.  "The 'Colossal Colon' is designed for children and adults to crawl through, and allows visitors to see different stages of the disease, from polyps to full-blown cancer."

       It May Be The Cowboy In Me    The urge to run the restlessness The heart of stone I sometimes get The face that's in the mirror When I don't like what I see I guess that's just the cowboy in me. --  from "The Cowboy In Me", recorded by Tim McGraw   I bring this up because, as I look at the templates for my blogs, I'm beginning to feel restless.  I'm at the point in my blog history where I'm feeling the need to update my blog templates.  Throughout its 15-month history, this blog has undergone many template revisions.  I'm just thinking that it may be time to put a "fresh coat of paint" on this one and the others as well.  Well, except for the ones that are the most recent.  By the way, when was the last time you checked them out?  Here they are, with a brief description as to what they are about:   urlLink Journey Inside My Mind : You're reading it right now -- but you knew that already.  urlLink QuotesBlog : growing wiser on the wisdome (and stupidity) of others - a quotation junkie's collection  urlLink Letters to God : personal, albeit one-sided communication between me and God.  urlLink Streams of Consciousness : fun stuff emanating from my brain and heart  urlLink Get That Job! : job hunting and career development resource  urlLink Class of 1988 Reunion Information : Mt. Healthy High School Class of 1988 Reunion Information  urlLink Me, Myself, and I : okay not mine, but my mom's - check it out and let her know you stopped by! So, there you have it.  My shameless blog-plug.  I don't think that there will be another one like this.  For a little while.  Bet you're glad.

       Friday 5   This is my first time doing this, so bear with me.  I'll try to "shoot from the hip" as I answer these. (Examines questions.)  Oh crud.  I guess I'll have to think about the answers after all.  Shall we?   1.  Who is your favorite celebrity?   I don't have one.   2.  Who is your least favorite?   Any of the myriad  urlLink nitwit Hollywood-types  who have demonstrated their idiocy and anti-Americanism.   3.  Have you ever met or seen any celebrites in real life?   I met Nick Clooney, George Clooney's dad, over 20 years ago.  At the time he was an anchorman for a local Cincinnati television station.  I also met Kent Voss, who at one time hosted the late-afternoon talk show on News-Talk 1290 WHIO here in Dayton.   4.  Would you want to be famous?  Why or why not?   I  am  famous.  Just ask my daughter.   5.  If you had to trade places with a celebrity for a day, who would you choose and why?   David Letterman.  I think I'd just love to guest-host his show.

       On This Day I Complete My 33rd Year   I'm reminded of a poem by Lord Byron entitled "On This Day I Complete My 36th Year."  I remember that he was quite morose, as though he thought he was nearing the end of his life.  I don't feel like that at all.  I remember joking with my high school English teacher, in whose class we read this poem, because she turned 36 that year as well.  Anyhow, I'd like to thank God Almighty for creating me.  My parents, Daniel Sr. and Margaret, for producing me.  I'd like to thank my brothers and sisters, step-brothers and step-sisters, step-parents past and present.  I'd like to thank friends and family for all their contributions to my life.  I am happy to be alive!  Whoo Hoo!

       Stranger -- Strange, Indeed      urlLink FNIS Market Intelligence    I just spoke with someone representing this company who came to our property to anonymously (covertly?) get information about our house.  I spotted this individual in a car that was stopped across the street from our house.  We live in a cul de sac, so it's pretty easy to spot strangers in the area.  Sensitive as I've been ever since we had our car and house burglarized, I approached this individual.  This individual was hired to collect some information about a house on our street.  "Which one?" I asked.  This person pointed to our house, a bit reluctantly.  "All I can say is that I'm collecting some information that will ultimately be given to someone with whom you're related to financially," this individual said.  "What kind of information?" I asked.  "Just an updated picture, among other things."  "To verify that the property is being occupied, for example," I added.  I took the dog for a walk, as this individual drove to the end of our cul de sac, turned around, parked for a little while, and then began to head out.  I approached the vehicle and asked this individual, "How does someone get a job like yours?  Seriously.  I'm unemployed and looking for work."  "Well, I don't know.  I'm doing this leg work for my parents.  I don't know if you have to be a realtor or something like that.  Maybe you could check out the website.  I don't have it here with me," this individual replied.  "Yes, you do," I corrected.  "It's on the paper you're working from."  This individual didn't notice that I'd examined his paper from before, I guess.  The individual showed me the sheet, and that is how I got the domain name.  "Yeah," the individual said, "I guess you could check things out there."  "Will do," I answered.  Interesting...

       April 15th   It's the day before my birthday, but I'm not very excited.  Yet.  That's because I'm doing our taxes, which are due by midnight tonight.  I couldn't pass up the trip to the downtown post office, I suppose.  That, or I'm just a procrastinator.  I recognize that procrastination is something I need to work on in my character, but I think I'll work on it some other time.  I just read that  urlLink Dave Barry  almost waited to the last moment, too.  Hence, don't expect much blogging activity today.  Read through previous days' posts, or, if you live in Ohio, specifically the southwestern part, go outside and enjoy the nice weather today.  By the way, we should change Election Day to today.  I wonder how many people would still be in office.  Like  urlLink Tom "Puff" Daschle , for example.

       That's What Happens When It's Spring!   This afternoon I noticed that the tulips we never planted are popping up in various parts of our yard, and they are in bloom.  In the morning the sun shines on the front of our house, and I noticed that the bulbs have bent to face the sun.  In the afternoon, the sun shines mostly in the backyard, and the bulbs back there have bent toward the sun.  Keisha and I, after picking up Jennie from her last day of  urlLink Nurse's Aide training , took our dog Jake to a local park to play.  We spent time on the swings, kicking a ball around on the tennis court, going down the slide.  My favorite part of it was when she was chasing me around the playground.  After we walked home, I started up the grill, since Jennie was getting some chicken ready.  While waiting for dinner to get ready, I brought out the lawn mower and cut the grass in the front and backyard for the first time this year, getting my new white gym shoes green around the bottom.  I then noticed that the flowers had closed back up for the evening.  I bet they'll open up tomorrow when the sun shines again.

       Garage Door Battle   I had to go to battle with our garage door opener this evening.  Something had happened to it, and it wasn't behaving properly.  So, after dinner, I climbed onto our car and noticed that a vital wire was torn apart.  So I put the wire back together and retested the mechanism.  After a few bouts of trial and error, I had fixed it.  I also noticed that the garage door opener had room for light bulbs, so I installed them.  I win.

       Pay the Man   We just got a visit from a representative from our local energy delivery supplier.  He was authorized to shut off our service unless we gave him a certain amount of money.  So, after bloodletting a check, he went on his way.  I hope the check clears.  I was just thinking... I don't think I have good enough credit to get a PayPal account, so I guess I can't solicit donations that way.  Hmm.

       License and Registration, Please   On Saturday, Keisha and I took Jennie to her English class at  urlLink Sinclair Community College .  After that, we took a drive to the  urlLink Ohio E-check station .  As we were pulling in, I noticed the fee was $19.50 and looked at Keisha and remarked, "Hey, I don't have any money?  Do  you  have any money?" :D  So, we drove home to get the checkbook.  Keisha had to get her  urlLink Barbie  dolls.  As we reconvened our journey, I glanced at Keisha and noticed that her dolls were  naked .  "Hey, Keisha!  Your dolls don't have any clothes on!"  "I have them right here," she replied, reaching into her coat pocket.  Later as we returned to the Ohio E-check station, I looked over at her, and she showed me that all the dolls now had their clothes on.  Which was a  good  thing.  I explained, in my best 5-year old language that I could, what the folks at the E-check station were going to do.  Then we got to watch.  Fortunately, our 1997 Honda Civic passed the emissions test, and, after bloodletting the $19.50 we took our certificate and headed for the  urlLink Bureau of Motor Vehicles(BMV)  so that I could get my driver's license and our car's registration renewed.  (In Ohio, you have to get these things done by your birthday.  Mine is April 16th.   urlLink Some of you  may have already figured that out from my username.)  I told Keisha that I was going to get my picture taken and that we were going to get a sticker for our car.  She thought that was going to be cool.  We walked inside and pulled a number from the "Take a Number" machine (for lack of a better description).  I asked Keisha to confirm the number: "B09."  We sat down on one of the benches and waited, as the employees of the BMV called out numbers.  "Daddy, wanna play Barbies?" Keisha asked.  "No, sweetheart, I don't.  Thank you, though.  You really should bring the Ken doll if you want me to play," I replied.  Keisha played by herself and looked around.  She saw an obese man across the room and told me about it.  "That man has a big belly, Daddy," she said.  "Yeah, well, people come in all sizes and types, sweetheart," I said.  "Some people are big; others are little.  Some people are young, and others are old."  "Like those people," she said looking across the aisle from us at the gray-haired couple.  "Yes, like those people," I said.    Finally, someone from the BMV called out, "Number 9!"  I got up and went to the counter, handing over my driver's license and registration info.  "We need to do an eye exam, and we'll need you to remove your glasses first."  "But I can't see anything without them," I protested.  "Let's try it without them first, and then we'll try it with them on," the lady said.  After asking me to read a certain line, I told her that all I saw was a blur.  So she let me use my glasses.  I passed the eye exam and went on to get my picture taken.  Next to the place where you sit are some comic strips about getting your driver's license picture taken and a mirror.  I sat down and smiled.  She took my picture.  Moments later, after I had certified that I have insurance and no medical condition that would keep me from piloting the space shuttle, it was time to pay the fee.  I made out a check to "State of Ohio BMV" for $50 (:-O more bloodletting).  I then asked the lady if she'd need to see my driver's license, since I was writing a check.  "No, we know how to find you if there's a problem."  Comforting.  Indeed.  After telling Keisha that she couldn't get  her  picture taken and to stay away from the eye exam machine, the lady handed me my new driver's license and registration information.  Keisha and I walked back to the car, and I affixed the new sticker to our license plate.  All this done 11 days early!  That's different for me.  Now... where is that  tax information ?

        urlLink Forbes.com | Yahoo! Searches For Lost Glory    "NEW YORK - They both have silly names, were started by Stanford University graduate students and have become partners, but there is apparently some unease in the relationship between  Yahoo!  and  Google --so Yahoo!, whose history dates back to 1994, is redesigning its search engine in a bid to compete with Google, the reigning king of searches that began in 1998."  What say you on this?  I tend to think that more competition will mean better service.

       Another Email from the Gulf...   I've received another email from a good friend serving not only in the US Navy in Operation Iraqi Freedom, but also most importantly God Almighty.  He writes: Hey, Hey!!  How is everything for you back there?  Things were a little rough for me the past couple weeks but I'm praying and working through it.  There have been a lot of rumors going around as to when we might come home.  During the Captain's inspection of our department she was asked to clarify the rumor for us. She did not give us a date but did tell us which rumor was closest.  Sorry, I'm not at liberty to mention even that right now.  We still have not seen port yet. That is frustrating. We thought we were going to very soon but that too looks like it won't happen for us. Yesterday most of of ship had a day off. There was a volleyball tournament in the hanger bay. It would have been a safe place had they not left the hanger bay doors open. We heard "Willlsonnn!!!" (from Tom Hank's movie  urlLink  Cast Away  ) called out over the ship's intercom (we call it the 1MC) as we watched the volleyball go sailing through the hanger bay doors. Alas the SAR (Search And Resue) Swimmers were unavailable for the rescue. I hope that's not the case if we lose one of us ;) Maybe the ball will make it ashore and some kids will be able to enjoy it.  About your prayer for the war. I do not claim to know the heart of God or his mind, but this is my view on the war so far. I know many of you have been praying for a swift victory and few casualties. As in the days of the Old Testament, when God threw our enemies into confusion, he has seemed to protect us again. Yes we have had casualties but they have been very few compared to what could have been. We are finding Iraqi armor completely abandoned. We have literally captured groups of soldiers as they sleep (in the day time) and we took the Bagdad airport by surprise and with little resistance.  Even the Iraqi casualties, though large, could be even greater than they are. Through all of this many of their civilians have expressed great gratitude upon our arrival. The Iraqis do want liberation. They will probably want to hold on to their muslim beliefs but this liberation and freedom will make it easier for disciples [of Jesus Christ] to go in. This appears to be a ripe time for God to harvest. I'm just trying to offer some perspective on my view of the war. I hope this helps to build your faith in your prayers for the outcome of this.  Remember, as much you think about us over here, we are thinking about you back home :)  YBiC [Your Brother in Christ],  Dave

       Bedtime Routines   Preschoolers need 10 to 12 hours of sleep.  Adequate sleep may increase learning ability, decrease accidents and improve behavior.  Many distractions frequently cause bedtime to become a nightly battle.  TV, video games, unfinished homework, etc., all interfere with bedtime.  Establishing a bedtime routine that is used nightly including weekends and holidays is helpful.  Some tips from the National Institute of Health include  Set a regular bedtime AND stick to it Establish a relaxing routine, such as reading a book or taking a warm bath Make after-dinner playtime relaxing Avoid eating a big meal close to bedtime, but do include a healthy snack before toothbrushing, especially if dinner is early A dark room is best but your child may do better with a soft nightlight The bedroom temperature should be at a comfortable level Making the decision to set an early bedtime for your young child and enforcing it has benefits.  First, it is part of establishing a schedule to help your child to be prepared for what comes next.  One of the biggest benefits may be  your  well-earned adult time to renew your mind and spirit at the end of a long day.

I would definitely get a second opinion, would this help her out more than a hearing aid?  We will definitley be praying for you guys, and if you need anything let us know.  I hope through this time, you guys can remember God's sovereignty, and he is there to comfort us ( urlLink 2 Cor 1 ).  I definitley have been encouraged myself by your guys example and your spirit.

       This is not a love song   Hi.  It seems that lately I've posted with a bit of a sense of humor, irregardless of what the subject is.  This might not be one of those kind of posts.  I'm feeling a bit down right now, to tell you the truth.  I'm close to tears.  Before I explain, I'll admit that, based on the tone of previous posts, it may be hard to take seriously.  Some who read it may laugh or think it's funny.  It may be parodied, even by me someday, I suppose.  I accept that.  I'm still willing to make myself vulnerable.  This is still a Journey Inside My Mind.  I may often, through my writing here, give an impression that I have it all together, that all is well with me emotionally, physically, spiritually, etc.  Well, that's not really the case.  I am dependent on medicine for my mental health.  I'm currently taking an antidepressant, Lexapro, and an anti-anxiety medicine, generically called Diazepam.  I struggle with depression and anxiety, you see.  Furthermore, I've written before about my struggles with self-injury.  That is exactly what it sounds like.  Many people don't know how to relate with someone who self-injures.  Even seeing the words, I feel a slight sense of alarm myself.  Yet it's true.  I create scabs on my body and pick at them to relieve anxiety I feel.  I've done some research, and I realize that it's a way I've developed to cope with stress I feel.  I know it sounds counterproductive, but it makes sense, from a certain point of view.  I get a "rush" from the pain felt from picking at a scab.  The pain associated with that activity is better to feel than emotional pain I feel from something else.  I've done this since I was about 7 years old.  I'm 33 now.  I currently have four scabs on my scalp.  I feel their tenderness as I type these words.  I've been able to leave them alone nearly all day, thankfully.  So I have that to deal with.  Then, today, it appears that I've developed another migraine.  I took my last Imitrex a few hours ago, and I've put a call into my doctor for a refill.  I have to wait until 6 PM to see if someone actually called it into the pharmacy.  Because it's a Saturday afternoon, I'm thinking that it might not be called in until Monday.  I'm hoping that's not the case, but, at the same time, I'm trying to be prepared to accept it, if it turns out to be the case.  I've already spent a few extra hours in bed, and I'm ready to head back there in a little while.  I doubt if anyone really enjoys feeling sick.  I sure don't.  Tears are welling in my eyes right now.  I just hope things feel better soon.  Until then...

       She Couldn't Stay Away   Well, something like that.  Yesterday I gave Keisha's teacher, Jean W., our home phone number and encouraged her to keep in touch with us.  We got a call from Keisha's teacher this afternoon.  She said, "I bet you weren't expecting me to be contacting you so soon."  It turned out that we needed to give her the original copy of some documentation related to Keisha's Individualized Education Plan (IEP).  I gave her directions to our place, and she stopped by.  Keisha was excited about having her favorite teacher see where she lives.  I had gone to pick Jennie up from work, so Jean chatted with my mom and Keisha on our front porch.  She was still there when Jennie and I came home.  I took Keisha's picture with Jean, and Jean gave Keisha her home telephone number because Keisha wants to have her come to her birthday party this July.  How cool, huh?

       The Show Must Go On   I just returned from taking Jennie to work.  While waiting for the traffic signal to change, I began to hear Pink Floyd's "The Show Must Go On" in my mind.  This song is the very first song on their classic album " urlLink The Wall ".  Why it popped into my head at that moment, I have no idea, but it was nevertheless a pleasant diversion to waiting in traffic.

       Sigh   Today is Keisha's last day of school.  In fact, I'll be heading to pick her up in a few minutes.  We've absolutely loved the experience we've had with her teachers.  It feels a little sad.  I don't know how school teachers do it.  I spoke with her teacher this morning, and she said that she was up three times last night crying.  She's been a teacher for 35 years, and it never has gotten easier.  It reminds me of one of my all-time favorite movies, which we saw again last night:  urlLink Mr. Holland's Opus .  I think  urlLink Richard Dreyfuss  should have won Best Actor for his role as Mr. Holland.  That this is one of my favorites shows my inclination to become a teacher, too.  But first, today I have an appointment with the manager of the local professional bartending school.

       Beachstock Reflections    My friend and brother in Christ, Bill T., and a small group of other singles from the Dayton church of Christ in Dayton, Ohio, went to a singles event in Virginia Beach over the weekend entitled "Beachstock."  One of the singles happened to be the mother of  urlLink the two girls we had over the weekend .  Bill emailed me his thoughts from the trip:  Dan,  The trip was awesome! We had 5 people packed into a Dodge Neon... cozy, but fun.  It was supposed to rain all weekend, but God heard the prayers.  Saturday, there wasn't a cloud in the sky, and it didn't rain Sunday either.  It was really nice to get away and hang with some old friends. I also met some neat brothers from Charlotte, North Carolina, that weren't in the church there when I was living in the Queen City  [note from Dan: I think he's referring to Charlotte, although I've most often heard of Cincinnati, Ohio referred to as the Queen City!] .  Our group was blown away. That was the first time they had been to any conference outside of Ohio. They finally got to see a glimpse of what I had been telling them the God's church is really like. My old church where I was converted (Charlotte) had 60 people attend. Wow! Our group was impressed by that alone. There were nearly 500 disciples there. It was amazing.  The trip has motivated us (especially me) to stop waiting for someone else to plan activities for us as the singles group. We are talking about having a "movie night" every month and planning on doing a different activity every month on top of that. We need to be creative, and for the longest time, we haven't really had anything going on.  Nothing to invite people to except for church.  Nevertheless, it was a great impactful time in so many ways. We have a plan, bro... something about momentum that is infectious.  We had 5 people go this year to Beachstock.  My personal goal for next year is 33.  I don't know how it will happen, but God works in ways I can never comprehend. I just hope He doesn't expect us to cram 33 people in a Dodge Neon. That would be like clowns going to the circus.

       Support    via email from my friend and brother Bill T.  I think the only reason why I'm posting this here is because it's so ridiculous.   Take a minute to enjoy a laugh...  ... for little Billy Evans.  I am a very sick little boy. My mother is typing this for me, because I can't. She is crying. Don't cry, Mommy! Mommy is always sad, but she says it's not my fault. I asked her if it was God's fault, but she didn't answer and only started crying harder, so I don't ask her that anymore. The reason she is so sad is because I'm so sick. I was born without a body. It doesn't hurt, except when I try to breathe. The doctors gave me an artificial body.  It is a burlap bag filled with leaves. The doctors said that was the best they could do on account of us having no money or insurance. I would like to have a body transplant, but we need more money. Mommy doesn't work because she said nobody hires crying people.  I said, "Don't cry, Mommy," and she hugged my burlap bag. Mommy always gives me hugs, even though she's allergic to burlap and it makes her sneeze and chafes her real bad. I hope you will help me. You can help me if you forward this email to everyone you know. Forward it to people you don't know, too. Dr. Johansen said that for every person you forward this email to, Bill Gates will team up with AOL and send a nickel to NASA. With that funding, NASA will collect prayers from school children all over America and have the astronauts take them up into space so that the angels can hear them better. Then they will come back to earth and go to the Pope, and he will take up a collection in church and send all the money to the doctors.  The doctors could help me get better then.  Maybe one day I will be able to play baseball. Right now I can only be third base.  Every time you forward this letter, the astronauts can take another prayer to the angels and my dream will be closer to coming true. Please help me.  Mommy is so sad, and I want a body. I don't want my leaves to rot before I turn 10.  If you don't forward this email, that's okay. Mommy says you're mean and heartless. One who doesn't care about a poor little boy with only a head.  She says that if you don't stew in the raw pit of your own guilt-ridden stomach, she hopes you die a long, slow, horrible death and then burn forever in hell. What kind of cruel person are you that you can't take five freakin' minutes to forward this to all your friends so that they can feel guilt and shame about ignoring a poor, bodiless nine-year-old boy?  Please help me. I try to be happy, but it's hard. I wish I had a kitty.  I wish I could hold a kitty. I wish I could hold a kitty that wouldn't chew on me and try to bury its poop in the leaves of my burlap body. I wish that very much.  Thank You, Billy "Smiles" Evans (the boy with just a head, and a burlap sack for a body)

        urlLink Blogger  Template Woes: Strange AND Confusing    urlLink Last week , I changed the template for this blog.  As you may recall, I had to completely redo it.  This meant rerunning it through the  urlLink Blogmatrix Template Rewriter  again.  Once I did all of this, I noticed, after a few days, that the RSS feeds were not being generated/updated.  I've realized that I had added some formatting to the metadata tags that the Template Rewriter added, and this formatting may be what is causing the problems with the RSS feed.  So last night I removed the extra formatting and republished the blog.  I just returned to the template HTML that is stored on  urlLink Blogger , only to find that the previous template -- with the old layout -- is present!  Fortunately, I saved a copy of my new template in case I needed to revise it or, in this case republish it.  But, when I copy, paste, save, republish, and return to check it, guess what?  The old template is still there!  It's as though  urlLink Blogger  is not saving my changes.   Update:   Maybe  urlLink the recent hardware failure  is to blame.

       Road Trip!   Today my lovely wife Jennie, our daughter Keisha, and her two friends Hailie and Stevie -- we all travelled to Columbus, Ohio for the day.  We had an all-Ohio church service along the banks of the Scioto River, at Genoa Park.  This location also was adjacent to  urlLink COSI .  The service itself was great.  Doug Jacoby preached a sermon about the Seven Unities of the Faith, based on what we read in  urlLink Ephesians 4 .  The main point was this:  if we don't know what we are about as a church, then we're in big trouble.  After the service, we went to COSI.  Our membership at  urlLink Dayton's Boonshoft Museum of Discovery  is reciprocated at the Columbus COSI, so we didn't have to pay any admission fee.  We then proceeded to the Atomic Cafe for some lunch.  After lunch we headed toward the exhibits.  It was all Jennie and I could do to keep up with the girls, who are collectively between the ages of 4 and 6.  Between the frequent potty breaks -- all the girls had to go with Jennie, and I went alone to the men's room -- and trying to keep our eyes on them as they experienced each of the various stations at the exhibits, Jennie and I got worn out.  We went to this one exhibit entitled  urlLink Crashendo , in which we rode in a vehicle and watched a movie that simulated us riding behind a man who was "driving" a piano.  It was hilarious!  You had to have been there.  Like the  urlLink COSI in Toledo , it has a cycle ride across a wire.  The difference is that Columbus has a unicycle whereas Toledo has a bicycle.  I got to ride it, and I must have looked so brave to my daughter and her friends!  We also toured the Planetarium, in which there was a program about what we're seeing in the  urlLink Springtime night sky .  That was pretty cool.  Outside Keisha and Stevie went on a  urlLink Centripetal Generotor ride .  As we stood against the wall, the machine spun around at 17 miles per hour.  Inertia and friction kept us pinned to the wall, even as the floor dropped two feet.  It felt like an elephant was sitting on me.  Then, as the ride slowed down, we all slid the two feet back to the floor.  Stevie and Keisha, myself, too, enjoyed the ride so much that we returned three more times!  Jennie and Hailie didn't want to ride it.  They opted instead to play with the  urlLink Big Giant Lever , in which they attempted to lift an automobile with a level.  There were so many other exhibit stuff, and I'll have to post about it another time.  Jennie and I learned that we probably could have gone to the  urlLink little Kidspace  and stayed there.  It was the last exhibit we attended, however.  On the way home we stopped at the  urlLink Waffle House  for dinner.  I had their hashbrowns ("Scattered, Smothered, etc."), Stevie had a grilled cheese sandwich, Keisha had her cheeseburger, and Jennie and Hailie had breakfast.  We sat in the five seats at their bar.  The girls were really impressed as they saw the kitchen area.  Keisha told one of the servers that she thought it was cool.  We later talked about having our home kitchen set up like theirs.  Keisha decided that she would man the drinks and the toasters.  Learn more about the Waffle House story and some interesting Waffle House facts  urlLink here .  It's interesting to see how these kids can behave like siblings.  Granted, Halie and Stevie  are  sisters.  But for Keisha and the rest of us, it creates a great dynamic.  For four days Keisha has two sisters living with her whereas she normally is the only child.  The adults in our household are realizing how much we appreciate how quieter the house is.  I love these two extra girls as though they are my own, and we have really enjoyed having them with us.

        urlLink Dayton to Host All of A-10 Tournament in 2004    For the 2003 Atlantic 10 college basketball championship, the University of Dayton hosted eight of the 12 teams.  This effort brought in more than a million dollars to the Miami Valley.  Next year, all the teams will play in Dayton, which is sure to give the Dayton area a big economic boost.  For those of us living in Dayton, we know to expect the extra congestion around Interstate 75 and the Edwin C. Moses Blvd. exit.  Also, we'll want to stay away from Stewart Street.  Well, we have until next spring to really be concerned about it.

       Living in the Estrogen Ocean   This weekend we have two extra girls staying with us.  They are 6 and 5 years old.  Our daughter Keisha is almost 6 years old.  In one sense, it's great that they are all so close in age.  In another, it's like having three of Keisha in the home.  They all three behave just like they're sisters.  Well, Hailie and Stevie  are  sisters, but Keisha gets in there and mixes it up with them just fine.  Thursday night was the first night they spent the night.  Keisha, being an only child, is not used to having other kids here.  The other girls needed to get used to being at our house as well.  Nevertheless, we needed them to get to bed because Hailie had school on Friday.  They didn't settle down that easily, and, as a result I had to bring out Mr. Justice.  Mr. Justice is the name we've given to a ping pong paddle that we use to spank.  After a few sessions of administering Mr. Justice, the girls finally understood that we were serious about them getting to bed.  I don't know whether Hailie and Stevie's mother spanks them that often, but, when they received Mr. Justice from me, I could tell there was a little bit of shock.  I had to tell them it was okay to cry, and they did.  Another reason why it's good to have the girls over is that Keisha gets to play and watch her "girly" movies (like "Life-Size", "Snow White", and so on) with her friends.  I, being the only human male, tend to want to take our male dog and go camping or something like that.  For now, I'll settle for the online experience.  Lord, please help me to have patience, and soon!

       Template Wackiness   Okay.  Well, at least I'm back to publishing new stuff.  I've got the bare bones template now.  I'll be making some changes, and hopefully it will be the way I really want it.  Of course, in a short while there will be a new version of Blogger and I might have to change things around again.  We'll see.

        urlLink When the Spam Hits the Blogs    Wired News reports that many bloggers "have recently noticed that their referrer logs have become the newest target for spam."  The logs are being stuffed with bogus links that lead to pornographic or advertising sites.    One side effect of this practice is that many bloggers' sites increase in their page rank in search engines.  Nevertheless, be careful out there.

        urlLink The Matrix: Reloaded    Jennie and I saw the movie yesterday.  I loved it.  This is the kind of movie that I might even see again in the theater.  Given today's movie ticket prices, that's saying a lot.  I waited through all the credits and was treated to a preview of The Matrix: Revolutions at the end.  I don't know whether  urlLink Mike over at _monk  has seen it yet, but it sounds like the kind of movie he would really dig, especially with the philosophical stuff.  The cliffhanger ending is quite reminiscient of what he and I have seen in ' urlLink Alias ', too.  Be sure to set aside three good hours to sit through the film.  One couple who waited with us wound up not seeing the movie because they were previously unaware that the movie would be that long.  I get nothing from this except for a nice, warm feeling of helping my fellow moviegoers:   urlLink Purchase your tickets to the movie online at MovieTickets.com

       Dayton, Ohio USA: The Place to Be in 2003   Big things are happening in my city this year.  First, we have the  urlLink 200th anniversary of Ohio's statehood .  Secondly, we have the  urlLink 100th anniversary of the Wright brothers' first airplane flight .  This past weekend was  urlLink Hamvention , an annual convention of HAM radio operators and the like.  Each July the  urlLink Dayton Air Show  is always a big draw.  It's going to be huge this year!  Moreover, the Dayton, Ohio area hosts one of the busiest interchanges in the country.  We have Interstate 75, which extends north up through Michigan and south down through Florida.  Also, we have Interstate 70, which extends west to Colorado and east to Maryland.  Let's just say it's a vital interchange to the country.  Its cloverleaf design has been outdated for quite some time, however.  In fact, it's been quite hazardous, given the volume of traffic now flowing through it.  This interchange is being reconstructed, and the Ohio Department of Transportation has an official website for the project:  urlLink I-70/I-75 Interchange Project Information .  The site includes lots of neat links to before and after pictures, construction maps, project schedules, and the like.

       Sick as a Dog   Jake, our labrador/collie puppy is sick.  Yesterday, since we noticed that he'd had a couple of accidents in the house, we put him in his cage and closed the door.  Then, throughout the night we heard him vomiting in his cage.  I tried and was able to sleep despite the "characteristic" sounds coming from his cage.  Then, early this morning, Jennie, my wife/better half, let him out of his cage and let him go outside.  My job is to clean the cage.  Basically that just means laundering the blankets and washing the cage.  Fortunately for me, there's not much to it.  So, we'll be monitoring him today.  We have some NutriCal, which is a nutrient gel that we can feed him.  I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't eat much today.  Poor guy.

       The Week of the Migraine   It's coming to an end.  Actually, I've been feeling much better for the past few days.  So let's pray this thing goes away and doesn't come back for a long time.  If at all.  On a different note, I will be speaking in front of church tomorrow.  Our evangelist emailed me earlier in the week, asking me to do communion.  What that means is that I'm going to spend a little bit of time talking about Jesus Christ, the crucifixion, the resurrection, etc., with a personal emphasis.  I believe that communion is the most important reason why we come together for worship.  I've been mulling some things in my mind, and I believe I've got it down - what I'm going to talk about, anyway.  I might post more about it tomorrow after I've done it.

        urlLink Miracle Migraine Medicine    I got my prescription for  urlLink Imitrex  filled yesterday.  I've had this murderous headache since Sunday afternoon.  I followed the doc's orders and took the pills: 1 every hour for four hours.  I was feeling it.  I almost fell asleep face down on the living room couch before Jennie urged me to head to bed.  After I took my other medicine, I went to bed and slept like a baby.  I'm still feeling drowsy, but for the most part, the migraine seems to be gone.  Hallelujah!

       I Said, "Doctor!  Mr. MD!"   "Won't you please tell me what's ailin' me?"  (from the song "Good Lovin'")  Day 3 of the headache from Hell.  I went to the doctor this afternoon, and he did something I did not expect.  After having me lie down on the bench, he nudged my neck a few times.  I felt a couple cracks and just laughed.  "That's it?" I asked incredulously.  He gave me a sample and a prescription for  urlLink Imitrex .  So I've got this migraine that at time feels like a sledgehammer is being driven into my head.  Actually, that might feel a little better.  By the way, folks, in case you're wondering, yesterday I spent nearly ALL day and night sleeping.  I didn't even have an appetite for dinner.  I've heard of diets, but I think I'd prefer a different kind.  I think that's all for now, and I'll be off to bed shortly.

       Sinuses, allergies, or was it too much Mother's Day?   Hi.  I'm not feeling too good today.  I think it actually started yesterday afternoon.  We came home from church and I laid down on the couch for a nap.  A few hours later I awoke with a splitting headache, where the upper left-hand corner of my left eye was the epicenter.  I made my way downstairs and took a Sinus/Allergy pill and laid down on our bed.  I reawoke at 4:30 PM to take  urlLink my mom  and  urlLink Jennie  to dinner for Mother's Day ( urlLink I actually alluded that something like this would happen late last week. ).  We initially tried to get into  urlLink Golden Corral  to take advantage of their All-You-Can-Eat Steak Buffet, but, alas, there were lines extending outside that showed how busy the restaurant was.  We decided instead to go to  urlLink Skyline Chili .  My mom, who grew up in Cincinnati, the birthplace of Skyline Chili, did not have it available to her as much when she lived in Texas.  Yet another good reason for her to move back to Ohio. :D  I barely had any appetite, but I somehow managed to eat a small 3-way and a cheese coney.  I guess there are some things that even sickness can't overcome, huh?  I went home took all my medicine and went to bed.  This was at about 6:30 PM last night.  I woke up this morning, and I felt a little better... until I coughed.  So I just took another dose of the sinus/allergy medicine, and I'm going to head back to bed for a little while.  The hot shower didn't seem to help a whole lot.  Except, maybe, that I feel sick and smell clean and fresh at the same time!

       They sent us to our basement   This afternoon it rained hard.  We had a big thunderstorm come through.  I was brought to my senses when I heard the hail hitting our roof and looked out the window to see it streaming across the yard.  I walked to our covered porch to see how big the hail was.  At one point, I picked up a golf ball-sized piece.  Of course at that time, the local weathermen told us we needed to get to our basements because they had noticed some rotation in the cloud system, even though no funnels were created.  Just to be safe.  So we all went downstairs and sat on our bed and watched the progress of the thunderstorm on the local television station.  When it looked and sounded like the worst had passed I walked upstairs and outside to survey the area.  I called for everyone else to come up, too.  We saw lots of hail strewn around our yard, and it appears that the hood of mom's car was pelted with hail.  Other than that, everything looked okay.  Keisha walked around the yard, collecting pieces of hail in a plastic cup.  Then we all returned inside to the rest of our lives.

       His Royal Jakeness   For the past week, Jake and I have been getting some good exercise.  Almost every day this week we've gone for an hour-long walk around the neighborhood.  Today we did it after the huge rain storm, so we got kinda wet from walking in the puddles.  It's amazing that he can urinate in so many places; I wonder how he does it.  Does he have a second bladder?  I've also learned that I have to carry three plastic bags when we go on this walk.  When we came home, I knew that Jake needed a bath.  So Keisha and I got into our swimming suits and gave him a bath outside on our driveway.  He initially resisted the ordeal but gradually let what had to be done be done.  Only after we'd dried him off with a towel did Jennie allow him to return inside.  Jake: His royal Jakeness, our labrador - collie puppy.

       Killer Tortoise   In July 1981 a tortoise was sentenced to death for murder.  Tribal elders in Kyuasini, a village in Kenya, formally condemned the tortoise because they suspected it had caused the death of six people, apparently through magic.  However, because none of the villagers was prepared to risk the tortoise's wrath by carrying out the execution, it was chained to a tree instead.  The tortoise was later freed after the government promised an official inquiry into the deaths.    -- Source:  urlLink Reader's Digest Book of Facts , &copy; 1987, page 82.

       The Good Napkins    Note:  I'm definitely a guy because it took me a couple of times worth of reading and re-reading this before I figured out why this was so funny.  BTW, I got this from  urlLink mom , who picked this up via email, too.  The moral of this story: Always take time to explain.  REMEMBER THIS COULD BE YOU!  My mother taught me to read when I was four years old (the first mistake).  One day I was in the bathroom and noticed one of the cabinet doors was ajar.  I read the box in the cabinet, I then asked my mother why she kept napkins in the bathroom. Didn't they belong in the kitchen?  Not wanting to burden me with unnecessary facts, she told me that those were for "SPECIAL OCCASIONS".  Now fast forward a few months.   It's Thanksgiving day and my folks were leaving to pick up the pastor and his wife for dinner.  Mom had assignments for all of us while they were gone.  Mine was to set the table.  When they returned, the pastor came in first and immediately burst into laughter.  Next came his wife who gasped, the began giggling.   Next came my father, who roared with laughter!  Then came Mom who almost died of embarrassment when she saw each place setting on the table with A "SPECIAL OCCASIONS" napkin at each plate, with the fork carefully arranged on top.  I had even tucked the little tail in so they didn't hang off the edge.  My mother asked me why I used these and, of course, my response sent the other adults into further fits of laughter.  "But Mom, you SAID they were for special occasions!!!"  Take time to laugh, it's the music of the soul. A merry heart doeth good like a medicine, but a broken spirit dirt the bones .  Proverbs 17:22

       We Still Got Power   A representative from the local electric utility company paid us a visit.  We wound up paying him back.  You see, with finances the way they are right now, we've been unable to keep on top of our bills.  You may recall that, in March,  urlLink we had our power shut off once before .  We were able to give the company a little bit of money over the phone, but we had to live an entire day without power.  I am thankful that we recently got our federal income tax refund, because with part of that money we were able to pay off the electric rep.  Partly, anyway.  I just hope the check goes through okay.  God, you are taking care of us, and you are helping us not to be anxious.  Please change our circumstances for the better and help us to thrive during this time.  In Jesus' name, Amen.

       P2P shenanigans   via email from CNET.com  Last week, a federal judge  urlLink threw out  a lawsuit by the RIAA and MPAA against Grokster and Morpheus for copyright infringement.

So nobody is going to break down your door just for having a P2P client installed on your computer. However, according to  urlLink news reports , the major labels might have other tricks up their sleeves, including Trojan horses that may shut down your computer, slow down your Internet connection, or cause other damage. File sharers, beware.   On a positive note, Apple showed the potential for commercial success of digital music by selling more than  urlLink 1 million tracks  through its new iTunes Digital Music Store. And on the PC side, RealNetworks is trying to boost its stake in digital music subscription services by buying out Listen.com, creator of the  urlLink Rhapsody  music service. I don't have any experience with anything like this.

It's something we've wanted to do for a long time to really encourage her.  Mom left with Jennie earlier with no idea that this would happen, so it was going to be a great surprise.  I can't wait until they return.

       Soundtrack of my Life   Around Christmastime last year, I bought an RCA adapter and some speaker wire.  I used it to hook up my computer to our stereo upstairs so that we can play music on our computer throughout the house.  We have over 2000 songs stored on the computer, and it makes for a great soundtrack to my life.  For example, while I'm working today, I'm listening to music from Sting.

       Lay Low and Go!   Last night I taught Keisha what she needs to do in case the smoke alarm goes off.  I demonstrated to her what it sounds like, and we practiced rolling out of her bed, checking the bedroom door to see if it's hot, then crawling to the front door.  We've designated the fire hydrant in our front yard as the safe spot.  We also practiced what we'd do if we were downstairs and the smoke alarm went off.  Keisha thought it was kind of fun, and in a way it was, because we were pretending.  I look forward to practicing this with her more.  Practicing this is especially important since Jennie and I sleep downstairs.  My  urlLink mom  sleeps in the room across from Keisha's upstairs.  I think that if I approach these training situations with an attitude that it's fun, it will help her to remember in case she needs to act in a real situation.

        urlLink Safe on Saturday    This past Saturday Jennie, Keisha, and I went to the  urlLink Boonshoft Museum  for a program that was put on by  urlLink Children's Medical Center .  The intent was to instruct children and their parents about various kinds of safety.  One session in particular was a lot of fun.  It was a puppet show about fire safety.  One of the puppets was a smoke alarm, and he was really wound up at first.  Then he got real sleepy and fell asleep.  The fireman who was moderating the show asked the kids what needs to be done when a smoke alarm goes to sleep.  They answered, "Change the battery!"  At this show and others, we learned about what to do in case of a fire.  Much of it I'd learned before, but I was very grateful for the review.

       We Live in Sinus Valley   I don't claim that we live in the only Sinus Valley in the country, or even the world.  I just know that, from time to time, environmental conditions are such that everyone in our family gets sinus infections.  I've been fortunate so far this season.  My wife Jennie and my daughter Keisha, on the other hand, have not.  Tuesday morning Jennie and Keisha slept in.  Keisha stayed home from school because she had been up all night, complaining from a "scratchy throat".  Jennie was feeling poorly, too.  Since she was a kid, Jennie has been prone to getting bronchitis.  Keisha was feeling better throughout the day and wound up going to school on Wednesday.  On Wednesday, Jennie called our family doctor and scheduled an appointment.  A few minutes later, she asked me what time her appointment was -- she was so "out of it" that she'd forgotten that she'd made the appointment.  I was getting ready to go to a job fair at the Dayton Job Center, so mom asked Jennie if she felt well enough to drive herself.  Jennie asked mom if she would drive her.  I returned home from the job fair at the same time mom and Jennie returned.  Yesterday we went to Meijer to fill another prescription, and I saw the store brand for some sinus/allergy/pain relief medicine.  I bought for myself, because I've been feeling some of the early symptoms.  After we got home, I took the medicine and a nap.  I initially planned for it to only last until Keisha came home from school.  I woke up later when Jennie called me for dinner.  It wound up being a long nap then.  Now it's Friday morning, and Jennie, while feeling a little better from alternating pain relievers, is still experiencing symptoms.  She's going to head back to bed while I take Keisha to speech therapy at Children's Medical Center today.  I may pop some more of those sinus/allergy pills before we leave.

       Camping with the Men   I went camping this past Saturday with some of the men from church to Hueston Woods.  It's located near Miami University of Oxford, Ohio.  I think the last time I went camping was when I was in college, which was a long time ago.  One of the brothers from church has a tent that can sleep 10 people.  On Saturday night it slept 6 of us.  I was rudely reminded that ground is nothing like the mattress I have at home.  We had a great time Saturday night, playing cards, eating food we'd grilled out, sitting by the little bonfire we'd made.  Our campsite was adjacent to the lake, so we could look out over it as darkness fell.  The fireflies lit up the sky as if there were thousands of camera flashes going off.  It was beautiful, and I prayed with a few of the men.  I really needed to spend some time like this with some of the men from church, forging closer friendships.  It was also great on Sunday morning to go for a quiet walk.  I walked a little ways to a hill.  I sat down and wrote a little bit in my observation notebook, which I've entitled "Sights and Sounds."  I opened my Bible to Psalm 126, and, after reading it, sang a song we sometimes sing at church that is based on it, entitled "Men Who Dream."  I belted it out without inhibitions.  Then I sang some more songs to God and headed back to the campsite.  We had church with our little group of men.  If you've ever seen the movie "Glory," you may recall the scene before the troops went into battle.  The men alternatively prayed while the others hummed in the background.  We prayed like that.  It was moving, emotional, and inspiring.  Then Derek, our minister, gave a message about "Salt and Light," based on two of Jesus' famous parables.  Charles, a deaf brother, was one of the brothers who was on the trip.  It was so encouraging to see everyone communicating with him, and to see him trying to communicate with others.  He really has a great friendship with Davon, which overflowed to some humorous moments.  On Saturday evening, Davon, Charles, and some others went for a little hike.  A bit later, Mike decided to sneak up on them.  Davon saw and heard Mike coming, but Charles, of course, didn't hear it.  He loves Davon so much that at one occasion, he turned to Davon, while Mike is approaching them, and said, "My man, Davon!" as Davon was telling him to hurry up and hide from Mike.  Later as we were trying to sleep in our tent, more humor erupted.  Any time Charles would sense that something was going on, he'd turn on his flashlight and shine it around everybody to see who was talking to him.  Of course as I write this I am aware that I'm not fully explaining it so that you can appreciate the humor.  This may be a case of "you had to be there."  Nevertheless, it was a great camping trip.

       Call for Officials!   Come one, come all, to become an Official of this weblog!  Read the F.A.Q. to find out what it entails.  We already have an  urlLink Official Iowan , so that post has been filled.  I'm still pondering which post  urlLink IreneQ  should fill (any suggestions?).  All that's really required is for you, as an Official member of this blog, to check in from time to time with an update on how you are, etc.  You probably do this already, but this is just a really cool way of helping you, as a frequent visitor to this site, to stand out.  You may have noticed that I have a special Links page.  One section of that page is devoted to Officials.  So, when you become an official, you will have your name or your blog name added to that section.  (Note that Mark has his blog button there.)  So, you can consider this as a way of shamelessly self-promoting yourself.  And it's fun, too!  So, tell all your friends in the blogosphere.  I look forward to hearing from you!

       Mundane Journal Stuff   As I  urlLink promised in an earlier post , I'm going to use this journal to, um, journal some of the mundane stuff about my health.  Yesterday... Breakfast:  I ate a banana nut muffin and a blueberry muffin for breakfast.  I had some milk, coffee, and some orange juice. Lunch: A cheeseburger, fries, and medium Cherry Coke Dinner: Some chicken nuggets with mustard, barbeque sauce.  A 7-layer salad.  Water and a can of Coke. Dessert/snack: Two cups of decaf coffee, blended together with about 4 scoops of fat free vanilla frozen yogurt, and about 1/2 ounce of Bailey's Irish Cream.  Topped with whip cream.  Also, as I went to take my medicine last night, I realized that I was out of the Lexapro.  My psychiatrist has me taking the following medicine: 1 - 10 mg tablet of  urlLink Lexapro  at bedtime 1 -   2 mg tablet of Diazepam (generic for Valium) 3 times a day  I've actually been taking 3 mg (i.e., 1-1/2 tablets) at bedtime.  I am reluctant to take this stuff during the day, because it makes me drowsy.  I called the pharmacy last night to put in the refill for the Lexapro.  I need to pick it up at around 11 AM today.  I've taken the Lexapro during the day before, and it makes me drowsy, too.  I probably will take it anyway, since I missed the dose from last night.  This morning, Jennie broght Keisha and I some breakfast, to eat while we watched  urlLink PBSKids : I had a blueberry muffin with some butter, a cup of milk and a cup of orange juice.  Note: when I say I'm drinking milk, it's actually Lactaid, because I'm lactose-intolerant.  I guess that's it for the mundane stuff, for now.

       Bad Joke Alert!   via email from Laura, of all people!   Three elderly ladies are excited about seeing their first baseball game. They smuggle a bottle of Jack Daniel's into the ball park.  The game is really exciting and they are enjoying themselves immensely mixing the Jack Daniel's with soft drinks.  Soon they realize that the bottle is almost gone and the game has a lot of innings to go.     Based on the given information, what inning is it and how many players are on base?           It's the bottom of the fifth and the bags are loaded........

       Long-distance Update   This email comes from a good friend and brother in Christ, who is spending the next two and a half months in Biloxi, Mississippi, away from his wife and daughter here in Dayton, to get some training.  He writes: Well,  Hope this e-mail finds all well in their respective areas.  Just an update on everything down here in Mississippi.  Just got back from class and taking my first block test (there are six total).  My score was a 97%.  I was extremely happy with the results and was the 3rd highest score in the class.  My first quiz in Block II was a 100, the next block however, has a washout (failing and having to re-accomplish) rate of about 40%.  My nose will see two colors, black and white.  Weather has been rainy until Monday, then was nice.  Humid but nice.  I am not use to wearing my blues to school or work for that matter.  But tomorrow is BDUs (Battle Dress Uniform) for all the non-military individuals.   This weekend I went to the Bay of Biloxi and prayed for a while, was really quiet and peaceful.  Nice to be alone.  I am dealing with the stress with exercise and enjoying running 4 days a week.  In July, a bunch of us from class are thinking about chartering a boat and doing a little Salt water fishing.  Sounds like it will be a ton of fun, so hopefully I will take some pictures and e-mail them out.  Well, time to hit the books, It is 12:25 in the morning and need to get some studying done before I fall asleep.  Take Care all Steve

       BANGHEAD!   I visit the  urlLink DiscipleForum  chat area periodically.  'BANGHEAD' is the keystroke combination to produce an  urlLink emoticon  of a smiley (if you can call him that) that bangs its head against a brick wall.  Yes,  urlLink another migraine .  It started this afternoon as I was eating lunch with Keisha at McDonald's.  All of a sudden I saw the "lights" in my eyes.  Oh, boy, I thought.  By the time we arrived home, Jennie decided to take my blood pressure and that  urlLink I need to contact my doctor for a physical .  I tried his office but today happens to be their short day, since they also work on Saturday mornings.  This just doesn't seem right.   I've decided to journal some rather mundane stuff here.  Mundane for other people reading it, but not for me.  Things like medicines taken, what I'm eating, how much sleep I'm getting.  This stuff will probably be a little dry, but in the absence of starting (yet another) blog, I think this is the best thing.  For right now anyway.  Sharing this with the world is also going to humble me, showing me areas of improvement.  Here goes the boring stuff:  I went to bed last night a little after 10 PM.  I woke up this morning to take Jennie to work at 6:30 AM.  I came back home and fell back to sleep until about 9 AM, when I heard Keisha wake up.  For breakfast I had a cup of regular coffee with Irish Creamer, a cup of Lactaid (lactose-free milk), and a cup of orange juice.  That and a cream-filled breakfast roll.  This was at about 10 AM.  I took Keisha to her doctor's appointment at 1:30 PM, and afterward we went to McDonald's.  I ate a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese, a large order of French Fries, and a medium Coke.  As we left, I got a soft serve vanilla ice cream cone.  This was between 2:30 and 3 PM this afternoon.  Upon arriving home, I took Jake for a walk when we got home, around our cul de sac area.  Then Jennie and I had the conversation about me having the physical.  I came back downstairs with Keisha to watch  urlLink PBSKids  with her, and I fell asleep from 4:30 to 6 PM.  For dinner I had a meatball sub sandwich (meatballs and bread), a serving of green beans, and a small serving of potato chips.  To drink I had a 32 ounce glass of water.  I'm going to head to the pharmacy to pick up my refill of  urlLink Imitrex  (you probably know the link by now, as much as I've mentioned them).  I'd like to mow the grass in our backyard, which will probably only take less than a half hour.  Another thing to mention is that  urlLink Ozone Action Days are back .

       Back to Life, Back to Reality   There is always that period, shortly after reading a HP book, that my mind has to settle down.  This time it's happening by Keisha having a summer cold.  I'm taking her to the pediatrician this afternoon.  Also, I'm going to put a couple applications into some restaurants that may be looking for a bartender.  Speaking of which, what'll you have?

       The Order of the Phoenix   Well, it took two whole days of reading, but I finished it!  I feel so much the better as a result.  It's funny how, two-thirds of the way through the book, I push myself harder just to get the book over with.  It's been that way with all 5 of the books.  870 yummy pages in this one.  So, this means I know who dies.  And it wasn't who I was expecting, either.  I was led hook, line, and sinker once more.  When's the next one coming out?  Oh yeah, I need to get back to the rest of my life.

       You Can't Take Me Clothes Shopping   I don't go clothes shopping often.  It shows.  I don't care.  Being married has meant that my wife helps pick out clothes for me.  I don't like spending money on myself for clothes.  I have a big problem with that.  I'm not that good at it, and I can think of a lot of other things I'd rather do.  As  urlLink I mentioned earlier , Jennie packed up a lot of my clothes and we donated them to Goodwill.  This, of course, meant that I needed some new threads.  Jennie, before heading to work this morning, mentioned that Wal*Mart is a good place.  I agreed, but I wasn't that hip to going clothes shopping all by myself.  At about 11 AM this morning, I mentioned to my mom that I was considering grabbing some lunch and heading to Wal*Mart.  I promoted the idea to Keisha by saying that we could look in the toy department at stuff she might want for her birthday.  Mom wasn't feeling that well, so it would have to be just Keisha and I for the trip.  We wound up doing what I mentioned earlier, instead (see " urlLink Her First Time In A Bar - Sort Of ").  I knew that if it was just Keisha and I along for the trip, we'd wind up spending the entire time in the toy area.  Which leads me back to why I love my wife.  She has the style, the panache, the desire, really - to go clothes shopping for me.  I find it boring.  I like getting new clothes, don't get me wrong.  I just don't like the process of getting new clothes.  As usual, I sought for ways to see humor in the situation.  Two things came to mind.  First, I immediately noticed that between the Men's clothing department and the Men's dressing room was the Women's underwear section.  (snicker)  I told the attendant that I'd thought about grabbing me a piece of women's underwear to try on with my shorts and other stuff.  She said, "I wouldn't stop you, if that's what you REALLY want to do."  I also mentioned this to Jennie, to see what kind of reaction this would get out of her.  Secondly, as I was trying on a pair of shorts, I felt the urge to break wind.  I hurriedly got out of the shorts and did my business, trying hard to be discreet.  But that got me wondering, how many other men had tried on that same pair of shorts and broke wind in them?  Have you ever thought of that?   Update:  Jennie (not me) just came back down from showing the new clothes to my Mom.  I really wasn't that excited about it.  I guess you probably figured that out.

       Her First Time In A Bar - Sort Of   This afternoon Keisha and I went out on a date -  urlLink again .  And we went to a bar! Well, sort of.  She is, after all, only almost 6 years old.  Over the weekend, Jennie collected a bunch of clothes - mostly mine - to donate to  urlLink Goodwill .  So today, we had to drop off the clothes to make room in our 1997 Honda Civic sedan.  I was going to take them to the main Goodwill office here in Dayton, but then, I remembered another location.  So Keisha and I went to this other location and dropped off the clothes, which I'll say, were worth a bucketload of money for next year's income tax return ("bucketload" is an inexact measurement, dontcha think?).  Then, we drove across the street to the  urlLink Professional Bartending Institute , where I had my mixology classes.  I showed Keisha the bar area, which is stocked with all the bottles, containing water, food coloring, and other non-alcoholic stuff.  I think Keisha was more impressed with the "Necessary Room," the name the school calls the unisex restroom for men and women.  "The toilet water's blue!" she chuckled. "And it's all just my size!"  So that was her first time in a bar.

       "The Next Romantic Line..."    urlLink Jennie  and I have this running "inside" joke about things we say to each other.  I'm going to try to make you all privy to it.   urlLink Being married , we always look for ways to add romance and love into our relationship.  This also means a lot of humor, often unexpected.  Jennie likes to joke with me, for example, as if everything I say is meant to be a "romantic line."  I'll tell her something that is not at all meant to be romantic, but she'll repeat it, preceded by, "The next romantic line is..."   For example:  Dan : Hey, Jennie, can you go jiggle the handle on the toilet (WC, for our non-American readers)?  Jennie : The next romantic line is... Jennie, can you go jiggle the handle? And we have a good chuckle.  Hmm... I apologize if you don't see the humor.  Perhaps you just have to be there when it happens.

       "Jake Wants Some Love!"   My wife Jennie and I have no problem showing each other affection in front of the rest of the family.  It happens quite often.  The effect is has on Keisha and Jake, however, is hilarious.  As soon as they see both of us loving each other, they want to come right in and join it!  Specifically, this afternoon, Jennie and I were smooching in the kitchen, and Jake started getting all bothered.  We both heard him barking at us, and we ignored it for a bit.  Keisha was sitting at the table, and she said, "Jake wants some love, too!"  So, after a brief moment, I let Jake hop up on my right hip, so that he could stand on his hind legs and be a part of our "love sandwich."  What was missing of course, was Keisha.  But not for long, because she came over and joined in.  Timeless moments.

       Email -- To:, Cc:, and Bcc:   I couldn't agree more with this post from  urlLink Pegasong .  When you send an email with several email addresses in the To: or Cc: line, you are making these email addresses available to everyone who receives the message.  "To:" is intended to be the place where you put who you're sending the message to. "Cc:" is for others you want to receive a Carbon Copy of the message. "Bcc:", or "Blind Carbon Copy" is for messages in which you do not want recipients to know whom else has received the message. I know of several occasions in which someone sent out a message to church friends and family.  One recipient, a fellow member of the church, clicked "Reply All" and replied to everyone on the list with a message that was only intended for the original sender.  Such a message included church jargon, which can offend, alienate, or otherwise confuse others.  The other thing to note is that such messages open up several email addresses for someone to send unsolicited email.  So, let's all behave.

       Long-distance Hello   I got an email from a good friend and brother in Christ, also in the Air Force and stationed at the local Air Force base.  He is spending the next three months away from his wife and daughter, at school in Biloxi, Mississippi.  He writes: Hello all,  It is 1:27 in the morning and I thought I would take a few moments from studying so that I can let everyone know how I am doing.  Well, first the trip down.  I never saw so many law enforcement vehicles in a while.  15 just outside the Kentucky Speedway alone.  The trip was fine after I got lost in Nashville.  Rained almost the entire state of Alabama.  I saw a semi in the ditch with entire load of Mercedes.  Not one came off the truck.  School the first couple of days have been a trial.  Mainly due to not being in a class room enviroment in about 5 years.  However, the info so far has been easy but a ton at one time.  I had 3 quizzes today alone.   Got 90 on all 3 so I was satified with that.  A ton of data to absorb in a short amount of time.  Have a couple of briefings in the morning and am getting a mailing address tomorrow if possible, once I have it I will e-mail it or just ask R. for it, she will get it first.  Well, going to sign off for now.  Take care and love you all.  S.

        urlLink 8 Years Ago, We Said "I Do"!    Today is our wedding anniversary, so today I offer up some memories of that special moment.  I'll have to share some memories of when we got engaged some other time.  I'm tempted to do that here, but that would make for a very looong post.  Come to think of it, if I shared about everything related to our wedding ceremony, that would make for a looong post, too.  So I'll share about one aspect.  I used to drive an hour one way to work, and, once we'd gotten engaged, I began to think of music I wanted for our wedding.  It got the point that, several months before our wedding, I had it all figured out, and I'd listen to it in order on the cassette player we had in our car.  It included "Circle of Life" from The Lion King, "Storms of Africa" by Enya, "Watermark" by Enya, "Say Once More" by Amy Grant, and "Black or White" by Michael Jackson.  Like I said, I had it all figured out.  Our mothers would walk out to "Circle of Life" (the opening version to the movie, not the Elton John version -- I wanted the initial African chant to be part of it).  They would then go up and light the two candles that we'd use to light the Unity candle, and they would also light a candle for Jennie's dad and my mom's parents, who are no longer with us.  Then, the Bridesmaids would each walk out to "Storms of Africa" by Enya.  The music Jennie and her mom would walk out to was "Watermark", also by Enya.  During the times I'd listened to it in the car, I broke down crying because it's such a beautiful song for such a beautiful moment.  When we broke to light the Unity candle and greet our mothers, Amy Grant's "Say Once More" would be played.  Then, after the pronouncement of husband and wife, everyone would hear Michael Jackson's "Black or White."  As I thought about this some more, I recalled one wedding I'd attended in which the groom sung a song to his wife.  I'd heard of this being done before from a coworker who sang Oleta Adams' "Get Here" to his bride as she walked down the aisle.  I decided that I wanted to sing to my bride, too.  I had just begun listening to Contemporary Christian music about six months prior to our wedding, and when I listened to Steven Curtis Chapman's "I Will Be Here," I knew that was the song.  So, I'd sing it on the way to and from work, along with the cassette, until I'd become confident.  I also need to take a moment to thank God for providing so much help to us from members of the church.  People came out from all over to volunteer to serve in so many ways during our ceremony.  One young woman in particular was incredible.  Her name is Svetlana, and she is originally from Bulgaria.  She is a very talented keyboard player and had played in front of church before.  Well, she offered to play the accompaniment while I sang.  One of the many things that makes her so special is that she picked up the music directly from the cassette - with no sheet music.  Well, this was to be one of the highlights of the wedding, and I knew it.  That made me all the more nervous.  The minister and my best man did their best to try to keep me calm: we prayed, of course.  When "Watermark" by Enya started to play, I began to cry.  I couldn't help it.  I tried not to.  Fortunately, our moms were given each a box of Kleenex.  I reached over to grab a tissue from my mom.  And then, as the music continued to play (I'm tearing up as I write this), I saw my beautiful bride walking slowing down the aisle with her mom.  It was at about 11:20 in the morning.  Everyone was so quiet, cameras were flashing all over the place, and all I could think of was how beautiful she truly was.  As I took her hand, I could barely keep my eyes off her.  Then the time came for us to do our wedding vows.  We each had prepared our own, personal vows in addition to the traditional ones.  I let Jennie go first.  I remember her saying so many things, but one thing that stuck out was that she vowed to be my "Balcony Person."  Then it was my turn.  I had some words to say, and I finished it up by saying that the words to this song I was about to sing really conveyed how I felt.  Svetlana launched into the music, and then I felt my heart, throat, and chest clinch up from being so nervous.  I'm still amazed that any words came out at all.  I'm not sure if what I sang even qualifies as music, but somehow I got through it.  The words were more important anyway.  I think that most folks were just blown away that I'd sing to her anyway.  My mom still talks about it.  After that romantic butchering of Steven Curtis Chapman's song, the rest of the ceremony was easy.  I had gotten through it, and we were going to be married no matter what.  So, as the minister pronounced us as husband and wife, I gave Jennie was may be the world record for wedding kiss, and then we danced down the aisle to "Black or White."  I didn't find this out until later, but the groomsmen has orchestrated a cool and unexpected exit.  After Jennie and I left, they each put on a pair of sunglasses, pulled out one white glove, and then put it on.  They escorted their respective bridesmaid and walked out.  Eight years ago.  It's gone by both quickly and slowly.

       Assigned Seating -- For Real   Being a Dad... is a tremedous blessing.  We've had lots of crazy moments, many of which I've mentioned here.  Here comes another one.  Assigned seating at the dinner table has been a big thing for our daughter Keisha.  She decided a few days ago to make it a reality by using a permanent marker to write each family member's name on each chair, so that everyone had their own chair.  Permanent marker.  Our almost-6 year old is still learning to spell, so we all had to figure out whose chair went with whom.  At least she spelled my name correctly.   urlLink Nana 's chair has "Nononon" on it.  She may have spelled Jennie's correctly, except for the upside-down, backwards "e" that is pretty common with kids her age.  And we know that her own is hers because it has her name on it.  I remember buying this furniture on a "90 days same as cash" program 7 years ago.  I guess we need to continue "breaking it in."  But with black permanent marker?  I'm not alone, of course.   urlLink Victor shares the joy of fatherhood with us .

       Feeling Down   Depression in ADHD people comes as a result of coming down off the "high" received from some achievement.  For this reason, it's often hard for ADHD-types to enjoy the accomplishment for very long.  I don't think this is different from what I'm feeling.  I've felt down a bit today.  I've thought about it, and I've concluded that it's a result of having been "up" from the feeling of accomplishment in becoming a certified mixologist.    I suppose it's normal, to some extent.  I talked to my wife Jennie about how I've been feeling today, and she said she felt a bit the same after she had finished her nursing assistant class.  Well, I gotta go take my medicine and get some sleep.

She also said that I'd need a couple days to learn how to run the cash register, which is computerized.  I fill in more details about this job as they come.  Needless to say, I am excited!

       Daddy - Daughter Date    The Venue  Tonight Jennie had one of those "women parties" to attend.  You know the kind, where someone organizes the event and has someone demonstrate products and the women have a good time?  It's definitely a woman thing.  This meant that Keisha and I got to go on a date!  Whoo Hoo!  We decided to go to the  urlLink Dayton Mall  to get some dinner and hang out.  On the way there, we stopped by  urlLink Arrow Wine and Spirits  to look at bartending equipment.  After about 15-20 minutes we left and headed to the mall.   Escalator Escapades, Part 1  We walked inside the mall and headed to the escalator, since the food court is on the second floor.  Keisha was wearing her "flip flop" sandals, and she's still getting used to them.  She was afraid of getting on because she didn't want her feet to get caught.  So I picked her up and placed her on one of the steps.  Getting off at the top was a breeze.   Hamburgers and Hearing Loss  We bought some cheeseburgers from a restaurant, and it turned out that the employee helping us was hearing-impaired, just as Keisha is!  I pointed this out to the both of them, especially so that Keisha could see an adult with hearing loss at work.  The woman's name was Lupka, and she does some sign language, just as we do.  Her sign name is the letter "L" in a counterclockwise circle off to the side.  Keisha's is a "curly K" down the side of her head, to correspond with her curly hair.  Mine is "D" done as a horizontal figure-eight, because I love music.  I spent nearly all of my conversation with Keisha while we ate in sign.  Keisha, who understands sign language rather well, is reluctant to sign.  I think it has a little to do with "being different" from others.  We encourage her to sign with us, but we don't force it on her.   The Carousel Incident  The Dayton Mall has a carousel, commonly referred to as a "merry-go-round."  Along with the horses, there is this bowl-shaped thing in which you can make yourself spin faster while the carousel spins around.  Keisha and I were really looking forward to getting on that part.  She was denied because some older kids got to it first.  Better luck next time, kiddo.  So she sat down on a chairlike-thingy, and I climbed atop one of the horses.  Let me tell you something about the horses.  They are  not  designed for adult men to ride.  I will only go as far as to say that it was, well, uncomfortable.  That's the most euphemistic way of saying it.   Escalator Escapade, Part 2   I was determined to help Keisha have a victory over her fear of riding the escalators while wearing her flip-flops.  After the carousel ride, we needed to find the restroom.  The closest one was on the second floor near the food court.  After some crying, Keisha finally reached her hands onto the railing, which is designed to move at the same rate as the stairs.  That movement encouraged her to move her feet onto a step so that she would not lose her balance.  I was so proud of her and I made sure she knew it.  You should have seen that smile on her face!   Restroom Switcheroo   So we headed for the family restroom.  These are really cute because they have a toilet set up for little kids to sit on; it's only about one-foot high off the floor.  Yet, Keisha asserted the fact that she's getting older and got to the adult toilet before I did.  This actually left me to the kiddie toilet!  It was funny, to say the least.  Fortunately for me, she let me use the adult-sized sink to wash my hands.   Escalator Escapade, Part 3   Undaunted in my quest to help Keisha conquer her fear of the escalator, we headed back.  A little bit of nervousness and reluctance, some reaching out to clutch my body - to no avail, of course - and she again got on the escalator by herself.  I decided that we would try it a couple more times.  Then she said she needed to go potty again.   "You Need to Try, Daddy."   I let her take off her flip flops so that she could run back to the restroom faster.  When we got there, she said she needed to poop, but she decided to use the kiddie toilet this time, leaving me the adult toilet.  I overheard her grunting really hard, and I chuckled.  "Is everything okay over there?" I asked.  "Yeah, I'm just pushing really hard," she replied.  Then a few seconds later: "I'm going to take a rest.  You need to try, too, Daddy."  "I  am ," I asserted.  "No, you need to try to go poop, too," she said.  "I did already.  This morning."  "Downstairs?"  "Yes."  Now that that was out of the way, we finished our business and headed toward the final escalator for our trip down.   Conclusion   We returned to our car, drove to pick up Jennie, and went for some ice cream.  Keisha summarized the entire experience in her own, special way.  There was a lot more that I could share, like some of the strange stuff Keisha said on the way home about what needs to happen if someone doesn't have a nose.  That will have to wait for another post.

       Bengals coach winning over cynical community   The  urlLink Philadelphia Inquirer ,  urlLink CNNSI.com , and  urlLink FOXSports.com  are reporting this story from the Associated Press.  Cincinnati Bengals Head Coach Marvin Lewis, at a lunch for American Red Cross volunteers on Thursday, emphatically told the crowd that he's serious about transforming "the NFL's worst team, which hasn't had a winning season since 1990."  It appears that local residents are picking up the message.  I look forward to seeing how the team will perform this coming season.  I'm not expecting miraculous things to happen, but almost anything could be better than what we've had over the past thirteen years.

       Creative Parenting   Tonight we had a choice parenting moment.  I arrived home tonight from an outing with some guys to find my daughter Keisha neither in bed nor asleep.  She became quite emotional when I began talking with her about heading back upstairs to her bed.  The bottom-line reason she was out of bed, despite her myriad excuses ("My belly hurts", "I want to see my Mommy", "I want to wait for my Daddy to come home") was that she just didn't want to go to bed.  She said she wanted to go to the doctor because her belly was hurting.  Then she said she wanted to go to the hospital.  When I asked her why, she said, "Because they will help me feel better."  "What will they do?" I asked.  "Give me some medicine," she replied.  Well, she needed to put her hearing aids back in (she sleeps with them so that she can hear what goes on), but she needed some lubricant for the earmolds, which fit inside her ear.  We've been using Cornhusker's Lotion, which works like a charm.  I told her that the stuff I put on her hearing aids was like medicine.  Keisha also takes Ditrophan for bladder spasms.  I asked my mom if she knew whether Keisha had been given her evening dose.  She asked Jennie, who said no.  So, I told Keisha that we still needed to give her the "potty medicine," which would help her feel better.  But we agreed to do this only if she wouldn't cry or act upset.  When she said that she couldn't, I told her I didn't believe her, and I smiled.  This caused a small grin to appear on her face.  "See?" I said.  "You can be happy if you want to."  Well, she didn't want to have anything to do with that, and she turned around gruffly and yelled something.  In matters of this sort, I did what every father should do:  I had her sit down with me so that we could pray.  I prayed first and then she prayed.  After this, we agreed to go to the kitchen to get her medicine in a civil manner.   urlLink I mentioned earlier that I've been going to bartending school .  Keisha has picked up on this from hearing me tell Jennie and my mom about the classes.  Since the Ditrophan tastes terrible, we always let Keisha drink something afterward to wash away the taste.  So, I told Keisha that I was basically giving her a "shot" of her medicine, and we agreed that half a cup of cherry kool-aid would work well as a "chaser."  She liked that idea.  I even showed her how to do it.  Having finished with that, I reiterated to her that she'd been given this medicine, and it should help her to feel better.  She returned to her bed, I tucked her in, and did our "good night" ritual, which is a tradition  urlLink my mom  used to do with me.  It goes like this:  Dan:   Good night.  Keisha:   Sleep tight.  Dan:   Don't let the bedbugs bite.  Keisha:   Right! I turned her music on, and I left.  Mission: accomplished.

       Brief Update   Howdy!  I gotta get to school here shortly, but I wanted to provide a brief update on me.  I need to get my prescription for Diazepam refilled within the next day or so, because I will have run out by the end of this week.  Also, I'm almost through with the program in which I get trained to become a professional mixologist.  I am eager to get a job that will let me earn more money than what I've been getting through unemployment compensation.  I'm thinking of looking at one of the mid-scale type restaurants around here, such as Max and Erma's, TGI Fridays, etc.  I had one close friend tell me recently that I would be a great bartender.  I think I'm going to like it, too.  Well, more later.  I gotta get to school!

       That's What Those Numbers Mean!   Ohio's Bicentennial license plates have a number tag on them, instead of the county name.  I've found it annoying to try to figure out where folks are coming from/going to, since I don't have the numbers memorized.  Ohio has 88 counties, and last July I listed them in alphabetical order, which is how the tags correlate to the county name.   urlLink Go take a look .

During the test, you answered four different types of questions — mathematical, visual-spatial, linguistic and logical. We were able to analyze how you did on each set of those questions, which allows us to shed light on the way your brain uniquely functions.  At the same time, we compared your answers with others who have taken the test, and according to the sorts of questions you got correct, we can tell your Intellectual Type is a Visionary Philosopher.  The first thing we can tell you about that is you're equally good at mathematical and verbal tasks, and learn best through experience. But that's just scratching the surface.

       A Weakness    "A simple man believes anything, but a prudent man gives thought to his steps." --  urlLink Proverbs 14:15 (NIV)    This past Tuesday, in the parking lot of a hardware store, a man approached me, asking for help.  He said his car wouldn't start.  I told him I had jumper cables and that we could try to jump start his car.  Upon looking at them, he said they were the wrong kind for his battery and that he really should get a new battery.  He offered to give me $10 if I'd take him to the auto parts store just down the road so he could purchase one.  As we got in the car, I asked him if he went to church, and he replied with an enthusiastic "YES!"  We started talking about some spiritual things, and he recommended that we pray together.  I obliged, of course.  I even gave him one of the business cards I'd made for my job search, which has my name, phone number, and address on it.  Just to keep in touch, you know.  I thought I was making a new friend.  He asked me to stop at a different auto parts store than what he originally said.  It was closer, so I did.  He went inside and returned about 30 seconds later.  He told me that he was three dollars short for the new battery and could I help him out.  He said he had the money at his home and could repay me after he got the new battery.  He also said that he needed $10 for the "core charge" (core charge is what you pay when you don't have the original part with you when you buy a new one).  All I had was a $20 bill, so I handed it to him.  He went inside and returned about a minute later.  He said that they were going to bring the battery to his car, since it was just down the street.  He then asked me to take him home so he could get me $35 to repay me.  By this time I got a little suspicious because it seemed that he was taking me really out of my way.  He took me to the Santa Clara neighborhood of Dayton, which has a reputation for being a rough area.  He directed me to park in front of an apartment building and wait while he went inside to get me the money.  Fifteen minutes later, I realized that I was being scammed.  I left the area upset, angry, hurt, vengeful, yet prayerful.  I went home and shared the experience with mom and Jennie, and then I went for a walk to blow off some steam.  I was feeling seriously depressed about how stupid I was.  On the way to church, I was still feeling a little vengeful.  I fantasized about taking a crowbar to the guy's kneecaps.  Then I remembered the scripture that says that it's up to God to avenge.  At the men's meeting at church, I talked with a couple brothers in Christ about the situation.  I can be way too trusting.  The same kind of scam happened to me once before, about a year and a half ago.  I'm just grateful that I wasn't carjacked or hurt in some other way.  So I'm learning from the "school of hard knocks" not to be too trusting of strangers.  My intentions were godly in trying to help that man, but I could have been more shrewd and gone about it a different way.  I saw the proverb that I listed at the beginning of this post, and I think it's a good one for me to store up and apply to my heart.  Thank you, Lord.

       Simple Humor   A sweet grandmother telephoned Mount Sinai Hospital.  She timidly asked, "Is it possible to speak to someone who can tell me how a patient is doing?"  The operator said "I'll be glad to help, dear. What's the name and room number?"  The grandmother in her weak tremulous voice said, "Miss Holly Finkel in room 302."  The Operator replied, "Let me check. Oh, good news. Her records say that Holly is doing very well. Her blood pressure is fine; her blood work just came back as normal and her physician, Dr. Cohen, has scheduled her to be discharged on Tuesday."  The Grandmother said, "Thank you. That's wonderful! I was so worried!  God bless you for the good news."  The operator replied, "You're more than welcome. Is Holly your daughter?"  The Grandmother said, "No, I'm Holly Finkel in 302. Dr. Cohen doesn't tell me anything."    via email from my friend Bill T.

       What a Guy!   Keanu Reeves is giving &pound;50 million to the unsung heroes of 'The Matrix' sequels:  urlLink the costume and special effects teams .  I don't know what that converts to in US dollars, but it sure sound like a lot of money.  "Asked about his prodigious act of generosity, the actor said he already had enough cash. 'Money is the last thing I think about. I could live on what I have already made for the next few centuries,' he declared."  While shooting the sequels in Australia, he amazed a team of stuntmen by giving them each a &pound;6,000 Harley Davidson motorcycle.  What a great example for others in Hollywood to follow.

       Isn't Reading Fun?   One of the best ways to encourage your children to read is to model it yourself.  If your children see you reading and enjoying it, then they will pick it up, too.  This is one thing I've loved about my Mom and Dad.  They are both avid readers.  This reminds me that I need to update my reading list, which I have set up via  urlLink AllConsuming.net  and add it to  urlLink my homepage .  I used to have it here on this blog, but I thought it would be too cluttered if I kept it on there.  I'm currently reading Frank McCourt's,  urlLink Angela's Ashes .  I felt so lucky to have found the hard cover copy of this book at the used book store for $1.  Today I found out from someone living in Ireland that the book was made into a movie.  I'll have to check with the  urlLink public library  to see if they have it.  What are you reading?

       Dating My Wife   When Jennie and I were dating in 1994, I had just moved up to Dayton, and she still lived in the Cincinnati area.  We'd see each other maybe three times a week.  This was before we got engaged, which is a completely different story.  We started a tradition as our dates would end.  There was a White Castle restaurant close to where she lived, and we'd stop there before I dropped her off at her house (We didn't live together before we were married; I don't think that would have been what Jesus would have done, actually.).  We both liked their coffee and vanilla shakes, and we'd order one of each and then split them both by pouring half of one into the other, and vice versa.  Then we'd hang out for a bit until we'd finished our "mochas."  It was a really good 'bonding' time for both of us, and helped us deal with the reality that I'd be heading back to Dayton after I took her home.  As I took Jennie to work this morning, that memory just popped in my mind.  Yesterday she was off work, and we went to McDonald's to order some of the McGriddle sandwiches that I used to mock.  They're actually really good.  Maybe that experience is what helped me to remember our dates from 9 years ago.

       Divorce and Firing by Mobile Phone   Reuters reports that a  urlLink Muslim authority has declared that it's okay for a Muslim man to divorce his wife via a text message .  Islamic law permits a man to divorce his wife by declaring "I divorce you" three times.  Amazingly efficient.  It's as though marriage doesn't mean anything anymore to some people.  I read recently on  urlLink emblog  that a British personal injury claims firm,  urlLink The Accident Group (TAG), sacked 2500 employees via text-message this past May .  Also, amazingly efficient.  Paperless, too.  Geez.   Update:   Irene commented that the decision by the Muslim authority has been overturned.  Thanks!

       Joke Alert!   During a recent publicity outing, Jennifer snuck off to visit a fortuneteller of some local repute.  In a dark and hazy room, peering into a crystal ball, the mystic delivered grave news.   "There's no easy way to say this, so I'll just be blunt: Prepare yourself to be a widow. Your husband will die a violent and horrible death this year."  Visibly shaken, Jennifer stared at the woman's face, then at the single flickering candle, and then down at her hands.  She took a few deep breaths to compose herself.  She simply had to know.  She met the fortuneteller's gaze, steadied her voice, and asked her question:  "Will I be acquitted?"

       Family Devotional   Tonight we had a family devotional about what it means to "love our neighbor."  For the text, I used the parable of "The Good Samaritan" in  urlLink Luke 10:25-37 .  We didn't use "Samaritan," "scribe," "priest," or "teacher of the law."  To illustrate the story and to make it appear more real, we used some of Keisha's Barbie dolls (I think she has maybe 10 of them now, but this is not the time to go into the "Naked Barbie Woodstock" that our house sometimes becomes.).  She hasn't given all the dolls names, so I told her we would give two of the ones we were using temporary names.  She, at first, had a problem with this.  I assured her that we were only using our imagination and that she could name the dolls whatever she wanted, even if it was at a later date.  For the person who was beaten and robbed, we chose one of Keisha's newer dolls, named Chelsea.  We chose one of her younger dolls, whom we named Ruth, to be a girl who, although she goes to Chelsea's school, doesn't want to be her friend.  We had a Ken doll, who was fortunately wearing shorts, to be a jock-type who thought he was too good-looking to help Chelsea.  Keisha also has a Fisher Price man, who we chose to be the "Samaritan;" i.e., the one who does what is right in the story, and we named him John.  John is much smaller than the other dolls, and we let him have the pink Barbie car for the purpose of our story.  Also, John lives on the other side of town and goes to a completely different school.  John is also black.  For the "bandits," Mom and Jennie used about four of Keisha's other Barbies, and their job was to beat Chelsea up, tousle her hair, and steal her coat, shoes, and purse.  They did a fine job.  The expression on Keisha's face after the mugging and after Ken and Ruth ignored Chelsea was priceless.  The concern, the empathy.  It was great.  Then we brought out John, in his pink Barbie-mobile.  Here he was, in a hurry himself to get home because he had school the next day, and he pulled over to see what had happened to Chelsea.  He even helped her into his car, even though she was about twice his size!  Then he drove her to the hospital, gave the ER doctor a dime (the first coin I found in my pocket), and told the ER doctor to take care of her.  If there was any additional cost, he'd be by tomorrow to take care of it.  After this drama, I took Ruth, Ken, and John.  I sat them down in front of Keisha, and I asked her which one was more like a friend?  She rightly pointed to John.   Update, 30 Jul 2003:  You might appreciate  urlLink Mom's version , too.

       Da Beard Is Gone   The beard is gone The mustache, too It was just something I had to do  For I tugged and pulled At my chinny-chin-chin 'Twas quite a state I found myself in  Then with scissors in hand I moved quickly Until my face Not clean-shaven but prickly  To bed I retired To my wife I did say A surprise for you I'll have the next day  Then waking did she From that restful place My eyes were opened And I showed her my face  To work I drove her With grace and speed Then to the shower Where I'd finish the deed  With no mirror to guide me I lathered and shaved Hoping and praying My neck would be saved  Then finished were we With no time to spare Yes, even no time To do Keisha's hair  Mom stayed behind Her rest she did need Keisha and I Our bellies did feed  Reflecting am I On this brand-new me I've had this beard Since before January  Son, says my Mom, Before we handle our hunger, Your clean-shaven face Makes you look five years younger!  How long will this last I sit here and think How long will my face Stay clean and pink?

       Long-distance Contact   Background:  A friend and brother in Christ from our church here in Dayton is in the Air Force.  He has been on a three-month training stint in Biloxi, Mississippi, away from his wife, whom I'll abbreviate as "R.", daughter, whom I'll abbreviate as "K.", and other close friends.  He emailed this update: I would like to apologize for not keeping in touch lately, in my life right now I have grown quite selfish and very unloving, letting my emotions take control, and not looking where I needed to look for peace.  I really am struggling with my pride right now and allowing my hurt to control my life.  I am officially half way done.  My last two scores for my block tests have been a 90 and 92.  I had hoped that they would be higher but I will be grateful for what I got for scores.  I have to realize that if I tried my best that it should be good enough.  The next block is all about operating systems of Windows, ah back to something that I know about really well.  I am excited and trying not to get complacent.  R. is coming down starting on Thursday, it will be a nice change of the routine of loneliness.  She will be down here until Monday morning.  School shopping for K. will be interesting, I can't wait to hear what she thinks of R. and my taste.  Usually she is a part of the decision making process, but this year will be different.  I keep telling her think of it like Christmas, in the immortal words of forest gump "Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what your goin get."  Only difference, exchange the word life and put clothes.  I have taken a week of running off, not by choice though.  My ankle has been given me some trouble.  I have been off for a week, I am going to give it a try tomorrow.  People ask how I can still lose weight, I tell them.  Eat the chow hall food.  It is a great diuretic.  Kinda makes you not want to eat.  I look forward to the weekends, that is when I treat myself to some fast food.  I think I am getting kinda sick and tired of Anthony's Pizza, Popeye's chicken, A & W, and Robin Hood though.  I don't know how people can last one year on a remote, I have only been gone for 1.5 months and I am going nuts due to the constant routine.  That is about it.  I hope to hear from you soon  Take care and God bless  urlLink Proverbs 14:30

       Americans with Disabilities Act: 13th Anniversary   In  urlLink President Bush's weekly address to the nation , he remarks that the Americans with Disabilities Act is ... one of the most compassionate acts of American government.   Since becoming law, the ADA has helped to improve the quality of life for more than 50,000 million Americans with physical and mental disabilities. As a result, it is easier today for people with disabilities to find a job, to enter public buildings, and to live more independently in their communities. These are all welcome changes in American life. As the father of a daughter who is hard of hearing, I am very grateful for this law, along with the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA).  Because of the IDEA, Keisha is guaranteed the opportunity to succeed in school.  I am also very grateful to the individuals who have served her and us: the special education teachers and workers, the audiologists and speech therapists.  I am also grateful for the wonderful help we've received from the Community Services for the Deaf here in Dayton.  I realize that no program is perfect, and there is much more work left to do.  Nevertheless, I can see how God has blessed us to be able to live in a time like this.

       Jesus Was A Blood Donor!   Yesterday, 24 July 2003, I donated blood at the local  urlLink Community Blood Center  in downtown Dayton.  It had been so long since I last donated that I couldn't remember when it was.  I have to wait at least 8 weeks for the red blood cells to regenerate before I can donate again, which means that I'll be able to donate again on Thursday, 18 September 2003.  I first donated blood when I was 17 years old at a blood drive held at our high school.  I have good veins, the phlebotomists say, for donating.  For most of my recent donations, I've used my left arm, since I'm right-handed.  Last night, the phlebotomist recommended I start alternating because of the scar tissue that has formed in my left arm from donating so much.  We'll see.  I don't like needles, but I donate anyway.  I usually am a bit nervous when the nurse pricks my finger to check if there is enough iron in it.  Then, when I head back to the blood collection area, I cannot look at the needle as the phlebotomist injects it in me.  My wife, on the other hand, is different: she wants to see what's going on.  The inside of my elbows are extremely ticklish.  Hence, I giggle and wriggle when the phlebotomist cleans the area with antiseptic and iodine.  This always makes the other staff members chuckle, too.  The entire experience of donating, from the time I arrived to the time I was finished, took about 45 minutes to an hour.  I share this experience for my own benefit so that I'll remember to donate in September.  I also share this to encourage you, gentle readers, to consider donating blood.  I understand that there are many medical reasons why some individuals cannot.  I've been ill a lot this year, and that has prevented me from donating earlier.  But even if you are not able to donate, you can still send out the message to others who might be able to do so.  I titled this post, "Jesus Was A Blood Donor!" as a reminder that Jesus gave his blood so that we could be healed: He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed. ( urlLink 1 Peter 2:24 ) .  When I meditate on his "blood donation," I am more willing to endure a little discomfort - if you could even call it that - so that someone else can get a chance to live.  Take care!

        urlLink Admitting Struggles with Mental Illness : Followup   I recently received an email about my recent post.  I've attached links to text in the email - where applicable - so that you can refer to them. Hello :) I am a Christian and struggle with depression and self-injury.  I just wanted to say thanks for  urlLink your post . It was encouraging just to hear someone else admit they struggle with self-injury. I admire that very much. I still have a lot of difficulties admitting my struggle with it, especially to people who have never struggled with it also. I actually found that by chance. A friend sent me a link to your blog to look at the  urlLink pictures of the flood  but it sent me to the top of the page where this post was instead. Kinda like God was showing me I'm not as alone as I think I am. So thanks. :)

       Most-frequently used letters?   I have recently noticed that some of the keys on my keyboard are beginning to fade; namely, A, S, E, and T.  Could these be my most frequently used letters?  What about R, N, and L?  Well, I do know that these letters tend to be the ones that contestants on "Wheel of Fortune" (sorry!  find your own link, I feel lazy and rushed right now) pick.

        urlLink Adult ADHD | a difficult diagnosis    In this article from WebMD, John Casey writes: Treating adult ADHD is fairly simple, but diagnosing it is difficult. Many adults realize they have ADHD when their children are diagnosed with it.   I've been re-reading Thom Hartmann's book  urlLink Attention Deficit Disorder: A Different Perception , which I was fortunate to get used at a bookstore last year.  I've shared my discoveries with my  urlLink mom , who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  She seems to believe that she may have ADHD as well.  It is not uncommon for both to be diagnosed as the other.  More from the article: In June, [Dr. Lenard Adler, director of the Combined Departments of Psychiatry and Neurology Adult ADHD Program at New York University School of Medicine,] and his colleagues released a survey of how 400 primary care doctors rated their ability to diagnose adult ADHD: Nearly 50 percent of the doctors said they do not feel confident in diagnosing ADHD in adults...  Working with the World Health Organization, Adler and his colleagues developed an ADHD screening test asking patients to answer six questions about their behavior. If they score high, they take a more precise, 18-item symptoms checklist test.         “The advantage of the self-test is that it is patient friendly and standardized,” says Adler. “We hope this will take a great deal of guesswork out of diagnosis.”         The ADHD self-assessment test, which is copyrighted by the WHO, is available online at  urlLink www.med.nyu.edu/Psych/training/adhd.html . I took a self-assessment type of test in January/February 2002, and I scored high in certain areas, which led my psychiatrist at that time to diagnose me with ADHD.

       Drive-Thru Wonder   As I drove Jennie to work this morning, we saw an  urlLink RTA bus  driving around an  urlLink Arby's  parking lot.  We wondered what it would have been like if the driver had stopped to place an order:  Drive-Thru Operator:  Can I help you?  Bus Driver:  Yeah, I have 20 separate orders... I find it so funny any time I see a massive vehicle move as though it were not.    About thirteen years ago, I worked for a company that made tanks for the U.S. Army.  One week, the company was preparing for a visit from then-General Colin Powell.  I had a great view of the grassy area in front of the office building.  One day I looked out and I saw a tank speeding down the grass at about 40 miles per hour, when it turned on a dime.  That was too cool!

       I'm Free   Don't grieve for me, for now I'm free; I'm following the path God laid for me. I took His hand when I heard Him call; I turned my back and left it all.  I could not stay another day, to laugh, to love, to work or play. Tasks left undone must stay that way; I found that place at the close of day.  If my parting has left a void, then fill it with remembered joy.  A friendship shared, a laugh, a kiss; Ah yes, these things, I too, will miss.  Be not burdened with times of sorrow; I wish you the sunshine of tomorrow. My life's been full, I savored much; Good friends, good times, a loved one's touch.  Perhaps my time seemed all too brief; Don't lengthen it now with undue grief. Lift up your heart and share with me; God wanted me now.  He set me free.   I do not know who wrote the poem above.  It was inside a memorial flyer we picked up at the recent visitation for a friend.

       Little Angels   When God calls little children to dwell with him above.  We mortals sometimes question the wisdom of His love. For no heartache compares with the death of one small child. Who does so much to make our world seem wonderful and mild. Perhaps God tires of calling the aged to His fold. So He picks a rosebud before it can grow old. God knows how much we need them, and so he makes but a few. To make the hand of Heaven more beautiful to view. Believing this is difficult, still somehow we must try. The saddest word mankind know will always be goodbye. So when a little child departs, we who are left behind, must realize God love children. Angels are hard to find.   I do not know who wrote the poem above.  It was inside the funeral announcement I picked up at a recent visitation.

       Visitation   Jennie and I attended the  urlLink visitation for the three people killed in the automobile crash this past Sunday .  It was a heart-wrenching experience.  The line to see and be with the dearly departed extended outside the funeral home.  As soon as we got to where the caskets were, I saw Kieran.  She was dressed in a nice outfit, wearing a baby hat.  A baby blanket was placed over her.  Sunday was her one-year old birthday.  She was born and she died on the same day, one year exactly.  We had met her parents before when they visited our church with Sarah and Bill.  Her parents are in their early to to mid twenties, and they remained beside her casket as people came in.  Kieran's mother clutched one of her daughter's stuffed toys, and both she and her husband openly wept aloud.  They said they were grateful that they had her for as long as they did, but it was obvious that there would still be a lot of grieving.  The next casket down was Sarah's.  She was only 22 years old.  It had been awhile since I'd last seen her.  I believe it was late last summer, at their oldest son Kade's 3 year old birthday party in a park.  The funeral home did a wonderful job with her makeup and outfit.  Yet, for some reason, I could tell she didn't look the same.  This gave me a little bit of an idea how horrific the accident was.  In the last casket was Hayden, Bill and Sarah's youngest son, 20 months old, born just six days after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.  He looked different, too from what I remember.  He was dressed in a "little-man" outfit.  Bill remained by his and Sarah's caskets.  He said that he had been going through a cycle of emotions.  I told him that I didn't know what to say.  My mom had given me an envelope with some words she'd written for him.  I handed it to him, and he placed it in his suit jacket.  If there can be any good to come from this, it may be that the two babies never had an opportunity to grow up and reject God.  Sarah had been a disciple of Jesus Christ, and we can pray that her heart was right with God.  Inside the memorial flyers, along with the details of the three individuals, were two poems that I'm going to post:  urlLink Little Angels  and  urlLink I'm Free .

       Changed Lives   "I never realized it when I was a student, but after I became a teacher, everything changed and my world was never the same." -- Ganns Dean,  urlLink Superblessed , the July 21, 2003 post  After I saw this quote on  urlLink blogs4God , I had to visit.  Then I found out that Ganns, who lives in the Philippines, had written about his experience from watching  urlLink Mr. Holland's Opus .  I decided to comment:  urlLink Mr. Holland's Opus  is one of my all-time favorite movies, too.  I can relate with it on so many levels: the love of music, marriage/family/work balance, teaching, and I have a daughter who is hard of hearing.  I've been told by other teachers that I would make a good teacher.  When our daughter was little, and even now, though not as frequently, I would sing "Beautiful Boy" to her, but change it to "Beautiful Girl".  Once I learned how to sign it, I began signing it to her.  This would be a great song to help her stop crying or to help her fall asleep.  I, too, wind up in tears by the end of the movie.

        urlLink Calif. Recall Gets Real; Election to Oust Davis Coming This Fall    U.S. Newswire reports: The unusual effort to recall California Gov. Gray Davis (D) heads into a new phase Wednesday as county officials from around the state are expected to announce that enough signatures have been gathered to set the recall election process in motion. Staff writer Peter Savodnik reports in the July 23, 2003, issue of The Hill that the move will have an impact from California to Washington, D.C. Observers are watching to see whether the unpopular Davis's travails will help or hurt President Bush's reelection prospects. "This is California," said Phil Eisenberg, a former Democratic state assemblyman who now works as a lobbyist in Sacramento. "We go through political theater every 35 minutes. We have bizarre things happen to us."

       Out She Comes! Part 5   When the doctor said, "Let's have this baby!" I was puzzled.  I thought that's what we were already doing.  What he really meant was that Jennie was going to start pushing.  I don't remember if he increased the Pitocin dose or not -- come to think of it, he may have reduced it -- I can't remember for sure.  So, as a contraction started Jennie began to push.  And push she did.  I had never seen anyone go through labor before, but I'd heard that women show so much strength that it behooves a man to appreciate and respect her so much more.  Cindy was taping the labor, which we later determined to be about 21 minutes long.  I can hardly imagine going through 21 minutes of pushing, but Jennie did.  I recall Sue asking Cindy, toward the end of that 21 minutes, "Is that hair I see?"  which I took to mean that Keisha was close.  After about 17 minutes, the doctor became concerned.  Every contraction was beginning to affect Keisha's heartbeat.  We weren't getting anywhere with the natural birthing, so he ordered a Caesarean section.  An anesthesiologist came in to administer a "spinal" to Jennie, but she couldn't find the place in Jennie's back to inject the anesthesia.  So the doctor ordered a "general" anesthetic, which would put Jennie to sleep.  Jennie was taken to an Operating Room, where they would perform the Caesarean.  Because she was under a general anesthetic, I wasn't allowed in the room.  I felt very saddened by it.  Cindy, who manned the camera, asked me to comment on camera what was going on.  I explained it to an older Keisha, who would later be watching this video.  Then I heard something that made me break into tears.  I heard our baby crying behind me.  Keisha was born at 10:42 PM, July 17, 1997!  The nurse came out to get a port-a-crib thingy, which they would use to transport Keisha to the Transitional Nursery.  She said that I could come in to see her.  So Cindy handed me the camera.  Just minutes from being outside the womb, there she was: all wrapped up in cloths, crying.  I was in awe.  God's creation, which we'd waited for nine months, was here!  I followed the nurse to the Transitional Nursery, where I met Ms. Yvetta, the Transitional Nurse.  She checked all of Keisha's vitals, and I was able to tape the whole event.  It would be important, I knew, for Jennie and an older Keisha to see all of this.  Yvetta gave Keisha her first bath, and Keisha cried when she got her hair washed.  She still doesn't like getting it washed.  Then it was time for me to clean her umbilical cord.  I was so nervous; I didn't want to hurt my baby or anything like that.  Yvetta reassured me that everything was okay.  Then I got to put her very first diaper on her.  It was a little thing!  But then again, so was my baby!  Sort of.  She weighed in at 7 pounds, 2-1/2 ounces, and 21 inches long.  After the Transitional Nursery, we took Keisha to go meet her Mommy, who was waking up in the Recovery Room.  It was a beautiful event.  I can remember holding our baby in my arms, just like it was yesterday.  Having a baby changes your life forever.

       Prayer Request:   urlLink Mom, two kids die in pileup on I-70    The Dayton Daily News reports: A 21-year-old mother and her two toddlers were killed instantly Sunday when their small, light blue Toyota was crushed between two semis in a seven-vehicle, chain-reaction collision on Interstate 70 East in Vandalia, said Lt. Art Combest of the Ohio State Highway Patrol's Dayton post. I saw this on the news last night.  This afternoon, I received the following e-mail from the evangelist of our church: I wanted to let everyone know, yesterday there was a bad accident up on I-70 and Sarah, Hayden (their 2 year old son) and Sarah's niece were all killed in the accident.  Be praying for Bill and their families.  We will not have midweek tomorrow night so if you can pass on the word.  There  will be a viewing tomorrow night... You can call if you have any questions or if you need anything.  It is definitely very emotional, lets all be there for each other and for Bill and their families. Bill, a member of our church, within the last year had gone through a divorce from his wife Sarah, who was killed in the accident.

       I Am Somebody     This poem is something the kids at Keisha's school recite at the beginning of every day.  I do not know who wrote it.  It's much more inspiring than the song they sing about their school, which I personally find to be just plain silly.    I am somebody. I am capable and loveable. I am teachable, therefore I can learn. I can do anything when I try. I respect myself and others. I'll be the best that I can be each day. I will not waste time, because it is too valuable, and I am too precious and bright. I am somebody.

       First Day of Kindergarten   Today is Keisha's first day of Kindergarten.  The teachers had a one-hour meeting with parents to talk about how the classes operate.  There is a huge emphasis on the kids' learning how to read.  The meeting conveyed a lot of important stuff for us parents, but there were a couple of times when Keisha turned to me and said, "Are they almost done?"  Then, after the meeting adjourned the kids went to their chairs and sat down.  I went to Keisha and said, "I'm going to go now, and Ms. Fabian will take care of you.  She knows exactly what time the bus will be coming to take you home."  Keisha smiled.  I gave her a kiss, and then I left, half wishing that I could be a fly on the wall.

       Web Site Design: Images   One discouraging thing I've found when surfing the Internet, is the extraordinary amount of time I'm expected to wait while a graphic loads.  I'm using a dialup connection because I cannot afford a high-speed one right now.  I've even had my browser crash on me while trying to load certain websites.  That is why, I urge all of us web developers, to shrink the physical size of our graphics.

       Get More Energy!     Get moving.   Just about anyone, at any age, can do some type of activity to improve his or her health or well being.  Take a short walk around the block or through a mall after dinner.  The more exercise you get the more energized you become.  Always check with your doctor before beginning any exercise routine.  Eat healthier by eating a variety of foods.   Make sure you get enough of the right types of foods each day.  The National Institutes of Health recommend five or more servings of vitamin-packed fruits and vegetables every day for better health.  Limit most foods with caffeine since they provide an artificial boost but little nutrition.  Go outside for a few minutes in the sunshine.   This will not only feel good, but the vitamin D in the sunlight will actually help your body process calcium, an essential nutrient for strong bones.  Get a good night's sleep.   For more energy try going to bed a half-hour before you normally do at least one night a week.  Finally, do something that makes you happy at least once a week.  Read a book; have coffee with a friend; listen to music -- anything that you enjoy and that you look forward to doing.  You might find that making time for yourself is the best "energizer" of all.    We received this information from our pharmacy.  The paper on which it came lists the source as Catalina Health Resource.

I received this in December 1987, which was during the first part of my senior year of high school.  She wrote: Danny, here is the newspaper clipping I told you about.  You have a bright future ahead of you, and I expect to hear wonderful things about you.  Keep in touch!  Mrs. Allen The newspaper clipping is from a section of the paper in which they talk about what local kids are up to.  It reads:  MOUNT HEALTHY HIGH SCHOOL  Senior  Daniel Allen Johnson, Jr.  held the office of bailiff for the Court of Common Appeals at the American Legion Buckeye Boys State at Bowling Green State University.  He is the son of Daniel A. Johnson, Sr. of Dunraven Drive. Finding this card today, it was like being encouraged all over again.  I'll have to blog about my experiences at  urlLink Buckeye Boys State  sometime.  The local American Legion chose two incoming seniors to go to Boys State.  I was honored to be chosen as one of them.

       Spy Kids 2 Birthday Party   We had Keisha's birthday party this afternoon.  It was a great success.  I'm not used to playing host to these kinds of things, and I find myself feeling insecure: Is so-and-so feeling "tied-in" with everyone else?  She looks bored.  You have the usual, gregarious folk that congregate together, of course.  Not everyone we invited showed up.  Keisha was initially a little disappointed.  But that dissipated once others started arriving.  My aunt and uncle drove up from Cincinnati, with their daughter DJ, who is a little younger than Keisha's age.  Also, two boys from Keisha's class in school came over.  I had grilled some hotdogs and bratwurst before the party started, and mom and Jennie set everything else up.  We had all the guests help themselves to the food, and I started the movie "Spy Kids 2".  After about a half hour, I could tell that some of the kids were a bit distracted ("When are we gonna have cake and ice cream?  When is Keisha gonna open her presents?").  We decided to stop the movie midway to serve the cake and ice cream and for Keisha to open her presents.  Once that was over with, I asked them if they wanted to watch the rest of the movie.  Most of them had decided to do other things, and others had to go to other birthday parties.  Eventually, the only kids left were Keisha and DJ, who were playing with Keisha's new Barbie stuff.  I decided to finish the movie, play the music video, and rewatch it with the director's commentary.  Now, I just hope there is a little bit of time before Keisha starts planning next year's birthday party.  Mom said earlier that next year's color is going to be brown.  That's right, folks, my daughter changes her favorite color each year.  Two years ago, it was green.  Last year it was pink.  Now for her 6th year it's blue.  This kid practically has her whole life planned out.  What an imagination.

       Out She Comes! Part 4   At the Wendy's inside Miami Valley Hospital, I tried to relax and enjoy a meal, while Jennie was in the Berry Women's Pavillion getting ready to have our first child.  I spotted a copy of the Dayton Daily News, and I remembered that they have a section where they describe "This Day In History."  Since that day, July 17, 1997, was going to be Keisha's birthday, I found the section and cut it out to keep.  I looked around and wondered silently what the other people in the restaurant were doing at the hospital.  How many, for example, were there because of a baby being born, too?  After I finished my meal, I returned to Jennie's room.  Cindy had set up the video camera and was offering Jennie some ice chips.  We heard two sets of beeps: one was Jennie's heartbeat, and the other was Keisha's!  We saw some instrumentation that showed how intense the contractions were.  I set up the tape player to play the "Lullaby" tape I'd made for Keisha a month before.  It consisted of lullabies from around the world.  I was able to record the entire CD on both sides of the tape.  We would play it for Keisha at home before going to the hospital, and we hoped it would be a kind of "welcoming sound" for Keisha as she was born.  Jennie was a trooper, and my respect for her was about to grow 1000%.  We'd do the breathing exercises we'd learned at the Lamaze classes to help alleviate the pain, but after a few hours, Jennie wanted some relief.  She asked for Nubain.  The doctors increased the Pitocin to help the contractions along, and we waited for a little while longer, before the doctor came in at about 8:30 PM to say, "Let's have this baby!"  to be continued...

       Friday Funk   I've been in a funk for almost the entire day today.  I woke up reluctantly, and strained to keep my eyes open as I took Jennie to work.  I returned home and laid back down until the alarm went off at 9:30 AM, when I needed to get Keisha up and ready for her speech therapy appointment.  We each ate some toast, took our medicines, and by 10:30 AM we headed to Children's Medical Center.  Keisha's speech therapy appointment went well.  I spent most of the time reading, but I felt like I could have just napped.  After her appointment, Keisha and I returned home.  I persuaded her that we needed to lay down for a nap until PBS Kids came on at 1:30 PM.  At 1:30 PM the alarm went off, and I turned on PBS for Keisha.  I reset the alarm for 2:30 PM, since I'd needed to pick Jennie up from work.  Jennie and I returned home, and I laid myself back down for another nap.  We received a phone call from our realtor stating that someone wanted to see the house this afternoon at 5:30 PM.  So we all decided to head to Kroger to pick up some food supplies for Keisha's birthday party tomorrow.  Then we came home and ate dinner.  After that, I sat on the couch to watch the movie Enemy at the Gate, with Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes.  Good movie.  Then Jennie and I came down here to head to bed.  I hope that tomorrow I feel much better.  Maybe it's the medicine, the nutrition, the sleep, the weather, or a combination of all that created the physical/emotional funk.  Tomorrow is Keisha's "Spy Kids 2" party, so blogging may be light.

       Out She Comes! Part 3   We had taken "Lamaze" classes at Miami Valley Hospital about a month before Keisha was to be born.  It was good for us, especially since this was our first child.  One of the big reasons we chose to have Keisha at Miami Valley was the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).  That hospital was the only one in the area with an NICU.  I cannot remember if there was a full moon that day or not, but there were so many women in labor when we arrived that there was no room for us in the regular triage area, so they placed us in a high-risk maternity room.  The main focus at this point was to see whether or not Jennie was, in fact, in labor.  So we waited for a little while, chuckling about the fact that so many other women were giving birth today at the hospital, too.  Jennie told me that she definitely would like to have the baby while we were already at the hospital, so we were hoping for the triage nurse to see things that way, too.  When the triage nurse finally came, she took a sample of the fluid that we thought would indicate that Jennie's water had broken.  She determined that it was amniotic fluid, which meant that, yes, Jennie would be having the baby.  The hospital staff then led us to a "birthing room," and Jennie was given some Pitocin to help start the contractions.  We also called the two women she wanted to be present: Cindy and Sue.  Jennie had been at Miami Valley when Cindy had given birth to her daughter Emiko.  Sue was a close friend from church.  Then, I had to make another important phone call.   Jennie and I had decided that living in the apartment we had in Fairborn was going to be too expensive once we had Keisha, so we were searching for another place that was cheaper.  She had made an appointment for us to go see an apartment in Dayton for the afternoon of the 17th.  I called our future landlord and left a message, saying that we would not be able to make the appointment because we were, um, having a baby.  When Cindy arrived, she told me I should go get something to eat, because Jennie was going to be okay for a little while.  Miami Valley has a Wendy's restaurant inside, so I went there.  to be continued...

       Living Underneath the Air Show   The  urlLink 2003 Vectren Dayton Air Show  is going on as I type this.  I drove to pick Jennie up earlier, and I saw planes above, doing aerobatic loops and such.  Then, while waiting in the parking lot, I saw at least 5 Navy planes fly across in a V-formation.  It's pretty impressive to see, from this perspective.  I'm sure it's even more impressive at the airport.

       Out She Comes!, Part 2   I had been an emotional wreck the entire month of July 1997.  Pressures from work, anxiety about becoming a father for the first time, and other responsibilities at church and elsewhere, meant that I had to spend a lot of time in prayer.  I remember at least one nearly all-night prayer time along the Great Miami River in Dayton, begging God for the strength.  As I filled up the gas tank in Sidney and headed south on I-75 on July 17th, I continued praying.  Thankful to God, but greatly nervous about what was going on.  I think I was concerned for both Jennie and Keisha.  I really wanted to make it to the hospital in time.  Fortunately, I had an hour's worth of drive time.  When I got home, I rushed in to find Jennie all ready to go.  I grabbed the suitcase with her clothes.  I also had a tape recorder that I had been using for about a week to record the thoughts that were rushing through my mind.  We left for Miami Valley Hospital, and I spoke to the tape recorder, describing what was going on.  I then asked Jennie for her comments.  She said something like, "I think Daddy is more nervous than anyone right now."  It was the truth.  We arrived at the hospital parking garage and headed for the admission area.  We completed all the paperwork that was necessary.  Because Jennie wasn't in active labor -- it was later determined that, when the doctor said her water had broken, it was a "slow leak" - otherwise things would have been different.  to be continued...

       Out She Comes!, Part 1   During the last month that Jennie was pregnant with Keisha, we would go to the doctor’s office every week to see how far she was.  The next appointment happened to be on Thursday, July 17, 1997, at 2 PM.  We woke up that morning just as we had done in previous mornings.  After eating breakfast and studying my Bible, I drove the hour-long drive from Fairborn to Sidney, Ohio, where I worked as an Environmental Engineer.  I had been struggling with getting the Release Prevention Control and Countermeasure (RPCC) Plan finished.  Also that day we had a water-based paint waste pick up, which I was required to supervise.  At about 11 AM, just as I had finished all the paperwork for the waste shipment, my pager went off.  I looked down to see what it said: 431-0014 911, which was the code Jennie and I had agreed upon to indicate that it was time for me to take her to the hospital.  Could it really be THE time? I thought.  I walked over to the Shipping and Receiving office, which was located nearby and called my wife.  “I think I might have had my water broken.  I called the doctor’s office, and they said that I shouldn’t go in for my appointment but instead that we should go straight to the hospital.”  “OK,” I said.  “Let me go back to my office so that I can drop off my stuff, and I’ll be on my way.”  As I hustled back to my office, I told all my other co-workers that today was the day.  “We’re going to the hospital!”  When I got to the car, I noticed that – of course – I was almost out of gas.  Remember that we lived an hour away from where I worked and Jennie’s water had just broken.  to be continued...

       Quite a Contrast     urlLink Her hell before dying   is a story reported in the New York Daily News about an 8-year old girl whose body was found in a sanitation dump in Queens New York last week.  She was in the foster care of a woman named Renee Johnson.  In his email, a man from New York writes: I wanted to get a look at this woman, put a face to the name, you know?  I entered it into my Yahoo search engine, and would  you guess what I stumbled on…your daughter's home page. God works in mysterious ways.  I just thought she was adorable instantly.  I also liked the design of the web page and assumed that her parents had set it up for her. I was blown away!

       Remembering the Past: Dad's Bike   I cannot remember exactly how old I was, but I know that I was in either junior high or high school when it happened.  Dad would let me use his bike to ride around during the summer.  It had a bike chain lock on it.  I loved riding that bike.  My dad and stepmother would let me head off for the entire day as long as I showed up in time for dinner.  One of the things I liked doing was going to the Service Merchandise store on Colerain Avenue, across from Northgate Mall.  I loved looking at the electronics, especially the keyboards.  Well, on this particular day, I didn't lock Dad's bike up because I thought I'd only be in the store for a short time.  In typical ADHD fashion, I wound up spending at least an hour, fixated on all the stuff that was inside the store.  When I came back out to leave, the bike was gone.  I think I called home to see if June (my stepmother) would come pick me up, because I was pretty far away from home to walk.  I felt so terrible, and I knew I was going to get it from my Dad.  I went to my room and waited until he came home from work.  I didn't know what to say, except to tell him what happened.  I think I was grounded for a little while.  A few years later, still feeling a little bit guilty about the situation, I had enough money from a part-time job, and I bought two new 12-speed bikes: one for me and one for my Dad.  I gave him his bike on Father's Day, and I used mine when I went to college.  I don't remember him using it that much, though.  I think my younger brother Jason wound up using it.

       House, Attorney, Open House, Dessert, Prayer   Our house is on the market to be sold as a "short-sell", which, in simplistic terms, means that the mortgage company agrees to let our house be sold for less than we owe on it, based on our financial situation.  On Saturday, while we were  urlLink at the park , our realtor brought someone through the house, and this individual has made an offer.  We had a very brief meeting with a bancruptcy attorney yesterday.  I like this guy.  He came out in his white socks; i.e., without any shoes on.  His office was huge, too.  I had had an ADHD moment, in which I originally wrote down that our appointment was at 4PM in two areas of my planner, but when I transferred it to the daily page, I wrote it down as being at 4:30PM.  So, we had to reschedule the appointment.  This was a good thing, since we still have much paperwork to go through.   urlLink I only went through the upstairs mail yesterday .  We have an entire table and then some to go through downstairs.  I told the lawyer that I'd been in denial, and he replied that my behaviour was typical.  He encouraged us to continue going through the mail... that the mail cannot hurt us... that there's no such thing as debtor's prison (it was done away with 200 years ago - thank God!).  The attorney also gave us a more realistic understanding of what our options were, including some stipulations that are present with us doing a short-sell.  After Jennie and I came home, we took Keisha to her new school, Valerie Elementary, for the open house.  It was encouraging to see all the parents there, to meet Keisha's Kindergarten teacher, and to see some parents and kids we'd known from Gettysburg, the school Keisha attended last year.  I think it's a bit of an understatement to say that Keisha is excited about going to Kindgergarten, and I think we're all going to enjoy it with her.  After we came home, Keisha did something that was just so sweet.  Entirely on her own, she pulled out 4 bowls, 4 spoons, and made sure that there were 4 cups.  She then went to the freezer to get the two half-gallon containers of ice cream and made us all dessert!  No one told her to do that; she decided to do it on her own!  That's MY daughter, people! :D  Then, after Jennie and Keisha headed downstairs, I walked outside to talk to  urlLink Mom .  I asked her if she wanted to pray together with me about all the stuff going on with us, along with some specific prayers for certain individuals.  That was just great.  I love my Mom!

       Admitting Struggles with Mental Illness   On  urlLink blogs4God today , I read where  urlLink Ben  had shared his thoughts on admitting his struggles with depression.  I felt compelled to share from my own experiences.  My comments: Ben,  I struggle with chronic depression, anxiety, and I have ADHD. I've noticed some tendencies toward obsessive-compulsive behavior, too. Finally, I self-injure -- I pick at scabs, because the physical pain feels better than emotional discomfort I may be feeling.  I believe that a lot of this is biological. Some of it is within my control. I currently see a therapist and a psychiatrist. I take medicine for depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I've seen benefits.  I recognize that there are aspects of how I feel that are within my control, and there are other aspects that are not, but are more to do with what's going on inside, from a physiological perspective.  I've been able to see this, I believe, because I talk about it with others in person, at doctor/therapist appointments, and in  urlLink my writing .  I've seen aspects of myself in the demon-possessed man we read about in  urlLink Mark 5 .  I've learned more about God's grace and mercy, and I've struggled with a low self-esteem (Why do I have to deal with this? Why are certain things harder for me to deal with than it is for other people? Why did God make me this way?) I encourage myself with  urlLink Psalm 139  - recognizing that  urlLink I am fearfully and wonderfully made; i.e., God don't make no junk .  These are just some thoughts. Feel free to contact me to share about what you're feeling, along with any comments you might have about what I've said. I hope that by me sharing my own experiences that it builds mine and others' faith.  Also, I would love to correspond with anyone else who struggles with these things.

       The Rains Have Come Down   ... and the floods have come up.  That's a line from a children's song we sing at church.  It's about Jesus' parable of the Wise and Foolish Builders.  Now that I've said that, remember last week when I'd mentioned  urlLink it had been raining a lot ?  I spotted this  urlLink Flood Emergency  story from NBC22.  Most of the crops in the farmlands located in the northern Miami Valley are under water.  A picture in the Dayton Daily News last week showed that Grand Lake Saint Mary's spilled over into the surrounding area.  Dayton is situated downstream from where this heavy rain occurred.  Hence, as the water recedes in the northern area, some areas of Dayton are sure to get flooded.  One such area is Island MetroPark, which is about 5 minutes from where we live.  We were actually thinking of having Keisha's birthday party there next Saturday.  Based on pictures from the Dayton Daily News and our own experience from driving by, I'm glad we changed the venue to our place.   urlLink Dayton Daily News Photo Gallery: 12 July 2003   urlLink Dayton Daily News Photo Gallery: 13 July 2003  I'm sure there will be more.

       Update on the 'Journey Inside My Mind'   I had appointments with the psychiatrist and therapist this past Thursday.    I've been taking 10 mg of Lexapro, an antidepressant, and 1 to 3 mg of Diazepam, generic for Valium, for anxiety.  I told the doc about all the stuff that's been going on with our family recently.  I believe that most of my depression and anxiety are situational or circumstantial.  For the most part, I said, I believe the medicine is helping.  He asked about how things have been going with me picking at scabs, and I told him that hasn't changed.  He's decided to increase the dosage of Lexapro to 20 mg a day.  I asked him about my feeling tired a lot from the medicine.  He told me that Valium has a long half-life, and that he had prescribed it awhile back because it was less expensive.  Now that our family is on CareSource, he said, perhaps I could try a different one with a shorter half-life.  Not at this time.  But, the big development... I told him about ADHD symptoms I and others in my family have been noticing.  I explained to him how my previous doctor came up with the diagnosis - there was a standardized, self-assessment test that I took (I don't remember the exact name; perhaps it's in the journal archives for January or February 2002).  Based on how I scored, my doctor at that time diagnosed me with ADHD and prescribed Adderall for me.  I told my current doc that it had worked for me, and he decided to get me started on it again.  Psychology and psychiatry are not exact sciences.  It's not like when you go to your family doctor, and he or she examines your ears, nose, throat, and says, "Aha!  You have a sinus infection.  Here's this antibiotic that should clear it up after a few days."  I guess realizing this difference helps me to have a bit more patience (no pun intended).

       Birthday Preview: Invites, Presents, and Giving Back   Keisha will be 6 years old this Thursday, July 17th.  She was also born on a Thursday.  I'm reminded that, every 6 years, the date and the day of the week are the same.  This phenomenon makes sense when you consider that there is a leap year during that time; otherwise it would be 7 years.  We've been planning a party for next Saturday, the 19th.  It will be a " urlLink Spy Kids 2 " movie party.  Ever since  urlLink Keisha and I went to see the movie at the theatre back in January , she's talked about having a "Spy Kids" birthday party.  Keisha's inviting friends from school and from church.  She's got a terrific memory.  The bus that would pick her and her schoolmates up for preschool would stop directly in front of the kids' homes.  She's been wanting to invite a boy named Vernon, but we didn't know exactly where he lived.  Keisha knew where he lived, so today we drove to the apartment complex, and she pointed out his apartment building.  No one was home, so I left a note, indicating that Keisha was inviting him to her birthday party and to call us for more information.  She also wants to invite her former teacher, Miss Jean.  Jennie has printed up tickets for the kids to have, and she bought the DVD from Wal*Mart last week.  She'd never seen it, so we'd planned for her to watch it before the birthday party so that she could have a clearer idea of what it was about.  We agreed that Keisha could get the movie today, and we all could watch it tonight.  Here's how I went about doing it.  We originally planned to preview without her knowing about it, so I unwrapped the DVD and placed it high on the bookshelf, inside a boardgame box lid.  We told her that she could have one of her birthday presents tonight, but she'd have to find it.  So, I led her outside, in various rooms of the house, to search for this present.  We even gave her a hint by describing what shape and size it was, but we didn't tell her it was the movie.  I knew that she would not be able to find out where I'd originally hid the movie without some intervention.  When she went to the laundry room to look, I took it from its hiding place and put it atop of her bookshelf, which is situated close to the stairs.  She returned from the laundry room, stating that she couldn't find it.  I told her that maybe it was upstairs, and we headed up the stairs.  I hesitated and turned back to her bookshelf.  "Did we look everywhere down here, Keisha?"  She saw where I was looking and this excited, giggle-happy expression came over her face.  I handed her the DVD, and we went upstairs to watch the movie.  After the movie, while I was watching the special features (a ritual I always have to perform when watching a DVD for the first time), Keisha came to me and said that she'd made a card for me.  She told me I'd need to find it.  It was basically going to be a similar hide-and-seek game like we played when she found her movie.  Imagine my surprise to find that she'd made, not just one, but TWO cards for me!  God has truly given us a gift in Keisha.

       Wings and Brewskies!   Tonight our family(Mom, Jennie, Keisha, and I) went to B.C. Rooster's just up the Main Street for some wings.  The three of us adults each had a Killian's, while Keisha sipped from a ROOT beer.  We ordered our usual 10 garlic- and 10 donkey-flavored, but instead of barbeque we ordered teryaki-flavored.  Donkey, by the way, is like three levels lower than the hottest.  In addition to the wings and beer, we had celery and bleu cheese.  Keisha ordered her mini corn dog meal, which included french fries.  Then, about an hour later, I headed to Middletown, Ohio, just south on I-75, to the Fricker's.  A good friend and brother in Christ is getting married on Sunday, and we had his groom-honoring/bachelor party there.  More wings and beer.  This time it was a Bud Light.  Lots of fun, and the Cincinnati Reds won!  Whoo hoo!

       The Listeners Make the Playlists   I just completed another music survey for  urlLink K99.1 FM .  This is the third time this year that I've done it.  It's interesting how they are introducing new songs and playing older songs.  I used to work for the  urlLink Institute for Policy Research at the University of Cincinnati , conducting telephone surveys.  I was intrigued by how the questions were worded.  My nature in taking these and other surveys tends to wondering why I'm being asked the particular question, and wondering how my response will affect the decisions those using the results will make.

Also included is information on housing topics: for example, presence of refrigerators, microwaves and air-conditioning; number of rooms; housing deficiencies. Dayton-Springfield was not on the list.  Neither was the Greater Cincinnati area.

       Mind Change   I decided yesterday that I really needed a mind change.  I was feeling so much angst, which you could probably tell from yesterday's post.  So I decided to spend some time in my Bible.  First, I read through the story of Joseph, in the book of Genesis.  Next I read through the first few chapters of Judges.  Then, I realized that what I really needed was the encouragment found in Romans 8.  The entire chapter is very encouraging, because there are several different thoughts conveyed there.  As I read through the chapter, I stopped when I found  urlLink verse 18 : I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. I began to meditate on the "future glory," and that helped me to get a little bit more perspective.  Also, it's been hard to pray about this.  There is so much going on that I often don't know what specifically to pray.  Then I read  urlLink this passage : In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express.  And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God's will. So that helped, too.  After this, I read through a number of the Psalms, and I noted that the recurring theme of "waiting for God" was present.  How hard it is to wait!  I feel like I've been waiting for so long for things to get better.  To some extent, they have; but, in another sense, they haven't.  I find myself asking, "How much longer do I have to wait, Lord?"  I guess I also have been struggling with this concept of entitlement.  I feel that I should be entitled to have a good credit rating, that I should have a successful job, that I should be able to pay all my bills on time, that I should be able to pay on our mortgage and not lose our house.  But God never promises any of that.  I'm realizing that, the only thing I need is Him.  I get to have my wife, daughter, and mom live with me.  We have food, shelter, clothing.  All of these other things that are typical in our Western lifestyle are not guaranteed by God.  He is also showing how easily he can take all of it away.  It's revealing much about where  urlLink my heart is , to say the least: For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.   I remember, as a young Christian, praying to God, "Give me more faith!" along with other things.  At the time, I just wanted a more godly character.  I had no idea that God would answer my prayers in this manner.  Would I have still prayed the same prayers?  Probably.  I'm reminded of a song I wrote back then, based on struggles I was going through.  It still applies.  It's called " urlLink Tough Enough To Bend ."

       Why We Love Kids    These little snippets come forwarded by  urlLink Mom  via email from  urlLink Karen  (Thanks!)   NUDITY  I was driving with my three young children one warm summer evening when a woman in the convertible ahead of us stood up and waved. She was stark naked! As I was reeling from the shock, I heard my 5-year-old shout from the back seat, "Mom! That lady isn't wearing a seat belt!"     HONESTY   My son Zachary, 4, came screaming out of the bathroom to tell me he'd dropped his toothbrush in the toilet. So I fished it out and threw it in the garbage. Zachary stood there thinking for a moment, then ran to my bathroom and came out with my toothbrush. He held it up and said with a charming little smile, "We better throw this one out too then, 'cause it fell in the toilet a few days ago.     OPINIONS   On the first day of school, a first-grader handed his teacher a note from his mother. The note read, "The opinions expressed by this child are not necessarily those of his parents."    KETCHUP   A woman was trying hard to get the ketchup to come out of the jar. During her struggle the phone rang so she asked her 4-year-old daughter to answer the phone. "It's the minister, Mommy," the child said to her mother. Then she added, "Mommy can't come to the phone to talk to you right now. She's hitting the bottle."     MORE NUDITY   A little boy got lost at the YMCA and found himself in the women's locker room. When he was spotted, the room burst into shrieks, with ladies grabbing towels and running for cover. The little boy watched in amazement and then asked, "What's the matter haven't you ever seen a little boy before?"     POLICE # 1   While taking a routine vandalism report at an elementary school, I was interrupted by a little girl about 6 years old. Looking up and down at my uniform, she asked, "Are you a cop?" "Yes," I answered and continued writing the report. "My mother said if I ever needed help I should ask the police. Is that right?" "Yes, that's right," I told her. "Well, then," she said as she extended her foot toward me, "would you please tie my shoe?"     POLICE # 2   It was the end of the day when I parked my police van in front of the station. As I gathered my equipment, my K-9 partner, Jake, was barking, and I saw a little boy staring in at me. "Is that a dog you got back there?" he asked. "It sure is," I replied. Puzzled, the boy looked at me and then the back of the van. Finally he said, "What'd he do?"    ELDERLY   While working for an organization that delivers lunches to elderly shut-ins, I used to take my 4-year-old daughter on my afternoon rounds. She was unfailingly intrigued by the various appliances of old age, particularly the canes, walkers and wheelchairs. One day I found her staring at a pair of false teeth soaking in a glass. As I braced myself for the inevitable barrage of questions, she merely turned and whispered, "The tooth fairy will never believe this!"     DRESS-UP   A little girl was watching her parents dress for a party. When she saw her dad donning his tuxedo, she warned, "Daddy, you shouldn't wear that suit." "And why not, darling?" "You know that it always gives you a headache the next morning."     DEATH   While walking along the sidewalk in front of his church, our minister heard the intoning of a prayer that nearly made his collar wilt. Apparently, his 5-year-old son and his playmates had found a dead robin. Feeling that proper burial should be performed, they had secured a small box and cotton batting, then dug a hole and made ready for the disposal of the deceased. The minister's son was chosen to say the appropriate prayers and with sonorous dignity intoned his version of what he thought his father always said: "Glory be unto the Faaaather, and unto the Sonnn ..... and into the hole he gooooes."   SCHOOL   A little girl had just finished her first week of school. "I'm just wasting my time," she said to her mother. "I can't read, I can't write and they won't let me talk!"     BIBLE   A little boy opened the big family bible. He was fascinated as he fingered through the old pages. Suddenly, something fell out of the Bible. He picked up the object and looked at it. What he saw was an old leaf that had been pressed in between the pages.   "Mama, look what I found", the boy called out.   "What have you got there, dear?" With astonishment in the young boy's voice, he answered, "I think it's Adam's underwear.

       Frustration.  Despair.  Anger.  Bitterness.  Impatience. Hopelessness.  Faithlessness.   So, how is your day going?  I'm not liking my circumstances one bit, and I'm impatient for the things that are beyond my control to change.  Here are some related posts to other journals:   urlLink The Check Was Not In The Mail   urlLink Why The Check Was Not In The Mail   urlLink Letters to God for 08 July 2003   One thing I've realized is that, by having no money, I feel powerless to do stuff.  That's what an income is.  You have purchasing power: power to pay bills, put gas in the car, grab a cup of coffee with someone, and so on.  I'm struggling with this form of greed, I suppose.  I've felt down nearly the entire day, and I couldn't get to sleep last night, even though I retired early.  I wound up heading upstairs and falling asleep on one of the couches up there.  I've been taking my Lexapro and Valium.  I am so glad I have psychiatrist and therapist appointments this Thursday.  I'm going to go spend some time in my Bible.  I don't even feel like going to church tonight.  Pray for me.

       Cincy Trip Recap   I forgot to mention that one of the highlights of  urlLink Sunday's picnic  was that I got to go to the re-opened rest area just north of exit 29 on Interstate 75.  This rest area had been closed for a very long time, probably about three years.  The  urlLink Ohio Department of Transportation  completely redid it.  It looks good, too.  A lot more room for tractor trailers to park and stay overnight.  Two bathrooms for men, two for the women, and one family bathroom.  I also took a couple pictures related to the  urlLink 26 pictures project .  As we were driving along I-75 just south of downtown Dayton, the tool rental place had a crane dangling a U.S. flag in the wind.  I pulled off to the side of the highway and took the shot.  I caught the picture just as a car was breezing by.  Hopefully it will be a cool mixture of the flag blowing and the blur of the car.  Another thing... we stopped by a Kroger store in the Cincinnati area to pick up an apartment guide, which means that we're considering moving back to Cincinnati.  I've lived here in Dayton for almost 9 years, so it will be a little hard to leave, if it comes to that.

       Downtowning It   Mom and I are downtown this morning at the main branch of the  urlLink Dayton Metro Library .  Within the last few minutes, the skies have darkened and a huge cloudburst has occurred.  We hear the loud rumbles of thunder and the pelting of rain against the windows.  It looks like it's night outside.  We had planned to go feed the parking meter in about 10 minutes, but I think I'll wait to see if the weather simmers down.

       I'm Missing Part of My Body   I have misplaced my day planner, which I tend to rely upon to bring some order to the otherwise chaotic life I lead.  I realized this yesterday evening while at church, as we began to receive announcements about upcoming events.  This morning I looked upstairs and down, and I looked inside Mom's car, which I drove to work on Monday.  No luck.  Perhaps it's inside our car, which Jennie used to drive herself to work this morning.  Or, maybe I accidentally left it at work.  Whatever the case, it feels like a part of my body is missing.

       Bark in the Park!  taken directly from the  urlLink Ohio Basset Rescue Events Page  We would like to invite you to a dog event in the Miami Valley / Dayton area. On Saturday, September 27, the Second Annual Bark in the Park: A Festival for Dogs and the People They Own, will take place at the lovely Delco Park in the city of Kettering, Ohio.  Bark in the Park officially opens at 11:00am until 4:00pm (rain or shine) at Delco Park with free admission for dogs and families. Contests for everyday dogs and their owners, demonstrations, snacks for canines and humans, pet care seminars, and a “Flea Market” featuring products and services for canines are all planned.  At last years 2002 Bark in the Park, a little pup dressed as Raggedy-Ann trotted away with the top honors from the Costume Contest (also our most popular contest)! Dorothy and toto stopped by to accept first prize in the Celebrity Dog Look-Alike Contest, and the top dog in the Frisbee Contest nabbed the disc at 138 feet! The crowd at the Walker Auto Group Stage went wild for the Fashion Show, while the Cricket Green Poodle relaxed on the green Cricket Couch! I cannot remember when last year's Bark in the Park was, but I do remember blogging about it.  Maybe June or August of last year?

       And All That Jazz!   I saw the movie "Chicago" today for the first time.  Jennie bought it on DVD last Saturday, and, since I had the day off, I saw it, along with the extra features.  Catherine Zeta-Jones, Rene Zelleweger, Queen Latifah, and Richard Gere all have tremendous talent!  I have the song "All That Jazz" going through my head right now.  Not so much of a bad thing, except that those words are the only ones I remember! :)  I'll get something else in there soon, though.

       Long-Distance Email   I've mentioned my friend and brother in Christ, Steve, before.  He's on the tail end of a 90-day stint in Biloxi, Mississippi, being retooled for his work in the USAF.  He recently sent me an update: Hello all,  I know that it has been at least two weeks since I have e-mailed people but have been PS2 addicted and passing the time with playing games and other things here in Biloxi.  My last block test was about a week and a half ago, I got a 97 on that test, again, a stupid on my part negated me to get a 100.  Well, I need some help.  If all of you could say a prayer for me for the next block test on Tuesday I would really appreciate it.  I do not feel very comfy with the information.  Things are starting to run together and getting harder to understand.  It is all new info for me so I am having to work harder.  Spent tonight working with XML editor to help build questions for this block to study for (who said that hardware networking people don't use software?).   Should be done tomorrow, so will have the next 4 days to study like everyone else.  Went out with about 12 people for lunch tonight at a mexican resturaunt called Cucos.  Really good food, great heart burn.  A bunch of us are thinking about going fishing the last weekend that we are here.  More to come with that.  The laptop got struck with that MSblast virus, luckily the laptop survived, but will have to reload it, it's acting really screwy.  Should be fun.  Well time for bed, so have a good day.  Take care and God Bless Steve

       More Library Blogging   Long time, no blogging.  I'm at the library with Mom.  It's been a long time since I've been on the Internet, so I'm here checking email along with the other stuff.  Let's see... 38 new messages in the Inbox... 105 new messages in the Bulk folder.  I guess folks would like to keep in touch.  I bet a lot of these are spam.  I'm banking that most of the messages, if not all, in the Bulk folder are.  Be right back.

       Library Blogging   I took the home PC to be serviced yesterday.  The technician said it would be about 2 to 3 days before they could look at it and do the work.  So, I'm still at the library, checking email, blogging, etc., in my one-hour timeframe.  Today Keisha is off school, so she's around here somewhere.  I need to get off soon so that I can see whether she's tearing the place up.  I've updated my reading list.  I've been doing a lot more of that, since I haven't had the computer available at home.  I suppose that's a good thing, isn't it?  I miss not being able to catch up with all the folks on my blogroll, though.

        urlLink Phone Warrior    I heard this guy on the Bob and Tom Morning Show some time ago, and I need to see if the library has any of his CDs available. [His first CD,   urlLink Revenge on the Telemarketers  ] contains an especially memorable bit in which a burial plot salesman calls and Mabe announces he’s about to kill himself. After a few meager attempts to get him help, the salesman asks, “If I got the paperwork out to you this afternoon, do you think you could maybe hold off until tomorrow?” This guy is my hero.

       Call for Officials!   Okay, gentle readers... Here's the deal.  I want you to become an "Official" of this weblog.  There is no real responsibility for the office you will hold, except that you stop by once in awhile, which you probably do already.  You get to choose the office you wish to hold, unless it has already been taken by someone else.  For example,  urlLink Mark Morris is the Official Iowan .  Today, I am pleased to announce the naming of two additional Officials.  Today I name my  urlLink Mom  the  urlLink Official Mom of Journey Inside My Mind  because she's my  urlLink Mom  :D.   urlLink IreneQ  asked me to pick an office for her to hold, so I've come up with something that I think will fit nicely: the  urlLink Official Introspectional Blogger .  If you read her blog with any frequency, then you'll understand.  So, let's hear it for the Officials!   urlLink Official Iowan   urlLink Official Blogger of Introspection   urlLink Official Mom

       Super-Encouraging Sunday Service   Yesterday at church, two of the members who gave the message mentioned me as a great example of encouragement to them personally and to the church as a whole.  I don't know what to do when this happens, except to thank them and try to be humble.  They approached me before service to ask me for some jokes to tell as part of their message.  I'm encouraged that they are encouraged!  Also, things have been going well at work.  We have a new head chef, who is making some needed changes in how the restaurant is run.  As I left work yesterday, I praised God.  "People lift me up as an example of encouragement, but what I do pales in comparison to what you do.  God, you are the Super Encourager!"

       Our Dog Jake   ... really needs to get neutered.  We have concluded that he does not care whether the other dog is male or female:  he is still "interested" (nice euphemism, huh?).    Like this morning, after Keisha left for school.  I took Jake for a little walk without a leash in the little cul de sac area where we live.  I'm glad I spotted the male poodle with his owner first and grabbed Jake's collar to hold on to him.  The poodle's owner mentioned that the poodle prefers male dogs to female.  I was slightly relieved to discover that Jake is not alone in his preference for dogs of the same sex.  Last Saturday we took him to my Dad's farm in Indiana, and he met Icky, short for Ichabod, who is a dog old enough to be Jake's grandfather.  Let's just say that Icky made it very clear up front that he was not interested.  It was fun to watch the two of them interact.  As Jake would get close to Icky, Icky would growl and start to chase after Jake.  Jake, the much younger and faster dog, would get away unscathed, yet with his tail between his legs nevertheless.  Then, as I walked Jake around the farm, Icky followed.  As Jake would "mark" his spots around the farm, Icky would follow up with "marks" of his own.  While we humans were chatting, Jake and Icky would take turns marking the firewood pile, for example.  Silly dog.

       Biblical Confirmation on Coffee?   From an email forum to which I subscribe: A man and his wife were having an argument about who should brew the coffee each morning.   The wife said, "You should do it, because you get up first, and then we don't have to wait as long to get our coffee."   The husband said, " You are in charge of the cooking around here, and you should do it, because that is your job, and I can just wait for my coffee."   The wife replied, "No you should do it, and besides it is in the Bible that the man should do the coffee."   The husband replied, " I can't believe that.  Show me."   So she fetched the Bible, opened the New Testament, and showed him at the top of several pages, that it indeed says:  "HEBREWS"

       Library Blogging   Greetings from the Northtown-Shiloh branch of the  urlLink Dayton Metro Library .  I'm going to take our home computer to be serviced.  I hope that they can get the computer to at least the state it was when we first bought it in December 1999.  Wow.  December 1999.  That's a lot of software updates ago.  Once we get the computer home and get the Internet software loaded again, I'll be spending some time downloading the updates.  I can't think of much left to say in this particular post right now, so I guess I'll just stop.

       Darwin Awards   In case you have been waiting breathlessly for this year's Darwin Awards, here they are. The awards this year are, once again, truly classic.  These awards are given each year to bestow upon (the remains of) that individual, who through single-minded self-sacrifice, has done the most to remove undesirable elements from the human gene pool. Just think... until these events, these same people were walking the streets like normal people.   5th RUNNER-UP   Goes to a San Anselmo, California man who died when he hit a lift tower at the Mammoth Mountain ski area while riding down the slope on a foam pad. The 22-year old David Hubal was pronounced dead at Central Mammoth Hospital. The accident occurred about 3 a.m., the Mono County Sheriff's department said. Hubal and his friends apparently had hiked up a ski run called Stump alley and undid some yellow foam protectors from lift towers, said Lt. Mike Donnelly of the Mammoth Lakes Police Department. The pads are used to protect skiers who might hit towers.  The group apparently used the pads to slide down the ski slope and Hubal crashed into a tower. It has since been investigated and determined the tower he hit was the one with its pad removed.   4th RUNNER-UP   Goes to Robert Puelo, 32, was apparently being disorderly in a St. Louis market. When the clerk threatened to call the police, Puelo grabbed a hot dog, shoved it into his mouth and walked out without paying. Police found him unconscious in front of the store. Paramedics removed the six-inch wiener from his throat where it had choked him to death.   3rd RUNNER-UP   Goes to poacher Marino Malerba of Spain, who shot a stag standing above him on an overhanging rock and was killed instantly when it fell on him.   2nd RUNNER-UP   "Man loses face at party." A man at a West Virginia party (probably related to the winner last year, a man in Arkansas who used the .22 bullet to replace the fuse in his pickup truck) popped a blasting cap into his mouth and bit down, triggering an explosion that blew off hi lips, teeth, and tongue. Jerry Stromyer, 24, of Kincaid, bit the blasting cap as a prank during the party late Tuesday night, said Cpl. M.D. Payne. "Another man had it in an aquarium hooked to a battery and was trying to explode it." "It wouldn't go off and this guy said I'll show you how to set it off." He put it into his mouth, bit down and it blew all his teeth out and his lips and tongue off, Payne said. Stromyer was listed in guarded condition Wednesday with extensive facial injuries, according to a spokesperson at Charleston Area Medical Division. "I just can't imagine anyone doing something like that," Payne said.   1st RUNNER-UP   Doctors at Portland University Hospital said an Oregonman shot through the skull by a hunting arrow is lucky to be alive and will be released soon from the hospital. Tony Roberts, 25, lost his right eye last weekend during an initiation into a men's rafting club, Mountain Men Anonymous (probably known now as Stupid Mountain Men Anonymous) in Grants Pass, Oregon. A friend tried to shoot a beer can off his head, but the arrow entered Robert's right eye. Doctors said that had the arrow gone 1 millimeter to the left, a major blood vessel would have been cut and Roberts would have died instantly. Neurosurgeon Doctor Johnny Delashaw at the University Hospital in Portland said the arrow went through 8 to 10 inches of brain with the tip protruding at the rear of his skull, yet somehow managed to miss all major blood vessels. Delashaw also said that had Roberts tried to pull the arrow out on his own he surely would have killed himself.  Roberts admitted afterwards that he and his friends had been drinking that afternoon. Said Roberts, I feel so dumb about this." No charges have been filed, but the Josephine County district attorney's office said the initiation stunt is under investigation.   Now, THIS YEAR'S WINNER   (The late) John Pernicky and his friend, (the late) Sal Hawkins, of the great state of Washington, decided to attend a local Metallica concert at the George Washington amphitheater. Having no tickets (but having had 18 beers between them), they thought it would be easy to "hop" over the nine foot fence and sneak into the show.  They pulled their pickup truck over to the fence and the plan was for Mr. Pernicky, who was 100 pounds heavier than Mr. Hawkins) to hop the fence and then assist his friend over. Unfortunate for (the late) Mr. Pernicky, there was a 30-foot drop on the other side of the fence.  Having heaved himself over, he found himself crashing through a tree. His fall was abruptly halted (and broken, along with his arm) by a large branch that snagged him by his shorts. Dangling from the tree with a broken arm, he looked down and saw some bushes below him. Possibly figuring the bushes would break his fall, he removed his pocket knife and proceeded to cut away his shorts to free himself from the tree.  Finally free, Mr. Pernicky crashed into holly bushes. The sharp leaves scratched his ENTIRE body and now, without the protection of his shorts, a holly branch penetrated his rectum. To make matters worse, on landing his pocket knife penetrated his thigh.  Hawkins, seeing his friend in considerable pain and agony, threw him a rope and tried to pull him to safety by tying the rope to the pickup truck and slowly driving away. However, in his drunken haste/state, he put the truck into reverse and crashed through the fence landing on his friend and killing him. Police arrived to find the crashed pickup with its driver thrown 100 feet from the truck and dead at the scene from massive internal injuries.  Upon moving the truck, they found John under it half-naked, scratches on his body, a holly stick in his rectum, a knife in his thigh, and his shorts dangling from a tree branch 25 feet in the air.  Congratulations gentlemen, you win...   Accuracy of the information contained within this post is unknown, but the stories are, in a way, entertaining anyhow. - DAJ

       Where Have I Been?   Last Wednesday, August 6th, the hard drive on our home computer crashed.  Since then, I've been working on backing up what we can salvage before we replace the hard drive.  Also, I've learned that, unless I can shrink my hands and tools, I am not able to replace the hard drive myself.  Even though I tried.  I'm learning a lesson from the school of hard-knocks about backing up.  Fortunately, some stuff has already been backed up, either online or onto discs or diskettes.  I'm at the library branch close to home right now, checking email as I blog.  Fortunately, most of it is spam that I can bulk delete.  But there is a lot of it!  I've also been working a little at my new job and catching up on some reading.  What have you been up to?  Oh yeah, I can read your blog to find out, huh? :)

        urlLink Who's 'So Vain'?    Carly Simon is about to divulge the subject of her 1972 song, "You're So Vain."  Unfortunately, only one man will know, and he doesn't appear willing to share the secret.  Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC sports and NBC Olympics, won the information in a recent charity auction to benefit Martha's Vineyard Community Services, which provides child care, counseling, substance abuse treatment services and visiting nurses to the community. Ebersol said Simon gave him one clue about the man's identity that she said he could reveal: He has the letter "e" in his name.   That could be any of the chief suspects: actor Warren Beatty, whom Simon dated; Mick Jagger, who sang backup on the song; and her ex-husband, James Taylor.   Ebersol said he was happy to put up the cash for a secret he can't tell.   "It's a great cause and I wanted to make sure Carly didn't have to tell a total stranger," Ebersol said.

       Tired   I got home from work a little after 1 AM this morning.  I've heard of a process called "work hardening," and I think I'm going through it right now.  New shift, new activity, and so forth.  I enjoy what I do, and I look forward to doing it better.  I like being new in that the customers give me a little bit of grace, and when I do something great, they really appreciate it.  I'm off until this Thursday, and I look forward to talking with the woman who hired me about getting onto a set schedule.  I'm still feeling tired, and I look forward to heading to bed soon.

       I'm a funny guy!   I just came back from work.  I thought I was supposed to be there at 11 AM, which was when I went in yesterday.  A couple hours into the shift, I asked the server manager how to contact the woman who hired me, just to verify that I was supposed to be there.  I found out that I'm not supposed to go in until 4PM today.  You know, that makes sense.  When have you ever heard of a hotel bar open for lunch on Monday?

        urlLink Electronic glove aims to translate ASL to speech    This is a fascinating article about a fascinating, experimental technology.  Just as with cochlear implants, it's adding to the debate in the deaf community over whether a deaf person should take steps toward hearing and being able to communicate with the hearing community.  It's touchy because many in the deaf community view their use of ASL as an intrinsic part of their culture.  These individuals do not see their deafness as an impediment.

       Bookworm   Mom's kept the computer chair warm for me today, leaving me to finishing the book   urlLink Sleepers  , which I only bought last week at a used bookstore for $0.50.  I started reading it yesterday morning after Keisha's bus came to take her to school.  It was hard to put it down, and I was much more pleased that it ended somewhat happily.  I do not recommend it for the faint of heart.  The author, Lorenzo Carcaterra, is very graphic in his depiction of the horrific events that occurred at the Wilkinson School for Boys.  I've been distracted from reading other books on my reading list until I'd finished this one.  Now I want to see the movie again.  I haven't touched   urlLink Angela's Ashes   in several days, but I noticed yesterday that I'm about halfway through it.  I appreciate Frank McCourt's keen sense of observation, even at an early age.  I was really encouraged today to find a book that  urlLink Kathryn Lively  had sent me.  You may already be aware of  urlLink my penchant for quotations .  This book is one that  urlLink was sent to her for review recently .

       "It's not good-bye; it's good  journey ."   That's one of the many things I said to  urlLink my mom  before she got on the bus to head back to Texas on Monday afternoon.  Even now, at 4:45 AM, when she is probably in Tennessee somewhere, I recall the moment so vividly.  And with tears.  Aside from my own family (Jennie and Keisha), I am the closest to my mom.  I remember  urlLink when she arrived at our home on Sunday, October 27, 2002 .  Wow.  She lived with us for 11 months.  I often wonder why we cry during these times of parting.  I remember the first time my sister and I were heading back home after spending a Christmas break with my mom and family in Texas.  She was the more emotional among all of us then.  But I let the tears flow on Monday afternoon.  Keisha has still been on her fall intercession, so she was with me.  I could tell she felt very sad, but she didn't cry like mom and me.  I kept telling her that it was okay to cry, though.  I guess I cry because I know I won't be able to see my mom, whom I love so very dearly, for a long time.  I won't be able to stop by her room upstairs and chat about what happened at work, or life in general.  She won't be joining us any more for family dinners.  She won't be teasing Keisha around the house any more.  I miss these things already.  At the same time, we're almost out of this house.  We closed the short-sale on Friday, and we're moving this coming weekend.  Almost two and a half years' worth of memories have been accumulated, and I find it heart-wrenching to have to deal with the change.  To be true, I've been in denial for so long.  I guess you could say that I'm grieving the change that's gone on in our family.  Jennie has helped me to get to the point where I'm able to accept what's happening, and I lover her all the more for it.  With all the financial trouble we've been in this year, the one thing that was constant was that we had this house.  It's been comfortable to live here.  I guess it's been too comfortable.  Similarly, mine and Jennie's lives have changed.  When we first moved into this place, I had a job as an IT consultant, making enough money so that Jennie didn't have to work and could stay home with Keisha.  Now, Jennie works during the day as a nurse's aide, and I'm a bartender, working days and nights.  Our income is not what it was when we first moved into the house either.  Well, change is gonna do us good.  I'm glad to be moving into an apartment.  Owning a house was just too much for us to handle, and we've learned a lot about the real estate market in this area, too.  I'm praying that we'll find neighbors that can become our best friends and for Keisha to find someone her age with whom she can play.  We'll see how things turn out in the next few weeks.  By then, this transition will be complete, for the most part.

       While I Was Out   I see that, while I've been away from blogging, that George Plimpton and Robert Palmer have passed away.  I fondly remember George Plimpton as the host of Masterpiece Theatre on TV growing up.  And, as a child of the '80's, I came to enjoy the music of Robert Palmer: Addicted to Love, Bad Case of Lovin' You, and, of course, his work with The Power Station.  Both will be missed, I'm sure.

       From Wired to Tired   So, here I am.  It's about 4:15 AM EDT.  I've been home from work for about 45 minutes, and Jennie gets up for work in about 45 minutes.  This usually happens when I close the bar.  Tonight was no exception.  Actually, tonight wasn't that bad, in terms of its hectic-ness.  We did a bunch of liquor sales, but they mostly consisted of highball-type drinks (e.g., gin and tonic, bourbon and coke, etc.) that were easy to make.  I had to shoo people out of the bar at about ten 'til 2 so that I could finish cleaning and closing down.  After I left, I stopped at the convenience store and bought a quart of double chocolate milk.  Then I drove to the Taco Bell and gave the drive-thru attendant a hard time. "Have I reached the border?" I asked.  "You've reached Taco Bell," he replied.  I noticed the sign said, "Think outside the bun."  So I said, "I'm thinking outside the bun tonight."  Then I placed my order, letting the attendant know I was just kidding.  "Don't spit in my food, okay?" I said.  "It's too late," he replied jokingly. After getting my food, I continued the drive home.  I've noticed that my most creative moments happen during this time, but unfortunately, I'm not able to record them.  A lot of the ideas revolve around fictional crime scenes, ideas for potential stories, and the like.  So I came home, sat down at the computer, and played solitaire, minesweeper, and freecell.  Then I decided to connect to the 'net.

       Transitions: Away We Are Going!   We put a deposit down on our new apartment, which is relatively close to where we live now.  This is good news in that we'll be able to keep Keisha in the same school.  They've done a lot to help accommodate her special needs. We got a phone call on Thursday night from our realtor.  Apparently we're closing the sale of our house at 11:30 AM Friday morning.  Hopefully, we'll have some more time to finish packing and clean up before we leave this house.  urlLink Mom  is moving back to Texas this coming Monday.  Keisha and I will be taking her to the Greyhound bus station on Monday at Noon.

       That Which I Do Not Want To Do, I Do   I've done exactly what I said I wasn't going to do.  It's now ten minutes until Jennie wakes up to get ready for work, and I have yet to go to bed.  I've been on the computer: blogging, checking emails, etc.  On my way home from work, I told myself that I wasn't going to spend any time on the computer; just a few minutes maybe to get some chillout music going.  I couldn't resist.  It's not that I've had a burning desire to write anything in particular.  I guess I'm used to this routine of checking out my fellow bloggers in cyberspace and cleaning out my email accounts.  I'm going to hate having to wake up.  Maybe Keisha will let me take a nap today.

       Do Not Call List Struck Down, Here's What You Can Do   I bet many of you were not counting on this news (I know I wasn't): Just a few days shy of the Oct. 1 effective date for the  urlLink Do Not Call List , a U.S. District Court Judge in Oklahoma struck down the list on the basis that the Federal Trade Commission lacks congressional authority to develop and maintain it.

       A Moment of Inertia, of Sorts    "An object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force." --  urlLink Isaac Newton's First Law of Motion  Keisha and I spent this morning watching  urlLink PBS Kids  on channel 16 here in Dayton.    At 6:30 AM she woke up and came downstairs to watch the yoga program.  At 7 Arthur came on.  At 7:30 it was Clifford the Big Red Dog (whose voice is that of the late John Ritter, in fact).  At 8 AM we watched Dragon Tales.  At 8:30 it was Caillou.  Somehow we both made it through the 9 AM showing of Teletubbies.  Maybe it's because Keisha was waiting for Barney, which came on at 9:30.  At 10 AM Sesame Street came on.  At 11 there were two instructional programs: the first was one about drawing with crayons without lines showing the border of objects.  The second one was a physics professor, who taught us about inertia (that whole "a body at rest wants to remain at rest" thing).  At 11:30 Between the Lions, one of my current favorites, came on.  I like it because it teaches reading in a really fun way.  Today the focus was on the short "a" sound.  At noon I decided that Keisha and I needed to get going with the rest of our day.

       I Can Only Imagine Something Like This   This afternoon a gentleman came to the bar and had a beer.  He watched the Cincinnati Bengals lose to the Pittsburgh Steelers for a little bit, and then he left.  As I cleaned up his empty beer can, I noticed a crumpled up piece of paper.  I opened it and saw that it was an ATM withdrawal slip.  Apparently, he had made a withdrawal from his savings account.  Fortunately for him, only the last 4 digits of his account displayed.  But then I saw the balance in his savings account: over $27,000!  I have never had that much money saved up before.  That would be a good item to include in a story.  Where did he get that money from?  Is he just a penny-pincher, or is there something shady going on in his life?

       Some Things Haven't Changed   After Keisha was born, I followed her into the transitional nursery, videotaping the happenings with her during her first minutes.  The transitional nurse, Yvetta, took her temperature, blood pressure, and gave her a bath.  Keisha did not like getting her hair washed!  Not one bit!  More than six years later, that's one thing that hasn't changed.  Every time we wash her hair, or even talk about her hair getting washed, she starts moaning.  This, even though we take every precaution possible to avoid irritating her eyes.  Maybe by the time she's a teenager, she'll start appreciating that she can wash her hair.

       "How Low Can You Go?"   This line from the song "Limbo Rock" describes something I did back in college.  One of my professors was a huge fan of our football team, and his class was one of the hardest I'd taken at the time.  It was so hard, and I was so desperate to get a passing grade for his class.  On the day of our exam, I wore red and black, the colors of our school, and a couple homemade signs showing my school spirit.  As he came by to hand me my test, he commented, "You are one sick person."  I'm reminded of this because this morning, we're going to look at potential apartments and fill out applications.  Afterward, I'm heading to work.  Hence, I'm putting on my scarlet and gray jersey, since the Ohio State Buckeyes will be playing.  Most of the folks that live around here are big fans of the Buckeyes, and I figure that I might be able to score some brownie points with the rental office by showing off my spirit.

       Staying True to My Tagline    "My dreams are weirder than yours"   Yesterday I dreamt that Darth Vader and his Imperial cohorts were after me.  I and someone else tried to hide by climbing onto a "Borg"-like contraption (from Star Trek), but we were eventually caught.  I somehow conviced Darth to come with me to Earth in exchange for not killing me.  So Darth Vader and I went to the park, the grocery store, fast food restaurants.  I had realized that he was my dad because he'd told me so before capturing me.

       Another Long Day   Tonight's drama at the bar was a short-lived spat between two customers who also work together.  That and the Monday Night Football game.  I got home late again, and, for some insane reason, I haven't gone to bed yet.  Fortunately, Jennie is off work on Tuesday (I guess I mean today), and she'll be able to get Keisha ready for school.  That way I can sleep before I need to head into work at 11 AM.  I'll be off Wednesday and Thursday.  In other news, my belt broke yesterday, and I've had to keep my shirt tucked in and pants pulled up high as I've worked the past two evenings.  I plan to go to a Wal-Mart-type place to get an extra pair of working clothes and a new belt.  Cheers!

       A Day With Low Seratonin, A Day With Self-Injury   I guess some may look at the title and be puzzled.  When I recently saw my psychiatrist, he increased the amount of Lexapro I'm to take, so that I'll have more seratonin in my brain, which will help offset the OCD-type symptoms (read: self-injurious behavior, mainly picking at scabs to make them bleed).  These symptoms have been aggravated by the Adderall, which I'm taking for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  I've seen the Adderall help in my ability to focus my attention when and where I want it, but I still haven't stopped the picking behavior.  I regret that I didn't immediately get the prescription filled when I got it over a week ago (Procrastination is classic ADHD behavior, by the way.).  This past Thursday I took the last dose of the medicine from the old prescription, and as of yesterday I still hadn't filled the new prescription.  So I didn't take my Lexapro last night, which means that all day today, I've been without the seratonin to help offset the picking behavior.  So I picked at scabs today.  A lot.  I currently have several on my upper right arm, the outside part that faces those to my right.  They were initially acne-type "things" that I'd tried to "pop."  Eventually I just decided to start scratching.  In addition, I have some scabs on my left leg, just above the ankle but below the calf.  These I got from getting bitten by a mosquito or something.  It is interesting for me to say all of this because it was just a few days ago that I'd remarked to Jennie while we were in the car that I'd been feeling less of a desire to pick at my scabs.  I told her I didn't know if it was the medicine that was working, or if I'd just gotten bored of doing it, or what.  Then today happens.  I'm tempted to be very hateful of myself and to lash out at myself with words.  I realize consciously that that is not effective.  Fortunately for me, Jennie had the prescription filled today, and I've since taken my dose for tonight.  She's also put some vitamin E on the scabs to help them heal.  I usually put hydrogen peroxide on them to help prevent infection, but I noticed this morning that we were out.  Tomorrow is another day, thankfully.

       Practical Joking   Last night, before we went to bed, Jennie and I decided to play a little practical joke on my mom and Keisha.  Keisha had gotten a fake, plastic bug that resembles a cockroach.  Jennie said we could put it on top of the coffee can inside the freezer, so that when Mom would reach for the coffee in the morning, she'd flip out.  This morning, she was surprised, but only for a little bit.  She noticed how it was conveniently placed on top of the coffee can -- too staged.  She initially thought it was Keisha and my idea, but then I took the coffee can, with bug on top, out to the living room to show Keisha.  Keisha was the one who actually flipped out.  I made the can jump so that the "bug" could jump off the can onto the living room couch where Keisha sat.  Let's just say that Keisha did not like it.  That is an understatement.  When I picked it up to show her it was fake, she got angry at me, saying that I'd killed it and it was frozen.  Jennie told her that it would thaw out.  Keisha needs a little bit of time to thaw out, too.  She's having a hard time thinking the whole thing is funny, which actually makes me chuckle more inside. :)

       9-11 Remembered   "Grieving must be done in its own time. To deny the human reality that pain hurts only delays the process."  -- John-Roger, from  urlLink QuotesBlog  I had just arrived to work and was checking in with my manager when I noticed that she was watching the news on the small TV she'd been keeping in her office.  The first plane had crashed into the tower.  We saw the second plane crash.  Later we heard about the Pentagon and the field in Pennsylvania.  It was hard to believe that this was really happening.  Work basically ceased for everyone as we were all glued to the TV, which eventually made its way into a conference room.  I left work early that afternoon to go home to my wife.  On the way I stopped at the United Dairy Farmers to get a special edition of the newspaper.    I watched the President George W. Bush, in a televised address from the Oval Office at 9 PM Eastern Daylight Time on September 11, 2001, in which  urlLink he said : "Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they cannot touch the foundation of America. These acts shatter steel, but they cannot dent the steel of American resolve." For the next several days, the IT folks at work had live streaming footage from CNN.  I rejoiced with those who'd survived and mourned with those who'd mourned.  Last year, I had a few pages of paper with many of the names of the victims.  Other men in our church had the rest of the pages.  I went to the Vietnam Veterans Park in Dayton, across from the Dayton Job Center, and prayed for these victims and their families.  As I prayed for an individual, I tore off the name and threw it into the Great Miami River.  The events of that day have become a defining moment for our lives in the same way that Pearl Harbor, the assassinations of JFK and others, the Challenger and Columbia space shuttles, have.  I am so grateful to God for the many ways he has shown his compassion through these tough times, and I pray for those affected.  On the evening of September 11, 2002, I wrote the following  urlLink 100 words : One year ago today some people sought to shake the foundations upon which we live. They went after those areas of our lives that make us who we are. Families, friends, and communities were attacked.   Yet one year later the principles which have led to this country’s success still stand, and because we are a country built on principles, we still stand as well. Terrorists may cause pain, but they cannot take away the foundation that makes us who we are, that which will always prevail: faith hope, love. And surely we know that the greatest of these is love. The events of two years ago also transformed our perspective on life and generated a renewed sense of patriotism.  The following words  urlLink from the movie  Braveheart   come to mind (emphasis added):  William Wallace:   What will you do without freedom?  Will you fight?   Soldier:  Against  that ? No, we will run, and we will live.   William Wallace:  Aye, fight and you may die. Run, you'll live... at least a while. And dying in your beds, many years from now, wouldn't you be willing to trade all that from this day to that, for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that  they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom ?   May God Bless the United States of America.

       I Really Don't Know What To Say   I got home from work about a half hour ago.  I'm really tired, and yet I'll be getting up in less than 8 hours to head off to church briefly and then to work again.  I'll be working from 10:30 AM til closing time.  I don't know why I offered to take the other bartender's hours; maybe it was because I didn't have many hours this week.  I just don't know how I'm going to make it the entire day.  After about a half hour at work today, a few of us were called to serve at a banquet that took place at the US Air Force Museum.  Apparently five of the temporary banquet workers just walked off the job.  So I got to be a banquet person for most of the evening.  Then, as I took a short break, I and another woman realized that the woman who'd taken us from the hotel to the museum had already left.  I didn't like that at all.  I felt abandoned.  Nevertheless, I wound up heading back with some of the guys transporting the banquet supplies.  This was at about 9:30 PM.  I could have just gone home then.  When I returned to the bar at the restaurant, it was crazy.  People were all crowded around the bar and many were sitting in tables; we were getting slammed.  Two of the servers were behind the bar with the other bartender making drinks and getting into each other's way.  I wished I could have gone home then.  It was so distracting, and I secretly wished for about half the people to leave.  I don't think we were equipped to handle a crowd that size.  Anyhow, it's over for now.  It's good to be home.

       The Journey Inside My Mind   I began taking Adderall again a few months ago for ADHD, Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.  I also borrowed Ed Hallowell's  Driven to Distraction  from the public library.  While at work last week, I saw a commercial about ADHD, sponsored by the folks at WebMD.  That's where I spotted this great article about living with ADHD, " urlLink Tips for Living with ADHD ".  A lot of it is stuff I've heard before, but I tend to be reluctant to put stuff like this into practice.  Repeat until I get it right.  I've mentioned in the past that I self-injure, specifically by picking at scabs on my body.  One side effect of the Adderall is that it complicates these OCD(Obsessive Compulsive Disorder)-type symptoms.  As a result my psychiatrist has increased the dose of Lexapro in order to further increase the amount of Seratonin.

       Our Soon-Not-To-Be-Home, the continuing saga   Thursday night our realtor came over with paperwork for Jennie and I to sign regarding the sale of our house.  It's all just a technicality since it's our mortgage company that agreed to the terms of the short sale with the future owner of our house.  I found it rather easy to sign the paperwork, as a result.  The next steps are some housing inspections, closing at the end of this month, and moving.  Moving.  To our new home, a location to be named later.  Pray for us.

        urlLink Lizard Spit!    When I saw the title of this article, I thought I was surely mistaken, perhaps because of the cold beer I've been drinking.  The beer is Miller Genuine Draft in a 24 ounce can, the equivalent of two 12 ounce bottles, which I might also drink in one sitting.  It's been awhile since I'd had lighter lager beer; my beer of choice has lately been Guinness (the spelling of the name doesn't appear right - maybe it's the beer again).  Back to the article.  I'd heard something about this on TV or the radio last week, but I couldn't find a link on the 'Net to reference in a blog post.  Now I do.  Amylin Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly are developing a drug called exenatide from the venom in the saliva of the Gila monster.  The venom helps to stimulate the lizard's metabolism, and scientists have found that the molecule works in humans, too.

       Our Soon-To-Not-Be-Home   We were informed last week by our realtor that our mortgage company has accepted the offer that was made.  So, soon we'll have to move.  Moving into an apartment from a house.  We need to shed a lot of our possessions.  I'm also wondering about how the four of us (Jennie, Keisha, Mom, and I), along with our dog, can fit into an affordable three-bedroom apartment.  It looks like we'll need to do this in October.  More to come later.

       Tired   After spending a lot of the night and today getting the computer updated, I'm feeling tired.  Sleep has been intermittent, and I have to head to work in about a half hour.  Tonight I'll be closing, which means that I'll be out until late.  I'm glad that there are sites like Windows Update at Microsoft.  I'm also glad that the technicians were able to salvage the data from the old hard drive.  I'm almost finished tweaking the configuration (a few more programs to install, etc.), and soon I'll be able to let the rest of the family use the computer.

Recently she visited her doctor and got a referral to  urlLink DaytonPainMed  because of the constant pain she lives with, and we'll be leaving the library in a bit to go to her first appointment there.  She does a much better job of describing what it's like to live in constant pain in her blog, " urlLink Me, Myself, and I ."  Happy Birthday, Mom.  I love you!

       So Much To Blog About   Yet I've forgotten most of it!  Arrgghh!  I left work this afternoon and went to the local branch of our public library to pick up a movie I'd reserved.  While there I browsed some books and other movies, and checked out some others.  I have added the books to my AllConsuming.net reading list, which I have placed on  urlLink Dan's Domain , my homepage.  This morning I went to see the psychiatrist.  He was out sick so I saw another one.  I got a new prescription for Adderall-XR, and I'll supplement that with the Adderall I've been taking.  I'm still taking Lexapro to get more seratonin in my system.  My boss at work talked with me about some upcoming plans he has for me and for the restaurant.  I'm not comfortable sharing them all right now.  We also discussed a problem I and a coworker had this past Sunday.  I'm off to watch some prime time television and examine my daughter's Trick-or-Treat candy stash.  Oh yeah, and eat dinner.

       Hernia Scar   I remember as a little boy, that I would wake Mom and Dad up on a Saturday morning, for example, by running in and jumping on their bed.  I didn't care if I landed on my Dad or not; in fact, I thought it was an extra bonus if I did.  I bring this up because I've wondered if my daughter Keisha would do something like that.  I'm also more concerned because, when I was little, I had a few hernia operations in my groin area, and lately, I've become more aware of how sensitive the area around the scar is.  I'm acutely aware of this being the weakest area of my body, and I know that a blow to that area would be devastating.

       A Story of Friendship   During the first World War, a soldier in the trenches saw his friend out in no-man's land -- the ground between our trenches and those of the enemy -- stumble and fall in a hail of bullets.  He said to the officer, "May I go, Sir, and bring him in?"  But the officer refused.  "No one can live out there," he said.  "I will only lose you as well."  Disobeying the order, the man went to try to save his friend, for they had been like David and Jonathan throughout the entire war.  Somehow, he got his friend on his shoulder and carried him back to the trenches, but he himself lay mortally wounded, and his friend was dead.  The officer was angry.  "I told you not to go," he said.  "Now I have lost both of you."  With his dying breath, the man said, "But of course it was worth it, Sir."  "Worth it?" asked the officer in disbelief.  "How could it be?  Your friend is dead, and you are mortally wounded."  The boy shrank from the reproach, but, looking up at his officer's face, he said, "It  was  worth it, Sir, because when I got to him, he said, 'I knew you'd come.'"    from a plaque I saw in Linda R.'s bathroom

Not only of them, but also of The Power Station, which had D2 bassist John Taylor and the late Robert Palmer as vocalist.  Last week while driving to work, the local radio station played their version of "Bang A Gong (Get It On)", so I naturally had to crank up the volume.  Of their version and the original by T. Rex, I think I like theirs better.  The original is not bad, though.  Remember the cool video for Bang A Gong?  It was as though the dancer became hyperkinetic or something during the song.

       Some of the More Unusual Drinks I've Made   In response to a  urlLink previous post about  Lynchburg Lemonade  ,  urlLink Carla  asks: I've never had this one before but people say that it's nice...so I've gotta ask you Dan, what are some of the more unusual drinks you've been asked to make?  Hmm... the more  unusual  drinks?   Bend Me Over  is one.  It contains a shot (1 fl. oz.) of  urlLink Crown Royal whiskey , a shot of Amaretto liqueur, and a splash of Sweet & Sour mix.  Another one is something called a  Fired Up Friday .  It contains a shot of Peach Schnapps, a shot of Cranberry Juice, and a small amount of Bacardi 151 rum.  151 is the "proof," which means that it contains 75.5% alcohol by volume.  The bottle actually has a flammable warning and a flame retardant seal.  I poured so many of them one night that I just about gagged from the Peach Schnapps smell.  I love to mix drinks, but I would probably never drink them myself.  One drink that I actually tasted back in bartending school was called a  Red, White, and Blue .  This is a drink that I would love to have again.  Unfortunately, it's not that big.  In a 1 oz. "Pony" glass, you layer Grenadine, White Cr&eacute;me de Cacao, and Blue Curacao by "spoon-floating" each liqueur, respectively, 1/3 of the way into the glass.  I've been aching to make this drink for the military folks that comprise the majority of the guests at the bar where I work.  Right now, I'm waiting for us to get some White Cr&eactut;me de Cacao.  Sometimes, I suggest different drinks to people who may not know exactly what they want.  About a month or so ago, I suggested a  Blue Margarita  to one lady, and she wound up getting her friends to like it as well.  It's made just like a regular Margarita, except that it uses Blue Curacao instead of Triple Sec.  It tastes exactly the same, too.  Only the color is different.  The recipe is 1-1/2 oz of Tequila, 1/2 oz of Blue Curacao, 1/2 oz of Rose's Lime Juice, and 3 oz of Sweet and Sour mix.  I also suggested a  Sloe Screw  to one lady.  It contains 1 oz of Sloe Gin (which tastes like strawberries) and 2 oz. of Orange Juice.  Any drink name that with a sexual connotation has Orange Juice (Screwdriver, Harvey Wallbanger, for example).  More interesting trivia for you to share with your friends.

       Favorite Mixed Drinks   This idea, meme, or whatever you call it, may become a persistent one.  I recently had a Lynchburg Lemonade.  It was very good, especially for someone who doesn't like the overpowering taste of alcohol in what they drink.  Lynchburg Lemonade contains 1 oz. of Jack Daniels, 1/2 oz. of Triple Sec, 3 oz. of Sweet and Sour mix, and 1 oz. of 7-Up or Sprite, topped off after shaking and pouring into a 5 oz. glass.  Garnish with a lemon.

       October is a Wonderful Month, Especially for Cookies   Via the U.S. Newswire: Profile America -- Thursday, Oct. 23 -- October is set aside to recognize many causes and activities -- for instance, it's National Roller Skating Month and National Construction Toy Month. But there's one celebration that pretty well touches everyone, regardless of age, background, or interests -- it's National Cookie Month, recalling the tradition and aroma of fresh baked cookies as a symbol of good times. Whether chocolate chip, peanut butter, or any of the dozens of other recipes, cookies are one of America's favorite treats. While many home cooks still bake their own cookies, there are more than 7-thousand retail bakeries around the country, and cookies make up a good part of their almost 2-billion dollars in annual sales. You can find these and more facts about America from the U.S. Census Bureau on the Web at  urlLink http://www.census.gov . See?  I told you.

      At first I had a hard time believing it was happening.  At work the game was blacked out from the NFL Sunday Ticket because, we think, it was a home game in Cincinnati (only an hour or so away) and it may not have sold out in time.  So we settled for seeing score updates.  Nevertheless, I am excited that the Bengals won in the Jungle.  It was an obviously sweet victory for Cincinnati coach Marvin Lewis, who helped build the Ravens defense that went to the Superbowl in 2000.

       On 10-8, the officer was on duty   ... at least to catch me speeding on my way to work.  I was cited and I have to either appear in court or pay the ticket.  The only problem is that I don't know which.  Instead of telling me what to do when I got the citation, I was told to call this telephone number after 7 days from receipt of the ticket.  Then I was to find out whether I could pay it.  Procrastination struck again, and I didn't make the phone call.  Now the only time I can do it is on Monday morning, the day it was written that I was to appear in court.  Prayerfully, I can call the phone number at 8 AM, and they will say that it's something I can pay.  Otherwise I'm supposed to appear at 8:30 AM, which currently seems impossible.

       My Distracted Mind   I've been having an  urlLink ADHD  moment.  I came home from work this afternoon, at about 5:45 PM and greeted my family.  I noticed that Jake, our dog, was very eager to see me.  Jennie mentioned that she hadn't taken him out since she'd been home, which was about 4 PM.  I started to change my clothes, and I got as far as taking my work shirt off and emptying my pockets.  I'd even taken off my belt.  Then the phone rang, and I walked out to the kitchen to see if it was a phone call from someone I wanted to talk to.  No message was left, but I did notice that we had a couple messages, so I checked them.  Keisha came in the kitchen and starting calling out, "Oscar... Oscar..."  Oscar is  urlLink my mom 's boyfriend, and when she lived with us, he would call almost every day for her, leaving a message that began like this:"Margaret...  Maaar-gret... Maaaarr-gret!"  When Keisha said that, I asked her if she wanted to call her  urlLink Nana  later.  She said yes.  Then I realized that we needed to recharge our  urlLink BigZoo.com  long distance card.  To do that, I would need to get on the Internet.  So I sat down at the computer, and, of course, I had to put some music on.  So I did.  Then I connected to the Internet, and of course, I had to check my email and blogs and stuff.  Then Jennie mentioned that dinner was ready, so we sat down for dinner, and the computer was still connected.  We ate dinner, and I returned to the computer.  I posted a couple things to my blogs, answered some email, made some comments to others' posts.  I finally realized that I still need to recharge our BigZoo.com card.  So, I changed into some jeans and put on the sweatshirt that I'd worn this morning before Keisha went to school.  Also, Keisha's been upset with me because she couldn't find the tiny dolls she gave me before she got on the school bus.  I thought I came back inside and put them on the counter, but they weren't there.  Did I say she was upset?  She was.  Very.  At me.  I told her to go to her room and pray about how she was feeling.  As I've been typing this post, Jennie and Keisha were talking about where these tiny dolls could be.  I mentioned to Jennie that I was the "point person" because Keisha gave them to me just before she got on her school bus.  Jennie asked me what I was wearing when that happened, and I realized that they were probably still in my pocket.  I checked, and yes, they were!  Keisha was glad as I handed them back to her, and she walked with Jennie toward her room.  "My Daddy lied," she said.  Jennie let out a laugh.  "What?" I asked Jennie.  "She said, 'My Daddy lied to me'."  "Oh."  It wasn't that I was intentionally trying to keep the dolls from her; I'd just forgotten where I'd placed them.  I had planned to help Keisha find them, once I got the BigZoo.com card recharged, and - oh yes, that's right - I still have to take the dog out.  I'm amazed at his patience.  I really am.  So, now, I conclude this post.  It's after 7:30 PM.  I'm going to recharge the BigZoo.com card like I said I would an hour ago, and then I'm going to take Jake for his walk.  After that, I'm going to come home, Keisha will call her  urlLink Nana , and the world will be in harmony once more.   My world  at least.  Maybe.  Now, where are my shoes?

       It Can't Smell That Bad!   Keisha just went to the bathroom, and all of a sudden Jennie and I started hearing something spray.  Jennie started to chuckle, and I became perplexed.  The spraying from the bathroom continued, and I realized that Keisha was spraying air freshener all over the bathroom, and it was spreading throughout the entire apartment!  Jennie said, "It can't smell that bad!"  I asked Keisha if she'd gone poop (there - I said that word!), and she said that she only went pee (that other word!).  So Jennie sent her back to the bathroom to turn on the exhaust fan.  Ugh!

       I Didn't Have to Go Back After All   Someone, maybe Mark Twain, once said that common sense is not so common.  I believe that has been one of the truths in my life.  Yesterday I inadvertently brought home the keys used to unlock the locks to the liquor and beer cabinets at work.  I was mortified and called work to tell them that I'd be bringing them back later.  We had a men's meeting for church, and afterward, I drove the 20 minutes back there, only to have the servers and other bartender tell me that I didn't have to return after all.  Yes, I would need the keys to UNlock the cabinet, but not to LOCK the cabinets!!!  I took the opportunity, nevertheless, to chat with some of the customers.  I got some free beer from one of their pitchers, and, in general, had a good time.

       He Has Great Taste!   I think that  urlLink Mike Zellers, aka '_monk', aka 'spacemonk' , has some great taste in life.  In  urlLink today's post  he mentions some coconut noodles and a mango/lime with soda drink.  He also likes jazz and Dido.  Moreover he likes ' urlLink Alias '!  Here are my comments to his post: It sounds like you're having fun...  I'll have to try that drink sometime.  I've heard "White Flag" a couple times on the radio station here in Dayton.  I'm hooked on Dido, too.  I've also gotten my daughter hooked.  Every time she hears her sing "It's not so bad, it's not so bad" (from "Thank You"), she starts singing along.  I missed most of " urlLink Alias " this past Sunday.  That's not to say that I didn't see it.  I was working at the bar, and I had the TV turned on to the show, but I was distracted by doing work and couldn't pick up the storyline very well.  My wife attempted to tape it and " urlLink The Practice ", but she inadvertently had the VCR set to Fox, so we got to watch part of "Varsity Blues" instead.

       A Sonic Boom Anniversary   On this date, in 1947 in the California desert, a test pilot named Chuck Yeager piloted the Bell X-1 faster than the speed of sound for the first time in history.  Visitors to the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. can see this history plane on display. (via  urlLink U.S. Newswire )  Of course for me, I'm vividly reminded of this scene at the beginning of the movie "The Right Stuff," which is one of my all-time favorites.  On Wednesday, March 19, 2003, I blogged about  urlLink finding a picture of a sonic boom .  Check it out.

       Continuing the Journey   Tomorrow I have a therapist appointment.  I posted some thoughts in a poem entitled  urlLink "Reflection"  to  urlLink "Streams of Consciousness" .  At the last meeting, the therapist recommended I get some "stress balls" to keep my hands busy instead of picking.  I did that, and, if I have them nearby, I've found them to be helpful.  Speaking of Self-Injury, I found this great article entitled  urlLink "When Pain Is All You Have,"  which you may want to read to get a better understanding of self harm.  I also found this article/message board thread on WebMD that contains  urlLink ways others keep themselves safe  (i.e., what to do instead of self-injury).   Note: the next few paragraphs contain details of self harm and may contain triggers for those who may be vulnerable.   Last night, however, I started messing with a scab on my wrist.  It was close to being healed, and I started picking the scab off it.  Eventually, I saw that if I continued to squeeze the area, the blood blister underneath would pop.  It did.  Then I saw how thick the scarry skin around the scab was.  I decided to bite it in order to make it smoother.  Of course there was some bleeding.  I looked for the hydrogen peroxide, which I usually administer after an episode like this, but I couldn't find it.  I took a wad of toilet paper, soaked it in cold water, and applied it to the wound so that the bleeding would slow and stop.  Then I found the Band-Aid&trade; Liquid Bandage kit and applied the liquid bandage to the area.

        urlLink U2 Sermons    I found this interesting site via  urlLink blogs4God .  I think that the big reason why I enjoy U2's music is the spiritual aspect of it.  How inspiring it was to see Bono open his jacket during the  urlLink 2002 Superbowl Halftime show  to display the American flag.  You may recall that this happened at the end of "Where the Streets Have No Name," a song that helps us to long for heaven.  What a moving sight.  That, along with the scrolling names of all those we lost on 9/11/2001 during "MLK" and the beginning of "Where the Streets Have No Name."

      I saw a link to the blog "Winds of Change," and I was reminded of the song of the same title by The Scorpions from over a decade ago.  What a great song, talking about the changes going on in the former Soviet Union.    Then I was reminded of an AISEC International meeting I attended back in college.  Some of the members had returned from an international meeting in which there were other members from around the former Yugoslavia.  These members, our local group reported, vowed that they would not fight each other, even though they saw that their country was headed toward civil war.  Our local delegation reported that, at the end of the conference, they all had joined hands and sang "Winds of Change."  Tears were in everyone's eyes.  It must have been a moving experience.  I also remember hearing about how our church had just sent a mission team to Moscow, and how God's Winds of Change were moving there.  It's interesting how a single phrase can bring back all these memories.

       I Love A British Accent   Carla mentions another in what I suppose is a collection of  urlLink Cool Things To Do With An English Accent .  Her post and it's comments reminded me of what happened last night at the restaurant where I've been bartending.  We have one British gentleman who is on loan from Her Majesty's Royal Air Force.  He's been a regular for a few weeks now.  Then, last night, I met a woman from North London whose accent was just lovely!  I told her so, and she was tickled, to say the least.  She was vacationing with some of her other 50-something friends.  I told her that listening to her accent was just so refreshing that I almost wished that I could tape-record her voice to play back when I get down.  We discussed how, in her opinion, Americans have butchered the "Queen's English."  It was quite humorous, actually.  So, with that, mates, I'm going to pouhr some moh tea!

       Let's Give Them Something to Blog About   That's a rephrasing of a Bonnie Raitt song (insert your link here), of course.  If you're ever searching for something to blog about, let me direct you to the  urlLink Topics blog .  The blog is no longer being updated, but it contains several interesting ideas; some of which I thought of.  For example:  Do you have any songs in your music library that have the same title but are from different artists? Do you have any that are not covers (i.e., remakes) of the original song but still have the same title? ( urlLink Feb 26 '03 ) Do you have, or have you ever had, any chronic illnesses? For example, for the first 7 years of my life I could practically count on getting an earache. ( urlLink Feb 22 '03 ) Post an entry in a foreign language that you know. ( urlLink Jan 22 '03 ) With that in mind, let me encourage you to let me know if you post about any of these topics.  I'm interested in your thoughts.

       Journey Inside My Mind   Okay, so I lied.  I wanted to mention this in a separate post and do it while it was still fresh in my head.  You may know from reading my blog in the past, that I struggle with self-injury (for more info, do a Google search in this blog; I'm too tired to find a link to a specific post right now - sorry).  Basically, I pick at scabs on my body to make them bleed.  At my last visit to the therapist, he recommended that I get some of those stress balls, that you squeeze to relieve stress.  I had told him that I felt like I needed to keep my hands busy (read "distracted") so that I would be able to resist the urge to pick.  On Thursday afternoon, Keisha and I walked up and down the toy aisle at the local Meijer store, and I bought two of those stress balls.

       High-Flying with the Kitefliers   Just one more quick post before I head off to bed...  This week at the hotel where I'm working, we've been hosting the  urlLink American Kitefliers Association .  They are having their  urlLink National Convention and Grand National Competition in Dayton, Ohio  this year as part of the celebration of the 100th anniversary of flight.  These people have been a lot of fun to serve, and they sure have been keeping the bar busy!  One of the gentlemen in the group is celebrating a birthday this week, and, as a card was being passed around, one other gentleman brought it up to me and asked me to sign it, since I was a part of this event, too.  He asked me to make sure the recipient would know it was his bartender who'd signed it.  So, I wrote: "Happy Birthday!  Dan the Bartender"  I suppose that was good enough.  Remind me to mention more about the guy who gave me his band's CD, and to include the link I got from one guy who maintains a newsletter.  Bye for now!

       'Alias' - Back and Still Kickin'!   I saw the season premiere of 'Alias' this past Sunday, but I havent' thought of posting until  urlLink Mike  left me a comment about it.  The title of this post is meant to be a little "tongue-in-cheek" because, if you've ever seen the show, Sydney Bristow uses a lot of karate, kung fu, and probably some other martial arts to get her point across to anyone who attacks her.  I was surprised that she attacked Vaughn, and I'm encouraged so far by what I've seen.  I have an idea of what happened to Sydney over the past two years, but I think I'll reserve it for a later post.  I mentioned to Mike in comments to his post that I'm thinking of adding the first two season's DVDs to my Christmas list this year.  That, and perhaps the same for CSI.

       Blog Notes   I'm revising the blog templates for  urlLink Letters to God  and Streams of Consciousness.  For one thing, I do not care how people get there, and as such I do not need a Sitemeter to track statistics.  For another thing, I'm removing comments on Streams of Consciousness, since I'm making that a private blog.  I've never had comments on  urlLink Letters to God , and I do not plan to put them there either (It's intended to be one-sided communication between me and God, as you may already know.).   urlLink Get That Job! ,  urlLink QuotesBlog , and  urlLink this one  lend themselves to being public blogs, and I plan to keep them that way.  I've added a section to the links to highlight the  urlLink Officials  of this website.  I appreciate you for the service you provide! *grin*  For more information about Officials check out the  urlLink FAQ page .

       Sunday Musings   Keisha and I went to church in Cincinnati this morning.  It had been nearly six or more months since we'd visited the church down there.  I had to take today off work because Jennie was working today as well.  I would rather not work on Sundays at all in order to spend time with the body, the church.  I was so encouraged to see so many people I've known over the years, and they were encouraged to see us two.  The church put on a one-act play from the book of Acts in the Bible.  It was not what I had expected, yet it was wonderful all the same.  Convicting, powerful, encouraging, too.  Afterward, Keisha and I stopped at the Hardee's in Middletown for a quick bite to eat.  I tried one of their thickburgers, and she had two of their slammers.  I guess I could say more, but I'll wait until tomorrow.

        urlLink U.S. Newswire - U.S. Census Bureau Daily Feature for Dec. 1: Unlocking the Body's Secrets   WASHINGTON, Nov. 30 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Following is the daily "Profile America" feature for Dec. 1 from the U.S. Census Bureau:  MONDAY, DEC. 1: UNLOCKING THE BODY'S SECRETS  Profile America -- Monday, Dec. 1. One of the most important scientific efforts in history was announced on this day four years ago -- the mapping of the first human chromosome. Since then, all 23 pairs of chromosomes found in human cells have been blueprinted, allowing researchers to study the genes they contain. So far, this physical map has led to the identification of about 100 disease-causing genes. Attention is now being focused on the role genes play in diseases that have a complex pattern of inheritance, such as diabetes, asthma, cancer and mental illness. Cancer alone claims the lives of more than half a million Americans each year. You can find these and more facts about America from the U.S. Census Bureau on the Web at  urlLink http://www.census.gov  Isn't science wonderful?

        urlLink All She Wants for Christmas Is Her Two Front Teeth    Thanks to everyone who has already commented about  urlLink the disagreement between me and my wife .  Yesterday morning, Keisha showed me that the remaining tooth was hanging crooked, barely attached to her mouth.  She asked me if I could help her.  I instructed her to get me a large piece of floss, which she did.  After a little bit of tugging, we took a break.  Then, on an impulse, I took the floss, wrapped it around the loose tooth, and gave it a firm but quick tug.  The tooth came out.  We put it in a glass of water, and I had Keisha rinse her mouth out with some salt water.  Now she's got such a cute, half toothless smile.  This also helps me appreciate how important those incisors are when eating.  This morning we went to an all-you-can-eat fruit and salad bar.  Keisha, who loves to eat melon, could only eat Jello.  I've also been reminded of when she was just beginning to get her teeth in as an infant.  I loved putting my hand into her mouth from time to time as she was teething, to feel where the new teeth were coming in.  So the Tooth Fairy made another visit last night.  This time she left $2; apparently, she took  urlLink advice from others who have commented to this blog .  Now Keisha can tell Santa Claus  urlLink what she wants for Christmas !

       More Adventures in Toothdom   I cannot believe my wife.  Last night, as I took the dog for a walk and spent some time talking with a neighbor, she pulled one of Keisha's two front teeth out.  Of course that's not that big of a deal in and of itself.  I mentioned earlier that we'd made arrangements for the Tooth Fairy to come by to exchange Keisha's tooth for some money.  I asked Jennie how much we thought the Tooth Fairy should leave, and, would you believe she said, "$20."  "$20?!?!?" I was floored.  I told her I didn't think we had a savings account that allotted that much money for a tooth.  Whatever happened to just a quarter?  I mean, that was over 25 years ago.  I told her that a dollar should be enough.    She kept trying to haggle with me.  ?$10.  C'mon, Dan.  Two $5 dollar bills.  It's worth it for what she went through."  I wouldn't budge.  Finally, we woke Keisha up to go to the bathroom, and I noticed that the "Tooth Fairy" had left a $5 bill.  I exchanged it for a $1 bill.  After all, I don't want our daughter to get expectations for future visits from the Tooth Fairy.  Am I being unreasonable here?  I mean, what's the going rate for a tooth these days?  Help me out here.

       Men Rules    via email from Corky    We always hear "the rules" from the female side. Now here are the rules from the male side. These are our rules! Please note...these are all numbered "1" ON PURPOSE!  1. Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's up, put it down. We need it up, you need it down. You don't hear us complaining about you leaving it down.  1. Sunday = sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.  1. Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think of it that way.   1. Crying is blackmail.   1. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do not work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work! Just say it!   1. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.   1. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.   1. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.    1. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 days.   1. If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act like soap opera guys.   1. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us.   1. If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.   1. You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done. Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.   1. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials.   1. Christopher Columbus did not need directions and neither do we.   1. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings. Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a color. Pumpkin is also a fruit. We have no idea what mauve is.   1. If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that.   1. If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle.   1. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you don't want to hear.   1. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine...Really.   1. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as baseball, the shotgun formation, TRAINS, cars, trucks, tools or monster trucks.   1. You have enough clothes.   1. You have too many shoes.   1. I am in shape. Round is a shape.  1. Thank you for reading this; Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch tonight, but did you know men really don't mind that, it's like camping.

       Yet Another Tooth   Keisha has had her top two front teeth loose for the past couple weeks.  It's gotten to the point that they have moved away from their adjacent teeth and are "scrunched" close to each other.  Well, until we got home from dinner tonight.  Jennie helped pull one of them out.  Keisha looks so cute, with the one tooth hanging down in the front of her mouth!  We've already talked about how I'm going to call the tooth fairy, who happens to have dog treats for those houses that have dogs.  You see, Keisha is concerned that the tooth fairy won't want to come in because of our dog Jake.  Keisha had even promised that she'd hold Jake while she slept.  Needless to say, she's been a little excited.  Earlier, however, she was a bit lethargic, having had a cold and runny nose.  This morning, for example, while we were taking Jake for a walk, as we waited for her bus to arrive, she sneezed and her nose leaked a bit, if you know what I mean.  Then her bus arrived, and the driver asked if I had a tissue, and I replied that I was going to ask her the same thing.  She handed Keisha a paper towel instead.   This just in : Keisha showed me the tooth, and, as I held it, this conversation ensued: "Daddy, you know what I was thinking?  I was thinking that, tomorrow morning, you could give me a 'prise (i.e., surprise) because my tooth came out."  "You already have the tooth fairy coming out," I replied.  "I don't think it works out that way."  "I know," she said, "but I was thinking you could get me a doll or something like that."  "I don't think so," I replied. It sounds like she's trying to milk this moment for all she can get.

       At the Library   Greetings from the  urlLink Dayton Metro Library's Main branch , located near the heart of downtown Dayton, Ohio USA!  I've always found it ironic that, situated diagonally from the library are two establishments with what I would think are diametrically opposing missions.  One place is called Today's Adult Entertainment Center, and next door to it is Dayton Church Supply.  I want to take a picture and post it to  urlLink my photolog  so that you can understand the juxtaposition.  Why all the wordiness today, Dan? you ask.  I don't really know where it's coming from.  I just had two awesome pints of  urlLink Guinness  draft from the  urlLink Dublin Irish Pub .  They were not consumed on an empty stomach, however.  I ate a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese, Medium Fries, and Medium Coca Cola (light ice) from  urlLink McDonald's  beforehand.  By the way, that would be a Double Royale with Cheese for my European readers (I'm reminded of the movie  urlLink Pulp Fiction  for some reason.).

       Work and Some Advice From Behind the Bar   I got home from work about an hour ago.  I worked from 11 AM Saturday until we closed, which was after midnight.  I'm tired.  I also see this as an answered prayer; I prayed to God to help us get more money, and, by working the extra hours today, we did.  In more general news, on the humorous side, I'll send you to this article on the  urlLink Top 10 Worst Pick Up Lines .  I've had the opportunity working at the bar to see a few people (mostly men) crash and burn as they tried to pick up on another person.  The latest was last Monday or Tuesday.  What a doozy!

       Keep in Touch, No Matter What   See to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness. --  urlLink Hebrews 3:12-13   I am so grateful to live in an era in which the technology exists that I can communicate with so many people across so many boundaries.  I recently mentioned that  urlLink I found a way to use my home PC and an internet connection to talk to deaf people .  I just spent the last hour doing that, in fact.  A generous man will prosper;  he who refreshes others will himself be refreshed. --  urlLink Proverbs 11:25   And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds. --  urlLink Hebrews 10:24   I find that, when I'm feeling down or lonely and I want to be cheered up, all I need to do is encourage someone else.  I know that by doing that I myself get encouraged.  I find great joy in seeing great qualities in others.  I learn to appreciate them so much more.  I spoke with A., for example.  She and her husband are expecting their third child in May.  He's been working so much lately that they haven't been coming to church.  She felt upset that I was yet another person calling to ask her why she hasn't been to church, and I can tell that it's been a sort of stumbling block in her relationships with others.  I just told her that I miss being encouraged by her and the chance to encourage her as well.  I mentioned to her that when one part of the body hurts, every part hurts with it ( urlLink 1 Corinthians 12:26 ).  I said this not to be down on her, but just to convey my love for her and her family.  I want to call her husband, who is hearing, this evening.  Then I called to talk to T.  She and her husband recently had their second child, and I was fortunate to call when the baby was asleep.  She, like I, tends to wear her heart on her sleeve, which means that it's not hard to tell that she was encouraged by my phone call.  I asked her what I could pray for her about.  She mentioned that she didn't have a Bible, and that she wanted to get one so that she could read and learn from God.  We talked about some of the main points from last Sunday's message, and I shared with her a passage I read yesterday:  Not one of all the LORD's good promises to the house of Israel failed; every one was fulfilled. --  urlLink Joshua 21:45   This passage clearly indicates that God keeps his promises.  I have a difficult time in trusting God, and it's manifested itself in a host of dysfunctional ways, as regular readers of this blog can attest.  As I shared this with her, I could tell she was encouraged by that, too.  I just want to keep in touch with my brothers and sisters in Christ, and others, too.  Over 12 years ago, I read this book called  urlLink  Balcony People  , by Joyce Landorf Heatherley.  It's only a short volume, and I got the point after just reading the first couple of pages.  From that time on, I have desired to be a  urlLink Balcony Person  to as many others as I can.

       You Go, Bro!   I just received this email from my sister M. in Texas.  It concerns my baby brother PJ. Hi  I'm writing to let everyone know that P.J. has advanced rank in the Navy.  This is an amazing task because he was 1 out of 17 out of the entire Navy  who took an exam to make it.  He is now classified as an E4 and he is now a 3rd Class Petty Officer.  I'm sending him a congratulations card.  If you would like to send him your thoughts please respond by Friday, so I can promptly mail out his card.  I will print out what you send and put it in his card.  I'm so proud of him.  He finally is where he wanted to be and is finally happy for a change.  Feel free to ask anyone else in our family to send along a message to him as well he does get lonely at times and I'm sure he'd love to here from everyone.  With love,  M. That's great news!  I don't know if you ever read this, bro, but I am so glad to have you as a brother!

       Your Home PC as a TTY Machine   I have a few friends from church who are deaf, and, because my daughter's hard of hearing, we've been able to meet many others in the deaf and hard of hearing community in Dayton, Ohio USA.  Usually when I call one of these deaf friends I have to do it through the Ohio Relay Service; I simply dial 711, and the relay attendant (a human) takes me through the process to call my friend's TTY machine.  The relay individual then reads what the TTY user types and types what I say in return.  I've been wondering whether TTY software exists that I could somehow transform my home PC into a TTY machine.  So I  urlLink Googled  and found a post about such a thing in the  urlLink AllDeaf.com  forum.  The group over there recommends the service that  urlLink NextTalk.net  provides.  The great thing about it is that the service is free!  You do have to register and download their software, but you can call a TTY user with it.  I have since tried it out on my three friends from church and found out that it works!  AT&T has a relay service via the internet that enables a deaf or speech-impaired person communicate with someone else without a TTY machine.  Their website is  urlLink http://relay.att.com .

       Family Time   I'm taking a little break to blog today, since Keisha has laid herself down for a nap.  I helped her make her bed, and then she lined up all of her dolls in front of it, as if to play "class".  After I'd phoned a few friends, I noticed that she'd fallen asleep on her bedroom floor, holding her favorite doll.  Moments like that are too precious!  So, I called my wife at work to tell her.  Jennie had the day off yesterday, and she took Jake to the dog groomer.  He came back looking like a new dog!  "Handsome," Keisha said.  Also, a couple days ago, I noticed that Tinky and Binky had passed away.  As I think about it, we never really committed in our hearts to take care of fish in a bowl.  It was simply an emotional decision on my part to buy Keisha some fish.  It's cold here in Dayton.  I looked at the online forecast, and it's going to stay in the 40s all day.  Not much sun, either.  It kinda makes me want to stay inside snuggled up in a warm blanket and a good book.

       Seasonal Employment, Part 1   We've been slowly unpacking the rest of our stuff.  I say 'we', but I really mean my wife Jennie.  One of the items she found is fond reminder of a job I had at Christmastime while in college.  A clipping from the December 24, 1993 front page of the Cincinnati Enquirer contains a photo of me.  The caption under the photo reads as follows: Dan Johnson, Jr., a senior at the University of Cincinnati, helps Logan Abner, 2, put money into the [Salvation Army] kettle at the Madeira Kroger store Thursday.  Johnson plays the saxophone to lure donations. The photo was taken by Glenn Hartong, and it shows me bundled up, wearing a Santa cap, with my alto saxophone hanging from my neck, helping Logan put his coins into the kettle.  I remember that job fondly.  I needed it to have money for rent and stuff.  The folks at the Madeira Kroger warmly welcomed my music.  Every so often, as I would get cold, I'd go inside for a break.  The crew of cashiers would ask me to play "O Holy Night" for them.  I did, and everyone applauded.  I was grateful to be able to cheer them up.  I also recall being encouraged by one of my friends' mom.  I actually knew her because she took a class with me in college.  She lived in Madeira, and once, on her way out of the store, she handed me a cookie and cup of hot chocolate.  How very thoughtful!  I read in this past Sunday's classifieds that the Salvation Army is looking for talented musicians to man their kettles again this year.  It something to consider.    crossposted to  urlLink Get That Job! - a job hunting and career development resource

       Home from Work   I've been home from work for almost an hour now.  It's almost 5 AM EST here in Dayton, Ohio USA.  Frost is on the windshields and grass.  It's a balmy 25 degrees Fahrenheit.  We were not that busy tonight.  I found myself, during part of my shift, feeling down and wanting to go home.  I simultaneously feel that yesterday (Friday) was one of the worst and one of the best days I've had.  I'm reminded of my need to take my medicine and head to bed.  I've been picking at the scabs on my left foot and elsewhere.  My left foot, near my ankle, feels very raw.  Anyhow, I also am realizing that business at the hotel is very seasonal, and as we head toward the holidays, it also means we head toward a slow time.  I'm wondering if I should get another job, maybe one closer to home.  Also, it looks like we're going to have my Mom's car as our primary mode of transportation.  The amount of money needed to reinstate the loan we have on our car is something we cannot afford right now.  Working out the logistics for Jennie and I, when we both work on the same day, presents a bit of a challenge.  I was thinking about this as I drove home.  I need to get to bed.  The longer I stay up, the more scabs I'm finding to pick open.  Good night.

       An Overnight Visit From the Repo Man   As Jennie left the apartment to go to work this morning, she discovered that our car was missing!  We contacted our insurance company, who, by the way, told us that our insurance had been cancelled.  Yet they started a claim for us.  We contacted the police department, and they told us our car had been repossessed.  So Jennie is staying home from work today while we figure out what we're going to do.  We've already contacted the creditor and left a message with their "reinstatement" department.  So, now it's our turn to wait for the return phone call.  This is a good exercise and overall lesson for us.  I can see that.  To deal with the emotional stress of this situation, I have reopened some existing scabs, and I realized that it's been my typical method of dealing with it.  I either try to avoid the stressful situations altogether, or I deal with it by creating physical pain.  The physical pain is something I'm better at controlling than the emotional pain.  I'm glad that I'm realizing this.  I'm also glad that Jennie is here so that we can work together as a team.  One thing we've realized is that communication is a weakness in our marriage; there have been a lot of assumptions and expectations that have been unrealistic or, better yet, not made known.  I pray to realize the strength and power I have to deal with the emotional stress in a constructive manner.  I pray to be able to communicate my thoughts and feelings openly, constructively.  I'm also grateful for the medication and therapy.  I can tell I've been very distracted this morning, and it's helpful not only to realize this, but also to have someone else around to help reign me in.  Please keep praying for us!

       "A journey of a thousand leagues begins with a single step."  -- Chinese Proverb, via  urlLink QuotesBlog   A quick glance here and you will no doubt realize that this is a long post.  It’s four pages on my word processor at home.  I haven’t really tried to make it sound organized; it’s been mostly an outpouring of my heart.  Just so you know, it’s a pretty heavy post.  Note:  the text in this post may contain graphic descriptions of self-injury.  Please use caution when reading.  Read on, if you so desire.  It does get better at the end.  Here we go...  I’ve been reading through this book entitled  urlLink Cutting: Understanding & Overcoming Self-Mutilation by Steven Levenkron .  It’s causing me to think about my own behavior: where it comes from and how I can overcome it.  Actually, that’s the reason why I checked the book out from the library: to help me to overcome the self-mutilation.  I keep trying to remember when I started to self-injure.  I think the first time I saw it was when I was about six or seven years old.  I was sitting on the front porch with a girl in the neighborhood.  I think her parents, or maybe just her mom, was inside with my mom.  I saw her pick at a scab on her arm.  I don’t remember anything else about that moment.  I felt a little bit of respect for her because she was older than I.  My mom and dad were separated when I was six years old.  My sister and I would hear them argue, and I remember that it hurt me deeply to see Mom and Dad so mad at each other.  I remember, some time later, actually seeing my Dad throw my Mom down the stairs.  She wound up wearing a neck brace for some time after that.  A young child hasn’t the ability to cope with his parents’ fallibility.  I sure wasn’t.  My entire feelings of security were threatened by this separation and the ensuing divorce.  My Dad was an alcoholic and my Mom was yet undiagnosed with bipolar disorder.  Mom came to rely on me for emotional support, as I grew older.  I know now that it’s not supposed to happen that way.  Children are supposed to get a sense of protection and security from the authority that parents have.  I don’t recall having that from either my mom or dad.  Mom always tried so hard not to disparage Dad in front of my sister and me.  We lived with her, and we would visit Dad on the weekends.  I guess I naturally began to hate what was going on.  I envied friends whose parents were still together, longing for the family I didn’t have.  Yet in my mind, I felt that Mom and Dad could do no wrong.  After all, they’re Mom and Dad.  I guess that’s when I started to turn my anger inward.  I have always had a hard time expressing anger outwardly.  When I was 15 years old, my sister and I spent the summer in Texas with my Mom.  I don’t remember exactly what it was, but somehow I got into such a heated argument with my mom that I ran away for a little while.  I was so upset with her, and I didn’t know how to handle my feelings, so I walked out of her house.  I wound up in a Catholic church building near the neighborhood.  I was praying about what was going on, and I resolved to head back home.  Mom sat me down, and I tried so hard to stay angry with her, yet as she laid into me verbally, I saw that what she was saying was right.  Since that time, Mom and I have been close.  Yet I know that there are moments with her and also with Dad that I don’t feel comfortable expressing anger.  In a way, I suppose that I have no right to be angry.  I guess that’s how it feels.  And so I turn inward.  I remember one incident, as a teenager, living with my Dad and stepmother.  I’d been studying, and I suppose that I’d gotten frustrated at something with it.  I started scratching my face.  I don’t really remember why.  It started to feel “good,” and I continued to scratch.  Eventually, I used all the fingers on both hands, and I scratched my face until I’d broken skin.  My room was downstairs, and I had a separate bathroom, too.  I remember going to the bathroom to wash my face off, to try to hide what I’d just done.  Yet, as I went to the dinner table, it was obvious.  I don’t really remember what I told Dad and June.  The next day at school, people were asking me, joking with me, that I’d lost a fight with a cat.  I went along with it; too ashamed to tell them what really happened.  I guess that’s a big thing about the self-mutilating behavior, too: shame.  I’d have to say I feel a lot of shame right now for the recent behavior.  I’ve often had a hard time seeing my faults, but maybe it was just a way of not having to deal with the pain of my own fallibility.  What I’m trying to say is this:  I eventually came to realize that I had to fend for myself.  I couldn’t really trust my parents and stepparents enough to really talk with them about how I was feeling.  I found self-worth in things I knew I could do well; namely, schoolwork and, later on, playing the saxophone.  I was pretty confident that I could do these things well and get praise for it, so I began to rely on my own strength. And as others saw me do these things well, I felt good, too.  I would take any criticism really hard; so hard, that, pretty soon people stopped trying to relate to me.  They felt that they had to handle me with “kid gloves,” which only made me feel worse.  At no time did it occur to anyone that I needed help.  On the outside everything looked normal.  I was, after all, a clean-cut, high-achieving student.  “Stay the way you are and you’ll go far” was a common phrase other classmates would write in my yearbooks.  After my first year of college, the time came for me to get a co-op job with a company who did work related to my field of study.  I saw this as a great opportunity for me to move away from home for a little while, and I found such a job.  I had never been out on my own before, so my natural instincts took over.  I did a pretty good job taking care of myself.  Yet when I received a letter from my stepmother during that time that basically told me that I was going to need to find a place of my own when it was time for me to head back to school, I felt crushed.  I felt like they didn’t want me around.  Looking back, I can see that in general it was a good thing.  At the time I felt abandoned, however.  So I continued to trust in my own abilities to fend for myself, and I got frustrated with myself when I failed.  I took the frustrations out on myself.  I had such high personal standards that when I didn’t reach them, I felt more and more inadequate.  I can see that this is how the perfectionism exhibited itself.  It was prevalent long before I moved out on my own, however.  I think it started when I was much younger, after my folks had gotten divorced.  As I see these written words, I cannot help but feel grateful to God.  He has shown me through his word that I don’t need to be perfect.  He doesn’t expect me to be perfect.  He knows how I’m made; he knows me better than anyone else.  Jesus was perfect, and his perfection is all I need.  I am realizing how important God’s grace to me is.  Words like “lavished”, “freely-given”, “overflowing” mean so much to me in this context.  I need help remembering all of this.  I realized this morning that it’s Satan who wants me to stay mired in the feelings of inadequacy.  It’s Satan who’s been telling me all these lies about myself.  I’ve found myself wanting to believe them.  If there could be one single thing I could ask for, spiritually, it would be this:  to be able to trust God and others.  I struggle with trust.  I’m afraid of opening myself up to others because I don’t want to be hurt.  I resort to self-mutilating behavior because of the hurts I’ve experienced in the past from trusting others.  I’ve written these things here mainly to help myself, but I realize I’m not writing this in a vacuum.  It helps for others to know me a little better, and perhaps it will help someone else, too.  With that in mind, I’d like to find a support group of others who deal with the same things as I.    This passage from  urlLink 1 John 1:5-10  (emphasis added) also helps: This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light; in him there is no darkness at all. If we claim to have fellowship with him yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live by the truth.  But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.    If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.  If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.  If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word has no place in our lives. These are some of the many promises of God for me to hold onto.

       Depressing Day in the Journey   I've had a rough day.  I came home from work last night and got on the computer.  I was on the computer for three hours, and during that time I took my shoes and socks off and began scratching my left foot and ankle.  I scratched really hard, breaking skin.  At the time it didn't hurt much, but, as the day progressed, it has.  I finally went to bed at around 5 AM this morning, taking the Lexapro, the antidepressant which is supposed to set my brain up with more seratonin.  It's the seratonin that is supposed to help me with the depression and self-injurious tendencies.  I slept for a few hours before Keisha woke up to get ready for a morning doctor's appointment.  Jennie had today off, so she got Keisha ready.  I fell back to sleep until Jennie returned home, a little after noon.  I took Jake for a walk.  I heard from Jennie that the pediatrician has concluded that Keisha has the weight of a 14 year old and the height of an 8 year old.  She's 112 pounds and a little over 4 feet tall.  She's only 6 years old.  As I began to realize that I've been responsible for my daughter's physical condition, I got depressed.  I realize that if we continue living how we've been living, she'll have a lot of health problems in the future.  I feel like I could be killing my own daughter if I don't do something.  I spent a little time remembering how she was as an infant, toddler, and younger girl.  She's already getting teased by other kids about her weight.  Jennie mentioned that her pediatrician wants us to meet with a nutritionist soon.  I know that we'll have to make some lifestyle changes, and it feels overwhelming right now.  Also, we've been getting daily phone calls from the company we have our car loan with.  We haven't made a payment in a few months.  They're talking about pursuing "recovery action".  I know I need to call them, but I don't really know what to say.  I feel a little down at how much my life has changed.  In a way, I long for the time when work was more steady, we could pay our bills, and life seemed a lot more manageable.  I feel like I just want to retreat into a cocoon and stay there until spring.

       Man and His Best Friend   Man and his best friend are quite alike.  This is something I've realized when I've taken our dog Jake for walks.  I like to surf the internet, looking for interesting websites here and there.  If I find one that's particularly interesting, then I may stay there for awhile to take it in.  If it is really interesting, then I will bookmark it or add it to my blog.  Jake enjoys surveying the area where I take him for his walk.  He puts his head to the ground and sniffs around.  Sometimes he finds something really interesting, and he stays there for awhile.  Then he has his own way of "marking his spot", if you know what I mean.

       I should be in bed, asleep, but I had to tell you about...   I got home from work about 45 minutes ago.  It wasn't a crazy night, but it was busy enough for me.  There was one moment when I got into a fight with a Frozen Strawberry Daiquiri over whipped cream, and it won.  We don't have the aerosol whipped cream; instead, we have the stuff that bakers use.  I struggled to squeeze it out and wound up knocking the glass over.  Fortunately, the glass didn't break.  It was just a big mess for a little while.

       I Have a Common Last Name   A long time ago, somewhere in Sweden, there was a man who was the son of another man named John.  Let's say his name was Ivan.  Perhaps there were several Ivans in his neighborhood.  It became necessary to distinguish which Ivan he was.  So he added some form of "Johnson" to his name and became Ivan Johnson, or some variant of that.  Whether it was really in Sweden or somewhere else, I've come to realize that by doing research on the origin of my last name won't get me very far.  I only have to look in the local phone book to see how many "Johnsons" there are.  I'm sure that my great-grandfather Ivan from Sweden probably changed his name somewhere between the time when he lived in Sweden and the time when he arrived at Ellis Island, in New York near the turn of the 20th century.  I've certainly found several variants myself: Johannsen, Johanssen, Johanson, and so on.  I'm not surprised that there are many other "Dan Johnson's" on the Internet.

       Plans for the New Year   I suppose that this is a good time to think about such things.  Jennie and I talked yesterday.  She'd like to do some more sewing.  We need to get a particular part for her sewing machine, though, first.  I want to continue learning the guitar.  At least 20 minutes a day -- that's what they say.  I also want to continue writing.  In 2004 I want to find out what I need to do to become an English teacher.  I already have a degree in Civil Engineering, and I know that there are some other things I need.  It may mean that I go back to school for a few classes or whatever.  Also, I got a mixing kit for Christmas, so I want to look at bartending some private parties as a source of extra income.  I want to continue growing and overcoming self-injury.  I want to develop better strategies for dealing with the negative aspects of ADHD and accentuate the positive qualities.  I want to be less independent and open myself up to others more in 2004.  I'm sure that a slogan exists somewhere in this post, huh?

       Me Update: Week 2   Our home PC is still sick.  I checked out a book from the library, and it appears that I may actually need a new motherboard.  That may be the easiest thing to replace.  Alas, for now I must resort to the library computers for email, blogging, and the like.  As I mentioned last week, it's not all a bad thing.  I've been getting better with the guitar and spending time with Keisha, since she's on her Christmas break now, too.  It's also helpful to me because when I come to the library computers, I have focus on what I'm going to do, instead of some random time spent surfing the 'net and such.  I'm not saying that such activity is bad, but I am saying that it can be a bad thing to do that every day for hours at a time.  Mom's hanging in there.  I found out that she got to hear from all of her kids over Christmas.  My younger sister, who hadn't talked to her in several months, spent a little bit of time with her.  Mom's car, "Maxine", is showing her age.  She's a 1983 Nissan Maxima.  She needs, among other things:  new brakes spare tire right hand windshield wiper new muffler system tune up alignment  and probably some other things that I cannot think of right now.  Jennie and I are just glad to have some transportation.  We'll need to get some serious work done before Mom hands over the title next May.  Combining this with my lack of work over the last month, and I can think of many other things to be anxious about.  I'm very glad that Jennie has been able to pick up some extra hours at work.

       Me Update: In Brief   Home PC not working.  Some type of prob with PCI Ethernet Controller.  I do not know how to fix it.  Alas, I have to check emails and surf the 'net at the library.  Not all a bad thing, since I've been spending more time away from the computer.  Been practicing the guitar, learning chords and strumming.  I'm going through a couple of books I got from the library.  Left fingertips are sore.  Been watching a lot of movies with the time off.  Go to IMDB.com to see what they are about, if you're interested. Sum of All Fears The Powerpuff Girls Royal Tennenbaums Panic Room  Also going through some books related to mystery writing.  I need to do more offline journaling, especially my crime site ideas.  At night the imagination goes wild sometimes!  Christmas Eve we went to my aunt and uncle's in Cincinnati.  Ate dinner and saw some other relatives.  Spoke with a cousin who is in prison by phone.  Uncle took some digital pics of us and printed out copies for us to take back home.  Jennie worked on Christmas.  We opened presents in a rush, right before she went to work.  We left the wrapping all over the living room floor for a few hours so that we could just enjoy the presents and relax.  Keisha fell asleep on our bed yesterday.  It was a great idea because Jake and I took a nap too.  I also set up the bed frame -- our box spring and mattress have been on the floor since we moved in October.  Now our bed is higher.  I forgot about that this morning when I got out of bed and almost fell on the floor!  Jennie got me some silk pajamas and a silk robe.  The design makes me think of Austin Powers (yeah, baby, yeah!).  My wife is glad that I got my mojo on.  Also, she got me a shaving kit with gel, face wash, after shave, etc.  I took the hint and shaved off my beard and moustache last night.  We ate Christmas ham I'd gotten from work, with macaroni and cheese, brussel sprouts, beets, and candied yams.  I forsook the beets and yams in lieu of the brussel sprouts.  A beer to wash it all down was good, too.  I'll probably blog about Keisha's presents at another time: keyboard and kid karaoke machine.  How long do those batteries last?  That's all for now.

We received a card with the following inscription on it:  Fill not your hearts with pain and sorrow, but remember me in every tomorrow. Remember the joy, the laughter, the smiles, I've only gone to rest a little while. Although my leaving causes pain and grief, my going has eased my hurt and given me relief. So dry your eyes and remember me, Not as I am now, but as I used to be. Because I will remember yu all and look on with a smile. Understand, in your hearts, I've only gone to rest awhile. As long as I have the love of each of you, I can live my life in the hearts of all of you.

       Christmas Service   Yesterday we had a special Christmas service at church.  It was mainly a lot of singing and performing of the Christmas songs of the season.  I played "O Holy Night" on my saxophone.  I had really blown it (no pun intended) with respect to practicing and getting prepared for it.  I'd also planned to sing "Mary's Boy Child".  I'd been blowing both of these off, and I'd even blown off a rehearsal last Thursday night.  I happened to see the brother who was in charge of the program on Saturday evening.  I had planned to call him later that evening anyway, to apologize.  I used the occasion to apologize to him in person.  Later that evening, we went home, and I searched for the sheet music.  You see, I used to have a booklet with music, that I had from the Salvation Army, from when I volunteered there in 1993.  When I couldn't find that, I sought online, and I was fortunate (thank you, God) to have found it.  I also needed the exact words for "Mary's Boy Child", and I was grateful to have found them online, too.  I also am grateful that we had a recording of the song at home.  I believe that God blessed the spirit of repentance, because I received numerous compliments for my performance.  I was also able to encourage other musicians by telling them that I'm learning the guitar.  One sister came to me and said she would like to do a duet, since she plays the clarinet.  I offered to do the arrangement myself.  So, everything worked out well.

       Bible Study: Overcoming   Recently while reading some passages in Revelation, I was struck by how often Jesus Christ uses the word "overcome."  I thought it would be worthwhile to examine these passages more closely; especially given my present struggles, which I've mentioned here and in  urlLink Letters to God .  First of all, there is the word  overcome .  It signifies that trouble, hardship, and the like are  normal  in the life of a disciple of Jesus Christ.  He himself said, in  urlLink John 16:33   In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.  We are guaranteed that we will have troubles during our lifetime; our focus, therefore, needs to be on overcoming these things as we journey homeward.  Secondly, I'm encouraged by what  urlLink Jesus Christ says will happen to those who overcome , which I've included in the list below.  I've emphasized the words signifying the promise to those who overcome.  "To him who overcomes, I will give  the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God  ( urlLink Revelation 2:7 )." "He who overcomes will  not be hurt at all by the second death  ( urlLink Revelation 2:11 )." "To him who overcomes, I will give  some of the hidden manna . I will also give him  a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to him who receives it  ( urlLink Revelation 2:17 )." "To him who overcomes and does my will to the end, I will give  authority over the nations --      'He will rule them with an iron scepter;      he will dash them to pieces like pottery'--  just as I have received authority from my Father. I will also give him  the morning star  ( urlLink Revelation 2:26-28 )." "He who overcomes will, like them,  be dressed in white. I will never blot out his name from the book of life, but will acknowledge his name before my Father and his angels  ( urlLink Revelation 3:5 )." "Him who overcomes I will  make a pillar in the temple of my God. Never again will he leave it. I will write on him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God ; and I will also  write on him my new name  ( urlLink Revelation 3:12 )." "To him who overcomes, I will give  the right to sit with me on my throne , just as I overcame and sat down with my Father on his throne ( urlLink Revelation 3:21 )." "He who overcomes will  inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will be my son  ( urlLink Revelation 21:7 )." I don't claim to know all the answers with respect to the symbolism in Revelation, but everything here sounds wonderful, and it encourages me to keep on going.  I'm reminded of  urlLink Dory's conversation with Marlin, in the movie Finding Nemo :  Dory:  Hey Mr. Grumpy Gills. When life gets you down do you wanna know what you've gotta do?   Marlin:  No I don't wanna know.   Dory: [singing]  Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming swimming. What do we do? We swim, swim.   Marlin:  Dory, no singing.   Dory: [continuing]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ho! I love so swim. When you want to swim you want to swim!   Marlin:  Now I'm stuck with that song!. Now it's in my head!   That's what we need to do, even though we don't know exactly where we're heading in the near future.  Just keep swimming.  Lastly, I'm reminded of this quotation, which I found only recently: "A straight path never leads anywhere except to the objective." --  urlLink André Gide

       Journey Inside My Mind: The Continuing Saga   Jennie and I went to the Job Center this afternoon to discuss our insurance stuff with our caseworker.  She set us up to have MedicAid for this month and CareSource for next month.  We stopped by the pharmacy afterward because I had prescriptions from last week to fill.  Unfortunately, the billing stuff has not been set up yet with MedicAid.  So I will have to contact our caseworker tomorrow to see what's going on, and then contact the pharmacy to verify that the insurance will go through, before going back to get my medicines.  In other news, I slept from 11 PM last night until 12:30 PM this afternoon.  I had some very interesting dreams, which I don't have time to mention right now.  Let me just say that it confirms what this blog's tagline says:  "My dreams are weirder than yours."   That's only because I think my dreams are weird.  Yours may be, too.  I think mine are weirder.  So there.

As the former mayor of Dayton, Congressman Turner understands the problems ailing our cities. Congressman Turner will coordinate with other members of Congress, Committees, and the Administration to look at ways to help rejuvenate our cities and combat depression in areas through initiatives of homeownership, job creation, crime reduction, and community organization assistance. I sincerely hope that America's depressed cities will become a better place through this initiative.

       Holiday Party   We had a holiday party at the hotel where I work tonight.  It was nice.  I got a little bit of a bonus, and there was free food.  The management of the hotel served us.  Jennie, Keisha, and I sat at a table with others who work at the restaurant.  Stan the Magic Man performed.  We'd seen him at the Boonshoft Museum earlier in the year, but it was a good magic show nevertheless.  In other news, I'm on the schedule for this Saturday from 11 to 3 only.  Then, I'm off at least until January 2nd.  In some ways it's a good thing because Keisha will be off school, too.  In others, it isn't because I'm not getting paid much, or at all during this time.  Also, I found out after last Thursday's psychiatrist appointment, while trying to fill a prescription, that the insurance card I have has "expired."  Jennie called our case worker at the Montgomery County Job Center today, and we have a meeting with her to discuss it.  I discovered last night that tonight's dose of the Lexapro is my last until I get a refill.  I have some of the regular (i.e., not extended release) Adderall, which I can take.  So hopefully this meeting tomorrow will be fruitful, and we can get set up with insurance.  Also, I feel like I'm getting a sinus infection.  I feel the headache and the sinus pressure.  Then again, it may just be a cold.  I'm having a rough time having a great attitude about all of this.  It's supposed to be a happy time of year, and, in one sense I am grateful for all that I still have.  In another sense, I look at all that I have lost over the last year.  I see the lack of purchasing power we have, the tough financial times, the illnesses, and it feels depressing.  My initial tendency is to want to pull back from everything and retreat under the covers until someone tells me it's all over.  I guess I need to talk with God now.

I found out why: HARRISON TWP., Montgomery County -- One man was shot and seriously injured late Wednesday in Harrison Twp., the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office reported.   Sheriff's deputies were dispatched to 4164 Indian Runn Drive, Apt. D, just before midnight on a report of shots fired. A man, 20, had been shot at that location then ran to 4026 Indian Runn Drive, Apt. K, to seek help, according to deputies. The victim, who was hit in the chest and arm, was taken to an area hospital.   Two persons apprehended in the immediate area of the shooting were being questioned, according to the sheriff's office.

       Strep Throat   Keisha has  urlLink strep throat .  The pediatrician said that she needed to stay home a second day until the antibiotic was in her system for 24 hours.  So, Keisha and I have been hanging out these last two days.  The doctor said that their office had been packed lately with flu-related and strep-related patients.  The waiting room is divided up into two sections: one for well patients and one for sick patients.  When Keisha is sick she tends to want to snuggle and be loved up on (who doesn't, huh?).  This is a great opportunity for Mommy and Daddy to shower her with the love that she sometimes doesn't want.  What I mean to say is that there are times when she is well that she doesn't want to sit on my lap and have me hold her.  When she feels sick, however, she's more apt to do this.  I suppose that God allows her to get sick so that we can show her love.  It reminds me of  urlLink 2 Corinthians 1  in the Bible.

        urlLink Yahoo Patches IM Security Hole    I didn't even know that there was a security hole.  I'm glad I found this on my MSN.com: The vulnerability stems from an error in the "yauto.dll" file, an ActiveX component of Messenger. The security hole affects Yahoo Messenger versions 5.6.0.1347 and earlier, the  urlLink advisory  [issued Wednesday by Danish security company Secunia] said. To find out what version of Yahoo! Messenger you have, from the Yahoo! Messenger window, go to Help | About Yahoo! Messenger.  A popup window will appear, and it will show you what version you are running.  According to Yahoo!, the problem has more to do with a wider vulnerability in Internet Explorer than it does with their messaging software: Only users that have chosen to change IE's security settings to the "low" level, rather than the default "medium" setting, or that are not running the most recent IE patches would be vulnerable, Yahoo said. An attacker then would need to direct a vulnerable user to view malicious HTML code in order exploit the hole. Users still need to make sure that their security settings are set appropriately and use the most recent version of IE.

To date, very little research has been conducted that provides adults with AD/HD empirically-based approaches to understanding and coping with workplace issues.

This information and resource sheet will:  offer tips for improving on-the-job functioning describe the rights of individuals under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provide guidelines for making career choices  The assistance of a career counselor or a psychologist, social worker, or other health care worker with career counseling training is extremely helpful in understanding and maximizing these factors. Some individuals, however, may be able to carry out the steps discussed in this information and resource sheet with the help of questionnaires, checklists, and suggestions given in the career counseling books on the reference list.

       My Dreams Are Weirder Than Yours   So goes the tagline for this blog.  For example --  I dreamt yesterday that I'd driven this white compact car in England, and somehow the tires got slashed.  I didn't have any money to get the repairs done, and I panicked.  Fortunately, I was in the small town where Paul McCartney and his family lived.  In fact, his mother lived in a historic house with several historic vehicles in the parking lot.  I found my way to this house, and I learned that Paul's Mum was living off a huge trust that her deceased husband had bequeathed her.  I was allowed to stay at this house for a time.  I desperately wanted to get back to the States, but I needed help getting my passport and other things.  Then I learned how deep the McCartney family politics went.  I learned that one of Paul's brothers had gotten into some trouble with a neighboring clan from another town.  The problem was so deep that the head of this family was wanting one of their family to marry one if Paul's, in return for the calamity.  For some reason, the two clans each had distinguishing symbols on their right cheeks, corresponding to their respective families.  One way for me to get out of the country, I found out, was to take the place of this McCartney brother who was in trouble.  (I don't really remember if I was already married or not.)  After I reluctantly agreed, they helped me get set up so that I would pass as a member of the McCartney family.  I recall a scene at a train station in which they handed me my wedding clothes to change into.  I made my way to the men's room and did so.  I then remember driving to this mansion where I would meet my bride-to-be.  And that's all I can remember.

       Generosity   Wow.  I just came from a men's meeting at church, and I was handed an envelope and a heavy box as I was leaving.  Pointing to the envelope, the brother in Christ said, "This is from the Cincinnati church."  Laying the heavy box in the back seat of Mom's car, he said, "This is some stuff from the folks here in Dayton."  I got home and brought the things inside.  The box was full of canned goods, cake mixes, and other non-perishable items.  I looked at the envelope.  On the outside it said, "Dayton."  I opened it up and saw that it was a $20 gift certificate to Kroger, one of the supermarkets in town.  My wife and daughter don't even know about all of this yet.

      You know who you are.  You stop by the website, checking things out, but you never let me know you're here.  You take and take and take.  I know you've been here because I sometimes check the referrer logs.  But that's okay.  I'm not disappointed in you.  I want to give you an opportunity to get off the Mooch List and reveal yourself.

I'll even let you become an official part of this site, if you'd like.  For example, if you're a Java programmer, you can become the Official Java Programmer for Journey Inside My Mind.  It could be any particular office you'd like to hold, provided that another 'Official' has not already taken it.  Then you can tell everyone that you are an important person, because you are.

       News from the Battlefield   Interview went well.  Attending orientation yesterday afternoon.  A lot has changed in the last 10 years or so in how the company operates.  I've particularly noticed how much things have been standardized.  We got the phone turned back on late last week; I updated the outgoing message to say, "you've reached the NEW AND IMPROVED home", and so on.  I also added "Thanks again for calling, and make it a great day!"  (I'm sure that our creditors will be glad to hear it.)  In other news, on the way to a men's meeting at church on Tuesday evening, I received a traffic ticket for running a red light.  After getting the citation from the police officer, I had half a mind to turn around and return home.  I'm glad I didn't; being around other spiritual men helped me to get a better perspective and deal with my emotions.  I do plan to head to court next week to contest the ticket.  We'll see what happens.  Keisha has been having a lot of wetting accidents at school.  She's been taking medicine for bladder spasms, but it does not seem to taking care of the problem.  Yesterday afternoon she had another accident, and nearly all of the other kids in the classroom laughed at her.  In terms of academic aptitude, I would have to say that Keisha is near the head of her class.  So much so that the other kids like to hang around her to see how she does things.  Yet it's hard when she loses control of her bladder.  She came home yesterday and drew a picture of herself.  The face in the picture had tears.  More to come later.  My time on the computer at the library is up for now.

       Tears Fall Down Like Rain   That's what's happening as I just read an email I got from  urlLink Mom .  I miss her so much (*sob*)!  You can read about all that she's going through over at her blog:  urlLink Me, Myself, and I .  She has and always will be a true Balcony Person to me.  You probably have an idea what a balcony person is: someone who cheers you from the grandstands as you run the race.  That's what Mom is to me.  Somehow she always is able to encourage me despite her particular circumstances.  You truly are a great gift from God, Mom.  I love you 100 million thousand.  Here are some excerpts from her email:  I love you so much.  I was able to catch up on your blog...  ... I wish there was more I could do to help.  I am concerned that you have thoughts of stealing. It's not the things you want; it's the acting out. I hope you realize that. I am concerned also about the the high incidence of mutilating again...  ... I think I screwed everything up by coming back to Texas.  I am sure Keisha is wetting again because of the stress and anxiety of the situation at home as it it might be about anything else. It might be easy to be indulgent of her at this time but be cautious of that. You would be harming her not helping her.  Now when you need more than ever I am not there.  I feel bad for Jennie too. She doesn't deserve to be more stressed out.  I remember when you were an infant, I met an elderly lady at a laundromat, and she told me through conversation, when I reached the end of my rope to tie a knot and hang on.  I have remembered that so many times in these almost 34 years. Now I am telling you.  You tell Jennie.  Jesus said, "I will never leave you nor forsake you."  Remember, Satan comes to steal, kill and destroy. Don't let him.  You are MY child and you are God's child.  We have ahold of you. We always have and always will.  If I can survive all that I have and figure a way out of my situations, then you can too.  It may not be easy. Pull yourself up. Brush yourself off. Put your chin up.  You get out there and kick some a**, you hear me?  I know you have it in you because you have some of me in you. Think back to how Mom always found a way.  Maybe I made it look easy. If I did I am sorry. It wasn't easy. I guess I tried to spare you kids as a parent does.  Your family is depending on you. God wouldn't let you be in this position without giving you a way to handle it. Don't let pride get in your way. If you have to go to churches and ask for help in getting your phone turned on, do it. If you have to do it to keep utilities turned on, do it.  Then you can get the part time job.  urlLink As you said in your blog , they can't call you without the phone...  ...I love you all so much to allow you three to suffer without trying to do something...  ...Give Jennie and Keisha a kiss and hug for me.  Don't worry about me. I am going to be OK. I am worrying about y'all up there.  Love, Mom

       Yippee   I'm at the library, and I see that I've got a boatload of email and stuff to go through.  I'd like to post about the weekend and other stuff.  Hopefully I can before my 60 minutes here is up.

       A Frustrating Day   Today I woke Keisha up and we both took showers in our respective bathrooms.  We got dressed: she in her school uniform and I in some dress casual clothes.  We ate breakfast and took Jake the dog out as usual for a walk while we waited for her schoolbus to arrive.  Jake and I returned to the apartment after Keisha left, and I read today's edition of the  urlLink Dayton Daily News .  After this, I proceeded to complete applications for Wendy's and McDonald's, both of which I'd picked up last week.  I made sure that the information was as accurate as possible.  After this, I began to be a little restless and unfocused.  I knew I needed to head to those places to drop off the applications, but I delayed in doing it.  I spent about a half hour playing the acoustic guitar and looking for other job-related information.  I finished reading a book about getting organized and becoming goal-oriented.  Lunchtime came, and I had a banana and a bowl of chocolate ice cream.  This, after looking through the refrigerator and deciding that anything else was a waste of time.  Eventually, I left home with the applications in hand.  I arrived at Wendy's first and gave my application to one of the crew members.  She told me the name of the hiring manager and when she would be available for me to talk to her.  I then took the McD's application to the shift manager there, and she gave me a "What If" Situations test-thingy to complete.  I had to evaluate what I thought were appropriate behaviors in various situations I make get into while on the job at McDonald's.  I handed the completed What-If thingy, along with my application, to the shift manager.  She mentioned that the hiring manager would be in next Wednesday to look at the application.  I went to Subby's, and completed an application there, even though they are not hiring.  A bar named Frog's is situated nearby, but no one answered when I knocked on the door.  So I stopped by the Blockbuster video to fill out an application.  Their application process is electronic, so I sat down and completed the application for the next 50 minutes or so.  I also got to hear the last 45 minutes of "Agent Cody Banks" playing in the background.  One thing that has me frustrated and anxious is that our home phone has been disconnected.  I feel like I'm in a Catch-22 situation: I need a job to make money so that we can get the phone bill turned back on.  But in order to get the job I need to have a phone so that the potential employer can get a hold of me.  I've spent a lot of time picking at scabs today.  Make that the whole week/month.  Scabs on my scalp, scabs on my arms, scabs on my left leg.  I also found out today that our daughter Keisha has been very incontinent (having a lot of wetting accidents) at school.  It's very frustrating and embarrassing for all of us, not the least of which is Keisha.  So we're going to meet with the school nurse tomorrow and provide a medical release form so that she can discuss Keisha with her pediatrician.  Jennie has been having a rough time at her job.  Overwhelmed, overworked, underappreciated.  Some of this has to happen in every job, I suppose, but it seems that this one is burning her out.  Hopefully she can talk with an HR person or someone else in management soon.  The library is a great resource.  They are having a levy issue on the March 2 ballot.  If passed it will allow them to continue and expand the existing services.  I hope it does.  I know I need to rely on it more now.  I wish I had a PayPal account or something like that through which people could send donations, if they so wished.

       Parenting Moments to Remember   A couple nights ago, Keisha, our kindergartner, shared something that falls into the category of "the darnest things".  She began commenting about how much she liked her backside... because it's "huge".  Then she proceeded to show us.  Jennie and I, while glad of her healthy self-esteem, see the need to rein it in a little bit.  Also, last night, our dog Jake got into the trash and tore up some stuff that was just "disgusting".  I took him out for a walk while Jennie and Keisha took care of the mess.  After returning, I was sure to let him know that getting into the trash was being a "bad dog".  He was sent to his "bedroom" for the night.

       Job Seeker Class: Reflections   I'm at a computer kiosk at Sinclair Community College.  The Job Seeker's class I'd been taking had its last session today.  Generally speaking, that experience has provided me with the desire to set some goals.  I have not been one to do that.  In interviews, when asked about my career plans and goals, I've often said that I haven't really made any clear plans, given the uncertainty in the working environment these days.  It was a  cop-out.  I admit it.  I have a hard time focusing on what is really important.  Also, I tend to think in abstract generalities and have difficulty getting to the concrete specifics.  I think sometimes I just need to have someone get up in my face and tell me what I should do!  Actually, that was what one of our friends did last week.  She apologized if she came across as prying too much, and then she told me exactly what she thought about our family's life situation.  Yesterday I cancelled the internet service we'd had at home.  The computer's broke, and we only really used it to connect to the internet anyway.  Perhaps if/when we get the computer working again...

       A Weekend of Silence   Because our phone has been disconnected, we haven't been getting phone calls from bill collectors.  We've also been reading a lot more on our own.  At the library now, and they are closing in 5 minutes.  Need to check email.  Maybe I'll check in here tomorrow.  Keep praying for us...  P.S. Happy President's Day!

          I'm at the library, and they'll be closing in 20 minutes.  I've just spent the last 10-15 going through email, and I think I might have a little bit of time to blog here.  Bear with me; it's going to come pouring out without much organization: stream of consciousness, if you will.  Our family is struggling to survive, financially.  Today we had our phone disconnected again (last time was in December).  Some friends from church are helping us pay our water bill so that it doesn't get any further behind.  We have electric heating, and the bill for our 2-BR apt is approx. $230 per month.  I feel like we're just flushing money out the door with that kind of bill.  We may be late with rent again this coming month.  Yesterday I went to the therapist.  It's been, shall I say, an emotional two weeks?  Wednesday night I was so upset and stressed that I opened every single scab on my body - just because.  I'm tempted to feel like such a failure - worthless.  I get down on myself so easily and hard.  BTW, the home PC has become a giant paperweight for now.  I'm going to have the internet service disconnected.  Blogging and email -- web access, will have to happen sporadically as a result.  We've gone through a lot of papers we've had lying around. Much to throw away and/or destroy (those important papers).  We've also found some other important stuff.  We hope to get some substantial money back from our tax returns, which we still need to do.  I may look at doing it electronically, based on what the printed info from the IRS says.  We also have some money in a 401(k) accout I have through a former employer.  We may decide to liquidate that, and pay the tax penalties - just to have some income around.  Jennie has been feeling a lot of stress with her job.  It appears that there is a serious management crisis there.  I need to get a part-time job; even if to just make some money to help out a bit financially.  Something within walking distance, even just during the lunch rush.  Last night at church we had a Wives' Appreciation Night.  Nice dinner, soft music, great fellowship.  During the evening, wives won prizes.  Also, husbands got up to share about their spouses.  I sang and played an original song on the guitar for my wife, called "I Love Lovin' You".  Let's just say that people were moved by my boldness, heart, etc.  I'd warned them that it was going to be a little rough since I'd only been playing since December.  It worked, though.  Jennie cried.  Mom's been getting to know herself better on her blog.  Check it out.  Pray for us!  Pray that I and the rest of my family doesn't lose hope!  Pray that the money will come!  Speaking of which, I've found myself tempted to steal lately -- just the thoughts of doing it.  Envious, too, of those who have better things than we do.  Those are some other things I need to have prayer for.  I guess that's all for now.

       CHADD UNVEILS FIRST ONLINE LIBRARY ON AD/HD  User-Friendly Resource Increases Public Access to the Science of AD/HD LANDOVER, MD. -- Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD) has unveiled the first and only online library dedicated to research and science-based resources and materials on AD/HD.  The online library ( urlLink http://www.help4adhd.org/library.cfm ) is a project of the National Resource Center on AD/HD (NRC), a collaboration between the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and CHADD, the nation's leading advocacy organization serving families and individuals affected by AD/HD.   "Now more than ever, people need help sorting through the overwhelming amount of information available on AD/HD," said CHADD National President Mary Durheim. "The NRC's online library allows CHADD to make accurate, science-based information about AD/HD more accessible to parents, educators, clinicians, government officials and individuals who often are left without a reliable source of information about the condition."  Users can browse or search the library with ease using a variety of search methods. The online library includes books for parents and teachers, resources for adults with AD/HD, and reference books and scientific articles for health and education professionals and researchers. Summaries of all resources are provided, and full text articles are available on the most relevant topics in the diagnosis of AD/HD, treatment options, school challenges and guidelines, and parenting tips. The library also offers full-text articles from "Attention Research Update," a well-respected electronic newsletter written by David Rabiner, Ph.D., a Senior Research Scholar in the Center for Child and Family Policy at Duke University. (Information about "Attention Research Update" is available at  urlLink http://www.helpforadd.com .)  "We are pleased to be working with the National Resource Center on AD/HD and CHADD to help bring information on AD/HD to all those who need it," said Edward Brann, M.D., M.P.H., director of the Division of Human Development and Disability at the CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, which directly funds the NRC and other prominent disability resource centers. "We look forward to working with the NRC to help grow this valuable resource in coming years."  The new online library is part of the NRC's mission to improve the health and quality of life of individuals with AD/HD and their families by expanding their knowledge and understanding of issues related to AD/HD and raising public awareness about AD/HD through outreach and the dissemination of information.   BACKGROUND   The National Resource Center on AD/HD is a proactive response to the CDC's 1999 Public Health Perspective Conference, which called for the development of:  a resource for both professionals and the public regarding what is known about the epidemiology of AD/HD, and  an avenue for the dissemination of accurate and valid information and materials related to the diagnosis of AD/HD and the availability of evidence-based interventions. According to the May 2002 CDC Vital and Health Statistics report, there are 1.623 million children with AD/HD (approximately 7 percent), ages 6-11.  In August 2002, CDC awarded CHADD $750,000 to establish and operate a national clearinghouse to disseminate science-based information on AD/HD. The Center is now fully staffed with healthcare experts, including specially trained information specialists, who respond to public inquiries in English and Spanish via the National Resource  Center (NRC) website,  urlLink http://www.help4adhd.org , and the toll-free number (800-233-4050).   Since its inception, CHADD has worked to improve the lives of people affected by AD/HD through collaborative leadership, advocacy, research, education and support: CHADD CARES. The NRC allows CHADD to maintain its role as a family support membership organization, while simultaneously creating new initiatives and free information clearinghouse services that benefit families, providers, policy-makers, educators, researchers and the general public.  For additional information about AD/HD or CHADD, please contact the National Resource Center at 800-233-4050, or visit the CHADD website at  urlLink www.chadd.org .  News From CHADD is a free electronic newsletter providing the latest federal action alerts, legislative and policy updates, and CHADD press releases.  Contributions to support CHADD are welcomed and can be made online   urlLink http://www.chadd.org   or via mail.  Make checks payable to: CHADD 8181 Professional Place, Suite 150, Landover, MD  20785  or through the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC #2555) Thank you.

       Library and Other Stuff   Not much time. Briefly:  Keisha's to get her new blue hearing aids today. Jennie and I had to walk to the gas station to buy gas because the car ran out at home. Moved things around at home; got rid of lots of papers.  Ultimately, this will help us manage our finance better -- at least to be a bit more organized with them.  Home PC is on the fritz: library blogging, as a result.  Monitor "broken?".  Console not booting up properly.  This Saturday will be 11 years since I first asked Jennie to be my girlfriend.  We've been together ever since.  Posted several quotations at  urlLink QuotesBlog .  Check out  urlLink Mom's blog .  She's got some great stuff over there.  That's all for now!

       GOLF ON THE MOON   WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Following is the daily "Profile America" feature for Feb. 6 from the U.S. Census Bureau:  FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 6: GOLF ON THE MOON  Profile America -- Friday, February 6th. Occasionally, when someone hits a tremendous golf shot, a partner will exclaim "out of this world!" The first and only golf shots really made out of this world occurred on this day in 1971. Astronaut Alan Shepard brought a six-iron he had stashed away aboard his Apollo spacecraft down to the surface of the moon and swung at three golf balls. He whiffed the first swing, but considering the bulkiness of his spacesuit, his others resulted in good shots. None of them went into orbit, however. Here on earth, nearly 27 million people play golf every year, making the rounds on some 15,500 courses, about two-thirds of them open to the public. You can find these and more facts about America from the U.S. Census Bureau on the Web at  urlLink http://www.census.gov   Now you know.

       Hectic Beginning of the Week   At the library right now with Jennie, my wife, who is off work.  Not much time left for this session, so I'll try to be brief.  I may be more thorough later.  We left a Superbowl Party early Sunday night because Jennie was not feeling well.  Contacted the nurses at her work to inform them that she should stay home on Monday.  The supervisor and a coworker recommended that she be taken to the Emergency Room (ER).  It was a little after 10 PM, but we all loaded into the car and went to the ER at Good Sam.  They'd done a lot of remodeling, and it was an overall pleasant atmosphere.  We brought a pillow and a blanket for Keisha.  Jennie is okay.  Power shut off yesterday, to be turned back on today... sometime.

       Psalm 13   For the director of music. A psalm of David.   1 How long, O LORD ? Will you forget me forever?  How long will you hide your face from me?  2 How long must I wrestle with my thoughts  and every day have sorrow in my heart?  How long will my enemy triumph over me?   3 Look on me and answer, O LORD my God.  Give light to my eyes, or I will sleep in death;  4 my enemy will say, "I have overcome him,"  and my foes will rejoice when I fall.   5 But I trust in your unfailing love;  my heart rejoices in your salvation.  6 I will sing to the LORD ,  for he has been good to me.

       I Am Not Loving It   Last night I was walking back to the grill area, and I slipped and fell, landing on my right hip, elbow, and hand.  I reported this accident to the manager, and she completed some paperwork after we closed last night.  After I'd reported it to her, she asked if I needed to go to Urgent Care (an after-hours clinic).  I told her that I felt I would be okay.  A little while later, while cleaning the grill (part of the closing routine), I burned my right index finger.  The pain was so acute that, along with the previous incident, I cursed and threw the utensil I'd been using, ripping off the latex gloves I was wearing as I headed toward the employee restroom to douse my right hand with cold water.  I wanted and needed the privacy because I was so upset.  I feel that the franchise owners do not convey an attitude that promotes safety.  There are management inconsistencies in this area as well as in other areas of the business.  Everyone has things that they value and desire when it comes to a job or a career.  Two of mine are  The company strives to live within its values and mission Every employee can be made to feel that he or she can make a difference Some coworkers asked me if I was okay after the burn incident.  I replied, "No.  I'm pissed off."  I feel like I've lost my heart for this job.  I definitely don't feel like giving more of myself to this company, and looking for extra ways to make it successful, if I'm not feeling like I'm that important to them.  I came home tired and upset.  Jennie and I talked, and I was so worked up that I had a hard time relaxing to fall asleep.  I needed to pray, so we did.  I don't want to work at a place where my wife is wondering whether I'll be able to come home in the same condition as I was when I left.  My feet have been hurting, too, from all the time I've spent over the years standing on my feet.  I suppose it's a chronic problem, but the pain has become more acute as of late.  Jennie recently saw a podiatrist about her feet, and I made an appointment to see someone from the same office for tomorrow morning.  I also contacted our family doctor to schedule and appointment related to my injury last night.  He doesn't see patients for work-related injuries, and his receptionist referred me to an occupational health clinic that does.  I made an appointment to see them for tomorrow afternoon.  I'm still feeling some pain in my right hand, elbow, and hip.  I also am feeling some pain on the right side of my back.  The power is still of at our place, by the way.  Jennie deposited my paycheck from last Friday into the bank on Saturday.  I had expected to make a cash withdrawal for an amount to take to the utility company's pay agent so that we could get the power back on today.  I found out after waiting in line at the bank, that the deposit had not gone through yet.  The teller said that it would post to our account this evening.  As I drove home, I wept and prayed, "God, I don't even know what to pray for anymore.  It seems that there is so much that we need, and I know that you know what we need even before we ask."  I'm tired.  I want all of this to be over.  I prayed last night that God would somehow take Jennie, Keisha, and I up to heaven so that we could be with him.  I feel like our lives would be so much better than the state where we are now.

       Prepping, Power, Passion    Prepping   Work at the restaurant has been okay.  I've been given more hours for this week's schedule.  I had it out with a couple coworkers last weekend, and I hope that this weekend will be much better.  I'm being trained in all areas of the grill crew, which is nice, since I've had to step in and help out in the different areas.  I'm not satisfied with this type of work, however, and I feel more urgency to find something for which I am more well-suited.   Power   The power company shut off our electricity yesterday while we all were out.  We are unable to pay for the service to keep it on.  We went to the $1.00 store yesterday afternoon to get some batteries and candles.  I figured out how to set up aluminum foil around the candles to make the light more reflective.  I want to get our grill assembled so that we can use it for cooking.  We feel like we're stuck in this deep financial pit with no foreseen way out.  We are having to be late in rent, phone bill, water bill, electricity -- the necessities.  All the more urgency to get the taxes done and cash in the 401(k).   Passion   Last night a close friend of mine took me to see " urlLink The Passion of the Christ ".  I am very grateful that he paid my way to see it.  It was like studying the medical account of Jesus' crucifixion all over again.  A few people walked out during the movie; I sat in my chair, stunned, shocked, weeping, incredulous, etc.  I'm reminded of  urlLink 1 Peter 2:24 .  There were no other movie previews, and there were few, if any, who brought refreshments into the theater.  It's not that kind of movie.  I like that Satan is an actual humanlike character, present all the way to discourage Jesus from going through with it.  The violence is indeed graphic: from the time of his arrest until he is lifted up on the cross, Jesus is slapped, whipped, kicked, spit upon, derided, or otherwise abused.  The twelve minute scourging scene -- whoa.  Even one of the centurions who'd ordered it was upset because Jesus was so close to death from it.  That Jesus endured this abuse voluntarily, when he could have stopped it at anytime, is even more striking.  Some argue that the Jews killed Jesus Christ, but I believe that we all did it.  Jesus received the punishment that was due us for all of our sins.   urlLink My sin killed Jesus .  I beat him.  I murdered Jesus Christ.   urlLink And so did you .

       The Difference Between Men and Women, with Algebraic References   In Karen's recent post to " urlLink My Life ," she mentioned her difficulty with a certain male acquaintance.  She also mentions Algebra.  I used to think that was a very bad word, actually, until I learned what it was.  Below are my comments to her post:  Hi, Karen!  It's Dan, one of the above-mentioned "male friends".  Men and women are so different in the ways that they think about things.  I've heard that the path across both hemispheres of a woman's brain is like a superhighway, but the same path in a man's brain is like an old dirt path.  About the algebra... that reminds me of the joke about a teacher from the group al-Gebra who possessed weapons of math instruction. (rim shot)  I actually did well in Algebra, but I haven't used it much since I've been out of school.  Well, I'm mistaken... I have used it somewhat, but a lot of the advanced stuff I have not used.

       News from a Satellite Outpost    Happy St. Patrick's Day!  Greetings to all readers (casual, first-time, and regular)!  Top o' the day to ya!  It's St. Patrick's Day, and I'm seeing green.  Well, not really.  I would love for someone to buy me a pint of Guiness, though.   Wire You Doing That?  I'm at a friend's house, hooking up their new computer and setting up their home network.  I just wanted to drop by to say hi.   Fun in Traffic Court  Remind me to share about what happened with  urlLink my traffic ticket .  I went to court instead of simply paying the fine, by the way.  More to come later.   That Green Lining in My Wallet  Oh yeah, I should also update about  urlLink my job .  I'm still there, but you should here more of the story.   'Passion'-ate Preview  My friend Bob, who will always be the "Best Man" (he was in my wedding), plans to take me to see "The Passion of the Christ" this Thursday evening.  So, look for my thoughts on that soon.   Keeping the 'Fun' in Dysfunctional  We're still in one piece at home.  Getting frequent phone calls from the bank now, however; it might have something to do with the negative balance in our account.  Keisha is not having as many accidents now, Jennie seems to be hanging in there at her job, and Jake the dog is, well, neurotic as usual.  Jake loves the snow, along with just being outside, for that matter.  He seems to hop around like a bunny rabbit and loves to roll around in it.   White as, Well, Snow  Speaking of the snow, we got between 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm for my metric friends).  We are more than ready for the springtime weather.   Easter Sunday - When Will It Be?  Speaking of which, I read in the newspaper or a book about Easter some time ago why Easter is always on a different date every year.  After spring comes (the "vernal equinox"), note when the next full moon occurs.  Easter Sunday will be the next Sunday after that.  Use  that  bit of information to dazzle your friends!

       Two Wishes    Joke Alert!   A man walks into a restaurant with a full-grown ostrich behind him, and as he sits, the waitress comes over and asks for their order.  The man says, "I'll have a hamburger, fries and a coke," and turns to the ostrich. "What's yours?"  "I'll have the same," says the ostrich.  A short time later the waitress returns with the order. "That will be $6.40 please," and the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out exact change for payment.  The next day, the man and the ostrich come again and the man says, "I'll have a hamburger, fries and a coke," and the ostrich says, "I'll have the same." Once again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change.  This becomes a routine until late one evening, the two enter again.  "The usual?" asks the waitress.  "No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato and salad," says the man.  "Same for me," says the ostrich.  A short time later the waitress comes with the order and says, "That will be $12.62."  Once again the man pulls exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table.  The waitress can't hold back her curiosity any longer. "Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?"  "Well," says the man, "several years ago I was cleaning the attic and I found an old lamp. When I rubbed it a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, just put my hand in my pocket, and the right amount of money would always be there."  "That's brilliant!" says the waitress. "Most people would wish for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!"  "That's right! Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always there," says the man.  The waitress asks, "One other thing, sir, what's with the ostrich?"  The man sighs, pauses, and answers, "My second wish was for a tall chick with long legs who agrees with everything I say.   [via email from  urlLink Mom ]

Apparently those two are being approached with the idea of a spinoff series.  This year's season finale will also be the series finale.  According to " urlLink Plug Pulled on 'The Practice ," which comes via E!Online, wrapping up this season and the series will mean a lot of drama in the upcoming weeks.  Look for guest appearances by William Shatner and Dylan McDermott (aka Bobby Donnell), for example.  One reason we watch the show is that it comes on after 'Alias', naturally.

Thought you'd might like to see what happened to me last week. I went to the store the other day. I was only in there for about 5 minutes.   When I came out there was a city cop writing out a parking ticket. I went up to him and said, "Come on, buddy, how about giving a senior a break?" He ignored me and continued writing the ticket. I called him a Nazi. He glared at me and started writing another ticket for having worn tires. So I called him a piece of horse s***.   He finished the second ticket and put it on the windshield with the first. Then he started writing a third ticket. This went on for about 20 minutes. the more I abused him, the more tickets he wrote. I didn't give a crap. My car was parked around the corner.  I try to have a little fun each day It's important at my age.

       News from the Home Office   There is a lot to report on, so, without further ado, here we go!   Reading is Fun!  I've updated my reading list via  urlLink AllConsuming.net .  You can check out what I'm currently reading at  urlLink Dan's Domain .  There is one book I'm reading that is not in the AllConsuming.net database as of yet.  That book is entitled  urlLink Crime in the City , and it is edited by Martin Edwards.  It features short stories with the theme of big-city crime.  This collection was sponsored by the British Crime Writer's Association.   He Loves to Play Guitar!  One of my goals in learning the acoustic guitar is to be able to sing along with it.  Since I first started in December of last year, I have longed to be able to put something together that has some meaning.  Folk songs, children's songs, church songs, even the blues.  That's why I was so encouraged to find the tabulature (that's guitar-speak for the fret-string positions) for a great blues riff.  It's almost as good as having B.B. King here to teach me!   She Ain't Heavy, She's My Daughter!  Last Saturday morning, Keisha, Jake (our dog), and I went to the field near where we live for a walk and some outdoor play time.  I had the idea that Keisha and I could race between two markers.  I went first.  When it came time for Keisha to go, she resisted.  I offered to hold her hand and run with her.  We took off, but Keisha soon decided that it was too much for her.   She tried to let go, but I clung to her coatsleeve, and then she fell to the ground.  Eager to develop the fighter spirit in her (i.e., the resolve not to give up so easily), I bent down to pick her back up.  Immediately, I felt something "pull" in my lower back, and I knew I'd made a big mistake.  I rounded up Keisha and Jake, and we headed home.  I applied some topical ointment (not Ben-Gay, but something similar) and sat on a heating pad.  Both of these seemed to help.  Which reminds me that I need to tell you about...   It's not really a McJob  I had my first night of training at my new part-time job Saturday night.  I manned the bun warmer.  This task, of course lent itself to several double entendre type remarks: "Here's your buns!  They're nice and toasty!"  "Hot, steamy buns!  Yours for the picking!"  During my break I caught a few minutes of Forrest Gump, which aired on ABC.  As a result, I broke into my Forrest Gump routine, talking in my best Gump-ish voice.  That seemed to entertain my coworkers.  There was that remark about whether my being around the grill had affected me, though...  Nevertheless, I helped the crew to close the place, and I made the 20-minute jaunt home.  Which reminds me that I need to tell you about...   Sleepin' In On A Sunday Mornin'   Jennie and I forgot to set our alarm clock, so we wound up waking up when it was too late to get to church.  I guess it happens from time to time to everyone.  I really wasn't in any condition to go anywhere, though.  My back was feeling the pain in a major way.  I wound up calling in sick to work, letting the shift manager know that I'd be going to the doctor on Monday.  Which reminds me...   Papa called the Doctor, and the Doctor Said...   Jennie needed Mom's car on Monday, so I planned to catch the bus to my doctor's appointment.  I headed downtown and bought a monthly bus pass.  Then I grabbed several bus schedules and headed toward the bus stop.  I had never been on that particular bus before, so I was naturally confused when the driver took us way past where the doctor's office was.  After conferring with the driver, I realized that I could have gotten off a half an hour earlier and walked the rest of the way to the doctor's office.  Since he was heading back in that direction, that's exactly what I did.  I arrived about 45 minutes early for my appointment, and there I stayed, caught between a rock and a hard place -- deciding whether to let the Musak put me to sleep or to continue reading the book I brought with me.  The latter won out, albeit not without a fight.  Soon the nurse grabbed me, and I weighed in at a hefty 217 pounds.  She led me to the examining room.  Not too long a young gentleman, a student doctor, appeared.  He mentioned that he'd be helping my doctor today.  I told the chap what was wrong, and he was able to manipulate the upper part of my back.  I felt a little bit of relief.  After he left, my doctor entered.  He twisted me up like a pretzel (well, not quite) and was able to get the rest of my back realigned.  I'm still taking the pain medicine (8-hour Tylenol) for a little while, but the prognosis is good:  No more picking up Keisha without proper back posture!  Yeah, I'm feeling better.  Which reminds me that I need to tell you about...   Doctor EverythingWillBeAlright   Okay, so I'm being a bit sarcastic or otherwise loopy in this post.  I went to see the psychiatrist today.  Apparently there was an incident between a patient and him this morning that involved the police, so all subsequent appointments were delayed.  I decided to wait in the unbearable heat caused by the faulty HVAC system.  I was afraid that the female workers were going to comment about my chest and bellybutton hair, though! (just kidding)  The wait was about 45 minutes, and I used the time to catch up with my planner.  It was almost like meeting an old friend; I hadn't really used it since last Friday.  I eventually saw the doctor, and we talked about stuff that patients and psychiatrists talk about.  He was interested in whether the scab-picking had subsided; I told him that it hadn't.  The scabs are just hidden by my long-sleeve shirt, jeans, and baseball cap.  I also mentioned some depression episodes I'd had over the last few months.  There were some really intense times, as I may have mentioned here, that I'd just wanted to die.  The doc calls them "passive" rather than active feelings of suicide - i.e., not real, concrete plans to do away with myself.  We talked about how the past few years has been for me, how I felt I'd changed over that time.  It was really uplifting for me to see how much I have grown, how my perspective on life has changed.  I think I'm gonna be alright.  And speaking of things that are going to be alright...   Bookish voters approve library levy   That's the headline from today's  urlLink Dayton Daily News .  As a regular to the county's library system, I am quite grateful that others in the community share my desire to keep the library great.  I'd even love to have a part-time job at the library.  We'll have to see if they end the hiring freeze anytime soon.  Which reminds me of this other money-related story...   Dayton market sells $20M Mega Millions ticket   The Dayton Daily News also reports: "Ohio Lottery officials said Wednesday that someone bought a winning ticket for Tuesday's Mega Millions $20 million jackpot at the Food City store at 1829 Germantown St."  Maybe this person is or will soon be one of my (new) friends...

        urlLink Political Facts about Social Security     [I received this information in an email some time ago, but I was reluctant to share it here until I found evidence that it was true.]   Social Security is only one facet of big government, but what has happened since its original inception back in the 1930s is typical of party politics - in a Congress ruled primarily by the Democrat majority in all but a few of this program’s 66-year existence.  Here are a few facts to give you pause for concern:  Having paid into FICA for years and now receiving a monthly check, Social Security recipients are taxed on 85% of this money paid to the government to “save” for their future. Which political party took Social Security from an independent fund and put it in the general fund so that Congress could spend it?  Lyndon Johnson and the Democrat-controlled House and Senate.  Which party put a tax on Social Security?  Democrat Party.  Which party increased the tax on Social Security?  Democrat Party. Vice President Al Gore cast the deciding vote as President of the US Senate.  Which party gave immigrants Social Security even though they had paid nothing into it?  Democrat Party. A large majority of these immigrants are from south of the border, often receive their wages in cash, pay little or no income tax, and send most of their earnings to families in Mexico and Central America.  Which party now tells the American public that the Republicans want to take your Social Security?  Democrat Party. And the worst part about it is, people believe this false claim thanks to the mainstream media, the overwhelming majority of which is controlled by liberals.

        urlLink Sympathy for the Devil on 'Alias'    This MSN Entertainment article is all about "Arvin Sloane, a villain fans love to hate," adroitly portrayed by Ron Rifkin, who said My wife and I went over to Paris, which was difficult, to do press for the show. Apparently, it's a huge hit in Paris. People stopped me on the street saying, "Mr. Sloane, we love your show. You're an evil man." Rifkin provides some other background into Sloane's character, which is definitely worth reading if you enjoy the show.  I'm an avid fan of the drama series, and I hope that ABC will keep for the next season. Yesterday (22 Apr 2004) I read in the  urlLink Dayton Daily News  that it's on the infamous "bubble".  It was there last year, as this post on  urlLink SciFi2K.com news archives from Feb 2003  mentions: Feb 1: Alias On the Bubble: Fans of Alias might want to get the cards and letters ready - the save the show web domain name bought and sites designed designed. ABC is getting tired of Alias, despite the post superbowl ratings. Even with the 14.7 ratings it was the lowest post superbowl rated program ever. If the ratings don't start an upswing soon Jennifer Garner will be spending all her time as Electra on the big screen. Alias kicks ass people, but for some it might be too complicated. Like so many other shows, ratings rein supreme, quality does not.

       The Tractor Trailer and the Tollbooth   JOKE ALERT!   The driver of a huge tractor trailer lost control of his rig and plowed into an empty tollbooth and smashed it to pieces. He climbed down from the wreckage and looked around. Within a matter of minutes, another truck pulled up and unloaded a crew of workers.  The men picked up each broken piece of the former tollbooth and spread some kind of creamy substance on it, then they began fitting the pieces together. In less than a half hour, they had the entire tollbooth reconstructed and good as new.   "Astonishing!" the truck driver said to the crew chief. "What was that white stuff you used to get all of the pieces together?"   The crew chief said, "Oh, that was Tollgate Booth Paste."   Thanks to Dale U. for the email!

       Following Up on Those Thoughts I Had   I began writing this post over a week ago, and I just now have had a chance to come back to it.  I've taken a lot of this post from an email I sent to  urlLink Bene Diction, the Official Canuck of 'Journey Inside My Mind' .  It's good for others to read, too.  As  urlLink I mentioned recently , I've tended of late to use this blog as an outlet for my emotions.  I'm no longer able to provide daily updates, so  that  may explain the overall change in tone.  Were I able to provide daily updates, other readers would be able to see a more balanced picture of what's going on in my life.  I am grateful to God for the close relationships I have with brothers and sisters here in the church in Dayton, especially, and with those who are not as close.  I am grateful, too, for the therapy sessions and the medication that helps with my moods, etc.  Last month I was hurt at work, but I'm getting it taken care of through the Ohio Bureau of Worker's Compensation.  Over the past several weeks I've undergone physical therapy on my right hand, which has definitely helped.  The work restrictions were lifted this past Tuesday.  It's getting better all the time.  While chatting with a brother in Christ on the phone some weeks ago, I mentioned that I don't know what to pray for -- it seems that there is so much.  I know that  urlLink God knows what we need before we ask him , and the  urlLink Holy Spirit helps us when we are unable to communicate with words .  So I'm confident that God is taking care of me/us.  This brother, after hearing me share, said, "It sounds like you need a miracle."  I know that our circumstances could always get worse.  I know that there are others who have life much harder than I.  I also know that  urlLink God will not allow me to be tempted beyond what I can bear .  I just never thought I could bear so much, if you know what I mean! (lol)  Sure, I've had " urlLink passive suicidal ideation ," as it's known in the psychology world.  I have just wanted relief.  I have no plans to take myself out; I know from God's word that it's not my place to say when, where, and how -- my life is in God's hands.  I am grateful to have been reminded from the Scriptures, that, whenever suicide is mentioned, it's always in the context of being ungodly.  I'm reminded of   urlLink King Saul  in  urlLink 1 Chronicles 10, specifically verses 4, 13-14   urlLink King Zimri  in  urlLink 1 Kings 16:15-20   urlLink Judas ,  urlLink Matthew 27:1-10  and  urlLink Acts 1:18-19  Similarly, there are other examples where people felt like dying but didn't give into it ( urlLink Moses  and  urlLink Elijah ).  It's not my life to take: "I know, O LORD , that a man's life is not his own;  it is not for man to direct his steps." ( urlLink Jeremiah 10:23 ) Keeping these convictions has been a tremendous help.

       It's My Life - It's My Journey   Just a reminder.  I whine, moan, rant, cry, etc. here for my benefit.  This is a Journey Inside My Mind.  I may have already figured out the solution to a problem, and I just use this forum to vent my emotions.  Comments and traffic from others to this site is secondary to me.  Sometimes I just need someone to listen.  I'm afraid that this may alienate some regular readers, and I guess I'll have to live with that.  I began this blog for myself, and I'll continue to blog for myself.  Thanks!

       Not Dead Yet     We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.   urlLink 2 Corinthians 4:8-9 (NIV)    A righteous man may have many troubles,  but the LORD delivers him from them all   urlLink Psalm 34:19 (NIV)    If two weeks ago I felt like I was underneath a raincloud, then last week I was in the sunshine.

I guess I just have a better peace of mind than I did earlier.  It's not that the circumstances have changed as much as it is my outlook.

       (More Than) Three Chords and the Truth   All I got is a red guitar Three chords And the truth  All I got is a red guitar The rest is up to you   -- from  urlLink "All Along the Watchtower" by U2, from Rattle and Hum   I got an acoustic guitar as an  urlLink early Christmas present from my wife last December .  I have been passionate about learning to play it since then, and I'm encouraged by my progress.  I played  urlLink an original song for my wife in front of some married members at church , and I currently play it during the children's ministry class I help to teach on Sundays.   urlLink Learning the F major chord is one of the hardest things for new guitarists , and I've been no exception.  The hard part about it is that you're supposed to use the index finger to fret the first two strings:  urlLink check out this picture .  Getting this to work and making the strings ring has been a bit of a challeng.  This morning, however, while practicing, I finally figured out how to make it work.  So I gave myself a bit of a pat on the back. BTW, I've learned that the chord progression: C-Am-F-G7 is the same progression used for "Heart and Soul" and other oldies.  Now that I can play the F chord, I can do this progression.

       I'm Still Standing - Yeah, Yeah, Yeah   Greetings from the public library, where I can simply get lost in the veritable cornucopia of reading material.  I have had the pleasure of visiting a number of the library's branches, and I've found something to enjoy at every one of them.  I'm in a sort of mental funk right now.  It may be related to how I've spent Saturdays and Sundays.  I work late on Saturday, get a few hours of sleep on Sunday before church, and after church, get a couple more hours before heading back to work on Sunday afternoon.  By the time Monday morning comes, I'm trying to get back to normal waking and sleeping.  I'm writing this intial post of the day to inform you that I'm hanging in there.  I haven't checked email or even been on the computer for an entire week, so I've got a lot of catching up to do.  One email account lists 285 unread messages.  Fortunately most of them are spam.  Bear with me.  I have more to come later.

       The Knock-Down   [via email from Steve K.]   A college professor, an avowed atheist, was teaching his class. He shocked most of his students when he flatly stated he was going to prove there is no God. Addressing the ceiling he shouted: "God, if you are real, I want you to knock me off this platform. I'll give you 15 minutes!"  The lecture room fell silent. You could have heard a pin fall.      Ten minutes went by. Again he taunted God, saying, "Here I am, God. I'm still waiting."  His count-down got to the last couple of minutes when a Marine, just released from active duty and newly registered in the class, walked up to the professor, hit him full force in the face and sent him flailing from his lofty platform.  The students were shocked and a little scared. But the young Marine took a seat in the front row and sat silent. The class also fell silent...waiting.      Eventually, the professor came to, quite shaken. He looked at the young Marine in the front row. When the professor regained his senses enough to speak he asked: "What's the matter with you? Why did you do that?"  "God was busy. He sent me."

       The Mental Patients   [via email from  urlLink Mom ]   Jim and Mary were both patients in a mental hospital.  One day, while they were walking past the hospital swimming pool, Jim suddenly jumped into the deep end. He sank like a stone to the bottom and stayed there. Mary promptly jumped in to save him. She swam to the bottom and pulled him out. When the medical director became aware of Mary's heroic act, he immediately ordered her to be discharged from the hospital, as he now considered her to be mentally stable.  When he went to tell her the news, he said, "Mary, I have good news & bad news. The good news is you're being discharged because since you were able to jump in and save the life of another patient, I think you've regained your senses".  "The bad news is that Jim, the patient you saved, hanged himself in the bathroom with the belt of his robe. I am so sorry, but he's dead".  Mary replied, "He didn't hang himself, I put him there to dry."

        You tell me you're the lucky one But I see things differently And I have just begun to show you that you mean Everything to me I still feel the need to  Love a little stronger, dig a little deeper Go a little farther, anything to please you, girl Tonight I'm gunna start all over Show you girl what's in my heart Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, gunna love a little stronger   urlLink "Love a Little Stronger" (second verse and chorus) by Diamond Rio, via AskLyrics.com   DAYTON, Ohio -- It was 11 years ago on this date that I first told Jennie Doddy that I loved her.  While some may consider this insignificant, we don't.  What began on Valentine's Day 1993 had grown into true love, and I wanted the moment that I confessed it to her to be a memorable one.  Every Memorial Day weekend in Cincinnati, Ohio, where we lived, there is a festival called "A Taste of Cincinnati," in which downtown streets are closed, and they are taken over by vendors and various musical acts.  My best friend, Praveen Cherian, and I had set up the double date.  Sometime during that date I would walk Jennie across the Roebling Suspension Bridge, which is romantically lit up at night, to the middle.  As we would look out over the Ohio River, I would profess my love to her.  Unfortunately, it began to thunderstorm, and we all decided to go to a movie instead.  I needed to get some money, so while the other couple waited at a Hardee's, Jennie and I walked to the bank ATM.  And it was THERE, ladies and gentlemen, underneath the shelter of the bank's ATM machine, that I said to Jennie You know, I really love how our relationship is going right now.  And I love you, too. Jennie was so excited to have finally heard me say those important three words.  She echoed my sentiments.  Arm in arm, we walked to the grocery store, and I bought her a rose.  By the time we returned to the Hardee's, we were all ready for the date to be over anyway.  Eleven years later I must say that my love for her has grown stronger and deeper.  I've made her my wife, and we have a lovely daughter.  You could say that I'm just as sappy as ever.

        ABC announced Tuesday (May 18) that the fourth season of its cult-hit spy series is being held back until midseason as way to solve the on-this-week, off-the-next-two-weeks scheduling that has plagued the show.  It will be back in January 2005 with 22 consecutive episodes. Way cool.

      We may be moving back to Cincinnati this fall, when our lease is up at our current apartment.  Both Jennie and I grew up there, and we still have family connections there.  The strong connections that have kept us here in Dayton don't seem to be here anymore.  I pray for God to continue to give us wisdom as we investigate and make plans.  More to come later, perhaps.

      It was a great season finale this past Sunday.  I read in USA Today ABC's plan for the fall schedule, and Alias is not on it.  I'm very disappointed.  It's like the X-Files all over again.  Maybe I can get them to reconsider.  When I was a kid, I wrote the independent network when they cancelled " urlLink The Monkees ", and they wound up putting it back on.  Who's to say that we can't do this with Alias?   UPDATE, 5/27/2004:  As if I had nothing better to do with my life, I  urlLink Googled "Alias cancelled ABC"  and found a  urlLink discussion forum that has the scoop .  Alias will be returning midseason, in January 2005 with 22 episodes instead of 20.  In addition, they will be consecutive; i.e., we won't have any repeats.

      Greetings once again from the library.  I'm with Keisha tonight, and she's upset with me because I pulled her off her computer to sit next to me.  I know she'll get over it, especially since I sent her off to get some books, etc.  As I've walked our dog this past week, I've examined the trees in our area for cicada larvae.  They haven't shown up where we live in Harrison Township yet.  I heard from a coworker over the weekend that they're in West Carrollton, specifically  urlLink Cox Arboretum .  It's been so long -- I think since March -- since I last had our home computer turned on.  In addition to the motherboard going out on us, the monitor appeared to have gone bad, too.  I'm not that surprised, since we've had the PC since December 1999.  I got another monitor for it (used), and I'm going to hook it back up and turn the PC on this week to see what happens.  A great friend from church gave me an old Toshiba laptop she had from her job.  It has Win95 on it, also Microsoft Office apps.  I've had to clean off a lot of other stuff, but I'm glad that we have it to use.  These are some random thoughts I'm having right now.  I have more to post, later.   originally entitled "Insert Generic Post Title Here"

         urlLink The Invasion Is About To Begin    urlLink Cicada Mania - Your Source for Cicada Information on the Web     I've been eager to post about this for over two months now, since I realized that the 17-year cicadas (aka Brood X) were coming this spring.  Apparently, we could start hearing and seeing them any day now.  A few weeks ago, I was reminded of this in Parade magazine( urlLink The Invasion Is About To Begin ).  In the Midwest area of the United States, the College of Mount St. Joseph in Cincinnati has a website dedicated to this year's emergence ( urlLink Welcome to Cicada Watch 2004! ).   urlLink Mom  told me that in 1970, shortly after I was born, she'd have to put a blanket over my stroller to keep them from getting on me.  In 1987, I was a junior in high school, and I recall taking some pictures of dead cicadas in our backyard.  I remember that our dogs liked them, too.  WEBN, one of the local radio stations, spoofed a local pizza chain's commercial.  The pizza chain was Snappy Tomato Pizza, but in the spoof, the pizza chain was called Snappy Cicada Pizza.  I've linked to the  urlLink Cicada Mania website , which is probably the most comprehensive site available to describe what all the hubub is about.  The site reports that as of Saturday, 5/15/2004, the cicadas were spotted in Illinois, Michigan, and Delaware.  There are apparently some cicada recipes, and even a wedding planner.  Check out the brood map for Brood X at the  urlLink Great Lakes Cicada web site .  I'll be sure to report back soon.

      Jennie and I saw " urlLink 8 Mile " for the first time over the weekend.  I thought it was a good movie.  For the next 24 hours, I kept hearing the song "Lose Yourself" in my head.  Eminem should continue to pursue acting.  I came home from work Sunday night, and Jennie had the Survivor: Reunion special on.  Since I hadn't found out who won, I avoided her and the living room until 11 PM.  She had been taping the stuff for me, and I was able to find out on my own what happened.  Wow.

      Our home is once again candlelit and flashlit.  Apparently we didn't send enough money to the power co. to keep the juice on.  Yesterday they shut it off.  We'll have to wait until Friday (payday) to pay the amount needed to get it turned back on.  Jennie was really upset by it all while I was not as much.  I felt resigned to living the next few days without electricity again.  We talked about stuff last night, and an argument ensued just before she left for work.  For awhile I was really upset because by nature I want harmony in my marriage.  But time, it appeared, had helped heal the damage.  When she got home this morning, she seemed to be a lot better, which helped put me at ease.  Fortunately, the weather is not cold like it was in March, when we last had the power shut off.  In Dayton we've been blessed with summer-like weather; neighbors have actually turned their air-conditioning on.  We probably will, too, at some point.  Keisha and I looked at some fans yesterday while getting some more candles.  Unfortunately, the only battery-powered fans are those little handheld ones.  Maybe we'll get another electric one after we get the power back on.

      I've spent the past five hours at a friend's house doing battle with her computer system.  Specifically, it's the wireless network.  I was fortunate enough to find out that her PC was not affected by the Sasser worm.  I just look forward to heading home to see my wife and daughter soon.  BTW, the phrase 'doing battle' is a quasi- kung fu - related term.  A former coworker and I would talk about 'doing battle' as we mouthed what were English dubs for Chinese words in an old kung fu movie.

       Crew Worker in the Midst    "If you have a job without aggravation, you don't have a job." --  urlLink Malcolm Forbes    I've begun to settle in at work, it seems.  There are some aspects of it that I enjoy, that are really good for the "high stimulus" craving I have.  Other aspects I could do without; namely, the politics, the inconsistencies in following procedures.  The inconsistencies in following procedures is something I'm figuring out how to live with.  I liken my behavior to a detective who doesn't always "go by the book" on things and yet still accomplishes the organization's overall goal.

       From My Yahoo! - Dummies eTips  How many hours of your life have you lost looking for your keys on your way out the door? Having one fail safe storage spot and never yielding to the temptation to put keys somewhere else is an easy cure for the common condition of keylessness. The closest use for keys is near the door or the car, so depending on your setup, your key spot should be the front hall or by the garage door. A drawer in the hall table or key rack on the wall provides the place; you provide the willpower to put your keys in the drawer or on the rack.  Use your head when deciding what keys to carry each day. If you leave the house with 20 pounds' worth and you don't work as a jail warden, then lighten your load. Carry just the keys you need, which means you can leave the keys for the storage shed and your spouse's or children's cars at home. Keep the office filing cabinet keys . . . you guessed it, at the office.  For more information like this, get a copy of  urlLink Organizing For Dummies , by Eileen Roth. I should add this book to my favorites list at  urlLink AllConsuming.net .

      As if we really needed more drama in our lives - I say this tongue-in-cheek...  This morning Jennie found out results of a blood test she had done last week.  Her blood sugar is above 240 (sorry, I don't know what units, but it's high).  Her cholesterol is also high.  This means some big lifestyle changes for our entire family.  Jennie has been apprehensive of getting diabetes, and yet it appears that is what's going on.  I'm thankful to know that there are many others who've had to go through this already.  Specifically, I know about  urlLink Garry  and  urlLink Carla .  We'll be in touch!

      Last Tuesday the car broke down.  Maxine, the name Mom gave her 1983 Datsun Nissan Maxima and gave to us when she moved back to Texas last year, finally died.  I've written here in the past about the problems we'd been having with the car.  I'm reminded of a friend's comment that the least expensive car is the one you already own.  I'm also reminded of the scene near the climax of  urlLink "The Blues Brothers"  movie when their car falls apart outside the downtown tax assessor's office.  ( ASIDE:  Among the many  urlLink memorable quotes from the movie  is this one from Elwood Blues -- "Our Lady of Blessed Acceleration, don't fail us now!")  Both Jennie and I knew that it was just a matter of time until the car broke down.  I had hoped and prayed that it would happen mercifully.  Last Tuesday, June 22nd, I drove Maxine to work.  I made a turn and must have hit a "chuck-hole" (aka "pot hole") in the road because when I got to the parking lot, I had some trouble steering the car into the parking spot.  After my shift I returned to the car to inspect whatever damage there was.  I saw that the front, driver's-side corner of the bumper had been bent to rub against the tire.  I got on the ground and bent the bumper away from the wheel.  Satisfied with that, I got in the car and started her up.  I put the car in gear and went forward (I had pulled into the parking spot in reverse earlier).  I went a few inches and felt the car fall forward.  I shut the engine off and went to inspect.  The front, driver's-side wheel had come off the axle!  That corner of the car was being supported by the wheel.  At once I felt grateful to God that it happened in a parking lot instead of on the street or worse, a highway.  I'm also glad that no one was hurt.  I returned to work, called Jennie, and walked home.  A half hour later, I walked back to the car, with two empty backpacks and a shoulder bag.  I got everything I wanted out of the car.  So it has sat for the past week at that same spot in the parking lot.  Since it's a high-traffic area (drive-thru, etc.), a number of people have asked about it.  Some have offered to tow it (that business card on the dashboard); others have offered to buy it or fix it.  Maxine is beyond repair.  I almost feel like I'd have to pay someone else to take her off our hands (lol)!  Yet if there is someone who wants to give us some money for her, then Amen!  Something else that's interesting... At the beginning of the month we had gotten 30-day temporary tags and some insurance for the car.  We knew that it didn't have a chance in h*** of passing the emissions inspection.  We had discovered that the only way to get out of an insurance policy is if the car would break down.  So, in general, we can see how God is blessing us.  Our lives are more complicated (Jennie works 3rd shift, for example) by not having a car, but we're managing, for the meantime.

      For the time being, anyway.  I decided to install one of those trial CDs that AOL sent us via mail recently.  After some poking, prodding, many reboots (our PC is 5 years old), I finally got us connected.  It had been nearly two weeks since I last logged on at the library, and my mailboxes were in much need of cleaning out.  So much to catch up on.  It will have to happen later, though.  I have to get to bed.  I have a therapist appointment later today at 10 AM.

      A mother and her son were flying Southwest Airlines from Kansas City to Chicago. The son, who had been looking out the window, turned to his mother and asked, "If big dogs have baby dogs and big cats have baby cats, why don't big planes have baby planes?"   The mother, who couldn't think of an answer, told her son to ask the flight attendant.   So the boy asked the flight attendant, "If big dogs have baby dogs and big cats have baby cats, why don't big planes have baby planes?"   The flight attendant responded, "Did your mother tell you to ask me?"  The boy admitted that this was the case.   "Well, then," she replied, "tell your mother that there are no baby planes because Southwest always pulls out on time. Your mother can explain THAT to you."   And that's all I have to say about that.  Thanks to  urlLink Mom  for forwarding  urlLink Karen 's email!

      Two little kids are in a hospital, lying on gurneys next to each other outside the operating room. The first kid leans over and asks, "What are you in here for?" The second kid says, "I'm in here to get my tonsils out and I'm a little nervous."  The first kid says, "You've got nothing to worry about. I had that done when I was four. They put you to sleep, and when you wake up they give you lots of Jell-O and ice cream. It's a breeze."  The second kid then asks, "What are you here for?"  The first kid says, "A  urlLink circumcision ."  The second kid says, "Whoa, Good luck, buddy, I had that done when I was born...Couldn't walk for a year."

      Not being able to get online that much has helped me to have more balance in my life.  I used to spend so much time online that ignored everything else around me.  I'm reading more now.  Books and newspapers.  I really enjoy crossword puzzles, too.  I read this great book by Kathy Buckley entitled  urlLink If You Could Hear What I See .  Fantastic!  I've just been told that I have a few more minutes before the library closes.

      Greetings once again from the library!  Yesterday I spent some time toying with the home PC.  Our 19" monitor had gone out, so I plugged in a 13- or 15-inch one a friend gave us.  It appears to be working okay, except that I have to use 800x600 resolution now.  Also the buttons that stretch the screen vertically and horizontally are stuck right now.  Fortunately, this happened after I got the screen to a decent size!  We also have an HP All-in-One printer/scanner/copier/fax, and it has been behaving badly.  I replaced the black ink cartridge, and now it incessantly tells us that we need to insert/reinsert the color ink cartridge.  We'll need to wait awhile to purchase a new color cartridge to see if that works, but for now, it exists as a nice paperweight.  The big reason for this is that we're having to get temp tags and insurance for the car Mom has given us, a 1983 Datsun Maxima.  It had been registered and insured in her name during the past year.  On Saturday I called around and got Jennie and I a 6-month policy for the car.  I don't know whether the car will last that long, but we'll see.  We need to have proof of insurance documents in order to get temporary license tags, so I asked the representative to fax us the documents.  Needless to say, they didn't come through.  Yesterday I saw that the PC had QuickLink, some faxing software that came with it.  We'd never used it before, but I figured it was worth trying out.  Jennie called the folks at the insurance company this morning, and they faxed the documents to our PC.  I was then able to save them to a diskette to bring to the library to print out.  Unfortunately, they won't come up in any of the office applications.  I think we'll have to return home, save the documents in a more ubiquitously-known file format, and then come back here to the library to print them out.

      I previously mentioned that  urlLink Maxine Is Dead .  Maxine was the name of the 1983 Nissan Maxima that Mom gave us when she moved back to Texas.  Since then I've been trying to arrange for her final disposition.  The most expedient way of taking care of her was to give her to  urlLink Goodwill .  Today they sent someone to pick her up.  How nice to have that finished.  The car broke down at work, and they had been very patient as I've arranged to take care of it.  As the days and weeks passed, however, I would often feel guilty for not doing more to resolve it.  Now that she's gone, I can relax a bit.

      Some readers may be aware that my daughter Keisha is hard of hearing.  She has worn hearing aids since she was three years old.  For about four years then.  Keisha's hearing loss is called "sensineural" (or sensorineural - my spelling may be off).  It was described to Jennie (my wife) and I that her cochleas were not completely formed when she was born.  I found the " urlLink Bionic Ear Blog " among the  urlLink Google Search Results for "sensineural hearing loss" .  It describes Meryl's adventures in getting a cochlear implant.  She has the same type of hearing loss that our Keisha has.  I look forward to reading more.

      This morning Mom sent an email to her family members about her Mom:  This is to remind everyone Mom would have celebrated her 89th birthday today.  I know we all wish she were here to celebrate with together. However take a minute to pause and just thank her for the contribution she made to your life personally.  I think that would be a great way to honor her today.  I think of all you daily and with much love, Margie  My grandma, Loraine Mitchell, died when I was in kindgergarten (1975).  The only thing I remember about it was when my Mom took me back to school.  She told my teacher that if I looked like I was feeling down, it was probably because of Grandma's funeral.  I don't remember a whole lot about my grandma.  I remember that Steph(my sister) and I would visit her and Gramps at their home at 52 Graham Street in Cincinnati.  She would make us "brown cows" and "pink cows" (drinks made with ice cream and either root beer or cream soda, respectively).  I also remember that she showed us how to make a flower using some facial tissue, a pipe cleaner, and a little spritz of cologne.  We would fold the tissue alternatively, like you would to make a fan.  Then we would wrap an end of the pipe cleaner around the middle of the folded tissue.  After that we would carefully peel the tissue up on both sides to create the petals of the flower.  Then we'd spray a small amount of cologne to give our flower a scent.  I vaguely remember she called me "Little Bit."  It turns out that she was petite herself, not much taller than 59 inches.  I see a lot of her facial features in my aunts and uncles, and sometimes in me.  She also had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which contributed to her death.  I found some posts from Mom's blog about it from the April 2003, when Mom had an echo cardiogram done:   urlLink Familial Dilated Cardiomyopathy Project   Mom's personal reflection on  urlLink being with her mother (my grandma) during her last days   I encourage you all to pray for my Mom.  She has always been prone to feeling down on birth and death anniversaries.    crossposted to  urlLink Me, Myself, and I

      That how I'm feeling right now.  I have a flurry of thoughts in my head, like a whirlwind.  I like being able to blog because I can type faster than I write, and it's more legible.  I use blogging to dump my brain.  I don't expect that anything will be completely cogent.  I realized this morning at church that I've gotten into the old habit of spending an unhealthy amount of time online.  I'm going to have to limit myself to an hour; otherwise, I won't get anything else done.  In reading Driven to Distraction, Dr. Hallowell describes some practical ways of managing life with ADHD.  The big thing is structure.  I realize that some of this comes second nature to most people, but it doesn't to me.  I struggle with a low self-esteem, too.  Big time.  I am very sensitive to criticism, both from others and myself.  Myself especially.  Just some thoughts.

      I having trouble staying awake to type this blog post.  What a day.  This morning Jennie caught the bus to a podiatrist follow-up appointment.  She left before Keisha left for school.  Shortly after that, two contractors arrived to fix a leaking problem we've had near our storm patio door.  They removed the entire assembly and added some flashing.  I had to leave for work before they were finished.  They locked up when they were done.  I rode the bike to work, listening to my new MP3 player along the way.  Music and cycling go together like peas and carrots.  I arrived at work almost 15 minutes late, and I hit the ground running.  After we'd switched from the breakfast to lunch menu, our crew trainer asked if anyone wanted to volunteer for the grill.  Not many hands went up, so I volunteered.  That meant that, from 10:45 to 3 I was non-stop at the grill.  Because of how my schedule is set up, I do not often get sent on a break, especially when the restaurant is hoppin' busy.  I left work at 3 and rode the bike home.  I showered -- much needed from sweat and the general "working around a grill" smell.  Afterward, Jennie and I watched "A Beautiful Mind", which we'd checked out recently from the library.  Having seen it, I now understand why it was so critically acclaimed two years ago and why it won so many Academy Awards.  We ate dinner, and Jennie went to bed for awhile before she had to get ready to go to work.  Keisha and I cleaned up.  After that, I grabbed my guitar and started strumming, practicing, whatever you want to call it.  Keisha requested that I play "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing", which is in one of the songbooks I borrowed from the library.  I showed her how to follow along with the words as I played.  That was fun.  I tried "Down By The Riverside", but she wasn't as interested in singing along.  Then I sat down and played this song called "The Window", which I got out of a campfire songbook, which I, of course, borrowed from the library.  "The Window" takes the first couple of lines from a nursery rhyme and ends it with "out the window.  For example  Mary had a little lamb Its fleece was white as snow And everywhere that Mary went She threw it out the window  The window, the window The second story window If you don't know your nursery rhymes We'll throw you out the window  You do this with as many nursery rhymes as you can remember.  We did "Humpty Dumpty" and "Three Little Kittens", too.  Then I played "Down by the Bay", which I had first heard from Raffi about seven years ago.  It's one of those "add a verse" songs, too.  For instance  Down by the bay Where the watermelons grow Back to my home I dare not go For if I do My mother will say:  Did you ever see a goose Kissing a moose?  Down by the bay  Keisha and I would take turns with the rhyming part.  She started getting really goofy by coming up with her own rhyming words for stuff.  After she'd say her part, she'd crack up laughing.  That was so much fun.  Finally, I put the guitar away, and we snuggled up on the couch to finish this book we'd checked out from the library.  It's a children's poetry book entitled   urlLink Love That Dog  .  I read most of the words for time's sake, but I let Keisha read some bits and pieces.  It was a really good book.  It's a story about a young student named Jack who is exploring poetry and, in looking for inspiration, finds it in a dog.

      We rent movies; we usually check them out from the library.  When I am in the market for a movie to own, I don't just go out and buy any movie.  I would like to have seen it first.  Then it has to be something I would like to have added to our collection.  It's gotta be something special.  But not too pricey.  So, a couple months ago, when I got a Blockbuster video gift card for $10, I stashed it away for awhile.  I happen to work next door to one of their stores, and yet, until today, I hadn't gone in to redeem the gift card.  After work I went to the store, and first browsed their "Previously Viewed" collections, which are on sale for less than a brand new copy would be.  I then made my way around the outer walls of the store, examining the selections they were renting.  I was trying to think of any titles that were on my favorites list.  I then ventured to the alphabetized collection.  Some of the movies I would like to have were too pricey for me.  Finally, I settled for the  urlLink Sleepers DVD .  I saw the movie some years ago, and I bought the book at  urlLink Half Price Books  awhile back.  I had requested the movie from the library, but it wasn't in their collection, and the request eventually expired.  So, we'll see.

I'd only had the  urlLink Ask the Danimal  box on this blog for a day, and I was notified that someone asked this question:  What causes the vehicle to fail an ASM vehicle emissions test?  My first thought was... Why do I care?  I later decided that I could at least try to find out  something .  I was curious to find out what ASM stood for.  So I did.  What?  I'm not going to reproduce the answer for you here. ;P  You ask the question yourself.

      "Isn't science wonderful?" says my Dad when he shares something inventive or the like with me and others.  It generally is stated with a slight bit of sarcasm; I mean, after all, not everything depends on science.  Or does it?  Maybe I should get to the point here.  I think it's rather interesting that I've begun to pose that same question in the same manner when I've come across something that I find pretty cool.  Such is the case with the  urlLink My Qbox , which I've recently added to the blog sidebar.  With it I am able to set up my own knowledge base.  I figure that it is the next step from a  urlLink Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page .  I've only begun to add answers to questions.  I've already tried it out with some of the same questions that are on  urlLink my FAQ .  Pretty cool so far.  So, there it is, folks!  Feel free to ask me a question.

      Greetings from the Northtown-Shiloh Branch of the  urlLink Dayton Metro Library .  I am making my way home from a therapist appointment I had this afternoon in Kettering, Ohio.  Shortly after 12 Noon I left home on my bike, and I rode from Turner Rd (Needmore Rd) to Riverside Drive.  I got onto Riverside and rode all the way to where it meets the Bike Trail.  I got on the bike trail and continued to Stewart Road.  From Stewart I turned onto Patterson and headed the rest of the way to my appointment.  I haven't gone on such an extensive bike ride in a very long time.  I was so tired when I finally got to my appointment (15 minutes late), that I decided to catch the bus back home.  My therapist is an avid cyclist himself, and he estimates that I rode over 8 miles to get to my appointment.  I saw this morning that I have items on hold for me here, so I stopped off to pick them up.  Jennie and Keisha are on their own adventure this afternoon.  Keisha is having her annual physical at the pediatrician's office near the Englewood Meijer.  I know that Jennie is going to be flat-out exhausted, since she worked last night and hasn't caught up on her sleep.

      Yesterday evening after dinner Keisha and I took Jake outside.  While he did his business, she and I made some chalk drawings in the parking lot.  At first we did some random stuff.  Keisha drew a picture of a sun, a tree, and some clouds.  I drew something that resembled a sine wave and proceeded to add facial features to each hump of the design.  Then I wrote the following:  You can pick your nose You can pick your friends But you can not pick your friend's NOSE!  Keisha and I wrote our names vertically.  I added descriptive words that begin with each letter of our names while she drew pictures of things that begin with the letters in our names.  In parentheses are the pictures she drew:  Kind (Kite)  Enjoys (Easter egg)  Inventive (Ice cream cone)  Smart (Snake)  Happy (Happy face)  Artistic (Apple)    Daredevil (Dinosaur)  Artistic (Ant)  Nutsy (Nose)  Then I walked around the area and wrote words with arrows pointing to the objects they described; for example, light, dumpster, parking space, peeing stone (for Jake the dog).  We then walked back to our apartment building and did some chalk stuff there.  I wrote more words with arrows; for example, lamp post, tree, retaining wall.  Then I felt a little bored, so I started writing the license plate numbers of cars that were parked in front of the sidewalk.  I also wrote  Take trash out This way  with an arrow pointing toward the dumpster.  Finally, I noticed this Ford Bronco that has been sitting for as long as I can remember in the same spot.  Once, when the tires had gone flat, the apartment company management stuck a Tow sticker on it.  The owner reinflated the tires and removed the sticker.  I wrote in front of the car on the sidewalk: Does this Bronco ever move? I spoke with Mom on the phone last night and mentioned our chalking escapades.  She said I should be careful because someone might want to kick my butt.

        By The Associated Press   FOND DU LAC, Wis. - Chalk up another meaty milestone for Don Gorske. The Fond du Lac man downed his 20,000th Big Mac sandwich Monday, while surrounded by spectators at a local McDonald's restaurant.   He already had made the "Guinness World Records" book for eating a record number of Big Macs before he hit number 19,000 in March 2003.   He has been eating the fast food sandwiches since 1972 at a rate of at least one a day, and said he has eaten a Big Mac from every state in the union.   Still, the 6-foot Gorske has maintained his weight at about 170 pounds.  I guess there are any number of ways to become famous.  With that  urlLink Sony promotion going on , I wonder if he's been racking up the free music.

      Work today went really well.  I typically spend from 10 to 10:15 cleaning up around the grill and fried food area.  At 10:15 I drop all the fried food for lunch.  When I say drop, I mean place the food into the fryer vats and set the timers for the food to cook.  While the fried food cooks, I get trays to put the cooked food into so that they can be placed into staging cabinets.  Also I get ready to disconnect the breakfast equipment and move it out of the way so that the crew can focus on the regular menu.  This occurs at 10:30 within a few seconds.  After the condiment table, bun toaster, and other equipment was in place, one manager asked me to take care of the trash and cardboard.  I went through the walk-in refrigerator and freezer, along with the stockroom (where the dry goods are stored), to collect empty cardboard boxes.  One of the crew members gave me her car keys so that I could put as many of the boxes I had into her car.  She needs them for an upcoming move.  After I did that, I took the rest of the cardboard to the cardboard dumpster.  When I opened the lid to the dumpster, I was grateful that my coworker had taken so many of the boxes.  I could barely put any of the boxes I had into the dumpster because it was practically full.  I then returned to take all the trash bags to the dumpster.  I guess it wouldn't be called trash if it didn't stink and make you think of vomiting on yourself.  Nevertheless, I put all the trash bags into the compactor and turned it on.  One bag was particularly nasty.  It wasn't closed that well, and someone had placed it in the trash container upside down.  It was juicy.  Yeah, I guess that's a good word to describe it.  Heavy, too.  After I'd emptied the trash container, I needed to rinse it out because there were, um, juices left over.  It was also a good time to rinse my hands and forearms off.  I had to do the same thing with the cardboard container because it had some trash in it.  When I'd returned from that task, they needed me to take over the grill.  Working the grill is nonstop during the day.  I'm always cooking meat.  The challenge is to cook just enough so that the crew doesn't run out while not cooking too much.  Management has prepared charts that indicate how much we should keep in the staging cabinet.  The process involves timing, stamina, and endurance.  Today was a great day to work the grill.  I worked with some really great crew members, too.  I was happy as long as I had the meat to cook and I got cups of ice water every so often.  I didn't even notice that it was past the time for me to get off.  The crew still needed someone to cook the meat, and management hadn't provided someone to replace me yet.  I also didn't get a break, which happens sometimes because of how my shift is laid out with respect to how busy the restaurant is.

      A couple had two little boys, ages 8 and 10, who were excessively mischievous.   The boys were so good at getting into trouble that their parents knew if any mischief occurred in their town, their sons were probably involved.   The boys' mother heard that a clergyman in town had been successful in disciplining children, so she asked if he would speak with her boys.   The clergyman agreed, but asked to see them individually.   So the mother sent her 8-year-old in first that morning, with the older boy to see the clergyman in the afternoon.   The clergyman, a huge man with a booming voice, sat the younger boy down and asked him sternly, "Where is God?"  The boy's mouth dropped open, but he made no response, sitting there with his mouth hanging open, wide eyed.  So the clergyman repeated the question in an even sterner tone, "Where is God!!?"    Again the boy made no attempt to answer.    So the clergyman raised his voice even more and shook his finger in the boy's face and bellowed, " WHERE IS GOD!? "    The boy screamed and bolted from the room, ran directly home and dove into his closet, slamming the door behind him.  When his older brother found him in the closet, he asked, "What happened?"    The younger brother, gasping for breath, replied, "We are in  BIG  trouble this time, dude. God is missing-and they think  WE  did it.!"

      Below is the HTML code used for the  urlLink previous post, Help Make Blogs More Visible .  To make it display, I've enclosed it with the &lt;XMP&gt; tag, which I uncovered at the  urlLink Lycos Webmaster - Display HTML code  page.  Hopefully this will make it easier to copy and paste into other blogs without having to copy/paste each individual hyperlink.  Help Make Blogs More Visible!  NOTE: Be sure you paste live links for the Path List below.  There are by some estimates more than a million weblogs. But most of them get no visibility in search engines. Only a few "A-List" blogs get into the top search engine results for a given topic, while the majority of blogs just don't get noticed. The reason is that the smaller blogs don't have enough links pointing to them. But this posting could solve that. Let's help the smaller blogs get more visibility!  This posting is  urlLink GoMeme 4.0 . It is part of an experiment to see if we can create a blog posting that helps 1000's of blogs get higher rankings in Google.

      I was running late for work, as usual.  I brought the bike out, backpack on, and began the trek to work.  I quickly shifted to the higher gears.  I have a slight hill to go down before I make the turn onto Main Street.  I saw that I had the green light, so I shifted to 15th gear (the highest) and started pedaling as fast as I could.  By the time I made the turn, I was probably going about 25-30 mph.  Work's parking lot is less than 1/4 mile, and I saw that I had a clear turn, so I kept on going at top speed.  As I turned into the parking lot, I had to turn the front wheel hard to compensate for how fast I was going.  I didn't have control of the bike, and before I knew it, I'd crashed into a flowerbed, landing on the ground.  Fortunately, I was wearing a bike helmet.  After a few seconds, I got up and walked the bike, which was noticeably different in its behavior, to the lamp post and locked it up.  I hurried inside, removed my helmet, and clocked in.  One of the managers noticed that the back of my shirt was dirty from the fall and had me change into a clean one.  In the restroom, as I removed my dirty shirt, I saw that I had a scrape on the bottom right side of my belly.  I also had scraped a little piece of skin from my left pinky finger.  Throughout the night I had a headache, and, by the time I came home my right hip was feeling sore, too.  As I left work, I saw that the bike chain had derailed.  I put it back on the gears and tested it out.  It turns out that the rear tire is seriously warped.  Also the seat is loose; I had to adjust it while I was riding home.  I mentioned the accident to Jennie when I got home.  She encouraged me to put some ice on and take some anti-inflammatory medicine.  She also said I should have told my bosses and had them send me to the ER.  I didn't think that was necessary at the time.  I'll probably need to get a new back tire.  Ugh.  I've only had this bike for less than three months!

      I saw the link to this website at  urlLink Carla's blog, Across the Pond .  Here's an excerpt from their  urlLink About Us page :  Since 1995, The Diabetic Gourmet Magazine has been the premiere online magazine dedicated to diabetes related health issues as well as diabetic dining and cooking information. It is composed of original content written and designed by our editorial staff, material offered to us for publication by agencies such as FDA, CDC, NIDDK, and USDA, and material contributed by seasoned food editors, authors, specialists and journalists. We believe that the diet of the diabetic gourmet should be seen as selective, not restrictive.

       JENNIE   Jennie has been feeling really depressed.  I guess you could say that she's been that way for quite some time.  Other emotions: anger, resentment, frustration.  I've felt these same feelings and have often shared them here.  Yesterday morning she came home from work in time to head back out to an appointment.  I later saw her when she came into the restaurant where I work.  By the time I arrived home (circa 4:15 PM), she hadn't gone to bed yet.  She had a lot on her mind, and I let her talk.  Then I got a little scared when she said she was having suicidal thoughts.  Whereas I use self-injury to cope, she uses food, namely sugar.  I'd been urging her to call the Crisis Care hotline so that she could speak with someone, and even get help for her depression, etc.  Finally, I called the number and handed the phone to her.  She talked with a woman on the phone for some time.  This woman asked if she wanted to go to their office last night; Jennie said she was feeling like she'd be okay just to go in tomorrow (this morning).  So she made an appointment for 10 AM.  I remember, two years ago, when my mom first moved up here, that my mom wound up in the hospital for a week.  I really hope that isn't necessary for Jennie, although I have to consider the possibility.  I feel sad and a little worried for my wife.  She is the love of my life, and I want her to feel better.  I've seen her pull back from God so much over these past couple of years.  I've encouraged her to draw near to him, thinking that, maybe he's allowing all the things that are going on to happen so that she will turn back to him.  "What if God is allowing all this to happen to humble you?" I inquired gently.  She has expressed that she feels it's useless to pray.  It's as though doing all the spiritual things like praying, studying the Bible, meeting with others, are not working.  I know I've felt that way at times myself.  I told her that I was committed to being there for her no matter what.  When we got married, I sang Steven Curtis Chapman's song "I Will Be Here" to her as part of my wedding vows.  I told her that I Will Be Here no matter what happens.  I need to be careful of using pat phrases like that, however.  Because they can and have been overused, in time they seem to lose their meaning.  It's a little bit like singing the same songs again and again at church; after awhile we get so used to the words that we stop meditating on their meaning.    KEISHA   Keisha has also had a tough week.  Her school is conducting Terra Nova testing, which is supposed to give an idea of how kids might perform on future standardized tests.  I guess it also may indicate where the school can improve in their instruction, etc.  She loves to read, which fires Jennie and I up to no end.  It's becoming so common for her to pick up a picture book we get from the library and read it out loud to us.  Some of the multi-syllable words I help her sound out.  Then after she's read it to me, I sometimes review it with her to verify she understood what the story was about.  I love going to the library to pick out books for her.  Because I want reading to be fun and the time we read together to be fun, I've opted for Humor books.  Our library places a humor sticker on those books deemed as such, which makes them easy to spot.  Keisha also loves to draw.  It's evident in that her default activity is to grab some paper and some crayons, markers, etc. and start drawing.  But math appears to be a bit more difficult.  Perhaps it's because it can be rather abstract to see numbers on a page and not be able to instinctively see their meanings.  I try to think back to when I was learning addition and subtraction and how I was.  Unfortunately, I cannot remember.  She also gets easily frustrated when she's not picking the information up.  I'm challenged by this because I can be the same way.  I also have to be careful not to get impatient with her and be sure to encourage her.  There were some particular problems she had for homework that were bothering her.  I finally had the idea to use pennies out of her bank as visual aids.  That seemed to help.  What helped even more, according to Keisha, was that I was there to help her.  I'm not a psychiatrist and I know I'm not qualified to diagnose my daughter, but, as someone with ADHD, I can say that I see some signs of it with her.  As I would talk with her about her homework, she would play with her pencil and eraser - distracted.  I found that frustrating because I felt that she wasn't paying attention to me.   ME   I'm learning to take advantage of my day planner.  I look forward to using colors, etc. to make appointments, etc. stand out.  (I realize that this might sound a bit strange to you all.)  If I can make my organization system fun, colorful, and interesting, then I think I'll have a good chance of keeping up with it.  I would love to have a coach; someone to help keep me on track, etc.  I'm learning to use timers: for example, the kitchen timer has gone off four times since I began this post to remind me that I need to leave for work.  My watch alarm has a "snooze button" effect in which it sounds five minutes after I touch the particular button.  I use that to remind me that I need to take my medicine and when I need to get ready to leave work, among other things.  I'm using other alarm clocks, too.  I hope that eventually stuff like this will become second nature to me and help me be more effective.  There is so much more that I could probably talk about - I need to talk about - but I need to go for now.  (like we found out yesterday that our Transitional Medicaid expires at the end of this month for Jennie and I.  This means we'll have no insurance. Ugh!)  Pray for us.

        "It's 'Rafe', actually."  -- Ralph Fiennes,  from the  urlLink IMDB Biography for Ralph Fiennes   The 41-year old actor has recently been confirmed to play the role of Voldemort, aka He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and You-Know-Who.  Until now, we've only known Voldy in spirit; that is, he has not been a full character in the flesh.  That changes in the fourth installment of the Harry Potter series.

      This comes via email from Brian B.:  I am passing this on to you because it has definitely worked for me...and as we start summer we all could use a little calm, by following the simple advice I read in an article.  I have finally found inner peace. The article read: "The way to achieve inner peace is to finish all the things you've started"  So I looked around the house to see all the things I started and hadn't finished... and before leaving the house this morning, I finished off a bottle of red wine, a bottle of white wine, the Bailey's, Kahlua and Wild Turkey, the Prozac, some valium, some cheesecake and a box of chocolates.  You have no idea how freakin' good I feel... You may pass this on to those you feel are in need of Inner Peace.

      Also from KidsHealth:  Every night across America, 5 to 7 million children are turning off the lights, going to sleep, and wetting their beds.  The medical name for bedwetting is  enuresis  - "the involuntary voiding of urine beyond the age of anticipated control" - and it's a common condition in children. It's also a very stressful one for parents and children alike. For the child wetting the bed, it's often a major embarrassment. For parents, there may be a mixture of annoyance and sometimes a little anger. They wonder if bedwetting is done on purpose or because of laziness.  urlLink Read more...

      This morning Jennie, Keisha, and I caught the bus to church.  Most of the congregation is camping at Hocking Hills, located in southeastern Ohio, but some members, such as us, stayed home.  It really helps to plan trips like these in advance.  We took the 7 south to Main & Third, i.e., the epicenter of Dayton, Ohio (the hub from which all major  urlLink RTA  activity occurs).  Then we transferred to the number 5, which took us down Far Hills Avenue just past Dorothy Lane.  From there we walked 1/4 mile to our friends' home, where we had a house church service.  I really am glad we went because it wasn't just a communion service.  We alternated singing songs about the cross with reading passages from the Bible about the cross.  Nearly everyone in attendance got to read.  It felt like I was hearing some of these passages for the first time, in some cases.  The one I read was  urlLink Colossians 1:15-23  and  urlLink 2:13-15   After the service, we walked back to the bus stop.  I saw that the next bus would not arrive for another 50 minutes.  So we walked about 3/4 mile north to the  urlLink Dorothy Lane Market .  Jennie bought a smoothie while Keisha and I got some bottled water.  We then walked to the closest bus stop and waited.  Now we're home, and we'd all love to take a nap.  Jennie, however, has just put some laundry in.  I'll be heading to work in an hour.  Jennie will be going into work this evening.  May God give us strength.
