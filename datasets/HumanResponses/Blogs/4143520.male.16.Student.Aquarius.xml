      In my last post i talked about one special person. This person had a crush on me. For over a half year she said nothing and then as she told me i said that she's too young. Great. It was OK for me because i felt nothing at this moment. And she wasn't to attractive to me. A normal girl. Not a 'hot chick'.  Two Month ago. 4-5 month after i told her she's not the type of girl i prefer the feeling i could have missed something(or someone...) came up in me. Maybe she's not that bad... Maybe i missed a big chance. Maybe it's wonderful being in a "relationship" with her.. Ok, long story short: I fell in love. But i didn't have her number. She changed her old number and i had no chance to call her.. After over a month of talking about this thing with friends i decided to call her at home.  I was scared. Scared as hell and i never got her on the phone after three times of trying. Today i called again. And guess what? She was on the phone. Wow. But guess again? She had no more interest.  Haha. My hope was totally destroyed by just one call and two minutes of talking.  P.S.: My english is waaaay to bad to explain the whole story...

      When I think of a special person in my life something in me starts. It's a special person. And I'm starting to think of wonderful things in life which i can do with this person. My mind paints this colorful pictures and makes me happy. I'm happy to think about that. These "pictures" and beliefs are different to each other. But they got one thing in common: they're all about being together with this special person. Life could be so wonderful if i would do a step towards this person. But I'm scared.  I'm scared because when i think too much about this person I'm starting to destroy this pictures. Splashes of black ink all over the colorful pictures and some little holes in the canvas are getting bigger and bigger. And then I don't want to make the step trying out how life could be with this person. I make a big step back and say to me that i don't like it.  Why?  I want to know why I'm doing this. It destroys everything. But hey.. there is nothing. Nothing it can destroy. But I should start making something. Making a step and have a look how life would be. Mhh....  PS: Seems like this was a pseudo-intellectual post. Hm. But i thought about that last night and felt I need to write my thoughts down. Wherever it's possible.

      I'm just using  gnome-blog  and somehow i like it. It's simple and has a little "Blog" button on my gnome-panel. Though it doesn't support things like images are links for the blog. But i don't care. If i want to make a post with images in it, I'll go to the website and post it through the wysiwyg-editor.  If you (i saw an unknown person commented by last post, so maybe i got a few readers..) know any other bloggin-software for linux which uses gtk: let me know.    edit: Oh, i just saw that gnome-blog fucked up this post. It doesn't handle titles of postings and new-line-breaks. Damn.

      I got a new toy. A blog powered by  urlLink blogger.com.  The first thing you will notice is that i'm writing in english. Why that? I don't know. But i'm a reader of  urlLink Planet Gnome  and even the Indian writers and gnome hackers are writing in english. Ok, i'm not a famous person and am not involved in a planet * thing but hey.. why not. A good chance to higher my english skills (oh, i think i made i made a mistake here).  Because I write in english I changed the blog language to English. But i don't know if i should change the timezone too. Maybe to UTC? We'll see. Right now i'm pretty happy with blogger.com. It let's me host the blog on my own FTP has nice layouts. Not like  urlLink livejournal.com.  which had pretty ugly layouts for normal users. If you use a payed account you get more and nicer themes for your blog. The only bad thing with blogger is the incompatibility with my firefox browser. Somehow i cannot make a normal link without needing to look in the HTML code and fix the . If i don't it just makes the whole sentence a link. Sucks.  But hey, now i'm using blogger.com which means i can use gnome-blog too. So i'm going to emerge it after this first post. Ah, btw. i just finished  emerge -puD world , so let's have a look what i missed while playing Doom 3 the last days.. Six packages including a new version of Firefox.  What can you except on this blog? Not much, hehe. No, really, it's just a toy and i don't think this first message will be read by more than 3 people. So, have fun and enjoy the nice looking layout.  P.S.: I got a a atom-feed! Yay! So if you want to link me: go for it :P
