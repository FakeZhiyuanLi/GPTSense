      The internet phenomenon got me!! oh no... and, as true as i am, i revealed to the world my identity.   I never thought that i can reach the other planet through the tips of my fingers.  I was into a chatroom, using my own name of course.. then suddenly some guy from the farthest point in the world that i could imagine, sent me an instant message, "you look cute and sweet in the picture"... my panick buttons turned on, and i wailed, asking him "how did you see my pix".  so he taught me how, that i just need to right click my name and click view profile. so i did it, and voila! my pix popped out-- i was there in all my glory  revealing my full name, my whereabouts, and my personal page!!! That was supposed to be for people i am comfortable with! argh! i never realized that ... hahaha! So i removed everything, at least for my msn account only.  i should have known it right from the first entry i did on my blogspot, my webpage, and god knows whatever forums i've been into.!I think anonimity is now a deleted word in my dictionary.  I've revealed myself... oh well, it's not so bad at all. What do you think? =)  The world wide web is such an interesting place to conquer and my journey has just begun...

      This is not okey.  We have been planning this trip since like forever and it seems like, this is not going to push through soon. Tokyo is really expensive  and getting a japanese visa needs a lot.  The agency told me that our NSO certificate would be released 3 weeks after.  Then our japanese visa can only be processed after this time. And i need another 2 weeks before i can claim my travel award ticket since they need the visa first.  Oh my, looks like my tokyo holiday will be postponed.  I've been having sleepless nights thinking about it. Mt Fuji must really be a sight to behold and at least that would be added to my list of conquered wonders of the world.  Disneyland--ahhh! And fate adds to my pressure -- everytime i open the tv these days, what i see are travel guides to tokyo, sitcoms about japan, features about tokyo...oh my..  i hope this will really push through soon...argh!

      I want to write. I just don’t know where to start. I don’t know what facet of my life to describe as everything about it mesmerizes me.  I want to write about my heartaches and how these feelings shattered me. I want to write about my fears, how I have been so afraid of the unthinkable, of the would be sorrows and depressions. I want to write about the storms that bring the rainbows.  I want to write about my mom. I want to talk about her unconditional love, her pure soul, and loving smile. I want to write about how she has continuously moved me and inspire me to become the best.  I want to write about my dad, about his laughter, about his ordeals. I want to tell the world how my dad has been so proud of me and how he has been so amazed even with the littlest of my achievements.  I want to write about my brother, of how he opened my eyes. I want to talk about the pain in his heart and the sorrow he has gone through. I want to talk about how I would want to make the world a better place for him. I want to invade his soul and discover what’s inside him.  I want to write about my significant other. I want to boast of our love. I want the universe to know how he has touched my soul. I want to paint a picture of our dreams, of our story, of the trials that come along with our being apart. I want to detail the longing in my heart to be with him every waking moment of my life.  I want to write about the hard work I did the past weeks. I want to bring back the feelings of amazement, that despite the toil, I can still laugh. I want to describe how surprised I was when I saw the sun the following morning, the first time I stepped out of my workplace since the day before. I want to illustrate the tears amidst the smiles because I felt the energy draining my soul.  I want to write about how tears rolled down my face when one of my closest friends, walked down the aisle the other week. I want to shout the joy I felt for her, that finally, after everything, all ended well.  I want to write about my newfound friends, the so-called Magic 12. I want to create a portrait of each character. I want to describe the magic that instantly chained us amidst our differences and age gaps. I want the world to laugh about our silly antics, how we fought for our rights that almost caused us our jobs, and how we spent 12 hours and more each day in front of our computers in between curses and bad mouths.  I want to write how it dawned on me that I’m old - too old to dress up, too old to have crushes, too old to go night out. I want to write how my peers would tease me about it, how they always underscore the words AGE GAP, and how I was told to act my age.  I want to write. I’m just too afraid to start because I don’t know how to end. I don’t know how to halt the indescribable feeling each second brings, worthy to be written about.
