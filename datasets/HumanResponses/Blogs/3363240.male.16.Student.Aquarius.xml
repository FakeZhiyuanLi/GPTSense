      Yesterday was a strange day. In the morning I watched "The Emperors New Groove." It was really really funny.  I tried to start a bit of cleaning. It didn't exactly work, so I'm stuck with it all today, and homework and GARGH!  So Kaya came over, and when she came in I got an annoyed feeling off of her. She didn't seem to want to be here, so I felt really wierd. Which in turn (most likely) made her feel wierd, and caused much confusion, chaos, and un-needed awkwardness. We went to the beach, and I was really exhausted from the night before, and just felt like sitting down. So, Kaya thought I was mad/angry/sad/??? and things got a bit wierder. So I got really really really thirsty, so we went on a mission, first to hot dog on a stick, because of the lemonade. The line at hot dog on a stick was huge, so we decided to go to the mall. We don't really like the mall, so we just decided to go home. At home we decided that we both needed to relax. A friend of hers (Brooke) Had pot from the night before. So we drove over there to get it. We smoked one bowl...I felt a little sick (breakfast, mom cooked the food a little too raw) so I didn't want to smoke any more. Kaya said she didn't feel really high...it was just wierd pot. Didn't get you high. Just made you tired. Hungry. But not all giggly. So we started the Emperors new groove, and all of a sudden, I was rediculously horny. This pot made me fucking horny as hell! So we got down to buisness.......I don't know how to put it. I think she was offended by something I did. I dunno. Sorry for being so wierd yesterday. I had rotten breakfast two days iin a row. ~Elan p.s Comments?

      Today was really really fun! I went to math...and had a test...I feel pretty good about it....not too shabby at all. After that I went to history, and yet another test....feel purdy good about it too. After that lunch came, and Kaya came over. I was really embarrased that my room smelled so bad, so mad incentive to clean it. After that I went with her to my dad's studio...to help him a bit... I was teaching her to skate, and it was really really fun. So we were at the beach, just sittin there after a nice little lesson, and all of a sudden:  BAM!  Joe pops up out of nowhere. So we go with him to Perry's..where the bad music is blasting, and find out that Dan, Paris, David, and Sheila are all at the beach too! So we went and hung out with them. It was fun, and dan went on another mad speech of his. After  that , we wanted to go eat, so we decided to go to bay cities. I told dan paris and david to walk there, while I go to my house with kaya and joe, to drive to joe's to get moolah...but then we got a call saying....."bay cities is closed!!!" So we had to re-think. I picked them all up...and am by this point...really irritable...b/c I don't want to get my licence taken, and I still want to hang out with my friends. So bleh...I drove them anyway. We decided to go to the Co-Op and got a little bit of food there.  Kaya forgot her money, so I bought us a little something to eat. (So happy....so so happy) So we went to Dan's...and we ate and watched "Detroit Rock City" which was purdy funny. After that...I drove Kaya home...and we talked in my car, and I'm totally happy love style!  Much love goes out to everyone...for putting up with the insanity of me. and kaya...I didn't forget about today...I just didn't want to broadcast it...ya know? ~Elan P.s comments???

      Today was much fun indeed. I ditched first period....it was my first time ditching ever....oooh such a bad boy. After that I went to french, which was boring and in which I had a test. After that came lunch. At lunch we rehearsed "Inherit The Wind" a play about the scopes-monkey trial. After lunch came 5th period. Much much fun at 5th period. We did the play, and then watched another, laughed with friends much after making a jew/yiddish jargon list. After that I hula'd with leah....so much hilarity. And guess what *is insanely excited*??? KAYA CAME OVER TODAY!!! even though it was just for a little bit...it was still awesome!! I'm really happy to have her....like....suuuper happy. ~Elan comments??? even saying hello is a comment....

      Today, as mentioned in the title, was a new day. Amira came home last night and the whole time was one big grin and :-D I remember all the fun we had together before she left, and she's been pushing me to go to UCSC, so maaybe I will. Classes today were 25 minutes long, which was quite alright. Chem: More extra credit Math: Test ELECTIONS-was alright...I looked for Kaya, but I couldn't find her. French: grrrrrrr History: Carlin,  AGAIN  English: Finished Harvey, next is Inherit the Wind.  After english John came up to me, and he's totally instigating a friendship....super exciting.  We are gopnna go longboarding sometime....he's probably pro though, so I'm not sure I can live up to the expectations...but who cares, right?  Kaya is going to Japan....sounds like so much fun. I need to get her address before she goes....cuz I gotta write.  I'm purdy tired. Gonna go to guitar today.  I hope acupunctre was okay kaya.  ~Elan

      Well, school today was alright... Kinda boring.  Chem was alright, I did some extra credit work in class....that should help. Math....test posponed! I get to shtudy! We had a standardized test though...I really hate those. French was dull. As usual. After that was lunch. Thanks to dan and kaya for supporting the "elan needs sustinance foundation" After I got my food, I went to english to rehearse...but Leah didn't show up...so yeah. I returned to Kaya...and let slip that she said something mean a couple of times....I hope it doesn't bother her. It really has not affected my feelings for her, just kinda brought me off of the could for a sec, so its not even a problem. After lunch was History. We had to take the stupid standardized survey....but we watched George Carlin during the whole thing. So fucking hilarious. That man is so funny. Felix's class is awesome. After History was english. We started Caitie's play and its good shit. Class ended before we could finish...so we'll have to continue tomorrow. I also have to go to english AGAIN at lunch tomorrow to start preparing for Sanyu's play. Annoying. I miss mah Kayah. Much love to everyone. ~Elan

      Last night while I was talking to Kaya, she changed the story she told me about this summer. I felt really...i dunno...worthless to her? Yeah. So I finally let it out. The whole trust thing. She totally got it (of course she would have) and began changing. I am truley amazed at how much she cares...(I really really hope she's truthful about that.) See? Thats what I mean.  If she can't trust me...how can I trust what she says, or does? It just has felt too much like a lie. But I know her love is sincere.  I will wait as long as it takes (or as long as she wants) for her to really trust me. I made it clear to her that regardless of our situation, I would be there for her, because thats just the kind of person I am. I love her too mucho to let something like this bother me though. I've changed. I'm not lingering anymore, and I'm not scared anymore. I understand why she is still slightly atttached to her ex....which I guess is okay. I just thought about it...and regardless of how much you trusted him with yourself, why would you still be attached to him...after all the bad things he's done? I won't bother it though. He's a senior...it will be over soon.  Gotta head out, school time :-/

      wow. Gmail is really really cool.  urlLink kitzune@gmail.com  thats where you can reach me...I didn't want nale23...I don't know why. Elan was too short.  anyway....today was: okie dokie. I had the standardized testing again today...chemistry. Really really boring.  I'm a bit ahead in my reading for english....5 chapters ahead....I'm almost done with The Great Gatsby. I am growing to like it more as I read it....but its changing from the mediocre gatsby to the pretty darn okay gatsby. I see why everyone likes it so much.  French was absolutely bleh. But I left class to see Kaya for a minute....which was absolutely great.  English...I did Leah's play today...and I ruined it. I feel kinda bad...maybe I didn't ruin it.  Next is Caitie's play. I'm gonna do good in that one. I hung out with John today after school...and he's a really cool kid. much excitement.  After school was also rehearsal. I'm really sorry I couldn't meet you after school Kaya.  Much love to everyone.  ~Elan

      Hee hee....blong. This weekend was  quite  fancy. It was a tad out of control, too. Friday I drove up with mah muddah to the land of hella stoked, where many a shit went down. Friday before I left, I wanted to part with Kaya, and I gave her the impression that I was angry at her, which I really did not mean to do. So I drove all day to Marin...and had dinner (the chicken was a tad hard...) and then called Kaya. We talked and it was nice. On Saturday, my Broheim came over and it was a really really nice time. I really look up to him, and the usual shebang. After the shebang comes.....  The PART-AY  and thus Shimone (SHE-MOAN) drove me to Seth's house (Thanks for the ride sheem) where I found Seth and his friends having jello mixed with vodka...tasted like Robitussin...(sorry if I misspelled it) It was insane. Basically. -People got waaay too drunk. -Seth's friend got really sick and threw up -Seth got a blowjob -I really missed Kaya -Girls giving me the "eye"  and then sleep yadda yadda.  Sunday: THE BBQ!!!!!!!!! I am so proud to be on staff!!! It is really a dream come true. I hope Kaya can come someday. I'd love to share the family tradition with someone as important as her. I got a free shirt :)  Nobody knew me...except for everyone knew me.  And that ends the weekend.

      I'm so fucking annoyed. My english and french grades dropped to an 88%, tossing my gpa from a 3.7 to a 3.5 What really annoyed me is that my parents were pissed. I left school on the last day with: B A A A A So anything after that was out of my control....yet I'm still do blame. Bleh....this is complaining, but that's what these things are for, right? ~Elan comment?

      I know I'm complaining....but its neccesary. We went to riddick today....I thought it sucked....but whatever. After that we went to get boba because I wanted to....and I saw leah...we said hi, and she told me she had my book for me (I let her borrow "The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail",) so I said "YAY! can I get it?" so I went to her house for a couple of minutes to get it. We ended up talking for a while, having some laughs....and when I get back to dan, david, erik, and joe....they are all angry...with good reason...but they had each other..so I didn't understand why it was so vital that I left. It wasn't even for that long.  So when I get back, dan starts giving me shit...so I said that I was sorry, but he said "dude...I would never do that" (or something like that) and I got pissed, because he's done that to me before...it was just stupid...he should have stopped it there, but then he said "and especially that you have a girlfriend, I would never do that."  I was totally fucking pissed. For dan to doubt my loyalty to kaya was unneccesary, and rude, and just FUCKING ASSHOLE It ruined my day. It really hurt me. He of all people should know how much I love her, and how faithful I am to her. Man.....I was totally miserable. I still kinda am. It hurt me so bad....to be doubted on that.....I love her with all my heart and soul, and show it with pride...and for him to say that he doubted me..made me feel like I was doing nothing. so after that we got food, and went to davids house to have a fire...and while I "let it pass" I was fuming inside....I needed an outlet...and there wasn't one. Then kaya called and said she was in little japan town. We went, and I was so happy to see her....it made me feel happy again. It was really brief, but fun. We also saw David....which was super fucking strange. I really dislike him....but meh.  When I got home...I felt inspired to make a background...and I made one...I really like it. I'll figure out how to host it somewhere. ~Elan p.s COMMENT PLEASE I NEED THE LOVE

I hope I still am....I don't think there is a reason not to...unless a hot indian (utah guy) came up and was better than me.  I don't think that happened though. She'll be free free on monday...and I can wait. All my love ~Elan p.s COMMENT!!!!!

      Well, today I'm doing a survey with dan and we are gonna get $200, each! and its awesome.  I saw supersize me last night.....unbelievable....scary. I called Kaya this morning...she's coming back, but she was busy, so we couldn't talk. I had a wierd dream about her two nights ago.... I was on 17th and wilshire....and for some reason about 10 of my middle school classmates were there. All of a sudden, I saw Kaya walking, and I thought "aren't you in utah?" So I ran up to her and asked, and when I got to her, she cried out, and began to run. She ran away from me, so I ran after, because I wanted to know why....and when I almost reached her, she turned around, said "I need to be away from you, go away." and dissapeared. I woke up and felt like ?????????????????????????????????????!?!?!?!?!????? it was confusing. I love ya'all ~Elan

      Well, it has been an eventful week. I realise I've been falling behind on my scedule of updates....but man, its been busy. School is out. YES!!!! Friday was Michelle's (cousin) graduation. It was super fly illitude. I'm at dan and joes now, sleeping here for the first time in I think, ONE FUCKING BILLION YEARS! It will be very fun. I jammed with cricket today, and it was totally kickass. I was loving having another guitarist that can play to play with. I wanted to see Kaya before she left, and the circumstances didn't let me. I was putting all my plans on hold to see her before she left, but then my cousins cancelled, I called Kaya, and we decided she'd call me when she finished what it was she was doing. I went to dan and joes, and my dad called me and was very angry. Because apparently my cousins had showed up.  Right before my dad called, i had been at at D&J's for about 5 minutes, when kaya called and said that she was done. I was like ARGH! because I was really tired. And I was about to call her back and tell her I wanted to come over...but that was when my dad called. So! last night was the last night everyone was here, and the last graduation party. We went to frito misto for dinner. After dinner, we hung out in my room and played DDR, when Michelle asked if we wanted to get stoned with her friends, so we were okay with that. We went to to her friends house, which was like, 45 minutes away, and just smoked out of his bongazoid, I went home and went to sleep. I'm over the drugs thing...but its alright to do every once in a while. Last night was like, my third time this year.  But, as it is 12:25 am.... I'm not at my computer. so I'll see ya'all later. ~Elan p.s I love you Kaya Comments?

      I just realized what I did, and it was probably the most tactless stupid thing I possibly could have done. So I want the whole world to know   I'm sorry   It was just stress built up, and overreacting, and stupid and not nice, and not nice at all.  All my love, and I hope I am forgiven ~Elan

      I need to vent. So here goes. I love Kaya with all my heart, and sometimes I don't feel like she is willing to "give" her love back. I still feel like she is closing herself off to me, but in different ways now. No sympathy, harsh truth. It sucks...because I'm a guy who needs that kind of love. I think that (hypothesis....not in any way meant to offend, or assume) she feels that is she throws over the last wall, which is sympathy, then she will be hurt. I am not that kind of guy. I'm not her ex, and I'm not anyone else. I'm not going to hurt her. I'm going to do everything in my power to  not  hurt her. I don't want to feel this anymore. I feel love everywhere from her, but when we talk on the phone, it changes....I feel like I'm always yakking, with no point. For instance, right now, I'm sitting in complete silence. I'm not talking, and neither is she. It hurt a little. Makes me feel like I'm not worthy to hear about her. Or it makes me feel like she thinks I don't care.  I understand that if my sister is in the room or if something else is going on, I'll be distracted....but the same has happened to me, and I wasn't upset by it. It didn't make me feel like she didn't care, it just made me aware that she was busy. So I waited out the convo between her and her sister to say good bye. It works, and I understand.  I just want to feel like I matter sometimes. And I know, I feel it all the time when we are together. But we do spend a lot of time on the phone, and it feels like I'm yakkin, and unworthy. I hate hearing my voice, especially when I'm not saying anything with meaning. I know silence has meaning, but why have silence you are paying for?  I know I've been mean....but it isn't mean spirits...just joking, cute joking. I'm sorry if I've offended you, and I'm sorry I ditched you the other day.  This isn't any attack, or hate, or anger, or anything. Its just me needing to get something off my chest. I don't feel like talking about it because alas...I don't feel like we would get anywhere.   I love you with all my heart (as I've probably said before) Please acknowledge that I have an open ear, and would like to use it. I'll listen to anything, just the way you do.   I know it seems rediculous to be ranting about phone conversations, but after almost 8 months, it feels like I've done the majority of the talking, and I wasn't saying anything.  All my love. ~Elan  P.S comment, respond, please. I need some form of knowing I didn't offend you. or if I did, I'm sorry, but this needed to come out here, not on the phone. ~~Elan

      Today was so unfortunate, that it was hilarious. It all starts with: Chem-Had an in class assignment to do. I lost a key part and had to do almost twice as much work. Math-TEST French- Hoang assigned a huge amount of homework last night, and today didn't even give a shit....so I had to convince her to mark it down for points. History-Returned our books, no one was there, so I had to wait 5-10 minutes into lunch to return the book LUNCH- Rehearsal. We rehearsed The Brig English- Blatz calls monet's group (I'm in it) and we had to do our play, WITHOUT ONE REHEARSAL!  After school: French Homework begins. Dan calls, asks me to hang out with him by the south gym, to wait for spencer. I arrive, and cannot fit through the gate (b/c of my large chest :-P) and have to climb the fence. As I had my skateboard, I was trying little tricks. Just little tricks. and then, I decided to try a big-ish trick. WHAM fall....hit my head on concrete bench and land in a puddle. So now: My back, pants, shirt, boxers, wallet, and ass are all wet. I talk to dan about why he's waiting, he realises that it wasn't a good idea, and we leave. Dan takes the #2 bus, and I skate off. I'm going pretty fast, and all of a sudden  WHAM wheels stop moving, I flip off my board, land on my head, roll on to my shoulder, arm, and wrist. I also rolled my right ankle pretty bad, and hurt my left wrist.  So now I'm home, and have a shitload of homework to do. NONE of which I can start before going to Michaels art supply. I had to go to michaels to buy little styrofoam balls. I arrive at michaels, go to the styrofoam balls section, and find the sizes I need. I needed 14 big ones and 6 little ones. THEY ONLY COME IN PACKS OF 12 so now I had to buy twice as many little ones as I needed, and almost twice as many big balls as I needed. I was running late b/c of the line at michaels.  My ankle is rolled, so it hurts when I'm running to the car. Dad is waiting for me, we go home. I start work immediatley. I had to make 10 corrections to essays from English. I only found 8. because one essay I never got back. So I had to write a long confusing note. THEN I had to do another english assignment. Which I thought was a photoshopped thinger. I almost finished the thinger, when my friend Jenny notified me that "you have to compare it to something else" and I said FUCK IT!  How about all that happening in one day. funny shit.  ~Elan. p.s comments I DARE YOU! please?

      Well, school is back, for the real last stretch. Chem-We had rags as a sub, so it was bad. But arts and crafts are god :-P Math-Last section was today! Test on thursday, then review for final!! French-rhymes with wench, such as madame hoang. but seriously, folks. :-D History-Last homework assignment of the year was just handed out! Its really the end!!! Lunch-Rehearsal for Joey's play. English-Joey's play took a very very long time to complete.  I'm signed up for 3 more plays, I think. So its gonna be a lot of fun. Much love to the friends, and much love to Kaya. ~Elan P.S Comments? I need a molecule.  Tell me some compund that is involved with our everyday lives.  A complex one. It can be a medicine or something. I just neeeed a thinger. Also...essay for english, AND A FINAL IN CLASS!!! WTF! Mr blatz is a psycho. A really awesome psycho.

      in the words that sum up everything I wanted to say: "How could such a happy day have such a sad ending." HOW?    Everything I had, and loved. All gone....and its all my fault. My organs feel like they are being chewed to bits, and no one can hear my screams. I had a flowering relationship, with the best girl I've ever dated....I was a lucky man, but I ruined it all.... I deserved it. I've never felt this way before.....I'm actually tearing.... I love her so much. DO YOU HEAR ME???? WORLD?????? I LOVE KAYA BEERY!!!!! But....the last I love you I got felt so empty, and hollow....After yesterday I know what it means...I guess it didn't sink in. I feel cold and alone....I have afrog in my whole body, not just in my throat...and its plugging me up entirely.  That was my bit of poetry I guess. Thats how I felt when she said it. It felt like a huge box fell on me....and its infinetly heavy....I won't be able to lift it.   I know it might be a "just a six week thing," but I'm screaming inside.....because when I said to her "I look into your eyes and I see you saying 'I'm sick and tired of this'"  of course she was. WHO WOULDN"T BE????????? I got what I deserved... I feel like I'm falling....my hands are shakijng now....and I can't type very welll.... I love her with all my  heart and soul.  ~Elan B Samuel

      everything I have said, and written in this blog, has offended someone at some point or another. So I'll just stop. I love blogging, but I can only seem to be extremely negative when I do it. So I'm stopping. I love ya'll, but I felt totally alienated last night. and it doesn't help when I can't seem to stop offending my girlfriend. I love you Kaya, and I'm sorry for everything I've said and done. Please forgive me. No more beating around the bush. From now on, all that I complain about here, will go out in the open, when neccesary. But most of it wasn't neccesary, so don't think I'm going to be constantly complaining. Again, I love you kaya....please forgive me. ~Elan

      (this is how I remember it) I asked earlier today if Kaya wanted to see me tomorrow, and she said, "sure, but I'm busy in the morning and afternoon" And I asked her again tonight if she wanted to, and the response was "I can't." So..I came to the conclusion that, because I'm an assmonger, I am not gonna be on good terms with her....which is entirely my fault...and I have no way to change it.....because I am (see one line up,) an assmonger. See ya'll when you actually want to see me ~Asshole guy whose name doesn't matter anymore.

      Okay, FINE! I'm a jerk, sweet. I feel totally happy, because ___ is a hypocrite who is totally blind to the world around them. And because with all the fucking annoyances caused, I have the right to blow up. You don't fucking nagg yer mom while she's fuckin driving, so why the FUCK would you nagg me, while I schlep you everywhere, and yeah. Kaya, I love you, and I'm sorry for what I said last entry, I know it enraged you, and, I guess it seems wrong. I can't explain my logic with that, and I can't use more friendly diction, but I could tell you weren't happy with me, and I think it was that, and the fact that I'm an ass. No point in denying it, as its been verified my numerous sources....namely my best friends and girlfriend. So thank you, and I'll keep you in mind as I wonder what the world would be like if I wasn't in it at all for a week. I dunno. I'm just sad. I have a problem right now. I wanna be alone.... but I don't. I want to see Kaya. She's leaving on monday...for a long long time. I hope she doesn't come back and realize how bad I've been, and that she wants to leave me...that could easily shatter me. I duuno, I have been a jerk, with no worthwhile excuse, but I need some time off.  I'm gonna spend some time alone after Kaya leaves, and see how that goes. This was probably the most incoherent string of sentences, but I am not thinking about what I wrote earlier. I'm just typing what comes out of my head. I am really fucking annoyed, thats all. I love you Kaya, with all that I have. I hope you can forgive and understand, even though I have no reason. I just felt like banging my head on something when you left....and I did. It got a lot out. Maybe I should do it more often....... I'm sad. All my love ~Elan p.s. vent vent vent.

      Why in the fuck can't I find anyone that agrees with me? I dunno. I'm fucking mad. I'll get over it. But I know in my heart that what I'm doing is right....so FUCK! Who cares if people think I'm wrong....this is the way I do things....and fuck it. I'm not fucking prince charming. So why should I fucking pretend to be? I should NOT have any fucking expectations to live up to. I know it sounds selfish....but after a year of asshole parents and their expectations...why can't I just be me, and not have people breathing down my fucking neck? I know....I'm most likely exaggerating reality....but thats how it FUCKING feels.   O-FUCKING-KAY I know.......David has to go......but I don't think its my job to fucking kick him out. Who knows? even if I do say something, how in the FUCK does anyone know he'll listen? FOR ALL I KNOW HE FUCKING WON'T DO ANYTHING!!!! it isn't my place... I wasn't there during their relationship, and I have no voice, except that of Kaya's new, caring boyfriend. She has to do this.....I know in my fucking heart that she HAS to do this. I can't "protect" her. Why does she need protection??? she OBVIOUSLY showed loyalty....in not cheating on me then and there.....which obviously means she cares MORE about me than him....because SHE DIDN"T CHEAT ON ME WITH HER EX BOYFRIEND....who seems to relentlessy torture her. She needs to do this...because it is a lesson she needs to learn. It isn't me teaching it....I just want to encourage her to do this. She should do this because, what if, in the future, she has to deal with a manipulator, and doesn't have elan to stand up for her? (hypothetical situation) I"m not scared of doing it. I just don't want this opportunity to be missed. If, however, she can't do it, for ANY reason, I will do what I'm "supposed" to do, and simply tell him, in any means that Kaya wants to be bothered no more, and that I'm the boyfriend now...so he should leave her alone. He might still be attached to her....but thats pretty fucking selfish of him, to come with apologies and tears, expecting something in fucking return. If something else happened, that you didn't tell me about (Kaya.) tell me. Tell me. tell me. I'm here to listen ~Elan P.s. comments...however, this was NOT, and I repeat, NOT an attack on anyone. It was just me venting. Its true...I'll do it if she doesn't...but I think she should. all my love to all my friends, and I don't hate ya'all

      Its because I just don't feel like sitting and typing....I dunno. I do like writing entries, though....it takes a load off....so I guess here I go with another. Ah.... This week was interesting....Dan slept over 3 nights in a row, or something like that...and by the end I was annoyed. Its okay though....he and joe went away for the weekend and I'm sure that when they get back all will be forgotten. SO I was finally able to see Kaya!!!!!! REJOICE!!! BE MERRY!!!!! 4 days in a row we hung out. We did many things, we went to the beach, we watched queer as folk, we slept, and stuff! It was really nice to be with her...but today we took the day off from each other. She's leaving again soon.....but for Japan.....and for a much longer time. I'm nervous..... I got a strange feeling that when she comes back, she won't be interested anymore... I hope that doesn't happen....but, frankly, who the hell even knows what could happen?  I saw the picture of the girl she is staying with...it will be a lot of fun for her. GO READ  urlLink GIRLY  part one just concluded...and it made me sooo happy *sniff sniff* Seriously.....the awesomeness. I don't remember much else..... ~Elan P.s. COMMMMMENNNNTTTTt
