      There are those places whom are unimportant, but this place, where sea and fresh water meet, -------Is important----- Where the hawks sway out into the wind; without a single windbeat, And the eagles sail low over th fir trees; in the curved harbors, And the tide rises us against the grass; nibbled by sheep and rabbits

      The fountains mingle with the rivers, and the rivers with the ocean; The winds of Heaven mix forever, with a sweet emotion; Nothing in the world is single: all things by law divine See! THe mountains kiss high Heaven, And the waves clasp one another; And the sunlight clasps the Earth, What are these kissings worth, If thou kiss not me?

      There is no happier life; THe comforts are so sweet when two do meet. 'Tis plenty a calm like dropping balm; Love's weather is so fair, Like perfumed air, Each word such pleasure brings, like soft-touch strings; Love's passion moves the heart on either part; Such harmony together, So pleased in either. Sealed with one will. With love God made man one, yet not alone. Like stamps of Kings and Queens, it may be seen: two figures on one coin, so they do join, only they not embrace.

      Hold fast to  dreams  For if  dreams  die Life is a broken-winged bird That cannot fly.  Hold fast to  dreams , For when  dreams  go, Life is a barren field, Frozen with snow.

      There is no one more precious than the one you love, To sense you're walking on air in the clouds above. To know there is no one more perfect, no one more wise, Because you see the universe when you look in their eyes. No one could possibly take their place, When you know every curve of their fabulous face, Their kiss can give you the greatest high, Like soaring on wings, through the heavens you'll fly. Their gentle caress is softer than silk, Their comforting words like mother's milk. You could lie in their arms for the rest of your life, Safe from your troubles, forgetting your strife Your heart starts to race with each affectionate glance You know love's a gamble but it's worth the chance. Without them your life would cease to matter, Your soul would drain and your heart would shatter. You wish time would stop whenever they're near, So one small second could seem like a year There's something about them you just can't explain, A special hidden trait that just drives you insane You would rather imagine wanting to die, Than to ever think of saying goodbye They showed you a love that you never knew, Deep in your heart you know they'll be true Yet, what's best of all is they make you whole. For you've found the one to complete your soul.

       Love  is like a rose That blooms in the spring  Love  is like an April Shower, watering a beautiful flower.  Love  is like a cold  Winter day sitting by a fire.  Love  is like a warm Spring day if you have someone to admire.  Love  is something I'd only share with you  Love  is something special and true When I think of  love , I think of me and you!

      I wish I could tell you how much I really care for you, but what I've realized over these past weeks, is that its not possible for me to put into words how much I really do care and I wish I could help you realize how great we could have it. It was so perfect before, or atleast we thought, but we could have it even more perfect now. There's so much that I just can't let go of even though I'v tried. It's hard to explain and I guess you'll never really understand unless you can really look deep down inside your heart and try to remember what we used to have. I felt something with you, something I've never felt before and as hard as I may try it just wont go away. Lying there in your arms for hours on end doing nothing, it was special, it meant the most. I miss that, I miss you, and I'll always be here. I believe everyone deserves a second chance, just maybe I could have mine?

      "Your words are my food, your breath is my wine You are everything to me."  "I love you not only for what you are, but for what I am when I am with you"  "As we grow older together, As we continue to change with age, There is one thing that will never change... I will always keep falling in love with you."  "For, you see, each day I love you more, Today more than yesterday and less than tomorrow."  "Love is the greatest feeling, Love is like a play, Love is what I feel for you, Each and every day, Love is like a smile, Love is like a song, Love is a great emotion, That keeps us going strong, I love you with my heart, My body and my soul, I love the way I keep loving, Like a love I can't control, So remember when your eyes meet mine, I love you with all my heart, And I have poured my entire soul into you, Right from the very start."  "All the love that history knows, is said to be in every rose. Yet all that could be found in two, is less than what I feel for you."   ARE ALL THING I WOULD'VE SAID TO YOU!

      First, I crash my go-cart; its friggin totaled! Then, Linds don't talk to me anymore. Outta the blue she calls me; I think things are good again, Till she says we're thru. Man it burns! Then i fail my algebra, sciance, and history finals. And my uncle dies.  Then my favorites president dies: Ronald Reagan. And my favorite blues singer dies: Ray Charles. Who else is gonna die? Everyone's dieing. I guess its the in thing to do: Just die! Where is my life taking me, thru heartbreak and pain. What else is there, nothin'. A person with no future. A rich fool!

      I feel like I did somethin' that was so wrong, but I know I didn't. I feel like my life is fallin' apart at the seams. Like I'm runnin' and there's no place to run to. Like theres no reason to live. I'm outta wind, I jus wanna roll ova and die. Linds jus dumped me for no reason. "THis isn't working out, Ray I love you; but at the same time I don't, I'm jus confused right now" "Let it burn"[click]
