      Looking at so many of the expensive yarns out there, I was thinking what a shame it is that the garments go out somewhere without anybody ever again making use from them.  Having that (and actually a few nice yarns I wanted to have, but thought were too expensive to buy) in mind, I went to a thrift store and had a look to see what I could do.  A little while ago I had found borders to be sewn in, that consisted of a small stripe of fabric to which a fringe of beads in several shades of purple had been attached. They were on sale, so I got them for a cheap price. Already when I bought them, I thought they would be great embellishments for knitted pillow covers. In the thrift store I found 3 sweaters that where made from materials that looked right. One was a purple sweater, knitted, made from Chenille. The other one was a black sweater, made from Acrylic in some chenille type fashion (to be quite honest I don't really know what makes chenille chenille, the acrylic yarn was a boucle type yarn, may be that's it). And the third sweater is actually the nicest. It's made from a boucle yarn that is a mix of 75 % Acrylic and 25% Wool. It has a really interesting feel to it, the color is the green of moss shortly before it blooms, with some darker and some lighter accents in it. It will correspond nice with the purple, even though I think, they shouldn't touch directly, that might be the wrong combination, but I do have the black. My intention is to make pillows that have a V type pattern, at the outside the purple then an appropriate thick line of black and then the green at the inside. Worked in plain stockinette stitch, intarsia technique.  I will have to swatch to see how much yarn I need, my idea is, that I should get 4 pillows out of three sweaters which I urchased each for $5. So far I have ripped apart the purple and black sweater. My losses of yarn weren't too great. I made sure that I bought good quality sweaters (brand/designer names seem indeed to stand for better quality), so that I could find the yarn ends easily. The black sweater was a V-neck with raglan arms, there I had the problem that the sides of the front V were lined with some type of sewing thread that I couldn't separate from the actual yarn I wanted to re-use, so I had to cut those front pieces from the left and right side of the V-Neck out and lost some yarn there. While ripping the yarn out, I wound it on skeins, using two sturdy pieces of cardboard to wrap it around. It's a rather dirty work. Lots of dust and little fiber particles are coming loose. It seems the thrift store I got these sweaters from doesn't wash them before they re-sell. They were also rather smelly, dusty and some remnants of perfume/fabric softener could be smelled. I washed these skeins by hand using suave shampoo. It took care of the smell and eliminated all remaining dust. Then I hung them on wood dowels over my bath tub to try. It takes about 48 hours for such a skein to try. This evening I might get started on ripping out the green sweater. Even though it's rather dirty work to do, there is some satisfaction in knowing, that I can make something pretty I eally like out of something that otherwise was thrown away.  I'm often thinking that we throw away too much in general. Everything has to be new and shiny, all the time to be replaced to be in the new fashion, to be of the new style, never giving anything any value beyond it's momentary appearance status. This applies to things. But when does it end? Are we really only applying it to things? How soon until we think about throw-away people throw-away animals? Old people, neglected and lonely in a care facility? Dogs tied out on the freeway when there owner wants to go on a vacation trip?  I think, we need to reconsider our general attitude as a society. And a hobby like knitting, that uses great skill in creating a garment should actual give us to think and teach us to value more then only fashion or style.  Pia

      Another project that I have on my needles right now is the current knit along of the  urlLink Ample Knitter's list   which is the  Cable Tee based on a design from Maureen Taylor.  If you follow the link "group projects" on the webpage it gets you to a picture of the Tee. I really like the way this T-Shirt looks, it seems to be comfy, airy yet still a bit dressy and sure made to be worn with a more ample figure (sigh), too.  I use a Cotton/Acrylic mix the Filatura Lanarota Luxor DK, which I bought a Smileys Yarns, one of my favorite  internet yarn vendors.  urlLink  . The Tee comes along quite nice. It needs easy because most of it is stockinette stitch and it is my preferred take along knitting at the moment.  Pia

      When knitting some baby outfits for friends, I found a real nice stitch and thought it would look nice for a triangular shawl. The stitch is a simple lacy pattern that goes over 4 rows. It needs a number of stitches that can be divided by 3. Row 1    sl1 p1 *k2tog yo p1* k1 Row 2    sl1 k1 *p2 k1* k1 Row 3    sl1 p1 *yo sl1 k1 psso p1* k1 Row 4    sl1 k1 *p2 k1* k1 Repeat from * to * as many times as needed: (number of cast on stitches /3)-1 times  The stitch creates a fabric that is slightly 3-dimensional with a zig-zag knit stitch elevated.  When designing the shawl I thought, that an increase of 1 stitch per row would give me the right proportion of lenght/shoulder width. I did the increases every other row on the left and right side of the center stitch. That way it looked as if new pattern repeats were growing out of the center stitch, which was very much what I liked. But it were too many increases, the shawl didn't look like a triangle but like a kite. I tried to correct that with short rows at the top after I had reached the length I wanted doing the increases no longer at the middle stitch but at either end of the shawl, but that didn't look good either. The short rows created disturbances in the pattern that became visible and the sides of the shawl that were to be folded over the shoulders looked stretched and just not right. At this point I had worked already 4 - 5 weeks on the shawl.  I had used some really nice wool in sport weight from   urlLink Bartlett's yarns   and I did not want to let the yarn go to waste on an at best mediocre project, so I ripped it all out and wound it loosely on balls.  I started the shawl over, increasing 2 stitches every 4 th row. The shawl again starts to get a kite-like look after I reached the 30th row and I try to adjust by doing 2 increases every 6th row. If that doesn't help, I will try to change the position of the increases, doing every other increase at the side ends of the shawl, may be that will take care of the problem.  All ideas on how to solve the weird shaping would be greatly appreciated! I do not want to block the shawl to strongly because I don't want to ruin the pretty stretchiness of the pattern.  -----------------------------------------------  I posted the same question on the  urlLink Knitter's review forum . Just check in if you want to follow the discussion there.

      I liked the Blogs I saw once in a while and thought it would be nice to have one of my own. Finally I decided to get started and set one up on my own. I actually intend to have pictures of my knitting, finished and in progress up here and may be let it become an incentive to finish some  U (n-)  F (inished)  O (bject)'s.  Come and check in to see what's going on.   Pia
