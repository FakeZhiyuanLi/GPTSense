      We washed my car today. I have been a little apprehensive about doing it lately, because it has actually been raining here, and we SO totally need it! So, after putting it off for about a week, I decided to bite the bullet and take my chance. If it does rain, it's all good...it was clean for a little while.  Well, I say  we ... It was actually me doing the actual washing while Abbie ran through the water. The hose had a small hole in it, and I turned the hose so it would spray into the air. She  loved  it. And it didn't take quite as long to get the job done...no offense. I love her, but sometimes...  You all know what I mean.  We also made cookies today. The slice-and-bake kind. But, I have decided I don't like them because they're supposed to be sugar cookies and they taste like lemon.   Hello!   I think next time we will try to take the long way around (The circuitous route! Heh...shout out to you in Old Blue!) I mean try to make them from scratch. We'll see if it happens. I will probably give in and take the easy way out.  Now, I am ready for bed. I had a tiring day, even though I was able to take a nap! And, Abbie's nap was almost 3 hours long. Yay!  Oh, we are so excited that my little, big sis and niece will be visiting us next week. It will be a short and sweet visit, but, hey, it counts. For those of you who are interested... urlLink Coleygirl ! And for those of you who aren't, take F*ck-it-all. (Shout out to you-know-who...hehe!)  Oh, BTW, my tattoo is gone. :.( I guess I wash my hands too much. I don't know, though, if that is a bad thing. :)

      So, I want to know who the wise guy is in the federal government that changed all the guidelines for FAFSA???   As you can tell, I am in school,  obviously , and it used to be that you can fill out your FAFSA beginning January 1 for the next school year.&nbsp; Well, now, you can't fill it out intil July 1!   So, me being the big anal-retentive nerd that I am, I logged on the morning of July 1 and filled it out.&nbsp; But, now it's screwing up my application for a loan from the bank.&nbsp; It turns out that I can't apply for a loan from Wells Fargo until I know how much moola I'm getting from the school.&nbsp; (There's&nbsp;some cap on how much&nbsp;money you can borrow for college.)&nbsp; So, I'm waiting and  waiting  and  waiting  to receive the award letter from the school.  But that screws me up in the job department because I need to quit soon if I am going to not work there next semester.&nbsp; BUT, I can't quit until I know if I am going to get the money from the bank!&nbsp; Would SOMEONE please let those puffy-suits in Washington, DC know that they're seriously messing things up for us students???

      Heh, I just realized that I never said how Friday's excursion went.  Well, we met at McD's so the kiddos could eat lunch and play together for a while, and then drove to the zoo.&nbsp; Unfortunately, by the time we got there, it would only be about an hour before the zoo would close, so, after much deliberation,&nbsp;we decided to go to Putt-Putt&nbsp;instead.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was so fun!  We did the arcade game thing,&nbsp;bumper boat thing and the racecar thing, and believe me, with 4 kids and 2 adults, it got  kinda  crazy.&nbsp; We were getting pretty creative in trying to coordinate things.&nbsp; But, I'm pretty sure everyone had a fun time.  After that, it was off to CiCi's to feed the young'uns.&nbsp; (Us, too, but that's a given!)&nbsp; The kiddos had fun speding their quarters and tokens both places, even though they were pretty heart-broken about not being able to go to the zoo.&nbsp; We'll go again, sometime.&nbsp; You'll see.

      thump.&nbsp; thump thump thump.   What's that sound???   THUMP&nbsp;&nbsp;  THUMP A.    That's Gigi's car! &nbsp;&nbsp;Haha.&nbsp; My friend came over today and rewired my sound system in my car (thanks,&nbsp;man!) &nbsp;because it wasn't working correctly.&nbsp; No, I did not blow a speaker (darn!), but I had problems in the, uh, wiring, DUH!&nbsp; So, now you can hear my car from  way  far away.&nbsp; Even farther than when I first had it put in.&nbsp; I'll let you know the count on car alarms that I set off...HEHEHE!&nbsp; (I'm not a bad person...my own car alarm is very sensitive and goes off when people drive by with their systems blaring, sometimes.)   ...Random question alert!   Have you ever realized how nice it feels to just wash your feet?&nbsp; I had taken a shower before I made my last post, but when my friend was working on my car, I was outside without shoes on, and my feet got all dusty and dry.&nbsp; So, when I came back in, I just washed my feet in the shower, and it felt   SO   nice.&nbsp; And, I'm still tired--as opposed to when I take a full-fledged shower late in the day and it wakes me up and makes it so I don't want to go to bed at night.   AbbieDabbie had NO problem going to sleep tonight.&nbsp; AWWR!&nbsp; I guess with everything we did this weekend, she was still tired...who'd've thunk?&nbsp; Tired, after being at the lake for a day and a half, and without any naps...hmmph!&nbsp; I better get in bed, too.&nbsp; We've got a big day planned for tomorrow!&nbsp; G'night!

      Here she is learning to cast.   urlLink      Well, the lake was really cool.&nbsp; Even though we got a lot of sun, we enjoyed fishing and swimming.&nbsp; The weather was alright.&nbsp; It was overcast most of the day Saturday, and at least until we left on Sunday.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp;I didn't see the sun until I went out to get the mail a few minutes ago.&nbsp; It was very windy last night, so no one got much sleep, except for AbbieDabbie who slept right through most of it.&nbsp; And, we lost one of our tents to the lake.&nbsp; It was empty because it was the tent that we had brought for Abbie to play in, so she could be out of the sun.&nbsp; Abbie was heart-broken&nbsp;about losing her tent, and cried for a while, but she is now over it.   She truly enjoyed fishing.&nbsp; She had never done it, and we had to teach her everything.&nbsp; It was so cool.&nbsp; She didn't have the patience to wait for a fish to bite, but we let her run around for a while and leave her pole on a rock.&nbsp; She really enjoyed it.&nbsp; Man, I don't think I have ever seen her so happy before.&nbsp; And that made the  whole  trip worthwhile.

      See my new tattoo???  urlLink     Yeah, so it's only a Henna tattoo, so it'll be gone in about 2 weeks or so, but it will be&nbsp;fun while it lasts.&nbsp;&nbsp;They've been&nbsp;doing special things at work for the kiddos, and today it was henna tattoos.&nbsp; Cool beans.&nbsp; Two ladies that I work with got their own tattos, so I decided to go ahead and do it.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; I like the way it looks on my hand, so if I ever get an inkling to get a real tattoo of my own...  Right...!  Not much has happened the last few days...just that we are getting ready to go to the lake this weekend, and I am so excited.&nbsp; Abbie's excited, too, because we keep telling her everything we will get to do, like fishing and swimming.&nbsp; YAY!&nbsp; (She's never been to the lake.)  OH, YEAH...we got  DirecTV  with  TiVo !&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; So, lately, we have mostly been sitting around watching all our new TV channels, and that's why I haven't been writing.&nbsp; (Not exactly, but, hey, it's an excuse!)

      AbbieDabbie is going to Vacation Bible School at a church near our house this week.&nbsp; So far, she is enjoying it, and it has been a good thing for my moma, who has been taking care of her for me while I work this summer.&nbsp; (thanks!)&nbsp; It turns out that Mom has to go back to school 3 days earlier than we had thought, so with Little Bit gone, she is able to do some work she needs to do before she goes back to school.  But, I think this school is good for her.&nbsp; She gets to be with other kids and play (and get tired) for a while each day.&nbsp; She has been taking  really  good naps.&nbsp; Next week, though,&nbsp;she's going to get antsy being at home everyday, but hopefully I can think of things to keep her busy in the afternoons after I get home from school.  We are going to try to go to the zoo Friday.&nbsp; Hopefully it will work out, as long as she's not too tired after being at the bible school all morning.&nbsp; If she is, hey, it's a fact of life that people get tired, but we'll see.&nbsp; I am needing to get out and break the monotony of going to work and then going straight home and staying there every day.  We also are going to the lake this weekend.&nbsp; WAHOO!&nbsp; So nice.&nbsp; Abbie has never been there, and so I am excited because I remember how fun it was when I was a kid.&nbsp; The water level is very low, so it won't be quite the same, but I still think she will like it.

      So, today I went to see  urlLink Spidey 2 !&nbsp; It was cool. &nbsp; Although some of it was unrealistic (destroying a fusion reaction of that magnitude by just throwing it into a river??? I mean, come on...), I truly enjoyed seeing it...&nbsp; Even though I still haven't seen part 1...:)&nbsp; Yet another time I saw part 2 before part 1...am I making this a trend? (And for those of you who are interested, I&nbsp;saw  urlLink Two Towers  before The Fellowship of The Ring...&nbsp; Oh, and I saw parts 1 and 3 of  urlLink Harry Potter , but have yet to see part 2.&nbsp; Hehe) &nbsp; I would like to see  urlLink I, Robot ...heh, yeah...only because of Will Smith.&nbsp; I have heard mixed reviews, but I heard someone say today that it was better than Spidey!&nbsp; I have to check it out.&nbsp; (I did see  urlLink Wild Wild West  in the theater...the cheesiest movie he has been in, but I am a FAN, man!)&nbsp;  And  I decided I would be interested in seeing  urlLink Catwoman .&nbsp; Yeah, I wasn't sure of it at first, because I thought it would be dumb, but the preview before Spidey told more of the story behind her cat-woman-ness, and I thought it sounded interesting. &nbsp; Still can't wait to see The Incredibles... Someone  got me hooked on Pixar with his wild ambitions...crazy boys!&nbsp; But, that's not until November...darn...so much is still to happen before then.&nbsp; Oh, well.&nbsp; By the time it does come out, maybe I'll need a break from school. &nbsp; Speaking of looking forward to things,  urlLink Nickelback  and  urlLink Puddle of Mudd  are having a concert the day school starts, and I am so STOKED!&nbsp; Cool cat.&nbsp; Ok, that's the end of my commercial for now.&nbsp; It's time to put my soap-box away and get in bed.&nbsp; Let me know what you are waiting for...you know, movie-wise.

      So, yesterday was a busy day.  &nbsp;  Abbie and I went to lunch with friends so the kids could play together, but that was after I had taken her to a park.&nbsp; Then, we came home and after I was able to (finally) clean my bathroom, we went swimming at my uncle's house.&nbsp;  And then , I had a wedding reception to go to, so Granny and GrandDaddy kept AbbieDabbie with them at the uncle's house so I could have fun with my co-workers.&nbsp; (Thanks!)&nbsp; It was fun, but tiring. &nbsp; I'll tell you, Abbie slept until 8 this morning, which is not normal.&nbsp; Considering that she did not get in bed until almost 11:30, one would think it is to be expected, but, oh, no!&nbsp; Not from AbbieDabbie.&nbsp; She usually wakes up between 7 &amp; 7:30 as usual, even when she goes to bed late.&nbsp; (Now, if it has been a few days in a row of going to bed late but still getting up at regular time, that's a different story.&nbsp; Sometimes she'll sleep until 9:30 or so when that's the case.)  &nbsp;  So, this morning&nbsp;we're sittin' in Granny and GrandDaddy's room, and she's trying to get the adults to add to her collection of things she has in a plastic bag.&nbsp; When I tell her that I don't have anything unless she'll accept pretend stuff, she informs me that it's ok and shows me what GrandDaddy has added, two bookmarks, to her collection.&nbsp; Then she says, and I quote, "Actually, he offered me a magazine, but it wouldn't fit, so I asked for something else."!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; Can you believe it?&nbsp; Out of a 4 year-old's mouth!&nbsp; I was  shocked .  &nbsp;  Well, that was a lot of this-is-this and that-is-that, but I felt it was important to note that she is using adult vocabulary and sentence structure at 4 years, three months&nbsp;and one week of age (to be exact).&nbsp; So, did she learn it from living with 3 grown-ups and no kiddos her whole life?&nbsp; I would think so.

      Pitiful, isn't she?&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    &nbsp; So, we went to the doctor today!&nbsp; No problems, nothing.&nbsp; And she's 43 and&nbsp;1/2 inches tall...that's pretty long for a 4 year old.&nbsp; Vision and audio tests went ok...the audio test did give us problems, but the Dr.&nbsp;said it was common with kiddos that have tubes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Three shots and one TB test, so she was pretty tired after all that crying, and slept for almost 3 hours, and that was only because I woke her up.&nbsp; :)

      Well, I haven't had a very eventful life these last few days, so there really hasn't really been much to write about.  Hence some non-posting days.  We went swimming yesterday, and she had so much fun!  We have some unexpected visitors in town (technically, they're not our visitors because they're not at our house, but they're our family, so that counts) and we were invited to join them at my uncle's house last night.  We were there late, as usual, and I had to get up this morning to take AbbieDabbie to the dentist.  I did alright with having to get up, but she didn't.  It took a while to get her to wake up and stop trying to lay down and go back to sleep.  Nothing super-eventful happened while we were swimming...only that Abbie lost an earplug, so we had to get her out of the water and then try to look for it.  It wasn't found last night, but I think they were going to look this morning.  I'd hate for it to gum up the pump and stuff...That would be the worst.  Dentist today went well, no cavities or anything.  Don't need to go back for 6 months, so we're good to go.  She has a doctor's appointment Friday, so I will let you know how that goes.

      With my 4.0, you would think I would have gotten something!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     My first semester at a  urlLink full blown university  and I'm already making a name for myself!  (Funny thing is...almost none of my classes are in that building next semester...and it's not because I'm not taking engineering classes!)

      Let me tell ya about what came out of my mouth earlier when Abbie was in the bathtub...   "I'm dabba-dabba-ing, so stay still!"   Wouldn't my future employer enjoy hearing me talk like that!  And you only thought I was kidding about losing my vocabulary in that paragraph above.  Oh, ye Doubting Thomas!  To combat my loss of vocab, I have been taking part in the daily crossword(s) at work.  There are 5 or 6 of us who take part, and it has been fun learning the many ways they try to trick you in those hints.  "You gotta be quick with me...I'm from Eerie, P.A.!"  Some rather bothering news:   urlLink Here  is a story about part of my family...it is just not right.  I'm not going to even begin to say how much certain things in that news clip upset me...only to say this:  Abbie will NOT be attending Mitzi Bond elementary, and that Texas has lost out on one extraordinary former future teacher.  (I was planning on being an engineer for a while, and then as Abbie grew, I was going to become a teacher so I could be there for her when she needed me.  Well, not no mo'e!)  That's that!

      Signature&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Just so we can say I knew you when...  On June 26, 2004, her signature was left on artwork...all over it, actually.  I think she was practicing, because she wrote her name  at least  4 times on this one piece of paper.  So exciting.  (Yes, it is going in her baby book...:))  I was watching "Never Been Kissed" again, this afternoon, and realized just how good looking those two guys are...Michael Vartan (go  urlLink Alias   ABC Sundays 9/8c ), and Jeremy Jordan.  Who'd've thunk...good looking guys appearing in movies...now THAT's a first.  But seriously...  They're really cute.  Right now, GrandDaddy is singing to Abbie.  I can hear it all the way in my room...and believe me, since they've added on to our house, its a long way!  So cute.  Well, wish me luck...Abbie took a late nap today, even though it was only...2 hours long (I told you.)  I am going to try to keep her entertained and make her tired enough to go to sleep.  Bathtime ought to be interesting.

      Well, in response to the question...yes!  She did go to bed, and at 8:30, no less.  I just think she still is trying to make up for her loss of sleep last weekend.  But, she is not taking a nap today, so maybe that's the end of that!  Today at work was not too bad.  Very slow, but we did have a few people come in, which is better than the last few days at work when NO ONE has come in.  No plans, yet, for this afternoon with Abbie, but we'll think of something.

      Catch the water!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Well, Abbie eventually woke up...after sleeping for  3 and 1/2 hours!   That kind of thing doesn't happen very often.  When she is on her schedule, she usually sleeps for EXACTLY 2 hours then gets up, thanks to DayCare.  But, when she is not on schedule, she usually doesn't take a nap...bummah.  Well, it was already 5 when she got up, and I needed to find something that would make her tired enough to go to bed at 8:30, (Yeah, right...but we'll see.) so, obviously, we went outside and washed my car.  It has needed a bath for a few days, because I parked in our new driveway under the Mexican Elder tree...yeah...not a good idea at all.  I walked out in the morning, and my car was  covered  with  purple berries .  ARGH!  So, I sprayed it off, but haven't had time to wash it until now, and I think there are still some berries left on there, even though I put TONS of elbow grease into it.  Sux!  So, I'll keep you posted on how tonight goes, because I am *supposed* to get in bed at 9 to go to work in the morning.  We'll see.

      So, today was the first day of my new schedule at work, and it was great!  Even though I did have to hit my snooze button this morning, I was glad to have gotten up early and not slept the morning away.  (I have been sleeping until 8:30 or so, and by the time I would eat breakfast, and get myself and Abbie ready for the day, it would be practically lunchtime.  Now I will be AT work at 7, so that will be nice.)  My morning was so nice...and if you've been reading  urlLink my sister's blog  (or even know me iRL), you know I am a person who dances in my car.  Hardcore.  This morning I was jamming out, and I realized I hadn't done it in a LONG time.  You know the kind where you don't care who is staring open mouthed...not even enough to tell them to take a picture because it lasts longer.  I couldn't remember when I had last gotten lost in my music like that, so it had to be before last semester got hectic and stressful.  FOREVER AGO!  (Oh, and just in case you're wondering (and I know you are!!!), it was to Lifehouse, Hanging by a Moment.)  So, I am now home from work.  I got out early and went to lunch with my Uncle and his new wife, but I'm so ready to wake Abbie up so we can get outside and wash the car.  Sadly, I think I will just let her sleep and wait to wash the car.  (It's kinda like, "Can Abbie come out and play??"  :))  *Well, I actually write this post at 2:30 or so, but it published twice, so, to make a long story short, I had to delete both entries and could not delete just one.

      Fun in the pool with GrandDaddy!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Can't you just see the beauty in that picture???  I love it...And GrandDaddy looks good, too...hehe.  Well, it is not often that we can go swimming, since AbbieDabbie has tubes in her ears, and she had SO much fun today.  We went to my uncle's house and there were lots of people there, and some were even kids (close to) her age.  She loves being around people.  For the first time, her earplugs actually didn't fall out at all!  YAY!  (it did take a bit of adjustment every once in a while, though.)  We need to do stuff like that more often, because she fell asleep at their house before we left.  Now, THAT's a first.  Well, tomorrow is the first day of my early schedule at work, so I better get to sleep.  Especially considering that the last 3 nights the earliest I have gotten to sleep was 2:30.  I need my beauty rest.  (and lots of it...j/k)

Abbie-Dabbie and her moma..yeah!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     This was taken around christmas-time, and NO, it is not a copyrighted picture.  We did not go to a photographer...we set up camp right there in my MomMaw's Living Room.  There, we took pictures of the cousins on my mom's side of the family.  (Meanwhile, the reunion last weekend was for my dad's side of the family.  All clear, now!)  So, there you have it, our family picture...isn't it great???

      Ok, so my mouth has a mind all its own.  This morning, it breaks out in canker sores!  What in the world do I have to be stressed about in the summer, when I am not taking classes and work is so boring that I sometimes find myself just staring out into space, day-dreaming, for hours at a time (well, maybe not hourS, just an hour at the most, but still, that's long enough)???  What do I daydream about, you ask???  hehe.  My Hummer!  My future house.  My future job.  Next semester, when I will be a true Engineering student for a change.  I even spend time thinking about the past.  YES, I do mean high school, etc.  As much as I HATED life at FHS, I do think about that time of my life.  That is how slow it is at work.  BUMMER.  It turns out that a girl I work with went to high school with my sis, and she has been asking if I knew this person or that, and it just gets me to reminiscing...about HELL!  Yeah, it sucked.

      Yeah, so our reunion...need I say more? When people come from out of town, one of the first places they want to go is White Sands (at least in our family it is), so we spent an evening there during the reunion. It was so fun! We had dinner, jumping competitions, quizzes for the newbies in the family, sliding races, a drum serenade, and building contests (well, sort of). Dabbie had wanted to go back for a while, so she was looking forward to it, and had a BLAST! She even was sliding down the "mountain" all by herself. (Don't tell my mom...oh, wait, she gets on here. Oh, well. :))  'Twas a lot of fun, and can't wait to go back, but it's more fun if it's not just two of you. However, I can find people to go with us, the question is, do I want to take the time? Eh, sure...but I will let you know.  Dabbie's favorite part of our time at White Sands!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     I am trying to plan a camping trip for us sometime soon. I think she would really like it, and we need things to do to get her out of the house on the weekends, because I work pretty much all day long during the week. (During Summer 2, which begins on Tuesday, I work 7-2...OUCH) If you have any ideas of things we could do, please let me know.

      So, this morning, I am flying on only 3 short hours of sleep.  (I got super involved in my book, of which I was only planning on reading 2 chapters when I lay down to go to bed, but ended up finishing it!)  I do recommend it to anyone who is slightly romantic.  It changed me into one while I read.  But, alas, all good things must, sadly, come to an end.  Hehe!  I don't know exactly what we are planning to do today, but I think we will go to the baseball game tonight.  You know what that means...NAP!  Yeah, baby!  I love those things.  Notice the paragraph at top...I have learned to rely on naps.  Ok, so I am trying to gear up for next semester.  18 hours, and 15 of them Engineering classes.  I dunno.  I think I got myself in pretty deep.  But, I can handle it.  Please pray for me and for Dabbie-girl, that we will have ample amounts of time together.  It's far-fetched, I know, but I can dream, can't I?  Time to go, but I want to leave you with this thought.  If you knew you were going to die tomorrow, what would you do today?

      the best cousins picture I got at the reunion&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Yeah, so like I mentioned, our reunion was this weekend...So nice.  It was too cool!  But, can't you tell how tired the kids were?  Although it was a nice time to run and Chase Bears, and witness Poi, it took a major toll on them.  But, we will have pictures and memories to cherish for a lifetime...well, maybe not Coley and Lauren, but most of the others.  Really cool.  Yeah, this is boring, so I will get some sleep, and then be more interesting in the morning.  Miss me!

      Patriotism rules!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     We went to Sierra Blaca today.  The whopping metropolis...j/k.  So, we went to their Chili cook-off, and, sorry to say, but most of them were too hot for me.  Yes, I am a wimp.  But, Abbie had so much fun.  We even saw an  urlLink American Eskimo ...I swear my heart ALMOST jumped right out of my body!  Memories!  Oh, well...  It was nice, but on our way to pick up MomMaw, there was this huge fire truck with a HUGE American flag hoisted across Mesa St.  Coolio, so, me being the big nerd that I am, I had to get a picture of it, so there it is! (Cue the orchestra)  So, on the way home from our rendezvous to SB, after a long, hot day outside, we get inside the car...for a long, hot ride home.  I was sitting on the SUNNY side of the, uh, street :) ! So I like, FRIED on the way home. (with the A/C, it wasn't too bad, but let me bask in my fry-ness...)  Then, after I got home and put Abbie to bed, I decided to take a long, hot BATH!  BUT, this was my decision, and I had my new book, "Sam's Letters to Jennifer," by James Patterson.  I am such a romantic now...I know, you're thinking, PUH-lease, but it truly isn't me, really.  Well, needing to get in bed, so I am going to cut this short and try to make my 'blog more interesting...either tonight or tomorrow.  Check back again, soon!

      can't you hear the scream?&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     So, there it is, my first picture in the blog!  That day was so fun!  It was so hot that both of us were playing in the sprinkler, and she was having so much fun that I just had to shoot some photos.  Ah, the memories!  That day was the beginning of the end...of our side yard.  That was the day, the men came over and started to obliterate what was left after Mom and Dad added their room.  So much has changed, but I love it!  It looks so different, even to me, and I saw it unfold everyday.  This past weekend for the reunion, some relatives didn't even recognize the house when they came for dinner.  And they had been here only 2 months before!  Good times!

      I know, I know...I should have been doing this a LONG time ago, but I finally took the time to do it.  Expect some pretty interesting things on here...I'm a pretty random in my likes and dislikes.  And, as you might expect, I will mostly be writing about Abbie...hence the address.  Check back soon.

      Today is shaping up to be a wonderful day! The weather is perfect. Cloudy and cool. Reminds me of when we were in Washington. It is 73 degrees outside! Now, THAT'S the kind of weather I like.  Last night, I spent some time with friends because one is visiting from out of town, and there was this  huge  storm. It was nice because it brought the weather on today, but kinda scary.  Today is cleaning day. I have decided to tackle my counters and drawers in the bathroom and get them organized, then, if time permits, go into AbbieDabbie's bathroom and do the same. With school approaching so quickly, I need to get the stuff done on my "To-Do" list. And it's all the kind of stuff that is only done about once a year. Hehe.  Mom and Dad are outside working, and Abbie-girl is running back and forth between them and me showing and telling us about things she is finding (mostly she is finding stuff outside and then running inside to tell me about it :) )  Well, I am looking forward to spending tonight with more friends, but think I need to take Sunday night to catch up on my sleep. I think I got about an hour of sleep last night. I got home, fell into bed and fell asleep at a pretty decent hour, but I woke up about 30 minutes later and could not get myself to fall back to sleep. It really sucked, let me tell ya... Oh, well...that's life.  I am so excited about the concert...only 10 days. And so, for my final thought...some lyrics.   I missed you so much   That I begged you to fly here and see me   You must've broke down   'Cause you finally said that you would   But now that you're here   I just feel like I'm constantly dreaming   'Cause something's gotta go wrong   'Cause I'm feelin' way to damn good      For 48 hours I don't think that we left my hotel room   Should show you the sights   'Cause I'm sure that I said that I would   We gotta make love just one last time in the shower   Well something's gotta go wrong   'Cause I'm feelin' way to damn good      And it's like, every time I turn around   I fall in love and find my heart face down and   Where it lands is where it should   This time it's like   The two of us should probably start to fight   'Cause something's gotta go wrong   'Cause I'm feeling way to damn good, oh   Feelin' way too damn good      Sometimes I think best if left in the memory   It's better kept inside than left for good   Lookin' back each time they tried to tell me   Well something's gotta go wrong   'Cause I'm feelin' way too damn good  , oh   Feelin' way too damn good   Oh, oh, feelin' way too damn good      I missed you so much   That I begged you to fly here and see me   You must've broke down   'Cause you finally said that you would   But now that you're here   I just feel like I'm constantly dreaming   'Cause something's gotta go wrong   'Cause I'm feelin' way to damn good,   oh, oh   Feelin' way too damn good   (I missed you so much that I begged you to fly and see me)   Feelin' way too damn good   (I missed you so much that I begged you to fly and see me)      *  Nickelback   "Feelin' Way Too Damn Good"

      So, the last few days I have been able to spend a good deal of time with AbbieDabbie.  It has been nice for both of us, in general.  There have been times, like this morning, that she tries to pout to get her way or that she is totally Drama-Queen and it really gets to me, but hey, she's still growing up.  She has quite a bit to learn.  (No one holds a candle to Abbie in the Drama-Queen business, and I mean NObody!)  Tomorrow, I am going to take her to daycare in the morning so I can get her enrolled in a pre-school/daycare for next year.  Isn't it so exciting?  She's growing up.  (The daycare we have been using is going down the drain, so I am not going to have her there and needed to find another place.)  It will be nice to have some time to myself tomorrow, but then it will be good when I pick her up and she has learned to appreciate me.  This weekend is going to be pretty busy.  I have a great friend coming in Friday (that's tomorrow!  YIKES!) that I haven't seen since high school.  And another of my friends is having a birthday celebration Saturday, then another of my friends, from a different circle of people I used to hang out with, is coming in Monday.  Sounds like I am going to be pretty sleep deprived this weekend.  That's OK!  I still have a week to catch up on sleep before school starts.  YAY!  (Of course, I still want to hang out with the usual people I have begun to spend time with lately.  Yes, that does mean you, man!)  Shoot, so I have this cool opportunity to get in with a group of people who want to make their own computer game.  I would be the go-to guy for calculus stuff.  Sounds really interesting.  I also said I could give pointers on how to make it more interesting for chicks, but then again, I am an engineer...  (I'm a girl?!?!?  Naw, I can't be a girl!  Hehe)  Once a girl, always a girl, that's how I see it.  Well, we were going to try to go on a walk or bike ride or something before it gets too hot.  I better see if she's ready.  One last thought...has anyone checked out the meteor shower lately?  Last night was supposed to be the best night to witness stuff, and I was totally planning to get up...had my alarm set for 2:15, but I had a hard time sleeping last night, and decided that once I did go to sleep, I didn't need something to interrupt it again.  By any chance, did anyone get pictures???

      I collect elephants.  I have since my freshman year in high school, and even though I haven't gotten many new ones in recent times, I still like to buy more when I come across them.  I have all sorts of elephants...stuffed animals, blown glass, ornaments for the Christmas tree, picture frames, boxers with elephants on them, and ones carved out of materials such as Mahogany and ivory.  And now, a beautiful clay one.  Which leads us to my picture.  I would like to introduce the newest addition to my family!  urlLink     Uhhh...he doesn't have a name, yet.  Bummah...I haven't found one that fits him, yet.  But isn't he a cutie?  (yes, I decided it's a boy)  Earlier this summer, we went to visit my sister in Washington, and we were there for like 2 weeks.  One of the places we went was to a place called The Painted Plate.  It was a place where they had clay figurines and stuff that you can paint and they'll fire it for you.  Of course, you gotta pay for it, but it was  so  worth it.  I know that when I get my own kitchen I would like to go back and paint a couple of plates and stuff to use to decorate my kitchen.  It was neat.  SO, anyway, I picked this cute little elephant-friend to paint and adopt into my herd.  I love the toenails.  :)  Well, probably because that is the kind of color I would use to paint my toenails.  Hehe.  AbbieDabbie painted a beautiful mermaid.  She was still going through the phase where she loved The Little Mermaid movie with Ariel and all.  So, her mermaid has red hair.  :)  Quite appropriate, I think.

      So, today was my last day at work for a couple of weeks.  (I am planning to have to work for a couple of weeks next semester before I can quit...because I still haven't heard from the bank.)  I am so stoked that I have a couple of weeks off.  I have so many ideas of things I can do to spend time with Abbie.  She's watching TV right now, but after lunch, I am planning to take her out for a while.  She wanted to go to the zoo, but I think we need to do that on a day when I did not work for half a day already.  Soon enough.  So, I am in a quandary.  What do you buy a friend for a birthday when you have just begun talking to them for the first time in almost a year?  You know, more than seeing her in the hall and waving to each other...  It is a long story, but we just got too busy and life started happening all around us and ripped us apart.  I am thinking about girly stuff like from Bath & Body Works, but don't know if that would seem too last-resort-ish, you know?  But, hey, I like getting that kind of stuff...mostly because it's for me and not AbbieDabbie.  (Most of what I get goes to her, in a way...Amen if you hear me...:))  Off to another subject.  Next semester is quickly upon us and as much as I am looking forward to it, even waiting for it to come, I am not looking forward to the time away from Abbie-girl.  My heart is torn.  But, not working is going to be a good step to give me more time with her.  Random  OK, another soul-bearing moment.  Do you believe that God gives a glimpse of what He has in store for us sometimes?  It might be to keep us on track or to bring us back, but I think he does.  It's a long story, but I just would like to have some feedback.  You know, to see if anyone reads my blog.  :)  Well, off to the park.  Be back soon.

      So, we went to the park on Sunday.  Just AbbieDabbie and me.  It was cool, and nice to be able to be just the two of us.  During the semester, she usually doesn't see much of me, so I am going to spend a WHOLE lot of time with her during the next 3 weeks.  So, back on track...She was very excited because it has been a while since she was able to go to a park, especially with her Moma.  I love it that she gets so excited when I am able to be with her, but hurt at the same time because that just makes me think she wouldn't be like that if I were able to be with her more often, but you do what you gotta do, right?  So here she is being my Dare Devil!  urlLink     Doesn't she look great?  I  love  that picture.  We're off to get my sister, that wonderful sister o'mine!  (think:  Wizard of Oz.)  So, we went to the airport to pick up my sister earlier tonight.  SO EXCITING!  It's a whirlwind trip, but at least we get to see each other and spend some time together.  It's amazing how much my niece grew in just the month since we last saw her.  Que Chulo!  Well, I need to get in bed so I can get up to go to work in the morning.  Hopefully, I will be able to post pictures of the girlies soon.

      Just my luck!  We washed my car Saturday and what happens?  It rains.  Hard.  Sunday night.  BUMMER!  And I mean mega bummer.  But it's all good, because I know we need it here in the desert.  FYI, we are above the normal rainfall level for today.  YAY!  I guess I should wash my car more often, maybe it would rain more.  :)  It's all good, too, because I was able to go out last night, so I am in much better spirits now that I have had some time to myself, to be an adult.  Just a little pick-me-up for the last 3 weeks of summer.  (School starts in 3 weeks, can you believe it?!?)  You know what that means?  3 weeks until the concert!  YAYAYAYAY!  I am SO stoked!
