      Like eveybody else, I heard a lot about terrorism the day of the WTC destruction. I lived in Berlin Germany as a kid and (1960's) there was a thread of terror that ran from east to west and there was a connection to Lebannon in the hearts of the Germans who educated me. So, I was somewhat familiar with the feelings of hopelesness and despair that cropped up on that fateful 9/11/01. That week in the town I lived there were business places with memos up with the numbers of the planes that went down. Some locals were on board those planes that hit the Pentagon, the field in PA and the WTC. It really intensified the loss and the hurt. It also brought out that unique American spirit of "brotherhood" and defiance in many people I knew and worked with and a month later came out the billboards. The eagles with the defiant look and the odd messages from car dealers that told us that buying a car was somehow patriotic and I guess, would send UBL a signal back in Afghanistan...Stepping back a couple of years was the time I worked in New Orleans. One of the guys I worked with was a huge black Muslim. One day we were in the elevator , about 3 of us and this guy. At the time Farrakhan was very vocal and all over media. His posters were on all the poles around town and this lead to a discussion in the group about his group and what was happening with that group. At that time, as I presume now, newspaper and fruit sales on the bridges and streets of N.O. were hopping. Barkers stand on the street and hawk these tabloid papers directed exclusively to the black population, which, in N.O. is tremendous. No big deal, we discussed these hawkers about on the streets and what came of interest was the fact that the papers were not being sold to white people. Now, I never tried to buy these papers, I don't know if they were connected to Farrakhan or whomever but the white guys in our group said they tried to buy them and couldn't even bribe the people selling to hand them over. We talked about this as how odd this "discriminatory" behavoir was and that was pretty much that except when one of my compatriots wondered aloud "what are these people about?". One of the guys said he had heard that there were ugly sounding plans he'd heard about that had to do with killing white people. Now, please take this for what it was - a couple of white guys in an elevator discussing why black folk selling their newspapers on the streets wouldn't sell the papers to them. It may have been (probably was) all in total ignorance. I wouldn't have remembered this non-event at all except the reaction of the Muslim fellow. He had this evil, non-threatening, "I-know-something-you-don't-know" look on his face. I had not been in this discussion, I have seen papers and fruit hawked on the street but I never bought and I didn't care frankly. But I looked at this guy and I said "you're probably the one guy here who could tell something of interest regarding all this" and he said "oh, there are things planned that I know that I can't tell you about.". He was smiling this evil, knowing smile, in fact, when I see these pictures of UBL on the bad video tapes, I remember this guy.It definitely shut up the others in the group. Now, this guy  would not seem to fit the UBL category but then when I read the descriptions and hear the stories about the hijackers, wow, he would have fit right in. There was something haunting in his tone and this guy was always serious. I only worked with him a few months, don't remember his name, won't look him up, but that was creepy. In fact, a creepy time was had by all in that elevator and we never mentioned it or him again..... Ok, so that went nowhere but it's all true. Soon I hope to summarize the things I have learned about terrorism. Al Qaeda (it's not what you heard) and Wahabbists (the actual culprits in the mideast terrorism currently) in particular. I have serendipitously read through tens of books, hundreds of webposts and many television programs to get to the bottom line of what's going on in this most troubling facet of world events....jimbob (aka MONK) out for now....

      What we know about terrorism, this blobby, fear-shaped thing is hard to describe but is describable. One irony concerning it is that those who live in other countries love to point to American leaders they don't like and call them "cowboys". Ever notice how it's usually the cowboys who are the good guys? The bad guys act more like UBL. Maybe being called cowboy is not such a bad thing....ummm - back to terrorism - In soon upcoming posts I will summarize the various books I have read and all I have learned concerning the topic- specifically the religious bigotry and such underpinnings as Wahabbism. For now I will suggest a few authors and books to read and suggest the list as the chronological order to read them because these build on each other. You get your toes wet then move from there. - Jimbobspaghettibob (aka MONK)                                                           For Starters:                             Why We Slept                             Sleeping With The Devil  (Baer)                             Hatred's Kingdom         (Gold)

      How much suffering goes on in the world in the name of religion? It was reported that more persecution of Christians took place in the 20th century than in all the others combined. There has been a racheting up of this activity and it has been right in our faces and we have not paid attention. During the 90's there was a civil war in the Sudan. In America we heard very little about it and our government ignored it. Worse than that, when asked to help, our esteemed president refused to lift a hand. Blood flowed in the area because Muslim extremists saw fit to take the country over. The Christians who lived in the Sudan took up arms to defend their country. It was a tense struggle that they lost. Now the Muslims control and when they do, the Christian population becomes indentured slaves, if allowed to live. What happened in the Sudan was a blueprint for what was to come in New York. It was a religious war kept secret from us in the west because it was a religious war and we all know that Americans don't involve themselves in religious wars. We just sat and watched while our government killed men , women and children in Waco. Those people had arms and ideology unlike the Muslims who are peace-loving people. Yes, the Muslims are peaceful but that is not the whole of the story. One must ask "which Muslims"?

      In the book The Lord of The Rings, Frodo the hobbit receives a wound that won't heal. It is one of the remnants of a battle to put the world right. Frodo has had to go into the realm of the enemy, take the wounding and press on till triumph. After that victory, Frodo has to go on to meet his Maker. It's a picture of Jesus' battle to put us right, too.There is a picture of it in the Old Testament. I find it interesting whenever the writers of the Old Testament wrote prophecy. It is always God's spirit speaking through someone witnessing about what God has done, can and will do. A most fascinating prophecy comes from King David. A last oracle given begins with the experiences David has had during his life. He speaks of the times that seemed dark and troubling and God rescues him and somewhere in his monologue the voice changes and he begins to speak with the voice of Jesus. In fact, it is Jesus speaking ACROSS THE AGES looking to the cross and beyond to the time when he finally establishes his ultimate kingdom. Christians today often ignore the Old Testament in favor of the New Testament because we rightfully perceive God's mercy and grace toward us as shown in the light of what Jesus did on the cross for us. Anyone who would pour out his own life for another like that must have ultimate mercy towards his friends. (Jesus calls his followers his "friends".) Yet there is an aspect of God that I think we miss today because we tend to prefer the suffering Christ who deals with us gently (or the baby in a manger) as opposed to the old concepts of God who throws lightning bolts at people. This sterner view of God misses the true reality of God just as the softer depiction does. The fact is that God has a full pallette of emotions as we do - He created us with many emotions because we are in His image. There is the deepest abiding love there. There is the most terrible swift judgement, too. And there is unspeakable power to kill and deal with his enemies, be they human or spiritual. I think we often forget that part. I believe we Christians also don't realize that being Christ's follower is not a casual thing. Jesus has made it plain to us that in the judgement (yep! That word we love to hate.) many people will go to Him and say "Lord, Lord, when did we see you hungry yet did not feed you" and then he tells these people who claim to actually have done miracles " IN HIS NAME "  to " depart from me" and then tells them " I don't know you". Many people who claim to be His are going to be shocked. Many people who don't read his Word and think they know him but rather accepted the Sunday School abbreviated versions of those "nice" little Bible stories are going to be tossed out of the kingdom. I think one reason is because there are too many of us who do not walk in the whole counsel of God's word. Picking and choosing the comfortable parts in order to build a "comfortable" spiritual veneer around one's life is dangerous. The Old Testament was written as a warning to us. The dangerous things that happened in the New Testament happened as warning also. Consider Herod. Here was the man who judged Jesus, toyed with him and sent him away. Here's the man who threw Christ's followers in prison and ordered their deaths. When he put Peter in prison, God sent an angel to walk Peter out. Immediately after that Herod takes the glory of the people as his own and God strikes him dead on the spot. Not long after, others die in the wake of the Apostle's as they lie to God's spirit (Annanias) and when one tries to turn people from the faith (Elymas in Acts)loses his sight. People are dropping dead all over the New Testament because they oppose God. It is not all the soft and cuddly picture we often have preached to us. God is merciful and mighty just as we sing but he's also a God of judgement because sin will go punished. Jesus died because of it, death is the price of sin. But don't be lulled to spiritual sleep thinking the story ends there. Don't get this wimpy picture of Jesus because he held his tongue and was killed for it. Some sing a song " He could have called 10,000 angels " to rescue him. He is the creator of all, he didn't need to call angels, with one word he could have called the whole deal off and destroyed the world right then.Just the fact he didn't shows mercy. As the Bible reads in prophecy He is going to ultimately deal with those who are in rebellion to Him, even those who call on Him but it will be too late when it happens because He will not listen. We are warned that God's spirit will not always strive with man's. Here is the voice of Jesus through David speaking of the cross and then the ultimate winning of the battle to establish the kingdom. He will ride a swift horse carrying a sword and woe be it to those who are in His way when he comes, no matter what they think of Jesus or how many verses they mouth....                                II Samuel 22:36                      "You give me your shield of victory; you stoop down to make me great.You broaden the paths before me so that my ankles do not turn. I pursued my enemies and crushed them; I did not turn back till they were destroyed I crushed them completely, and they could not rise' they fell beneath my feet. You armed me with strength for battle ' you made my adversaries bow at my feet. You made my enemies turn their backs in flight, and I destroyed their foes. They cried for help, but there was no one to save them - to the Lord, but he did not answer. I beat them as fine as the dust of the earth; I pounded and trampled them like mud in the streets. You have delivered me from the attacks of my people; you have preserved me as the head of nations, People I did not know are subject to me. They obey me. They all lose heart; they come trembling from their strongholds..."                     NOW, THAT is a depiction of complete victory. It is swift, unrelenting and powerful. This is the power of God in the judgement. There will be no time for excuses or denials. When the sword is finally unsheathed the punishment of evil men, including the weak, spineless liars, the tares among the wheat , that punishment will be brutal and eternal. I think Paul alludes to this when he warns us to "work out your salvation with fear and trembling". We are called to be careful about our witness and what we do with what we know. We are told to be "rightly dividing the word of truth". This targets how we live and how much we actually KNOW GOD - not just about Him.  Know this - Jesus went to Satan's domain, his earthly empire, He took the pain, suffering and temptation so that he could ultimately defeat it and hand you the same victory. We share in his suffering he endured so that we can share in his ultimate glory and feast with him when it is all over.                               Peace !!!

      Now here's something new, a film about Jesus' life that is a word for word translation of the Gospel of John. Here's something really unique about a film covering Jesus' life. It's not cardboard! Jesus here looks at the PEOPLE and ocassionally up at the sky. Jesus also acts like a person rather than an icon and you can really understand why the Jews hated him and how he was disturbing their religious missteps. I have read these words time and time again and I have had glimpses into how the shapers of the pharisaical law would trap people  by the little legalities and rituals they perverted but this film really gets at how Jesus gave them fits. I am totally in awe of the work Mel Gibson did on The Passion and I recommend it to anybody who does not know what Jesus suffered for them. On the other hand, I am recommending this movie to anyone who reads the Gospels and can't quite picture what all the fuss was about from the Jewish leader's perspective. Gibson's film lets you see how the Jews got upset but this film gives you more of a picture of why they were so upset. When Jesus heals the blind man and the Pharisees give him the third degree and then bring in his parents, you can cut the tension with a knife. The dillemna the leaders have with a man who can HEAL (something they could not do) and he does it on the day on which they are not allowed to work and I am telling you - this reveals the frustration these men had. The acting is not spectacular, over the top stuff here, the drama is actually more in the narration and in the moments rather than in a sweepingly grand Hollywood fashion. I give this film a good 4 stars for the first half and once I finish it I'll share with you what I think on the whole.....Jimbob

      Today milestones in space were broken as Senator John F Kerry was launched into space aboard the new political spacecraft SMARMY SPACEROCKET 1. Kerry was the most recent politician sent into orbit behind John Glenn who rode aboard Spaceshuttle Discovery in 1997. About the flight, the ebullient presidential hopeful exclaimed " You know, when I looked down on this great country from space I could almost see Vietnam." The Smarmy spacecraft project was formed when some disgruntled engineers who had been on the NASA telemarketer crews were outsourced to Hawaii. " This country is in a lot of economic pain" Mr. Kerry said while nodding in the direction of his Smarmy Spacerocket Team " You can really see that pain from up in space." he said. The current project is part of a larger one that should eventually put all of congress in a political version of the international space station. " I am looking forward to both Mr. Frist and Mr. Hastert getting new boosts in their careers" Mr. Kerry said. ..... ROOTERS Newsagency                                           HA!

      Ok, so here's the deal. I, Jimbob am confessing that I DON'T LIKE SUMMER! Ok, so I am professing a strangeness to most Americans. Nope, I don't like summers, especially in the south. And Why not? Besides the fact they last forever? It's the HUMIDITY. Aughh! I can't stand it! When I lived in Arizona for awhile as a boy I had a taste of dry heat. When I lived there my dad had a really great car  - a 1969 Chevrolet Malibu with convertible top. When we rode around Arizona in the summer with the top down it was hot! Really hot! I mean, with the air hitting you in the face on a 100 degree day the air felt like you were sticking your head into a life sized blow dryer. That dry heat is really something! The really wonderful thing about it, though, was that as soon as you got under enough shade, especially if there was a breeze, the heat seemed to just dissipate off you. It's like that in West Texas, too. If you can get to shade you will do fine as long as the air is free to flow. Now - this does not at all hold in the southeast. As soon as the moist, warm air goes toward 85 degrees and the humidity climbs to  70 percent or higher, the atoms stop moving. Houston and New Orleans have it the worst in this country, too. When I lived in N.O., it was staggering (and so was I because..) the sun  grabs the top of your head and zones in on it in an attempt to melt you. Get under the shade and it does not matter - the humidity takes the heat along with it. PJ ORourke has likened New Orleans in the summer to being trapped in some athlete's footlocker. That is about right. Where I live now in SC is like that on certain days in the summer. Nothing makes me more uptight, fidgity and uninterested in anything except going to Canada than this humidity. I used to have the saying " It's not the heat - it's the stupidity (of living HERE)" and someday I just know that phrase will totally drop out of my vernacular. Why? Because I will then live in Colorado up high and dry and the worst heat I will have to face is the mountain forest burning down because the timber got too dry and lightning struck a tree. Sometimes I can't win....Jimbob (aka MONK) creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God.   Romans 8:22 We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time. 23Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.

        HILLARY CLINTON HAS HER SAY A tearful Hillary Clinton says she feels betrayed by what she called her husband’s failure to pronounce her queen of America during his presidency or to mention it in his new book. Mrs. Clinton was in Britain to promote an upcoming television documentary about her life entitled Gulping For Breath.   In an interview with the BBC the former first lady said she is disappointed at how eight years in office failed to bring her any higher than senator. Wearing a t shirt that read “ I was in the White House for 8 years and all I got was this lousy senate seat” Mrs. Clinton talked candidly about her husband’s failures. “There were so many people in Arkansas who hurt me professionally as well as personally and when he was disbarred I knew I could never get back at them and pay them for all the cutting things they did to me.” The former president was disbarred from practicing law on October 1,2001. “I mean, how can he do anything harmful without that position?” When she was asked about her personal relations with the former president she declined the offer. “I didn’t expect to talk in detail about the relationship," she said, according to a partial transcript of the interview provided by the BBC.  "But what I was hoping, and did expect was for him to acknowledge and correct the inaccurate and false statements that he, his staff and the (Democratic National Committee) made about me when they were trying to protect his sorry butt," she said. “ That whole healthcare thing was Bill’s idea and I took the fall.” "I have spent many years working so hard to just move on, and to try and build a life for myself," said Mrs. Clinton. The former first lady said she is considering a move to Britain  “since we hardly see one another any more, besides I might get Prince Charles to do something about that nasty queen oversight”.

      Seattle, WA - Alternative rock Lollapalooza concert organizers announced the cancellation of the once popular venue for up and coming artists. " It's a drag" announced Bird Bitley, concert promoter " We had all these fans for so many years who were turned onto the music by Nirvana and now..." his voice trailed off before he put his fist through a wall  " Now the RIAA is shutting us down!" he screamed. The once popular concerts were very highly attended for several years before hitting a recent slump. Attendance was off last year by nearly 89%.Industry insiders are in dispute about what caused the cancellation. According to Bitley, the RIAA claims that the concerts have eroded recent music store sales. RIAA spokesman Lane Plunger said that the Lollapalooza was part of a two step lose-lose scenario for the rock music industry. "The biggest factor to hit music sales was the mp3 Napster downloading and then Lollapalooza began to catch on and the crowds got too big." He said. "With all those young people actually showing up to the performances and listening to the acts without any filters between them and the performers, it was just a matter of time before they realized what these guys really sounded like" he said. Another warning sign for concert promoters was when their parent company sued the 20th Century Fox film corporation. Fox had slated the new movie Lollypoploser, a fantasy film based on the popular children's board game Candyland for a Christmas opening. The Lollapalooza organizers sued claiming the name of the movie infringed on their rights. Then Lollapalooza was sued by the Hershey's chocolate company. It appears that two new chocolate products intended to promote the Fox movie were deemed to be in trade registry conflicts for the end products of the concerts. One is Hershey Squirts, blobs of splattered chocolate and the other candy item is called Chocolate Rollups, a toilet paper-like sheet of chocolate that comes off a roll. "I think this is disgustingly like the concerts themselves!" shouted Mr. Bitley. A Hershey's spokesman was unavailable for comment.- ROOTERS NEWSAGENCY , Jimbobspag reporting

      When I was a kid I spent a lot of time in a car. I think most of my childhood was spent either on a plane, a train or on the road. Consequently I found myself constantly being bombarded with billboard images and fast food franchise signs. The art of the logo was in full swing when I was a kid. Corporate America was in a constant frenzy to get the attention of the family on the road so I guess I was a prime target. What I remember of those days is the barrage of advertising that has been firmly lodged into my brain. Back during the early 1960's through the 1970's a lot happened to corporations. They sank or merged or morphed or geographically fractured and all tried desperately to fit in and be "modern". The odd thing about all this is how the simplist, quaint advertising seems to have survived the times while the really "sophisticated" (at the time) appeals, failed. I remember McDonald's as the second best place for a milkshake and fries. The local drive-in was likely to be number one. I can remember the first Burger King when I lived in Florida and my uncle owned the Burger Chef in Ocala. For those of you who don't know, BC was desperately trying to be McDonald's but never quite got the recognition it wanted. I would say that KFC or A&W Rootbeer, with their frosty mugs pulled ahead of them. I remember when I was really young that the gas stations my Dad went to most were ESSO. We moved to Germany and the whole time we were there it was still ESSO with the cartoon tiger logo fronting each station. Gulf gas stations were everywhere, as were Texaco and Sinclairs with the dinosaur. Years later when my family moved back to the NY, New Jersey area the Esso stations were gone. Now you would call them Exxon. Then when I was stationed in Europe in the military I couldn't help but find Esso stations with the tigers everywhere. The thing I notice in all this is the strange attachments we make to these corporate brands. They tend to define their times and the places we inhabited. When I travel around the country it can be odd seeing a well lit sign of a logo that used to exist somewhere I used to live or still do. Some of the more obscure signs I remember include the Mobil Oil Pegasus. In the rustic Georgia mountains the old timey gas pumps had signs of the pegasus. When I moved to Dallas when I was in my twenties I was pleasantly greeted by the large, glowing pegasus that still flies on one of the tall buildings there. When visiting around the south we would often find Krispy Kremes or Krystals, Hardees or any number of region specific places to eat. Today you can find these in several regions in the country. Now, to prove that this nostalgia stuff is just a passing fancy for me and that there are people who really have this as a full fledged disease or occupation- here is a list of websites dedicated to ferreting out such details as where all those gas station mergers went and what the logos of certain places looked like as well as reminisces...Jimbob   urlLink To Mourn The Loss Of Dead Logos     urlLink Whatever Happened To Those Old Gas Stations ?

      The senate was hushed as Vice President Dick Cheney was confronted by his wife wielding a bar of soap. Mrs. Cheney was responding to salty language used by Mr. Cheney in response to Senator Patrick Leahy. "Your Mom never taught you to use language like that" a fiery Lynne Cheney burst out handing the Vice President a bar of Dial."You need to use this immediately" she yelled. The ordeal came to a swift conclusion as marshalls of the guard dragged the Vice President's wife off the senate floor. Cheney, serving in his role as president of the Senate,had appeared in the chamber for a photo session Tuesday. A chance meeting with Leahy became a heated disagreement about Cheney's ties to giant Halliburton and President Bush's judicial nominees.

      I always like a good action thriller movie. One that is done well that really deserves popcorn with melted butter and a soft drink. I love it when a film gets you deeply engrossed in the characters because you care about what happens to them. It takes a tight script and cliff hanging action that has plot twists where you don't know what will come next. Arnold Schwarzenneger has one I can think of and of course, Harrison Ford and Alex Baldwin each took a crack at the Tom Clancy character Jack Ryan. I like those films, they just move with great pace and have to resolve the ends before it is all over so that the conventions don't show too much. It's not easy to do but the creators of the tv show 24 have done it in spades. I think their success lies in the fact that the events roll out on the screen in real time. If you haven't seen the series and like the types of films I have described,it's not too late for you to see if this show interests you. If you watch two shows and it doesn't interest you then I say that you must like chocolate while I prefer vanilla. I would also point out that YOU DON'T HAVE A PULSE!!! Or something similarly judgemental. The series is about Jack Bauer who works for a counter terrorism unit that is always dealing with Osama-type buddies and Europeans who want to take over the world (like Pinky and the Brain). Ok, fine, but the thing that pulls the tension is that the governmental agency is frought with inside politics and power plays. Not only does Jack have to watch his back in the field - he has to watch it at the office, too. And the stakes are high! His family is in the cross hairs just as much as he is. In fact, Jack Bauer is blessed with one of the stupidest tv daughters ever scripted. His teenaged girl means well and she seems half smart but the dumb half almost always wins out which gets her in mortal danger. And the thing that makes it so realistic here is that Jack Bauer truly loves his daughter and feels helpless to help her because he is about to be strung to a telephone pole and get shot himself. You want Kim to be ok, for his sake and his wife's.  The plot device that really pulls this show together is their use of time. The title is based on the events of one day. And just as in life, we can't be everywhere at all times, this show is crafted with just seconds of overlapping points of view. You see the set up of the trouble one character is falling into and then wham - you are following another one and watching the plot thicken before your very eyes. When you come back to Jack to see what happened to him, something totally unexpected and bizarre is happening to his daughter or his wife and you get just enough glimpse to shout "don't go in the door!"(the 24 Effect) just like you do during the best Hitchcock film. I rented one of the 24 discs through Netflix as a lark, "just to see" and before I knew it, I had bumped all the discs up so we could find out what would happen next. Before I knew it I found myself just itching for the discs of the recent season to be listed so I could start this all over again. I am glad that the Fox people took the leap to air the show. It holds up technically to anything else made on tv that I have seen. I don't watch television anymore, basically, I watch three films a week. I do like some things A&E puts out like the Poirot series or Horatio Hornblower. These are interesting, but nothing grabs my attention and holds me like 24 does. Ok, guys, you can list it on Netflix now, I want to put it in my que.- Jimbob

      My parents watched a lot of television when I was a kid. They watched everything and I think a big chunk of it was just junk. But that's another discussion. One thing my parents never missed when it came on was the Bob Hope specials. My Mom and Dad had an almost "inside" way of viewing live television shows like Ed Sullivan's. They were very aware of the manipulations and certain elements that went into productions. I don't know why I remember this but once when Bob started his monologue at the first of the show, a certain round of jokes didn't seem to be hitting with the audience. Humor is a very tough thing to pull off live. I have seen comics in such situations just "die" out there because the audience was for whatever reason, not ready for those jokes at that time. So, there my parents were, listening to Bob and my Dad looked at my Mom and said "Boy , I bet his writers are going to hear about this when this show is over!". That kind of "look behind the curtain" fascinated me. As I look back on it, I bet he did take his writers to task, he was a professional all the way. Hope had a definite sense of comedic timing and of the way a joke should be structured. He could be read the first line of a newly written joke and tell you what the punchline was. He could see the set up and the denoument in a few words. While Jack Benny made his living off of reaction to the outrageousness of others and Milton Berle was called the "thief of bad gags" Hope had a unique way of expressing funny thoughts. He patented the device of matching "his" middle name to a situation " Hi, this is Bob "patriotic" Hope saying..." and that is really presentational genius when you think about it. Whatever is going on or in need of being supported, he put his own name to it. What better way could there be to endear yourself to a local audience? From there you just hit the tangential topics and the audience is with you. I have known some cynics who really didn't think Bob Hope was funny nor did they like his jokes. I think that's part of not getting him, he wasn't cynical and he wasn't mean spirited. He enjoyed a good time and wanted to share it with the world. I for one, am glad he did. Oh, and you might wonder just how I know so much about Bob Hope? I happened to work (a long time ago) for his road manager for all those tours. That gave me insight beyond any book research as well as a deeper appreciation for Mr. Hope.                                  Jimbob (aka Monk)

      I never knew the guy's names. Joel Chernoff and Levi Coghill were a rock/folk Jewish duo who sang songs about the Messiah. I did know the name LAMB. Theirs was a very different sort of music that included songs regarding Israel and a people's relationship to God. Jews for Jesus had music, too but theirs has always struck me as traditional singing songs like My Yiddishim (spelling?) mother and the like. But LAMB was always on this outlying edge just next to non accessability for gentiles like me but somehow it is affecting music. Somehow it is strangely timeless even though it was stapled into the 1970's scene and went on into the 80's. You can still find their old records by way of Christian Book Distributors and that's a good thing. Chernoff is still recording and has been listed at  urlLink http://www.galileeofthenations.com/  along with other Messianic recordings.It's good to see this movement growing and perhaps the memory of LAMB will inspire new uses for contemporary music in the Jewish realm. I hope so... JIMBOB (aka MONK)

      One thing I despise about American politics is the way it brings out the pragmatic nature of the people to the exclusion of principles. Dick Morris is a man who knows human nature and the players in the political scene both in this nation and others throughout history. His acumen in political spheres is unmatched. His most recent article is about the upcoming election and what he says here mirrors what I have said since 9/11/01. The people in this country want to pretend that terrorism is now neatly wrapped up and all behind us. I noticed something weird about the holidays last year, the trees and trimmings for Christmas went up early. Now, that has always been the case in the retail arena. Year after year we've seen July become the marker for retailers to start advertising for Christmas. But last year the trimmings went up at home early. By Halloween I was seeing lights up. It's as if after two years of warnings and yellow alerts and Usama sightings, people wanted to just get happy for the holidays and have an unapprehensive winter. The war in Iraq did nothing to help this along early in the year. I predict we'll see another full flush of Christmas decorations and parties early again this year but it will be marred by elections.  Morris' latest collumn is about what will swing the election this year. He thinks it won't be party or ideology. Events will drive it. More to the point, the lack of events. In our zeal to put terrorism behind us we will ignore the reality that Bush has been successful in the war on terror. If we are too well protected and things are quiet, Bush will lose. He won't get thanks from the American people but instead the boot. I know that Morris is right here and it's upsetting that human nature can collectively be so lax. Morris points out that it's not the first time. England once reacted the same toward Churchill. Now, I think Bush has made some grave mistakes in the past 2 years. I have been on board with him as far as Al Qaida is concerned. I disagree with him about safety of our borders and military deployments overseas. The war in Iraq has grave consequences for America and the recall of just retired military members is over the mark, in my opinion. However, terrorism is a real threat and it won't go away by november. But try telling that to the American public.  http://www.nypost.com/postopinion/opedcolumnists/24132.htm

      So, I’m a movie fan. I admit it. This is the cheapest  (if you don’t buy popcorn) big entertainment you can get for the money. The only thing I like about summers is that’s when the better movies come out.  And unless you are dead, you know that Spiderman II is at theatres now. I like Spiderman. I used to love reading the comics when I was a kid and when I first heard they were going to lens the webbed one, I was wary. Just how you could tell that story and give it weight? I could not see. Well, as we all know, Spiderman 1 was a terrific success of  a film and I am happy to say that the second film is a rip roaring sequel that bests the first effort. How in the world could they top that ?  I am not going to say this was easy but I’ll tell you what they have done without giving anything away. First, they have such a top notch cast that could make you believe almost any emotion is genuine. Secondly, the editing does not take away from these performances. The film actually takes its time with the characters. As fantastic as this comic book stuff is, it succeeds because it is about the people first and these people have limits. Peter Parker is this guy with fantastic gifts but he’s become a mess trying to handle his time and obligations and answer the question - what does he really want or expect from this life? It’s great stuff and the high jumps and falls (they really hurt to watch) just add to the human drama. Throw on top of that a good antagonist with super power and you have a winner. I give this movie a solid 4 STARS out of 4. Go see it, take the family, take the dog for that matter! Jimbob (aka MONK)

      Rich Mullins...Unfortunate artist...Click on photo for larger version.  urlLink

<date>04,July,2004</date>
<post>

	 
      Rich Mullins died. It was a tragic fact for his family and all those who knew him and loved him and his music. I was not in that crowd.  I first heard him when I was in school working at the student radio station and a song came across the transom called Awesome God. Now this was unfortunate for me because at this very moment there was something awful happening with the word “awesome”. I hated it. Some brilliant person, perhaps in California somewhere, had decided that the word awesome would be fun to insert in sentences as a descriptor for every known state of being just above “totally mediocre”. Kids were going around on campus deeming every totally Unawesome event or thing to be “awesome”.  One might say that the new Frisbee he bought was “awesome” or that the cheese doodles in the bag were “awesome” and so on. It was just at this exact language breakdown of the use of this very word that I , the deejay was handed the song “Awesome God”. I appreciated the tune, the lyric but with the advent of the demise of the weight of that word , this was just one more use (albeit a correct usage) of the word only in connection to God. I could not separate the song from what I was hearing in the dorm, in the cafeteria, on the air and in movies at the time. So I was hindered from becoming a Rich Mullins fan. The fact that this was also one more fully orchestrated, big sounding praise sort of song ala Sandi Patti did not help. I have an aversion to light opera that pretends to be holier than anything just  north of the Beatles. After that scrape with the Mullins song I heard bits and pieces thrown up by the “Christian music industry” to be played on radio.  I used to have a good friend who was a Christian but could not listen to “Christian radio” because he said it “sounded canned”. I know exactly what he meant. CCM radio tends to try to play to the trends in the general radio business, it is either trying to do that or cater to a tone deaf audience that can’t get its head out of certain genres of music.(This is a narrow version of musical life) That's why it tends to sound ten to twenty years behind the times. (It didn’t always do that.) This presents a problem for the artist who wants to be himself and be heard on CCM radio. The stations are not looking for you the artist, they are looking for the clone they can contain, shape and control. If you give them just enough material to fit this mold, you get play. This happens all the time by design and coincidence, sometimes it's because a music producer knows what the industry is looking for.  Poor Rich Mullins, with me he never had a chance. I was so turned off with the material I did hear that I never heard his body of work until recently and that was by a fluke.  My son worked for a while at Habitat For Humanity and once in a great while a store going out of business will unload it’s unopened wares there for sale. One day, a Christian book store dumped their old tapes they hadn’t sold. It was a great 50cent tape sale. And there were Rich Mullins tapes. "Ok," I said, "for that price, I’ll bite." I’m glad I did. But I’m angry at that stupid radio beast and the dopey audience. I have discovered that a lot of Mullins’ music sounds like Don Henly’s without trying to. In fact, in a couple of places, Rich sounds just like Henly himself. Man, what an opportunity the industry had there! They had their own guy who put out original music that sounded fresh and yet could be appreciated by someone who would have liked Don Henly. Doh! He never had a chance. I say -let the artist be the artist! Don’t try to fit him in some mold or make him dance some predetermined dance.  How much talent has been snubbed, ignored, wasted and disregarded out of disrespect for the artist but total respect for a dollar or the tiny audience cume ? Rich Mullins, Bryan Duncan, Mark Heard, Phil Keaggy, Steve Taylor, Keith Green and many others will someday have stories to tell  on this subject . And then it will be too late to matter.                                                                                                                                   Jimbob

      Jimbob does not like eggs. Well, not straight, anyway. No sunny side up nonsense for me. An egg has to be whipped and shaped or covered up with something else in order for it to be eaten. I have always had this reaction to an egg so one day when an acquaintance introduced me to the egg Mcmuffin, I was highly skeptical that it had any chance of consumption by me. I surprised myself. It was quite good and I have perfected the recipe of this humble morning meal. Try it for yourself and see if you like it.  INGREDIENTS:         English Muffin                      1 EGG                      MAYO                      1 Slice American Cheese                      3 Strips of BACON or 1 Slice CANADIAN BACON  Toast the English Muffin and apply thin coat of Mayo. Cook the Bacon till just right. Then in the same pan carefully place an egg and cook till the white is just done lay the cheese on right away.Cut away the excess egg white that would spill out of the muffin.As soon as the cheese and the egg are melted together toss this on the bottom half of the muffin, lay the bacon on top of that. Add the top half of the muffin and voila! It's an amazingly tasty morning meal that doesn't take very long to make at all.

      Every spring and summer it happens. That green stuff in the yard starts to grow tall. Let it grow tall enough and you'll see these dark black and/or green little seeds on the tops of the stalks. Let 4 inches of water fall one day and then about an inch every day after that for two weeks and the grass will mix with weeds towering over your head. How do I know this? Go look at my back yard. I regularly cover about an acre or two every couple of days. I have so far ruined a Briggs & Stratton, Murray and am in the process of breaking down a Toro mower in the process of clearing acreage where I live. I'm hoping for a Snapper someday, just to see how many months before the motor binds. It's fun work! You should try it! I'll lend you a mower that regularly conks out when it gets a bit of water in the engine or hits a piece of wood you can't see for all the weeds. You'll love the experience of pushing and hauling the thing for a couple of hours in near 100 degree heat during the summer. Add some rain for a day and magically you have more work to do. Now, doesn't that feel better? - Jimbob

      IF YOU scroll down or look to the right you'll see the article I wrote about Spiderman II. It is absolutely the best comic book movie ever. I have thought about this film in light of Farenheit 9/11 which many have touted as a super winner at the box office. I have thought about all this in light of recent politics and the fact that Farenheit really hit when the box office was taking a breather. All it did was underscore the fact that too many people in this country are rabid politically. Thanks goes to the people who responded to Spiderman to the tune of 152 million$$. This ensures that fathead will not get too much more fatheaded (he at least has to admit to boxoffice numbers and the distance between the midbottom and the top). To read a terrific Rich article from (of all places) The Times, click the above link. This is everything I have had in my brain about politics, Michael Moore, Spiderman II and the Bush administration but could not pull together in one cohesive article. Thank you Mr. Rich, now I don't have to write it myself. - Jimbob

       NOW HOLD ON THAR BABA LOUIE!  Msnbc is holding a web vote that pits the general online population against the college kids. Just above the link to vote yourself is a mini headline that pronounces that the Berkelely college crowd is blaming everything on Bush. Ok, fine. The implication is that this one campus is speaking for the youts of America. Take the poll and look at how the college group votes. They are overwhelmingly in favor of Bush ! In fact, they are MORE supportive of Bush than I am. ( I am NOT voting for Kerry, either ) In some areas, the college group makes more sense than the general public to date. It's widely reported that the college powers that be have done all they can to shove a leftist, Michael Moore agenda down these kid's throats. If this poll means anything - it's not working! These professors must be crying in their Starbucks espressos. This is a big story and should be splashed on Time next week. At least MSNBC could say something about it. I find it quite interesting that you have to take the poll to find out this rather interesting statistic. - Jimbob

       MAN RECOVERS AFTER BEING SHOT IN FOOT  An Aiken man was in good condition at Medical college after being shot in the foot with a shotgun by unknown assailants early Monday, hospital officials said.         Robert Candy was met by Aiken sheriff's deputies about 1 am at an apartment on Timber Road where he was nursing wounds to his foot and back of his left leg. Candy was not cooperative with authorities.  He told sheriff's officials that three men dressed in black shot him as he walked along Timber Road. He offered no additional description of his assailants. ////Sounds to me like he knows the assailant VERY well, like in the mirror. Barney Fife, where are you???   MAN SAYS GUNMAN TRIED TO STEAL PUPPIES   An Augusta man told county sheriff's deputies that someone attempted to steal his puppies at gunpoint monday night.                    George Milliken told deputies that before 10 pm two people approached him while he was in his yard and one of them pointed a gun demanding his puppies. He told deputies the people were scared off by one of his friends./// Ok Mister, hand over the mutt or it's the big doghouse in the sky for you! Huh?

       I don't watch television much. The weather every now and then. I don't have cable, no satellite, just get a couple of over the air channels. This weekend I did watch some . I'm a great news junkie and when I'm around cable the winner is the zapper looking for news or something of great interest. Well, yesterday I saw another shining example of the news network glossing over the truth. This time it's in the SUDAN. The Sudan is where the Al Qaida types have overthrown a peaceful government and put the Christians into jails to starve, rape and torture them to death. The truth is that this is what these crazed fascists wanted to do here. They blew up our buildings not to make a statement but to take over - if they did, the Sudan is their model of how to do it!!! This stupid tv news reporting is an outrage that has been going on since the Clinton administration. It is being reported but the report I saw Blitzer give was about RACE. No mention that these Muslim extremist goons are linked to the Sept. 11 '01 WTC killings! This is an outrage! The media are continuing the failure to connect the dots. I can only presume this is because they are "embarrassed" about the fact that this is a "religious" oriented war. ... On the other hand, an all too brief mention on the plight of Sudanese was made by John Kasich on his Heartland program. The dots weren't connected there either but a bit of a fuller case was made. The Sudan is not a crisis in the mold of, say, a flood - this is war of spiritual and physical demensions. We can't let this ignorant reporting go on. How anyone can listen to this garbage where they tell us the crimes perpetrated on the people is an anti-black racism move and then show pictures of the Islamic court held by a BLACK&nbsp; MUSLIM is confusing. I don't know if this is on purpose but it's  wrong  !

      If you ask me - 80 degrees in a house is warm. It is borderline stifling and just beginning to get uncomfortable. I don't like it at all and anything above 80 is just unbearable. So I put the thermostat at 80 thinking this was a compromise because my family is just warmer natured than I am. So I learned today that my wife was "cold". COLD , I asked? Cold at 80 degrees? That is the twilight zone between sweating and just about not sweating for me. I thought I was compromising toward the bearable for my wife's sake. WRONG! So, I asked, what would be right for you? I really didn't like that answer - 85. So, I have really done what I think is a favor and put the thermometer inside our house at 85 degrees. I thought I already hated summer. I can only pray for another ice age to get through this, at least when people complain, it won't be my fault.

      When I was a kid the Flintstones were all the rage. Every kid on the blocks (I moved a lot) had Flintstones lunchboxes, coloring books and toys. I never took to the Flintstones. I was enamored (still am) by technology, the space race and astronauts so naturally when the Jetsons first aired, I was hooked. Now I know the animation was  fairly cheap and the same cel for the clouds passed by every few seconds but the technology was just so cool and most of it worked. George even had a robot named Uniblab that got him into trouble and Rosie always kept their house spic and span.Today the Jetsons are popular as a post show memory. Every 6 months or so when I get near a cabled television set I notice a new commercial with something from the Jetsons on it.Sometimes it's just the music or the way the camera zooms past objects  with the flying car whir. I think GE is the latest with something about a dishwasher, Radio Shack was the last I remember where the characters were used to sell celphones. Apparently, I'm not alone in thinking the Jetsons were cool... To honor the Jetsons I grabbed a slice here and there and put together my very own wallpaper of George & family at the flying carwash (seen above). I downloaded the wav file of their flying car sound for my windows sign on and the transition log out is now the Jetsons' doorbell tone. So now I am an official computer geek who likes the Jetsons.- Jimbob

      In an earlier post I spoke a bit about the movie The Gospel of John, that is the first half, with a promise to review the second half when I got to it. Ok, so I got to it and I have to say that the result is a mixed bag. One unfortunate fact is that I viewed this film after having seen The Passion. The Passion is a tremendous work of visuals, music and filmic inflection that deals with the last 12 hours of Jesus' life from the betrayal of Judas to the cross. That film stands as an epic of blood and pain that no film before or probably since, will match when it comes to showing Jesus' story. So, it is probably a bit unfair to do the inevitable and compare the two. Now, I must say that for all of the build up in The Passion that since we already know the story so well (we  being those of us who are believers in Christ) there is a bit of comfortability with the subject to the point that for me, at least, the real triumph came in the final moments of the film. Jesus' triumph over hell and the grave are my favorite scenes. With that said, The Gospel of John stands in Part I to be the best covering of Jesus' early life and ministry I have witnessed. There is a heart there and a soul to Jesus as  shown here. Jesus is genuinely a likable figure. Now, I would like to have seen more of that but then, this is not what the Gospels relate. They don't tell us that Jesus was this great dude with hilarious jokes who was fun to be around. He was a mystery to those who spent the most time with him. The Gospel of John presents that very well.  The real strength in this film lies in the first half and the last half hour. I just gave my reason for the first. The second part of the film relies on earlier footage, to the point that it is almost a repetition of itself to distraction. It is well edited and put together but the pacing is a touch hasty with visits to earlier scenes. Then Jesus goes to Pilate and is put upon the cross, dies and the film itself  then comes quietly to life in the telling of the tomb visitation and Jesus' appearing to the disciples and others. I found the most moving scene to be when Jesus asks Peter "do you love me?" and tells him "then feed my sheep". The way in which Christ persists in this question until Peter breaks into sobs caused me to feel it, too. And then the depiction of the very last lines is wonderful and gives a realistic feel to the events. The Gospel of John is a word for word translation - it is not a harmony of the Gospels, which I find interesting. When Jesus walks on water he is not joined by Peter. That was not recorded in John. That doesn't mean it did not happen, but it's not in that book. I find that fascinating. This is a terrific movie and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a feel for what Jesus may have been like. With John's very words coming to life, you can't beat that.

      INTRODUCING  Dog Wayne . Our first installment of our first story joins our Cowdog hero on the dusty trail. Dog has a recurring role in my Doggington strip. He's the k9 equivalent of John Wayne always showing up in old westerns on television. Here he is my full color foil to teach kids about Salvation through Christ. As I finish the pages digitally I will roll them out once a week so be watching Jimbob's Hangout for Dog Wayne serials. This story will first travel to Bolivia speaking Spanish to children there. While he is Copyrighted he is public domain material strictly for Witnessing. Hope you enjoy it!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

						   This book is for any believers in Christ who want to have healthy spiritual lives. According to Henry Blackaby (and I believe him, by the way) this nation is on the edge of either judgement or blessing. The concern is that we are on the tilt toward judgement. The reason for this judgement is fundamental in the church first and then streams outwardly to the whole of our nation. The cause of it is this: we have lost the fear of God. We have lost the caution with which we are to proceed as a nation before our God. Without sweeping indictments, screaming from on high or blasting the truth from an overdriven amplifier this book's quiet presentation lays the case for the need of true revival in this land. And that revival cannot come without repentance first. When men repent of their sins the LORD is then free to remove the rocks, hay and stubble from our lives. With hearts cleansed and contrite before God a people can then move forward and hear his will. Without repentance as a first step a nation can find itself in a perilous situation. When the Israelites put false gods before their God, they were asking for trouble and indeed, they found it. In fact, the penalties for national apostacy are grievous and should cause trembling. Blackaby is not pointing a finger here but placing a warning sign and a road map for us to follow and find our God. It begins with a healthy fear of Him. Read this short but weighty book and you may find your own way back to spiritual health and new ways to pray for this nation of ours...Jimbob

						   Here is a former Ambassador for Israel writing to anyone who will listen to a hard truth : The Saudi government is deeply in cahoots with Wahabbi terrorists. These are the people we know to be working in league with Osama Bin Laden. The targets are westerners and people involved with religious ministries overseas. This well documented book explains the fence the Sauds are sitting on. The compromise of the Sauds as well as the tenuous nature of their relations with such countries as Russia and the U.S. are frighteningly spelled out here. Dark, shadowy history that is a mystery to westerners comes to plain light in Hatred's Kingdom. Fortunately this book is written so that anyone can understand the issues better. If you are oblivious to the realities of the mideast this book should create a thirst in you to know more of the ties that run from the gas pump to terrorism and how it got that way.

						          Important books are rarely fun. Only occasionally do they have cheerful endings. Seldom do they leave the reader satisfied with the conclusions. Important books reflect reality, and reality is not always cheerful and satisfying.         In The Presence Of My Enemies, by Gracia Burnham, is an important book. Martin and Gracia Burnham were a missionary couple to the Philippines for fifteen years. They were on the island of  Palawan celebrating their anniversary at a resort when they were abducted by Abu Sayyaf, a terrorist group linked to Osama Bin Laden. This book chronicles the harrowing drama that their lives became at the ends of  weapons pointed their way for an entire year.          You might think that missionaries on the field would be “super spiritual” beings who walk victoriously every step like Christian versions of  Rambo. Alas, this book  revises the notion of  what true spirituality may be. During the trek, Martin’s own assessment of his failure to exude hyper-spirituality witnesses well to his genuine spiritual temperament. In the post-traumatic unretouched telling of the year’s events, Gracia’s spiritual quality is attested.         For months the Burnhams were treated like inferior beings by their captors. They bonded with their fellow captives and watched helplessly as women in the group were forced to “marry” their captors. They inferred that a fellow captive had been beheaded after hearing a trio mocking what had been apparently last words. They received care packages from their missions organization, only to watch the sub-human subjugators ransack and ravage goods meant for them. At one point, Martin held replacement prescription glasses just long enough to see clearly a few seconds before the glasses were snatched from him. The Burnhams were shoved into marches night and day as the Abu Sayyaf  men led them in circles to avoid the Philippine army. They lost their shoes, tramped through rough terrain, and waded leech-ridden rivers. The unrelenting dullness of a haunted existence had Gracia at one point thankful to see a leaf a floating down a stream: at least something was getting away.          In Gracia’s candor, she reminds me of me. When she wasn’t mad at her captors, she was withdrawing emotionally and sometimes almost totally “losing it.” I would have, too, if I had had to go through such an ordeal. In fact, my droning prayers would probably have sounded very much like hers: “O God, save us!”          Martin’s self-abrogation defines super spirituality. At one point Martin said, “Here in the mountains I’ve seen hatred, I’ve seen bitterness, I’ve seen greed, I’ve seen covetousness, I’ve seen wrongdoing.” He  explained that he had seen all of this in himself. and he enumerated his moments of spiritual failure. If I had been in his shoes I would have been hard-pressed to find more fault with me than with these thugs. Martin actually turned the other cheek in a horrid situation. Through everything the Burnhams experienced  they held to their faith and shared it with those around them. I don’t know that Martin did as God wanted him to in every event that unfolded, but I am impressed that he had the heart God wants us to have. That is ultimate victory in Christ.           If you really want to know what this world is up against in the real world of terrorists, I recommend you read this book. If Fox’s book of Martyrs were being written today this story might be included. With  supposed Al Qaida groups beheading whomever they deem unworthy to live, this is an important book for empathizing with those families who are tortured by the loss of loved ones.           Terrorism is a serious threat. It is real and it is not going to go away. These sinful, faulty operators want to harm anyone who is not on board with their  radical psuedo-religion based on Islam. This includes you and me. They don’t care if you are an atheist, Buddhist,  Christian or a practicing Muslim who is not a Wahabbi - a radical sect. In one telling incident the Abu Sayyaf  members gun down a bus full of civilians. On board the bus were relatives of the terrorist group. In the blind zeal the deaths are passed off as fate. Read this and you’ll get a good look at men manipulated by Satan himself. It may not be much fun but it could give real insight into what is going on  in this dicey world we inhabit.

						   If you are in need of a good whack on the side of your head or  you think you have gotten dull of mind and spirit. If you think this part of the tapestry we call “life” in this world makes absolutely no sense to you  but you’d like new perspective - try this book.  Philip Yancey has long been one of my favorite  writers. He has pulled me from the brink of total frustration with the church and matters of  faith time and time again. He has no pat answers, he admits when he doesn’t have any answers and is totally honest about what he finds. To wit, he thinks for a living about life and writes it down. Skeptics of Christianity from both inside and outside the church would do well to read anything Philip Yancey has written. In Rumors of another world, Yancey has staked his claim in the physical universe to make sense of what we are told of the existence of a spiritual one. His observations are startlingly surprising and he alone can relate the sex life of cattle to our place in the universe before God. That is no small feat. It is also part of what makes this book a good touchstone for considering the universe God made and why we ought to seek answers to our questions.

						   A strong thread weaves through this collection of seemingly random thoughts about faith. The thread-theme?   God has the power to move you, change and lift you  . You might approach  When God Whispers Your Name  as a daily devotional. A small portion provides enough musing for the day. The points are powerful and weighty, though they sort of "sneak up on you" because of the lightness of the approach. I think of jello laced with real fruit juice and vitamins. Nutrition that is easy to swallow because of light humor and tilted perspective. For example, Moses becomes a janitor (though once a successful corporate executive) working in a building late at night when God speaks from his mop bucket. And Lucado doesn't take himself too seriously; he muses on the photograph of the dog some folks named after him. The last chapter is about a trip to the mountain peak in Colorado and how he and others carried their daughter to the top after she skinned her knee. When she reached the top of the mountain she exclaimed " I did it!" The points that Lucado draws from that anecdote are life-changing. I found myself rereading certain chapters to make sure I had assimilated the nutrition, almost thinking "It can't be good for me if it tastes good." But, easy to read and healthy to consider, this would be a good gift for someone who is about to board a long flight or train, boat or car trip. Worthy reading.

						    P aco Underhill has done a detailed job of underscoring the psychology of shopping. In Why We Buy he goes through every cliche' of this mysterious function of modern life to find the elusive truth. Some of these documented truths sound like cliche's themselves. Men hate to shop but love tech gadgets. Women love to shop but the experience can be stopped cold if the atmosphere is uninviting or too busy or not "cozy" enough. In fact, if anyone wonders just how Home Depot came to be, after reading this book you'll know that can be attributed to one factor : women. In Underhill's world every demographic and psycographic comes under close scrutiny. With armies of investigators sent through malls with video cameras at the ready he has itemized and categorized just about every type of behavoir influenced in malls, department stores and boutiques. What he's learned is a fascinating barrage of facts and styles of different people from all over the country.  If you find yourself drawn to one type of store yet repulsed by the other across the hall this book will help you identify what factors go into your choice. If you are a store owner or manager it can give you some new ideas about how to arrange floor space for better access and improved sales.I found this book interesting because I find it fascinating to learn why people do what they do in groups. If you are like me and find sociology interesting then this book is for you.

						    Augh!  Those people ! Have you ever found yourself saying this about churchgoers? I sure have ! So has Philip Yancey. This book is a diagram of his pilgrimmage from frustration to faith that has helped me immensely in dealing with church members as well as my own position in regards to the church. This book details the shaking of faith that occurs when members of God's church around you fail to live up to the creeds they proclaim. In one excerpt the attention swings into the balance and puts it all in perspective. When The London Times asked for noted people to send in their reasons that the world is so fouled up, G.K. Chesterton wrote  "I AM."  That humbling reply points to my own faults as well as those I perceive in others. The church is made up of people just like me. Broken, fallen admitted losers who know they can't go through this life without help. This is what makes us all vulnerable in the eyes of others.      There is a sense in which this book is a biography. Yancey traces his roots back to the Atlanta fundamentalist church he was raised in and points to the seemingly non-effect of relevance it had in the world. Yet paradoxically, this was where he first caught some glimpse that God was real.  In my own experiences I have found God's people often to be frustratingly non-real or pollyanish. A college classmate once told me that my problem was that I expected church people to think. He pointed out that the church is full of great feelers but not always good thinkers. He was right and this book buttresses some of that. Feelings come in all stripes, good and bad. Often God's people are the hurt ones, that's why they are there. Thought is often sublimated to feelings because hurt people need the balm Jesus provides that makes them feel better. Whatever the reasons, I sometimes go crazy dealing with the irrationality of those who mean well but do the lesser things. We are blessed to have a writer who can speak to this common set of experiences and sort some of it out while maintaining a real and lasting faith all the while. - Jimbob

						    Here is a surprising and refreshing autobiography of the famous preacher from Atlanta, Georgia. Charles Stanley has been speaking for years on the radio and on television so it comes as a sort of revelation to read about his own struggles. Who would have guessed that when he was interim pastor that one third of the congregation wanted him to resign? Or that when he was being voted for the position of president of the Southern Baptist Convention that he did not want the post and was in great strife over it? We often get the picture that preachers have their little frustrations with their members and that the stars of the pulpit just sail through life but this book dispels those notions. In one section of the book Stanley relates how his preaching was going through a successful period. So successful that people were begging him to preach on into wee hours of the night. The problem was that the preacher was himself, dry and lonely spiritually. The path to his healing is a guide for us all!

						     This is without a doubt one of the fastest and funniest books I have ever read. The original Hitchhiker's Guide is simply insane humor that delivers hilarious reading. In the vein of Monty Python, written by a Brit who had worked on Dr. Who (which I have never gotten into) this story just kept me in stictches and I have read it a couple of times and listened to the BBC radio show based on it. I saw bits of the cheesy tv series but it was not up to the book. If you just are bored and have a few minutes it will give you something to smile about. Just the image of giant Vogon earth moving machines poised to demolish the earth to make way for a new interstellar space highway creates an inner smile for me. To think that a passing spaceship equipped with "improbability drive" is what saves Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent from the fate of the earth gives me another one. There are two really terrific stories in the "all in one" volume and it goes down from there till the last story which is just ok. Douglas Adams is no longer with  us and he had the smarts to keep all his projects from being linked so the upcoming movie with the same title is a complete mystery but if it weighs in with the timing and  promise of the first book, it will be worth watching. In the meantime, read the book. 4 STARS OUT OF 4 - Hilarious

						   CSPAN recently aired the talk given by Lt. General Thomas McInerney and Maj. General Paul Vallely when their book was first being published.I don't know if they will repeat this soon but it is sobering watching and a good primer for this book. Speaking of sobering - that well describes the effect of this book. It is the well thought out plan that America could and should have on deck to deal with the mideast. To understand the layout Col. Oliver North provides an extensive introduction good for getting a handle on why we went to war in Iraq. I hope a copy of this resides at the White House. Read this for insight on just what the western forces are up against.

						   If ever there was written a concise, easy to read biography this is it. Neal Thompson has done a thorough and splendid job of covering this complicated man who was the first American in space. From his boyhood to the deck of the aircraft carrier piloting the first jets and then to space and the moon (which Shepard walked on at the age of 47) this book does a fantastic job of showing this man's setbacks and triumphs. The drive and dedication of Alan Shepard was enough to mystify his closest colleagues. He and John Glenn continually butted heads competing to be chosen for that first space shot. The two were considered total opposites but the author points out that their tenacity brought them together and gave each a grudging respect for the other. Neal Thompson worked hard in this book to recreate the look and feel of the times Alan Shepard inhabited. His descriptions of each place are just enough to give you a good sense of what was going on in the world from pre-astro Houston to the Kennedy and Nixon whitehouse so that the colors of the eras become almost  characters themselves.  The author also takes time to explain the technical jargon and certain esoteric language from the military and Nasa worlds. (Homer Hickam even endorses the book)  Shepard's wife Louise figures very much in the story. She was considered the Jackie O of astronauts coming from a favored family in the north she married Alan when he was in the naval academy. Their marriage was solid even through Shepard's own dalliances with other women when he was off on stints for the navy and even later as an astronaut. Thompson is sure not to let anyone think Shepard a saint and even with this terrific telling of the man's life he still comes off a bit of a mystery but as a full blooded man rather than an icon.
