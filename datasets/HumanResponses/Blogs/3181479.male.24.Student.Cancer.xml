      Yesterday morning, I went on a field trip to the  urlLink IBM Almaden Research Center .  It's always nice to take a field trip somewhere and listen to people talk, all while on the clock.  As you can see from the link, the ARC is in the middle of a park, on top of a golden hill surrounded by other golden hills.  Quite a setting.  People there talked about searching the web for stuff, MRAM, less practical physics stuff, and trying to improve IBM's services.

       urlLink Bobby Fischer may soon be put in jail for a game of chess he played 12 years ago.   It was a 1992 rematch against Boris Spassky, whom he defeated to win the 11th World Chess Championship in 1972.  The rematch was played in Yugoslavia in violation of economic sanctions.  This chess match apparently boosted Yugoslavia's economy to the point of making them dangerous to the US, so Bobby now faces extradition from Japan.

      Earlier this week I saw this show called  urlLink "The Grid."   I didn't watch the whole thing, but what I did see was some pretty harsh anti-Arab propaganda.  One of the first scenes of the show was in a free clinic in Cairo.  A woman brings her son in for some simple, easily treatable disease, but because the clinic lacks the money to buy simple antibiotics, her son dies.  Then, as it turns out, the doctor heading the clinic is a terrorist (you might say it was a terrorist hospital), and some woman who I think was his sister tries to talk him out of going to his terrorist meetings.  He says he can't stop going to them, because that would be abandoning his faith, and he can't do that.  After that, the doctor's next patient is someone very high-ranking in a major terrorist organization.  The doctor tells this patient that he just had a boy die for lack of antibiotics, and the terrorist big-wig offers the doctor antibiotics if he would join his terrorist club.  The big-wig also mentions during this conversation that he has safehouses from Cairo to Beirut in a manner that suggests that that was supposed to be impressive.  Let's count the problems with this:      Hospitals, even free ones, in Arab countries are now apparently terrorist establishments.  So next time American warplanes bomb the shit out of a hospital in Baghdad, it's OK, because hospitals are terrorist establishments, and killing terrorists and bombing their buildings is OK.  I'm not aware of that having happened yet, but Israel does regularly bulldoze random people's houses with the only justification being that they were used for cover by militants.  Which is basically equivalent to saying that a firefight took place near there.  Have you ever seen a World War II or Vietnam movie where all American troops strictly avoid using local buildings and structures for cover from enemy fire at all times?     Hospitals could very well be funneling money into terrorist organizations.  So it's perfectly fine to freeze the assets of the Holy Land Foundation, which claims to use its money to feed children, because they just have to be funneling money to Al-Qaeda on the side.  (HLF does funnel money to suicide bombing in a sense, since they provide food to orphans, and the children of suicide bombers, strangely enough, tend to be orphans.  This is all the HLF has ever been publicly accused of doing.)  Charities of any sort run by Arabs are assumed to be funneling money to terrorists until proven otherwise, and this show is helping to fuel that.     The show frames the debate over terrorism among Muslims as one between those with strong faith who are in favor of terrorism and those who are more secularized who are against terrorism.  One example is when the doctor's sister says nothing to her brother's objection that he "cannot abandon his faith" when she asks him to stop going to terrorist meetings.  This is done throughout the show in other contexts as well.  In reality, there are  urlLink well-respected Islamic scholars  who say that  urlLink terrorism is not permissible .  Suicide in general is  urlLink strongly condemned  in the Islamic scriptures.  Of course, you don't see any of this in "The Grid."  All you see is some random redneck's view of Arabs.  Which brings me to my next point...     Cairo and Beirut are not very far apart.  The terrorist big-wig talked about having safehouses all the way from Cairo to Beirut as being some sort of huge accomplishment.  I can't see how it would be, except that Israel happens to be in the middle.  In any case, this guy is supposed to be one of the world's biggest terrorists, so he really ought to be able to have safehouses from Morocco to Malaysia.  How is this propaganda, you ask?  Well, it isn't.  But to me, it indicates that the people who wrote that part of the script  have no idea where Cairo and Beirut are .  They're just rednecks, and now they're responsible for telling what I'm afraid is a significant chunk of the American population everything they know about the whole Arab world.    I'm still deciding whether this show is worse than "Pearl Harbor" with Ben Affleck.

      Here's a list of the top 100 movies ever, according to user voting I've been told.  I've only seen 33 of them.

      Thursday I went up to Berkeley to drop off some rental application forms for a house I may be moving into soon.  When I showed up, no one was there, and the girl who lives there wasn't answering her cell phone.  Rather than wait around for hours for someone to show up, I went to  urlLink school .  From noon to 2 PM there was a  urlLink workshop  for the  urlLink Preliminary Exam .  I got there quite a bit before noon, though, so first I went up to 1015 Evans to take some pictures.       urlLink Looking towards the Bay.    urlLink (2)    urlLink (3)       urlLink Looking farther to the north.    urlLink (2)    urlLink (3)       urlLink Sather Tower.    urlLink (2)    urlLink (3)       urlLink Looking south from the room where the workshop was held.    urlLink (2)    urlLink (3)     The pictures aren't that spectacular because it was a cloudy day.  Maybe next time I head up there it'll be clearer.  I showed up for the workshop about 10 minutes early, because of this thing called Berkeley time.  If someone at UC Berkeley says class starts at noon, that means it really starts at 12:10 PM.  I'd heard about this before, but I thought it was some sort of joke about Berkeley people being late all the time.  I guess not.  The  urlLink girl  teaching the algebra part of the workshop has a web page dedicated to  urlLink her car .

      Friday night, I took a long  urlLink BART  ride to go see an art show/party where some of  urlLink Josh Hagler's  work was on display.   urlLink Guillermo  was there, too.  I got the impression that Josh and Guillermo were both pretty trashed.  Anyway, here are the pictures.     urlLink Josh and Guillermo.     urlLink Josh, Laura, and Guillermo's head, all standing right in front of the women's restroom.     urlLink Josh, Laura, and some guy whose name I can't remember.     urlLink Yours truly.     urlLink One of Josh's paintings.     urlLink A Toyota Scion that was parked outside.

There are a few pictures left that I'll have to fix in  urlLink GIMP  because  urlLink iPhoto  screwed them up.  I think iPhoto just didn't like movies on my camera.  Once I deleted the only movie that was on there, the rest of the pictures downloaded just fine.

      From  urlLink Xinhua Online :  Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom said Saturday that Israel had asked the United States to veto any resolution by the UN Security Council that declares illegal Israel's barrier in the West Bank.  It pretty much goes without saying that the US mission to the UN is going to do just that, since it's fairly unlikely any other members of the UN Security Council would vote against any such resolution, and allowing the UNSC to pass any sort of resolution against Israel just isn't America's style.  The barrier in question is the one the International Court of Justice recently  urlLink ruled illegal , as it violates human rights.  But, apparently, as long as the only humans having their rights violated  urlLink have dark skin and wear funny pieces of cloth over their heads , that's A-OK for George W. Bush.

      BBQ tomorrow.  For directions, check out my  urlLink old blog with a rather retarded hostname .  I do have a pool, so bring your swimming trunks and/or bikinis if you like.  My trunks are in California, but that won't necessarily stop me.  I should add that  urlLink David  is a fan of bikinis.

      I recently saw this on a message board:   the Pope during the Crusades was to Christianity as Osama bin Laden is to Islam.  just because a select few "religious" fanatics declare these two people leaders of their faith, they really do not imply nor practice the true teachings of their religions.   So, apparently at the time of the Crusades, only a handful of fanatics thought the Pope was the leader of the Roman Catholic Church.  Do I need to say anything further?
