      Working for an airline makes for great cocktail party conversation. Everyone has the same comments and questions. So here is my airline FAQ:  Q: Why are your fares so high? A1: It's profitable A2: We don't charge what you WANT to pay, we charge what you're WILLING TO PAY  Q: Are you going to go bankrupt? A: Not likely. There is vigilant cost cutting and no fluffy stuff. I don't even have thumbtacks at my desk - I have to tack things up with unbent paperclips.  Q: Do you get to fly for free? A: Yes - anywhere in the world, possibly first class, but all on standby. That can be stressful if you have to, say, be in a wedding and can't get there. But it's a great perk which is probably balanced out by lower compensation.  Q: Can your friends fly for free? A: No, only family. This makes my brother extremely happy and may even help elicit marriage proposals.  Q: Can they do something about the terrible food? A: Probably, but it won't be cost effective. You don't pick your flights by the food even if you think it makes a difference - you pick them based on convenient flight times and price.  Q: Southwest Airlines has a great business model, they're fun, and they're doing well. Why don't you work for them? A: Guess what? They're too cheap to hire MBAs!

      Welcome to my new diary site. I'm experimenting to see if I like using blogger to make posts - and allow for comments.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Top Ten Things I Learned in Minny  10. There is no random piece of wood that won't qualify as an art sculpture. 9. The Mall of America is just a mall. 8. A T-bone is not just a type of steak. 7. Stowing your car in a parking garage is cheaper than stowing it at the city impound. 6. You still need to turn on the heat in June and August. 5. If you've seen one lake, you have not seen all 10,000. 4. Uptown is SOUTH of downtown. 3. Minnesotans drive slower than your grandmother. 2. There's no better way to spend a summer day than drinking beer on a boat. 1. You can deep fry ANYTHING.  Goodbye, Minny! I might be back...and if so I'll have to spend more time in St.Paul.

      My manager looks kind of like Dilbert's boss.  Though he is much nicer, not evil at all. But he does have those tufts of hair on the side of his head that kind of stick up around the bald spot. And he even has wicked looking eyebrows that stick up like horns as well. He sits on the other side of my cube wall so I can hear all of his conversations. About halfway through the summer he acquired a slinky given out by a consulting firm - now all I hear all day is that slinky "zzzp zzzp zzzp." We call it his pet slinky and it goes everywhere with him. The other day he left a meeting to go back to his desk to get it. No one dares touch that slinky. Fun times here at NWA. Now I'm just waiting to go out for happy hour with my team - I love goodbye parties for me.

      One week left here in the Twin Cities and at work. Most of my friends are done with their internships and that makes me extremely jealous. But the extra money will be useful for my summer travel next year, which I'm already thinking about. Can't make plans too soon to go to Belize or some place like that!  Work was a good experience, now I have to decide if I want to work in the airline industry or not. If I do, I'll come back to Northwest because it is a quality organization. Lunch with the CEO (no, not one on one) convinced me that he is a solid leader - and you gotta like someone who insists every employee take their vacation. He is the kind of guy who can talk to anyone at any level, and that's a skill you can't learn in school.  Pictures from my summer have been posted! Canoe trip, pontooning, bachelorette and wedding, etc. Feel free to comment on my comments.

      Just preparing for my trip to Portland this afternoon. Yes, it's fun to fly for free but there is always the nervousness of wondering if I'm going to get on the flight. And a four hour wait for the next flight if I don't get on. I'm also preparing to present my project to my group.  I'm not too worried - if there is ever a question I can't answer I just say "I'll look into that."
