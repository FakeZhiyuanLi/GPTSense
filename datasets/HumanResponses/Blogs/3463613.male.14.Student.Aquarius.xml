       Well its Saturday alone once again for me. Oh well. Anyway, I've been playing around in Halo's developer mode with different indoor levels and vehicles. And also things like not being able to die so I could go to the bottom of levels like Gefro' and others. Wow, I am so bored right now. I seriously need a girlfriend. Hey, anyone in the Lincoln (Rhode Island) area who is desparate, my AIM screenname is "GarconFrais158".

       This mod is based on the Halo map Blood Gulch. It is after the destruction of Halo and a giant hole down the center is the main attraction in this map. I tried to see if I could get down in a warthog, success.     Then I put a bunch a other vehicles for this pic: Crack O' Mania:

       I have a English poetry research project due on Tuesday. I've got this long weekend coming up (Memorial Day) to work on it. It's pretty easy.   Other stuff going on:   Well, theres not much else going on this weekend. I'm not invited to Brendan's LAN party (see RRunner290's profile) on Friday because I went to the last one so Nick gets to go to this one. I can't wait till Halo 2 so then we can have more than two teams and more than two X-boxes. Well, whatever. Out.

       Finally the HEK (Halo Editing Kit) is here. It also came along with a all-new version of Halo, Halo: CE (custom edition). In this new version of Halo, the new maps people make with HEK can be easily inputted into Halo, just put the file in the "maps" folder and your done. There are already many good maps for Halo: CE made by fans. See  urlLink this site  for most of the good ones. One of the best in my mind is  urlLink Camtrack Arena . See the pic at the end of this post. Anyway, my map, which will probably be VERY bad compared to the others, will probably never get done because of lack of caring about finishing (or starting, heh heh). Anyway, heres a nice pic of the Camtrack Arena's Red Team base:

       Thank you Nick for pointing me to this profile creator. Having a normal webpage got really boring so I decided to try this out. Anyway, welcome to my profile. I'll post more things about Halo when I get around to it.   Responce to Comment: I have that old 50free host that i've been using for image and movie hosting to host pictures and the actual profile itself (as you can see by the filename).

So download it, tell your frineds to download it, and have a fun time!

       These two new maps are awesome. One, name Atalanta (not the city in Georgia, that is how you spell it - it was named after some greek or roman or something god) is the cool interior of a Covenant base, will all cool covenant stuff, like Ghosts and the (sadly undrivable) dropship. And the other, named frost, is (obviosly) a snow level, it is outside, and the bases are so AWESOME, ill get some pics of these sometime. Look for updated.  On a side note, somone, please "comment" on my posts, a couple of people did it, its easy. Just click the thing that says "0 (or 1) comments" and then click "add comment. I want to know how you feel.
