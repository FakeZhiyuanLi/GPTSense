      The Clintons and other Democratic power suits,&nbsp;bad jokes&nbsp;(yes, I'm looking at you Mr. Gore -&nbsp;the "win some, lose some" was funny three years ago, but come on sweetie darling, let it go...)&nbsp; and an avalanche of applause from the already convinced - the DNC is definitely in full swing. Don't get me wrong, anything that will raise another Dem vote, I'm onboard with, but what exactly is the&nbsp;urgency&nbsp;of this particular exercise anymore? I understand they're trying to define the candidate as something more than the Not Bush-ticket, but still. The main goal&nbsp;appears to be sitting still enough in the boat so as to not scare off any on-the-fencers.   Also, I don't get why everyone's been making such a fuss over bloggers being given accreditation this year. Honestly, rather than a show of transparency and an understanding of the new media age&nbsp;and bla bla bla, isn't that just another sign of what a&nbsp;total pseudo-event this is? Reporters out-number delegates eight to one is all I'm saying...   My god, how many times can they repeat  Deep blue sea ? Talk about the worst kind of Hollywood rubbish; Samuel L. Jackson just got eaten by a jumping shark, and man alive (so to speak), did that look fake. And, while I'm no marin biologist, I'm fairly sure that sharks can't swim backwards...&nbsp;Oh, there goes Michael Rapaport! Guess it's not all bad news.

      Spent a lovely&nbsp;weekend with aunt and cousin at their cottage. Friday, walked to the lake after&nbsp;supper, stayed up late and talked over cups of tea. Saturday, early breakfast with aunt B. Her Parkinson's is quite&nbsp;obviously effecting her now, but amazingly, she seems to take it in stride. Breakfast turned into lunch&nbsp;once E got out of bed. Another walk through the fields and a game of Chinese checkers in the afternoon. ( This weekend was brought to you by Merchant Ivory Productions... )   Took the bus back to the city in the evening. 45 minutes late&nbsp;- this&nbsp;my friends is why I&nbsp;visit the countryside instead of live there. And many, many other reasons. J, home from the U.K., came over for supper.&nbsp;Very nice to see her, always feels like the other day, even though it's been six months.   Sunday, spent pottering about&nbsp;the flat, eating&nbsp;chocolate anythings and watching my new  Press Gang  dvd (yeay!). "Have you any idea how humiliating it is to take your escape artist home in a box?". Heh. Best show ever. Still. Get it, you'll see.

      Have to phone S. Have no idea what to say. "Sorry"? "Sorry your sister didn't live to see 19"? It really is the most bloody inefficient, insufficient&nbsp;word in the world. I'm really dreading picking up the phone. Absolutely no idea what to say.  Now I see the point of the blog-thing though. Where else can one moan about one's own uncomfortableness in the face of someone elses tragedy?  Alright, here we go (deep breath)...

      So, I just found out the little sister of a close friend has died. She would have turned 19 this week. The world can truly be a monumentally sucky place at times.
