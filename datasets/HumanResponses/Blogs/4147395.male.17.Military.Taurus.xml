      Stupidity of any kind (even the most subtle, non-harmful) pisses me off severly, as you can probably tell if you've read the rest of my page. Another thing you can probably surmise by scanning my site is that I love beautiful women. The problem is, as much as I love beauty, I hate stupidity, and seeing the two combined makes me want to stick my head in a dryer and repeatedly slam the door on my neck.  Unfortunately for the minor blood vessels surrounding my neck, there are more of this type of woman than any other where I live. It seems like everywhere I look, there are beautiful girls who couldn't possibly have the IQ of a grilled cheese sandwich. Seriously. If you graded the general intelligence level of attractive people in my town on a curve, it would be set by some hot blonde whose smarts rated somewhere around 'functionally retarded.'  The worst part about it is, a lot of these girls think they can compensate for being fucking retards and lacking any semblance of wit by acting like whores. The problem, ladies, is that this solution only works for you if the guy you're talking to is 1) as stupid as you are or 2) drunk. So no matter how many times you show us your boobs, a guy of average intelligence is not going to hook up with you unless your nipples are spouting Everclear.  Seriously. If you fall into this category, don't even talk to me, because you will only piss me off. If you can't figure out whether or not this article is about you, play it safe and don't ask me, because chances are the answer is yes.

      I'm sick and tired of food companies trying to make their products sound hardcore. The worst offender is Pepsi, who right after Coca-Cola released C2 immediately came out with a similar product. But unlike Coke, who engaged in a regular marketing campaign, they took a more creative approach. And by creative, I mean over-used and shitty.  What the hell does Pepsi Edge mean? What's so edgy about a soft-drink? The stupid commercials they use to plug these things are the worst, too. Ooh, the asshole opened a pickle jar. Time for a refreshing bottle of pig shit! Maybe it would be different if Pepsi was actually worth drinking, but it's about as appealing as a glass full of semen. I drank a Pepsi once and shit until my intestines were hanging out of my corn hole. I guess Pepsi is pretty hardcore ... as hardcore as a carbonated beverage can be.  It doesn't just stop with Pepsi, though. It seems like everywhere you look, people are advertising products using either extreme advertising. It's about time, I say. Not having a bag of chips that could kick my ass was really starting to irritate me.  Another bullshit type of marketing is the low-carb advertising campaign that's swept the country. The point of the Atkins Diet is to cut carbs completely out of your diet by refraining from eating junk food. Just because the ice cream or yogurt you're buying only has 7 grams of carbs instead of 27 doesn't make it healthy. It just makes it taste like a plate of ass. You're not doing anyone a favor (besides whatever company you're buying from) by buying this shit. All you're doing is wasting time and money on worthless bullshit.   This got me thinking ... what if low-carb and extreme advertisers combined their efforts and created a product that could that's not only hardcore enough for skateboarders, but also helps you lose weight? Maybe it would look something like this:

      This story chronicles the events of last night at the store. The people who worked with me can attest to the fact that I was the maddest I have ever been at one particular person.  First, let me give you a little background information. There is a group of people who come to the store that live in Delight. They consist of two fat black women, two black men with an intelligence level somewhere between 'barely functional' and 'retarded', one white woman whose eyes I've never seen, due to her gigantic coke-bottle glasses, and a horde (and by horde, I mean an absolute mob) of mixed children. These people come to the store atleast once a week, and always buy obnoxiously large amounts of groceries. They once bought FIVE buggy-fulls of groceries AT ONE TIME, and paid for all of them with foodstamps (pay close attention to the foodstamps comment). Let me be very blunt when I say I hate everyone in this group of assholes. Everything about them pisses me off: the way they look, the way they act, everything.  Now that you know a little bit about them, let me focus this story on the events of last night. It was around 7:30 when they came to the store. Unlike what has become their normal routine, they only got one buggy and began filling it with three of every product we sell in the store. Looking at them was pissing me off so I ignored them the rest of the night and concentrated on mopping the floor.  At about 7:50, they started checking out. The checker rang up all the groceries (none of which were vitally important, at all, I might add) and one of the idiot men took out their foodstamps card to pay. Someone else was sacking their shit, so I didn't pay much attention. While they were checking out (it's around 7:57 now), some dumbass Mexican family came in and started loading up a buggy with a WIC. That is what initially pissed me off. Stupid fuckers ... can't you read the God damn store hours sign on the door? Honestly, milk and cereal are NOT something you need bad enough to keep the store open late. Assholes.  Anyway, it turned out that stupid cockshit had forgotten his PIN number, which he needed to pay for his food. Honestly, if you're not smart enough to remember your PIN number, you don't deserve food stamps. There are starving kids in Ethiopia, yet some asshole gets free groceries who CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER A 4-DIGIT NUMBER! Bullshit.  This went on and on until 9:00. I can't emphasize this enough. Nine o-fucking-clock! The store closes at EIGHT. And the whole time, dumbasses are coming in buying loaves of bread and ice cream and other shit they don't need. I wonder if these people still come to the store when we close on time ... if they drive up and just stare at the door, knowing that nobody's inside, like their whole life has lost its meaning or purpose because they can't come to the store and act like a dickhead.  Around 8:45 I seriously considered paying for their groceries for them just so that they'd leave. That thought lasted a full 10 seconds before I came to my senses and realized that if I helped them, it would be like telling them it's OK to be a fucking assclown. Sorry, I don't support dickheads.  Finally, the stupid bitch called the number on their card, and after answering a few questions got their PIN number. By this time, I am absolutely furious. I mean: fist through the wall, killing little babies, driving over old ladies pissed. I was litterally shaking, and I could FEEL my blood temperature raise. If I had had a weapon at this point, there is no doubt in my mind that I would have lost it and killed everyone in the room. I know you may think I'm exagerating this (since I exagerate everything, except my coolness, which is enviable), but I'm as serious as I've ever been. As it was, the only thing I could do to calm myself down was imagine beating each of these dumbasses in the face with a bat, which I did repeatedly, until they finally left at around 9:15.  The worst part of the whole fiasco was the entire time they were sitting there, they acted like there was nothing wrong with what they were doing. Even one of the people who came in while they were fucking around thought these people were stupid trash ... and this guy lives in a tent!  I have nothing against trash; I'm pretty trashy myself. But I do have something against being fucking retarded, and these assholes are the lowest of the low.

      One thing that pisses me off endlessly is stupid catch-phrases people use, but this one could just be the worst. I absolutely despise it when people say "I'm not racist, but ..." followed by the most racist, bigoted remark they can think of. It's like they think that stating that they're not a racist somehow makes it OK to make hateful comments directed toward a particular race. Why don't these idiots get shot? Seriously. This catch phrase wouldn't work in any other circumstance. Let me give you a few examples:  If a woman says "I'm not a whore." before fucking 12 guys in a row for money, it doesn't make her any less of a prostitute.  If a drug dealer says "I don't sell drugs." while slipping some kid a dimebag, that doesn't mean the kid got the dimebag for free.  If a dickhead says "I'm not racist, but those niggers are buying all my kool-aid," it doesn't mean he's not racist. It means he's a dickhead.  I'm sick and tired of people bullshitting around behind these stupid phrases. If you don't like people of a race, have some balls and admit to being racist. You are not above saying something offensive, and using this phrase is a waste of breath. We can see right through your bullshit. We know you are an ignorant moron neo-nazi bitch.  Why are you racist anyway? What has race x or race y ever done to you? Most people, when faced with this obvious call-out on their bullshit will try to rationalize it with the famous '[race] are coming to the US and taking our jobs!' Nobody is coming and TAKING your jobs. You don't see people robbed of their jobs at gunpoint on the news. No one has their job stolen from them while they're taking a walk in the park. People of races other than yours do not hide in the bushes and wait for a time when you're not looking, then spring out and snatch your job from you before you know what's going on. The reason you don't have a job is simple: you're a stupid, lazy son of a bitch who won't work. Plain and simple. If you don't like the situation you're in, fucking do something about it. Don't hide behind generalizations like this because you're too much of a shitcock to get off your ass and go to work.  And the next time you want to make a racist remark, just make it, and spare everyone your bullshit lines.

      That's right. It's finally happened. Someone has posted a hateful comment on one of my articles about things I hate. So, in traditional asshole fashion, I'm going to rebuke it.  The original message, unaltered, read like this: People posting xxxx loves xxxx over everything might infuriate you, but redardless it is absolutely none of your business. If you don't like what they leave on their away message or anything else THEN DON'T READ IT! It isn't a hard concept. Just because they are in love doesn't mean you have to be a dick about it. Just because your a "pussy" & don't have anybody that loves you or you love doesn't mean that you can be an ass to people who do. It is called jealousy &amp; envy. You are not near as great as you think you are and I think you need to get your ass kicked one good time to change your "cool" attitude. Also, if you were as "cool" as you think..how do you possibly have time to write all those blogs almost every day? I pitty you. Because you not only have a sour ass attitude, you have mood swings worse than most women. Your miserable and pathetic. Obviously your not happy with your own life or something. I feel sorry for every girl that has let your whining ass fuck her. Because she was either a hooker or mentally incapable of making a decision for herself. Because no decent girl would ever think about having sex with you, because you complain way to much. Here is a tip: If you want to get a decent girl.. stop your bitching & grow up. I hate to know that you are going to fight for my country soon. I guess all the REAL men are already over there. My advice to you is to go out in your fucked up vehicle and run it straight into the biggest lake your hick ass has ever seen. I'm sure I'm not the only one who hopes your ass DROWNS in your fucking sorrows.  Let me start off by saying that whoever wrote this (from here on referred to as Chump#1) does have a point: it's none of my business if 'xxxx loves xxxx.' It's almost as if that's the reason I wrote the article ... because I didn't want to know about it, but assholes that do this shove it in my face until there is no possible way to ignore it. Oh wait, that IS the reason I wrote the article. Moron.  In the next section of his rant, Chump#1 says that I have no one who loves me, or that I don't love anyone. This would be a reasonable assumption, if you hadn't pulled it out of your ass. Why would I be jealous or envious of a guy who degrades himself by playing cutesy grab-ass games with the slim hope that he might score with a girl? If I never have to do any of this bullshit and I never get laid again, I consider it a fair bargain. Seriously. What is there to envy? What do these guys have that I could possibly want? Oh, that's right: a vagina.  Next, Chump#1 explains that if I was as cool as I think (and apparently am), I wouldn't have time to write an article every day. What Chump #1 doesn't seem to understand is that I write these articles in my SPARE TIME. I get maybe one hour a night to write one of these articles, and I do it because I enjoy it. Ironicly enough, Chump#1 had the time to write a lengthy complaint on my article. An easily overlooked hipocrisy. Lucky for me, though ... I have Chump#1's "pitty." Listen Chump#1, I know you're a boorish moron (and, by the way, it's YOU'RE, not YOUR), so let me spell it out for you (since you apparently can't): there's one T in pity. Dumbass.  After that, Chump#1 writes: "... I feel sorry for every girl that has let your whining ass fuck her. Because she was either a hooker or mentally incapable of making a decision for herself. Because no decent girl would ever think about having sex with you ..." You more or less hit the nail on the head on this one. Nice job. Although too has two O's in it. No points for you, sorry.  Finally, Chump#1 really drives the point home with this witty bit of advice: My advice to you is to go out in your fucked up vehicle and run it straight into the biggest lake your hick ass has ever seen. I'm sure I'm not the only one who hopes your ass DROWNS in your fucking sorrows. How do you know my vehicle is, as you put it, 'fucked up?' Have you ever seen it? And how do you know I'm a hick? Because I'm from Arkansas? Nice generalization there Einstein. I bet you're racist too, aren't you Hitler? That aside, how could I fucking drown in sorrows? Sorrows are an emotion, and incapable of asphyxiation. I'm sorry you seem to be confused. But of course, you are a dipshit, so it's exusable.  Now, my turn to give you advice, Chump#1. The next time you want to call someone out, and tell them they need to 'get their ass kicked one good time to change their "cool" attitude,' how about you reveal your name or e-mail address, instead of posting anonymously? After all, you kind of lose credibility when you're too much of a chicken shit to tell everyone who you are. Also, I suggest you quit posting to peoples' blogs about how much you don't like them; it makes you sound like a whiney bitch. I'll offer you a piece of your own advice: if you don't like my blog, "THEN DON'T READ IT. It isn't a hard concept."  Your Pal, Charles

      It infuriates me when people who are, or claim to be, in love, insist on flaunting it in front of everybody. I'm not just talking about people who constantly make out in front of other people, either. While that's pretty disgusting, it's almost twice as bad when people write 'I love xxxx' all over everything.  You see this a lot in away messages. Instead of using away messages for what they're made for (like, I don't know ... maybe, to tell us where you fucking are?), these assholes use it to remind all their friends that they are in love, and whoever their significant other is, is way more important than you. The fact is, nobody cares if Julie loves Mark, or Tommy loves Lisa, and we don't need to constantly be reminded that you have a boyfriend or girlfriend.  It's not just limited to away messages, though. Dickwads that write this there, write it everywhere. On notebooks, walls; any palatable surface you can think of will inevitably be covered with 'xxxx loves xxxx'. Who cares? Joni loves fucking Chiachi, but you don't see them cramming it down anybody's throat. I hate this bullshit.  I also hate it when guys play cutesy grab-ass games with girls and call it flirting. I'm all for hooking up with women, and even I will occaisionally play with a girl's hair or something mildly toolish, but some guys act like dickless pantloads when they get around chicks they like. Seriously. Fucking get some respect for yourself, and your gender, you panty-wearing moron.

      Yesterday I met the most absolutely shit-headed woman in the history of the world. This woman (from here on refered to as Piggy) was so absolutely retarded, it was literally everything I could do to restrain myself from bashing her head repeatedly into a wall of metal spikes.  I first saw Piggy after I got off work Saturday night. I came home, and was pretty hungry, so I went out to the shop to ask mom what we had that I could make to eat. On first glance, Piggy looked like every other stupid bitch that shops in a rock shop. She was about 5'2", and looked like she hadn't brushed her hair, ever. She wore a pair of those black jeans that were popular in the 80's, and some kind of glasses that stupid bitches wear.  Understandably, I completely ignored her. Instead of talking to her, I proceeded to ask mom what we had to eat in the house, and before mom could even open her mouth, Piggy responded with 'peanut butter and jelly.' I had to look at her twice before I could even beleive what I heard. I had never seen this woman before, ever, yet here she was, talking like we had been friends forever, or that I gave a fuck about what she had to say. Stifling the urge to beat her with a crowbar, I politely replied, "I need something with protein in it."  Mom interjected at this point and said that there was roast in the fridge. I absolutely abhore roast of any kind, so I asked if there was anything else. That's when Piggy, right on cue, replied with 'Peanut butter and jelly. Ooh, or TOFU!' I nearly lost it at this point. Bitch, peanut butter has 8 grams of protein. I need more along the lines of 40. To get 40 grams of protein from peanut butter, I would have to eat the whole fucking jar. What kind of moron are you? I'd like to see you eat a whole God damn jar of peanut butter, that way you couldn't talk, because your mouth would be full of peanut butter.  Obviously, I didn't say any of this. I just looked at mom and said 'What about steaks?' Fortunately we had some.  At one point in the conversation, mom brought up the fact that Piggy's job was to build liners for garbage dumps, and when she said that, I swear to god Piggy almost had an aneurysm. She said something like: "Ahem, [annoying laugh], I went to college for 4 years. Atleast give it some credit! I build land-fills." And then, for the next twenty minutes she kept repeating this line: "Yeah, I went to college for four years and I build land-fills for a living." Wow, you completed a four-year college. Congratulations, shitface, you've done what only a few million people can do every year. Yay for medi-fucking-ocrity.  The ironic thing is, while Piggy thought she was being witty and clever and completely shutting me down, she spent the entire conversation spending over $500 in my mom's shop. She may have a college degree, but she has the IQ of a ham sandwich if she doesn't realize the money she's spending is going almost directly to me.  Honestly, if a stupid whore wants to give me $500 to listen to her spout of what she thinks are witty comebacks, then by all means, pay up.

      Tonight I witnessed what may well have been the single biggest cockblock in the history of the world, ever. I have seen covert military operations carried out with less detailed planning then it must have taken to pull off this outrageously expansive cockblock.  I was at the races with a friend (from here-on refered to as TheFriend). We started talking to these two girls, who were probably high 3-stars on the Tucker Max scale of female rating ( urlLink http://www.tuckermax.com/femalerating.html ). Only TheFriend is mildly intoxicated, and I'm pretty desperate, so they were probably about as appealing as a 4-star. But that's not really the point of the story.  At one point in the conversation, the girls said "Hey, we're going to go get something out of the car."  Acting on the moment, TheFriend and I said, "Hey, we'll go get something too." Everything was working out magically, and we were mid-way through the parking lot when it happened. The most amazingly choreographed cockblock in history, ever.  In the blink of an eye, guys came from every possible direction, walking faster then any human has a right to, descending upon the two chicks. Apparently, they all knew each other and the guys immediately started up a conversation with the two girls. Before I could even process what had happened, the guys had shuttled the two girls as far away from me and TheFriend as possible, leaving us standing virtually by ourselves in the middle of the parking lot.  TheFriend was more than a little beer-addled, and mumbled something about knocking a few pounds off one of the larger cockblockers. This guy was an absolute tank, and immediately confronted TheFriend with the classic line: "What did you say?"  Naturally, I threw him under the bus. Because ... well, I'm a shitty friend. I repeated the line to the huge dude, and replied with a dirty look. Fortunately for TheFriend, TheTank was a pussy, and didn't push the issue.  As you can probably guess, we went home without girls; but atleast now you've heard the story of the biggest cockblock, ever.

      I wasn't aware of the fact that I was a pussy until someone pointed it out the other day. Apparently, writting on here about bullshit that pisses me off makes me a pussy, because I should say it to these peoples' faces, instead.  First of all, there is no possible way to say some of the stuff on my page to the face of the people it's about. For example, I couldn't possibly tell the hosts of The Weather Channel how much I hate them and their channel to their face, because I haven't and probably never will see them.  Secondly, no matter how much I hate it, there are some people I cannot yell and cuss at in person. For example, if I told my boss that he was a pompous dick and he should go to hell, I probably wouldn't have a job very long. If I got fired from my job, then I wouldn't be able to afford things like a cell phone, or gas for my car. Without my cell phone, you wouldn't be able to send me text messages just saying 'hi,' and I would run out of material for my site.  I think people who say this might possibly be referring to the article about Dustin Staten, so let me make something clear: there is nothing in that article I wouldn't or haven't said to his face. Hell, I fucking invited him to take a swing at me in person; yet I'm the pussy because 'he doesn't have the internet.' So what? The library has the internet. If he was so concerned about what was said about him on the internet, he could log on at the library, do a search for his name and probably find my article. Or, better yet, he could ask me the address to my site. Clearly, he either doesn't care, or is a total moron. Hmm.  But seriously. How could I be a pussy? Just read some of the stuff I've wrote on this page. You have to have balls the size of Dallas to say some of the stuff I've said. Some people think that I'm a pussy because I only say this stuff on the internet. This would be a good assumption if 1) it was true and 2) they weren't crying about it to me ON THE INTERNET. It kind of takes the credibility out of your bitching when you're doing the very thing you're bitching about, you dipshit. Also, I say this kind of stuff in person all the time. I'm constantly talking shit to people, but suddenly I'm a pussy because I do it on here too? Bullshit.

      I fucking hate The Weather Channel. Seriously. A channel that shows the weather 24/7? What dumbass thought this bullshit up? Who could possibly need to see the weather at 3 AM? I can't count the times I've woke up in the middle of the night and the first thing I thought was 'WEATHER WEATHER WHAT THE FUCK'S THE WEATHER?!?!' ... right. Whatever.  As if that weren't bad enough, The Weather Channel is about as informative as watching Bush deliver a speech on TV; it's the kind of thing where you know you're getting dumber as you watch it. Seriously. Watching dogs fuck is more entertaining, and the information value is equal to The Weather Channel. Plus you don't have to deal with the dipshit hosts. I once saw on the Weather Channel where they were talking about a hurricane, and said it would strike somewhere along the southern coast of the United States. No shit, dickwad, where the fuck else would it strike? It's a fucking hurricane. It's not going to magically hop over Texas and go to fucking Oklahoma.  Possibly the worst thing about The Weather Channel is how redundant it is. Why would you watch the weather on TV, when you could go outside and see what the weather is? You're probably saying, "But Charles, you can see what the weather's going to do a week from now on The Weather Channel." That would be a good point, if they could get their shit together and actually REPORT THE WEATHER. Instead, you get to watch some bullshit like 'Storm Stories' where broken families talk about how shitty their lives have been since a tornado tore their house in half. Who gives a flying fuck? Your house is torn in half. We know you're miserable; or would be, if you weren't getting paid 100 grand to sit on this show with your thumb in your ass. Well, I guess you are miserable ... a miserable hypocrit. Enjoy the money you earned capitalizing on peoples' emotions, asshole.

      It's rare that I call someone out on this page. Normally, I like to make fun of a group of people, or use another name to make it unclear who I'm talking about. However, there are certain levels of being a dumb-shit where being subtle is not an option. Sometimes, someone is too much of a whiney pussy to not call them out, and this is one of those cases.  Dustin Staten is the epitome 0f the complete moron; and, as if that weren't enough, he's a fucking pussy aswell.  You're probably wondering what warranted this rant on a single person--what could piss me off so much that I mention their name in an article. Well, I'll tell you. It's not how much of a dumb shit he is, or how much of a pussy, or his whiney attitude. It's how he thinks he's so fucking hard-core. This is a 120 lbs dipshit who thinks he is the baddest of the bad and we should all lick his feet in submission.  To further infuriate me, he quit football today. What was his reason? He didn't like the running. Now, we all know that nobody quits football because they don't like the running. No matter how much you hate it, you put up with it because you like to play. And everybody likes to play, right?  Wrong. The real reason Staten quit is simple. He's a pussy. He's afraid to get hit. This is a guy who lined up against the smallest person on the team in every hitting drill we did. Do you think he did it because that guy needed a fair match in tackling drills? No, he did it because he's afraid to get hurt.  Fucking get over it you wet cunt! Football hurts. It's supposed to. Maybe if you weren't such a panty-wearing faggot you would see that the game is fun as a direct result of the hurt. But then again, you are a dumb shit.  "So what? A pussy quit. How is it hurting you?" you may be asking. Well, hitting Staten was a big part of my reason for living. After all, he's too much of a pansy to swing at me off the field (or cheapshot me, as is the tendency of no-balls assclowns), so I had to take my agression out somewhere, right?  Do the male race a favor, and trade in your sack for a pair of panties, you idiot.

      I'm sick and tired of seeing people say shit like this: "My birthday is September 4th, Independence Day in September!" in an attempt to sound cool or even remotely interesting. There's only one Independence day a year, and it's not in September, dickwad. It's not our fault that you have no personality, and thus have to resort to this mindless chatter to make yourself sound cool, so quit shoving it down our throats. There's nothing special about your birthday, just like there's nothing special about you. If we were in any other country besides the United States and you spouted off this line of bullshit, the penalty would be death. I see nothing wrong with this concept. If you're an idiot, you should be killed, preferably in the most violent means possible.  That said ... my birthday is obviously the coolest day of the year, and should be a holiday. But then again, I am the coolest guy in town, and you are obviously not.

      I absolutely despise text messaging. It is the AIDS of wireless internet. Seriously. This has to be one of the shittiest ideas in the history of the world.  First of all, almost every text message I've ever got looked like it was typed out by an autistic lobotomy patient. You know the type: "hey wz^ nm here brb lol" I can understand an abbreviation every once in a while but this shit doesn't even make sense! I could type a more coherent message by bashing my head against the keyboard right now. You're probably saying something like 'but charles itz 2 hard 2 typ da hole werd lol!!!111' Well, if it's too hard to type the whole word, then it's too hard for me to read it. Which brings up another point:  There's nothing worse then people who think text messaging is supposed to be like a messenger program on the computer. These people text message you just to say 'hey.' You've got a cell-phone in your hand, dickwad, if you wanna say 'hey' you can fucking call me! I'm sick of getting text messages with no point to them. It's too much trouble to sit there and type back on forth to you on my cell phone when I could just as easily call you. Every time I get a message like that my blood temperature raises another 1/2 a degree.  Another thing that really pisses me off is when you get an 'urgent' text message while you're driving. You know, the kind where your phone goes into an eliptic seizure once you receive it. It beeps and flashes like a bad anime show (yes, I know it's redundant to say 'bad anime'). You swerve all over the road to check it and it turns out somebody just wanted to say 'hey.' That's not urgent you asswipe! If I ever have a wreck because of this, I swear to God I will sue you until you have to live UNDERNEATH the streets.  And don't bother text messaging me just to piss me off after you read this, because I'm not even fucking around. I will run you over with my car, and then clean the bloody spot off with your skull.

      One thing that absolutely infuriates me is the bullshit catch-phrases obese dickwads use to try to make it look like they don't care that they're fat. How many times have you heard some blubbering lard sack deliver the classic line "Physical activity? Me? [snotty laugh] You must be kidding." while he filled his blobuous gut with a double cheeseburger and large diet Coke (because everyone knows non-diet drinks are the keystone to obesity)? You've probably seen this happen a lot, and if you're anything like me, it made you want to kick fatass's teeth in.  Another favorite of the morbidly disgusting is this one: I am in shape. Round is a shape. Listen assclown, 'getting in shape' does not refer to an actual shape. It means that you can physicly withstand some type of work without sucking in air through your mouth like you're Monica Lewinsky and it's the last night of your summer internship. This saying isn't cute, it's not witty, and its definately not funny; and you won't be laughing either, when your blood vessels are more congested then a fertility-drug test-subject's ovaries and your cholesterol-clogged heart finally craps out on you after a wopping 32 years of living.  And that brings to mind another point: fat women should not wear 'sexy' clothes, because when you put on that American Eagle spaghetti strap shirt you saw Britney Spears wearing last week, it makes you about as appetizing as a steaming pile of horse shit. Seriously. It's not 'cute,' and it's not sexy. The word is gross. Cover up your disgusting gut (and it is a gut, not a 'tummy') and get some respect for yourself. Just because men are willing to sleep with you does not mean you are attractive. There's always a guy as horny and desperate as you are ugly, so cut the shit and cover up, you nasty fat pig.

      There are about 10 women who come to the store and do this, but I don't know any of their names. Let's call them Wanda, since that sounds like a name a stupid bitch would have. Seriously ... just seeing one of these stupid whores walk into the store makes my blood boil.  When Wanda comes to the store, she always parks in exactly the same parking space, which is without a doubt, either as absolutely close to the store or as far away as she can possibly get. She also has one of these two hair styles: long and a disgusting color of blonde, or short and whiter then my dead grandmother.  Wanda smokes atleast a pack of cigarettes a day; you can tell, because her and her car both smell like the engine room of a freight train. Wanda's overweight, so she has to waddle everywhere she goes at a pace my paraplegic father could beat. She looks around with this blank stare as she slowly creeps around the store, pissing everyone off that she possibly can, while maintaining the cool poise of a complete moron.  When Wanda comes to check out, she will never look the checker or sacker in the eyes as she pushes her over-loaded buggy into the lane. Instead, she pretends she is looking down another aisle, trying to think of something she missed as she slowly inches her buggy toward the checkout. After somebody starts checking her out, she slowly waddles by, and takes no less then 15 minutes to fill out a check. She always pays with a check because that's what all dumbasses do who want to inadvertantly piss everyone off.  No matter how many groceries she has, Wanda always makes the sacker carry them out, and she drives one of two cars: either something compact and shitty that couldn't possibly seat more than her fat ass (read: Ford Contour) or something old that's either white or blue, or white and blue (read: old-school Caddy).  That's the store experience with Wanda. Didn't it piss you off just reading it? You know, I found out one of the Wanda's that comes into the store is a nurse. This is one of the most disgusting people I have ever seen in my life, and she takes care of sick people for a living! She can't even take care of herself! It truly is a fucked up world.

      If you have ever hung out with me in real life, you've probably heard me talk more then once about an old hippy that used to live at my mom's campground. His name was Raymond, and this guy was the quinessential burn-out. The way he talked sounded like he was holding his nose the whole time, and he lacked the ability to process any kind of lucid thought. Here is the story.  When I first met Raymond Dingler (yes, that's his real name. I couldn't make this shit up.), it was during the summer after 9th grade. My mom was out on a date, and me and one of my girlfriends were about to do it when we were interupted by one of my good older friends. We'll call him Lonewolf for the rest of the story.  Anyway, at the time I was driving a piece of shit, 73 Datsun pickup. This thing was a complete and utter shit-mobile, but I was trying to sell it, and Lonewolf had come to tell me a guy was looking to buy it. Now, my initial instict was to tell this guy to go fuck himself and get back down to business with my girl ... however, I really needed money, and he was the only prospect for buying the truck, so I went outside.  Nothing in my entire life could prepare me for what I was about to experience. This guy had the nappiest, most disgusting hair I have ever seen in my life; the hair on his head grew straight up, and the hair on his face grew straight down. He wore large, coke-bottle glasses and a shirt that looked like it had spent most of its life at the bottom of an oil pan. To make matters worse, this guy smelled like he hadn't taken a bath in about 3 years. I mean, it was absolutely wretched. I was reeling from the smell, but I tried my best to make the sale. But, as is the trouble with hippies, he was poor, and couldn't afford the asking price of $500.  I didn't see Raymond again for a really long time, until one winter an old RV pulled up at my house. What set this RV apart from others was the blimp-sized rebel flag flying from the very top of his camper, smacking every electrical line on the way to my house. The hippy had finally returned with two significant changes: his head was shaved, and he stank worse.   The Phone Incident  One of the most memorable nights I had with Raymond was when I was up watching TV at about 3 AM, sitting in front of a big bay window in my house, when out of the corner of my eye I saw a bald head directly outside. I was scared fucking shitless, and I told the person I was on the phone with as much. Eventually I made out Raymond's face from behind his coke-bottle glasses and poked my head out the door.  Me: "Raymond, do you need somethin?" Raymond: "Yeah mee-ann, I need ta use tha phone, little broo."  It's important for you to remember at this point in the story that it's THREE O'CLOCK IN THE GOD DAMN MORNING. No person on Earth should ever ask to borrow another person's phone at 3 in the morning. Period. Anyway, I get off the phone with my friend, and he calls Dish Network, who inform him that he can't get TV because he has a $500 balance to pay with them. I'm too amazed that they answer the phone at 3 AM to realize the comic quality of him owing them $500.  Anyway, at some point during his conversation on the phone, mom woke up, and to say that she was furious would be putting it lightly. She completely lost it on Raymond the following morning. I don't remember exactly what was said, but I can assure you it was loud and profanity-laced.   Band Practice With Raymond  Well, this was around the time I was in the band Liq Wood (or Sundown Method, as it is now called minus me), and we had practice in a shack across the road from my house. Being a burn-out hippy, Raymond was immediately drawn to our loud rock music, and came to practice nearly every day. Some funny stuff that happened ...  -When the drummer was setting up his first set, Raymond offered to help, and the drummer accidentally bumped Raymond's ribs while trying to set up his stool. Raymond went completely ape-shit and told us never to touch his ribs again, rambling for atleast 20 minutes in typical hippy style.  -When we would play, he would hold his head up to the speakers and claim he was getting 'stoned off the vibes, mee-an.'  -When I was tuning my guitar and would say that a string was out of tune, he would quote the line he is now famous for: "Hay-ell-ooh!! Wakeup!! Huh-huh!" If you have trouble imagining him to say that, just ask me to quote it for you sometime.  -In between songs, he would tell us outrageous stories. One included him being at Woodstock and getting stoned with Jimmi Hendrix after the show. Another involved his ability to shoot the head off a chicken from 200 yards with a shotgun. We could bring up the war in Iraq and he would absolutely lose it, using just about every racial slurr for Arabs you can think of.   The Bat Incident  Another time, me, a friend and Lonewolf were playing lawn-darts with a bat and a shovel, (it's Arkansas, give me a break) when Raymond approached us. He quickly engaged Lonewolf in hippy-banter, so we briefly paused our activity, while my friend was still weilding the bat. Upon spotting it, Raymond went absolutely nuts. I distinctly remember him saying: "Mee-an, listen, mee-an ... uh, uh ... you need to put the bee-at down, alright? I've been too many places, mee-an."   The Cop Call  One time Raymond went out to eat with one of his hippy friends. They proceeded to get in an all-out hippy brawl over a can of beans which was supposedly stolen from the other hippy by Raymond. The other hippy leaves Raymond at the restaurant and drives off, leaving Raymond without a ride, who calls the cops. Apparently it's illegal to give somebody a ride somewhere and not take them home.   Brian Moves Out; Hippy Fight Ensues  A guy I used to hang out with named Brian was moving to D.C. during the tenure of Raymond's visit, and when he moved out he put all his garbage out in front of his house. Well, the hippy Raymond got in a fight with over the restaurant knew where Brian lived, and went to root through his trash. Returning with a few treasures, he proceeded to flaunt them in Raymond's face in comical hippy fashion. We were having band practice at the time, and Raymond came into the shack very distraught. The conversation went something like this:  Raymond: "Soo, I heard there was a gee-eye movin outta tee-own, roight?" Us: "Yep ..." Raymond: "Yeahhh mee-an, I sure could use some of his stuff, roight, roight?" Us: "Uh huh. Why don't you ask [other hippy] where he lives?"  Yeah, I'm definitely going to hell.   Indian vs. Hippy  Most of you know old indian Al who lives at mom's campground. Well, rather then walking, he has a yellow moped, which he drives EVERYWHERE. Even if he's just going to the shower, he's riding his moped there. At one point he was across the road, talking to [old guy], when Raymond approached them and engaged them with more hippy-banter.  The problem was (as if Raymond didn't already stink bad enough), on this particular day he had eaten beans and had a few beers, and most of you alcoholics know that's a bad combination. Naturally, Raymond had a little gas ... and by gas I mean he was dropping miscarriages out of his ass every five minutes. Al was not pleased by this, so what does he do? Go to his camper and get away from Raymond. No way. He drives his moped over to his camper to retrieve a shotgun. He then drives back over to where Raymond and [old guy] are, and tells him if he farts again he's going to shoot him. I couldn't make this shit up ... this actually fucking happened. Eventually, [old guy] called the cops and the situation was resolved.   Ending  Of course, we had a lot more outrageous times with Raymond. These are just some of the highlights. It all came to a sad end, though, when Raymond left to get his social security check and never returned. Just disappeared. We don't know what happened to him or where he is, but chances are it's funny.

      Nothing pisses me off more than people who have that 'tortured soul' attitude. You all know someone like the type of person I'm talking about. They are 16-25 year olds who wear box-frame glasses and listen to that pansy bullshit EMO. They have names like Taylor, or Julie, and they spend all of their waking hours acting like life is some kind of huge burden on their undeveloped shoulders. Most of them smoke, and constantly refer to their dependencies on weed to make themselves sound like a bad-ass.  The worst thing about this breed of assholes is that they spend countless hours every day writting the shittiest poetry imaginable, and then cram it down everybody's throat. Just think of all the times you've looked at your buddy list on a messanger program like AIM, seen that someone was away, and checked there message. You probably thought you were going to find out what they were doing, or atleast get some kind of clever anecdote for your troubles; but you were wrong. Instead, you get some broken, non-rhyming, pointless "poem" that over-uses references to feeling bad such as "woe" or "I am cold." You know the kind I'm talking about:  sadness cutting Deeper i am cold take away the pain woe is me  Notice how the lack of proper punctuation or capitalization makes the poet sound like a badass. It clearly shows how he refuses to be bound by rules or fall into an oh-so-dreadful "label." Blah. These fucking sissies need to get the hell off their asses and get a life. I'm so sick of reading this stupid bullshit I could scream. The next time I see one of these berret-wearing faggots, I swear to God I will choke them with a wet fish. Fucking retarded.

      There has never been a band in the history of the world more absolutely horrible than KISS. I would rather watch reruns of The Nanny, sitting on a Chinese bed of nails naked, while Margaret Thatcher humped my leg, then have to listen to one track from any KISS record. They are an absolute abomination to everything that is good about rock, or the entire culture from the 70's and 80's, for that matter. And as if their music wasn't bad enough, every member of the band looks like they were hit by a bus before the show.  To make matters worse, KISS organizes a 'final reunion tour' EVERY YEAR. I don't know how they do it, but every year millions of stupid redneck fuck-heads get in line to see Gene Simmons in a leotard wearing make-up. And as if it wasn't bad enough that every member looks like Crusty the Clown from The Simpsons, they appear to be completely unaware of their level of suckiness. Sucky people usually sit in a corner and sulk about how miserably stupid they are and how much their personalities blow, but not these guys. Nope, they're right there, cramming their shitty lyrics and unoriginal guitar parts down your throat like a pile-driver. Every member of this band should be forced to swallow 12 oz's of their own vomit, and then choked repeatedly with a crowbar; not that this would be a suitable punishment, since they probly take turns giving each other head before the show (so swallowing vomit would be a walk in the park).  Seriously. Their music is shitty, they spend countless hours cramming useless memorabilia down our throat, and make total fools of themselves on national television ... get rid of them.

      Seriously. My town is completely devoid of attractive people older than 18. You could take any one of them as a sample and without changing a single physical characteristic pass them off as a homeless person. I'm not even kidding around when I tell you that these people look like they bathe in a mixture of oil and dirt. The women look like they went to a spa and forgot to remove the cucumbers from their eyes and clean off after the mud-bath. Saying that they fell out of the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down would be an understatement. Rather, lets say that one branch of the ugly tree was dangling over a big pool of ugly, and when they fell out, they took a good 20 year swim in the pool before being born. I couldn't make this shit up.  I don't know who is desperate enough to have sex with any of these people. Seriously, you could compare the psychological pain of doing it with one of these people to giving birth to five children in a row. They are actually THAT unattractive. And as if it wasn't bad enough that they're physically as appealing as a steaming pile of dog poop, they smell almost twice as bad. I'm not exagerating at all when I say that these people smell like a gym sock that has been in the bottom of a locker for 12 years. To top it off, their breath generally smells like something between rotten eggs and spoiled milk. It's absolutely disgusting.  The American medical profession doesn't know the reason for impotence in men, but if you spent your entire life here, it's probably better that it happens. Maybe in a few years all the men here will be impotent and this race of disgusting bastards will finally die out.  I'm not shallow: I know that looks are not all that matters, but it doesn't matter how incredible someone's personality is when looking at them makes you wish you were neutered, and smelling them gives you a headache.  Ugly people should be rounded up and placed on a street somewhere, and then run over repeatedly with a bus until the remnants of their body are indiscernable with the ground.

      This is something a lot of people have asked me about, so I thought I'd tell the story here. Below is the complete, unabridged story of my first time with a girl.  As most of you know (or can probably guess), I was a complete loser from kindergarden to about 8th grade. I mean parted haircut, shirts with dragons on them, didn't talk to anybody loser. A total douchebag, more or less. Yes, that's right ... I, the coolest guy in town, was once a social misfit.  However, the summer after 8th grade I completely let loose. My nights this summer were completely out of control; I spent them breaking almost every law you can think of, and under the influence of more than a few substances. As I continued in this spiral of awesome-ness, I gradually gathered more and more experience with women, although it wasn't until close to time for school to start that I finally sealed the deal with one.  As most of you know, my mom runs a campground, because everybody knows Murfreesboro is a tourist's heaven. Well, a lot of girls go on family vacations with their parents, and after about a week away from their respective boyfriends they are more than a little horny. Because, lets face it, girls are just like us. They want it too. Coincidentally, I was more than a little horny aswell.  Well, I had been fooling around with tourist girls all summer, and had done just about everything but scored. That all changed on a day in July when, and I'm not making this up, one of the hottest girls I have ever seen in my life came here on vacation. I mean absolutely perfect ... a 5 star on Tucker Max's Rating Scale (found here:  urlLink http://www.tuckermax.com/femalerating.html ). Clearly, I had no chance with this chick. Or so I thought.  This, however, was an extraordinary night. It was one of those A-game nights, when she laughs at every little joke, touches you all over the place, flirts the shit out of you, and gives you those 'fuck me' eyes all night. Well, it was probably about 8:00 when the conversation finally came to sex. I'm not sure how it got started, but the best part is right here:  I say something clever. She laughs, then a long pause. Slut: "So ... wanna fuck?"  I swear to God, that's exactly what she said! I almost lost it right there. The answer to this question is obvious.  Skip forward about 30 minutes and we're at some pond-front property we own down the road, naked on a blanket, and I have no idea what to do. I mean, I am completely clueless. Fortunately, this chick was not afraid to take charge, and came prepared (brought a condom, etc.)  Needless to say, she did all the work, and it was, up to that point, the absolute best night of my life.  I still have the bra she wore that night. :)

      As most of you know, this summer I joined the Navy (I don't leave til the end of the year). What you probably don't know is that when you join a branch of the military, you have to go to something too amazingly evil to have been devised by Satan. The first day wasn't so bad, although I should mention that my recruiter drives like an absolute maniac. There was one point where we pulled out of a gas station in between two log trucks, which were going OPPOSITE ways. We were literally 5 feet away on either side from being completely demolished by the front bumper of a Mack truck.  We arrived at the hotel: The Holiday Inn, in Little Rock, Arkansas. My friend (who joined with me) stayed here the night of the Metallica concert (another story for another time). Being that we were joining under the so-called 'buddy system,' we assumed we would have a room together. Obviously, we are complete morons. We ended up in totally opposite rooms with people we'd never met before. I'm not bad at making friends, so this didn't worry me much. That aside, they were serving us a free supper downstairs and I wasn't about to miss out on that.  Now, before I left I had been warned about the food at MEPS, but to say that it was bad would be like saying my ex Sarah had boobs. Those of you who know will agree, that's the understatement of the year. We had a choice of 3 'entres': a club sandwich, chicken strips, or a hamburger. I had been warned about the chicken strips, and since (generally) you get more food in a club, I picked that.  Now, I'm a reasonable guy. When I eat food from a new place, I try to be as gentle about critiquing it as I can. So when I say that this was horrible, I mean pigs would have puked after eating it. The taste of this shit-fest was on par with the way protein shakes taste--right after the first sip, you start getting a sick feeling in the pit of your stomach, and by the end of it you feel like you could puke up your colon.  Adding insult to injury, we were sitting with two of the shittiest conversationalists in the history of the world. One was a white guy who, I swear to God, was about 5'1". He was wearing a green hat and was talking with a ghetto accent. Did I mention he was white? Nothing pisses me off more than white people who think they're black, so I immediately decided I hated him.  The other guy was about 6 feet tall and spent the entire meal talking about how good Black & Milds are and how he was a master of the Kama Sutra. There's just something about people who bring up the Kama Sutra in every conversation about sex that pisses me off. Let me give you gentlemen a tip: by going on and on about tantric sex and how good you are at it in a conversation, you do NOT make yourself sound experienced. You sound like a tool. It's beyond me how anybody like that ever even SEES pussy. Besides, this guy talked with a lisp, and was obviously gay.  After dinner, we returned to our seperate rooms, and right away I realized eating the club was a bad idea. I went in the bathroom and took one of the most historical dumps I've ever taken in my life. I had to flush a total of 5 times through the course of this 30-minute excrement expidition, and I used an entire roll of toilet paper. My room-mate was absolutely mortified by the shit, because it smelled like I pulled a fish out of my ass that had been in a bucket of oil in the sun for 10 years. It was wretched.  After we settled down from that and occupied our beds, we got to talking. This guy turned out to be pretty cool, which was too bad because of what happened later. He said he was joining the Army, and that, if he could get a physical tomorrow, he would be shipping out for boot camp that night.  First of all, you have to be a total moron to join the Army. I mean, seriously. At least in the Navy, I have some kind of promise that I am 99% safe from being shot or blown up. In the Army the only promise is that if there's a war, you'll go there and fight. I don't know what recruiters tell these people to get them to join, but unless they offered me a million dollars in gold bars and a different prostitute for every night of the week, the only way I would ever join is if they killed me and dropped my limp carcass into Army bootcamp. I said as much, and it did not make him happy.  So the conversation dies and we're watching WWE reruns when I remember: I have to get up at 4:00 AM tomorrow (yes, that's when they wake you up). When I bring this up to my room-mate, the conversation pretty much goes like this:  Me: Guess we better get some sleep; early mornin' tomorrow, yaknow? Room-mate: Naww, I was pretty much plannin on stayin up through the night. I never can sleep. Me: Really? Well I worked out this morning, and I gotta get my 8 hours or I'm gonna feel shitty tomorrow. Room-mate: Well I think I'm gonna stay up.  Keep in mind that the TV is absolutely blaring right now, not to mention the contrast is set so high I'm surprised I didn't come out with a tan. Regardless, I try to sleep. Fruitlessly. I toss and turn for an hour, hoping he'll get the picture. He doesn't. I roll over and say:  Me: Dude ... could you put that thing on mute or somethin? I really need to sleep. Room-mate: Uhh ... sure.  His solution is to turn the TV down to barely-audible. Fine, better then blaring. I sleep for what must have been 30 seconds before I'm awoken by the sound of his voice. Turns out this guy's married, and he's telling his wife how much he loves her. I feel kinda sorry for him until I look at the clock and see that it's 1:00 AM. Whose wife is up at 1:00 AM, seriously? I mean, is this woman a prositute or something? I guess if my wife was a prositute, I would say fuck it and join the Army too.  Anyway, I stumble through another 3 hours of sleep and get up at 4:00 because he wakes me up, not because of the wake up call we were supposed to get (and didn't).  This guy must have been a 100 yard sprinter in his youth, because he covered the space between his bed and the bathroom in about .05 seconds, before I even thought about showering. As per my instructions, I had taken my contacts out, so I can't see SHIT. I stumble through the room, get my shit together and ready to shower. We are supposed to be downstairs at 5:00 and this guy is still in the shower at 4:45. His excuse? "Sorry dude, I had to clip my toenails."  CLIP YOUR FUCKING TOENAILS?!!?! I think I almost had an aneurysm when he said that. Clip your God Damn toenails at the house, I have 10 minutes for a shower now, you dickwad. He wasn't pleased when I said that, either.  So, I take my 5 minute shower and get down stairs. I still can't see anything so it takes me 10 minutes to make it. Everybody's in the lobby sitting around, so I attempt to find my friend, which is impossible for 2 reasons: 1) he's not there and 2) I couldn't see him if he was. It takes them an additional 20 minutes to invite us in for the breakfast, which was almost 500% better then the supper. It was really delicious and I ate far more than I was supposed to. I end up sitting with my room mate because my friend's not downstairs, until he walks in literally about 5 minutes before we are supposed to leave for MEPS. I go sit with him, although I couldn't be sure it's him because I can't see. His voice gives him away, though.  Breakfast ends and we go load up on a tour-bus, which drives us to MEPS. We arrive and have to stand outside for about 30 minutes. A lady tells us that we can't have anything on our person, meaning your wallet, cell phone, keys, and all your other shit goes in your bag. Fine. Then I get to the door and I have to take it all out again, because she wants to see my driver's license, make sure my cell phone is off, and make sure I don't have any high-range explosives in my bag. I love our country.  Next thing we get our 'papers.' This is followed by about 2 hours of sitting around wasting time. Finally a lady shows us a presentation, which I can't see, because I had to take my contacts out. I can see they thought this through REAL well.  This is followed by a breathalyzer (to make sure we didn't get drunk while we were on lockdown at the hotel) and 2 more hours of sitting on our asses. A few people start to dose, and I seriously think the Marine's in the room were going to shoot them, had they a gun. But they didn't, so they just yelled obnoxiously in their faces. I guess I should probably get used to that.  Anyway, we eventually start the various inspections we have to go through to be qualified for military service. The most notable are the vision test, the pee test, the physical and the 'exercises.'  I have had a physical before. I play football, so I have had one every year since 7th grade. I know the drill. There are 2 main differences between a football physical and a military phyiscal. If you're from a small town like I am, the doctors are probably just as freaked out about having to grab your sack as you are about them doing it. The military doctors are NOT freaked out about it, at all. They do it extremely vigorously, don't respond to your nervous humor, and generally act like assholes. Then after the genital part of the physical, comes the 2nd difference. This dialogue accurately describes it:  Doc: Alright son, you're ok. I start to pull my pants up Doc: Please bend over and put your hands on your ankles. Me: What did you say? Doc: Keep your pants down, bend over and grab your ankles. Me: What the fuck?!  Anyway, I slowly bent over, but he didn't touch me, thank God. He just looked in my ass with a flashlight. I was later informed he had to check for hemeroids. Guess I'm OK.  The pee test was by far the hardest test at MEPS. When I arrived, I had to piss like a race horse, so I thought it would be a breeze. I was wrong.  First of all, you have to stand 5 feet away from the urinal while pissing in the cup, which is unnatural unless you're drunk. Second, a guy has to watch you do it. Now don't get me wrong: I'm not an insecure guy. I will show you my weiner any time you want to see it. But there is something very disconcerting about standing 5 feet away from the pisser, hunched over your dick which is in a tiny cup, with a small jamaican man watching you. I finally passed the test by pushing as hard as I could on my bladder until pee came out.  The vision test was the last test. Keep in mind, this entire time, I haven't been able to see shit. Completely and totally blind (I'm about 20/400 when it comes to eyes. Bad news.) As soon as I walk into the vision room ... she askes me if I wear corrective lenses, to which I reply yes. Then she says put them in.  WHAT?!?!?!?! It clearly said in my book to leave them out the whole day until after the test. Why the fuck did you just tell me to put them in?!?! I've been stumlbing around this shit-fest for 5 hours blindly for NO REASON?!! I honestly could have beat the living shit out of her, right there. But she was kinda hot, or so I thought (since I was mostly blind). That aside, she was the loudest, most obnoxious women I have ever met in my entire life. Her voice was more terrible to hear then a rusty gate. I was so furious I was shaking, so it took me a while to get my contacts in. When I finally did, I went to take the test, and literally after 3 minutes she told me to take them out again. I nearly shit myself. I told her that if she wanted them out, her redneck ass was going to do it. When she started to, I went to the mirror and did it myself.  The final part of MEPS was a series of exercises with the purpose of dislocating every joint in our body. Seriously, there were about 30 of them, and the 2 groups that went before mine fucked every one of them up. It wasn't that fucking hard ... stuff like kicking your foot out in front and behind you. That kinda thing. Not a big deal. But when you're dealing with a bunch of redneck rejects (over 90% of which are joining the Army, coincidentally), the simple becomes the impossible. Did I mention that we were all in our underwear at this point? We were.  Possibly the worst part of the experience was that the officers could NOT beleive I had never had chicken pox. I swear to God they asked me over and over--atleast 20 times, and I'm not even exagerating this shit. I told the last person who asked me to tell everyone that I had never had them, and that if another person asked me I would tell them to eat my scrote. He didn't like that.  I make it through that and the doctors tell me I've passed everything. Thanks alot, dickwad. Apparently the only qualifications for joining the military are having a face, body and the ability to piss.  After that, I picked a job and signed a bunch of papers, then swore in. My recruiter picked me and my friend up, and we went home as Navy men. Very pissed Navy men.

      This school year is going to the funnest one in history, if you define fun as someone shitting on your face. I swear to god they've done everything they can to make our senior year a living hell. Just look at my class schedule.  1st Period - Comp. This class has 2 redeeming factors that I can think of. #1 Mrs. Ashbrooks doesn't teach it. #2 I only have to take it Monday Wednesday and Friday. Other then that, it's about as appetising as a steaming heap of dog shit.  2nd Period - Electricity and Gas Engines. I took this class last year and blew through it, just like every other Pettigrew class since the beginning of time. Not bad.  3rd Period - Journalism. Another goof-off period. No complaints here.  4th Period - Health 12. This mind dump is taught by Mrs. Stark (or Squirrel, as she is commonly known), which is reason enough to hate it. But, as if that wasn't enough, we are REQUIRED to take this class. I just don't get it: what good do the faculty think having a science class where we learn the same useless bullshit year after year is doing to help us? Seriously. Why should anyone have to memorize all the bone groups in the body? How could this possibly help you AT ALL unless you plan on being a doctor? (and trust me, nobody in my class is going to be a doctor, atleast you better hope not)  5th Period - Oral. OK, the one redeeming factor of this shit-parade is the name of the class. Oral? Come on, administration, you're going to have to try a little harder then this. I'll let you guys make up your own jokes on this one.  Rattler Readiness - Or as I like to call it, the stupid asshole class. Apparently they have decided we don't have enough shit to deal with all day, and have decided to throw in a 20 minute 'remedial' period. If you don't know the definition of remedial, it means 'for dipshits.' Seriously, this is one of the worst ideas I've ever heard of. It's hard enough to make it through the school day without ripping someone's head off ... tacking on 20 minutes is only going to encourage violence. And they wonder why we have school shootings.  6th Period - American Government. I will blow through this class for the simple reason that Mr. Crommet teaches it. I can read this guy like a book. All I have to do is talk about how badly I want to go to state in the mile this year and it'll be smooth sailin. This begs the question, though: why am I taking it? Why not just provide me with another goof-off period, or maybe a class where everyone just sits there for 45 minutes with a gun in their mouth?  7th Period - Football. Atlast, a beacon of hope at the end of my day. Football practice. Possibly the only class all day I will enjoy. Unfortunately, it only lasts as long as the season lasts ... but after that there's always weight-lifting and track to look forward to. Atleast I will have some way of blowing off some steam so I don't lose it during 'Rattler Readiness.'  As you can see, this year is going to blow horribly. In the past, seniors have gotten about 5 study halls and been able to piss away the day, for the most part. They even got to leave at noon! But not us. It seems fate has conspired to make me bash my head repeatedly into a stone wall. Hey, there's an idea for Rattler Readiness!

      For those of you who actively read the original 'Things that Piss Me Off' list (which was in the form of a buddyprofile on AIM), welcome to the new and improved list. All the articles from the old list are gone with the exception of my class schedule. Everything else has been completely deleted, and I'm starting over new. So don't ask me what happened to the other articles or I'll rip your teeth out and shove them in your pee-hole. And while I'm on the subject of how not to respond to this, DO NOT ask me if an article is about you, or who it is about. I'm not going to tell you. I didn't start this to piss people off; but if you read something here and it offends you ... well, piss off. Other then that ... enjoy :)
