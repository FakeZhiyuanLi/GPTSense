      I have been thinking alot this summer. About the next school year, stuff I have to do, why isn't my computer working, what should I use to smash it to peices, how I should edit my last school year's group project to make it better (maybe I'll bring it in to show everyone at corps sometime), and about the website. Anyway, I was thinking that you all out there might have some really good ideas for it (the site). So heres a great spot to list them. I am open to anything you can think of no matter how dumb you may think it is; it may actually turn out cool! So come on in and show me what you got!

      Hey Everyone! There is a new poll for anyone who wants to take it on the home page. The Question? "What are you looking forward to most in this season of corps?"   Anyone have any other good poll ideas? Feel free to get in touch with me!

       Whats up ya'll? Camp is just round the corner and I cant wait to start working on our new show! I have a good feeling about this season. We are going to do great things this year, maybe even win ourselves a competition. The DCI show was awsome! I got to see my Magic buddies play on the field for the first time this year.  I want to go back so bad! Well anyways at camp for all the experienced players, we need to wip the new people into shape and prepare them for the awsome season coming up, but we need not to put them down and act like we are a bunch of hot shots, this will cause problems and will slow our progress way down and we do not want this to happen.  We want to dominate the field from the begining and intimidate the other bands. Make them fear Drum Corps! I hope that everyone has been practicing their exercises and show music. Also you should be exercising and getting in shape because we will probably do some running at practices and you will feel the pain if you do not prepare for it. You will also tire easier during the practices and the show if you dont exercise and we want to have a strong solid show this year. Dont forget the breathing exercises either, it will help you have a stronger sound which is what we expect to have this year. Well anyways I'll see you at camp which for all you who dont pay attention or lose papers or just forget it starts July 26th at 9am but you should come earlier because it starts at 9am so get there around 8:45am or earlier. Make sure to bring water and deodorant and your MUSIC! See you then! Bye Bye.   Luv ya'll, Corey Coomer
