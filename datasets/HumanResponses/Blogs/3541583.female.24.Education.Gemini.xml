      Went looking for intructions for cartridge pleating this morning (not for me - I'm not  that  insane), and thought I'd post  urlLink this nice summary  of pleating methods. I'm using box pleating at the back of the skirt, as it will give me a bit of spring at the back without interferring with a smooth line in the front.

      Last night was dark and stormy (if slightly unoriginal), and so I was glad to have two metres of wool fabric to play with! Seams are all finished on the skirt section, and now I've started on the bodice section. The skirt seams where done in running stitch with a back stitch every four-ish stitches for stability, but the bodice section will be under a lot more strain, and so it is being backstitched all the way. Than I will be on to the sleeves, and finally a note of colour. I'm lining the sleeves in blue silk, cannibalised from a pair of pajama pants bought over at the markets in Sydney. The label said 100% silk, but I didn't entirely believe it, and decided to play with matches for an educational cause:   linen:  (smell) paper/burning leaves (ignites) Takes a while to ignite. The fabric closest to the ash is very brittle. Easily extinguished by blowing on it (residue) powdery ash   cotton:  (smell) paper/burning leaves (ignites) Steady flame. Easily extinguished by blowing on it. (residue) powdery ash   rayon, tencel, viscose:  (smell) paper/burning leaves (ignites) Burns readily with a flickering flame that cannot be easily extinguished. (residue) powdery ash   silk:  (smell) burning hair (ignites) Burns readily, not necessarily with a steady flame. Not easily extinguished. (residue) ash easily crumbled   wool:  (smell) burning hair (ignites) Harder to ignite than silk. Flame is steady but more difficult to keep burning.   polyester, acrylic, nylon:  (smell) burning plastic, acrid (ignites) Catches fire fast but sometimes puts itself out. It bubbles, sizzles and melts. (residue) ash is hard  (Burn Test chart from  urlLink Kass McGann's wonderful introduction to medieval clothing )  Having burnt a scrap of the 'silk' fabric, I can now say with more confidence that it  is  silk. Which is good, because the colour is a beautiful sky-blue that will look great against the ivory wool. I really do need to get hold of a digital camera to put some pictures up.

      No Stitch last night (last minute cancellation), but ended up doing a little bit of stitching anyway. I'm finishing the seams on the wool section of the skirt - just tacking down as (theoretically) wool is less prone to fray than linen, for example. This is my first time working with wool so I guess time will tell if the theory matches reality.  Today's link is" urlLink Dark Age Stitch Types ",  which also has a bit on hemming and seaming finishing/treatments. A bit early for this Tudor piece, but still interesting.

      My number one advice to handsewers out therewould be to use silk thread (well, no, it would be to measure twice, cut once, and always pin and check your seams are on the correct side of the garment, but silk thread would be number three). Compared with using normal sewing machine thread, which snarls and tangles and is generally horrible, silk thread is great. It rarely tangles, it glides through material, looks pretty and feels nice.  If you ever wondered where this stuff came from  urlLink here is a look at the producers , and then  urlLink getting the thread from them to you . My current evil master plan involves finding a class of primary school children willing to look after silkworms for me so I can try out the reeling process myself.  Had a rather bad day at the office yesterday, so last night I consoled myself with bad television and doing the seams on the skirt (ivory wool). Now I need to finish the seams, and then start on the bodice, which might happen at Stitch and Bitch tonight (my sewing group - no bitching allowed if you aren't stitching).

      Well, having started setting up this thing, I have to go and do other stuff... But to begin the sewing updates - the early/transitional Tudor dress currently has the skirt lining and bodice lining sewn (though not to each other yet). White linen and silk thread (which rocks - more on this later).

      For those people that were interested in blogging and/as journalism,  urlLink this article  from Rebecca Blood might be of interest - it looks at what blogs are, what journalism is, and how the two do and don't coincide.

      Having raised the issue of using blogs to create (fictional) narrative in yesterday's tutorial, the www has come up with  urlLink an example  for me this morning (via  urlLink jill/txt ). How might blog fiction challenge traditional notions of narrative, or how might it remain within that model?

        Hi everyone,  Blogs and Macs are really new to me. *still trying to explore* Macs really seem cool, compared to what I have (IBM -_-"). This interface seems familiar to the msn group which I used to go to, but everything seems so different? Oh, is it a must to use Mozilla?  If you would like to know more about Japan, this would be a good site to go to -->  urlLink Japan Guide

      hey there!  the most recent site that i've been to thats really interesting (though not really relevant to this course i must say) is  urlLink www.prisonexp.org  . Its about the standford prison experiment, should check it out, it offers some explanation as to the controversial abuse of iraqi prisoners scandal.  hmm... about bloggers as journalism,  i still have my doubts, because of the issue of authenticity and ethics. but i understand the point that blogs are a great watchdog for checking the media and i fully support that. like its been said before, journalism's ideal is to be objective, but its hardly been that way these days, its wonderful to have people out there to remind them what is important, worthy of the news and what is not. I think that blogs work as a great forum as well.  gen. c",)

      hi. i'm aloy.   er one of the favourite websites i go to is  urlLink achewood . it's an online comic and it's probably best to read it from the start to get more acquainted with the characters. the creator just recently created blogs for all the different characters in the comic itself. so well i guess that should of at least a little relevance to this unit/blog.   why are we forced to use macs? this is confusing.  yeah so that's it for now.

      This is the article Tama was talking about in the lecture today;  urlLink Year of the Blog? Web Diarists Are Now Official Members of Convention Press Corps   The New York Times actually requires you to subscribe to read the full article, but  urlLink registration  is free  We actually touched on this topic in our tutorial today...  I think it's great that bloggers and livejournalers (which I am one of) are able to get press passes to events such as these. The media is supposed to be unbiased, objective, and representative of all view points, but this hardly ever happens. I believe it is up to us (the public online) to point out the issues the mainstream press fails to touch on, and to criticize them like the cynical geeks we are!  Welcome to Self.Net everyone! I hope you enjoy the unit that my life seems to be based on and around.  My name is Kate, I am a geek :)  I'm in my third year of of my Arts degree, which is part of a combined course with Education... in other words, I'm going to be a highschool English teacher in a couple of years!
