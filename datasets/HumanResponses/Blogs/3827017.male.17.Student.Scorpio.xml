      Yea so its Saturday morning and I REALLY wish I could just sleep today.. I HATE waking up...   I'm watching the Real World and theres this black guy named Jacquese, and at the end of EVERY single sentence he says ''You know waht im saying?'' WHY do u need to say that at the end of every sentence.. That kind of pisses me off..  Anyway, I hate John Kerry!!! I really do.. What kind of person will use a movie to help Benefit his political run for president? For those of you who not know what im talking about its  Fahrenheit 9/11 ...Hes a little pussy and should seriously die... He gets a little scrape on his ass during Vietnam and gets a purple heart... its bullshit!!   Thing that REALLY pisses me off is that now that Saddam is captured, the tv reporters are not going to show the real side of Saddam.. Saddam is the modern day Hitler.. Read papers and go online at all the horrific shit hes done to little kids and mothers.. He killed over 1,000,000 of his own people for no fucking reason.. But the news isn't going to tell you about what Saddam is really like because that will make Bush look good... If they tell stories about what Saddam was really like then people would be like ''Wow its a good thing that we captured Saddam. He was a really bad man!'' But Nope... Tv reports are not going to do that because Bush is one sucky president..   Anyway im pisssed now... Lata

As you walk  The path of least resistance Is it that simple As you claim it to be  I stand firm in my solidarity Ihe path I walk (the path I walk) I walk in with my own resolve When darkness falls (when darkness falls) We are reborn A dream since the fall of man We are reborn  but the lives are not yet depleted we are the whole save us of all with not just words let resolution be our voice  I stand firm in my solidarity The path I walk (the path I walk) I walk in with my own resolve When darkness falls (when darkness falls) We are reborn A dream since the fall of man We are reborn  We are the remnant We the remnant will save us of all  We are the faithful We the faithful will save us of all save us of all                  Killswitch Engage~When Darkness Falls
