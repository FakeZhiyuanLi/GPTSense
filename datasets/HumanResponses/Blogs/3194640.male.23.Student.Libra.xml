       Eu decidi começar um blog em portuguêse por que tenho muitos amigos brasileiros e nem todos falam inglês. Que coisa, né?  Vou deixar notícias, fotos, mensagens, etc. aqui diariomente (espero).  Um abraço.

      I'm still working on my worst songs list. I had no idea it would take this long, but it is. Hopefully I should have it up by this weekend.  Anyway, work is pretty busy. School is also busy. Oddly enough, I'm not.   Word.

      I took a short break yesterday. I'm still working on my 50 Worst Songs Ever list.   About  urlLink Jump 's new album,  Between the Dim & the Dark : it's pretty good. I'm a little disappointed that it's not the best album as I've ever heard, but it's still good. "Mexico," "Between the Dim & the Dark," "Young America" & "Daylight" are amazing songs. Get them from  urlLink iTunes  if you can. It's not that the rest of the songs suck. They're just average. I'm sure they'll grow on me.  I also recommend downloading the demo version of " urlLink Daylight " (Don't worry, this one's free). The difference between the demo and the final product are startling. You will be amazed.  Word.

      I had one heck of a weekend-- not really. I didn't do anything really.   Thankfully, don't have class today, which is cool. I'm not sure what I'm going to do today other than work. I'm at work right now. We're still listening to the 70's station on our satellite radio. I hate "Stayin' Alive." I've heard it so much that I think I've got it memorized by now.   Speaking of crappy music,  urlLink Blender  just released their  urlLink list  of the  urlLink 50 Worst Songs Ever . I'm all for informing the public of what songs not to listen to, but this is the worst list ever of crappy songs. I agree with them on some of their choices (i.e. "My Heart Will Go On"), but The Beatles' "Ob-La-Di-Ob-La-Da"? Simon & Garfunkel's "Sounds of Silence"? These songs are classics! How did these songs make the list? It doesn't make sense to me. I'm sure we can all think of at least 10 really crappy songs that did not make the list ("Mmmbop," "The Macarena," "The Sign"...), but should have. I would like to think that I have better musical tastes than these guys. I would never trust anyone at Blender to make me a mixtape. I'll post my own list of the 50 Worst Songs Ever later this week.   About some good music: I just "purchased" (I got it from  urlLink iTunes  using my free song credits, courtesy of  urlLink Pepsi )  urlLink Jump's  (formerly known as Jump Little Children) new album  Between the Dim & the Dark  Saturday. I haven't been able to make it through the whole album yet, but what songs I have heard are amazing. The band's lead singer,  urlLink Jay Clifford , has an awesomely unique voice (for an amazing display of Jay's talent, check out "Cathedral" from their "debut,"  Magazine ). Jump is fast becoming one of my favorite bands. I'll post a full review of the album later.  Word.

      I am bored at work. This is usual for me. If I wasn't bored at work I'd be bored at home or at school. I figured I'd start a blog to help keep myself occupied and also to help me ignore the country music satellite station playing here at work. I am not a country fan.   There is always music playing on the overhead speakers here at work. It's supposed to help our morale as we deal with irrate customers here at our customer service center. I can tell you that it doesn't work very well. It's not that I hate music. I love music. I just don't love the music I'm forced to listen to on a daily basis.   Usually (four and a half days out of five), we'll listen to either the 80's station or the 70's station. The same songs are played all day every day. Finally, after nearly a week, someone will change the station to a decent one with a good mix of music. You'd think that would satisfy everyone. Unfortunately, you can't please all the people all the time. Inevitably, someone (who hates modern music) will switch the station to the country station. On Monday, the cycle will start all over again. To quote the great philosopher Garfield, "I hate Mondays."  ____________________________________________________________   On another note: In a turn of wicked events, I finally watched  urlLink Kill Bill  Volumes 1 & 2. I probably shouldn't have watched them, but I did. I liked the music from the movies so much that I bought soundtrack. Amazing! I think those who were surprised to see Quentin Tarantino on  urlLink American Idol  the other week should take a listen. This man knows his music!   Speaking of  urlLink American Idol , people are really worked up over America's  urlLink decision  to vote off Jennifer Hudson. I think I was as shocked as the rest of the country. I was even more shocked that the three best performers were in the bottom three. I will tell you now that if either John Stevens, Diana DeGarmo or Jasmine Trias wins, their record sales will equal those of  urlLink Justin Guarini  (FYI: Record sales were dismal and his record label gave him the boot. He found out he was dropped while reading a magazine article. Sad). Maybe I should start voting-- or not. I don't really care all that much. The show is entertaining, but not entertaining enough for me to actually by any of their records.   Word.   UPDATE: The satellite radio station has changed. We're now listening to the 70's station. This place is too predictable.

      I get a three day weekend this weekend. I don't have to work Monday because of Memorial Day.  It is confirmed:  The Day After Tomorrow  is   urlLink "a wreck" . For once,  urlLink CNN  and  urlLink Fox News  agree on something. I'm not sure if I want to watch it just yet. I think this one might be a renter.  Ever had a "case of the Mondays" on a Friday? That's what I have today (and it sucks). I'm looking forward to making a trip to  urlLink Best Buy  after work to make some purchases. Haven't decided yet if I want to buy  urlLink  The Office   on DVD or the new  urlLink Cardigans  CD,  urlLink  Long Gone Before Daylight  . I'm really torn, but what do you care? Yeah, that's what I thought.  Word.

      Well, Fantasia won (not a surprise)  urlLink American Idol . I expect to see great things from her.  I'm kind of annoyed, because, after work, I have to drive all the way out to  urlLink Butler  (that's where I go to school) to get my book receipt from their bookstore. Why? Because they gave me a wrong receipt and they have a dumb policy that requires me to have my book receipt so they can buy back my books at the end of the semester. Dumb? I think so.

      Wow. In stark contrast to yesterday, today is rather slow. Last night, my wife and I had take out from  urlLink P. F. Chang's . It cost us TWENTY BUCKS! And no leftovers! It was good nonetheless. I recommend the mongolian beef and sweet and sour chicken.  I'm looking forward to seeing the end of  urlLink American Idol  tonight. Who will win? Diana or Fantasia? I would hope that it woould be Fantasia. I guess it doesn't really matter if she does or not.  Word.

       The Day After Tomorrow  is no  Independence Day . Early buzz from  urlLink Fox News  says that Roland Emmerick's ( Independence Day ,  Godzilla ) new disaster flick is just that:  urlLink a disaster . If my assumptions are correct, this film will be just as good as  Volcano . If it's anything like   Volcano , the dialogue should go something like this:    Scientist:  New York is being flooded with water!  Disaster "Expert":  So you mean water is flooding New York City?  Scientist:  Yes.  Disaster "Expert":  Now I must brave the elements with my two friends here (who have no reason to go with me and who  will  die) and make a pointless journey to New York and save my son!       It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone if it's as bad as they say it is.  Godzilla  stunk.   urlLink Fox News  also reported that the new Harry Potter film  urlLink The Prisoner of Azkaban (out June 3rd) was pretty good. The guy who wrote the review is not a Harry Potter fan, so I can only take his review with a grain of salt. He said the opening sequence (Harry Potter inflates his aunt) was priceless.   There's  urlLink talk  according top the New York Post that the movie's producers might not hire the current Harry Potter actors back after the fourth film because they're getting too old.   I don't think hiring new, younger actors will do any good to the film franchise. In fact, I think it might ruin its current success. It's like making an Indiana Jones movie without Harrison Ford or making a Rocky film without Stallone. I guess only time will tell how any changes will affect the Harry Potter movie franchise. At this point, I don't see it as a good thing.   Controversial filmmaker,  urlLink Michael Moore  won the Cannes Film Festival's highest award, the Palm d'Or, for his "documentary"  Fahrenheit 9/11  (It should be taken into consideration that the festival is French).   This came as no surprise to me, but it is upsetting, because his documentaries are not really documentaries. Mr. Moore has such a way with words and footage that he can put a really good spin on the truth to the point that it becomes an outrageous lie. Check with   urlLink MooreWatch.com  or  urlLink MooreLies.com  for more developements. I'll rant MOORE about this later.  Word.

      It's only noon and I'm bored out of my mind. I'm not sure whether I should be happy or not. It's like when someone gives you a gift you know you'll never use. Because you're nice (and you didn't get a gift reciept), you'll keep it for a while. When it gets "lost" (sold) you know you're happy to be rid of it, but at the same time, you feel horrible when the person who gave you the gift asks you how you're enjoying it. That's kind of how I feel. I'm happy there's little-to-no work to do, but I feel horrible because I feel like should be doing something better with my time today. I can never win because I'm never satisfied.  If I feel like it, I'll post some more later.  Word.

      Once again, I'm bored at work. Obviously, it's of no consequence to you (lucky). I've decided to write some real CD reviews for you:   Guster  On Ice: Live In Portland, Maine :  Guster is an amazing band and it shows on their first live album,  Guster On Ice . If you're familiar with Guster, this CD is an easy listen. Not only is it an easy listen, it is also an amazing listen. The live versions of "Mona Lisa" and "Airport Songs" sport amazing electric guitar (and even a drum set on the latter), thus making the tunes heavier and even darker than the original recorded versions. Two crowd pleasing songs, "Come Downstairs And Say Hello" and "I Spy" have both been extended to feature instumental jams. To be funny, Ryan Miller substituted the lyrics of "I Spy" from "We went down to the May parade" to the more questionable "We went down to the gay parade."  The DVD is even more amazing than the CD. The DVD features a full-length concert (actually, the concert concert was filmed over two nights in Portland, so were getting a little bit of both nights here) and loads of extras. Guster was kind enough to include two of their three music videos ("Careful" & "Amsterdam"). Thankfully, they spared us from their first one, the infamous "Fa Fa" video. They've also included, my favorite of all the extras, the documentary "Dave Yonkman's Week With Guster." You get to meet Adam Gardner's parents, as well as the band itself. For any Guster fans who happen to be Barenaked Ladies fans, you'll be plased to know that the Barenaked Ladies make several cameo appearances.   Unlike Guster's previous (non-internet) releases, this one was slapped with the dreaded parental advisory sticker. It's not because of either the concert film or the CD. Both are rather clean for family listening. The documentary would probably get a PG-13 rating, as there are a few swearwords (not suitable for younger children). Ryan also drops the f-bomb a couple of times during "Come Downstairs Mulligan." There are no more swearwords on this disc than a Ben Folds album.  The only real downside to this album is its heavy price ($25-$30). It is recommended that the album should be ordered through  urlLink Guster.com  for $19.99 (This price does include shipping)! It's the best way to bypass "The Man."    Vertical Horizon  Between The Dim & The Dark :  To be completely honest, this album is nothing like I thought it would be: better than anything I've ever heard before. I was wrong and was let down because my expectations were so high. To be fair, this not a terrible album. It's very good. Unfortunately, it's not one that you'll love the first or second times you listen to it. An average person would probably toss it aside after the second track. After listening to it a few times, the album has really grown on me. A few of the songs will make it on some of my mix CDs.   The highlights of the album are "Young America," "Between The Dim & The Dark," "Daylight," and, the best track on the record, "Mexico."  Word.

      There is only one word I can use to describe  urlLink Guster 's Live CD+DVD,  urlLink Guster On Ice : Amazing.  I've never in my life spent $25 for a CD/DVD set, but I have to say it was worth it! Other  urlLink live recordings  of Guster pale in comparison to this album. This album makes them look great!  I love the live versions of "Happier" and "Careful". Of course, that's not to say the rest of the album doesn't rock ('cause it does)! I have never doubted myself for being a Guster fan.   I also recommend watching "Dave Yonkman's Week with Guster". Very informative, if not funny.  I'll be sure to post a better review later.  For anyone who's interested, Dashboard Confessional has made their new song   urlLink "Vindicted"  available for free on their website,  urlLink DashboardConfessional.com . This is the very one that is featured on the Spider-man 2 soundtrack. No strings attatched! Serious!  Word.

      I'm on break from school, thankfully. I just got my grades today. All A's. I was afraid that I was going to get a B in my public speaking class. I couldn't help but feel angry/humiliated that a B in my public speaking class was even a possibility. I've taken more difficult classes, you know. Because I earned such good grades, I'm going to celebrate by buying Guster's new live album,  urlLink Guster On Ice: Live in Portland, Maine !  It should be awesome. Also, I found out last week that  urlLink Guster  is going to be in Kansas City July 17th with  urlLink Ben Folds  &  urlLink Gavin DeGraw . This will be my 3rd attempt to go see Guster. They've played in Lawrence and Kansas City about two or three times since they released their album  urlLink Keep It Together  last year. I've tried to go every time, but I haven't been so lucky.   If I am successful and I can actually go, it will be my first time ever seeing Guster live and my third time seeing Ben Folds. Ben is awesome live! I saw him in Oklahoma at the OSU Orange Peel in September 2003 and in Kansas City at the Beaumont Club in March 2002. I hoping to actually meet him this time around. That would be awesome.  Also, I haven't forgotten about my list. It's still not done yet. I had finals, work, etc. Can you blame me?   Peace out.

      Last night I had a weird dream guest starring  urlLink Bernie Mac . It was a little bizarre. Cool, but bizarre.  I almost made a horrible mistake last night. Some friends of mine asked me if I wanted to go and see  urlLink  Spider-Man 2   last night at 12:01am. I did, but then I remembered what happened  urlLink the last time I went to the movies on a work night , I decided not to go. I didn't feel like I wanted to stay up until after 2 am just to get up at 6 am so I could be at work by 7 am work until 3:30 pm then go to school from 4 pm until 7 pm. Even worse, the class that I have today is my ethics class. I'd hate to go on less than 4 hours of sleep. I hate going to it even when I've had 6+ hours of sleep.  Also, part 2 of the unofficial  urlLink  Fahrenheit 9/11    urlLink transcript  is now available.

      Normally I wouldn't post two times in one day, but I read this on  urlLink AndrewSullivan.com  and thought it was hilarious (we're talking about  urlLink  Fahrenheit 9/11  , still):      FAHRENHEIT TEDIUM:  Well, I broke down and went to see the Michael Moore movie. I was expecting to be outraged, offended, maddened, etc etc.  No one told me I'd be bored*.  The devices were so tired, the analysis worthy of something by an intern in the Nation online, the sad attempts to blame everything on Bush so strained and over-wrought even the most credulous of conspiracists would have a hard time giving them the time of day. (read  urlLink the rest )   If you're interested, I found a transcript of the  urlLink first half  of the "documentary". The second half should be posted later today or tomorrow.   * I added bold to emphasize what I thought was funny.

      I know that it's stereotypical for men not to listen. My wife is constantly telling me she's told me things, but I don't know if she has because I may not have heard her say them. I know that she repeats things that she's already told me because she didn't remember whether she's told me or not. Most of the things she says that she's told me I don't remember hearing, but because I don't listen all the time I don't really know what she's told me and what she hasn't. For all I know she's already told me that she's going to play mind games and tell me that she going to tell me that she tells me things that she hasn't. The problem is I probably wasn't listening when she told me.  About something important:  I AM THE TACO EATTING CHAMPION!   Last night I managed to beat a co-worker of mine in a taco eatting contest. While he stopped at 12 tacos, I was able to eat 14. Thankfully, I didn't get as stuffed as I did the last time. The last time we had to stop at 12. My co-worker says he could have eatten more and that he  LET  me win. I guess we'll never know. We'll more than likely have a rematch because he can't just lose because he lost. I don't believe that he lost because he wanted to, he lost because he  COULDN'T  win. Next time I'll remember to bring the camera so you can see me stuffing my face with tacos.  Now about  urlLink Michael Moore  again...  Thanks to  urlLink MooreWatch.com  I've got some moore recommended articles for you to read about America's (apparently) favorite movie,   urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  . These are quite interesting:   urlLink Andrew Ferguson 's article at  urlLink Bloomberg.com    urlLink Mark Steyn 's article at  urlLink The Telegraph    urlLink Thomas Frank 's article as published in  urlLink Newsday   Then when your done, check out  urlLink this article  from  urlLink The Boston Herald . I liked this one, too.  I'm a fan of  urlLink MooreWatch.com . I was disappointed yesterday when I couldn't get on the web site. Apparently, the website was  urlLink attacked  by "Moore-ons" (Please be aware of possibly offensive language).

      What a weekend. It was my wife's birthday on Friday. I cooked her a nice dinner. It was fun. Now about something that's really irritating me right now...   urlLink Michael Moore 's film   urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11   opened up this weekend and ended up being #1 at the box office. I must personally thank the good people of the U.S. for blowing up Mr. Moore's ego. It's already larger that it should be. We gave him an Oscar. The French gave him the  urlLink Palm d'Or . He's had a few #1 bestsellers. Why? I don't know. The man is a liar and a hypocrite. As far as I'm concerned, he's no more of a liar than those who run the country. He accuses President Bush of lying to America, then he turns around and does the very same thing. He can put his spin on anything better than any politician. Sounds like he should run for office. If he's as persuasive as he says he is, he'd be a shoe-in.   Even Moore obnoxious, before the film's release, Mr. Moore supposedly had non-partisan fact checkers check and recheck all the facts shown and presented in the "documentary". Though he's presented a lot of facts in this movie, he's also left a ton of facts out (I suggest that you read  urlLink Christopher Hitchens ' article as posted on  urlLink The Slate . It's pretty interesting). Along with the fact checkers, he's hired a team of lawyers so that he can sue those who accuse him of lying, stretching the truth, etc. Does this not seem wrong to anyone else? If Michael Moore is so pro-free speech, why is he trying to shut up his critics by threatening them with law suits? If he has the right to his opinon, why is no one else entitled to theirs? It doesn't make any sense to me at all. Mr. Moore has even stated that this is an Op-Ed film with a clear agenda: to inspire people to vote Bush out of office. This movie is  HIS  opinion. It just seems funny that we're not supposed to dispute his opinion. We're just supposed to take it in and believe it. I thought he was against that? Hmmm...  If anyone who has seen this film has any sense of what the truth is, they'd realize that this film is not the whole truth.  Also, doesn't anyone else find it funny that this "man for the people" is donating a penny to the families of 9/11? For someone who hates it when people are exploited...

      It's nearly noon and I'm still half asleep. It's also my wife's birthday today. I'm still trying to decide what to do for her today. Thankfully I have all day to think about it.  I have to drop my car off at the dealership so they can look at car. The check engine light won't turn off. I don't really want to leave it there all day, but I guess I'll have to.

      Work has been relatively boring today with some excitement. I don't really care to go into the exciting part of work today because it only pertains to my job.  A guy at work and I have been discussing music for the last hour or so. It's been interesting.   I have to go to class tonight. I hope I get out early because I still have a few errands to run.

      I bought  urlLink Wilco 's  A Ghost Is Born  yesterday. I'm not sure what to think about it yet. I'll decided what I think when I listen to it all the way through.  Yesterday was full of surprises.   I found out that a friend of mine is getting married. Trouble is, the potential family really doesn't know what to think of her. Right now, it seems that their opinion borders more on dislike than anything else right now. This could be a potentially crazy situation. The family is in disbelief. The father doesn't even know yet. He doesn't really like her, so the potential groom is the one that's going to have to tell him. Even crazier, no one saw this coming  at all ! They didn't even act like they were really dating. I'm still in shock. They won't be getting married for a while, so we'll see what's going to happen. Will it  last ?  To be continued...   My car is driving me nuts. Last week I had them check out my car because my engine light came on. After doing a full diagnostic, they determined that the reason the light was on was because the gas cap wasn't on tight enough. They tightened it and the light went off. The problem was gone... or so I thought. On my way to class yesterday, I looked down and noticed that the engine light had come back on. When I got to my school's parking lot I took of my gas cap and put it back on and made sure it was on tight... several times. The light was still coming on when I turned on my car. I tried several times to tighten my gas cap but the light still wouldn't turn off. Maybe it's the gas I put in it? Who knows?  To be continued...

      I failed to report yesterday that my wife finally named her guinea pig: Pigwigeon. It's named after Ron's owl in the Harry Potter series.  I got my ethics quiz back from the other day. I didn't do as badly as I had anticipated. My grade still wasn't great, however. Thankfully the quiz we had yesterday on Utilitarianism was pretty easy. I'll be surprised if I missed any of the questions on it. He also included 10 points extra credit. I'm pleased that I at least had the chance to redeem myself.  Tomorrow we'll be having a quiz on Kantianism in my ethics class. We talked about Kantianism yesterday, but I was so tired that I just wrote down a few notes and page numbers. Everything else just kind of went in one ear and out the other. I'll be studying for a bit tonight.   If all goes to plan, I should be heading over to  urlLink Best Buy  after work to pick up  urlLink Wilco 's new album   A Ghost Is Born  (click link to preview) . I've heard that it's good (I haven't had the chance to preview it myself, unfortunately), but weird. I think I'll like it. This will be my first  urlLink Wilco  album. I only own certain songs that I bought off of  urlLink iTunes . I love those songs, so wy won't I enjoy this new album? We'll see...

      I left work three hours early the other day in order to take a nap. I wish I could say that my nap help me to recover from my late night, but it didn't. Though a few days have passed since my late night, I still haven't fully recovered. I'm still dead tired. Even worse, I have a quiz today in my ethics class. I just can't get a break.  Yesterday was father's day. I got my dad the soundtrack for  urlLink  A Mighty Wind  . He seemed to be happy about that. Unfortunately, my wife & I spent $20 on that CD. We had to buy it at  urlLink Borders  (which is always overpriced) because they didn't have the disc at  urlLink Best Buy . It should be against the law to sell CDs for more than $15.

      Wow, I'm even more tired today. I went to the drive-in last night with my wife and another couple. It seemed like a great idea yesterday. I didn't get to sleep until after 4 am. I had to be at work at 8:30 am. I should give myself a pat on the back.

      I'm tired today. I couldn't sleep last night. Also, there was a pretty loud thunder storm last night. Thankfully, I didn't have to be at work until 8 am this morning (I usually go to work at 7 am). The crappy thing about going to work so late is that I have to stay until 4:30 pm. I don't really want to be here at work today. I have to work tomorrow. I don't want to go. On the bright side, I should be able to get some studying done. It'll be slow tomorrow at work. I can't wait.

      I had to write a paper for my intro to short story class today about  urlLink "The Lottery"  by Shirley Jackson. If you haven't read it, you should. It's strange, but good (plus, you need to understand why I think I'm so clever). It start of my paper, I decided to use a lyric from Bob Dylan's "Rainy Day Women": "Everybody must get stoned." Read the story, then you'll understand why I chose that quote. I found it amusing anyway.  I was talking about the peacock this morning at work and somone else said they had seen it too. I'm glad someone else has seen it too. Now I can confirm that I'm not crazy.

      My car didn't blow up while I was driving it to school yesterday. I took it to the shop this morning. Everything is fine now. My car shouldn't blow up any time soon (if it's not provoked).   My day seemed pretty normal, but then something bizarre happened...   As I was drving home from running a few errands earlier today, I saw a peacock on the side of the road. Yes, I said a    PEACOCK   , as in the bird with the huge tail of feathers. I wish I had had my camera with me. It was weird. I guess someone lost it or it had escaped from someone's backyard. That would not surprise me, because I was driving in the nice part of town. Even so, you don't drive through the city of Wichita and expect to see a peacock outside of the zoo wandering along the side of the road like a lost dog. It just doesn't happen. I'm still trying to figure out why someone would have a peacock.    urlLink    Archive Photo: Sr. Benicio's peacock, not the one I saw today. Benicio was a guy I met in Brazil. His family had a peacock (Don't ask me why they had one, because I don't know).&nbsp; urlLink     For the few of you who do read this, I did stop my car and try to do something about it. I was going to try to return it to its owner(s) but when it saw me it ran into the bushes and trees on the side road and disappeared. I must have looked like an idiot searching for that elusive peacock. I didn't see it again. When I realized that I probably wouldn't find it, I got back into my car and drove away. The end.

      I'm driving to work this morning and I notice that my "check engine" light is on. After I got to work, I called the  urlLink Saturn  service department. I told him what the problem was and the guy on the phone asked me if I had checked my gas cap. I said no. He said "9 time out of 10 a loose gas cap is the reason that light comes on." I checked my gas cap. It wasn't loose. I unscrewed my gas cap anyway and tightened it again. It didn't change anything. It's just my luck that it wasn't the gas cap. I will be taking it into the shop tomorrow. Luckily my car is still under warranty so I won't have to pay for anything. They told me the problem isn't serious, so I'm hoping my car doesn't blow up while I'm driving to school.  I took my ethics quiz yesterday. I don't believe I did very well. I thought I was prepared... but I wasn't. I really loathe that class...  Ending on a good note, I got my  urlLink Gmail  account. It only cost me a Ben Folds Five single.

      I have an ethics quiz today (which I forgot that I had today). For some reason I was thinking that I didn't have my ethics class until tomorrow. I don't know why I was thinking that! I'm freaking out about my quiz for some reason. I'm sure everything will be okay in the end.  I'm pretty excited that I will (if all goes according to plan) get a  urlLink Gmail  account (thanks to  urlLink GmailSwap.com ).  urlLink Gmail  is an awesome free service that offers 1gig of space. It is currently by invitation only. Thanks to  urlLink GmailSwap.com , you can offer stuff (or to do stuff) for people looking to give away their invitations. I'm offering someone a Ben Folds Five single.  My wife and I bought a guinea for my wife's birthday (which isn't unitl the end of the month, by the way). I've never had a guinea pig. She's pretty fun and has crazy fur. My wife hasn't named her yet.   Until later.

      We were supposed to have had a moment of silence for Ronald Reagan at work today, but that didn't happen (by accident). The moment of silence was supposed to be at 10:30am cst and nobody told us. Calls stopped coming in at about 10:30am and everyone was confused. Was there a problem? No one knew. It wasn't until 10:37am that we received an e-mail telling us about the moment of silence.   Apparently, the person who sent out the e-mail was told that the moment was supposed to be at 11:30am. She didn't realize that whoever sent the e-mail meant eastern standard time, not central.   "Stoß mich baby noch ein mal!"

      What was my problem yesterday? I have no idea...  (I really wonder if anyone actually reads this blog. Probably not. This is more for myself anyway.)  I went to my short story class yesterday. It was pretty cool. The class gets to choose its own short stories to read. I have to pick 2. I haven't decided what we'll read yet. I need to find something cool. I'm looking forward to tomorrow's class, because we'll be watching Tim Burton's  Big Fish .  I read the assignment for my ethics class today: I have no idea what I read. I didn't understand any of it. Hopefully the teacher will be able to interpret it. From what I hear, our professor hates the book, so his interpretation should be interesting.

      Our team at work was awarded  Team of the Month . Awesome. We now get to park in the choice parking spots. Other than that, work has been, well, work.  My summer semester of school began yesterday. I get to take eight weeks of ethics and intro to short story. If all goes according to plan, I'll be a sophomore by the end of the summer. I'm very excited about that.  The downside to all of this is that I have to be at work by 7am everyday (except Friday). I'll be very tired by the end of the week. Who am I kidding? I'm very tired now!  Not about school, but about church. On Sunday, someone got up and announced to the congregation that his wife has lung cancer. He was very casual about it. He shared with everyone how he was dealing with it (I would hope that he discussed this with his wife first!). It didn't really add anything to the meeting. I'm not trying to be insensitive or anything by saying this, but I am in no way close to this family and I felt that it was inappropriate for him to do that.   People, sometimes, tend to tell you too much information. This is especially true at church where everyone is considered family. That doesn't mean you should share information that's meant for your family and close friends. This is a pet peeve of mine. A couple weeks ago, someone told me that they had been having a hard time that week and had tried to kill themselves. Wow. Did I really need to know that? I had just barely met that person. Maybe I needed to know about someone's ongoing family feud, their dead mother and why they don't have anything nice (except their Palm Pilot)? Or maybe I needed to know that someone else is going to have a vasectomy? I think people, before they speak, need to, first, try and determine if they know me well, then determine what I should know (if I should be told anything). Sometimes, they should just keep certain things to themselves.  Based on experience, some people (especially those at church) don't know how to handle tragic news. A while ago, a missionary from another ward (congregation) passed away while on his mission. This is the way it was announced (I kid you not): "...We will be playing volleyball this Friday night at 7:00pm... by the way [John Doe] from the [other ward] died on his mission. We'll be having a ward activity next Saturday..." A friend of ours, who was close to the young man who had passed away, had somehow not heard the news directly from anyone. She left the meeting in tears.   Word.

      I purchased  urlLink The Cardigans ' most recent album  urlLink  Long Gone Before Daylight   on Friday and I saw  urlLink  Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban   on Saturday.   I highly recommend  urlLink  Long Gone Before Daylight  . It is an amazing album (much better than the last two,  urlLink  First Band on the Moon   and  urlLink  Gran Turismo  ). If you decide not to buy the whole album (which comes with a bonus DVD, by the way) and go the  urlLink iTunes  route, I highly recommend the songs "Communication," "Live & Learn," "For What It's Worth," and "You're The Storm." Honestly, I recommend buying the whole album. It's worth it.  I thought that  urlLink  Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban   was the best Harry Potter movie thus far. I really enjoyed the direction of Alfonso Cuaron, though I wish he didn't have to condense certain things and leave out others. Cedric and Cho were not introduced in this film (as they should have been), but I'm sure they will be in the next film as they play very important parts in the book. In spite of that, I really enjoyed the film. It's too bad that Alfonso is not going to be directing the next film.   Word.

      I watched the last two episodes of  urlLink  The Office   yesterday. I was frustrated by the because there was no closure. Everything was left unresolved. I have to wait until October (the 25th to be exact) when the Christmas specials are released on DVD to see the end of  urlLink  The Office  .  Tomorrow I'm going to see the new Harry Potter movie   Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban  . I've been reading about how great it is. I hope it's not a let down.   In other  Harry Potter   news, I stumbled upon J. K. Rowling's  web site . It's got a lot of cool Harry Potter updates on it.   As reported by CNN, John Kerry made  urlLink a visit  to the Vietnam memorial on Memorial Day.  In more important news...  I was surprised to learn about what  urlLink really happened  on Memorial Day when John Kerry went to give a speech for a bunch of school age children at the Vietnam Memorial in D.C.. The whole story, to my dismay, was not aggresively reported by the media as it should have been.   To summarize the story, John Kerry became upset when Ted Sampley, a Vietnam veteran and head of the  urlLink Vietnam Veteran's Against John Kerry , was heckling the Massachusetts senator as he was speaking to some school children. Rather than handle the situation like an adult, he gave the middle finger to the vet. If you don't believe it, you can also check out the report in  urlLink The Washington Times . There are also confirmed news sources that were  urlLink present .  To be fair, though, you can check out the history of Ted Sampely as viewed by some Kerry supporters  urlLink here .  Another surprising article that I read was also about Kerry, but it was also about his   urlLink connection to 9/11 . This is very plausible. Afterall, he is the senator of Massachusetts.   I'm not really surprised that none of this was reported by any of the larger news outlets. I'm disappointed, really.

      I think it's going to be a while before I can sit down and watch the first season of   urlLink  The Office   again. I sat down and watched the first season for the third time yesterday. I still think it's very good, but I'm subconsciously memorizing all the words. That doesn't make too much sense, because I am very aware that I am memorizing all the words.  I am very, very tired today. It's only 9 a.m. and I'm bored out of my mind. Work isn't very exciting.   I bought the  urlLink  Shrek 2   soundtrack and  urlLink Ryan Adams'   Love Is Hell  the other day. Both are very good. I especially like his version of Oasis' "Wonderwall". It's probably even better than the original.  I was reading the Wichita Eagle's  urlLink opinion line  and became annoyed. Why? Let me quote it for you:  "It's official: Shrek is more popular than Jesus Christ."  I want to make it clear that I hate the opinion line. It is the most useless and irritating feature in the  urlLink Wichita Eagle . It's function is to allow people to get their opinions published in the paper. Unfortunately, hardly any of the opinions that get published are rational or well thought out. Most of the opinions are ignorant or, to be blunt, stupid.   Now about the above opinion: obviously this reader is upset that  urlLink  Shrek 2   is making more money than Mel Gibson's   urlLink The Passion of The Christ  . I don't think the remiter of this opinion took much time to try to understand why that might be.   At the time   urlLink The Passion   was released, someone said that they saw it "being a devout Christian." That really annoyed me. Why? Because I am a devout Christian and I don't think I'm less of one just because I didn't see Gibson's film adaption of Christ's crucifixion. I am literate (that's not why I didn't see the film) and I can read it for myself in The Bible.   I saw  urlLink  Shrek 2  , but not   urlLink The Passion  . Just because I saw  urlLink  Shrek 2   and I didn't see   urlLink The Passion   doesn't mean I worship Shrek. He didn't pay for my sins.  It should be noted that the  urlLink  Shrek   movie was made for a much broader audience. It's movie for everyone. Though Christ's love is for everyone, I'm sure the film is not. It's bloody violent and deep. For a powerful movie that is short, moving and to the point, watch  urlLink  The Lamb of God  . It is amazing and, more importantly, truly family friendly.  Word.

      It 's official! The world's greatest rapper,  urlLink Ma$e  is  urlLink back ! My world was left pretty cold when he left the rap industry to become a preacher. I'm glad that I can get on with my life now. Whatever.    ***  urlLink  SUMMERLAND   SPOILERS BELOW ***    My wife and I sat down last night and watched a new show on  urlLink The WB  called  urlLink  Summerland  . My verdict? Mediocre at best. Plot: Kids from Kansas lose their parents in a flooding accident while trying to save people who live in "the valley". I live in Kansas and, last time I checked, there are no real valleys. Apparently, the "experts"   urlLink agree . Regardless, the parents die and they die as heroes.  My question: why do the kids have to be from Kansas? Why not Nebraska or Oklahoma? I can only assess that the reason they are from Kansas is because the creators of the show believe Kansas to be a stark contrast to California. Or maybe it's because, stereotypically, Kansans live in the world, but they don't have a clue about it. That's unfair and untrue.  The children's parents willed the kids out to their fashion designer aunt rather than to their uncle. The aunt lives in California near the beach with three other people (2 men, 1 woman). The aunt is obviously single and her life is unstable. She just quit her job and was about leave for Paris with her best friend when she heard the tragic news of her sister's death. She doesn't understand why she was chosen to have custody of her sister's children (see plot for  urlLink  Raising Helen  ).  The three kids, the 16 year-old boy, 13 year-old girl and 9(?) year-old boy are all having a hard time dealing with their parent's death. The oldest boy, with some coersion and a hot female instructor, takes up surfing. Inevitably, the kid developes a crush on her and when he sees her with another guy (one of his aunt's housemates) he goes into a drunken stupor. I didn't quite understand this, considering the values his parents supposedly instilled in him(Then again, he was making out with some girl pretty heavily in his room earlier in the episode and his mom didn't even notice). Obviously, we can see that problems are begining to develope.  The girl is a brat from the begining and she stays as such until the end of the episode when she (unrealistically) decides to stop being one. The youngest child spends most of the episode trying to commit suicide, so he can give himself to his deceased mother for her birthday. The kid doesn't understand the whole death thing and no one bothered to explain it to him (until the end, that is).    I wouldn't really recommend this show to anyone. The writing is not very good, the acting is questionable and the story is cliche. I wouldn't consider this one a hit and it will be lucky if it can survive until the next month. I know I'm already saying goodbye to it.  Previews for upcoming episodes show situations that are reminicent of  urlLink  The OC  . That bothers me. I like  urlLink  The OC  , but it's the fact they're blatantly copying the show in order to emulate its success. There is a lack of originality on television.  Really what it boils down to is that I need to quit watching T.V. and get a real life. Not like this  urlLink one .  Word.

      I hate  urlLink Rod Stewart . Why do people think he can sing? He can't. Luckily, I don't hate all things from the United Kingdom (Rod is Scottish). I like  urlLink Monty Python . I especially like  urlLink  The Office  . Very funny. I not only like it because it's British, but because I work in an office.  I had a really good Memorial Day. I went to a picnic, ran errands, painted a wall in our room, went to Wal-mart a few times, watched   urlLink  The Office  , visited my wife's grandmother, cleaned the apartment and ate pizza.   Like I said, we visited my wife's grandmother yesterday. I didn't really want to, because I knew she'd find something for me to do. That's what she does. If you visit her, she finds a chore for you to do.  Because we were in the area, we went and visited my wife's grandmother. We were there for about 10 minutes then she said, "I know what you can do for me..." as if she had been searching for chores that she wanted done. The special chore that she found for me to do was to put a table crafts together for her. Luckily for us, the table was in the trunk of her friend's car and her friend was nowhere to be found. Because I'm nice, I told her I'd put it together for her today after work.   I didn't go straight over to her house after work. I was exhausted and stressed from work today. I wanted to let mullet man (that's my mother in-law's cousin) put it together, but his elbow is broken and I wasn't going to go back on my word.  I went over to her apartment this evening and put the table together. It was too exciting. I had all the parts stewn out all over the living room floor. She sat and watched me. I couldn't help but feel like someone had conned her into buying this table. I think there's a group of men who meet in a secret room somewhere who invent crappy products for the elderly. To make the buyer feel patriotic, they slap an American flag on the box, call their company, for example, AmeriCo, but the product is made in China. Sad.  Anyway, I put the table together in about 30 minutes. She let me take the box back to my place so I could throw it in my apartment complex's dumpster.   I really like my wife's grandmother. She is really nice, seriously. I'm not being sarcastic. Really.  Word.

      The semester is almost over with! I've one exam to take today. I still have three papers to write (all must be over 3 pages). I've been trying to sit down and write them, but it's been practically impossible. I need to stop procrastinating (cable TV is going to lead to my downfall). I'm not trying to justify myself, but it's been pretty hard to write my papers because I've been so exhausted after work and school. I'm going to write my ethics paper tonight and then we'll go from there.

      My wife bought a   People   Magazine the other day and I found the funniest interview ever with  urlLink Clay Aiken . This is the part that I thought was the funniest (emphasis added):    What can't you do?  I'm not a Justin Timberlake. I'm not a dancer. I'm not a really hip-hop-type person.   I don't want to sing about things that I feel are inappropriate. I'm not going to sing about sex and drugs because I don't feel that's what my responsability is.   (as published in the July 26th issue of  urlLink  People  )  Has he not read the lyrics to his hit "Invisible"?  Here's a refresher:  What are you doing tonight / I wish I could be a fly on your wall / Are you really alone / Still in your dreams / Why can't I bring you into my life / What would it take to make you see that I'm alive  [Chorus ]  If I was invisible/ Then I could just watch you in your room / If I was invisible / I'd make you mine tonight / If hearts were unbreakable / Then I can just tell you where I stand / I would be the smartest man / If I was invisible / (Wait..I already am)  I saw your face in the crowd / I called out your name / You don't hear a sound / I keep tracing your steps / Each move that you make / Wish I could be what goes through your mind / Wish you could touch me with the colors of your life  [Repeat Chorus ]   So, it's all right to sing about stalking?  That's  not inappropriate? Looks like Mr. Aiken definitely follows a different set of morals. Creepy...

          urlLink    Ticket Stub.  urlLink     &nbsp; Alright. I saw  urlLink Ben Folds  and  urlLink Guster  play last night at the  urlLink City Market  in Kansas City, MO. It was amazing. I, unfortunately, did not get to meet  urlLink Ben  or  urlLink Guster  due to time constraints. The show started late (after 8:00pm) and ended late (11:30pm-ish). We had to leave almost immediately after the show. We drove back to Wichita and got home at about 3:00am.   The venue wasn't great and I couldn't take any good pictures (so I didn't) because I was stuck in the back. I had a perfect view of the stage, but could hardly tell who was on it. There was no way to get any closer. I had a great time regardless.  The highlights of the show were when  urlLink Guster  played "Fair" ( Ryan  sang the second verse) and "Not the Same" with  urlLink Ben  and when  urlLink Ben  introduced  Brian  from  urlLink Guster  as  urlLink Rufus Wainwright  then they duetted on a cover of Wham's "Careless Whisper."&nbsp;Oh, and I wasn't impressed with  urlLink Gavin Degraw  at all. &nbsp; Here's the setlist: &nbsp;  Ben: &nbsp; Fred Jones Pt. 2 / Zak &amp; Sara / All You Can Eat / Late / Careless Whisper with "Rufus Wainwright" (Brian from Guster) / Philosophy / Uncle Walter / Army / Selfless, Cold &amp; Composed / The Luckiest / Rockin the Suburbs ("Just like Guster's gonna do...") / Steven's Last Night In Town (with drum war) / Fair (with Guster) / Not the Same (with Guster)    Guster:  (Not in order yet) Rock this B**** / Happier / Amsterdam / Demons / Careful /  I Spy / Airport Song / Barrel of a Gun / Come Downstairs and Say Hello / Ramona / Homecoming King ("Back in Kansas City") / Fa Fa    /// Encore with Ben Folds ///   K.C. Masterpiece / Backyard / Boy with the Arab Strap / All the Way Up to Heaven

      My short story teacher asked me a very funny question yesterday. Before I tell you the question, I must preface it with a few pieces of vital information (otherwise, you won't get the humor of the situation): First of all, I am a  Mormon . Second of all,  Mormons  no longer practice polygamy (we don't have more than one wife). Third of all, my wife's parents divorced and my father-in-law remarried, therefore, I have two mother-in-laws.    Mormons  came up in my short story class one day. It told everyone I was one. I told them we don't practice polygamy anymore. Then, on a separate day, I made mention of my two mother-in-laws. I didn't even think to explain it. This, apparently, confused my teacher.    She asked me to stay after class yesterday just so she could ask me a question. She asked me: "I'm going to ask you a question that might be inappropriate, so you don't have to answer it if you don't want to. What I would like to know is, how do you have two mother-in-laws?" Instantly, I knew what she was thinking. I explained to her about my wife's parents. She told me that she just wanted to make sure and that she was just being curious. My teacher knew I was devoted to my wife, but when I mentioned that I had two mother-in-laws, it threw her for a loop. This was a question that has been bothering her for over a month. We both had a good laugh.

      I just barely finished my paper that's due for my short story class this afternoon as few minutes ago.  I'm having a hard time resisting the temptation to buy Ben Folds' latest EP,   Super D  . It's on sale for pre-order at  urlLink www.attackedbyplastic.com . The first 500 ordered will be autographed. Why am I not ordering it? Because I promised my wife that I wouldn't. I wish I hadn't now. I'll be over it tomorrow. I wanted to complete my set (I have  Speed Graphic  and  Sunny 16  autographed), but I won't now. That sucks.    UPDATE: The autographed copies of   Super D   are out.

      About bad grammar (you didn't think I'd leave this one alone, did you? If you did, then you don't know me very well):  I got an e-mail at work that read as follows:    Per D: Her and R have switched lunch times today.    After reading the e-mail I said aloud "[so & so] needs to learn to use good grammar. Bad grammar irritates me!" Then a co-worker (who is always irritated at me for one reason or another) turned around to say (unintentionally using bad grammar): "Not nobody doesn't use good grammar like Nathaniel Goold!"  That cracked me up. Though that was funny, bad grammar is nothing to laugh at. Seriously.

      Sometimes I wish I didn't have to deal with people. I know that doesn't sound like a very Christian thing to say, but it's true. I just get tired of people. I'm sure they get tired of me.   Also, bad grammar irritates the crap out of me.

      I'm feeling bored today, yet I'm managing to keep myself busy. I have a few papers to write for my short stoy and ethics classes. I need to get them done between now and Friday night if I want a completely stress-free weekend. I won't be able to work on my homework at all on Saturday because I'll be going to see  urlLink Guster  and  urlLink Ben Folds  in Kansas City that day. I'm pumped.  I am very interested in what is happening in the music side of the entertainment industry and in what is going on politically here in the United States. This kind of irritates my wife, because she does really care about that stuff. For me, it's equally irritating when I have to try and justify why I'm interested in the things I'm interested in. I'm pretty passionate when it comes to music and certain things about politics. I don't know why. I just am.

      I'm surprised I didn't find time to post yesterday. It was super busy at work and I failed to get on the internet at home.   It looks like there's some guy trying to take on  urlLink Fox News  with a new movie called " Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism ". The  Associated Press  ran a  urlLink story  about it and it appeared in numerous papers and web sites ( urlLink Fox News  included) across the country. Along with the story about " urlLink Outfoxed " they also ran a  urlLink rebuttal .  This is going to get interesting. It should be noted that " urlLink Outfoxed 's" major sponsor just so happens to be the anti-Bush group,  urlLink MoveOn.org . I'm not sure exactly what is going on here, but it seems that we have a lot of upset liberals angry at the fact that there is someone in the media world that refuses to be like them. Most other media channels (*cough*  urlLink CNN  *cough*) have such a liberal slant that it's hard to tell what exactly is going on.   They're either upset that  urlLink Fox News  is going against the grain or that because they are more conservative than the other sources (remember, they are the fair ones) they are not really as fair or as balanced as they claim. I haven't seen any pro-Bush ads on  urlLink Fox News . I've seen plenty of  urlLink MoveOn.org 's ads on  urlLink CNN , though. Which news channel being biased again?

      I got soaked this morning on my way to the car. I didn't realize that was to be a foreshadowing of my day. The first thing I did this morning was purchase tickets to the concert for next weekend. When I went to break, I got a voicemail from my wife this morning saying that I got shorted on my paycheck. I didn't think she was right. To my dismay, she was right and it was my fault. When I had filled out my time sheet last week, I overlooked one day on my time card. In other words, I did not get paid for one day. My supervisor didn't catch my mistake either. It was all my fault, so I was pretty ticked at myself. I'll get paid for it, but I'm not sure when. The day is looking up, though.

      It's been a slow, slow, slow afternoon. It's days like this that make me  want  to go to school. I am counting down the weeks until this (the summer) semester ends (there's only three more weeks left). I'm looking forward to tomorrow because it's pay day  AND  I should be getting my student loan check in the mail (Too bad all the money coming in had already been spent). I'm excited about it anyway.  My wife and I are going with another couple to some musical (for free) called "Me & My Girl" which is being performed by Music Theatre of Wichita. I don't know anything about it. How cares? I'm not paying for it anyway. I just hope it's decent.  I've got some homework to do this weekend. I'm not looking forward to it, but it needs to be done.    Oh yeah, for those of you who are (not) interested about my phone, I'm not getting a new one until Monday or thereabout. Thankfully, they'll be able to transfer my phonebook from one phone to another.

      I get to go to the Sprint Store tonight after class because my phone's LCD display is no longer functioning. It's driving me nuts. Luckily the phone is not yet a year old and is still under warranty. I hope I can somehow transfer my phone book to another phone (if I need one) because I don't want to have to start over.  I read the following in  urlLink Guster 's  urlLink Road Journal  and I thought it was hilarious. Right now they are on tour with  urlLink Rufus Wainwright  and  urlLink Ben Folds  (I will be seeing them minus  urlLink Rufus  plus  urlLink Gavin Degraw  in Kansas City next week).      Transcription of a conversation between Brian Rosenworcel and Rufus Wainwright backstage in Gilford NH on July 1st:     RW:  Did you see that there's a chiropractor here?  BR:  Yeah, I think I'll skip it. Did you set that up?  RW:  I don't think so. I think she's from the venue. Did you know chiropractics are illegal in France?   BR:  No .... what else is illegal in France?   RW:  I don't know. Murder?

      Well,  urlLink John Kerry  picked his  urlLink running mate . I hope John Edwards is ready. What a team.  It's been a slow day today. It feels like I've been at work for several decades now. After work, I'll be going to school. After losing 8 hours of my life at work, I'll get to lose another 3 hours of my life at school. Wow.

      I had a nice, relaxing weekend. I didn't touch my homework at all. We didn't shoot any fireworks off last night. We shot off fireworks on the 3rd, however. It was fun.  I have to work today. I don't know why. Everyone is closed today in observance of the 4th of July. I also have to go to school today even though every college (except for the one I attend) in town is closed. What are the odds?  Work is super slow today. We have less people working today than we normally do and we're still over staffed. I've had two phone calls since 7:00 am this morning. It is now 10 am. As a result, I've been reading a lot of articles on the internet this morning.  I found this really cool article about   urlLink The 59 Deceits of  Fahrenheit 9/11  . Also I found that there's a new book out about  urlLink Michael Moore  called  urlLink "Michael Moore is a Big, Fat, Stupid White Man" . It's allegedly being buried in America's favorite book stores (*cough*  urlLink Barnes & Noble  *cough*). Read about it   urlLink here .  Anyone catch the news on Tuesday? There wasn't a lot of emphasis put on the whole transfer of power in Iraq. Remember when missiles were fired at the Sheraton Hotel in Baghdad the other day? The headline read:      urlLink  EXPLOSIONS ROCK CENTRAL BAGHDAD      (only  one  person injured)    That's right, only   ONE   person was injured in the attack. No casualties. The headline made it sound like there was some real action going on. Upon reading the article, I discovered that it was about a few idiot terrorists. These guys were amatures. This is my favorite part of the  urlLink article  (as reported by  urlLink The Associated Press :    A U.S. soldier at the scene said assailants fired rockets from a homemade launcher in the back of the van. Some of the rockets caught fire before they could be launched, he said, setting the van ablaze.  "After the incident, the car exploded," said an Iraqi police captain who spoke on condition of anonymity.  ...Earlier, insurgents using rockets also attacked the area near Marjam Hotel, which is also used by Westerners. One rocket struck a statue in nearby Wathik Square and another landed near the Indonesian Embassy, but did not explode, police said.    If I was only reading the headline, I would have thought something important had taken place. In reality, the situation was almost laughable, except for the poor guy whose leg was smashed during the incident.   The news only tells America about the terrible things that happen. Even worse, some of the things they broadcast aren't even that significant. Talk about media bias...

      I can't wait to go home. The work day always seems longer than it is. Unfortunately for me, though I will not be working at my job this weekend, I still have a lot of work to do at home. Most of my work stems from my ethics class. Bah! I have a ton of stuff to read and a six page paper to write, a couple of chapters to read in my more-boring-than-dirt ethics book, and a quiz to study for. I have a paper to write for my short story class, as well. Thankfully, that paper will be much easier to write. On top of my school work, there are a few things (dishes, laundry) I need to do around the apartment. Yay Fridays!

      I took a gamble yesterday and left my ethics class 2 hours early. There should be an extra credit question on the quiz that partains to what was discussed in class yesterday. I might not be able to answer it now, because I left early. We had a substitute and I didn't feel like staying the whole time. I told the substitute that I had to leave early. I didn't tell her that I'd go crazy if I didn't. The reason I had to leave early was to go get tickets for  urlLink  Spider-Man 2   (which was amazing, by the way. Better than the original) and to go eat dinner at my parent's house. It was my younger brother's 22nd birthday. All my brothers and sisters were there. It was the first time all five of us had been in the same room together for quite a while. It was fun.

      I am soooo tired today. I don't have to work tomorrow, thankfully. I'll still have to get up early, though. I'm taking my wife to the airport in the morning at the crack of dawn. Man, that's going to suck. I'll have the apartment to myself for a whole five days. That'll be weird.
