        urlLink Gmail Filter Tips : "I haven't seen anyone cover some of the undocumented filters trick you can do with Gmail. Gmail doesn't even have a 'how to' on filters yet. The reason they don't have a 'how to' is because it's pretty dang simple (oh yea, and its in beta still). You can setup a filter to automatically do actions on an e-mail such as: Skip the Inbox (Archive it), Star it, Apply a label, or Move it to the Trash. These filters can be based upon a combination of: From, To, Subject, Has the words, Doesn't have the words, and Has attachment. I haven't pushed the limited, but from this tricks 'n' tidbits page I see that Gmail currently has a limit of 20 filters. So I offer the follow tip for creating less filters: Use '|' (OR) and '*' (wildcard) characters to catch multiple e-mail addresses and apply a general filter.   Example 1:  Starring and Labeling e-mails from specified buddies of mine. I setup a label called 'Buddies'. Then I go and create a new filter. The 'From' field can contain multiple e-mail addresses, but not a comma delimited list like one might first expect. You need to separate each e-mail address with a '|' (pipe) which means 'OR'.   From: joe.shmoe@hotmail.com|Bob.Dole|geek@foo.com   The above example will catch e-mail from either joe.shmoe@hotmail.com, Bob.Dole@gmail.com (notice in my filter I didn't specify '@gmail.com', this is because you don't need the domain when referencing other Gmail users - same for when composing an e-mail), or geek@foo.com.   Click 'Next Step'...   Then just select the "Star it" option, and select the "Buddies" label. Now all new messages from these three friends will be starred and labeled automatically.   Example 2:  Very similar to example 1 but now using "*" wildcards. This filter catches all e-mail from vendors I frequently make on-line purchases with. Some vendors like Amazon.com will use multiple e-mail addresses when I make a single purchase - one when I first place my order and then another when my items ship.   First I create a filter "On-line Shopping". Then I go and create new filter with the following...   From: *@amazon.com|*@paypal.com|*@ebay.com|*@thinkgeek.com   The above covers a few places that I purchase items from - your list of course will vary, but you get the idea. And depending upon how avid of an eBay seller/buying you are - you may want a separate label.   Personally, I "Star it" and apply the "On-line Shopping" label to this filter as well. Then, when an order arrives and the transaction is complete, I manually unstar and "Archive" the e-mail, and it will always be available by the label search.So, I hope I was able to open a few eyes to the possibilities of using filters. Now... to test Regular Expressions in filters???

        urlLink Wi-Fi finds the way when GPS can't : "In the concrete canyons of city centres, GPS satellite positioning systems often fail because high buildings block the signals they rely on. But an unlikely back-up for GPS is emerging: Wi-Fi.  A Wi-Fi based positioning system developed in the US and the UK works best where GPS fails: in cities and inside cavernous complexes like shopping malls. And because cheap Wi-Fi technology is already appearing on a raft of gadgets like PDAs, cellphones and laptops faster than more expensive GPS receivers are, the developers predict that Wi-Fi could become central to new location-based applications. They say emergency services in particular could find the system an essential back-up. Wi-Fi allows people to connect devices wirelessly to the internet. Base stations are springing up in coffee bars, libraries, universities, airports, phone booths and other public places. Each base station broadcasts a radio signal to announce its presence to devices within a range of around 100 metres. This signal incorporates a unique network address code that identifies the base station. Anthony LaMarca of the University of Washington in Seattle, and colleagues at Intel's research labs in both the US and the UK, have developed software that constantly records the radio signal strengths from nearby base stations.  It can identify the origin of the signal from a database giving the location of 26,000 Wi-Fi base stations in the US and the UK. Using the signal strength from at least three base stations, it can then triangulate the user's location. 'This is a poor man's GPS,' says team member Bill Schilit of Intel Research in Santa Clara, California. "
