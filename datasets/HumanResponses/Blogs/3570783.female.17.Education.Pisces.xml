      The way I woke up today should've told me that it wasn't going to be the best day.  I was dreaming, which mean I was in my deepest part of my sleep, and my dad calls my freakin cell phone at 7:30 looking for my mom.  I was all disoriented and started running into things looking for her.  So after he realized that she was out to coffee with the ladies, I turned on the computer do read some journals.  Bad idea.  I read Nate's first.  I think I had something to do with the shit he's feeling right now.  Two days ago, everything was perfect.  But now...I feel like I'm messing up with everything I do.  Nate, please to feel that way.  I'm sure me being so distant last night didn't add or make you feel like I truly care about you.  Oi.  I'm going to go drown in the shower

       Is This the End of the World As We Know It?     My life has been a comedy plagued by tragedies.  I could give you a whole outline, but that would be a novella, so that wouldn't help in the least.  A year and a half ago, I fell down hard, and refused to get up.  I loved the idea of power but I was afraid to have it.  I was drowning in a pool of water, and every time I got my head above water, I was pushed back under.  For a year and a half, I was slowly sinking to the bottom, light around me was caving in, and I was left with eternal darkness.  I was brought back to life shortly after Christmas this year, when I was confronted about my problems.  The person gave me an ultimatum; I change, or be left drowning.  I decided to change, hoping that it would be for the best.       Two months later, I came out a new person.  I was hardly recognizable to my friends and myself.  I had more confidence, that I thought would help me in life, but to every cloud there is silver lining.  With the confidence came better grades and the ease to express myself more freely.  I said things that I was too timid to say in the previous months.  I came out of my shell, and light came pouring down on me.  To make sure that I didn't go back into the darkness ever again, I started running.  I ran from every problem, not getting too involved.  I asked questions and I got answers, I might not have liked the answers, but I tried not to let them get me down.  To ensure that I would be happy, I got rid of my source of darkness.  I lifted the heavy blanket off me and tossed it aside.  I was almost completely back to normal...well...as normal as I got, but there was still a void.  Some part of me was stuck at an intersection and the light blared red.  I couldn't go anywhere, I couldn't do anything.  And I still have that void now.  It was the only part of me that refused to change and I find myself resorting to thoughts and ideas of my past that I thought I'd never return to again...    I Want Love   I can't love, shot full of holes Don't feel nothing, I just feel cold Don't feel nothing, just old scars Toughening up around my heart  But I want love, just a different kind I want love, won't break me down Won't brick me up, won't fence me in I want a love that don't mean a thing That's the love I want, I want love  I want love on my own terms After everything I've ever learned Me, I carry too much baggage Oh man I've seen so much traffic    Asleep   Sing me to sleep Sing me to sleep I'm tired and I I want to go to bed Sing me to sleep Sing me to sleep And then leave me alone Don't try to wake me in the morning 'Cause I will be gone Don't feel bad for me I want you to know Deep in the cell of my heart I will feel so glad to go    Original Sin   Oh it's carnival night and their string the lights around you. Hanging paper angles Painting little devils on the roof. Oh the furnice wind Is a flickering of wings about your face In a clound of insense  Yeah it smells like heaven in this place.  I can't eat Can't sleep Still I hunger for you when you look at me That face Those eyes Are the sinful pleasures deep inside  Tell me how you know how The ways and means of getting in Underneath my skin Oh you were always my Original Sin Tell me why I shutter inside Everytime you begin these dangerous games Oh you were always my Orginianl Sin

      It's 8:00 AM.  I've been up for an hour studying latin.  Fun times.  Two more exams left then I'm free for the whole summer.  Well, actually no, not exactly.  I'm going to be a slave to the piano for the whole summer.  I just got my music for camp yesterday, I must of really impressed them with my audition because they want me to learn 40 pages of music between now and sometime before the 28th.  So I have to work on that and my 34 page solo.  Plus, I start babysitting/piano lessons the week after I come back from camp, so it will be interesting.    Today...hmm...Taking my Latin and English final.  I don't have to worry about English, it's Dowling, but latin......GOD.  I think Nate would be better on the test than I would.  Then after my exams, I going to go pick Sarah up and we are going to go shopping quickly for a few things, then off to the movies to see Mean Girls.  Then home again, for a bit, then off to hang out with Nate and other people.  AND...I get to be up early tomorrow.  Lucky me.  I have a lesson at 10 AM!  WAHOO.  Sorry, I'm running off a bowl and a half of Lucky Charms and I'm about to go get coffee.  I'm going to be such a tweak during latin.  Ah well.  Atleast Lauren will have some fun.  -Cally

      Yeah, hmm... my first update.  Well I've had many of these journals, just o n different sites.  Never really kept up with them much, I don't know why, I probably just got bored knowing me.  So, anyway.  School is coming to an end.  I have two finals on Wendesday (Orchestra and US History) and then two more on thursday (latin...shoot me, and English)  Not so bad.  Then it's three month of almost no comittment.  I have to babysit and start teaching piano.  I'm quitting GAP because I'm not getting the hours and Amy is a bitch, so other than that it will be fun.  I'll get to see Nate lots. I don't know what's wrong with me.  I really have tons of fun (and I mean it) with Nate, but I'm just afraid that something is going to happen and we're going to end up hurt.  That's what always happens. But I don't want it to happen this time, but if I think too much, it will.  Why am I like this?  I can't allow myself to have fun because I over analyze EVERYTHING and stop myself before I get in too far.  Once I get over that void in my mind, everything is going to be perfect.  I know he won't hurt me and I won't hurt him...well not intentionally.  I just need to get past the what if's and focus on the good.  Like how we just click and everyhting falls together.  Thats the problem, I'm afraid of falling.  Nothing good comes from it.  If you fall it hurts, no matter the height.  I don't wnant pain for me or him.  I've had my share of shitty relationships and he's the first guy I've ever felt that I could turn to and depend on.  I guess, what I'm afraid of most is things going back to how it was last year.  The constant darkness, being happy on the outside.  I just got pulled out of it and I don't want to want to go back in because I don't know when I'll see the light again.  But the best thing that happened to me pulled me out of the worst thing that happened to me, so nothing bad will happen right? So that's what it's like to be in my head.  Kind of scary huh?  I just need to sleep, I'm over thinking.  I like him way to much to let this get to me.  -Cally
