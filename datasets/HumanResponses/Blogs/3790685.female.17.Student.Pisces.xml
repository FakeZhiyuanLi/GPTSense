      Well looky here...its me again..I am at Kates house and we are currently uh I guess u could say "babysitting"...altho there isnt much sitting goin on. BUT we are making a movie theater for the three kids in which they have fake money to buy their tickets and snacks. And yes I am wearing a visor hat so as to be an employee and we have a fake register and fake tickets and a lil consetion stand...who is having more fun here..the kids or us? I dunno.. NOW...we are ordering two large pies and cheesy bread just for me and kate...Oink! This weekend is full of events including another wonderous girlz nite at Nina's...should be molto interesante! Kate just informed me that the Domino's Pizza guy is her lover/stalker. I have NO comment on that...We are currently listening to Jem and discussing uh..stuffs. yea...boredom and craziness..as u can see I am always a mix of emotions ready to change at any split second...scary isnt it??? But...at the same time...I can be very dependable..hmm..I guess I am confused at even this very thing...who am I???? I DONT EVEN KNOW ANYMORE!!! Altho I am totally aware of who I am and what I wanna do wit my life but at the same time i have no clue...does that make any sense??? I think it does!!!


  I hate u...I love u..I just cant remember to forget u...
  who are u? who needs u? u make me feel alive
  I die...so hi..I'm crawling on the ground and I found I can fly...
  Its simple..confusing..the truth is..I'm winning I'm losing...
  I'm pulling nd pushing...wont do me any good..it could..it should...
  I'm honest to myself that the truth is I lied...
  One of these days it all comes together..one of those days that goes on forever..
  Think I sound crazy..maybe..whatever
  WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT???
  It's about life, its about fun, its over b4 it has begun..
  It's about YOU, its about ME, its about everything btwn.
  Its about time that I......
  ..make up my mind

      Ok so I been stayin up later and later to watch my new "summer TV shows"...of course I gotta see friends, then family guy...THEn I mite as well stay up until conan o'brien...and then how could I go to sleep and miss that 70's show..so u can clearly see my delema. Well I was informed by Joseph Desmond last nite at the meeting that this is a very unpersonal way to tell people about your thoughts and things going on. He says he has no need to talk to any of us anymore and that from now on he can only talk about himself...hey as long as he isnt't terrorizing my parents to NOT ALLOW me to do stuff...thats fine wit me. So..today's service was good altho i felt like i really wanted to be zealous and walk to all my returns...I wasnt exactly feeling up to it..and I felt very winey and tired in service...but also very commical..it was a mix of emotions...BUT I will end by saying that Nina still smells and I dont care who she calls...HA! and....Kate u are marrying a chinese man!!! lol.

   "Woke up early this morning
  Made my coffee like I always do
  Then it hit me from nowhere
  Everything I feel about me and you"


WEll this weekend is full of events for our congregation..which I think is great!!! Just in case you didnt hear my 50 million reminders..and yes..this quite often happens...so don't say no one told u...here are the upcoming events:

  1. Spumoni Garden's Pizzeria and Icecream after the bookstudy tomorrow nite (Thurs.)
  2. Softball game at park near the bridge Saturday after service at 3 pm.
  3. Beach Day at either Reese Park or Robert Moses beach all day Monday.

         Hey everyone...once again I got started b/c I wanted to post some comments..and guess wat??? u gotta be a member...this is how they suck everyone in...well here I am. Ok I will warn u..I am not quite the writer such as Nola and Nina are...so this will not be all inciteful and worded all pretty...and yes I dont ever end sentences I sort of just put dots in btwn. thoughts..as u may have noticed. Well...I just got back from Upstate NY and I cant explain how much the country makes me feel full of life. I feel more aware of life and my feelings and who I am. I sware I find myself everytime I go, and somehow I feel more like myself, more like I belong. It was nice to get away on my own and be with 2 girls my age and be ON OUR OWN basically the whole weekend. Just the three of us on the road blasting the music and talkin about stuff that 17 year old girls talk about...you can only imagine...
    Well I got to go to my first drive-in movie which was awesome..we were all squished in the front with blankets and my boyfriend elmo..who yes loves ME more megan in case u were wondering, he's sitting next to ME rite now lol oh and the movie was 5 dollars for TWO movies...yes a lot diff. than here. it was about 50-55 degrees the whole weekend there. But it was beautiful and the heated pool was about 85 degrees so yes we still went in. I also got to experience a country bon fire in which I met youngins my age from three diff. congregations. Made a lot of new friends whom I instantly clicked with and got close with. Me and meg got thrown into the pool fully clothed...grrr...thanks Eason! Also got to play hide and go seek in the pitch black dark in the woods...with yes...BUGS...lol. 
   The best tho was layin on the roof lookin at the stars talkin with megan about life and love with our blankets and bottles of root beer. I felt like a real country girl..altho Megan and Ashley inform me that I am no where close...lol. Sorry if spiders freak me out and I call a pond a lake. 
    Also....I got to drive on the highway on the way home for 2 hours doing 65 mph, and mark and melissa said they were very impressed..I stayed at the speed limit in the lines and I even passed people and did very well! I did basically a third of the driving home, so I shared the load and it was great! I feel like a real driver after that!!!
    I saw a lot of movies..."the day after tomorrow"..awesome Jack wat ever his name is--is a HOTTIE and has the most incredible eyes...yep those lite eyes really do it! And it was a good movie. There was also "vertical limit", "dodgeball"(very funny), "the chronicles of riddick"(hard to follow),and "the secret window" (very freaky at 5 AM in the country...but Johnny Depth..awesome), and I finished "the notebook" in two days...most amazing book EVER! A story of two lovers together at 17 and seperated for over 10 years...but destiny and true love brought them back together..it is a story of passion and love, and soooo sad at the end...I was more than tearing I was actually shaking in hysterics...and had a headache from crying soo bad..cant wait for the movie!!!
  Ok...I promise future logs will NOT be this long...hope u enjoyed my ramblings...and I luv all of ur guts...Meg and Ash and everyone else Upstate I miss ya!!! To all my brooklynites, and others..I missED u...snuggles and mwwaz to all!!!

        haha i, Jonathan Labrucherie,&nbsp;have taken over this "blog" thingy to tell you little kiddies about the worst nite at the chevalier house EVER! so sit down and prepare urselves, for i am VERY TIRED and will try to CAPITALIZE THINGS so as to make it more EXCITING!!! isnt it more exciting already? uh-huh, i thought so...  
  it all started on a nite, not unlike this one, for it was actually a FEW MINUTES AGO!!!&nbsp;so put urselves in a dark, mysterious, well-decorated home in BAYRIDGE BROOKLYN!!! here sits our protagonist Sue (played by mandy moore), sitting alone at her computer...or so she THOUGHT!!! for she was not alone...oh no, she was VERY not alone! she was ALL KINDSA not alone! as she was&nbsp;typing a message to her friend(played by&nbsp;Robert DeNiro) and smiling and giggling, little did she know that a stranger entered her room...a SILVER COLORED STRANGER!! yes, it was the dreaded antagonist&nbsp;Herbert, THE MEMBER OF AN UNKNOWN SPECIES BUG!!!(played by ashton kutcher), and he was HUNGRY!! so, slipping behind the some-seeing eyes of Sue,&nbsp;Herbert snuck into the kitchen and tot he fridge, where a large&nbsp;SANDWICH lay. as the minutes passed, Herbert devoured the meal and soon staggered off to his home in the basement, behind Dave's bench press and turn-ya-upside-down thingy. but, disoriented by the mayonaise, he crawled across the floor, startling our girl Sue. Poor Herbert just wanted to go home, but he was lost! he crawled up the walls and managed to scare the crap outta Sue! so, with his last desperate attempts to stay un-squashed, he crawled on THE CEILING!!! out of her reach, he could drop upon her and STRIKE!!! but he didnt want to, really, for he had grown to likin the girl, he didnt wish ot SCARE HER!!! sue, in the meantime, was hyperventilating and screaming out to her friend, who will go unnamed, for help, which he was unable to give. his wimpy attemts at encouragement gave her the strength to go out and KILL HERBERT!!! thankfully for lil Herby, he found the way out before the murderous Sue could do any harm...but the damage was done, and i am here to tell u about it...THE HORROR of the BUG~!!!! Suewould not be the same...until she got her next flavor ice fix...THE END  
  scary huh? i thought so...it could happen to u and all whom u love and cherish, so tell them not to leave small, silverfish-sized sandwiches inside ur house...YOU COULD BE NEXT!!! notice, however, how the story started out good then smal amounts of Suck began to seep in? yeah, well, u can blow it out ur ear, cuz im tired, ok? all this hacking has me sleepy! GO TO BED&nbsp;U LIL FREAKS!!! oh, and i have emotion for each of u...haha buh-bye. i now return u to ur regularly scheduled program...

      KATIE!!!!!!!! It's only been 2 1/2 weeks since I've seen u last...but it feels liek ages! This blog is dedicated to you...I hope u had a blast in Hawaii...hope u had one of those breathtaking moments! I remember sitting out on the balcony, with a palm tree flowing in the wind on one side and a band down belong me playing sweet melodies, as the sky turned 12 different shades of orange, and the sun sparkled in the pacific ocean, and as if I were in a dream, the air almost smelled sweet and the breeze felt magical, there is this amazing feeling there, and at that moment tears were brought to my cheeks thinking of how amazing Jehovah's creations were...and how well he knows how to move humans and touch our emotions, well obviously, he created us that way...anyway yea I'm sure u had a wonderful time! And now that ur back... we can coninue our "crazy summa nites" episodes....I missed ya sooo much, and thought I'd take the time to explain to everyone how much of an amazing friend u are!
  It all started back wen KT like 3 and I was 6, we did a play called "Disney and You" and the lil mermaid (me) was put in charge of helping lil tinker bell (kate) and I tried to explain that picking her nose wouldnt be a good idea come curtain time, BUT unfortunatley there were a couple slip ups, yes this is how the whole friendshop began..anyway then wen she was like 5 and I was 8,&nbsp; we used to play barbies together,&nbsp;we used to list the things we had in common, and sumtimes get into trouble at bookstudies wen we'd laugh hysterical b/c I'd bleep out certain words in the scriptures...like the thing Jesus came riding in on...well&nbsp;we grew a lil older and were very creative lil girls...we would spent endless Saturdays being bored and then decide to make houses out of garage supplies and set up lemonade stands, we'd make tents and once we both had an asthma attack at her block party and carried each other back to the house. Yes then finally we see ourselves now, not much has changed, we are still very energetic creative gurls, altho we spend most of our time listenin to music, lookin thru magazines, and hours just talkin, we still have so much in common, we have sum sort of telepathic connection which is freaky, I can look at kate and she knows exactly wat I'm thinkin and will start laughin uncontrollably, and so will I, and we cant even breathe, and everyone around us is left clueless to our craziness. Then there is Babushka, kates alter ego for those who dont already know... well come 3 am, its a scary transformation but then there is no turning bak, we can spent the rest of the nite up laughing at nothing at all...and ya no wat...there are very few people that I can share moments like these with....

      Ok so today was definitly a very eventful and exciting day... it starts off with our MARATHON SERVICE DAY...I believe the only ones who actually partook in all 12 hours (8 am - 8 pm) were Nina, Glo, and myself. BUT we couldnt have done it w/o the ones who helped us all day (including my mom, Jessy,&nbsp;Hutty Dar "Dorothy",&nbsp;Rosa, Ali, Alisha, Joe, da kids, and Matt and Abby&nbsp;who both stayed out late) THANKS&nbsp;TO ALL! Well...I&nbsp;finished my time for the month and also made a new friend! Matt ur sister is awesome, u really must bring her to Brooklyn more often! Well... then we find a stray kitty next door to the kingdom hall. He is tiny enough to fit in the palm of ur hand. He is orange and white...so cute!&nbsp;and oh the green eyes! And he's very lovable...only one problem, he has ring worm and we cant even touch him for two weeks. Now I am debating wether to keep him or give him away at the end of the two weeks...at first I was&nbsp;a lil skeptical...like how will Rocco react? can we handle another pet? BUT...I am thinkin by two weeks I will already be attached, in which case this pet will be&nbsp;ALL MINE...meaning i have to care for it myself, but&nbsp;its&nbsp;way easier than Rocco anyway! Besides...I already got some names I am thinkin of..please give me sum suggestions!!!&nbsp;ok sooo...so far this&nbsp;is wat I got... 
    Pumpkin  Rusty  Job (Abby's idea)  Bubblez (my mom suggested that one...lolol, its actually cute tho)   Well as u can see this aint much of a list, but tell me wat u think of these, and then please add sum suggestions...also...we arent sure if we really want him yet, so if u would like a kitten, who will be completely healthy in two weeks, please speak up!!! Let me know!  Ok so anyway bak to my day...it was such an awesome service day, 12 hours of like real hard core service! WHOO! I did all my calls I really needed to do, I had 2 door step studies, both about a half hour each, and they were second time around studies! One said she mite come wit her family to the meeting, and my third top priority call...was busy with her 4 kids but was sooo happy I remembered her and came by, she is so sweet, it was just all around awesome, and we were with fun people! Thanks Nina nd Glo again sooo much! I fuff u guys! (as macky would say)...ah yes and then we helped the Bowman's do sum packing...and I just got home at 11 PM, from a very fulfilling day I must say! No better feeling then servin Jehovah all day and bein wit the people u love!!! I dont care if I sound corny...cause guess wat??? I AM!!!! lolol. One more thing b4 I go...gurlz..."I'm on the... TOP of the wo-o-o-rld lookin down on creation, and the only explanation I can find, is the love that I found ever since u been around...."  &nbsp;

      I realized that never before have I been so happy about my life as I am right about now. I mean I am generally a happy-go-lucky sort of person, but of course like anyone else I have my down moments...but these past couple of months, I dont think I've had anything to even be upset about...I mean everything seems to be going perfect almost...which scares me a lil...something is bound to go wrong....well just wait till school starts, that has enough stress that comes along with it to make anyone depressed and cry for no reason. Anyway my point is...in past years I have been so stressed out that my eye would start twiching...do any of you remember that out in service? But this year, there havent been too many dramas, and if i'm feelin down I think of all the good things, and listen to a couple happy songs (see recent post about 60 feel good songs).
  &nbsp;I mean I got Jehovah and his service to keep me busy, and there is no other work that makes me happier. I'm lucky enough to be in a congregation with awesome, fun elders, and fun pioneers, who make service enjoyable and are so zealous that u are always excited to&nbsp;go out in service. Then I have great friends who have always been there for me, who are great to go for to advice, and who definitly make everyday ur with them something to remember and its always very entertaining! I LOVE UR GUTS!!!!!!!!! I also basically know exactly what I wanna do with my life, my goals are there, and my options are endless, I'm very excited to be almost 18 and be starting my life as a young adult, starting to make my own decisions. And...love just seems to be in the air everytime I take in a breathe, life almost seems wonderful!&nbsp;
  So I guess wat I am saying is that I am so thankful for everything and everyone in my life, I wouldnt switch mine with anyone's for the world! And I hope everyone else is happy...if ur not then I need to cheer u up...or atleast&nbsp;I will try! I think I will declare this Happy week! If u have anything u wanna share that makes u happy or that u are thankful for in ur life, please comment, and encourage us all! :)

        Well, a couple of nites ago, seeing that I have an obsession with love and stories about love, I have always had an interest in the story of the shulamite maiden and her mutual love with a shephard boy. So...I decided to read the song of solomon for my nightly bible reading, and altho this usually consists of one or two chapters a nite at least, I ended up reading the entire book. I never realized how romantic the bible is! lol. It's such a beautiful not just story but real life experience of&nbsp;love . It really touched me and it was also funny at parts...a.k.a Solomon 8:8-10. LOL. Anyway...I thought I would share sum interesting highlights with you...here is an overview of the story, but I suggest you read it from the bible...and Solomon 8:6,7 describes how deep their love for one another was.  
   
      ok well...this link thing is not working..sooo, if ud like to read this, sorry, ull have to get it from the scriptures inspired book yourself...enjoy! But the whole book of Solomon is&nbsp;worth reading if u havent read it in a while, just confusing who is speaking, the speakers keep switching...very romantic and very funny and a good example of true love for us all!

      ok so I am bored..cant think of anything to write about..soo...I will tell u about my weekend...saw the notebook..it was absolutely amazing of a movie, better than the book, which is quite rare. Bring a couple of boxes of tissues if u plan on seeing it, and hopefully u wont cause a scene like I did and OMG hottie Ryan Gosling is worth going to see it for, even if u dont like sappy love stories or strong dramatic emotions..like i do! :) u will def. enjoy seein him! sigh...Anyway, then...there was a lot of service, had some really good calls this weekend actually...then today went to Gino's after the meeting...gooood food! Then watched Moulin Rouge at Joe and Tyson's...again for those going to see the notebook, dont go with either of them or "the chuck"...they have no mercy for dying characters...and u will end up against ur will with tears of laughter...dumb boyz!...I mean we love u guys!

        Now I'm all alone again..no where to turn, no one to go to
  Without a home, wihtout a friend, without a face to say hello to
  But now the night is near
  And I can make believe he is here
  Sometimes I walk alone at nite wen everybody else is sleeping
  I think of him, and then I'm happy with the company I'm keeping
  The city goes to bed
  ANd I can live inside my head...
  On My Own
  Pretending he's beside me
  All alone
  I walk w/ him till morning
  Without him
  I feel his arms around me
  And wen I lose my way I close my eyes
  And he has found me
  In the rain the pavement shines like silver
  All the lights are misty in the river
  In the darkness
  The trees are full of starlight
  And all I see is him and me forever and forever
  I love him, but wen the nite is over
  He is gone...the rivers just a river
  Without him, the world around me changes
  The trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers
  I love him...I love him..I love him..
  But only...
  On My Own.

      ok so tonite as I sat in the meeting and we discussed the "learn from the great teacher" book I started thinking about myself wen I was "lil sue"...and I remembered all the family studies from bak then...learning about Jehovah and wow those really were awesome times...i mean they still are of course...but there is this amazing feeling wen u first start to make the truth your own, and hearing all the comments from the younger ones like Aaron, Dory, Dimetrius, and everyone made me want to cry..b/c I was so proud of our lil ones and how much I see them making the truth their one like I once did...and its such an amazing thing! And then Kate tells me that she is "officially" getting baptized now, and altho I know she has made the truth her own a long time ago, she will be demonstrating that to everyone in a lil over a month, and I was again so proud of our lil "village" who have been directed by Jehovah to bring us all up...and I am so grateful for them, for our second, third, fourth, etc. pairs of paretns that I have in my congregation...and I think of how much I will appreciate them wen and if I have children in this system, b/c it's such a responsibility to put that love for Jehovah into ur children, you have to mold their heart...but w/ Jehovah's help, and the congregation it's evident with the examples in our cong. how it can be done! 
Well after all my incitefulness...I will end with another song that I just heard that I'd like to share..sum of u mite know it already its called "the story so far" by New found Glory...



  I cant't remember the time or place
  Or what you were wearing
  It's unclear about how we met
  All I know it was the best conversation
  that I've ever had
  Till this day I've never found someone
  With eyes as wide as urs
  I've been searching up and down this coast
  Overlooking wat I need the most
  Did u notice I was afraid
  Thought I'd run outta things to say

  And everything else is irrelavent to the story so far
  A coincidence that u look like her from a far...
  Is it tru that u like to sleep alone?
  Or is it just wat u tell everyone?
  THe sky will never look the same again
  Until u show me how it could be.

          ok so wow I havent been online in TWO days!!! this is a mirable!!! And now at this current moment I decide to come on and say something. I feel it necessary to speak now as I sip on a lovely glass of colloidal silver water. hm....why am I drinking a glass of colloidal silver water u mite ask??? Well...seeing as I just drank an almost full glass of molded orange juice, i see it necessary!!!And why did I just drink a glass of molded orange juice u mite also ask. well its not b/c it tastes like a chocolate ice cream cone with sprinkles....now is this story going anywhere??? ok it all started about an hour ago w/ this girl...let's call her "yanina" and this girl had a carton of orange juice. And as u can imagine...i some how got involved with the both of them...and now I sit in this chair..thinking of the consequences of this situation. Will I be throwing up tonight? Or something..dun dun dun...even worse. And in case u were wondering... I am sleeping ova Nina's wit kate and glory. Yes its been a very interesting nite so far...nina is telling us of her experiences of life..ah yes the wise and experienced yanina...I mean...Janina. Kate is on the verge of becoming Babushka and glory is being her usual 10 year old turning 18. And here I am going bak in forth from intently listening to writing...trying to not think of why I should be nasus at the moment...but I think i will be alright.
Well I will just end this loverly blog on a very sappy and conemplative note...I am on this Jem frenzy here...and this happens to be my favorite song:

STAY NOW 

  Daylight comes, daylight comes
and you've gotta go
Breaks my heart, breaks my heart
to have to watch you go
Wish I knew, wish I knew
when you'll be back again
However long, it's just too long
until we meet again

Stay now, stay now
just a little more
Coz this love, this love
is what living's for
Stay now

Hide in bed, sheets overhead
blocking out the sun

Feel like we are marooned at sea
away from everyone
And I, I hate to say goodbye
I, want you to touch me one more time

Stay now, stay now
just a little more
Coz this love, this love
is what living's for
Stay now, stay now
just a little more
Coz this love, this love
is what living's for
Stay now
Stay now
Stay now

Anyway... so this picture above is Rooney... There really are 5 guys....but theses are the cute ones!

      ok so this convention, as so many have already said, was the most awesomeist of all...besides the actual program, the after-convention adventures were awesome, and there are no people i would rather have spended my time wit than the ones i did! I LOVE U GUYS!!! (have i not said this enough)...ok well anyway first of all...some awesome points from the convention were as follows...

  main point brought out a lot was: serving Jehovah is the wisest choice we can make. No greater happiness can be found, and wen we do put Jehovah's service FIRST in out lives and in our hearts...everything else will just fall into place (this was brought out both during the session, and by my friends...)  We should endevour to not just know about Jehovah or know we want to serve him, but KNOW him sooo well that nothing else could get in the way of his and our friendship.  A husbands love for his wife should be strong enough that he would give his life for her, and he should demonstrate this to his wife.  Wives having respect for her husband, will gain his love. In return, a husband's love for his wife will gain her respect.  Importance of keeping in out minds that we are not just out in service, going door to door and making RV's...out true goal at all times is to make disciples! (Matt. 28:19, 20)  Interesting point: By memorizing scriptures now that touch out heart and get us thru tough times, it will be in out minds come the day that we may not have a bible in our possession, and we need encouragement...(i just read psalm 31 last nite as part of my bible reading, made me cry...def. good place to start in memorizing encouraging scriptures!)  Jehovah actually DRAWS us to his organization if he sees that our hearts our desirable to him. What a privilage that we were all individually drawn to Jehovah by himself.  Keep paradise (the prize) clear in out minds at all times...can we imagine a convention in the new system...with Moses as the speaker, John the baptizer baptizing new resurrected ones, and us going up to Noah to shake his hand, altho they may still be wet, as the speaker brought out.   Well those were some points that truly touched my heart that i put a star next to...so here...a lil review...feel free to add some points that really touched you as well...

      ok so this past weekend was stinkin awesome! I realized that anything can be exciting wit the rite attitude and people of course. Ok so the village, is a GOOD movie...up there wit some of the best. Some advice tho...DO NOT WATCH ALONE! altho...with people mite be just as bad...if those people happen to be named Chuck! Thanks btw for those special effects...they stayed wit me all nite...even wen i got into my house...but hey i like bein scared, even if it means i gotta sleep in my living room wit the tv and hall lites on, so its all good! Then Saturday was an awesome day in service, even tho my day started at noon...hey Br. O'Bard said it was OK..alrite nina!!! sheesh...lol, so then "da crew" went to watch some old movies at nola's. The first movie was "ok"...sorry that 50 year old men dont appeal to me, even Br. O'Bard understands...haha Jessy were u tellin him about ur love for Cary Grant? ok well anyway, altho some may argue that "strangers on a train" or w/e its called was a bad movie, i beg to differ, it was definitly a pee ur pants experience, i guess all experiences are wit our friends...but me and Mercedes could not breathe we were laughin so hard...and lets not forget nola...and her episodes...but their nothin outta the norm...i think u all got a taste of the tru tru nola...anyway...since we discovered that people who "do things" are intriguing we all decided to have a soccer game Sunday after the meeting, and i tried my best to be defense altho...somehow the ball kept goin rite thru my legs into the net...WELL...i was still kickin everyone and tryin hard...and next time i think i'll be betta...so i'm def. up for havin a game on a regular basis!

Now i sit here, bored outta my mind, but i am thinkin about all the fun this year has brought, i was inspired by nina's blog in my thoughts...and i must say i dunno wat our lives woulda been like w/o our lil crew...i'm glad u guys came from all the places u did...funny how we all come from different places around the country and some of u have only been here for a year, and yet i never felt so close to friends that i could pour out my heart to u guys...it feels like u all have been my lifetime friends...and i hope i never have to say good-bye... I LOVE U GUYS!!!!

      It never ceases to amaze me how Jehovah continually provides exactly wat u need wen u need it. The last couple of days...i've been feeling kinda "out of it", "blah", and "down on myself" i suppose for no reason at all, just not myself...and then i go to the meeting, and there's an awesome C.O. talk esp. just for youths and talking about goals that we can set...and i thought Br. O'Bard was incredible with how he made the ones who have already reached these goals give their experience of how much they have benefitted and been blessed from choosing to use their lives by putting Jehovah first in this way...and the experiences about pioneering esp. touched me b/c thats been my life long goal, yes i had a bit of a tear in my eye. And altho i hadn't given going to bethel that much thought, something Br. Questell said tonite really touched me... "u go to bed wit a happy tired knowing that everything you have done that day was for Jehovah and everyone u've spent ur day with was serving Jehovah with you, what better thing could there be?" and i thought about that...being wit people 24/7 who love Jehovah and the things ur working hard at all day is for him...thats soo tru....makes me wonder if i could beat the very very small odds of a single young sister with no training being accepted to bethel...hmm..i dunno..but i certainly have more things to ponder over before i go bak to skewl and have to make some "serious decisions" about my future...its actually something that stresses me day after day...WHAT DO I DO???...Sometimes i wish someone would just tell me "DO THIS" and i would just do it...but i gotta be my own person now and decide wat i am gonna do wit my life...just scary that some of the decisions i make this year will effect the rest of my life...but i'll do it!!! :)
I know this sounds like my onset problem was solved...but i'm not done. I get into the car on the way home, and my parents started talking about something, as i started listening closer, i realized it was about me...and it was definitly a snuggles moment b/c wat my parents said made me cry...and then my mom saw me crying and she started to cry, and i realized that altho u know ur parents always love you and are proud of u...its nice to hear it sometimes...and that is wat made me feel better about myself, as corny as it may sound...all i needed was to hear it from my very own parents i guess...so now i go bak to being "happy sue"!
