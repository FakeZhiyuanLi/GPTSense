      I am up and awake trust me as soon as my head hit the pillow I was out for the count for a full 8 hours. I am up and have to go to town as I want to get developed the 4 rolls of films I also used on holiday.  I cannot belive how much washing I made for 5 days! but&nbsp;I shall make a start again very soon!  Well was it worth it, you bet it was.... just been going through what I have bought and I spend my budget 3 times over but it was worth it!  The blog is closed now, but I might re-open it if I decide to go on anymore dates.... am thinking of it!!! ;)&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Back home, I suppose at last, such a stupid trip back remind me when I travel to Sweden by plane again to go direct...   Am glad to be home, downloading my pictures already said I would wait till tomorrow but I want to see them!   I have&nbsp;a bruised toe from the dick that stood on my foot at last night's show in Falun, so many drunks, but still I liked the venue, weird place to play a concert!!! but was a fantastic experience to see a show outside of Stockholm.  Now I am home, I want more, I swear if I could I would book my flight back tomorrow and see some more, I need more GT, I never thought this summer&nbsp;would be good, but right now I am the happiest but knackered person on the planet!  I need my bed, I need my sleep and at least I ain't walking the streets of Falun at 3.30am again!  Alfie was pleased to see me! lots of kisses and cuddles... I think he missed me.... he is staring at my moose I bought at Arlanda airport! he's called Billy, and no Alfie you ain't having it!

      We are back in Amsterdam again, and have around 30 mins till we have to board the flight to Manchester again! I have to admit I am so knackered now, that all I want is a hot bath and my own bed.   Please someone remind me next time I come to Sweden than because I save a bit of money coming via god knows where don't do it, because trust me it ain't worth the hassle, I would prefer to fly direct! or maybe it is just the lack of sleep talking!  However less sleep we got last night, I can say that the concert in Falun was good, well worth the trek there on the train, the hanging around and the waiting to get back into Stockholm.... trust me I am glad I did it, and I think Jackie will be in the morning when she gets some sleep!  I now cannot wait to get home to my little baby Alfie, god I have missed hm but have brought plenty of doggy treats back for him!!!!  Well I am not back&nbsp;at work until Wednesday... so will work on my pictures tomorrow and upload some somewhere for you to look at....   I might get online tonight to say I have arrived home, but somehow how&nbsp;I feeling I might not!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      WOW, well we did it, we made it too FALUN! now trust me everytime I hear or say the name FALUN I am going to crack up laughing because it is a town I do not think I will be going back to in a hurry... apolgies for anyone living there or from FALUN but what a shite place! talk about ghost town, oh that is until you reach the concert venue and you see 24,000 people queuing to get in!   We reached FALUN on time, and found ourselves in the middle of nowhere, there was a woman manning a bus desk so we asked her how to get to town... no buses for another hour and the tourist information place would be shut on a Sunday! no worries so we called a taxi to take us to the venue!  It was about a 20 minute walk from the station to there all uphill so we where glad to take a taxi there! Cute taxi driver and it was only 79 SEK to the venue, we passed a Scandic Hotel and asked him if we could get a room but he told us it was already booked for the concert. We made it to Lunget!?? which I might add looked so small..... we saw the queue and could not belive such a place held so many people! We sat in the bus shop, walked around looking for ticket touts, when you want one they don't exist when you don't they are everywhere...  Anyway to cut a long story short, we had lunch in the local swimming pool restaurant and around 6ish when we still had seen no touts we took our own action. Thanx to my chunky signing pen still in my bag from the day before we made our own "TICKETS WANTED X 2" SIGNS and stood on the side of the road holding them, for the queue and any potenial touts to see us! We had a few daft offers from drunks and anyone else that thought they could make a fast buck, in the end we opted with about the 7th person who contacted us and paid 1000 SEK for each ticket but it was soooooooo worth it! We clung onto our tickets and headed for that all famous bus shelter again to pass some time. Bye this point the queue looked like it was finally moving and coming to an end!   At 7ish we spotted the touts, we did not dare ask how much they wanted so tried our best to ignore them, more and more came out waving those famous, "Tickets Here" sign... jeez....   Anyway one hotdog and a coke later we headed into the venue just after 8am, as by now we knew the drill and when the second support act was finished...   Security was not tight going in, which I now know how and why so many drunks got in, and those carrying there own booze with them!  Anyway time past, the stage was almost ready, we even knew what song was coming next, as soon as the map appeared on the stage screen showing HALMSTAD, we knew we where a minute away from hearing the chords of "En Sten.... and seeing the guys on stage...  Can I just say we stood in the middle, and had such a good view for standing, we got nearer and nearer for everysong, and by the final 5 we had pushed our way to the front! YES WE MADE IT TOO THE FRONT ROW!!!   We bumped into Sandra aka Little Girl again... YES AGAIN! she was more shocked that we where to see us in FALUN! and we spotted her again at the end queuing to buy some tour stuff... We also saw Chantie and Saar heading for the front of the queue at around 4.30ish, someone else was with them but I ain't a clue who that was!    The venue cleared quick and this was the bit I did not get, where did those 24,000 people just dissappear too.... we walked to the Scandic Hotel to try and get a room, but no such luck! we sat for a while and got a taxi to the station. By 12.15am we where sat in a cold dark train station with some drunks and lots of bikes knowing our train was not due till 5.58am!   By 1.30am and after a few rounds of eye spy I, HENCE THE I wanted to head back to the Scandic as I felt safer hanging around a hotel, so I called a taxi. We got to the Scandic and we asked the nice guy on the desk if we could stay in reception till our taxi arrived... (there was no taxi, we where cold ... and wanted to sit on the nice soft chairs... He was fine with that... I started to nod off... tried my best to stay awake!!! I did honest!!!   It was not all bad heading back to the hotel, as we saw all the tour buses go past at around 2am (you know the ones carrying all that stage equipment and stuff, I think we counted 6 or 7.   We thought Gyllene Tider where in the hotel also as there was a lot of security hovering around, and some fans shouting there names, too be honest we where so knackered we would not have moved if they had walked into the foyer in front of us!!  Anyway at 3.30am we decided we should head back to the train station, the walk back was so funny, anyone would have thought it was us that where pissed and we where stone cold sober...   But right now, I must go as we need to check out the hotel in 30 mins, so got to get my stuff togeather and make Jackie ain't fell asleep!    More laters... when I get to the airport!!

      My god did last night really happen, I know for me it was the second time to meet Per, but it was so good, and so god damn relaxed!!! We where usher into this little changing room area through the backstage area, thank god so we oculd get away from the noise of TLK!!! We all sat down like we where waiting for our exams results...... must have been around a 10 minute wait or so. Jackie was shaking, her legs and jumping up and down so much, thankfully Linda gave her a few tips on calming down, which she did.  The time came and in walked Anders first.... who just waved his hand and shouted "Hej" followed by a very cute Per! Micke who is so god damn sexy laughed with his sense of humour, the Goran and MP came on in too!  The guys signed our stuff, and I got some photos, not all that great but a good one with Micke took by Jackie. Eugene took some official fanclub photos.   Me and Jackie where having a joke with Micke. Anders laughed cause we where from England! (yes he remembered you three Fliss, Klair and Ailsa from the carpark!) He seems a little worried when I warned him would be back soon to haunt him!!! :)    MP and Goran did not really do much just signed our stuff....  I think it lasted around 15 minutes then it was time to go, I got to shake Per's hand on the way out when really I wanted to give him a big hug. I certainly said more words that I did last time.  The guys went and we had a few minutes to gather our stuff. Everyone from the fanclub M&G showed up and there was also a family there with there 2 children.   We went back out and me and Jackie headed outside to think and to STILL avoid the noise of TLK! We found a bench and Eugene came out some time later to transfer the pictures to his laptop, so we got a sneaky peek at them! :) Very good camera is that he has!!! some good photos of all the M&G winners with the band can't wait to get my hands on a copy!!!  I swaped my standing ticket with a tout for a seat as I did not fancy standing so long, Thabkfully I got a good seat, in block A again okay I also paid an extra 300 SEK but it was worth it. I took lots of photos with my own camera, so I can't wait to download them when I get home! Jackie was sat over in block O but she also had a good view and was a little higher than me, some of the photos she took are fantastic!   The concert was as good as the last one... the guys where so good on that stage, I know understand why some people go to more than 2 concerts, you get so hooked!   Met up with Jackie on the way out, and she thought what I was thinking!! should we head to Falun, it would have been so great to have caught a 3rd concert!   But alas when we got back to the hotel I went onto ticnet and there where no seats left to buy, it would have been a bit risky to have gone up there in the hope of using a tout and a major let down to have missed out if there where no tickets!  Well I have to go for now someone is waiting to use the PC here at the hotel, catch you soon!  Ally x

      Well lots of shopping done today, we walked into Gamla Stan from the hotel to browse the shop then onto Slussen. We took the tube back into town! bought my CD's I wanted and some tacky tourist stuff! Chilled out in hotel this afternoon for a bit so can prepare for round 2 this evening.  We bumped into Sandra aka Little Girl in Gamla Stan with her friend, both lugging there suitcase with them..... fancy just bumping into someone in the whole size of Stockholm!  Jackie has been out shopping she is spending money like water! She is wearing her GT T-SHIRT with pride!  Well we are about to head off for an early tea late dinner and then make our way up to the stadium!!!  Eugene from the fanclub has sent me a text about where we are meeting tonight for the MEET AND GREET! WHOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOO WE CANNOT WAIT!

      WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW, will someone pinch me over and over again as I cannot get the fact I was there last night, it was so fantastic.........   The support act suck, everyone else was right about that! but when they hit the stage well words cannot describe how I felt... it was so bloody cool!!  Me and Jackie had great seats last night, the first block and the right hand side of the stage, so we got a great view of everything. I took a whole roll of film last night and I hope to get it developed today!!  We met Fliss, Klair and Ailsa (helloooooooooooooooo) those fellow UKers that have such stamina to stand at the front for each concert they have gone too! Have a safe journey home this evening!   On the way home at the station, we saw Little Girl (hello sandra)only by the time we noticed it was her, she had gone! DAMN we where too late to say hello!  We got back into central station at around midnight, where we queued up for around 20 mins for a McDonalds!!   Back to the hotel and into bed.... am I ready to do it all again this evening!  YOU BLOODY BET I AM!!!

      Okay we both had a great day today, we met up with Spyboo at the city hall and exchanged money for tickets! we then headed back to the hotel as Jackie wanted to collect some more dosh to spend! We then did the TV Tower and had an hour of so there, went to the top, chilled out and took the tram back into town. We then went onto the Vasa Museum where I got a free poster for taking part in a survey, the swede was mighty impressed that I had been 4 times already. Gave Jackie the poster as she is going to frame it. Bought some bits and bobs but not manged to buy any CD's yet!  Headed back to the hotel at around 3.30pm as I wanted some much needed sleep before this evening! It is now 17.21 and Jackie is getting ready and we are taking the tube to the stadion very soon!   I think we did an awful lot of walking today, god we even walked to the city hall from the hotel, did not think it was far but it WAS!  Tomorrow I intend to go buy my gifts and some CD's, not sure what Jackie wants to do.  So excited about this evening, spotted someone in Mcdonalds yesterday with the Gyllene Tider hat on! I want that so much!!!   Well I guess I shall try and report back here after the concert, unless I am pissed! and also depends what time we get back to the hotel! the joys of free internet access even if the PC is from the year dot!  Missing my baby, I am sure he is fine, not phoned home yet will sometime tomorrow...  I am still sneezing and coughing to death but NOTHING will spoil tonight!  Now I must go prepare for this evening!!  GYLLENE TIDER............. HERE I COME!!!

      Hello people, I just touched down in Holland a few moments ago!&nbsp;  This morning was a total nightmare let me begin.... First of all I did not get paid from my employer, I went to them to find out why and they  DID  have the wrong sort code!!!  ARSES&nbsp;OR WHAT...  after much phone calling from them to my bank and me doing the&nbsp;same, my bank have found the money it was stuck in Canary Wharf in London! so they have said it will be in my bank account a 6pm this evening... trust me my employer could not apologies enough! So all that chasing around this morning ment I was so knackered I could not be arsed getting a&nbsp;train to airport and all I wanted was a cup of tea!   I also spent 20 minutes queuing up in the Chemist to get my drugs! much needed..... so&nbsp;I opted in calling a taxi and it gave me enough time at Dad's to grab some toast and tea....   I got to Manchester airport and spent 20 minutes queuing up to check in, only to be told when I got to the front that I needed to go to the ticket desk... off I trotted and got there only to queue another 15 minutes to be seen. There seems to be major problems with flights into Amsterdam and they wanted to change me onto a flight in Paris and out of Paris onto Stockholm&nbsp;, which in all honesty I would not have minded in the slightest..... but in the end they did not, and I went to queue again to check&nbsp;in got through though pretty quick this time and headed for departures. Couple of strong&nbsp;coffees later and some water and&nbsp;more drugs I made my way to the gate...   Flight was fine,&nbsp;very full and I had the most spitting image of Anne Frank sat next to me on the plane traveling alone, she must have been around&nbsp;14 years old. Just arrived into Amsterdam&nbsp;at 14.55 and I have to board my flight to Stockholm at 16.00hrs so I have some time to freshen up and grab a drink.   Feeling&nbsp;better, can't help wondering if Jackie made it to Stockholm yet, although she has some time till the plane lands, and if she was sent via Paris or anywhere else for that matter, guess I will find out when I get to the bus station in Stockholm.   Well gotta go, need the loo and some water, my throat is parched for a drink!   Hejda!!   Ally  x

      God trying to wake Dad up for a lift to the doctors was a nightmare, I swear he would sleep through an earthquake! I have been to Landmark house our resident 24 hour doctor and can happily say I have now got a 7 day course of antibiotics to take. Going to pick them up from the chemist on my way to the airport. Reviled now to say the least that I have then, if I get three into me today should be feeling better by the morning. Now I can sit back and enjoy my holiday. They told me to come down at 7.20am I got seen by 7.10am was in and out in a couple of minutes. All praise to the NHS this time from me!  Still no wages in the bank, don’t know why but I suspected something would go wrong in getting paid…. God they pay you £4.50 an hour and can’t even get the money in the bank!   Well I am setting off to the airport at 9am, going via the nearest chemist. Seems I am taking the train to the airport after all….  Well I hope to write something when I get to Amsterdam, until then! BYEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

      Went back to bed, got a bit more sleep, had a bath… trying to hang out till I call Dad for a lift to doctors as he won’t appreciate me waking him up to early. With a bit of luck I should make it before I head to the airport. I think it's best I go, as don't want what I have to get worse before I go away and what's more I do not want it spoiling my time away.   Jackie should be heading to the airport around about now, she is checking earlier so she can get a seat in the aisle as she needs to keep her leg out with the problem she has, I am sure she will get the seat she wants.   Well in a couple of hours I should be sitting in the airport!

      Okay I am up and awake, it is 2.52am and as I know my own body only too well can tell my nice sore throat is turning into a chest infection and I am going to need some antibiotics to clear this up, cause trust me this is going to get worse till it gets better. 12 months, over 12 months since I got something like this and BINGO the day I go away I get sick, I am pissed off right now. Called out of hours surgery to get a visit, If I go to our local doctors 24 hour place…. Will I make it?

      In 24 hours I will be in the hotel, I hope!   Well I am all packed for tomorrow… just about squeezed everything into my suitcase. So glad I opted to take the extra bag to put the shoes in would never have got everything into 1 suitcase.   House is all clean and tidy, although still don’t see why I bothered as leaving Alfie here alone, means it will be worse than ever when I return!  So as long as it looks clean it will do!  Dad has been over so I have showed him where I keep all Alfie’s stuff that he needs. I suspect Alfie wonders what is happening as he has been watching me pack my suitcase all evening!   Don’t fancy travelling on the train tomorrow, so might get a taxi up to the airport, and of course that depends on whether I get paid or not, I bloody ought to…. Just being a first wage I worry they have the wrong bank details or something!  So if I get the train I have to go at 9am, if I grab a taxi I don’t need to leave till 10am, so you know which I prefer to do…. Besides having three bags is a bit of a drag for the train! Really would have thought dad would have given me a lift, but he moans he won’t find his way back… huh? Done okay before… and he isn’t doing anything else.  I hope I get better nights sleep tonight, sore throat is still with me, tried to get rid of it, wish now I had got to GP this morning for some antibiotics in case it gets worse. Very much doubt I could get an appointment in the morning before I go, but I might try if it is any worse in the morning. I don’t want this to bring down my much deserved holiday.  Just booked my taxi to pick me up on Monday evening with telecars. Always get a taxi back as the beauty of this taxi company is they are there to pick you up when your flight lands, so no hanging around.  Well guess I should call it a night, I need my sleep!

      Okay so much for not getting up early… said I was feeling a little under the weather last night I was cold…. Later on in the night I went so hot, and when I said hot I mean hot, I was walking around the garden at 12.30am with the dog to cool off! This morning I wake up with a sore throat. GREAT! Not been sick in what 12 months and now I have a sore throat, it is not so bad and I think with some over the counter stuff I can get rid of it, what you betting I have picked it up for the hospital!  Well 1 day to go, this time tomorrow I shall be preparing to head to the train station, I just pray I get paid from my employer. My first wage packet is due tomorrow, I will go mad if they balls it up! It would just be my luck!  Well I was up at just after 7am, I have pulled out the suitcase and will pack later this afternoon, got some cleaning up to do this morning and pack the rucksack, make sure I don’t forget anything!  Decided I will go visiting to see mum, a couple of hours won’t mess up my routine to much today and I want to see her before I go to Sweden.  Fingers crossed I can get rid of this blessed sore throat by tomorrow?  More laters xxx

      Back from the hospital and I am feeling kind of knackered… all this running around makes one very tired so I aim to have a lie in bed tomorrow morning, if of course my 4 legged friend will let me! Trust me a lie in to me is around 8am!   Online waiting for Jackie to come in from work, although could do with my bed… but I need to play with the little fellow for a while also.   Mum was fine in hospital, again they have done nothing and she has not even seen the consultant yet even though he was on the ward today. They are now talking about doing the bone marrow test but there is a waiting list as it is quite popular thing to have done, so god knows how long she will be in. I don’t have to go visiting tomorrow, but providing I get my packing done I should be able to get the chance to pop up as normal.   Had my hair done, I am now a blonde, to me it looks better than my own hair colour which is neither one thing or another just a yucky brown!     Plan on doing nothing tomorrow, except packing and have to nip to supermarket as mum wants some bits and pieces taking up.   Well that is my entry for tonight…. Catch you tomorrow, now for a good nights sleep!  ZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

      2 DAYS TO GO!!!! YIPPPEEEEE, get today over with and you could say we’re on our way!! Hooray!! Busy little day for me today, Got to nip into town and collect the camera film I put in yesterday, thank god no more developing for a while now I have gone digital! Need to get a few bits, and later on around lunch time finally having my hair cut, opted for the blonde look again. Not quite the Marie blonde I use to do as a teen but a more subtle look….  I must today make sure I bag up Alfie’s dry food for him while I am away, make it as simple as possible for dad to feed and look after Alfie why I am away. My poor little baby will miss me loads, I just know it.   Will head up to visiting mum at around 3ish today, I pray they do something today as just sitting in a hospital bed, not daring to eat the NHS hospital crap they call food is enough to make anyone sick!   Well more later, here’s hoping I can get most stuff done today so can totally chill out tomorrow!

      Hej Hej! Swedish mode on now, time is drawing near! Well had a good day so far, pick up some SEK and some Euros at the post office in town and also bought the one thing I had wanted for so long! A DIGITAL CAMERA!! WHOOPPEEEEEEEEE and boy this thing rocks! Got myself a bargain I did! £99 from Currys, well with the extra memory card I spent around £140. Hoping to bag another memory card at the airport for tax free shopping with a bit of luck, only problem is what do I do with those 7 rolls of camera film I bought!!!   Been testing the camera out, took some pictures of Alfie, well there isn’t much else to take pictures of at the moment. Would like to go into town with it, and shoot some pictures there, might do that tomorrow as got to nip in town in the morning to pick up the camera film I put in this morning for developing. Ha ha, hopefully will be the last for a while!  Well going to visit mum laters, called her earlier check she was okay and mainly to see if she needed anything taking up but she didn’t.   Well few days left, having my hair done tomorrow, going blonde! ;)

      Busy busy day today for me, finally got round to do some much needed housework, all the washing is done and ironed. It took me 30 minutes alone to hoover up the dog hair’s Alfie left behind on the leather sofa, I swear that dog moults enough hair for 12 Jack Russells!   We went hospital visiting this afternoon, mum looks well again, hopefully those hospital doctors will get round to doing something tomorrow as she has been in for 5 days and nothing has been done! Which I find a waste of time and is unfair on mum who just gets to sit in a hospital bed 24/7 and pays £3 a day for the privilege of hospital TV.  5 days till the holiday I am already now. Going into town tomorrow morning to collect my Swedish money! And also some Euros for the stop over in Amsterdam, just enough to get a drink and some time in the internet café there, I mean how the hell I am going to pass 2 hours otherwise!   Well start packing on Wednesday, no reason to start earlier, I am a quick packer, can have it done in 15 minutes. Just think this time next week I will be preparing to come home!   Roll on Thursday get the ball rolling, the next couple of days will really drag I know it! I have decided to take the train to Manchester airport as it should only take 45 minutes. Dad will drive me to the train station, let’s hope the train arrives on time!    Well I am hoping the next couple of days I can sit back and chill out, start my holiday early…..

      Back from Hospital visiting… mum is in good sprits, quite happy. She says they might not need to do the bone marrow thing now, and might opt for the blood transfusion, so we shall have to see what happens on Monday!  She loved the balloon, and the cake, not much staff on but we left a few pieces for them. Never nice being in hospital on your birthday, but at least we did our best to cheer her up! Now she has her TV active on the bed, she can take incoming calls, so will call her later as well!    Back now, dogs walked, eaten tea. 5 days to go! Going to do some stuff this evening in prep for the departure day. Got to bag up Alfie’s food for Dad, so he knows what to feed him! So scared of leaving my baby for all that time without me, I know he will miss me! Just hope my nice new leather sofa is still nice and new when I get back!   It seems I made it into the Swedish newspaper “Expressen” today. I emailed them on Friday thanking them for the good coverage of the concert and excellent photos. Telling them I was looking forward to the Stockholm shows. They printed it along with my name. Did not know about it till Ted told me it was there. I wanted it scanned but he don’t know how to scan items! Asked on TDR, but no one has emailed it too me yet…. Oh well not to worry. It is not online on the Expressen website…   Well got to go, lots to get done!

      What with 5 days to go, this time next week I will have seen the Stockholm 1 concert, and will be awaiting Saturday night to come so I can take part in the meet and greet with Per... whoops, I mean Gyllene Tider! (yeah of course I wanna see the other guys??)  Just doing some more holiday washing, my new coat and trousers came yesterday, so just running them through the washing machine!   Been to Asda with dad to get the weekly shop done, will be going to visit mum in hospital around 1ish. Spending longer with her today as it's her birthday (57), taking a cake for her and also she can share it with the staff! lots of pressies, cards... and some of those colourful balloons to brighten up her bed! well bad enough being stuck in hospital on your birthday let alone a boring ward where half the people are sent home for the weekend!  Well I shall report back laters

      Well I finally finished work today for the vacation! YIPPEEE, you know I have only worked there for 3 weeks, feels like 10 years – I have to find another job when I get back from SWEDEN and bloody fast also!  Well been hospital visiting got back some time ago, mum was in good sprits. While we where there they moved her to another bed again, so she has slept in 3 different beds over 3 nights! They have this TV thing over the bed, coast £1.90 a day for TV, but it goes off at 5am regardless of when you put the £1.90 in. So tried to set it up calling this number to register her, bought a smart card for £3.50, and balls the TV was not working, so they have to send someone out tomorrow as there is problems signing it on!! Why are things never simple!   Anyhow I say she was in good sprits, they have not done anything, not done the bone marrow test as the consultant surgeon whatever was fully booked today so will more than likely be on Monday now. Hospitals always go quiet over the weekend, so doubt she will even see a doctor now till Monday. It’s her birthday tomorrow, what a place to be on your birthday! Going to get her a little cake from ASDA, and also one of those balloons to brighten up her bed! At least can try and make it extra special for her whilst she is in there.   Tomorrow is supermarket in the morning and visiting in the afternoon, later tomorrow evening got some stuff to do in preparation for the trip!  6 DAYS TO GO!!!!!!!

      Be warned this travel diary is changing into a normal diary as this rate... god!   7 DAYS TO GO!!!!!!!!!   Just got back from visiting mum, she has been moved into a side ward now as there was a free bed. She was sat up talking, Dr Waldeck saw her today and explained that the blood test results where not all that good, and they could not understand why she was so anaemic as the increase in the epo 4 weeks ago should have solved that but it has not. Tomorrow they will take a small amount of Bone Marrow from her pelvis to test the red and white cells in the blood. I am quite confused over this but just did a little online research and it does not sound too bad, seems like a common thing in people with chronic renal failure.  It will be a painful procedure for her, but will be done under a local anaesthetic. I am not sure what they are expecting to find, that is different that what a normal blood test will show, so yes I get it is a worrying time for her and of course for me and dad.   I presumed it would be a simple blood transfusion like last time and back home, but maybe not. I hope they get the results of this test tomorrow as I am not keen on holding out till Monday. I somehow doubt they will get the results over the weekend.   Oh well at least my new employers have been good, they have changed my shift tomorrow so I finish at 2.30pm. It will give a little time with Alfie then we can go visiting.    RE: THE HOLIDAY…..  7 days to go. This time next week I should be in the hotel. I asked mum today if she wanted me to cancel, she said no, she wants some cool pictures of Per. Why is it she goes into hospital when I am planning on going away!!! In 1999 she was hospital recovering from the 2nd Kidney transplant when I went to Gothenburg!  I am exciting about going, just think a week on Monday and we’ll be coming back!!! Okay okay hold the negative thoughts right there….   Well sorry if this travel diary just bored you to death… but it will get better I promise!!!

       7 DAYS TO GO OR 1 WEEK!!!  Whoohooo I should imagine this time next week I would still be in bed as don’t have to be at the airport until 10.30am! Meanwhile Jackie should be sat in Terminal 2 at Manchester airport waiting to board her flight to Amsterdam! We are on different flights out to Sweden, but the same flight back! there is only an arrival difference of 3 hours so ain't no big deal!     So why am I up now… well it’s raining heavy here and so I go up to let Alfie out for a wee and okay to get a look at the Swedish newspapers… a little disappointed to say the least! Only seems Expressen are the ones with the photos worth looking at!   Well am aiming to get to work today, providing nothing goes wrong at the hospital and then we shall head up there later this evening to visit mum!   Alfie is still curled up fast asleep, in fact it’s so dull here I think I might head back to bed for a few hours! ;)

      Okay to cut a long story short, mum is in hospital, been totally exhausted for weeks with the renal failure. Yesterday when she went for a routine blood test and what should have been a short walk to the car park took forever as she was on the point of collapse. We have a course seen this before when she took ill about 18 months ago same symptoms as then.   Anyhow this morning, I decided to get a home visit from the GP, as she has no energy and is hardly eating also. She went back to bed.   Was just going out the door to go to work at 12.40pm, when the phone rang the GP, had the results back of the blood test yesterday and thought would be best to admit mum for a while to check her over. I think I could have told him this! Told us to stand by the phone and he would callback in 10 minutes with news of a bed. I had to call work to tell them I would not be in today, explained why… personally they either accept it or don’t, I don’t care my mum is my main concern in my life not some poxy job in a supermarket.    He did call back at around 1ish and we had to take mum upto A&E at Hope Hospital Manchester, where they would admit her from there if needs be. So packed some stuff and shot up there. Does not take long in the car 20 minutes at the most from where we live. A great doctor from the renal unit treated mum took all the information needed, did a routine chest x-ray and then we took her up to the ward on G3, a little like home sweet home! We came away then as not much we could do when they where treating her. To put it midly the transplant is failing and they are trying to prolong it for as long as possible. Her potassium levels are high, if they go any higher mum will be back on dialysis. She is anaemic as well, so more than likely she will have a blood transfusion also.   Aww she is going to be in hospital on her birthday……………….. But with a bit of luck she will be home next week.  Well it is now 7.22pm in Sweden, GYLLENE TIDER, will be hitting the stage soon. It’s raining in Halmstad also!

Jackie is being a soppy sod and won't write a few words for the diary, but tells me to say  "SHE DOES NOT HAVE A SUITCASE"  Jackie go charge the credit card now!!! She also  says she has ironed all the clothes but can't do anything without a suitcase!   DOH SILLY MARE    So day 9 is almost over... for now. I can say most stuff is done. Alfie is flaked out on the sofa, dreaming of rabbits I bet!  Am off to bedland myself soon.... thinking of those who are already in Halmstad now, and getting to see the prem tomorrow.. how cool they must be feeling now!   Was chatting to dear old Ted earlier on MSN, god that guy does worry over nothing...  TED I AM SURE YOU CAN TAKE YOUR CAMERA IN WITH YOU TOMORROW... DON'T WORRY!   Jeez your meeting Per, what's it matter if you get a photo or not.. store the memories on your hard drive (brain) you'll never forget 14th July 2004!

      Why is it the only day off I get I spend all the day running round like a blue arse fly! Well I can say I have got everything now for my trip, picked up the camera film today. I have 7 rolls, think that will be enough for 4 days (168 pictures) can always pick some more up when I am out there if needed be!  Been to pets @ home and stocked up on some new toys and lots of treats for Alfie. So even though I am having a guilt trip about leaving him on his own, he will be well fed!  See I am online again, when I really should be tackling some of that housework that needs doing. I will get started before the day is over  PROMISE!   The ticket arrived from Sweden yesterday for the Stockholm concert on the 23rd July. So means I can have my sitting ticket back for the show and Spyboo is going to be buying the standing one from me!  I don't have everything yet, still need to pick up a gold pen for the boys to use to sign my stuff and having my hair cut and coloured next week!  YAY!

      Well that is day 10 over with! almost. I think starting this blog now kind of gives you an idea of what I am like. The picture below was one I had taken with Per Gessle last summer on his Mazarin tour. I was one of the lucky winners to go backstage at the Stockholm concert. I went totally mind blank and this time round am determined that I will say more that I did last time.     Me thinks it will be Jackie that will faint this time!     Well I'll aim to keep you informed on the run up to my trip. You might find it a little boring that part  BUT  the good bits will come when I set off on my trip!  Keep checking back for updates....

      ... And it's nearly over... now I only have 3 shifts left to do at work as I wangled next Monday off also!  YIPPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  As you can see I really hate my job it sucks! but as people keep reminding me it's a job!   So welcome to those of you who are tuning in to my online diary, afraid it will be quite crap in the run upto July 22nd just about me, what I am doing and plans I have for the trip.  Hello to all my friends, Manda, Shydee, Purple, Suzy, Mum, Dad, and anyone else who's name I have forgot!   Trying to get Jackie to post a few words so you know who I am travelling with!   Tomorrow is my day off from work!  DOUBLE YIPPEEEEE  and I have tons of stuff to get done in the house and in town. Few more bits of last minute shopping for me to do. Remind me again am I going away for 4 weeks of 4 friggin days!  Little Alfie seems to be getting use to his new bed whilst I am out at work, bless him, he's good but damn me I am a cruel mother for leaving whilst I go to Sweden! Thankfully the old's are only across the road and will feed and walk him for me, in fact I doubt the little bugger will even miss me! Of course mummy will bring back lots of treats for my little baby. He will be spolit rotten!   If I just get to the end of this week, with a sane mind, I shall be a happy little bunny!

      Hello people, here is my online diary or blogger for my planned upcoming trip to Sweden in  10 DAYS TIME!    Yep I am off to Stockholm on Thursday July 22nd flying to Arlanda via Amsterdam for my 5 days trip. For once I am not travelling alone! Nope this little girl is going with a travel partner this time. Jackie the old mare is coming with me! I say old mare cause she is 5 years older. We are both going on the same day to Sweden but are travelling out on different flights. She will arrive 3 hours earlier that me, I hope she can find the hotel okay! I did directions for her!!!!   Jackie is going to make a great travel partner and we hit it off from the moment we met, must be that half scouse thing I have! We seem to have a lot in common! I think this trip will be extra special as I won’t be hanging around alone this time!   So this summer is the 25th anniversary tour of  GYLLENE TIDER  a band that has been around since the late 70’s and have a huge success in Sweden.   The band members are Per Gessle (lead vocals and guitar), Mats “MP” Persson (lead guitar), Anders Herrlin (bass guitar), Göran Fritzson (organ and piano) and Micke “Syd” Andersson (drums and percussion). Of course others will know Per Gessle as one half of Roxette, a group I have been following for 13 years!   So with 10 days to go and only 5 shifts at work we shall soon be off on our travels! I am starting my diary now in preparation of my trip to Sweden. So much to do and so little time left!   I spent most of yesterday sorting out the wardrobe and what I was taking for this important trip.        So what are we doing on our trip! Well we are seeing Gyllene Tider on tour for 2 concerts at Stockholm, Stadion on 23rd July and 24th July. Me and Jackie both got lucky as we won the contest being run through the official Roxette fanclub to go backstage and meet Gyllene Tider before the concert on the 24th. Needless to say  WE CAN’T WAIT!!!!  We have plans to see some Stockholm sights and also do plenty of shopping! Of course I look forward to meeting other fans from around the world!   I aim to keep this online diary updated throughout the trip, so check back to read all about the trip, the tour and the meet & greet with GYLLENE TIDER!    Roll on Thursday July 22nd!
