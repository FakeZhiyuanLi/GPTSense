      Ok heres my review of Halo, probubly the hottest game to sweep the planet since checkers!   So the good:  You get some kick ass guns in this game, from flame throwers, to plasma rifles, to grenades and sniper rifles! Perfect nOOb blasting cannons if you ask me!  Also you can ride in some amazing vehicles, like a banshee(hover bike) and freakin' tank! YES A TANK!!! Perfect for running over all those freakin nOObs that crowd our 1337 servers! wOOt!  The maps are crazy too peeps, mad hills, trees, forts and sniper positions (perfect for taking out all those god damned fucking nOObs!!!!!)   And the bad:  Personally I would like more characters to play as, theres nothing worse than looking the same as some nOOb that really suxorz!  Also I think they should come out with a few more vehicles (I've gotten pretty sick of running nOObs over in the TANK!!! DID I MENTION YOU CAN DRIVE A TANK!?!?!)  Anyways, the game is great, I give it a   9 out of 10 plasma shotgun shells   because I developed a blister on my thumb when I was playing it and later a girl saw it and called me gross and fat and ulgy and stupid and nerdy and gay and an acne ridden horrible excuse of a human being...    HALO 9/10 plasma shotgun shells    Next to come: Battlefield 1942   What 2 lQQk forward to:   1) Comic book reviews  (as fast as I can read them ; )! Or as fast as my mom buys them)   2) Movie reviews  ( as fast as I can watch them ; )! P.S. I can't watch R movies yet sorry :' ( ..... it soxorz)   3) Action figure reviews  (as fast as I can play with them ; ).....Donations always welcome, go to my Star Trek forums for more info!!)   4) Convention dates, comments and stories!      5) Costume Ideas for said conventions!      6) Much Much moreeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      7hIs h4s b33n 4 p(0)s7 bi    **l    teh nOOb b14S7(o)r !!!   411 h4i1!!!

At the next bus stop, 11 people get off and 9 people get on. At the next bus stop, 2 people get off and 2 people get on. At the next bus stop, 12 people get on and 16 people get off.

       thats right.  they do.  i can give you a lot of reasons.  But it would be a waste of time.  And time is precious.  time is more precious then gold.  time is a resource that is always dwindling, your always running out of time. You see, we only have a certain amount of this resource we call  time.  We only have so much time to do a project, to write a report, to finish a meal, to brush our teeth, to go to the bathroom, to read the newspaper, to watch tv, to look at things, to meet somebody, to mow the lawn, to take out the trash, to do chores, to make existential assertations, to drive to work, to put on your clothes, to run a race, to play stickball, to evade banas, to reach for the stars, to look down from a mountain, to read the newspaper, to ride your bike, to walk the dog, to make funny faces, to visit Finland, to eat a hamburger, to start a company, to make money, to have a family, to raise your hand, to talk in class, to make a presentation, to enjoy life, to not enjoy life, to beleaguer yourself by reading blogs, to make dinner, to make lunch, to make breakfast, to eat breakfast, to eat lunch, to eat dinner, to take a shower,  to watch  The Simpsons   yes, you have very little time indeed... so instead of wasting time by watching that trashy movie with Robin Williams, take from me and sieze the day

       First of all, I'd like to allude to the terrible spelling error that manifested itself in the fruits which came from the pen of one of my "blog buds", as I like to call them. All of us  true  bloggers know that it's kurdisee, not curtousy (and whoever spells it  courtesy  is just a simpleton idiot). Second off, I don't know what all this Phish buisness is but I don't like it one bit...all the psychedelic colors and stuff - I have a strong feeling it's just another reason for our deteriorating youth culture to get high...tsk tsk. Thirdly, I'd like to quote, and I think just in due time as it describes EXACTLY the way I feel right now, being that my boyfriend of    14     days just left me and I'm crushed, an Ashlee Simpson song off her hotttttttttttt nu cd dat I burned frum (notice how I didn't spell from with any less letters, but still made it seem cool!!!!?!?!?! yeah, it's hot, I know) KaZaA. "On a Monday I am waiting, tuesday I am fading, &amp; by wednesday I can't sleep. Then da fone rings, I can hear u. And da darkness iz a klear view cuz uve come to rescu me. " Awwwwwwww, Aaron! I still loves u babe! U N Me 4 Eva hun! Ashlee just always has the right words...well..that's all folks. Stay kewl, and remember: Smokey the Modern-speaking Grizzly Bear says, "Shut the fuck up and sit the fuck down and listen this good and shit about me talking bout fo' rest and fire and shit. Fuck...shit..." I don't know, maybe it was 'Be Smart About Fire Safetey' or 'You Too Can Prevent Forest Fires' but I'm pretty sure it was the first one. So that's the moral for today. Oh, and I forgot...My  Low-Carb Snack of the Day : Drywall...for an extra special treat, try topping it with a little water or low-carb air...but make sure if you splurge for the air, it's low-carb girls! Don't get too crazy! Peace out babez!  - The  Blogmeister

       This blog is for cool kids only and if they know whats good for them they'll shut up and not ask questions. So here are the rules:  1) No Questions 2) No Qwestions 3) No dissing "NicKelback" or "Good Charlotte"    4) Lack of Deletion of this entire blog is preferable  That about covers it. Feel free to post you own stuff on this blog. This screenname is Superblog2708 and the password is supercool. Feel free to post whenever about anything but remember the rooles. I mean rules. I meant rules, shut up. Oh yeah, Sk8r Boi'z are preferable but not a manditory requirement of the people that post.
