      Back from the Air Show - all in all it was a great day out. We had ice-creams, we buried people in the sand, we met up with friends, and nothing crashed. The only downside were the people walking around the beach like they owned the place. We'd set out our little area, just like everyone else. But every so often these people would just walk right in front of us, across our rugs and such, pulling buggies and huge bags, running over our toes. So we tried to stop them by digging a huge hole in front of where we were. It had  steep edges and most sensible people wouldn't have tried to drag all their worldly posession across it. But  still  people dragged prams, tents and bags through it. How stupid can you get? They didn't care if the hole was deep, they didn't care if they fell down trying to get across it. They were going to go through it. We just sat there and laughed silently. Clearly people weren't getting the message, so we put up surfboards, wrote GO AWAY in the sand and stood there like bouncers outside a club. And guess what? People just ran across. God I hate people sometimes.  Anyway, I couldn't find my camera so there'll be no pictues. Sorry >_

      Nope, not another quiz :P Anyway, I'm in a good mood at the moment - I'm off to the Lowestoft Air Festival tomorrow. Been going there for quite a few years there, and they just keep on getting better - lots of fast and expensive stuff :D Last years was pretty good - the Harrier jump-jet crashed into the sea at the end of it's "act" (read more about it  urlLink here ). If I can, I'll put up some pics in a few days. But I'm going to stop rambling now and give you some handy links:  urlLink Handy Info Link   urlLink Another Handy Info Link

       urlLink     Yeah, another quiz - this time, What Video Game Character Are You? I answered it honestly, and I'm Lara Croft. Should I be happy?

       urlLink      Mr Anderson...  Apparently I'm just like Agent Smith, which is strange because Hugo Weaving is my favourite actor. I think this describes me pretty well, (well, except for the porn bit) but then I wouldn't have minded being Hannibal Lector (Lecter?) either. I think his best line was "I am giving serious thought to eating your wife" which alone is worth a point in my book :D Wanna know what movie villian you are?  urlLink Take t3h Quiz!

      Hey hey hey! I just thought I’d open this place up so I could ramble on and make inside jokes to myself; tell you about my day, what I’ve been up to - that sort of crap. Feel free to look around, check out my profile, point and laugh. People actually reading this and listening to what I’m saying is not my #1 priority, but if you  really  are that bored, post a comment and tell me what you think. Or tell me to shut up. Whichever works for you…

      Damn, my character on EVE just got shot up. I was warping around, I left it for a minute. Come back and I'm just gone. Me and my ship no longer exist. DAMN! Ah well, back to the start for me...

      Quite a few things been happening in the last few days, posting on my Blog wasn't one of them. Sorry >_ Went to see King Arthur at the UGC with James. It was good in parts, but lost points with some poor acting and a plot that doesn't entirely make sense at times. Not to me, anyway. Also, whilst I was in town I got some blank DVDs so I can burn off some of the crap on my computer that I don't need but don't want to get rid of. You know how it's like :D Also, I bought Red Hot Chili Peppers - Live in Hyde Park too, which is the best damn album I've bought in years. If you like that genre of music, then go get it. Now! Then on Monday we went to the Alderburgh Carnival, which is held every year; it's a torch-lit procession down the main street, and then fireworks on the beach. Made for some really great night-time photo's. Just a pity I don't have a camera. Tuesday was my sister's birthday; 18 now, and we got here some tickets to a concert. My parents bought here a laptop too, to take to Uni. We went out and had a nice meal in the evening too, which was all good and nice. And right now I'm becoming slowly addicted to playing Eve Online. It's a MMORPG game; not really exciting or hugely fun but you can't help but come back and get your character a little further, or earn him some more money.  Anyway, I'm off to read some more online comics. What do I recommend?  urlLink Ctrl+Alt+Del ,  urlLink VG Cats  and  urlLink Applegeeks .

      Yeah yeah yeah, I know I haven't posted in a while here. Had a lot of work on over at my site, StyleSuites.com. Anyway, the last few days have been pretty boring. Went to see I, Robot with a friend; it's a pretty good, better than I expected it to be. Apart from that I've been waking up late, chatting until late. If all goes well, I'm going to go see King Arthur, get those blank DVDs I need and buy Red Hot Chili Peppers Live at Hyde Park tomorrow.  And where would we be without another quiz?   urlLink     Not bad, eh?

      Hehehe, came across this today in someone's signature. Well, I thought it was funny...     Also, I discovered an excellent little game based on The Matrix; BulletTime Fighting. Check it out  urlLink here  :)   Update:  I'm really starting to enjoy  urlLink this game , called Divine Intervention. It will take you a long while to load at first, but it's worth the wait ;)
