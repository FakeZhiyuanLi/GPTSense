      first post. got tired of waiting for m to build me the promised one. ah well. pretty amazing what you can get for free on line now adayz. So why do everyone flock to publishing their thoughts online? I mean, this voyeurist and exhibitionist streak in every single one of us can really be exploited!

      iDN conference is great great great. Totally inspiring. Esp when Devilrobots did their presentation yesterday in their barely understandable english but very very understandable japanese charm. Scream!  Cocolatte is the new place in place of the old milk bar next to gallery hotel. Very very nice decor and great music (jason loves it!)- hip hop. Must go there and hang out again!  ITs actually 6:45am in the morning and i had a very bad night tossing and turning so i finally got up, but nevertheless am feeling quite wonderful. I think its cos i've been hearing,s eeing and experiencing so many new things that i can't help but be cheered up by the limitless possibilities that my life allows. I can't imagine how when i'm depressed i feel this certainty that life cannot get any better, when there are a million different things i can do with my life if i choose to.   life is great!  jess  (hmmm so is the 6ish morning atmosphere. Reminds me of early morning church / school excursions to parks / beaches / picnics....sweet)

      sick sick just read the article about the american who was beheaded for show. I really really lost my appetite imagining the pain and horror he went through as the Iraqi SLOWLY sawed through his neck. And i am so tempted to feel such contempt for the people who did this and for their religion, but at the same time I cannot let myself forget the gross imbalance in media exposure that perhaps doesn't let us hear THEIR story at the same time.   Although such an act i think can be condemned in itself because it will NOT change anything and don't people realize that? It sure as hell is not going to encourage greater sympathy for their cause or ensure that their people will be treated better.   Its really sickening to hear things like that going on in the world, and although its far away from me i can't help feeling its not nearly far enough.   sometimes i'm happy not even opening the papers at all.   alright psyching myself now...dun let it spoil my day dun let it spoil my day.

      crap. Don't know how come i dragged myself out of bed so early, but now that i'm up can't really get back to sleep. Found a wonderful wonderful song and video here: http://www.bubble-squeak.com/site03/mo_hsh.html, guys go take a look  looking forward to idn at expo later and then clubbing tonite. Actually been trying in vain to detox but somehow drinking is such a huge part of my social life now i can't stop! Hmph and my friends said i wasn't part of the 'drinking core' when my liver is prob further gone than anyone else's. Maybe i need to find healthier activities.   well apparently there will be visible comets tom nite and sat so might head down to science centre to view them (although cant imagine who would want to go with me, ah well, prob have to go alone again...life of a geek)...guess that's healthy enough.   o god this blog is addictive, PLUS i'm so longwinded no one will ever bother to go through my blog again.

      Eyes got so whacked after staring at computer screen for 8 hours i went to watch an absolutely crappy show, Blood Brothers. The only good thing was the twist. And even that was not enough to make it worth it. But still that old falling apart cinema within walking distance of my place is still one of my favorite things. The rickety seats with stuffing coming out and the sick pink walls and the handwritten tix.   can't wait for the idn conference

      hmm actually had a great time last night. Had a great conversation with jason. Aaron took a great picture of me. And was so amused by the tussle over fags that jason and willie had. (oh god is it willy or willie). Plus me and gav got one pint free each! hehehehe that was really funny  its a beautiful sat morning cos i have the entire house to myself. have decided to work on my own website. am always excited by self promotion.   saw that clip of 2046 and goodness ok he's good but he's also stale. I liked in the mood for love cos of the acting greats, but zhang ziyi is so totally overrated! i thought she sucked in every movie i've ever seen her in. She has only two expressions. 1. cool, higher-than-thou oriental snob bitch face and 2. infuriated, indignant young little pussy-upstart face. argh can't stand her. No face can beat that of lucy liu. The greatest actors wear their emotions inside, not outside. I already can picture how 2046 will turn out. And honestly his style comes very templated, dunno how to put this right but its like the formula goes like this: slow as death shots stretched to their limit, graceful rhythm of the camera, characters who are always boiling simmering within but always trying not to show it, and bossa nova / jazzy / latin music that comes from god knows where.   note to jason: emily's not that hot. please dun try again. yucks.   will head down to zouk tonite to die in dave seaman's music, hopefully it will be a good set. The best set i've ever been to is still dave clark. Closest thing to orgasm i've ever had!!  here's hoping i can catch the two comets that are visible tonite.

      just hit me today. (actually has hit me many times already) At this point of time in my life, if i want anything to happen i gotta MAKE it happen.   its not like i'm still going along the education ladder, where everything is planned and expected. Now i really dunno wat to do with my life!  well they always say dare to dream and you might just achieve it. so my dream for now is...studying two years in ngee ann. earn enough money in the meantime. move to tokyo at the end of it. hehehehe  drinking at baden tonite! so need it.

      have survived an entire day on sweets and sushi. need sunshine.   so many things to do yet so many movies to watch too. Watched kate and leopold yesterday in the dark of my little room curled up on my double bed. Total crap. But hugh jackman is out of this world.   i hate being such an indecisive person, always vacillating between choices too scared to make the wrong choice. I wish i could just put my foot down and really fuck it.   the dumb thing about a blog is that you sometimes have to screen what you say cos of who might be reading it. But i shall say it anyhow.   Was supposed to go out with good friend past few days but just can't seem to summon up the will to abandon precious day hours to go out and just talk. I guess i dun give up on people until they seem to give up on me. I mean if i'm someone who fills up the spare hours you have then you can fuck it. Or someone who is suddenly a good friend again when its convenient.   Turns out i'm not that friendly after all. THe best kind of friend i can be is someone who will just be around no matter how much you fuck up as long as you still care for the friendship.

      hmm just went out with a bunch of friends today whose conversation really kind of alienated me and even depressed me abit. Talking about investing money, how much money other people are making, how much money it is possible for us to earn in six / seven years, how much money it costs to live in singapore. Oh god all very very real topics, in fact was thinking about it all the way home. Real issues that i've never wanted to deal with before. But at the same time so sad that there was nothing else we seemed to talk about.   then i realized that all my friends are moving into this hmm yuppie stage? (for lack of better word) and i feel so left behind, cos ya i think about bills but most of the time i'm thinking about new exciting things to do, how to really move forward in a career that is destined to pay little but yet so enticing and irresistible at the same time. i mean i have enough to think about without worrying about whether in five years time i'll be living in my own apartment wearing latest clothes partying with the most gorgeous people getting married while all my friends do!  and now i realize i am so old that i am facing the dilemma of balancing my idealism with cold hard reality and its really a chore.   ah well.   guys go check out www.ukshowreels.tv. Some of the most hilarious ads there and tons of videos to keep you occupied in that small little dank office i know we're all stuck in.

      Freshly inspired out of the really great idn conference. Totally enjoyed the stuff people from ILM and WETA showed PLUS very inspired by the quiet elegance of Alan Chan and his incredible creativity.   Troy sucks. Fell asleep. ANd i haven't fallen asleep in a movie for a damn long time. I think the last time was when i was watching a collection of Ed Wood's movies.   In a great great general mood past few days. Seeing new things and experiencing new things helps you to remember that life is full of limitless possibilities and if life sucks its our own fault.    ahhhhh. think should go and catch the lotr exhibition soon.   oh and comets are apparently visible from singapore these few days with binoculars. Although have no idea where to find them.

      spent some time on http://maddox.xmission.com/ as recommended by willy. Really quite funny stuff. Apparently wat makes a blog interesting now is not whining or pensive thoughts but being a real bad ass and dissing everything in a controversial manner. But really really quite entertaining.   ALSO have spent a lot of time on www.harrypotter.com playing games. But ah well. Pathetic sunday.   ALSO have rewatched Return of the King and cried buckets at the end. Next up: girl with pearl earring.   am starting to feel my life is pathetic. I wanna be out there in the sun riding my bike! Sigh at least two more months to go.

      hmmm friend just commented that it is sad that we are so blog - crazed. but i love it. makes me feel like we're in touch everyday, so we can really cut the small talk and get straight to the beer. heheh. doesn't matter if its whining or thoughts or pictures. guess they're just extensions of the kind of people we are.   today feels like a wonderful saturday, since i allowed myself to sleep in cos i had a really long night.And woke up to rain. and watched Monsters Inc with my sis with whom i seldom talk but who is a wonderful wonderful person.   and you know the feelin that you usu get when you're working: you love wat you've done but when you wake up the next morning and look at it again it looks like crap. but i woke up looked at wat i did last nite and was still pretty pleased, so i guess thats a good start.   have a few friends who are going big time on network marketing or MLM schemes. and yeah the figures are pretty impressive, and i guess if money is the ultimate goal then its worth looking at. but i cant shake my belief that work should a major source of joy in our lives and without the ability to do wat we love even if its for peanuts we'll really be very deprived.   and i just discovered that on mornings when i actually bother to make my bed up i feel better. cos i live in an absolute pig sty but i also live by the principle of 'organized mess'. means i know where everything is.   also good mood booster? taking five mins for simple meditation. its really interesting but generally across cultures and religions and beliefs, this concept of 'mindfulness' has emerged as a key to better living. Its basically learning to be more aware of yourself, both physically and mentally. And can also translate to a determination to live in the present moment and not dwelling on the past or constantly hurrying towards the future. Which is wat everybody does on the street you kinda notice it. Everyone's walking really fast but their eyes are glazed over cos they're thinking about wat they're gonna do next, where they're going and whether they're going to be there on time. And you see people always wishing for the train to move faster, for the queue to move faster, for the traffic to move faster, for the elevator to come faster.   its like wat struck me in the actors handbook that we were encouraged to read for sharen liu's class (can't remember the title), where it said that the key to great acting was 'being in the moment', feeling and perceiving and reacting to watever the character is experiencing at that moment. and i've always been struck by how infrequently i actually am in the moments in reality. And i guess that's similar to mindfulness or self awareness.   its a damn long blog and prob everyone has stopped reading by now, writing is just so cathartic!  also an interesting concept is that of observing your own thought process, observing wat thoughts surface in your mind, but also distancing yourself and watching these thoughts as though they were clouds floating across the sky, without judging them or reacting to them. And that gives you a clue to wat you are all about. And as Aristotle said (shit or is it Socrates?), a life unexamined is not worth living.   guess i belong to the category (as willy put it) of bloggers who write only pensive thoughts. But i guess thats what i'm mainly about too.

      am writing for the sake of writing. am in no shape to come up with any coherent thoughts cos mr jim beam has driven them all away. Also may have sent some very questionable messages to some people but will deal with them later. The upside is that Mr Jim Beam has provided crucial creative inspiration for a project i'm working on. Yippee.

      on days like these i wanna scream bloody murder and cut myself. why do i have such a low threshold of shit that people give me. but i have an even lower threshold of dealing with the shit that i've done. i am so totally my own worst enemy i sometimes pity people who have to put up with me. always the nagging little voice says i should run away.   hmm reminds me of my days in rgs where it was cool to cut pictures in your own arm.   bad day made worse by throbbing headache. think i'll go watch a movie to cheer myself up. nothing like a disaster movie to make you feel things aren't so bad really.

      am totally hungover. accidentally (i swear, really accidentally) drank too much last nite. TOld myself ok i can only have two pints tonite so i did (and that nice cute waiter at siem reap smiled at me like, 11 times!!, and brought me ice water. FAINTED.) but then got called to meet another friend and so i said wat the heck and i downed an entire pint of BARONS and THEN had half an asahi to quench the thirst.   fucking amazing i managed to wake up to go for my interview at mda at all. (for grant to study) and stupid interviewers asked me stupid questions like who's my fav directors like wat the fuck has that gotta do with the grant. and becuase my brain was (and still is, ladies and gentlemen), drowned in a beer smog, i could only think of two directors who i totally hate!!!! i actually said roystan tan and wong kar wai!!!!! so painful. well their work is good, really, but just doesn't mean anything to me. argh.   work problems. am having a really hard time working with someone and trying to motivate him and myself at the same time. i just have a lot of enthusiasm for this project i'm doing but apparently its not infectious enough. feels like i'm dragging a stone everywhere with me.   ok note how whiny i am hence how long this blog is. my resolution: stop drinking. really. stop.

      am indignant cos my friend said my blog was boring!!! Boring!!!  but i guess when i am truly at peace with myself and have nothing to whine about i'll have no need for a blog!  This meditation thing is really good. Very simple, but i am more prepared to face the day.

      work is good!  had a really fulfilling day finishing up a lot of things. Feelin all drained but full of satisfaction!  Today tried meditating for the first time and realized how truly restless my brain is. Its harder than i thought trying to clear my mind and concentrate! But somehow i feel that spending that 5 minutes truly trying to be alone with myself is the beginning of something that could be truly enriching. Definitely worth a try.

      Am re reading one of my favourite books of all time 'who moved the stone' by frank morison. I love it because it is such a bold psychological analysis that postulates a lot of details in the episode of Jesus' capture, death and resurrection, but which makes a lot of sense. And it is written like a mystery unfolding and i can read it several more times. Also the amazing thing was how the author started out a skeptic but at the closing of the book he became a firm believer in Jesus' resurrection.   had a horrible nightmare yesterday night and when i woke up was surprised to find that the first thing i did was to pray. just to be delivered from this mess that is my life rite now!  here's my booklist:  1. zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance 2. who moved the stone 3. sophie's world 4. dream of scipio  5. cosmos 6. knowing god 7. creating motion graphics  yay!

      am so taken with pippen's (or is it merry's) song in return of the king. the lyrics are beautiful and he has a beautiful voice. he is singing this while the riders of rohan are being sent to their death by their willful steward. such a beautiful scene.   home is behind the world ahead there are many paths to tread through shadow to the edge of night until the stars are all alight mist and shadow cloud and shade all shall fade all shall fade

      had great fun last night with the guys. last night was a three pint night for me and i'm glad we went to wine bar...cos its been ages since i went near a club. And the teochew muay was fucking excellent!!!!!   i'm sorely tempted to buy xbox and get live. but that might mean i'll become one of those pasty wide eyed gamers who live the better half of their lives inside a game. But the green box is calling! argh.   read about the conspiracy theory re berg's execution. The whole bloody thread was 83 pages long! and never had the stomach to watch the video so can't really see for myself if the evidence is substantial. but one thing is for sure, the people on the thread are really damn stupid and childish. some guy even guessed that the guy who started the thread was michael moore! hmmm. thats an idea  am feeling happy today because of an excellent last night and also cos my favourite library is reopening after renovation. I know it sounds silly but there are few places in singapore that i really love cos they have open skies, few people and feels just like home.

      i am blown away by harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban. Because i know the first two very well, i can immediately notice the differences in style and structure that is the work of alfonso cuaron.   its incredibly fascinating to try and notice how he creates a certain pace or mood by the way he shot the film and by the way he selected the steps in which the story progresses. little little things but in the end the effect is noticeably there and its so much better than the first two. i love dissecting why or how he chooses to do a shot a certain way cos everytime i pick up the camera and i try to think of how to cover a particular thing i realize how limited my filmic vocabulary is cos i immed think of getting the most 'complete' coverage instead of thinking of how i can translate a certain desired mood or idea. its not just about black and white, the music or very obvious shit tha tyou hope can cover your asses after its all done. really very good.   girl with a pearl earring is very beautiful. Every single frame looks like a painting and i think about how in post production do they really achieve that kind of colour. And colin firth is a dream.   had a sudden frightening vision of my losing my sight due to watching too many movies and spending too long hours in front of computer.

      wow interesting insight of the day. The next big trend from blogging is for people to recreate entire websites using files from all over the internet. And copyright will no longer be an issue because everybody and their mum would be doing it and thus would be impossible to catch. The entire web will become just a huge collection of text, images and videos and media and complete standalone websites will cease to exist. Which is why HTML will make a huge comeback!

      last night was a blast. poor gav i hope he manages to do his ippt alrite. am bloody amazed at how much he drank! i think i got high just looking at him drink.   am also bloody amazed by a lot of things. that GRACE asked me to go cheong next week (hehehe) and that we actually missed aaron! it was just so weird that he wasn't there, but also amazed at last nites turn out.   velvet not so good though somehow the music manages to wake you up from your drunken stupor and every body in the crowd dresses the same!   can't believe i have to go help out at a barbeque. but i realized that if you get hung over, just drink and drink again and then the hang over will be gone...almost. amazing!   still can't find anyone to give me a kitten. think i'll have to go and check the drains.

      my life is settling into a sort of monotony which is nice but scary at the same time. its the whole habit of wandering around alone, doing whatever i feel like and not letting anything get to me. I used to be that way say i dunno five years ago? I dunno if i can describe it as carefree, but it sure beats always feeling frustrated about things beyond my control.   but i can't help thinking to myself...what was it i always wanted to achieve by age of 24? and wat was it i imagined my life to be like at 24?   i think when i was 17 i envisioned that me as a 24 years old would be holding an office job (dun ask why), walking around all day with all done up hair, nice office clothes, and having a date every other day. now i guess you can't really lay down any rules for how you wanna grow up, or grow old. so i may imagine myself as a 50 year old, a glamourous mother who looks 30 and has infinite patience but i suppose that would be wildly off track as well.   why do we stress ourselves out so much about leading meaningful lives? (ok maybe just me). i guess those people i know who truly lead meaningful lives have a sort of quiet calm and peace around them. and that stupid irritaing question that keeps buggin me: would i reach the end of my life and regret living it this way? And i guess the only answer to that isi would truly regret it if i spent half my life worrying about that stupid question.   so all these miscellaneous and insane thoughts out of the way, am pretty pleased with myself for coming up with some great designs for a project i'm working on, and also happy to have discovered solutions in aftereffects for this thing i wanna do.   hmmm i really cannot recall what kind of life i had before i had a computer proper.   oh and also very excited and happy. Jurong library has reopened and it is gorgeous and HUGE and has a huge collection of books on film, tv, art and shit. wonderful. reminds me of roald dahl's book...the one about the little girl shit wat was her name? martha, marsha something like that. she was such a little thing like five or six years old and she read an entire library and was brilliant. damn wish i had started younger.   am trying to find some space to upload this great great video, but apparently dun have access to my own server yet. damn dumb. anyway its all about girls in bikinis, damn hot pants and drills. Yes DRILLS, and all sort of workshop tools. its really great, so watch this space.

      amazing, just watched exterme make over on tv, and it was actually quite painful to watch. it's easy to rant about how we women are under such pressure now to artificially alter ourselves, but really everything at the end of the day is undebatably about choice.   but it was actually quite funny cos one of women came back looking great only cos of her clothes and weight loss and makeup. and they close-uped on all their friends and relatives one by one and they all seem to be thinking 'now i need plastic surgery', and its quite funny.   i resolve to stay out of the sun man.

      woke up today hung over and hating myself for doing this to my own body. new resolution: start learning how to be a health freak (you know the kind who frantically jogs everyday and pick at lettuce leaves and are daintily disdainful of all the junk food their friends eat. yuck). do NOT want to have to deal with a fucked up body in ten years time.   but anyway had a FANTASTIC time last nite. almost fell through but in the end everyone came and it was really just fun. i mean until 4 am i still felt like i could go on forever, but of course everyone was like dead or hungry. really great, met a lot of great people too, and yes in case anyone is interested, gavin DID go....and no it is NOT all about him....sheesh!  so today is detox day...but mentally and physically...must chill and do no lifer things.

      mood today: sad about the whole state of the world. things just keep getting bloodier and with all these kidnappings and executions and conspiracy theories i cant help but wonder when things will start spilling over to our side and then we'll have to deal with the horrible reality of it all cos its in our faces.   guess life is always about perspective, and things are always so different depending on which angle you are looking at them from. but then how the hell do we know which perspective we are supposed to take? i guess thats what it means by 'worldview', like how i have had a christian worldview for the first half of my life and now am rapidly needing another one. like just a way to explain why things are like that, and how to make the best decisions everyday.   damn why do i never have normal exciting stuff to talk about.   well ok lets see last nite went out for drinks with couple of friends and found out that bribing in business occurs more frequently than people think. and i guess it shows how ignorant i am that it came as a shock to me, i mean he made it sound like we were living in fucking china.  also really want to move to new york and live in an apartment with friends after going through two seasons of Friends. but hmph dun even like america anymore.    am also bummed cos am not getting any closer to getting my bike licence and thinking that the phobia is going to set in soon again since i'm so out of touch. i mean honestly travelling at 40km/h within the bloody circuit my mind still keeps having visions of myself skidding across the road and having a car (travelling at 20 km/h !) running over my legs (thanks aaron) until i am nothing but a bloody mess. well at least my trusty helmet will protect my brains so i can still be a paraplegic. (shit did i spell that correctly?)  ok i think mood for today is actually morbid.

      ok i am only writing this cos i know prob about only five people in the entire world reads my blog.   just found out my elder sister broke up with her boyfriend of donkey years and i feel so sad yet so encouraged, cos she is just taking so much initiative in her life and being so strong about it. and i KNOW if i suddenly became single at 27 i'll just start to panic. and suddenly i feel so much love for her, cos she is incredible.   also my younger sister wrote this: faith is believing in what you can't see, and the reward is seeing what you believe in. and i know she prob took this from somewhere, but she is this wonderful wonderful person even though at the age of 14, and i keep thinking i am so glad i have such beautiful sisters.   tho now that i mention i REALLY have a prob of expressing my feelings. i mean i have never once told them i really love them, and honestly can't see the day that i actually will. but i do. i bet they have no idea how much influence they have in my life.   could be the asahi though.

      i really need some fuzz therapy today.   life is dumb. i am dumb. i recently told a friend that he liked to stress himself out of proportion, but then i realized how exactly the same i am. just to show how stressed i am...  three nights ago i dreamt that i was an astronaut, got stranded on venus and was the only survivor on the planet after an alien virus destroyed all my crew.  two nights ago i dreamt that i was trapped in a house with friends and we were all infected by a deadly virus and decided we had to shoot each other so as not to carry the virus outside.   last night i dreamt that i was stuck on a sinking ship in the middle of the sea in the middle of winter and my choices were to drown or become a prisoner on a taiwanese ship.  apparently a friend said that if you keep dreaming about your own death it means you are losing control in your own life. and that is so bloody right. but how do you regain that control? and why do women need so much self help stuff?

It is just truly such an amazing book. Although am quite brain dead now.   Next up: Cosmos!

      new revelation: guess i must be really dumb cos i have to keep relearning life's lessons over and over. as though there is only this tiny room in my brain and stuff keeps leaking out and i have to keep putting them back in.   realization of today: i should never treat people the way they treat me, but the way i hope to be treated. i know i know its a rephrasing of biblical teaching, but its really different when you look at the same nugget of wisdom through experiences you have just been through and are going through. and i think it really takes a lot of strength to not return someone's ill treatment of you. and i guess it just boils down to the most important thing: the kind of person i want to be, or i would be proud of being.   and if i really think about it, i dun really like the person i am right now, and i want to be alot better. a lot stronger, a lot more self control, a lot more holding back my tongue and temper, and a lot more motivated, a lot more action, a lot more gusto, a lot more excited, inspired and open minded. and a lot less time spent wondering why other people just cant get it right and a lot more time spent getting it right myself. also a lot less whining.   i really think modern life philosophy is full of shit. i believe that one can only live for oneself but its very different from being selfish. i know people who live for only themselves. everything they do and every person they meet only serve to satisfy some part of their own desires. yes even doing good things sometimes. but it takes a lot of trial and error to realize that sometimes being on the so called losing end is what would actually really fill up that endless void inside us. yes sometimes by losing we actually win big time.   writing is really cathartic but at the same time kind of fills u up i mean just writing what i wrote just now made me a great deal more determined.   read this article in sunday's life about a guy with HIV and his life, and was really saddened. i mean one min a high flying, rich gay, and next moment, shunned, poor and hopeless. and who can say that won't happen to anyone of us? and wat would i do? if i didn't believe suicide is a sin i prob would kill myself.   alright but the best bit of my day so far has been:  1. finally getting the logging and batch capturing in premiere to work properly with my camera 2. writing this blog

      have started school and classes are actually not bad. of course there's the usual rigid lecturer with damn kuai lan face and who gives all of us shit about smoking and punctuality and stuff...but actually have met a few interesting people. Am still considering dropping it though cos i really am itching to be out there working.   crazy fun drinking last nite with all three groups of diff friends:  1. auds and gang - investment bankers, corporate, professional 2. gav and gang - crazy alcoholics 3. kirsten and gang - new friends from school who are really fun and some quite cute!  woke up hungover and a little depressed. Someone mentioned that depression is simply the inability to have hope in the future and its quite true sometimes. I really have to work at it to become more positive and open more doors for myself.

      Thus closes one chapter of my life and i'm moving on to the next.   Although...was tossing and turning the whole night cos i think i drank too much last night. So its unearthly 7am now i'm hungover, dead tired, and really freaking out about the idea of starting school today. So i decided to give myself a treat. Maybe i'll skip today. haha. Do NOT want to meet everyone for the first time in my haggard state.   today i need to focus on a few things:  1. i am a completely free individual  2. shit things happen to everyone and i must and i can learn to accept them 3. being happy is a decision 4. too much alcohol is no good 5. thinking too much about certain things is a waste of brain cell life 6. life is full of intriguing possibilities but we often forget to look 7. being strong is a decision 8. find a job 9. sleep as much as i can

             had a great night except for some really irritating moments.  went out with auds and elaine (my air stewardess fren) and had a great time at boat quay. of course they met loads of new people including the owner of the place which was really nice, the singer at the place, who had an amazing voice though hes quite young, and this really nice guy from australia.  &nbsp;  am still pissed off when i think about it though, how some people can be so fucking hostile or narrow minded about certain things that they cannot even extend basic courtesy to someone. Yes its all good and fun to bitch and whine about stereotypes but it is so stupid to not even consider the possibility that people are not wholly defined by stereotypes! just gotta say felt really ashamed of the way my friends treated my guest yestreday and i'm glad i just left or else i would have blown up and died.  &nbsp;  thing is not that i'm not guilty of that sometimes, but if i've learnt nothing through my 24 years one thing i've learnt for sure is that most of the time when i'm really&nbsp;stubborn about something i usually turn out to be wrong. i mean so many people have turned out to be really great, interesting and good people even though i stereotyped them from the beginning. but give us a chance to talk and its really uplifting to realize that fuck everyone is the same and share the same humanity.  &nbsp;  i'm going on and on i know but am actually getting pissed off again just thinking about it. i mean last nite i looked beyond all the pretentiousness and vanity and ditziness and i actually saw someone who needed attention, was insecure and wanted to fit in so badly, that in the end i was really glad to spend some time hanging out with her.  &nbsp;  now that thats out of my system. still feel good about last nite cos i spent time for other people, and doing other people even a little good just by being there makes the whole nite meaningful.  &nbsp;  although did just read article on liver disease cos am getting really worried about the excessive drinking, so i resolve to cut down a lot. although shit have to go tonite again.

       few things can make this moment more perfect. its raining in the morning, with the wet rain smell waking me up...laid in bed to read...and now sitting at comp blasting filterheads, working on script ideas, and having an ultra fresh texas five...and a couple of hours will go meet my new production team...its always exciting starting to work with a new bunch of people...before all the discontentment sets in of course...but so many new possibilities...but what makes this moment totally good is that despite having nightmares right now i feel totally carefree and in control over my life...    &nbsp;  also am starting to feel useful again cos my gf just called me and was crying and i apparently made her feel a lot better...hell think i'm really getting good at these comforting sessions!  &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      seriously got high on music last night again. I love nights like that. Little alcohol (or watered down cos they're free), and three hours straight of dancing to mind blowing music. Really fantastic night! OF course missed my morning class but it was worth it.   daniel yun (CEO of raintree pics) came to my school to give a seminar and am now so seriously inspired. every now and then i need something to poke me really hard to come out of this little world i live in and stand back and look at the big picture of the whole new world i want to build for myself, and then see whether i am actually on the way to getting there.   anyhow not sure if i've already posted this but i got the mda grant for my course, so its a big sigh of relief cos i dun have to skulk around guiltily trying to starve and scrimp.   and WHAT'S UP with those gross pictures they are putting on cigarette boxes???? i mean honestly its a really great strategy cos it really freaks me out but am not totally up to quitting yet. now it just means i have to buy a cigarette case or colour it out every time i buy a new box. sigh.

       its 430 am and i'm surprisingly awake cos just had a great conversation with one of my fav guys...talked about normal stuff but somehow i feel more uplifted. its the sheer fact of having people around me to interact with that really makes life better in little ways.     &nbsp;  my theory has always been that at any given point in my life there are only a few people i really treasure and will go to any lengths for...people who somehow just have that chemistry with me...and it doesn't take very long to build a relationship like that...could be a few weeks or years...    &nbsp;  tho people lately keep telling me that i have a very dao face, and that im not diplomatic enough...and i guess i do know the advantages of being able to fake it sometimes...so my new resolution is to train my face to not show what i am feeling...altho its really a lot harder than it sounds...    &nbsp;  first step i'm going to take towards better anger management: do more blogging

       happy happpy moment of today: finally bought myself a new game: prince of persia!!! honestly i am still a warcraft worshipper but am so excited at having a new world to explore. of course have been playing all night and neglecting my homework and work tee hee hee. luckily have forced myself to stop. but will prob start again later. oh hell.     &nbsp;  am totally into filterheads now...really great music...my room sounds like a club 24/7 now...    &nbsp;  bad side to today was fighting with people i work with AGAIN. stupid stupid politics stupid stupid misunderstandings. i wish i could say i was easy going but unfortunately i'm really quite a pain in the ass cos i get too hung up. just realized last nite and thought it through...i think i need anger management counselling man. But newly resolved, not to let it take control of me. Even i get scared when i totally lose it.     &nbsp;  goo goo dolls: '..and you bleed just to know you're alive.'

       had a fucked up saturday but a great sunday...so slow and relaxed...went to my friendly neighbourhood cinema and watched two movies in a row...just me and my kfc nuggets...    &nbsp;  have to admit that im quite obsessive cos i just watched spiderman for the third time! and each time it still makes me laugh and hold my breath! i must say i think its a perfect movie...ya its not deep or artsy but its so human and entertaining. ok maybe just cos i'm obsessive.     &nbsp;  on the other hand, arthur really sucks. so i hope nobody else goes and watches it.     &nbsp;  and here comes the hard part, trying to write a script and come up with a story that works. narrative filmmaking is so hard, but i get more and more inspired everyday to really try and make it, i must say its like remembering why i chose to be in the media in the first place. Yeah freelancing in video is good money, and the business of tv and production is interesting, but nothing is more intriguing than imagining that one day i'll be able to make a really compelling movie.   &nbsp;

       really enjoy moments when i truly just let go, not worry about wasting time or paying attention to questions in my head. Just sit and let my consciousness exist without trying to do anything. Absorb the late night air watch the sky grow light.       today am quite spaced out. also quite thrilled by idea of spending night doing things i have been putting off. also hope to design something today and flex my brains a little. Write a little. Edit video. Read. Surf.       last nite i did three very good deeds and it makes me feel good still. Number one i helped to edit a video from crap to something vastly better. Number two i helped get a group of people together and everyone had fun.Number three i let myself totally relax and just sit waiting for daybreak in a park.       Detoxed today by sleeping and watching vertigo which blew my mind away. Really really brilliant. Now can't wait to come up with my own script which will be due for production in about two months.

      how sad is this...two years later and am still sitting in editing room expectedly until late at nite (unfortunate thing is editing suites here close zhun zhun at 930 so no thoning)...  am so stoned now from sleeping two hours cos after a power nite of partying some idiot had to wake me at 7am to CHAT.   also very stressed now as have to rush between school, project, and comforting best friend who has just broken up with bf cos he caught her cheating. also supposed to go talk to the said ex boyfriend which is really very weird but i'll do my best. think being aunt agony really fits me but only when i'm in the mood.   right now am so in the mood to do something crazy and fun. feeling my high of the past few weeks starting to come down and am looking for new stuff to do.   obviously can tell i am fucking tired from incomplete and incoherent sentences. but writing cos waiting for editor to redigitize footage for online edit. yes i no longer have to work the damn machine myself just sit there and point point.   watched la nuit et le brouillard today and broke down seeing all those bodies in concentration camps during ww2, looked down at myself, and saw how fleeting my own life is and how i am nothing but skin a nd bones and what the fuck am i doing with my life. i think its the pain of coming out of my heonistic period and returning to that incessant question of how i want to use my life, and what i can do in my own small way for the world. also want to quit smoking cos do not want to die before making positive change to world.   fingers now too frozen to write. supposedly editing rooms ALWAYS have to be fucking cold cos i think avid ships with instruction on box: keep at temp of 18 and below.   not making sense. fingers cramping.

       sometimes life is worth living just cos of the weird and wonderful people you meet. last nite through half asleep drunken stupor was listening to all my friends talking about meaninglessness of everything and realized that for me the simple truth remains that maybe the reason for our existence is no more than a lucky opportunity for us to enjoy this world. So its not what we can do with our lives, but how we appreciate the fact that we have them.     &nbsp;  last night was totally drama mama (k. if you are reading this, i blame you but still love you!) ..with friends playing major prank on me, also involving about six litre bottles of heinies (yes was at kopi tiam woo hoo!!!), also involving pissed off friends, moody friends who wandered off, walking in straight lines, boxing matches with a guy twice my size, slapping hands game in which i punched him and bled his lip (feel so fucking guilty) and a little bottle of wine to finish me off.     &nbsp;  ahhh yes life is quite wonderful cos despite all the shit things that happen i would still say last nite was great...    &nbsp;  today will play prince of persia, do some work and enjoy being alone.

       yay! am finally awake and ready to enjoy the world again!      (warning: very long blog ahead. To abort, close webpage and get a life.)      Sigh k msged last night from tioman and described such a beautiful nite whilst i was standing at wine bar in a relentless cloud and a perpetual smoke cloud. Will spend week thinking of way to escape on my birthday, find a little place to go to, get away for a while. hope it happens for me!      i am constantly enthralled by the lives of other people whom i care about...so full of stories.       happy that last nite went out with the old school gang and everything turned out alrite and we just had fun again. Dunno why but suddenly just full of good feelings for everyone around me.       i guess i have forgotten how much i treasure my life. And after that scare yesterday i remind myself not to do anything i will regret. Cos the hardest thing to learn about living is that time can never be turned back and we make every single decision only once and will have to face the consequences that naturally follow. So every step must be taken with care.       Wow, i really must be growing up.       Friday the 13th...am trying to recall how my birthdays have been spent.       Age 21 i remember i was in a chalet with candles and a durian cake and the next morning i was back there making out.       Age 22 was drinking at Sugar and got into a car accident which kinda fucked up my back till today.       Age 11 was sitting at the top of the stairs in my house furiously scribbling in my diary and counting down...very sad that my special day was rapidly running out.       Age 18 (or was it 19?) had a very sweet birthday full of surprises planned by then bf which included a hidden cake in a restaurant along boat quay.       Thinking back i really miss certain people in my life. Kelvin first and foremost, it still hurts that he won't even talk to me after so many years. Maggie, who is somewhere in states altho thought she was supposed to be back. My old church friends who were full of encouragement and good fun, althou there wasn't complete empathy. Feels like my life was split in half and i have been two different people in one life.       Oh no very nostalgic and sentimental now. Also listening to Toto.       It really was so different then. I didn't hang out with anyone who was n't from my church, and i guess i basically spent my teenage years there.       Crazy memories like lying on the road in the middle of church in the middle of the night to look at stars with Kangling (also vaguely remember huge tub of ice cream finished between us). Studying through the night with them in a small little room that you have climb narrow winding stairs to get to. Chalets, barbeques. Endless meetings, aspirations, ideas. All night bible and prayer camps. Researching and writing a newsletter. Writing letters and small cards to encourage people. Playing volleyball after sunday service every week without fail. Crying because i was so moved by a message or something in the Bible. I wish i could have that life back just for a while. Not too long, dun think i could permanently be like that. But just for a little while.       ok ok snapping out of nostalgic mood now. Just grateful for the chance to be alive. I really have nothing to complain about.       Am getting good at cultivating detachment to things around me. I dun really think its a once bitten twice shy thingy, just that i tend to get over attached to certain things and then i turn into this scary person that i hate. I will always remember this verse in the Bible that says: a person with no self control is like a city with no walls.       Christianity makes the most sense to me. The Bible reads like a fairy tale, but its sad for people who can't see beyond the stories. It has created a whole life philosophy for me, and its like once you see the world through the right glasses, you'll be able to deal with whatever comes.     There is nothing really mythical or mystical about it. Everything is very logical, rational, and in fact some things are too amazing to be understood. I can always remember the feeling of being awed by the realization that there are things beyond my ability to understand. And there are things that when you DO understand they are quite beyond words to express. LIke right now.      Must work on script now. Really excited by the development and can't wait to get back to school.

      have unrepentantly gone to club despite being half dead, and it was so surreal an experience. Anyhow am ready to die now, but not before i have to explain that the matter that my friend brought up has been resolved, and i am too relieved that the problem i anticipated was not existent in the first place.  Ok have decided to start a new blog cos having people reading my blog restricts my freedom to write actual things about what actually happen (refer to incoherent first paragraph as reference). So i shall find one little corner of the INternet and write everything that happens to me in detail.  was fun tonite though...expect i shan't wake up till monday...nahhhh i know i'll be up before noon tomorrow...how fun!

       have slept 2 hours in two days, of which i spent 12 hours having lessons, 7 hours having a shoot, and the rest mainly hanging in kopi tiams with friends. Am running on pure unadulterated adrenaline now, but will prob collapse soon, hopefully not before i can finish writing this blog.       Friend has brought matter to my attention and it has fully overwhelmed me now that i have finally returned home and have time to think. But refuse to be cowed into paranoia until i have had a few hours to clear my befuddled mind.

       had a wonderful last nite...the kind you wake up from and laze in bed just replaying it over and over again. Ran into Jas and realized how long i haven seen everybody.       Next week's my bday already and its finally a Friday the 13th. Every year its a big deal to me, time to start thinking up new resolutions and perhaps even stick to them. But man, 24. I honestly couldn't have imagined myself at 24 and i dunno if i'm disappointed or happy that i turned out the way i am. Ah well, guess the journey never ever ends.       am quite tired but body still running on adrenaline and nicotine, therefore shall work on script until i feel intelligent to blog again. sheesh what a wasted post.

       wish i had a much much bigger window. The kind that stretches from ceiling to floor. So i can sit here watch the lightning. Sky is husky blue now but pink along the horizon and the lights are gaussian blurred in the rain.       Always been a childhood dream to capture lightning on photograph. I remember when i was about ten or eleven i stood at this small little window in my room for about an hour hoping to be quick enough to catch the lightning with my compact.       Resolve to finally do it properly.       just bounced ideas off a friend and feel much more enthused about the script. Must flesh out characters and then put them together and step back and see how they interact to create the story.       at same time am du lan with people who dua me. This is definitely the last freaking time.       but now sitting in my familiar seat, cigarette in hand, a too small pic of the storm outside of my window, energized by semi philosophical sms discussion, and tons of things waiting to be created inside my comp, maybe it doesn't really matter after all.       the greatest source of hope for me comes from knowing i am always capable of change. Read that somewhere but has stuck with me ever since.

       i love the feel of sundays.Things are slower, the day seems longer and everyone just walks at a more leisurely pace. Sundays are for watching two movies in a row, for taking slow drives, for sitting at computer creating things.     have spent much of the past two days dreaming up the story i have to tell in my next project. So have been morbidly continually asking myself the question: 'why DID she kill herself? ' And startling to realize how much inspiration i can get from things that have happened or things i have heard. Hmm guess stories dun have to come from real life but ideas certainly do.     I, Robot is pretty alright, better than i expected with great action sequences. Upon recommendation of friend, will watch a Kurosawa film tomorrow. But its on VHS so really gotta wait till i'm in the mood. Great thing is school has a wonderful collection of movies.     Will work on revamping digital portfolio.
