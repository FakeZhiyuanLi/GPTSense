       urlLink    This is the house I've found to buy in Scotland.  I've always complained about my dwellings not having enough ventilation.  This one seems perfect though.  And it's cheap.  It's located in a little place called Middle Nowhereshire.   Do you like it?&nbsp; urlLink

      Even with all the fun and excitement in our lives, people just aren't getting it. I think its just you and me Matt. Last week, I cleaned my bike and went riding for the first time in months. It was nice... I need to find the good places back here in san diego. last time i had a bike here I was getting stitches from my diamond back. ah, the good old days.

      So, when's everyone gonna fly/drive to this thing? AprilTrue, I'm thinking we should try to get in at the same time so people can come pick us up... or we could rent a car or something. How long you thinking of taking off work? Just trying to figure this out as buying the plane ticket is needed pretty soon for the good cheap Reno to Portland rate.
