      Im feeling so alone. Kevin is away at camp, and Greg is in NH with his mom until saturday... The two people i really want to talk to, i really  need  to talk to...and i cant...well Greg has to call me, and i have no idea how to get in touch with Kevin. i made a new friend at Shandra's 18th B-Day party, her cousin- Steven Disney. Hes 16, three months younger than me, his bday is in dec. hes exactly like me only hes a guy, and hes tall, blonde curly hair, blue eyes, opp in appereance, but exactly the same in personality, except that he likes birds and i dont. hes funny, charming, sweet, EXTREMLY polite, hes such a gentleman...i can really see us becoming best friends, i kinda wish Kevin acted a lil more like Steve, cuz Steve is touchy feely, u know?? like me?? i like that in a guy, u dont have to be touch feely in a sexual way, (cuz only Greg can touch me like that...and if anyone else tries i will beat the living SHIT outa them, and then ill get Greg to also!!!) techno freaks, animae freaks...the whole nine yards...lol hes deff more best friend material, then bf material if u ask me, but i am attracted to him, he reminds me so much of Greg, i couldnt help but flirt with him at first, it felt like i was flirting with Greg all over again, when we first met, it felt good to remind myself of the first feeling of lightning running thru my veins because of Greg. but of course stupid me, i felt guilty for being attracted to Steve, because it was more so then a normal, "oh hes hott, lets follow him for a lil bit" kinda atttraction, i was so drawn to him, but i know it was only because i could see Greg in him, it made me want Greg right next to me, it made me want Greg on the dance floor, rubbing our bodies so close together again, becoming intimatly one with eachother and the music ( i never danced with Steve, he didnt want to, i tried but he wouldnt!! lol and there was only one slow dance that i was present for, and Jo-Al and i danced for that) I wanted to be in Greg's room, deeply burrowed under his covers with him again. completly ourselves with the other, bare, skin on skin, and dancing to that slow and sensual hot dance that brings two lovers together. I wanted to feel his arms around me, i wanted to feel his love rushing through me. I'm so mad that this is the week he had to leave. ive never craved him like this, not when hes not around me at least. for its hard for me not to crave him when hes pushed up against me, even more so!   "Ai yai yai    I'm your   little   butterfly     Green,   black   and   blue ,  make the colours in the sky!"     "Where's my samurai?"

      There is no such thing as hatred. i try not to hate people. but sam goes beyond hate. while i am trying to help her, she taunts me. telling me how shes a threat cuz my boyfriend would choose her over me because she is prettier than me. Greg would never choose you sam. i dont care if i was the ugliest person in the wolrd and u the most beautiful, if u stayed the way u are (personality wise and i stayed the same way i was,) then there would be no chioce. no competition. Greg loves me for who i am, not what i look like. you were never a threat, you are not a threat, and you never will be a threat. you can flaunt yourself to him all you want, walk up to him stark naked and say "FUCK ME!" and he would turn away, and come to me. i think she told everyone in my church that we are no longer talking, seeing as they all came up to me, and said how broken hearted sam was. so im assuming that she played me out to be the evil one (again!). but what ever, she knows what she did, she knows i have nothing to be ashamed of, she knows she's only contiuing the reasons why i am no longer friends with her. its your choice. i have made mine.

      I can feel the anger running through my veins, like strikes ur heart when ur about to die. When Kevin and i are online till 3 am, trying to figure out what to do about sam, how we can help her, without me talking to her. We have discovered a way. and we are going to put it to action very soon, we are merly waiting. But while Kevin and i are trying to be good christians and do as God will us to, that fucking selfish spoiled immature druggi brat, IMs me and will not tell me who it is, of course, i pick up on who it is. or at least, somethings still seem a lil weird like it was not her, like she just had someone else do it, but im not sure. But as i am mustering up every bit of strength and trying to swallow my anger for her, trying emensly to help her. she strikes me down. lies to me more. and the calmness i had once felt, was gone entirely. I felt like if i could, i would of with no hesitation what so ever reached into my computer screen and grabbed her throat. I would have no intentions of seriously hurting her, or such. just a warning, just to see the fear in her eyes, to give her a taste of her own medicine. i had a dream that she wouldnt let me go, she was dragging herself along grasping onto my ankles, when she pulled me out of the car i was trying to get into, i wrapped my fingers tightly around her neck and pushed both my thumbs into her air-way passage. i watched her gasp for breath and stare away from me...i help her in my grasp for no longer than 4 seconds but my grip was so great im sure she thought it was over, in my dream at least. i felt liberated. i felt she finally got what she deserved. i know some of u are prolly thiking im pretty sick, but it does not hurt that bad, it merly stops u from breathing for a few moments, it is only scary. in my dream i released her from my grip within 4 seconds and pushed her to the ground, i was kneeling and she was half lying, she laid on the ground coughing as i glared at her with the utmost rage and got into the car again and we drove off and my dream ended. if ur reading this. then its time i let u know, there is no escaping this time. nothing u can do is going to stop me from getting u help. but dont worry u will not be getting the kind of attention u want, and especially not from me, u will not under any cercumstance see me talking to the people i am choosing to talk to, they will all speak to u seperatly apart from me. they're going to know everything. and dont bother trying to get revenge on me by telling them i have made love with my boyfriend. as i have already gone through ur most predictable moves, and analyzed them. so its over, u are going to lose, there is no way to escape the enevitable.

      Ever had a dream that made u think about the things u always think of? Or not always think of but u like to think of? I had one of those last night. I slept over Katies, we watched Eurotrip (FUCKING BEST MOVIE EVER!!!)  and then i watched Katie play FFX-2...then she started a new game so i could see Yuna sing...lol and then she like gave me the controller and told me to fight...and of course i had no idea what i doing! And i also think that game was created by men who cant get laid!!! cuz all the dress spheres are SLUTTY!!! I'm not very excited about Greg playing this game! He's gonna like it too much! lol...but ne ways...once we were done with that...we went to bed at like 11:45 ish...but we stayed up and talked about stuff...Like truthfully...it feels weird to have one best friend now. We were both talking, saying how the both of us have always had two best friends, when Katie lived in Billrica she had Lauren and Gen, and here she had me and sam. But that has deff changed, and its for the much much better.  I mean Katie has me, and I guess Becca, and I've always had Kevin, but Kevin and i have lost what we once were....it's slowly coming back, and I hope we can be the kind of best friends we once were.  But I had this dream about Greg. Or maybe it was just a day dream. Or maybe it was me scanning my memory...remembering allthe things he has said to me, all the times i cought his eyes staring into mine. Remembering how everytime he touches me my whole body grows hot, I close my eyes and soak up the feeling. I love when I'm with Greg, I love who I am with Greg. Greg doesnt always get along too well with his dad, but when I'm there, things seem to be a little better, i mean, no ones perfect, u know? but its better. He seems easy going and light hearted. and i love the feeling i get when hes holding me in his arms. it's almost like it feels the whole world is standing still. like time has actually stopped. and the feeling i get like nothing else in this world matters except holding him tighter and pulling his warm body closer to mine. i've never been able to feel that with anyone, and believe ive tried, and ive even lied to myself.  cuz, well lets face it...i dont have the best taste in guys! lol lets see, we had mike, he cheated on me....perv! then there was Andy, he was a good bf, but it just wasnt there for both of us... then there was David...he was obbsessed with kissing, but i didnt mind that, but i only got to kiss him once...lol he just tried a lot! and then we had mario...oh please lets NOT go there! we all know he was a lil PDA freak but was the second MOST perverted bf i have had. and then we have number one bad and that was billy....goddam what the fuck was i EVER thinking??? damn, i was dumb huh?? for those of us who know the whole story?? lol...  Yesterday was the day I accepted Christ into my heart. The anniversery. 4  years. August 17, 2004, is when i did it.  Katie was the only one who remembered...What a true friend huh?? LOVE YA KATER!!   lol well i have to go and get ready for work now!  yea i have about an hour! and i need to go do some things b4 i leave for the beach! well l8ter for nows!!!
