       I am now emotionally scarred.     THOSE OF YOU WHO ATTEND THE AS-YET-UNDISCLOSED-BY-NAME-YET-TERRIBLY-EVIDENT-BY-INNUENDO COLLEGE THAT I WORK FOR ...do NOT eat the Cool Ranch Doritos (TM) in the Kava House.   They have no flavor.   Two people -- plus me -- have all opened separate bags, and have been psychologically damaged by the absence of Cool Ranchy goodness.  These are, simply, naked and flavorless corn chips.  Sweet Canadian Mullets...what the heck will happen next?!?

       Sleep.  I remember this theory.  It was a good one, at one time.  As it stands now, I think I'm getting it in three hour (or less) increments.  I don't think it's scientifically possible at this point for me to sleep more than three hours and four minutes at a stretch.  This is, logically, followed by me getting insomnia for a good half an hour before I conk out again.  Rest is for the weak.  I acknowledge it not.  -- and no, it's not due to unnatural caffeine ingestion.  I didn't drink any coffee products last night.    Part of the problem (I believe) comes from the fact I'm   not   taking my medication right now.  Now, before I am burned in effigy, it's because I was asked to see if I can keep from doing so before I take yet another return trip to the Friendly Neighborhood Neurologist, and they run another shiny, happy series of tests on me to see  what in the name of Xanadu  is wrong with my head.  So, Sonny has unnatural pain in his noggin (including, but not limited to, a scalp that is so tender that it hurts to wash my hair) and this makes the resting on the pillow to be an accomplishment in and of itself.  Feh.

        It's been one of THOSE Mondays;   I'm   not my biggest fan right now.  I'm just taking the attitude the rest of the free world has adopted -- apparently, I got "666" tattooed on my forehead last night or something...so, come on!  The game is called  Pile on Sonny !  I shall now go and seek therapy through caffeine.  Of  course , my bloody espresso machine WOULD choose this weekend to completely, utterly, and unfixably break (as in, knobs --  PLURAL!!  -- fall off at random).  Now I must buy another before I am comforted.  I'm tellin' ya -- it never rains.  It pours.  This.  World.  Blows.  When's the train for the next one?

       Good Lord, but some of you people are bloody impatient.   "Sonny, where's the latest news?"  "Sonny, where's the love gone?"  "Sonny, have you seen my shoes?"   Forgive me -- sometimes this job thing of mine takes hold and eats away my time.    Like today.  It's Monday, ergo, one must contend with the madness of the previous weekend.  However, there   was   no madness.  All flash, no crash.  Not that I'm COMPLAINING, mind you...it's just that this means I get to spend multiple hours digging through paperwork.  My desk is now clean.  -- okay, "clean" is not the best descriptor.  It's "free from a lot of random crap being piled on top of it."  Better?    ******  It's been very interesting to observe the changing of the interoffice dynamics here since new people arrived.  Those who have been here for a while and have done a lot of work [raises hand] now appear to be on the outside looking in.  Oh, it's not that I  wish  I spent multiple hours in meetings, but...  Picture this:  you've been working in a certain field, say,  higher education administration , for nigh on ten years.  You feel that you've done a more-or-less non-utterly-sucky job at it.  You've worked at, say,  three different institutions.  You've been given an increasingly larger number of priorities and assignments.  Let's also just  hypothetically  state that the  merest  possibility exists that at the current institution you work for, a person or persons who are in a higher position than you have been providing moronically less-than-quality work, and you -- based on who you are and the damnable work ethic you possess -- have, again,  hypothetically  speaking here, covered the arse of said person or persons above you on  MULTIPLE  occasions.    -- and yet, somehow, with the changing of the guard, a division line now exists.  An almost-visible, almost-tangible "us" (the people on one hallway) versus "them" (the people on the other hallway) mentality.  A feeling of how the "uses" are like batteries, and we're interchangeable, no matter who we might be.  A cabbage could come in and do as effective a job as you are doing.    Welcome to the "us" -- or rather, "me" -- feeling right now.  ...and yes, I can see how this might fly in the face of my earlier posting about Jessica.  But, it doesn't.  Swear to G-d, if it was not for the RA's, and  some  of the students here, I'd blow this joint in a heartbeat.  People wonder why I put up with this?  The "kids."  I honestly love the ideals of higher education, and by G-d, I they are the reason I do this, have done this, and will continue to do this.  The administrivia is just a bad, bad, by-product of it all.  But...my gracious and giving nature can only extend so far.  I'm burnt, and burnt badly.  I'd like to be appreciated as a professional for a change.  Call me mad, but that's my wish.  Unless something   MIRACULOUS   happens in the course of the next few months...  I leave in May.  Or June, at the latest.    It's best I leave  here  before I leave the field.    And you've heard (okay, "read") it here first.

       I think I just had a religious experience.  After two days of trying to download the new trailer for  The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King , I finally succeeded in proving my geekiness and did so.  Just about three minutes ago.  Holy Elvis, this looks amazing.  I've read the books at least a dozen times.  I've read  The Silmarillion , and the "lost" writings of Tolkien.  I freakin'  KNOW  what's going to happen in this movie, but...I honestly don't have any breath left to be taken away.    Unreal.  Amazing.  And still two bloody months away.   *sigh*...

       ...sometimes, after literally sitting around and wondering if you make any difference in the world and in anyone's life...wondering if they couldn't just hire some yolkel off the street to do what you do, because you feel about as appreciated as a cold sore...sometimes, just one sentence will pop out at you that makes you realize that, in some small, infinitesimal ways, you might matter.  Like last night.  I had a couple of my RA's over to watch  A Mighty Wind .  (Hey, someone has got to assist with the education of the young and impressionable.  Might as well be my dorky arse.)  So, we're sitting there after the movie, talking, laughing...and then, Jessica's phone rings.   She answers it, and it's a call from a friend of hers at home.  Now, keep in mind -- I have no clue who this person is, and they sure as cocoa don't know me.  But Jessica makes one comment, probably totally off-the-cuff, which made time freeze for me, and was the nicest thing anyone has said about me in, oh, forever:  Her comment was something along the lines of,  "I'm over at my boss' apartment.  Yeah, he lives on campus, and he's my boss,  but he's more of a friend than anything ."   [Emphasis added by me.]  I slept more soundly last night than I have in months.  No joke.    And, unless the little brazen hussy finds this posting, she'll never know what a huge, huge, huge difference her comment made in my life.     Crap.  Now I'm  feeling  things again.  I think I liked it better when my soul was devoid of life and there was just a dark, empty place where my heart used to be.

       In a move to either push me off the cliffs of insanity or to make me become the newest poster child for AA, one of the fraternities here on campus is finally getting taken off social probation this weekend.  So, clearly, they  need  to have a party to celebrate this fact.  They're having the  Official Hooray, We're Off Social Probation Party .  And yes, that  IS  the registered name they've given it.     Gotta admit -- it beats the heck out of the  Catholic Schoolgirls and Drunken Old Perverts Swap  that a fraternity here held last weekend.      Note to self -- find a new life.  Fast.

       Well.  This has been just one big ol' week of firsts for the Sonnster.  Last night (don't worry -- I'll give the whole story later on), I managed to find myself at The Forum.  -- now before you ask, no, The Forum is not a place where men in togas go to spout off philosophy.  God knows I couldn't be that lucky.  No, the Forum is...well, let's just start at the beginning, 'kay?  A friend of mine is turning 34 today.  Bemoaning the "loss" of her youth, she asked me and a few people out for drinks after work.  Lager's -- the candy store of imported beers here in Jackson -- was the designated starting spot.  I don't have a problem in the world with Lager's.  They serve me Beamish.  This makes me happy.    Anyway, after Karen polished off her eleven-hundredth Appletini, she slurred out the sentence  "Heylet'sgodancingoveratTheForum'causeit'smybirthdayblaargh."     Now, I had avoided The Forum up to this point, for one reason and one reason alone -- Better Than Ezra.  Oh, it's not that I have a burning hatred for BTE.  Quite the opposite, in fact.  It's just...I bloody well refuse to pay  $25  to go see a band I saw DOZENS of times for FREE while I was in college.  Call me crazy.  It's a me thing.  So, by association, I refuse to support any dive hole in the wall that would force me to turn over some of my heard-earned money (that could be better spent -- I don't know -- buying sea monkeys over the Internet) to go see a band that I pretty much own stock in.  But, this being Karen's birthday and all, I go.  ...and here my troubles began.  Words fail me.  I can not describe the enormity of the travesty that is The Forum.  In between the hoochie mommas, the mullets, and the bartender whose cup size was clearly DD and her shirt size was XS (and it was an open chest shirt as well, much to the pain of all)...there was a kid there.  A.  Kid.  She couldn't have been more than 13, and she was shooting pool.  In the back room -- which was located next to the most unkempt and hygenically impaired kitchen imaginable.  The best part was listening to the mouth on this kid.  Man.  She has a future in sales, lemme tell ya.  I don't think that I've ever used some of the words she did.  She dropped the "F-bomb" so many times, it was like experiencing Bosnia.  After some woman who looked like the body double of Patsy from AB FAB  grabbed my ass  while I was standing slack-jawed at the inbred troglodytes around me...I cashed my chips in.  Birthday be damned, and the vodka tonic I was drinking was weaker than my fortitude at this point.  So, I left.  I went someplace sane -- Fenian's.  Nothing says "Welcome Home" like an Irish pub.  -- yeah, okay, so it's in Mississippi.  Big deal.  Like I care.    ...'course, I did eventually come back to campus to see a "WELCOME, HELL'S ANGELS" sign on the side of one of the fraternity houses here.  And people wonder why I take so much medication for migraines.  Honestly.

       So, last night, I was introduced to yet another Jackson Landmark --  the Cherokee .  Now, I've lived here for three years.  I've avoided a lot of the local "hot" spots, mostly because they induce self-destructive and suicidal thoughts.  I mean, Jackson is the capital of Mississippi, yet there are (a) no dance clubs for people my age and those close to my age, (b) no GOOD bars -- meaning, those that aren't frequented by bleach-blonde floozies lookin' for a  GOOD MAN , and (c) no artsy places.  Granted, as far as a social life goes, the artistic stuff can fall to the wayside nine times out of ten, but...eh.  It's still worth mentioning.  'Cause some days, you just want a good museum.  Or film house.  Of which we have neither.    Anyway, the Cherokee was reportedly this oh-so-kewl place to go.  Every time that I drove by there, it was packed.  Packed.  People were lining up out the door, and -- in spite of the 1950's sign (which wasn't retro; it was authentic) announcing "Cold Beer," -- it seemed, from the exterior, to be a happenin' little joint.  So, when two women of the Major Babeage Persuasion (both friends, both in committed, happy relationships, damn their souls) ask me if I'd like to join them for a drink after work at the Cherokee, I was more than willing to give it a go.  Mostly for the company, but hey -- it was going to be a new experience for Sonny.  I was up for it.  So, at about 6:00 pm, I steeled my nerves and entered Yon Cherokee.    Oh.  My.  Freakin'.  God .   -- y'know, I am open-minded.  I am a well-rounded fellow.  I tend to not be judgmental in all aspects of life, but THIS place...to call it a "Greasy Spoon Diner" is a gross understatement.  It was more like a "Greasy Full Utensil Drawer" taken to the max.  Let's start the descriptions with the physical building and move into the clientele, shall we?   THE BAR  -- looked like it was ripped out of someone's wood-paneled, shag-carpeted basement.  Not ONLY did they not have a liquor license, they also did not have any imported beers, thereby leaving me with "Bud" and "Miller" as my ONLY two drink choices.  I've honestly seen stage sets that looked more authentic.  I've seen men's restrooms in freshman residence halls that were cleaner.     THE BOOTHS  -- were booths.  As in picnic benches, with plastic red-checkered covers.  For those of you who have been to the typical Southern deep-frying catfish huts...yep.  Looked exactly like that.  Oh -- and they were sticky.  Some of the booths were built into the walls, and they were a  little  more stable than an epileptic Tasmanian devil.      THE FOOD  -- I'm sorry, but I just could not bring myself to order food that looked like the primary ingredients were fat, grease, and more fat and grease.  Ugh.     THE REST OF THE PLACE  --  the men's restroom  did not have a door leading to the toilet.  You open the door to go in, and if you open it wide enough, people walking by could see you doing your business;  the hallway  leading to the restroom was poorly lit, and had five or six free-standing video games in it.  I did not make note of what they were, for fear of my brain imploding;  the juke box  (yes, and authentic juke box) held such new releases as... The Joshua Tree ;  the patio  -- behind the restrooms -- looked to be where the Jackson chapter of the Women Who Are Krispy Kreme Overeaters and Like To Wear Stretch Pants Three Sizes Too Small was congregating;  the kitchen   was, I believe, behind the three uncovered-and-filled-to-the-brim-to-the-point-of-overflow trashbins.     THE SERVERS  -- the less said the better.  I think they imported cast extras from  Deliverance  -- as in they were that old, that ugly, and they seemed to want to tell us we all had purty mouths.  One of them looked to be wearing a shirt that was so covered in various and sundry stains that the original color was lost some time around 1987.     THE CLIENTELE  -- well, I had to take an anti-depressant after I got home.  Does that sum it up?  Puffy hats, unkempt facial hair...if I had seen this crowd when I was a teenager, and thought that THIS was what I had to look forward to once I became and adult, I would have killed myself before high school was over.     Mercifully, we were  only  there for two hours.  One of the parties I went with had to go home to watch  The Bachelor .    I went home and cried.  And drank.  Alone.  In the dark.

       The  Humorous Recap of  Sonny & Mike's Excellent Adventure   Continues...   PART THE FOURTH -- in which we learn How  Not  To Stage A Protest...    So, Chuckles and I park his car, and the we begin our trek across the campus of USM looking for the protest site.  Amazingly (he says, rolling his eyes as he types), the protest area was not clearly delineated.  Shocking, I know, but bear with me.  Mike was told via his listserv that the protest would take place at the "Main Entrance" of USM.  If you've ever BEEN to USM's campus, then you realize that USM has about 17 "main entrances" -- we were unclear if the Nazis were going to be located at the main entrance by the Student Center, the main entrance by the giant marquee, the main entrance by the football field, the main entrance by the main driving thoroughfare...decisions, decisions, decisions.    Have I mentioned it was WET lately?  No?  Well, it was.  And getting muddy and drenched while surrounded by a gaggle of 4-H alums and future slaves to the monkey grinder was NOT how I was planning on enjoying my Saturday.  I'd rather have been at home, with my lazy arse on my couch, watching reruns of GODZILLA films or something.  But, how many chances would I get to see humanity at its worst, all up close and personal like this?  Not many.  I tend to avoid racists and bigots.  It's a personal thing.    So, after passing the alumni house (and  not  being offered a refreshing adult beverage -- and I was even inadvertently wearing USM colors!!  So much for Southern hospitality...) we located the mass.  Located at the front driving entrance (for maximum visualization, no doubt, as they wanted EVERYONE on hardy Street to see and hear their message), they were easily noticeable by the gaudy and hateful signs they were carrying.     God Hates Fags.  Thank God for September 11.  God Blew Up the Shuttle.   ...and so on.  Close to a whopping total of a   DOZEN   of Fred Phelps Whelps were there.  A.  Dozen.  Fifteen at the most.  And on "our" team?  Tons more.  Oh, to be sure, the GLBT Group hadn't taken into account the ran that was coming down (as all their signs were running and streaking -- through, mercifully, none of THEM were running and streaking -- due to the fact they used colored markers and construction paper), and the group never stayed at a constant number (due to the fact that there WAS a football game going on; hello!).  But...but...there were a lot of students there.    Fraternity members would walk by and voice their support to the counter-protestors.  Granted, a lot of them were drunk, but on more than one occasion, they would remark -- to the Phelpsites -- that they should get off their campus; that they weren't welcome here; that USM didn't want their [insert expletives here] hate here.    People drove by in droves, honking, cheering, and waving at the counter-protestors, voicing their support, and -- in one case -- blatantly flipping off the Phelps crew while shouting vulgarities at them.  The news crews came, and the USM students looked and sounded calm, rational, professional, and they expressed genuine pain that people could hate them so much, just because of who they were.    Students unaffiliated with any group would come by and express support for the counter-protestors, staring in genuine disbelief at the Phelps crew.    And the Phelps team?  I'll not give them one iota of free space to those people.  Just know that it was clear who the calm group was.     THUS ENDS CHAPTER FOUR.  Coming Soon -- Chapter Five:  The Endcap.

       The  Humorous Recap of  Sonny & Mike's Excellent Adventure   Returns -- now with added riboflavin!     PART THE THIRD -- and the boys brave the campus...and the loons...   Ever seen Hattiesburg during a home football game?  I swear, I think everyone in the bloody city comes out (ironic choice of words, no?) for the game.  Partially, because they're probably all alums, but also because there's nothing else to DO in Hattiesburg.    Anyway, Mike & I drive from the "mall" over to the campus of USM.  Now, keep in mind, that this is an SEC-wannabe school.  They try to do everything the BIG SEC schools do, including, but not limited to, letting their student body run free and drink unchecked on campus during a BIG GAME weekend.  I should know.  I worked for one of those BIG SEC schools.  I have a cowbell to prove it.    So, we drive around the campus, looking for a parking place.  That takes all of five minutes.  All the bloody lots are full -- full of campers, RV's, tents...I think I even saw a family BBQ taking place.  It wouldn't surprise me.  So, after agreeing that parking on campus makes about as much sense as me wearing something that's not an earth tone, we head across the street.  Now,  caveat  here folks -- please insert any and all stereotypes of Mississippi you would care to at this point.  When I state we're going to park across the street, this means Mike and I will leave his car in a   field  , tromp through wet grass and mud (gee, glad I dressed for this), and then cross four lanes of traffic:  Highway 49, which is actually one of the two or three main thoroughfares for Hattiesburg.  Sad, really.  Two wet, white guys sprinting across the road, hoping that the souped-up truck bearing down on us does not have a "roadkill" sighting.  Blah.  So, we march for about three minutes (which feels like seventy minutes -- IT'S RAINING, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!), and we make it onto the campus of USM.  Now all we have to do is find where the damn protest is supposed to take place.  All we see are bubbas, beer cans, and the ugliest cheerleader and dance team outfits ever known to man.     THUS ENDS CHAPTER THREE .  Coming Soon -- Chapter Four:   God Hates Fags.    Apparently, though, He is supposed to give his support to hatemongers.

       So, after a three year gap of not knowing where the hell he was, I finally -- through searching for minutes and minutes on the Internet -- locate my old college roommate from the days of the undergrad.    Turns out the chunk is living in our shared old hometown of Tupelo, teaching at our shared old Junior High (now Middle School) of Milam.    The more things stay the same, kids...   Oh, and he's no longer a card-carrying member of the "She Dumped Me, Dave" Club ( and if you catch that reference, give yourself a pat on the back of your straightjacket, you sad, sad little person ).  He's dating again after She Who Must Not Be Named (Version 1.0) ripped the poor schlub's soul out.  I'm proud of him.  Of course, if he's gained weight and lost his hair and he's  still  got a significant other...whatever.  There is no justice in the world.  There's also no  coffee  in my mug, so if you will excuse me...

       Finally -- some good news.  Two of my fav'rite bands will be performing on two consecutive days that fall close to my birthday.  It looks like I -might- be able to make it off campus for more than three hours for a change.  I haven't left campus (or Jackson, for that matter) since...June?  And it'll be November before I get to head out again.    Anyway, the performances are listed below: November 13:   King's X  -- performing at the University of Southern Mississippi November 14:   Over the Rhine  -- performing in New Orleans   Two completely different styles of music, two completely wonderful gigs.  ROAD TRIP!!  I call shotgun.

       Hey -- didja catch the Emmys last night?    I DIDN'T  .  I was running helter-skelter in the rain last night, dealing with some jackass political morons (translation: " Republicans ") who were going door-to-door in the residence halls, soliciting personal information from the students.  Like, say, their  SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER .  I almost got to call the Jackson Police Department and get people arrested!!  Yay!  Still wouldn't make up for  MISSING JON STEWART'S MONOLOGUE , but...see, solicitation of ANY sort is HIGHLY against all 'Saps rules, but especially in the residence halls.  So, I got to deal with some puffed up self-important fat, balding, white guy who thought he could toss his Boss Hogg self abouts and think I would cower in fear.  Ask my RA's about my 'tude last night.  They all got a scathing voice mail from me.  If this appalling ham creature thought he'd intimidate me...feh.  Go back to the county fair and get on a soapbox, slappy.    Other bit of random ulcer-inducing news:  my coworker, Mike Coogans, likes to walk around the neighborhood for exercise.  I do Yoga.  I can't judge.  Anyway, Mike, my clearly  not -heterosexual coworker, calls me on Friday afternoon to tell me that "some hottie chick" pulled over in her $80,000,000 Mercedes SUV to try and pick him up.   Pick.  Him.  Up.   The last date I had came in  bag of dried fruit.  And this cheeky bastich is being hit on by the gender he cares nothing for.    I quit.  I'm going to get a less-stressful job, like manhandling HIV-positive cobras or something.

       PART THE SECOND --  In which our intrepid heroes drink a lot of caffeine .  So, it was raining on Saturday.  Not a hard rain, but one of those steady ones where if you stand outside for, say, two hours, you're bound to get drenched.  Faboo.    Mike & I headed out at approximately 1:30, bound for Hattiesburg, armed with a bag of pretzels, a Diet Vanilla Pepsi, and a Diet Dr. Pepper.  We knew there would be war, and we were prepared.  An hour and a half later -- and after a lengthy debate on the differences between a "  sanatorium  " and a "  sanitarium  " (don't ask; you'll only hurt yourself) -- we arrived in H-burg.  We still had an hour to kill, so we went to the local "mall" for a quick cup of coffee for me, and a quick run to the  parfum  counter at McRae's for Mike, so he could re-apply some Polo Blue.    At The Coffee Beanery, Mike and I overheard a few USM students talking about the impending arrival of the Phollowers of Phelps, and how the USM GLBT (that's "gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgendered") Student Group and the USM Chapter of Amnesty International were going to be armed to the teeth with posters and the like to show up the nuts that were going to be protesting.  I have to admit, it made me feel good to hear that the students were up in arms about this.  As someone who is a card-carrying Ally (loose translation:  someone who is heterosexual but is a supporter of friends and family members who are g/l/b/t), I felt really, really good that here -- in the buckle of the Bible belt -- there were people who weren't willing to condemn the GLBT group, and were genuinely p*ssed that this schmoe was coming to their school.  It shows me just how far Mississippi in general has grown, and how much support people are willing to show to their fellow human beings.  It's called "being decent," for those of you who are caring-impaired.     And thus armed with a Mocha Latte, and smelling well, Mike & I left the mall...for the drive to USM, and the confrontation with...  the bigots  .   THUS ENDS CHAPTER TWO.  Coming Soon -- Chapter Three:   Holy Shyte, I'm Cold .

       Son of a -- well, it appears that America's Single Most Crappy ISP Ever Invented (i.e.: our campus server) has gone wonky again.  Ergo, this frees me up a li'l time to provide the  Humorous Recap of  Sonny & Mike's Excellent Adventure   to Hattiesburg to go deal with the hate mongers.  For those of you not in the know (and shame on you if you don't know), this jackass by the name of Fred Phelps (a native Mississippian -- go fig) has taken it upon himself to become God's Instrument of Divine Retribution...against people he finds that are different from him.  That would be most of the civilized word, but I digress.  Anyway, this charming pinnacle of dickhood was also the dimwit who decided that a protest at the funeral of Matthew Shepard (feel free to visit the memorial site at  urlLink http://www.matthewshepard.org/ ) was something that was clearly in good taste.  I've had the opportunity to hear Judy Shepard, Matthew's mom, speak, and it left me feeling like someone had torn my soul out.  If wish that I could I have 1/1,000th of that woman's courage and strength.  Amazing.  Mike Coogans (-ha!- names have been changed to protect the hip and trendy), the other AD at The College I Work For is on the  Equity Mississippi   listserv, and he was given notice that the Phelps Phanatics would be staging several protests in the state of Mississippi, both at several churches and at the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg.    ...now, before I proceed, I feel the need to toss out a nice little  caveat :  despite the beliefs of others, I myself am one of "those others" -- a heterosexual.  Yes, I admit it.  I dig chicks.  I might dress nicely (for the most part), have an odd addiction to  Queer Eye for the Straight Guy , and spend way too much time making sure that my apartment and I both look good, but...eh.  I'm straight, but not narrow.  Most of my male friends are indeed gay, but -- good Lord, I'm a single male working in Student Affairs.  We're stereotyped.  Diogenes couldn't find an honest man, and it's about as difficult to find one of my kind working in Student Affairs.  [insert obligatory lamp/flame one-liner here]  THUS ENDS CHAPTER ONE -- for I am hungry and must eat.

        "...and we're back.  Thanks for holding.  Caller #3, you're up next."   Ah, me.  It's just another day in this fine little slice of paradise called Jackson.  Whoo-ha.    Those of you familiar with the 'saps will find great humor in this -- the Kava House, the lovely little coffee shop on the first floor of the Student Center is now serving Starbucks (TM) coffee.  Yes, Starbucks (TM) coffee.  Because, clearly, Starbucks (TM) coffee is superior to all else.    [For those of you with a scorecard -- we've gone from Broadstreet to Millsaps to Starbucks (TM).  That's a new food carrier/provider for every year I've been here.  "Heavens, what shall they do when I leave," he asks, mocking sincerity obvious to all...]  At any rate, we've got Starbucks (TM) coffee...with the typical Kava House service.  I just walked upstairs after spending five minutes waiting for someone to come to the front and actually check me out.  -- okay, so I actually walked behind the counter and poured my own...three...to-go cups of coffee (I like to share), but still...one would think that with a huge corporation like Starbucks (TM) to provide Starbucks (TM) brand coffee we'd get Starbucks (TM) brand service.  But noooo....  Shoulda just gone to the freakin' Caf and gotten yogurt.    Oh -- and I'm now getting notices from friends of mine who live in coastal areas along the east coast that they're either (a) evacuating due to that "hurricane" thing that's coming by, or (b) they're evacuating because -- as in the case of the College of William and Mary --  the whole bloody school is shutting down to evacuate.   Godspeed to you, Jack.  May your students be bright enough to evacuate.  MINE AREN'T.  -- case in point:  the last BIG storm we had this summer, when all the sirens are going off on campus, and Campus Safety is having to go into the Writing Center to evacuate it , what do I find?  Three drunk little fraternity boys hanging out under a tree.   Drinking.     Sitting on a blanket.    'Cause they thought it's be cool to watch the storm come in.    Yeah.  We have such bright ones here...

(A word I will never, ever get used to...).The reasons are varied, and quite entertaining: (a)  Well, when I'm not working on judicial cases for this place, it will give me something to do besides read; (b)  There are enough random things that happen in the course of a day that it needs to be documented somewhere;  (c)  Once the Internet gains sentience and destroys all carbon-based life on this planet, the machines will keep me on as a comedian; and (d)  To prove I'm a nerd.    So.  There ya go.  Oh -- I have a nice little reception in an hour to go meet the two (2) new people we have working in Student Affairs...two people who I have YET to be introduced to, despite the fact that they've been here, oh, two weeks.

        Just to share...because I feel the need to vent...   The outright exclusion is what annoys the living p*ss out of me.  It's not as if this is my first job, or even that I have had limited experience with students -- I've worked in Admissions, Enrollment Management, Greek Life, Orientation, Student Activities, Computer Based Testing, and the Counseling Center of *two* different schools.  I've got almost TEN YEARS worth of experience under my belt, and yet I feel like sometimes I'm looked at as if I just graduated this past May, all I have is a Bachelor's degree, and I'm an incompetent idiot.   There have been three times now when I have said something and people have looked at me like they just noticed me.  Like I've been sitting in the corner, hidden in the shadows, and never saying a word.   I'd much rather be p*ssed about having to deal with an inordinate amount of  "administrivia"  and go to what I feel are useless meetings than be cast aside like I'm not important because I'm not on THAT hallway.       Sod this -- I want a better world.

       Last night, I went to go see the lovely rendition of  Fiddler on the Roof  that was put on by the college.  And it was  amazing .  The sets, the costumes, the actors...while not a "professional" production, it was damn close.  The only letdown was the guy who played the lead.  He was rather weak, and at times, I felt like he was just reciting lines he'd read from somewhere with absolutely NO charisma.    Plus, the sound just went... weird ...when he tried to sing.  Oh, and he tried.  In vain.

       Sometimes...this place just amazes me.  Take for example the fact  that the Director of the FYE Program just came into my office, all flustered and in a tizzy.  She's nervous because -- next week -- she has to put on a presentation to the faculty about this year's freshman class:  what we've observed, what their experiences here at 'saps have been like, etc.  Now, the simple act of putting on a presentation can and does often make one nervous.  But, does her anxiety stem from the fear of lookin' like a big ol' dork in front of the faculty?     Nooooo ....that would be logical.    Her cause for concern?  And I quote:   "I  don't know  what these freshmen are like!  I don't  interact  with them!  I live in the same building as a lot of them -- shouldn't that be enough?!?"     I'm going to go kill myself now.

       First things first:   urlLink THIS  is just damn cool.  I think I could waste a few days on this game.  Just because.  ******  Well, for those of you who are so inclined to care about such things ( hi, mom ), li'l Sonny is feeling somewhat better.  So much so, in fact, that last night...I went to the circus.  Yep.  Big top & all.  Why?  Well, mostly because my other options were to sit at home and watch TV and wait for the lunacy to begin (see the Board of Trustees are visiting, and someone who shall remain nameless is about to shyte himself because things MUST look PERFECT for them), or to go to bed.  So, I loaded up in my needs-to-get-inspected Jetta and went to go see the carnies.    Whoosh.  Man.  That tent stunk.  And the acts weren't that much better.  And, it's been a  while  since I went to the circus, but I don't quite recall all the women looking like they needed a few makeup hints from a drag queen, and I  KNOW  that I don't remember all the homoerotic imagery with the body-clean-shaven and buffed-up trapeeze dudes with their leave-nothing-to-the-imagination tights.    *bleah*  "It smells like a monkey house in here."  Indeed.

Last night, for example, we had a screening of  urlLink The American Astronaut , and it...was... amazing .  I liked the darn thing so much I bought the soundtrack.  I'm listening to it right now, while waiting for my brain to explode.      "WHAT DID YOUR FATHER TEACH YOU?"

       Forget the idea of an essay as part of the Admissions process -- I am now a staunch advocate the idea of a mandatory   psychological screening   for incoming students.    In the last day or two, let's see -- we've gotten reports of strippers, pot-bellied pigs, and drunken first-year students standing on the lawns of the fraternity houses screaming that the men in the fraternities "don't know how to treat women right."  PLUS...there is the added advantage of the lovely story of one of my residents coming to see me, claiming that their roommate is doing drugs, and that she confiscated some of the paraphanelia.   "Great," thinks I.  "This day is turning out to live up to the ideal of a Monday the 13th."   So, I see the baggie containing the drug-related material.  It includes:  (a) a bottle cap from Michelob Lite, (b) a tube used for yeast infections, and (c) something that smells an awful lot like cranberry potpourri.    I'm just looking for the hidden cameras now.  My life makes utterly no sense.  *sigh*

       [I apologize in advance for non-personalized approach.  This is just the easiest way to get news out.  -S]     Well, there's news, and then there's news.  This definitely falls under the "news" category.   As some of you may know, I have been having recurring migraines for the last two years or so.  Not those weenie little "wah, I need to stay home because I have a tummy ache" level migraines.  These are the big ones that cause you to black out, get a nosebleed, or wish to God above the someone would just shoot you and get it over with.  What's been weird is that the pain has been localized -- it's located at the upper left hemisphere of the back of my head.  Take your left hand, put it on the crown of your head.  Bingo.  Right there.  Where your palm is.  (Man, you all look silly...)   My primary physician (ironically, his last name is "Headley") sent me in for a series of tests last year, including -- but not limited to -- multiple MRI's, at least two C-T Scans, and more X-rays and blood work than you can shake a Pixy Stix at.  The reason for all of this was the fear that I had a tumor in my brain.  Every symptom I was exhibiting was totally in line with that.  But, aptly enough, the multiple tests showed that there was nothing abnormal in my brain.  [Many would argue that my brain in and of itself is an abnormality, but I digress.]   For a year now, I have been taking my body weight in pain medication.  Codeine.  Imitrex.  Percocet.  You name it, I was taking it.  See, the way my head pain works is that it's constant.  Never-ending.  There's not a moment in any given day where I am not in pain somewhat.  The pain flows and crests, so it's not as if I'm in screaming pain all day long.  Pain, yes, but searing " OHSWEETLORDWHATTHEHELLISGOINGON?"  pain?  Not so much.  I've learned to live with the constant headaches.  "That which does not kill me still stings like a son of a beyotch," or whatever the phrase is.     As of late (in the last handful of months), the pain has gotten worse.  Much worse.  The pain has been peaking daily, and many of my RA's have noticed me squinting a lot.  It's because it's the reaction to pain -- one winces.  Ain't fun, kids.  Ain't.  It's gotten to the point that the OUTSIDE of my head is so sensitive from the pain, I can't sleep or lie on my left side.  Dr. Headley was at a loss to explain it, and so we consulted a neurologist or two (always get a second opinion, kids.  It's necessary).     NEUROLOGIST #1 -- PROGNOSIS:  my brain is hyperactive.  I am actually producing neurons at rate exceptionally higher than what my brain can process.  My nice little scans show that the area of my head which is hurting like a mo-fo is actually super-heating.  There is this dark (or brightly colored, depending on the scan one is looking at) mass in the back of my head where the concentrated brain activity is taking place.  It's not moving, and it looks -- and is to be treated -- tumor-ish.  I'm literally cooking my brain inside my cranium, because I'm thinking too much.  -- yeah, full-level Alanis Morissette irony here, folks.  I have something called  Trigeminal Neuralgia , a disorder which usually strikes the face and the front of the head, but -- because I just can't do a bloody thing like the rest of the world wants me to -- mine is attacking something called the "Occipital Nerve."  This is a big nerve ending that runs from your noggin down your spine and into your Doc Martins.  So, my pain is in the back of my head as opposed to being in the front.  It's also a mild version of and first cousin to Epilepsy.  What's weird is that I have no history of getting hit in the head with anything hard enough to cause massive trauma to the cranium.  Long story short -- keep taking drugs, and we'll see what can be done.  However, there's really not a lot that can be, as you have this hyperactive brain activity that is literally burning through the medication.  The additional rub for all of this is...that I appear to have a degenerative neurological disorder, as of yet unnamed (WTF?!?  I've bloody well paid for a CAR with all these doctor's visits and medications.  I at LEAST deserve a name!!).  So, take one disease causing a log-jam in your head which is causing neurological breakdown, add something ELSE that is causing neurological breakdown...fun!  2 + 2 = oww.     POSSIBLE OUTCOME:  aneurysm;  nerve endings continue to decay; brain superheats and cooks from the inside.  Potentially all lethal outcomes (DUH!).   NEUROLOGIST #2 -- PROGNOSIS:  agreed with everything #1 stated, but also went a step further to suggest treatment.  Novel thought, that.  No "suck it up, Slappy, and deal with it."  RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:  chemical therapy, two words which strike fear into the heart of everyone.  Induce a neural inhibitor directly into my brain.  POSSIBLE OUTCOME:   in addition to the ones listed above?  Nothing new.  SECONDARY TREATMENT SHOULD CHEMOTHERAPY FAIL:  surgery.  Brain surgery.  Attempt to isolate the neural activity, and reestablish normal pathways of blood and electricity flow.  POSSIBLE OUTCOME:  well, f*cking think about it -- they're proposing to cut my damn skull open.  Do the math.  Yep, we're talking the big "D" again.     ******   At 9:00 am, 8 October 2003, I begin my chemo treatment.  This will have to continue for a minimum of six weeks, a maximum of nine.  I will go in every two weeks for treatment.     Hi, and welcome to hell.  Smoking section is to the left.     ******   Until such time as I either kick off or I get fixed (not like a puppy, but "fixed" in my head), I am going to continue to just walk through things as per normal.  I think I've got about 841 sick and vacation days saved up, so I'm not worried about that.  If this does lead to my pushing the little daisies to make them come up -- a probability which, candidly, does exist -- then hey...I push.  If this chemo stuff works...well, at least I'm already losing my hair.  I won't miss much.  :)     Now, this does NOT mean that I should start test-driving coffins yet.  However, it does mean that there is a really, really, really good chance that I might need to think about it.  Especially if the two proposed treatments do not produce the intended results.  Here and I thought that my students would always be the death of me.  Great.     ******   And yes, this does mean that my walk through purgatory is apparently not over (some of you will get the reference; don't lose sleep if you don't).  "Things" keep happening to me.  I'm either paying off a shyteload of bad karma from the last 17 lives, or this is just one more showing of the universe using me for an ashtray in order to make me stronger for something.     Whatever the rationale, please -- keep me in your thoughts/heart/prayers (as applicable).  Especially next Wednesday.  This is gonna suck.  Bleah!     Peace out, -S

       Tonight is the season premiere of  Angel .  It is in all likelihood the last season of  Angel .    I have a bottle of Cabernet sitting at home with David Boreanaz's name on it.   Tomorrow, I will probably have an hangover with David Boreanaz's name on it, the bastich.  ******  Okay, we're still nine days away from a full moon, yet the first year students here have decided to go ahead and get all lycanthropic on me.    Last night, I got a call about a cat fight.  An honest-to-goodness, hair-tearing, face-scratching, tooth-biting cat fight.  Between two women who -- as of two weeks ago -- were ready to declare war on each other.  The best part is that when each were asked separately if they wanted to move, they both said "no."  They both agreed they'd try to get along.    Yeah.    THAT   really worked.  ******   ...and a shout-out to Lane.  What up, yo?

       ...ah,   Thanksgiving  ...I get to stay here in the wonderful world of Millsaps until the residence halls close at 3:00 pm.  Then, we initiate a room-to-room, building-to-building sweep of all the halls to make sure people are not squatting in their rooms over the break.  We HAVE to do this, as the halls close down when the offices are closed, and I have caught people hiding in bathroom stalls and closets before.  No joke.  Thursday morning, I will begin the trek to Ye Olde Homesteade of Starkville for the EGG BOWL.  I get to see my parents and sister (hoo-ha) and we can see if I can make it into the driveway and put my car in park before we all erupt into a skirmish.  The day will consist of me trying to explain what I cooked and brought with me (I tend to cook foods that are a WEE bit healthier than my biological relatives are used to), followed by a lengthy debate on why I'm not married, why I'm a heathen, what exactly it is that I do (which, after working in Higher Education for ALMOST TEN YEARS NOW, one would think my parents MIGHT "get it"), and just how much cooler and socially acceptable my jackass kid sister is than I am.  It's like a holiday special with the most dysfunctional family imaginable.  But, there's a lot of love.  It's normally found after my mom gets tipsy from the  TWO glasses of wine she'll have.  Lightweight...  Thursday night I will drive home, and sit my frazzled ass down back at home and watch the walls for three or four hours, just to de-stress.  Friday I may try and fight the moonlight (sorry; I mean "traffic") and go hunting the ever-elusive bargains that strike on Black Friday.  -- oh, who'm I kidding?  I'll just rent movies and order pizza.   Screw the mall.   Especially Friday.  All I'd do is buy crap for me and then complain about the inbred locals who go to the malls on the Friday after Thanksgiving at 2:00 am just to get that extra 5% off their framed duck prints at Kirkland's.

       I look forward to out weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly staff meetings about as much as I would getting my eyeball pierced.  Our monthly staff meetings used to consist of boring people going around the table explaining what all is happening in their specialty areas, while I spent the time writing out a suicide letter that I would use if the meeting didn’t end quickly.  Now we have monthly  STAFF DEVELOPMENT  meetings where we all have to learn to play nice and bond with one another.  I'm planning on intentionally having an aneurysm one Friday during these torture experiences, just to get out of it.  I now understand why animals in the wild sometimes chew their own legs off to get out of traps.

       So, for the first time in -- oh, over two months -- I have been able to start exercising again.  And yes, by exercise, I mean I'm getting back into my Yoga regiment.  Why?  Well, there're a couple of reasons:  (a)  It's the holiday season, and people cook.  TOO much.  And, with this food that they prepare, they expect me to eat said food.  And these heathens do not cook with soy, organic food, or even anything lite or diety.  These culinary Nazis use full-fat foods and heavy cream.  Ergo, if I want to keep my waistline  under  48 inches, I must Yoga-ize;  (b)  For the first time since I started having these ******* chemicals injected directly into my noggin, I feel like doing physical things again.  Unfortunately, some of the physical activities I would like to engage in, I can not, as I have no monogamous partner in which to engage...playing Trivial Pursuit ( gutter minds , the lot of you; I  know  what you were thinking);  (c)  Sadly, it makes me feel good.  The idea that I am can stretch myself out on my living room floor and hear and feel the muscles and joints popping and stretching  BACK  into the shape they were in before I took a sabbatical...well, damn, but it makes me feel good about myself.  Plus, it helps with posture; and    (d)  I bought all those ******* DVD's, and I'm bloody well going to get my money's worth out of them.  Granted, my stomach, legs, thighs, arms, and back all hurt like hell right now, but I'm sure I'll be all suave and sexy by March.

"Hunh -- I guess I could sell an appendage or two to supplement my income."     ******  So, the soundtrack for  The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King  comes out today.  Will li'l Sonny be venturing out to buy said soundtrack?  More than likely.  Ignore the statement about the checkbook.  When music enters the equation, debt is justified.  When books enter the equation, debt is to be expected.    ******

       Suddenly I remember why I  hate  the holiday season:   food .    Think about this -- I am stuck in a quad of fat.  My birthday leads into Thanksgiving which leads into Christmas/etc. which leads into New Year's.  I believe that at this moment, my fridge contains more food in it in the form of leftovers than it has held in the entire three years I've been here.  And it's only going to get worse.  My family and friends (damn you all) get this cooking bug lodged up their collective asses and decide to cook 46 metric tons of food to feed eleven people...and then it falls to the people who do NOT reside at the principle establishment where said food is consumed to transport this food back to each respective home.    Cricket loves the food, but please -- don't make my puppy a porker.    ...and you people wonder why I prefer to volunteer at someplace like Stewpot for the holidays...I get to  GIVE AWAY  food, not keep it.

Anyway, if anything, this last post has made me realize that some people monitor this Blog thing closer than I thought.  Remind me never to put anything personal up here that could cause anxiety.  Buncha hooligans...  ******  RA evaluations are proceeding apace.  In the last two days, I have seen three of the four people I was the most afraid to have a one-on-one with, and they've all been well without incident.  One person even commented that they were "pleasantly surprised" with the level of professionalism I exude, because they were convinced I was tearin' it up, and having drunken sex with my RA's and residents on a regular basis.  [Okay, maybe not literally, but that's what it felt like I was being accused of.]  I just smiled and told this person -- in professional terms, of course -- that I have come to believe that they weren't the sanctimonious egotistical prat that they come across as being 90% of the time.  Civility coupled with politics.  Fek aff.  ******  The new Tori Amos CD and the 4-disc  The Lord of the Rings:  The Two Towers  both came out today.  I am $40 poorer for it.    ******  In an hour, I will go to the third celebratory birthday dinner in as many days.  God bless my expanding ass...

       Well, I finally bloody well did it.  -- y'ever have that certain someone, that special person who...you really can not explain why...but you've gotten close to them.  You share something, something completely inexplicable...something that defies a rational, logical definition.  This person, in my case, may be someone who you have parenthetically known for years.  Someone who you've known OF, but not really known.  Yet...you're brought together through circumstances that will make you feel an aneurysm coming on if you try and explain it.  This is a person who you have gotten to know REALLY well over the course of two and a half years...a person whose personality and yours may not have matched perfectly at first...but you've both grown.  And grown together...and towards one another.  A person who you trust implicitly...who you could be just at home with lying next to them in flannel pajamas as you would be sitting in the finest restaurant...who you can share your deepest darkest secrets with as well as mock the passersby with.  Someone who is YOU, but isn't you.  Who compliments your personality in ways you never knew you needed...who helps complete a circle you never noticed was an ellipse...  Someone who, despite your best efforts and calculated attempts to not...someone who you have developed true, real, and sincere feelings for.  ...and then you share said feelings, ready to take the risk and be shot down with.  ...and, after sharing said feelings, the response you're given lies somewhere between  "Oh, that's so sweet"  and pure  "But you're just a friend."    Yeah.   Happy freakin' birthday,  there, Sonny.  No wonder Christ died when He reached your age (33).  New beginnings, my flippant arse.   ...and now, I will go and drink.  Alone.  In the dark.

       So, it's been a couple of days.  I would lie and say that I've been busy what with my LIFE and all, but that'd be utter crap.  I've just been procrastinating.  Sue me.    ******  Today, I cleaned my apartment.  And we're talking full-on cleaning -- the floors were mopped and waxed; the countertops were all scrubbed; the kitchen sinks are now scrubbed out; the over top got scrubbed clean; lots of dusting on the wood objects was done; laundry -and- dry cleaning taken care of in one fell swoop; and I even cleaned out that second spare junk closet in my bedroom.  Now I can see the floor in there.  The only thing I neglected to clean was the bathtub.  But that's because Cricket will be getting a bath tonight, and I didn't want to clean it before she got cleaned.  That would just be, oh, dumb.    The reason I got all Crazy Cleaning Guy is because when I leave here for the holidays, I don't want to come home to dirt.  It's weird, yeah, but I'd rather spend a day BEFORE I travel getting everything all nice and shiny than to have to deal with dirt when I return.  It's a me thing.  I'm kooky like that.    ******  So, while I was cleaning, I decide to drink the coffee a friend gave me for the holidays.  However, she made a TERRIBLE faux pas.  See, she's known me for almost three years now.  She should be well-versed in my coffee drinking habits at this point.  However, she bought me the one style of coffee which I don'tt trust:   flavored coffee .  This whole Hazelnut, Irish Cream, blah blah blah...I don't TRUST flavored coffee, because there are no flavored coffee plants.  If I want my coffee to have a chocolate taste, I'll bloody well PUT cocoa in it, thank you very much.  Yet, she buys me... Peppermint  flavored coffee.  Peppermint.  --- so, in the spirit of the holiday season, I opt to try it.  And Pepperminty is isn't.  More like  UGH  flavored.  I never knew that coffe could taste THIS bad, especially coffee that  I  make.  I know the old adage of a poor workman blaming tools and all, but I just really had NO raw materials to go with here.    Therefore, Sonny's gonna have to make a better pot tonight to rid the taste of this putrid java from my memory.

       ...there is some freaky shyte going down in the men's restroom on the third floor of the College Center ...and  no , pagans, I don't mean THAT kinda "freaky shyte."   Minds  OUT  of the gutters, children...  Yesterday, the bathroom smelled like coffee.  Like some kind of hazelnut blend.  Normally, the aroma of coffee does not bother me at all (durh -- like no one could guess that).  But...in the BATHROOM?  And today, it looks like someone spilled powdered sugar on the floor.  Is someone sneaking in after hours and making waffles in the men's restroom?  I expect this kind of behavior when the students are HERE, but...*shrugs*  ******  TONIGHT...I go see  The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King .  Midnight showing.  My companions and I will be arriving at the theatre at approximately 11:00 pm, coffee in tow, and getting ready to stay up all damn night.  This means I will be hitting my bed around six or seven tonight.  -- shove off; I'm old and I need my rest.  Plus, I'm recuperating from a debilitating illness.  My body must relax.    ******  ...so, my favorite comment this time of year (from my friends who are stupid and don't work in higher education) always has to be,  "Gee, it must be nice to work in education -- you get off work when the students leave and don't have to come back until mid-January."   Well, actually, jackass, I am at work.  The offices stay open until the 22nd, and we come back on the 2nd.  And no, I am not spending (all) my time playing on Yon Internet, or watching movies in my office.    I have to handle the paperwork for room changes; students transferring out; students transferring in; handle all the maintenance we need to do during the break (YOU try scheduling the repainting of  SEVEN BUILDINGS  in a month); billing from damages; re-editing the training manuals...  ...and then, there's the helping of other people who may be a tad overwhelmed in their jobs and need assistance (*cough* firstyearprogram *cough*).    "Break" my hot little butt.

        Sonny Really Does Not Belong In The South   Sign #47  :  I laughed at the people walking to class today all bundled up like they were expecting a massive frozen mad storm.  Like, these people are strutting about in giant freaking PARKAS, gloves, ski caps, and probably thermal underwear like there is no tomorrow.    Me?  I just wear my swearter, suede jacket, and I grin like a fool because I love the cool weather.  Now, if I were in, say Chicago, NYC, or somewhere else where the cold weather was bitterly ooky, then I might have a different theory about the lack of warmth.  But, as it is...eh.  Whatever.

       Beware.  My mood is most foul today.  I think it's the weather, coupled with the fact that I actually got about nine hours of sleep last night.  MY body does not know how to react to being "relaxed."  Oh -- and I got the single most bitchy email from some f*ckwit student that I have gotten in months.  Comparatively, the students this year -- while completely absurd and lacking any common sense -- have been more-or-less courteous.  Not so much more, now.    And, my coffee is cold.  Must go refill.

       Today is a good day.  Much like all 33-year-old heterosexual men, I keep a pair of "skinny pants" in the back of my closet, hidden far away from the rest of my clothing, for fear of intimidating them.  These "skinny pants" were purchased a few years ago (in Grad School, for those of you with a Rosetta Stone for the timeline) and promptly fell into disuse due to, oh, my  ass  getting larger.  However, the looked good, they felt good, and gosh darn it, they were the pride of my "dressy" clothes.  Since arriving in Jackson, I have not put on said "skinny pants" for fear of becoming insanely depressed because they didn't fit.  But, my lethargic non-laundry-doing self was left with little choice this morning.  Try on the skinny pants, and wear them, or come to work in sweatpants.  Or nude.    -- and  dude ...yeah.  The SKINNY PANTS FIT.  What's more, is I have room left OVER in said skinny pants.  Rock on.  And my hotness factor increased by a level of twenty-seven points.    So, I'm celebrating by drinking an Egg Nog Latte.  Screw it -- I can afford to gain a pound or two.

       I had this really long rant to go on about, but now I'm just tired and want chocolate.  ******  BUT...allow me to just start off by saying that I am now officially financially bereft of any solvency.  Millsaps just announced that our insurance rates will go up in January.   By.  Twenty-nine.  Percent.  29%.    Almost a third.     This means also that all co-pays will double, and all prescription refills just (at least) doubled as well.  Couple this with the fact that in the three years I have been here, we have gotten one (1) raise...two and a half years ago...of 2%.  There have been no cost-of-living increases, and any time that additional duties are assumed, there has been no monetary -- or hell, any -- compensation.  Due to this, I am now going to bring home   less   money each month than I did when I started here...and I have not added or changed my payroll deductions at all.  Cricket and I are both about to have to start eating dog food.

       This will be the first of two (in a series -- collect 'em all) posts today.  Why?  Namely, because I have the  Return of the King  soundtrack blaring out through the speakers at my computer inspiring me to literary greatness, but also because I refuse to do anything productive at work, especially following a "break."  My sinuses and allergies are trying to compensate for me being in relative good health all summer, and they're on full-blown attack mode.    ******  SIGNS YOUR LIFE HAS BECOME A SELF-PARODY:  I noticed something this morning when I was getting dressed.    (Get your mind OUT of the gutters, children.)     My clothes...all the clothes I am wearing today came from Ye Olde Bananae Republike.  The socks.  Skivvies.  T-shirt.  Belt.  Pants.  Button down jacket (suede, to boot).  Jacket.  Hell, the only articles of clothing that aren't from the Banana are my glasses and shoes.  This, dear friends, is the end result of having a nice outlet mall, oh, three hours from your doorstep.    Last year (almost exactly a little over a year ago, in fact), I was in Birmingham to go see Tori Amos in concert (and meet up with a friend who I was ill-fated to eventually get a crush on and blah blah blah whoa-oh-oa-oh feelings etc.  ad nauseum  heartache yadda yadda move on).  ANYWAY, I got there a little early, and I decided to scope out the local sights that were not terribly far from the concert arena.  I'd seen the signs for this "Outlet Mall" several times before, but -- since I was normally on my way back to J-town when these signs came into my life and I was not particularly interested in spending any MORE money, I always opted to  not  take the road less traveled by (thereby going to what I thought must be an Outlet Mall with a selection of purchaseables on par with the average Shell gas station) and just jet on back to the land of crazed college students.  But, since She Who Must Not Be Named Ere I Choke Up and I were not slated to meet for an hour or so, I decided to go kill time.  "What do I have to lose besides a few scoffs at these simpletons and their shopping abilities?"  And...(in Comic Book Guy voice)  this turned out to be.... The.  Worst.  Idea.  Ever.    Holy Cats -- this place was like a shopping Mecca in the middle of a freakin' serial killer's dream locale.  The Outlet Mall (hereforeafter referred to as "The Bleak Discover Card Draining Zone") is located in what looks to be the outskirts of a gravel pit, down County Line Mule Trail 409 or something, next to the saddest excuse for an amusement park ever created ("Vision Land," which sounds like an optometrist's dream world).  TBDCDZ has the standard Outletty things -- shoes, books (where I bought the damn funniest book I've ever seen; Juice, you're getting a copy of this from Sonny Claus, bud), and a Banana Outlet.  A HUGE Banana Outlet.     -- and since I do feel the need to look my best for all the many dates I go out on  (translation:   zero ),  as well as looking good at work  (translation: after being kept up all night by the jackass stunts of college students, I HAVE to compensate for the dark circles under my eyes by looking as stylish as a mofo),   well...shirts at half-price?  A CASHMERE SWEATER FOR $20?  Belts, good nice pet-able leather belts, insanely priced at three for $30?    My car weighed a little bit more on the return trip than it did on the way over.  Didn't mind a bit that I got home at three in the morning wearing a coffee stain on my left shoulder from where I fell asleep while driving.    But, y'know, the fact that I now look like a walking billboard for the Gods of Style...I am disturbed.  I am bothered by the fact that I am wearing all similar labeled items.  It's like Grranimals for Adults.    Now, in my own defense, I have not nor shall I be a slave to A Label.  These are quality clothes that don't fall apart after three washings.  The fact they're all...from the same bloody place...well.  Then.  Only   I   know, and it is my shame to carry.  And now you all know.  Please feel free to mock at your own peril.

       Well, shit.  First my grandfather dies, then someone reminds me [not knowing of this first ending] that a book I've read for years -- Dave Sim's  CEREBUS  -- ends its 27+ year run this year.  In a month or two, as a matter of fact.  Then, I get an email update from Satellite News telling me that one of the TV shows that shaped my mind and sense of humor --  Mystery Science Theater 3000  -- will end its 14-year run on television tomorrow (all interested parties can read the thought-out "buh-bye's" from the cast  urlLink here ).  I feel the need to wear a protective cup now.  Anyone else wanna take a potshot at the ol' Sonnster?  Sheesh...

Known as a true son of the new 20th Century, my music started out melodic and folky but slowly got more dissonant and bizzare as I aged. I am a traveler and a neat freak, and very much hated those rotten eggs thrown at me after the premiere of "The Rite of Spring."

       For those of you who have asked about my grandfather, I thank you.  There is nothing new to report at this time.  For those of you who have asked where the angry ranting has gone, p*ss off, you whining little punkas.     The growls are still there, but right now, they're being overshadowed by the situation with Jay.  Lousy curmudgeony old coot won't decide whether or not to stick around or give up the ghost.  If I didn't know for a fact the old bastard's dying, I'd sue him for emotional distress and for giving me an ulcer.    ...and before you ask, yes, I  DO  hope that one day my grandchildren can say such things about me as well.  It will mean that they have learned about life, they accept the fact that everything is temporary, and that they rejoice in life enough to joke about death.  'Cause, y'know, "forever is a mountain we've yet to climb/tears are a part of what is yet to leave behind."

       We're interviewing people for the Senior RA position today and tomorrow.  I'm listening to the latest (and lamest) CD from  urlLink King's X , and realizing that I'm strung out like cheap laundry in a trailer park right now    The news about my grandfather has waffled from "slight recovery and things don't look as bleak" to the latest...which was my father calling to tell me that it might not hurt for me to go ahead an make sure I've got a bag packed, including a suit, because things don't look too good.  This latest news comes on the heels of an emotionally traumatic week, full of ups, downs, sideways shifts, and full-on emotional inversions.  It wasn't until this morning that I realized the reason I haven't slept for, oh, close to a week [and that what little sleep I have had has come through the magic of sleeping aides], and that I am so tense and on edge that I might as well start that heroin habit I seem to act like I'm on.    I finally almost came close to cracking when my mother called me last week [Wednesday, as a matter of fact] to start the "up/down" teeter-totter.  She told me that Jay wanted to make sure that I knew he loved me, that I always was -- as he put it -- "the apple of his eye" [being the eldest grandchild has a few perks, I guess], and that he remembered all the good times we shared [including a highly embarrassing viewing of  Snoopy, Come Home  when I was a Little Sonny...a story that I shan't share here, as it is quite goofy].    This just hit me like a ton of bricks, and I really would have preferred it if someone had just told me that I was actually going to be fired.  This was the first time that...well, the fact Jay is dying really felt real.  I guess in my mind I've mostly felt like he was just sick...again...and that, yeah, he might not recover, but that doesn't mean he's going to DIE or anything.  He'd just...y'know...be OUT for a while.  He might even be GONE...but not GONE gone.    But...now I know.  For as strong and as "He's ready I'm ready blah blah blah" as I've been, I know now that I'm going to  feel  my heart break when he's gone.  There's going to be a Jay-shaped void in my life.  This man, who has always been a constant source of joy, happiness, and whose very existence embodied to me the good memories of my childhood...I'll be left with only my memories, and there won't be that tangible presence in my life any more.  Plus, the old goat'll expect me to assist in the upkeep of the cemetery plot.  Bastard.    Additionally, once he's gone...I'll have no grandparents left alive.  These non-existent children of mine will never get the chance to meet their great-grandfathers or great-grandmothers.  The winter holidays will seem that much more cold with one less stack of gifts to hand out under the tree.  The circle of my life will grow just a little tighter.    Mortality blows.  Me and this "God" person are gonna have to have us a long damn chat one day.  I wonder if it would be considered a mortal sin to call said Creator of All Things a sucker-punching prat for giving us all such miniscule lifespans.  I mean, really -- think about it.  I'm thirty- *cough*  years old, and I'm just now starting to get a freakin' handle on a lot of things.  If I were born with maturity and intelligence, maybe I might not be as bitter as I am right now.  But...  Feh.  Someone bring me a damn Mac Cloud of the Clan Mac Cloud.  I want a Quickening.  Or Nestle Quik.  Something.

I'm about to go hitch up Cricket, take her for a walk, and maybe...MAYBE...I'll be awake enough to vent a little.    Urgh.

       So, in addition to working 16 hours yesterday...  ...I received some really bad information about my grandfather.    -- see, my grandfather had been living in a Retirement Community for about two years now.  After a strange readjustment to living with other people (I told him to just think about the fact he and his grandson were both living in dorms; he was not amused), he actually began to thrive in this community.  Since he'd been living alone after my grandmother died several years earlier, he had lost a lot of the vim & vigor his youthful older days possessed.  He essentially became a social recluse, and by moving to a place where he was FORCED to interact with other people (and people close to his age, to boot!), he began to take on some of the crotchety old goat mentality that I love about him so much.    Hey, when you decide that you're best friend is 92, and you're going to have to live one year longer than HE does just so you'd get to have more birthdays than he did...well, it did my heart good to hear him arguing, and to see him eating again.  However, in the last few months/ten weeks...his health has taken a turn for the worse.  He's developed what is termed "Dry gangrene" on his right foot.  The doctors would like to amputate, but his body would not be able to recover from the trauma, to say nothing of the fact of his spirit would be crushed.    The most humbling and touching moment we shared recently was over the Winter Break, where I had to go pick him up from the Nursing Home he'd been moved to.  ...yeah, due to the fact that this Nursing Home had better PT equipment, he had to forego the cushy little private room he had at the Retirement Center and into a room with two other men in this Nursing Home.  Anyway, I went to go pick him up to bring him to my parents' home for lunch on Chrimma Eve, and I had to help him out of the bed, into a wheelchair, out to the car, into the car, into the house, etc.  And, poor Jay...he is so physically weak, that he needed help when he had to use the restroom.    And here I thought, here I am with the man who held  me  and carried  me  and used to change  me  when I was a kid...and now, our roles were reversing.  I had to carry  him .  I had to help  him  to keep him from making a mess.  I found it strangely touching.  He was mortified.  I told him I'd just put it on his tab, and he'd owe me a drink later.  But...Jay's now in the hospital due to complications from pneumonia.  And word came down yesterday that it appears his liver is failing.    I know that I should be terrified about losing this man who was such a GREAT influence in my life, who shaped me in ways I can't even begin to explain, who used to let me play with a nail gun as a child...but somehow...somehow, all I can keep thinking is,  "He's  earned  this rest.  His time is drawing to a close.  He's missed my grandmother terribly since she left, and now, now they have a chance to be reunited.  He'll just fall asleep, and wake up in a better place."     ...but then, this bastard is so damn stubborn, he might just remove his own liver JUST to prove  that he's strong enough to get on without one.

       Full moon.  Craziness abounds.   THANK GOD THE STUDENTS AREN'T HERE.   ******  So, I have this friend...now, before I begin this story, I feel the need to provide an EDITOR'S NOTE, in that this is indeed an actual friend and not a pathetic attempt to veil trauma in my  own  life by claiming that a  FRIEND  is going through this and not me.  I fess up when it's trauma in my life.  I fess up when I have wild shenanigans in my life.    Anyway...I have this friend who is going through a REALLY rough time due to a horrid, bad, icky, nasty breakup.  She has a track record in the area of the heart that rivals my own -- somehow, we both [until recently, on my part] seemed to make the most jackass style decisions when it came to dating.  She attracts the WORST guys, and I [again, until recently] used to attract the WORST women.  Many of our respective claims on our bad attraction wasn't that we were shagging Hell's Angels or anything -- both of us seem to be masters of the Bad Timing, as well as masters of Just Not The Best Choice.  But I digress.  She [let's call her Lynn, 'kay] was married for about five years.  Lynn and her hubby were never what I -- or most carbon-based life forms -- would deem properly matched:  she was the strong, domineering, nigh-manipulative one, and he was the capitulative little mongoose who would have set himself on fire had she asked it.  The fought like cats and buffalo, but there was a FORM of love there.  Not the type of relationship *I* would have wanted, but hey -- it was their life, so they could do whatever they bloody well wanted to.  Now, at the time, Lynn knew this guy named...Dave.  Dave, whose spouse...Bunny..., and Lynn and her hubby were all buddies.  The women worked together at the same place, and the men-folk were the bread winning heroes.  However, there was a little twist:  Dave and Lynn secretly were attracted to each other, and weren't the most subtle about it.  -- now, I can't state whether or not they were DOING anything about said attraction (like, say,  boinking ), but there were always a LOT of raised eyebrows when they were in close proximity to each other.  Fast-forward to 2002.  Lynn & Steve divorce, Dave & Bunny divorce.  Lynn & Dave being shacking up with one another, yes, BEFORE all papers are finalized and every "I" is dotted and "T" crossed.  And they shag like mad puppies until January 1st of this year.  But, I'm getting a little ahead of myself.  Lynn states that she does not want a SERIOUS relationship, just a boink buddy.  Dave agrees, as he's been out of the dating loop for a while:  the last time he just dated?  Try 1987.  So, they agree to see other people, but still be very joined at the groin to one another.  Lynn starts seeing this guy named Joe, and Joe wants to microwave their relationship.  Joe wants the 2.3 kids and Till Death Do We Blah Blah Blah stuff.  Lynn just wants to spend time with someone who will buy her nice things and boost her ego, touting her as the sexiest thing since time began.  Dave's probably out trolling for bleached-blonde, huge boobied ho's right about this time.    Lynn and Joe continue to date (and yes, JUST "date" -- no nookie for the Joe) for months, in SPITE of the fact that she's just leading this poor schmoe on.  Joe eventually wises up (I believe his passive-aggressive term he used to describe Lynn was "manipulative bitch") and dumps Lynn, freeing Lynn and Dave to pursue more squishing in the sheets...which, ironically enough, they were both becoming more and more used to doing with one another, and they were developing strong feelings for each other.  -- okay, actually, they were ADMITTING to these feelings that blind men in Mozambique could have seen.    So, Lynn & Dave go on a lot of little happy vacations with one another, and they have what Lynne describes as the Best New Year's Eve Ever.  She & Dave go out gallivanting about the cityscape, holding hands and frolicking freely in expressing their love for one another.  The next morning, after they have breakfast, Dave informs Lynn she needs to leave the house.  Lynn, expecting that Dave meant that his kids were coming over and they might not need to see them in a compromising situation, asked him if she could come over later to innocently enough come by and spend part of the day watching TV with him and the kids.  -- now, keep in mind that Dave had introduced Lynn to his kids, his friends, and even took a trip to INTRODUCE HER TO HIS PARENTS.  This would lead one to assume that Lynn had attained a special place in the heart of Dave.    But, Dave told her that she might not be interested in coming over, as Betty was coming over.  Betty.  The other woman he'd been seeing and sleeping with.    Breaking not only the ONE cardinal rule about their relationship, but also pretty much effectively making that comment he made about not seeing anyone else and swearing blindly that she was the only person he was shagging come across as a -- whaddacallit?  Oh, yeah --   LIE  .    ...and thus, trauma/drama ensued, and the relationship is now...well, I'm not sure.  Despite the BEST recommendations of people [raises hand], Lynn would still take Dave back, because she can't imagine him out of her life.  She'd decided to hold herself to the belief that...ONE day, when they were BOTH ready...they'd settle down and have this idealized life that they both wanted.    Now...she's just in pain, and it kills me to see a friend hurt.  Okay, I want to scream  "I COULD HAVE BLOODY WELL TOLD YOU THIS WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU GAVE YOURSELF OVER TO THAT SMARMY LITTLE PRAT,"  but...eh.    There are a LOT more details to this, but now you know the gist of it all.  And now I have to get coffee.    More ranting later.

       This is called me NOT doing my work today.  All I want to do is take a nap, and then drink cocoa while watching my  24  Season Two Box Set DVD's.  And then nap some more.  But, since I have to be -- what's that word?  Oh, yeah:  responsible  -- here I am at work, staring at a stack of paperwork.    Feh.  ******  Many of you have asked about the little cartoons based on my inane prattlings, as supplied by "Mitchell Rowsdower."  So, for those of you who have complimented and questioned, here's the skinny on this little punka:  - no, he is not a professional cartoonist [and once he reads that, he will be insufferable.  He never lacked for an ego before, but once he knows that people think he doodles for cash, he will be a beastie to live with.  Sorry, Alley]  - he and I used to combine our talents (he, as the King of Pictionary, and me, as the wordsmith) on a little comic strip/comic book/graphic novel/thing called  Damsel , which started off as an almost parody of the Austin Powers craze [God almighty, does that date us] but -- in true "Pop Will Eat Itself" nature -- the characters soon became these friends in this little fun strip with their own lives and backstories.  What became of it?  What stopped it?  Grad School (on my part), mostly.  Something about how since I had to write all intelligent papery-things 24/7, the notion of me sitting down at a keyboard for hours coming up with a fictional world and its backstory made me have involuntary muscle spasms.  There are still 2-3 little gems of ideas kicking about in my head, and I -- occassionally -- will sit down and write a sentence or two on them.  Mitch & I were planning at one time, way the crap back when we were young, foolish, and had disposable incomes, on publishing the silly thing.  Maybe one day we might just get around to doing that.  [Alley?

        THE FIRST OF THREE REALLY-KINDA-BIG-ISH OBSERVATIONS:    "Hi.  My name is Sonny, and I am a caffeine-aholic."   -- yeah, right.  "Big whoop," I hear you saying. "Like that's news to ANYONE."  But, y'see, I never knew how insanely true it was until yesterday.  Or, rather, approximately 4:30 this morning.  A quick recap for those of you with ADD:  I like coffee.  A lot.  So much so that when I was an undergrad, at one point a friend of mine and I had a drinking contest.  Now, whereas others of my age group and limited mental capacity [translation:   dumb freshmen boys ] were having drinking contests incorporating White Man's Firewater, he and I had a drinking contest over coffee.  It seems that this wee bastard thought he could out-drink ME, and, well, my friends weren't going to tolerate this pathetic posturing prat, and so they arranged a drinking contest to see who could ingest the most coffee in a 24-hour period.  Armed with a panel of judges, as well as the impartial opinions and verifications of faculty and staff members of our college who really should have known the hell better and not tolerated our shenanigans, we began out contest.  I, of course, kicked his arse.  In the course of twenty-four hours, he wussed out after five pots.  Me.  Eight.  And a half.  Do the math, kids:  that's theoretically 100 cups of coffee.  Due to this one day, I don't think I'll   ever   have to worry about certain digestive problems that occur with the onset of advanced age.  Fortunately,we never tried anything as insane as this while I was still in puberty.  Otherwise, I'd have gotten stuck at 5'2" and never grown.  Anyway, in spite of my love of the java, I am NOT the type of person who HAS to have "a cuppa" first thing in the morning, or otherwise I'd eviscerate anyone that comes near me.  In fact, I've been told that first thing in the morning, I'm somewhat coherent and moderately tolerable.  [Must come from living in mortal terror of having to go to the hospital at all hours of the night...every...evening...of...my...life, and therefore my facilities kick in as soon as my eyelids open.  God bless living on campus.]  I don't threaten the lives of those around me before I have my 2-3 cups of coffee, and my dog does not run away to hide under the bed when I roll out of bed.  All things considered, I'm fairly cuddly.  This past weekend, I spent Friday night and Saturday at  urlLink The University of Mississippi , to attend RADCoM [the Resident Assistant Drive-In Conference of Mississippi, a little convention for the RA's].  We lodged our little Millsapian butts at the Days Inn of Oxford [big spenders, we are] for Friday evening, rather than drive up to Oxford at the crack of dawn.  As is now the "in style" thing to do, the room came equipped with a coffee pot -- one of those little 4-cup deals.  This caused me great joy, as this meant that in the morning, I could have my normal amount of black gold before having to deal with screaming, cheerful, and joyful college students.  I love those who love what they do, but damn.  They can be a noisy lot.    However, I forgot that the quality of the coffee that comes in-room is...well, bad.  It tasted only slightly better than what I imagine drinking water that comes out of a drainpipe in the French Quarter the weekend of Mardi Gras would taste like.  The coffee available at the continental breakfast of the hotel was not much better.  There's only so much one can do to dress up Folger's.  This meant that I would need to either find a decent coffee shop fast, or just go without.  And, since Oxford has this "issue" with chain restaurants, my blessed Starbucks was going to be  in absentia .    So, Saturday, February 28, 2004, I went without caffeine.  ...yeah, okay.  I ate a chocolate chip cookie.  And had about 6 ounces of a Coke.  But that was it.  Surprisingly, my day was not wretched.  I was a little sluggish by the end of the day, but other than that?  I suffered no ill effects.  I wasn't any more bitchy than I usually am, I did not call for the decapitation of anyone around me, and I managed to contribute to the conference in a professional and dignified manner.  This thrilled me to no end.  Here, I thought was the herald of a new day.  A new era in Sonny-dom.  No longer would I have to get up and grind the beans everyday.  No longer would 37% of my paycheck be direct-deposited to Cups.  No longer would I have my hands automatically assume the "I'm-holding-a-hot-mug" position.  Yes, I was free.  Free, to experience the joys of using my tastebuds again.     ...this, of course, all changed when I woke up at 4:30 in the morning with the worst damn splitting headache I could imagine.  Oh, this was not a headache set on by my   urlLink trigeminal neuralgia  .  No, this was the headache that only a caffeine-swilling, Gen-X cynic can have.  It hurt like a beastie.  I got up, took three Alleve, and prayed for swift death.  After eventually falling back to sleep, the first thing I did when I woke up this morning was make a full 12-cup pot of my Organic Sumatra Mandheling, and drink the whole pot while watching the fourth disc in the  Angel  Season Three DVD set.    Welcome to my world.  We have good coffee, and we're learning our limits.  Care for a cuppa?    LESSON ONE:  DENY NOT WHAT YOU ARE.  IN MY CASE, I LIKE -- AND NEED -- COFFEE.  I AM THEREFORE AN ADDICT.

       No, I'm not dead.  Sod off.  I just have to ask this question, though -- HOW is it that I can go for DAYS without anything resembling a smile crossing my face?  All during the daylight hours, due to stress, trauma, and out-and-out MADNESS in the office, I have been angry, mad, and nursing an ulcer [this is not an exaggeration].   I've never wanted to shake some people SO BADLY in order to try and get some common sense into their skulls, and then -- BAM! -- walking home, I have an RA of mine call me a "Hoochie" (out of love, I assure you), and I remember why I love working with these students?  Amazing.  One little word, and my heart gets lightened.

       Goat.  Goat tastes good.  -- see, last weekend, I went to the local coffee roastery, and they had this rather large-ish sign up that stated  "ASK ME ABOUT MY GOAT."     Never one to pass up a perfect opportunity to ask about farm animals, I inquired about said goat.    It turns out that "goat" does not, in fact, refer to any animal which bleats or eats random bits of material lying about.  "Goat," in this instance, refers to the fact that the coffee roastery took a lot of miscellaneous coffee beans, tossed 'em together, and roasted them.  Amazingly, this hodgepodge of flavors tastes GREAT.  So much, in fact, that I bought a pound of goat beans.    Saturday, I made a pot of goat.  Now, the thing that I love about the weekend is that once I get up and make coffee, after I settle onto the couch, I could just fall back asleep.  I can not do this on the weekdays (like I wanted to today) due to this "employment" problem I have.  The sad part of this tale is that after I was all nuzzled and nestled into my big comfy couch, I was ready to just kick back and fall asleep...but there was a half-full pot of coffee still sitting there, ready to be ingested.  When inquired about why I didn't just go to sleep, my response -- without thinking -- was,  "What, and sacrifice my goat?"   Heh.  Goat.

       Good God.    Now I  *KNOW*  this day is going to be quite maddening.  Submitted as evidence -- the text of this message I received this morning:   Hi Sonny,   I was walking in b/w Sullivan Harell and Murrah and I saw a cat caught in a cage in the bushes.  There was a plaque that said 'MS Animal Rescue' or something like that.  I don't know if there is a movement to remove the cats from campus or provide some interesting meat in the caf, but I just thought I would let you know.  I really wanted to set him free, but I decided against it b/c I don't know the circumstances surrounding his captivity.  I don't know why I'm telling you--guess it's  a feline res life issue.  Let me know if you hear anything.   Meow-   Erin

       In the name of all humanity -- will SOMEONE please fix the bloody AC unit in the Student Center?    Our air has been out for about three hours now.  And, since when the building was constructed they  conveniently  forgot to incorporate  WINDOWS THAT OPEN , it is fast turning into a pressure cooker in here, both from the temperature -and- the temperament of the individuals stuck in here in this stuffy humidity-laden building.  Ugh.  ******  Hokay -- rant of the hour:  this is the 21st century.  We don't have personalized jet packs, nor do we have rocket cars to propel us to Sirius IX and back, but we do have the ability to utilize little plastic cards (debit/check cards) to pay for items now.  So, why, in the name of the sacred Kenyan AA Organic coffee I got this morning, do people STILL...WRITE...CHECKS...IN...PUBLIC?!?!?!??  Case in point:  yesterday, I decided to go shopping.  This, in and of itself, is nothing new or noteworthy.  As far as I am concerned, shopping centers exist for people like me who are clothes, shoes, books, and electronic gizmo junkies.  I might not buy anything, but I will visit the same stores again and again.  Anyway, since it is now March in Mississippi [and the start of the nine-hour-long Spring season which then catapults into the 260-day-long Summer season], this means the temperatures will start to climb into the 400's during the course of the day.  Those of you who know me well enough also know that my wardrobe can come across as rather monochromatic [black] with a little variation [dark/navy blue, grey, or dark/forest green].  I prefer to wear long sleeved button-down shirts, as -- in my opinion -- short-sleeved button down shirts should be reserved for accountants, used-car salespeople, or others ho happen to look better in them than *I* do.  So, I decide to go trolling for "light" or "summer" colored clothes, to supplement the three (3) non-dark colored shirts that I currently own.  -- now, at this time, I feel the need to add a comment.  I am an albino.  That guy from POWDER has seen more sun than I have.  This is not only the unfortunate side-effect of being in an office an awful lot, but also because it's just now starting to get sunny [ha] outside.  Additionally, I feel a little bit...uncomfortable...sitting outside in the sun, clearly for the sole purpose of getting some pigmentation, while my students are frolicking, tanning, and/or making out in the same grass.  Part of this can be contributed to body image issues, and part of it can be contributed to the fact that these kids just  REALLY  don't need to see their AD in a seemingly partially disrobed state.    But I digress [TM 2004 Peter David].    So, I'm in Old Navy, looking for bright, cheery clothing that won't make me look like I'm trying to come across as younger than my already-way-too-freakin'-close-to-mid-thirties self is, or that I'm jaundiced.  I decide upon a few bright-ish colored "polo" shirts, and a pair of khaki shorts to match [I can see your eyes getting bigger and that grimace settling across your face.  P*ss off -- even *I* have to wear shorts when it's THAT hot outside].  I also grab myself a nice little long-sleeved button-down shirt (on sale at some insane price that I'd be a fool to pass up), and I head to the check-out lane.  And then, I remember why I   HATE   shopping here.  First, there are the ADHD children running about the line like they just ate a three-foot tall Pixie Stix, stepping on my toes, and bouncing off my legs like we're in some twisted pinball experiment.  Then, there are the 67-person-long lines, and it always feels like I'm in line with the in-bred mongoloid manager's cousin trainee running the cash register.  EVERY time.  Then, there's the fact that the people who shop at said establishment [at least, here in J-town] ARE -- in some ways -- the one trying to recapture their youth by ignoring the fact that they've had 4.3 kids [and all of them are currently engaged in p*ss*ng me off -- see above] and that there is NO WAY they will fit into those capri pants.    And then, on top of it all, JUST to spite me PERSONALLY...they all write checks.  All of them.  -- okay, there was the one "grand-mamma" in front of me who paid in the change she took out of a plastic Zipoloc bag in her purse, but I forgive her.  She's old.  She'll die soon.  She should get her kicks where she can, and if she pays for $60 worth of clothes for the kids with pennies that smell like Juicy Fruit, well then -- more power to her!  But these people who WRITE CHECKS...and then the check has to be approved...and they NEVER partially pre-fill the amount out...and then they ask to whom the check should be made out to --   as if they've forgotten where it is they're shopping!!!  ...and then the manager, the associate manager, the Pope, and Mothra all have to come and authorize the check...AND... they have a bloody debit card sitting IN THE PURSE, in the checkbook they just wrote the check out of!!!!!!   Look, I can sort of understand the paranoia of some people who think the guv'mint's gonna track them down through every swipe of the stripe [I was a big X-Files fan, after all], but for the love of all that is sacred and holy... WHY!  WHY!  WHY!!!!!  must you, Soccer Mom, write checks when a perfectly acceptable and FASTER method of payment is staring you in your Mary-Kay-OD'd face?  Why?!?!?!?  Save those checks for when they'll be needed -- like, paying for your kid's therapy bills.  Or Jenny Craig.    Sheesh...

        urlLink Here's  the link.  Same-Sex Marriage Vaulted Into Spotlight   By David Von Drehle and Alan Cooperman Washington Post Staff Writers Monday, March 8, 2004; Page A01   As recently as late January, the same-sex marriage fight was something people could track on a calendar, a matter of court dockets, legislative schedules and months between major developments.    But then, in quick succession . . .   The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court refused to accept a "civil unions" alternative in that state, which prodded President Bush to mention the issue in his State of the Union speech, which inspired the mayor of San Francisco to allow same-sex weddings for thousands of couples, which pushed Bush to endorse a constitutional ban.   Now the terrain shifts weekly, daily, hourly. The mayor of New Paltz, N.Y., a house painter by trade, decided 10 days ago to solemnize same-sex unions, beginning with a couple of his customers. New York Gov. George E. Pataki (R) picked up the hot potato and fired it at his likely next opponent, state Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer. But before Spitzer could respond, the action shifted to Portland, Ore., where same-sex couples began lining up for marriage licenses.   Jabs and counterjabs, bids and raises: This momentous culture clash has become a sort of cyclone, in which pro and con fuel and feed on each other in a rapidly tightening circle. To understand how things have happened so quickly, look no further than this pattern of action and reaction.   The issue is now "six months further down the road than we anticipated," said Family Research Council President Tony Perkins, a leading opponent of same-sex marriage. "We did not think we would be at the point of licenses being issued this early. So we had to accelerate our plans."   Writer Andrew Sullivan, an influential advocate of same-sex marriage rights, said something similar on his Web site recently: "Not so long ago, I thought I had a handle on this movement," he wrote. "But now it has a life of its own."   To many Americans, things seemed to be moving quickly on the marriage front even last fall, when the Massachusetts high court ruled, 4 to 3, that the state's constitution guaranteed equal marriage rights for same-sex couples. The ruling started a 180-day countdown to the United States' first legally approved gay weddings.   But that was only the beginning.   On Jan. 18, 10 days after being sworn in as mayor of San Francisco, a young millionaire businessman named Gavin Newsom traveled to Washington for a meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. During his visit, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) invited him to attend Bush's State of the Union speech.   "The speech turned pretty dramatically when the president brought up the Defense of Marriage Act and quite unequivocally talked about defending marriage as between a man and a woman," Newsom remembered in a recent interview. "I started looking around as people were giving standing ovations and applauding and cheering wildly. . . . I thought I was on another planet."   Newsom said he called his press secretary back in San Francisco, Peter Ragone, and his chief of staff, Steve Kava, and asked them: "Could you believe that speech?" As Ragone remembered it, Newsom said: "We gotta do something."   Bush's speech had not sprung from nowhere. The president was under intense pressure from religious conservatives -- a crucial constituency of his -- to endorse a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. As angry as Newsom was about the State of the Union speech, it disappointed some key Bush supporters who wanted more concrete language. Longtime conservative activist Gary Bauer recalled that he and others were frustrated by White House efforts to "fine-tune the message" on a matter of principle.   Newsom returned home determined to answer the Bush speech in a very public way. He instructed his staff to compile legal and historical background materials. The mayor believes bans on gay marriage today resemble bans on interracial marriage before 1967. Many of the same arguments the U.S. Supreme Court used to strike down racial marriage laws could be applied to this new controversy.   In fact, the first legal blow against bans on interracial marriage had been struck in California in 1948, when the state Supreme Court overturned the state's anti-miscegenation law. The same state constitution, Newsom and his lawyers thought, ought to protect same-sex marriage, even though California voters had passed a referendum limiting marriage to unions of one man and one woman.   Newsom hashed it out in a spirited exchange with about five of his senior staff members. Some aides advised him not to defy the referendum. But according to press secretary Ragone, the mayor said simply: "It may not be the political thing to do, but it's the right thing to do."   After consulting with Kate Kendell of the National Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco and other gay rights leaders, Newsom authorized the marriage on Feb. 12 of Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon, legends of the lesbian rights movement whose relationship had endured more than 50 years. They were the first of more than 3,200 couples wed so far at San Francisco City Hall.   "By putting a human face on discrimination, we would show that gay and lesbian loving couples had the same rights as heterosexual couples," the mayor reasoned recently.   He also fired up the opposition.   Blindsided   The first San Francisco wedding was on a Thursday, but Newsom did not announce it until the next day. The idea was to make it impossible for opponents of same-sex marriage to get to court before the long Presidents' Day weekend. (This was explained by a Newsom aide, who, like many proponents of gay marriage, did not want to discuss strategies and tactics on the record.) When the news broke, many opposition leaders were caught flat-footed. "It absolutely did blindside us," said Glenn T. Stanton, the point man on marriage issues for James Dobson's Colorado-based organization, Focus on the Family. "We did not have anyone in California."   Half a dozen Focus on the Family staff members -- as well as Family Research Council's Perkins, Concerned Women for America President Sandy Rios and many other activists -- had been in Boston that week trying to build support for a state constitutional amendment to trump the Massachusetts high court's decision that said all adults, including gays, have a right to marry their chosen partner. They failed to make any real headway, but Perkins said they believed they had fought gay-rights groups to an "inconclusive draw."   That Thursday evening, Feb. 12, Perkins flew to Baton Rouge, La., for a rally supporting public displays of the Ten Commandments. The next morning, he awoke to the news that hundreds of gay couples were lining up to marry in San Francisco.   At first, Perkins and other conservative leaders assumed that it would be a short-lived publicity stunt. Surely Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) would quickly terminate the spectacle.   Instead, Schwarzenegger consulted his attorney general, who went to the California Supreme Court, which declined to take emergency action, finding no "irreparable harm" in what Newsom was doing.   "We had kept our muscle focused on Massachusetts, thinking that this afternoon or tomorrow or the next day someone is going to step in and say, 'Pardon us, but California law is quite clear and you can't be doing this,' " Stanton said. Instead, the nation's airwaves were filled, day after day, with images of happy couples.   Conservatives were also infuriated by comparisons to the civil rights movement. As they hit the talk-radio circuit in a battle over whether what was happening in San Francisco was civil disobedience or just plain anarchy, elected leaders nationwide pondered what to do.   Both sides were energized. The San Francisco weddings added urgency to efforts in 35 states to strengthen the traditional definition of marriage; legislators in Wisconsin and Georgia quickly moved toward enacting state constitutional amendments. But promoters of same-sex marriage, such as lawyer Evan Wolfson, executive director of the group Freedom to Marry, also began fielding calls from mayors, commissioners, county clerks and counsels.   Though reluctant to discuss the advice he offered, Wolfson said recently that he encouraged some to consider granting marriage licenses and advised others not to, depending on the laws and circumstances of each state. "Like all civil rights movements, we try to think strategically about achieving our goal of equal justice," he said.   Even Wolfson was surprised, though, by news from Sandoval County, N.M., that the clerk there had decided to license same-sex marriages. On the other side of the fight, Perkins of the Family Research Council reacted to this "lawlessness," as he called it, by convening a conference call among a loose confederation of religious conservatives dedicated to blocking gay marriage, known as the Arlington Group. That call was a watershed, several participants said. After collaborating informally for six months, Arlington Group leaders jointly hired or lent several full-time staff members to work out of the Family Research Council's office on G Street NW and ponied up money to buy newspaper ads.   They also stepped up pressure on the White House.   For weeks, presidential adviser Karl Rove had been assuring them that Bush would endorse a constitutional amendment -- when the timing was right. Administration officials say Bush's support came with an "if necessary" clause.   As the days ticked by, Arlington Group members said, they began to wonder whether Bush would meet the end-of-February deadline they said Rove had promised.   "Clearly there was a sense," Bauer said, "that this was out of control."   The Shortened Timeline   On Tuesday, Feb. 24, Bush called on Congress to pass the Federal Marriage Amendment, finally satisfying the conservative activists -- but deeply offending Mayor Jason West of tiny New Paltz, N.Y. Last summer, as the first Green Party mayor in state history, West said he told friends in the gay community, "I want to perform marriages." He instructed the village attorney to study the legality, and the lawyer decided there was no reason not to move forward.   The first warm days of spring seemed like a lovely time for it.   "But national events sent that timeline up a little bit," West said. After Bush's call for a constitutional ban, the mayor said, "I couldn't wait any longer to add my voice to this growing chorus."   At the time of Bush's statement, West was painting the home of Billiam van Roestenberg and Jeffrey McGowan. While standing in their dining room, which is decorated with busts of Benjamin Franklin and other patriotic flourishes, West asked whether his customers would like to be wed.   A week later, West seemed unconcerned to find himself facing 19 misdemeanor criminal charges for stretching -- or defying -- the marriage laws of New York. His actions may speed the issue of same-sex marriage to the high court of New York, just as Newsom has pumped the issue onto California's high court docket.   Moreover, West's action prompted Attorney General Spitzer to announce his view that New York law, while forbidding same-sex marriages, requires recognition of such marriages performed elsewhere -- a major step that was nearly drowned out in the din of activity last week. And West has company, as near as Ithaca, N.Y., and as distant as Portland, Ore.   "This is the fastest-growing civil rights movement we've seen in a generation," he said. "I don't think I'd be able to live with myself if I backed down because of a jail term."   Inside the Cyclone   The warring factions disagree on whether this cyclone ultimately helps or hurts one side or the other.   Gay rights advocate Wolfson said the flurry of steps and countersteps -- of which he says he expects still more -- helped his cause by making the issue concrete.   "I think the right wing is terrified that when this changes from a hypothetical to a reality, more fair-minded people will say that the government should not be trying to take away" the thousands of marriage licenses that have been granted, he said. The countermeasures, he charged, are a matter of his opponents "trying to stampede people."   Not all gay leaders feel as sanguine about these events. For example, Rick Garcia, political director for Equality Illinois, worries that too much focus on the marriage issue could jeopardize legislation outlawing discrimination against gays. "Sometimes, it makes our job harder," he said.   For Paul Weyrich, one of the founders of the religious conservative movement in politics, the events in San Francisco and since are a kind of political Pearl Harbor, a sudden attack that first rocked, then unified, the country.   "I must say, we ought to have the mayor of San Francisco on our payroll," Weyrich said. Newsom "really energized people in a way that would not have been possible. I think that President Bush would not have acted when he did. . . . I think in one sense the activists on the other side may have outsmarted themselves."   Which assessment is correct is a later chapter in this suddenly fast-moving book. But there is no question that the book will belong on the history shelf -- no longer a mere curiosity. And as some gay-rights advocates noted, how fast it all feels may depend on your perspective.   For Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon, the events of recent weeks were more than 50 years in the making.   Staff writers Evelyn Nieves in San Francisco, Robert E. Pierre in Chicago and Mike Allen in Washington and special correspondent Michelle Garcia in New York contributed to this report.

        THE SECOND OF THREE REALLY-KINDA-BIG-ISH OBSERVATIONS:    That silly little band with that "Closing Time" song may have just gotten it right.    Submitted as evidence:   Cerebus. Mystery Science Theater 3000. Sex and the City. Angel. Buffy  -- even on DVD.  Star Trek: Deep Space Nine  (on DVD).  The Lord of the Rings  trilogy -- even on DVD. My grandfather.  2004 is shaping up very fast to be a year involving a series of endings.  If I were to sit down and map out the past twelve month, making note of the vast, vast number of things in my life...important, valuable [to me] things which have shaped and direct me and my personality...these things which have helped to make me the Sonny that I am...and how most of them have ended, running their full course...  Serialized, sequential television will hold no longer hold interest for me, save for  24 .    My reading habits will take a nose-dive [thereby making me read a buncha nerd texts, things that deal with issues in higher education -- and I'll be reading these for pleasure, God help me].  My grandfather, one of the single most influential people in my life, has gone on to finally rest, leaving me with a lot of memories...and helping to sever any strong ties I hold to this region.  ...okay, so all of this has made me a tad melancholy.  I look behind me, and I see nothing but a series of closed doors.  And yes, heathens, I am well aware of that whole "door close/window open" dichotomy that so many well-intended people espouse.  It might upset me more if I did not know that these doors close (for the most part) of their own free will.  Some things -- like Jay -- have run a natural course, and there comes a time when such things  DO  end.    I do not find myself diminished due to these closings.  They are helping, in some ways, to propel me forward.  I draw strength from their memories and their lasting lessons [even in the case of  BUFFY , which has made me quite quick with quips], and there is a quiet smile hidden behind the lines surrounding my eyes of late.    There are people in my life who are important to me and who give me strength to carry on and keep going [hi, Katie], and these people...they help me to see the endings for what they are:  opportunities for growth.  The endings are, thankfully, ending.    The beginnings will start soon enough.

       Because there are at least four of you people who give something akin to a " crap " about me and my job search, here is the latest information for your enjoyment...   UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA , Student Development Specialist -- phone interview held on 4/24.  I should hear back this week if they'd like to invite me for a campus interview.    APPALACHIAN STATE UNIVERSITY,  Residence Education Instructor/Area Coordinator -- phone interview held 4/21.  Again, I should hear back this week if they'd like to invite me for a campus interview.   MIAMI UNIVERSITY (Ohio),  Coordinator of Residence Life -- phone interview held 4/sometime (a coffee spill blurs the date).  I have heard nothing from them since the beginning of this month.    MERCER UNIVERSITY  -- they've called everyone BUT me, it seems...and I was told the position was on "hold,"whatever the hell that means  EMORY UNIVERSITY  -- no communication from them yet, but my resume did only get sent off early last week.  GEORGIA TECH  -- no communication from them yet, although their website shows the search for the position continues.  I'm 99% sure I can write this one off.

       This is going to be one of the most difficult things I have ever typed.  Please bear with me.   Many of you have been with me through some very difficult patches of my life.  Many of you have become closer than family to me, and your love and support these past three years has been something that I could not have lived without.  In many ways, I owe you all my life, both personally and professionally.  Heartache, headaches, and gut-punches...we've been there for each other, and we've grown to be more than co-workers.  We've become friends.     We've laughed, we've cried, we've yelled, we've been through some of the most random and bizarre moments (i.e.:  the flooding of New South).   Therefore -- with shaking hands and as all the blood drains from my fingers due to my nerves being shot -- it is with nothing shy of remorse that I announce that next year...you'll be dancing without me.  I am leaving Millsaps, effective May 11, 2004.  I'm sticking around to help you all in the closing of the halls, but in the fall, the College will be Sonny-less.   I can't give more information that this right now, and even though I know that some of you will be suffering through bouts of depression, anger, and some of you little pookas will be throwing a celebration, I ask please -- give me a few moments (translation: days) of quiet before the questions arise.     It's been an honor.       And dammit, now   I'm   crying.

       Ten years ago.  Ten.   urlLink Kurt Cobain  died ten years ago.  Say what you will about the man's personal life (which you have no right to judge, by the way), but his music and his life touched and gave a voice to a generation.  Mine.

       Sorry for the lack of an update lately; things have been hectic here in the Cuban Dead Poets Society (repression of information, don't question just do, etc).     UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA :  I have an on-campus interview set for next Wednesday.  This is the one job I am REALLY angling for (due to the fact I can work on my Ph.D. as well as be employed).  APPALACHIAN STATE UNIVERSITY :  told me that I suck and that they were going to hire another person.  Boo.  MERCER UNIVERSITY :  told me that I suck and that they were going to hire another person.  Boo.  urlLink  LYNDON STATE COLLEGE  :  had a phone interview with these monkeys today.  Went well.    TULANE UNIVERSITY:   am expecting to hear from them by week's end.  THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI :  Oh, shut up.  It's employment.

       I have accepted that fact that I am still reading and enjoying comic books at age 33.  I have accepted the fact that I can and have argued (and will probably continue to argue) the minutiae about  Star Trek: Deep Space Nine ,  Buffy, the Vampire Slayer , and Marx Brothers movies.  I have accepted the fact that my snobbery for coffee forces me to purchase nothing but freshly roasted whole beans.  I have accepted the fact that my snobbery for beer forces me to ignore anything brewed in this country.  I have accepted the fact that I prefer organically grown food.    However, I never knew how big of a nerd I am and how totally, totally, totally "into" grammar, sentence structures, and the like until I started reading and laughing out loud at  urlLink Eats, Shoots and Leaves .    Some of you will need this book (if your emails are any indication of your writing skills, God help graduate schools everywhere).  Some of you don't need this book but will appreciate the refresher.  Some of you need neither the refresher or the book, but will laugh hysterically at the mockery of the grammatically challenged.  And the uniquely UK slant of the book.  Read it.  Buy it.  Buy several copies.  Give them as gifts.    Join the revolution.

       Time for a little re-pluggage here, folkses.  After revamping the layout a little on my blog, I took time out of my busy schedule here at UGA to answer a few emails from some friends of mine.  One individual in particular, a Mr. Eric Fritzius, had sent me quite a few missives.  Personally, I don't consider this to be a problem in the least bit.  No sirree.  Eric n' me go way back.    In fact, I think he "blames" me in part for his construction of what is quite possibly one of the funniest blogs I have ever read:   urlLink Tales from the Liberry .  See, Eric works in a public library.  Whereas I just deal with social reprobates, bohemians, and the dregs of society in college, Eric gets to see these same types of people all growed up and trying to function in society.  We're kind of like a "one-two" punch with our commentary on the lives of the people we interact with.  However, Eric is a MUCH better writer than I am.    As Eric has stated before, there was an Evil Triumvirate of Co-Hosts for the late, lamented  Four Colour Theatre  (heard on WMSV in Starkville).  Long before Joss Whedon came up with the idea of the Three Evil Nerds (for reference, see  Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Season Six, now available on DVD), Eric, Joe, and I were there.  "O.N.'s," if you will.    Joss Whedon has just started writing a brand new X-Men comic book for Marvel Comics ( Astonishing X-Men , the first X-Men book to have a  REASON  behind its title), and Eric emailed me to ask me if I'd read it.  He also sent me an email showing me Joe's new puppies.  Ergo, the nostalgia kick that started this entire somewhat free-form email.  Ergo, the reference to the Three Evil Nerds.  Ergo, the comment about me getting to be Andrew.  Ergo, the --    Oh, shush.  I've not had enough caffeine this morning.  So what if this is rambling.   Now excuse me.  I must go design RA Training.

       Greetings, one and all.  Yes, this is an Official Update (TM) from the Sonnster.  I apologize that my blog has been -- well -- empty as of late.  You see, changing careers, moving, getting set up, going heavily in debt...all these things tend to eat up one's time and energy.  And stress.  They cause stress.  Let's not forget about the stress.  Did I mention the stress yet?  Yeah.  Anyway, let's do a quick bullet-point update on the Life of Sonny.  Grab a cup of coffee (or your favorite beverage of choice), and get comfy.  This might take a minute or two:  - GEORGIA ON MY MIND:  you know, aside from the fact that people here don't dress or act like simpletons, one might think one was in Mississippi.  Oh, to be sure, there are a few good things about MS (most of these "good things" are undoubtedly reading this at this time), but GA -- has, so far, been a very warm and inviting place.  Many might claim that GA is just MS without the negative image, but let's not forget this state was originally settled as a   penal colony  , 'kay?  The people here are very well dressed, polite (to a degree -- MS does win for being more hospitable), and I don't see the typical "Wal-Mart" crowd everywhere I go.    Atlanta, of course, is just damn spectacular.  I've only been over there once since moving, but I assure you, many, many, many, many more trips will be in my future.  Booyah!     - NOT EXACTLY OLYMPIC:  Athens is just...cool.  This place screams "college town," and as more than one of my friends have remarked, this is the town I was born to live in.  Artsy, folksy, alterna, and just OUT there enough.  I really can not explain how at home I feel here.  It's almost as if my entire life, my spirit has resided here.  I feel renewed, refreshed, and reinvigorated to just be alive.  -- and more than one of you [hi, Corrie] will know that it has been   YEARS   since I have felt this good...about me, about my life, and about the way things are going.    People, I smile more often than not.  THAT alone should illustrate the point.   - IT'S PRONOUNCED "UGH-AH:"  work continues to confound, amaze, and make me feel a little just...different.  This position (Coordinator of Undergraduate Staff Development) is SO totally different from anything else I have ever done professionally that it was a bit jarring at first.  This position is FAR more administrative, and far more upper-echelon administrative than I knew.  I have two (2) grad students who assist me (one of 'em's a DOCTORAL student; eep!  Intimidation issues!), and I have two (2) administrative assistants in the office.  Oh, some people might argue that the physical layout of the office was a step down from my prior role; going from a newly constructed office building and into an office located in a residence hall (I JUST BLOODY WELL MOVED  OUT  OF ONE!  ARRGH!!!) might be seen as a lateral move at best by some, but y'know what?  It's gonna keep me in the thick of things (where I like to be, given how much I enjoy working with students), and it also makes me feel a little more grown-up due to the fact that I *have* to work all collaborative-like due to the committee-laden approach this place runs on.    However, at the ripe old age of 33, and due to the fact that I  *need*  to be getting on up that leadership ladder, this position will be great for me.  I smell nothing but potential (okay -- and a little fear on my part).     - FIGS, RAISINS, AND...:  this past weekend, I celebrated a milestone.  A six-month anniversary.  Of seeing someone.  "Dating," if you will.  Exclusively.  Consecutively.  Like, as in, "sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g."    Jaws off the floors, people.  I realize that this may come as a shock to more than a few of you, but...well, it's not exactly as if it was a SECRET.  I stayed silent to a few of you due to the multiple mitigating circumstances, 99% of which ain't there no more (don't ask, because I won't tell you anyway).  Also -- at the risk of sounding like an idiot -- another reason I stayed silent to a few of you was that I didn't want to JINX this.  This is my first REAL attempt at getting a life, moving on, and not letting my sordid and sad past kill me any longer.  Plus, some of you heathens might just not be able to cope with me having a -- dare I say it? -- GIRLFRIEND, due to the fact I have been Solo Sonny for as long as some of you have known me.    But, no more.  After six months, it's time to let you monkeys in on the deal.  So, I am dating.  Someone.  Someone wonderful who I have fallen madly and completely for.  Someone who can make me smile, someone who can make me laugh.    She's currenty enrolled in the FBI Witness Relocation program, so I can't mention Ka -- I mean, "her name" to you fully, you understand.    Ha.   Now begone.  I thirst for coffee.

        DAY TWO OF THE JOB AT UGA:   My cup of feeling overwhelmed doth runneth over.  This job is SO different from what I've spent the last ten (10) years doing, that...I dunno.  I feel like at any given moment, my new boss is going to walk in, state she didn't know what in the name of Fig Newtons they were thinkign when they hired me, and toss me out on my ear.  I know, I know...one I settle in, I'll be fine, but...urgh.  As soon as I get over the anxiety attack of it all, I will begin the detailing of the ******* trip here moving, Why BellSouth Is Run By The Antichrist, and how much a bloody parking decal here costs...

           Things you have to believe to be a Republican today:     &nbsp;  Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him and a bad guy when Bush needed a "we can't find Bin Laden" diversion.  &nbsp;  Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is Communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony.  &nbsp;  The United States should get out of the United Nations, and our highest national priority is enforcing U.N. resolutions against Iraq.  &nbsp;  A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multi-national corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind without regulation.  &nbsp;  Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of homosexuals and Hillary Clinton.  &nbsp;  The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in speeches while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay.  &nbsp;  If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex.  &nbsp;  A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our long-time allies, then demand their cooperation and money.  &nbsp;  Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy.&nbsp; Providing health care to all Americans is socialism.  &nbsp;  HMOs and insurance companies have the best interests of the public at heart.  &nbsp;  Global warming and tobacco's link to cancer are junk science, but creationism should be taught in schools.  &nbsp;  A president lying about an extramarital affair is an impeachable offense.&nbsp; A president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is solid defense policy.  &nbsp;  Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution, which include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet.  &nbsp;  The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades, but George Bush's driving record is none of our business.  &nbsp;  Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you're a conservative radio host. Then it's an illness and you need our prayers for your recovery.  &nbsp;  You support states' rights, which means Attorney General John Ashcroft can tell states what local voter initiatives they have the right to adopt.  &nbsp;  What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest, but what Bush did in the '80s is irrelevant.

        Thirteen days straight of working 14+ hours.    Every   day.        An average of four hours of sleep a night.      An average of one meal a day.      Three hundred and thirty-one staff members.      One night.  One closing ceremony.        ...and they gave me a standing ovation.        Damn.         Makes every headache, heartache, stress-related headache, and days when I sat in my office near tears worth it.  Beyond worth it.        This is why i do the job I do.         Now...all we have to do is survive opening weekend.      Check back next week -- the post-mortem blogging of UGA Residence Life Training  begins... soon...
