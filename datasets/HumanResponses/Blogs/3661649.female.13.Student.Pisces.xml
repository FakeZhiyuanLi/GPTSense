       Message:  100 Days...     Message:  a love story....     Message: Peter and Tina are sitting in the park doing nothing, but just gazing into the sky, while all their friends are having fun with their beloved half.      Tina  : I'm so bored. Just wish I have a boyfriend now to spend time with.    Peter: I guess we're the only leftovers. We're the only person who isn't with a date now. (both sigh n silence for a while)     Tina  : I think I have a good idea. Lets play a game..    Peter: Eh? What game?      Tina  : Eem.. It's quite simple. You be my boyfriend for 100 days and I'll be your girlfriend for 100 days. what do you think?      Peter  : Oookay.. Anyway I don't have any plan for the next few months.      Tina  : You sound like you aren't looking forward to it at all. Cheer up. Today will be our first day and our first date. Where should we go?      Peter  : What about a movie? I heard that there is a really great movie in theater now.      Tina  : Seems like I don't have any better idea than this. Lets move. (went to watch their movies and sent each other home)     Day 2 : Peter and Tina went to a concert together, and Peter bought Tina a keychain with a star.     Day 3 : They went shopping together for a friend's birthday present. Share an ice-cream together and hugged each other for the first time.     Day 7 : Peter drove Tina up onto a mountain and they watch the sunset together. When the night came and the moon glowed, they said sat on the grass gazing at the stars together. A meteor passed by. Tina mumbled somethin.     Day 25 : Spend time at a themepark and got onto rollercoasters, and ate hotdogs and cotton candy. Peter and Tina got in the haunted house and Tina grabbed someone's hand instead of Peter's hand by accident. They laughed together for a while.     Day 67 : They drove pass a circus and decided to get in to watch the show. The midget asked Tina to play a part as his assistant in the magic show. Went around to see other entertainments around after the show. Came to a fortune teller and she just said "Treasure every moment from now on" and a tear rolled down the fortune teller's cheek.     Day 84 : Tina suggested that they go to the beach. The beach wasn't so crowded that day. They have their first kiss with each other just as the sun is setting.     Day 99 : They decided to have a simple day and is deciding to have a walk around the city. They sits down onto a bench.     1:23 pm, Tina  : I'm thirsty. Lets rest for a while first.      Peter  : Wait here while I go buy some drinks. What would you like?      Tina  : Eem...Apple juice will be just fine.     1:43 pm  Tina waiting for about 20 minutes and Peter havent return. Then someone walked up to her.      Stranger  : Is your name Tina?      Tina  : Yes, and may I help you?      Stranger  : Just now down there on the street a drunk driver has crashed into a guy. I think its your friend.    Tina ran over to the spot with the stranger and sees Peter lying on the floor with blood over his face and her apple juice still in his hands. The ambulance came and she went to the hospital with Peter. Tina sat outside the emergency room for five and a half hours.    The doctor came out, and he sigh. 11:51 pm      Doctor  : I'm sorry, but we did the best we could. He is still breathing now but God would take him away from us very soon. We found this letter inside his pocket.    The doctor hands over the letter to Tina and she goes into the room to see Peter. He look weak but peaceful. Tina read the letter and then she burst into tears. Here is what the letter said.     Tina, our 100 days is almost over. I had fun with you during all these days. Although you may be greedy sometimes and less thoughtful, but these all brought happiness into my life. I have realize that you are a really cute girl and blamed myself for never taken the time to knowing that. I have nothing much to ask for, but I just wish that we can extend the day. I want to be your boyfriend forever and wish that you can be beside me all the time. Tina, I love you.      11:58    Tina   : (sobbing) Peter. Did you know what was the wish I made on the night there was a meteor. I asked God to let us last forever. We were suppose to last 100 days so Peter! You can't leave me! I LOVE YOU, but can you come back to me now? I love you Peter. I LOVE YOU.    As the clock struck twelve, Peter's heart stopped beating. It was 100 days.     *NOTE*  Tell the guy or girl that you love them before its too late. You never know whats going to happen tomorrow. You never know who will be leaving you and never return.

        From the very beginning, the girl's family objected strongly on her dating this guy, saying that it has got to do with family background, & that the girl will have to suffer for the rest of her life if she were to be with him.  Due to family pressure, the couple quarrelled very often. Though the girl loved the guy deeply, she always asked him: "How deep is your love for me?" As the guy is not good with his words, this often caused the girl to be very upset. With that &amp; the family's pressure, the gal often vent her anger on him. As for him,.. he only endured it in silence.  After a couple of years, the guy finally graduated & decided to further his studies overseas. Before leaving, he proposed to the gal: "I'm not very good with words. But all I know is that I love you. If you allow me, I will take care of you for the rest of my life. As for your family, I'll try my best to talk them round. Will you marry me?"  The girl agreed, &amp; with the guy's determination, the family finally gave in & agreed to let them get married. So before he left, they got engaged. The gal went out to the working society, whereas the guy was overseas, continuing his studies. They sent their love through emails &amp; phone calls. Though it was hard, but both never thought of giving up.  One day, while the gal was on her way to work, she was knocked down by a car that lost control. When she woke up, she saw her parents beside her bed. She realized that she was badly injured. Seeing her mum crying, she wanted to comfort her. But she realized that all that could come out of her mouth was just a sigh. she had lost her voice....  The doctors sayed that the impact on her brain has caused her to lose her voice. Listening to her parents' comfort, but with nothing coming out from her, she broke down. During the stay in the hospital, besides silence cry,.. it's still just silence cry that accompanied her. Upon reaching home, everything seems to be the same. Except for the ringing tone of the phone. Which pierced into her heart everytime it rang. She does not wish to let the guy know & not wanting to be a burden to him, she wrote a letter to him saying that she does not wish to wait any longer.  With that, she sent the ring back to him. In return, the guy sent millions &amp; millions of reply, countless of phonecalls,.. all the gal could do, besides crying, is still cry.... The parents decided to move away, hoping that she could eventually forget everything & be happy. With a new environment, the gal learn sign language &amp; started a new life. Telling herself everyday that she must forget the guy. One day, her friend came & told her that he's back. She asked her friend not to let him know what happened to her. Since then, there wasn't anymore news of him.  A year has passed &amp; her friend came with an envelope, containing a invitation card for the guy's wedding. the gal was shattered. When she open the letter, she saw her name in it instead. When she was about to ask her friend what's going on, she saw the guy standing in front of her.  He used sign language to tell her "I've spent a year to learn sign language. Just to let you know that I've not forgotten our promise. Let me have the chance to be your voice. I Love You." With that, he slipped the ring back into her finger. The gal finally smiled.  Treat every relationship as if it's the last one, then you'll know how to Give. Treat every moment as is it's the last day, then you'll know how to treasure. Treasure what you have right now, or else you will regret one day....
