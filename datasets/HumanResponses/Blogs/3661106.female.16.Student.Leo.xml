      Try not to cry Don't let the pain show When your fears hurt the most Just let them go No regrets You told me with a smile But I didn't listen I still cry  You live a life Doubtless and free of pain and worry 'free of misery' I wish I could live by your wise creed but I can't block emotion It won't let go of me  I look up to your wisdom I admire your strength But I can't follow your footsteps For I am still week A fledgling of truth Yet living in lies this is the lifestyle you so despise  This is written for my cousin Harrison, who though he is 6 months younger than me, has always been a sort of mentor.  He's there for me in tough times and gives me advice on what I need advice on the most, life.

      Well, this isn't exactly poetry, but I'm just not feeling very inspired at the moment.  Of course, that could be due to the fact that it is 2:33 AM where I am currently located.  Anything I try to type that isn't planned will most likely not be coherent.  I'm very tired, but I don't really feel like sleeping.  Strange.  I'll probably sleep in tomorrow until 12 and then be a pain in the ass all day.  Such is life.  Anyways, I'm going to attempt sleep.  I'll put up a poem tomorrow or something.

       The Fall of the Pure  A tear falls from my eye Into the sea Where has it gone? This thing called humanity My tear is lost In the great abiss of purity where dwells a style so sweet and free The swells of sweetest revelry  where friends are not lost and love doesn't end where the signs of the time are not peoples' sins where hatred and darkness are not known where the beautiful are not alone  it lightens up each soul with truth and all are hearkened to the light of youth such in these souls  is purity a neverending  and lovely chastity  but while man reigns so does hate it floods our souls and swells over the gates the purity wanes the truth wavers the hate holds fast and we await a saviour  When will he come to take away our doubt For all this pain Can't be what existance is about What light he giveth me I pass to you And hope that your soul Will to hope hold true
