						   The human mind is strange...When there's no work to do, people crib and complain that theydo not have any work but when there's work to be done, the same people crib that there's too much to do. Strange!!

						   This is my first blog...am not sure what to write...will keep putting up what ever crosses my mind every now and then.  Sure the Blog page name's corny! Couldn't think of anything else...

						   Am back after a loooooong time!!  Saw  Lord of the Rings-Return of the King  last week...got totally bowled over by the graphics...Amazing stuff! The only thing that left a bad taste was the ending...the film's maker(s) haven't done much justice by cutting out details!  Have been so fascinated by LOTR that I have started learning  Quenya , the Elvish Language...let's see how long my enthusiasm lasts!

						   Buddha says:  Ambition is like love - impatient about delays and rivals.   I have been known to be impatient since childhood....so what is that supposed to mean??

						   Am not sure what to put down...just felt the urge to put something on this poor long-neglected blog.  Frankly, I am not too good with words. It seems so much easier to talk and express yourself...but the downside is that you do not have the permanence of words.  Say something today and you forget it tomorrow... there  are  times when you would rather forget what you said ... but I digress...  Well, you write down something today ; probably when you read it after some time, it would bring back memories of things that happened when you wrote that...  I ought to blog more but most times I have no patience to clear things up and put down my thoughts as fluently as other bloggers do...  As they say,  Practice makes perfect ...people, expect better blogs from me in the future

						   Another one of my favorites by Robert Frost...   Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,   And sorry I could not travel both   And be one traveler, long I stood   And looked down one as far as I could   To where it bent in the undergrowth;   Then took the other, as just as fair,   And having perhaps the better claim,   Because it was grassy and wanted wear;   Though as for that the passing there   Had worn them really about the same,   And both that morning equally layIn leaves no step had trodden black.   Oh, I kept the first for another day!   Yet knowing how way leads on to way,   I doubted if I should ever come back.I   &nbsp;shall be telling this with a sigh   Somewhere ages and ages hence:   Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-   I took the one less traveled by,   And that has made all the difference.     Beautiful...just love this one

						    I watched the cricket match between India and Sri Lanka yesterday...it was a pretty tense match and India managed to scrape through and will go on to the Asia Cup finals...   Trust India to take the things to the edge...Of late, lots of people have been praising our Indian cricket team as being No. 2 in the world but most of the games they have won have been pretty close like yesterday's match!!   I am yet to see a convincing win by them to justify the No. 2 tag!! Most of the times, they just manage to scrape through by the skin of their teeth...

						    Coming to office today has been a total waste of time... No link...so no work...have been twiddling my thumbs since morning    &nbsp;  The network connectivity&nbsp;also is pathetic&nbsp;here...having a tough time downloading anything!! Even the simplest of web pages takes 10-15 minutes to download!    I'm  BORED  stiff!!

						    Some say the world will end in fire, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Some say in ice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    From what I've tasted of desire &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I hold with those who favor fire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    But if it had to perish twice, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I think I know enough of hate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    To know that for destruction ice &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Is also great &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And would suffice.

						   It's been 3 days since I have started commuting to Electronics City. I keep hearing horror stories from people about the traffic jams that happen on the way to EC.   Well, I have seen that the problem is more to do with people rather than the infrastructure. The road is good...there is some traffic management ( it could do with some improvement of course )...but the main problem is with the drivers themselves.  I am yet to see any sane driving on that road so far...starting from cyclists to truck drivers, everybody seems to believe that nothing can happen to them... One finds slow moving trucks which should actually be on the left side of the road, driving right in the middle...cyclists doing their own version of the Superbiker...pedestrians playing a game of "who can jay-walk across the road slowest" or "who can scare the driver best" and mad bikers galore...cars zipping around like crazy dodgems   If only people would follow the traffic rules as they were meant to be followed...

						    I adapt, therefore I survive;   I survive, therefore I exist;   I exist, therefore I think;   I think, therefore I suffer;   I suffer, therefore I adapt...    &nbsp; And the cycle continues....it's vicious really!

						    Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the wise.  Seek what they sought   Matsuo Basho     Makes some sense!! Have been in a search mode for a long time now...*ahem*, am searching for a new job but not that search mode...I digress.  I haven't been able to define yet what it is that I am searching for but there's always that feeling of restlessness....I fidget...I cannot stay at one place for more than a short period of time...I have changed jobs...I keep changing places...I keep travelling  There's a niggling feeling that I need to find  something ! Maybe I will find it, whatever it is, someday!

						   There's nothing more soothing than driving down the highway in the night...add some soft music to that and with the cool wind caressing your face...Ah! It's almost heaven!!  I guess it's the vastness of the things we have in Nature that cause such wonder...especially the sky. I never get tired of gazing at it.  At times, I wish I could just chuck whatever I am doing and just go travelling...seeing new places, discovering things.  I think it is the idea of travel and discovery that draws me to the kind of books I read, the movies I watch...

						   I went for an interview a couple of days ago and well, I think I did OK. But I just havent been able to clue what the interviewers were thinking!! They kept smiling all the time...would have been easier if they kept a poker face...would have been able to notice any stray expressions on their face!!But smiling people??!! how do you make anything out of that?  Maybe they were thinking :  "Oh boy! Is this guy giving me great answers? I am so impressed I cant help smiling"   or maybe:  "Man! Such hilarious answers...I can barely control myself!! Think I'll just smile to put him off!!"   well,  urlLink Mangs  thinks it could be like this:  "This guy is soooo cute...I just have to keep smiling at him!!"  Wishful thinking...dont think that's the case though anyway   Anyway, got my fingers crossed...waiting to see what happens

						   Today I spent half an hour waiting for a traffic jam to get cleared en route to office...It was a pretty long queue with the line of vehicles stretching nearly a kilometre.. It was then that I realized: it is only in traffic jams that I get to stop  and think about things in general!  Most of the time we spend is in a race to get ahead of things... In school and college, it's a headlong rush to get good grades...After college, it's a race to get a job...once you get a job, you start chasing better jobs...bigger money...a better life...  But what really defines a better life? When do we ever stop to catch our breath and enjoy what we have? It's a restless life with our noses to a ceaseless grindstone... Do we really understand the purpose of all that we do? Why we go through this entire cycle of life?  I guess that's a question that's been plaguing people for aeons... But then if we really found an answer, wouldn't all the fun go away? Isnt it the quest that drives us?  Maybe one will find something close to an answer some day...

						   Overheard a colleague ordering dinner at office:   "Hello, Can you take my order, please?"    "OK, I'll have a half-meal, a gobi-manchurian and My name is Gireesh."    "No, No, I dont want Ghee rice!...my name is Gireesh"    "Arre yaar, I want just a half-meal and a gobi manchurian!!...I dont want Ghee Rice!!! My NAME  is Gireesh"    "Hello, Listen to me...I want the meal and Gobi and my phone extn is 3185. Please send it soon"    "Gireesh" to "Ghee Rice": Hohahohhe what a transformation  ( BTW, he spells his name with ee not an i )   Finally, the numbers did the trick!

						   Life seems so funny...   I wanted some things desperately at one time and try as I might, I couldn't even get close to those things!!      Now when I have let them go and have focussed on something else, those opportunities come back falling over themselves!!   I guess that's what is called irony!!
