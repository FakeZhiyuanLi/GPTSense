      Another weekend went by too fast. My last weekend in the city for the next few weeks. On Friday I'm going down to the coast of Washington for a few days with Sean's family. Then it's off to Nova Scotia for a couple relaxing weeks at home. I'm looking forward to it, although I know I have so much work to do that I won't be doing, and that's stressing me out a little. Oh well. Summer is the time for vacations, right?  The past weekend was nice, except for a heat rash I developed while drinking outside on a patio Friday night. That's how hot it was! Unbelievable for Vancouver... Spending most of Saturday in the mall didn't help my situation any.&nbsp; Although the beach that evening was nice. And then Spiderman 2, which was very good. The X-alumni barbecue was on Sunday. Fun, as always. Then I watched Sean and his friends play soccer. Then we ordered pizza. And that was it.   I feel like none of my weekends this summer have been that exciting, although I'm rarely home for more than a few hours any weekend (not including time spent in bed). It's keeping me busy enough.

      I'm not as good at posting here as I was hoping to be. Not sure why I was expecting much...I barely ever write in my journal anymore. Although I'm more free to now than ever, with no fear of any siblings reading it! After 24 years of living with at least one of my brothers or sister, it's so nice to be a bit more independent! And now I've been living with Sean for almost a year!  Of course, I miss living with Steph. After all, we had never lived apart until this past year. I really miss always knowing what she's up to. I can't keep track of her very well anymore. And I think she's using her independence to spend way too much time with her slimy ex-boyfriend. Oh well. Not really much I can do about that. She has to see that he's slimy and that she can do much better for herself. All I can do is lead some good prospects her way...&nbsp; Which I'm working on...

      A wonderful weekend.  A late birthday party Friday night, complete with a banner, balloons, pizza, cake, and presents! And bowling! No strikes or spares for me, but that's ok...my boyfriend was the star!  Shopping in Bellingham on Saturday. Not overly successful for me, but Steph did well. And that was the important part. And I found the cutest bracelet!  Finally saw  Troy  Saturday night with Sean It was very good. Although a couple of cheesey moments made me laugh out loud at perhaps inappropriate moments. Good thing I'm a quiet laugher.  Beach on Sunday with Steph. Then watched Sean play soccer. Most important accomplishment from yesterday: Avoiding sunburn!

      It's unbelievable how fast time can past. I know I sound like I'm old, but it's crazy some times.  Like, what was I doing 3 years ago today? I was on the other side of the country. My brother's wedding had been the day before, so I was hungover. I remember we went to a party after the reception, so we got home late. Then I had to take all the bobby pins out of my hair and get out of my bridesmaid dress. And the crinoline was really loud and crinkly and I felt bad because I'm sure we woke&nbsp;up everyone in the house when we came home.  And although we were hungover, we couldn't sleep in the next day because we had to&nbsp;go to church, of course. And then there was the gift opening in the afternoon. And I found out that I was the only member of my immediate family (including my father  and  little brother) who didn't get hit on at the wedding (it didn't really matter because I was planning to move soon, but still!). And then family was going home. And my sister and I stayed in PEI for a little while longer.  And now I'm in Vancouver. Waiting for my own engagement ring. And the happy couple who has now been married for over 3 years is expecting a baby any day now. Crazy. It all seems like yesterday.  And the worst part is I've never worn the dress since, although I really love it.

      Just got back from dinner with Sean's parents. I don't know why but it's always so awkward, even after knowing them all for 3 years. I always feel like I'm taking too much food or too little or eating too fast or too slow. But Sean never notices or seems to care when I ask him about it later. I'm probably just paranoid. And maybe everyone feels like that sometimes. Hopefully I'll get over it eventually.

      Why is it that no matter how much sleep I get, it never seems to be enough? When I was in undergrad, I functioned just fine on 6 hours or so a night. Pulled in pretty good marks, too. Now, if I get less than 9, I'm sleepy for the rest of the day. And if I get more than 9.5 hours, I'm sleepy for the rest of the day. It's tough to hit that sweet spot. Especially when my apartment is so hot. And Sean's back is so sore that he's been tossing and turning all night. Which, of course, makes me toss and turn.  Oh well. Enough complaining. Back to work.

      I'm not even sure why I decided I needed a blog...maybe because I spend so much time reading other people's online journals. People I don't even know. Some people that I know of....  The weird thing is, most of them are much younger than me. So why am I doing this?   I guess I need a new outlet for my thoughts. Maybe I'll be more likely to type here since I spend so much time on the computer. Procrastinating. Don't I have a paper I should be working on?
