        Romans 12    Living Sacrifices    1Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God's mercy, to  offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God--this is your spiritual[1] act of worship.  2Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is--his good, pleasing and perfect will.  3For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you.  4Just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, 5so in Christ we who are many form one body, and each member belongs to all the others . 6We have different gifts, according to the grace given us. If a man's gift is prophesying, let him use it in proportion to his[2] faith. 7If it is serving, let him serve; if it is teaching, let him teach; 8if it is encouraging, let him encourage; if it is contributing to the needs of others, let him give generously; if it is leadership, let him govern diligently; if it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully.   Love   9Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. 10Be devoted to one another in brotherly love. Honor one another above yourselves. 11Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. 12Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer.    Footnotes  12:1 Or reasonable 12:6 Or in agreement with the    "...offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God--this is your spiritual[1] act of worship.  (v1)  ...WHAM. OUCH. Owww....  That's pretty much how i felt when i read this verse. Serious! Come on, agree with me here, this verse hits you right where it hurts. Offer your bodies as living sacrifices?? Frankly, if i offered myself right now to God, it would be far from pleasing. For different people 'dirtying' yourself might be different, ranging from lying,to stealing, to reading bad books. For me, i guess i feel it the most when i do..physical contact. You know what i mean, i don't need to go into detail here. It's gotten so that i feel unclean whenever i do something bad like that. And you know what?  It spoils worship.  It does!  'Christians don't tell lies, they sing lies'  Ever heard that one? Ouch.  (v4-6) I like this part a lot. It says that each one of us is given a gift, some function that contributes to the whole working. Cool,eh? Go on, read further. Did you catch that? "If it is serving, let him serve.." Hey, being able to serve is a gift! How about encouraging, contributing to the needs of others, giving, and showing mercy? No, gifts aren't just those  "wahliau oh my goodness so cun!"  kind of gifts, the ones that everyone always notices. You know, the prominent ones like the gift of healing, teaching, preaching, etc etc...these are ones that people most often appreciate. Here God points out that He has put special gifts in  each one of us. . If you can encourage, hey! you've got a gift. If you can give, hey, you've got a gift! Don't you ever tell  God, "No, God, i'm not special, don't use me, use someone else." Instead say, " Here I am,Lord, use me." You wait and see what miracles God will perform through you.  Our God is a BIG God.   9Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good  I'll leave you to draw your own wisdom from that.  Signing off, Jenna

        2 Chronicles 36   Zedekiah King of Judah  11 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. 12 He did evil in the eyes of the LORD his God and did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke the word of the LORD . 13 He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him take an oath in God's name. He became stiff-necked and hardened his heart and would not turn to the LORD , the God of Israel. 14 Furthermore, all the leaders of the priests and the people became more and more unfaithful, following all the detestable practices of the nations and defiling the temple of the LORD , which he had consecrated in Jerusalem.   The Fall of Jerusalem  15 The LORD , the God of their fathers, sent word to them through his messengers again and again, because he had pity on his people and on his dwelling place. 16 But they mocked God's messengers, despised his words and scoffed at his prophets until the wrath of the LORD was aroused against his people and there was no remedy. 17 He brought up against them the king of the Babylonians, who killed their young men with the sword in the sanctuary, and spared neither young man nor young woman, old man or aged. God handed all of them over to Nebuchadnezzar.    Those of you in our national schools should be familiar with demerit points awarded for breaking school rules. The points depend on the crime (disrupting a class might be five points, while fighting might be thirty points). The points are awarded by the discipline teachers and recorded. When your accumulated points reach a certain limit, you can get suspended from school. And when it reaches a higher limit, you get expelled.  Our sins are like that. Not that God keeps track with points like that, but our sins build up. There are many things in our life (bad ones) that don't just happen spontaneously.   It's unlikely you'll get beat up for talking trash on one occasion. But if you've already got a reputation as a trash-talking person, chances are some people will tolerate it less. If you're a jerk, your attitude might build up and eventually cause another jerk to blow up at you. Many things happen based on our past decisions.  In the passage, God didn't allow the sinning that went on. In verse 16, He finally delivered what was coming to His people. God didn't allow His people to continue sinning, though He was patient with them. His patience has a limit.  We all have back-logged sins in our lives. These are putting us in danger of being disciplined by God. If we don't correct these problems by ourselves, we can rest assured God will.  Your friend, Kevin

        Psalm 40   For the director of music. Of David. A psalm.   1 I waited patiently for the LORD ;  he turned to me and heard my cry.  2 He lifted me out of the slimy pit,  out of the mud and mire;  he set my feet on a rock  and gave me a firm place to stand.  3 He put a new song in my mouth,  a hymn of praise to our God.  Many will see and fear  and put their trust in the LORD .   Whenever I do something I know is not pleasing to God, I feel slimy all over, dirty, unclean.Even after I ask for forgiveness, the dirty feeling  doesn't go away.  There are plenty of times when I don't  live  at all.  When King David talks about a slimy pit, it sort of got me thinking about how i often walk and fall into that pit on purpose. How I wave away the verses the Holy Spirit gives me to resist temptation, how i act like i  like  being in that pit. It's like being drunk, or on drugs, when your mind tells you its bad for you but your body just wants to enjoy it. In mud you're not going anywhere. You're just going to slip and fall, and get dirty, and sick, and die.  You just die.   The Lord can lift you up, and put you on solid rock.  Maybe it's worth giving up the cool, pleasant sensation of the mud,  the thrill it gives you, for the hard, cold rock, which will eventually lead you to a safe refuge.   Our Father has His hand out to us, to pull us out of the pit.  Will we take it?  Because Psalm 40 says that what's waiting for us up there, on solid ground, is so good we will have a new song in our hearts, to worship Him, love Him, and tell others about Him.  God can turn our bad circumstances into something worthwhile. Like when we're in trouble, and we cry out to Him for help, and He helps us...and someone else gets touched by it too. That'd be nice, wouldn't it?  Signing off, Jenna

       The Sign of Jonah   29As the crowds increased, Jesus said, "This is a wicked generation. It asks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah. 30For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation. 31The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now one[1] greater than Solomon is here. 32The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here.   Footnotes  11:31 Or something; also in verse 32   Jonah was a prophet who experienced some pretty messed up situations. He was thrown into a stormy sea and swallowed by a fish (which eventually spat him out). He went through this because he didn't obey God when he was told to go preach to the Ninevites. Eventually, he did go preach to the Ninevites, and they believed he was God-sent and they repented.  Jesus told this against people who asked for signs. Some people say "I'll believe in Jesus if he appears to me here and now", but Jesus referred to them as a wicked generation.   Faith is esentially believing in something, and in this case in something we can't see. Nowadays, Jesus isn't physically manifested to us, so we rely on faith to know he exists. But that's not all we have. We know for a fact that Jesus did so many wonderful things while he was on earth. He healed the sick, raised the dead, and cast out demons. If these aren't signs to you, you wouldn't believe in a thunderstorm if lightning struck you.  People ask for miraculous signs of Jesus' existence. Today, what we have is the gospel to tell us of all the miraculous things he did do. The gospel is our proof of miracles.  Your friend, Kevin

        Isaiah 48   17 This is what the LORD says-  your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:    "I am the LORD your God,  who teaches you what is best for you,  who directs you in the way you should go.    18 If only you had paid attention to my commands,  your peace would have been like a river,  your righteousness like the waves of the sea.  19 Your descendants would have been like the sand,  your children like its numberless grains;  their name would never be cut off  nor destroyed from before me."   20 Leave Babylon,  flee from the Babylonians!  Announce this with shouts of joy  and proclaim it.  Send it out to the ends of the earth;  say, "The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob."    21 They did not thirst when he led them through the deserts;  he made water flow for them from the rock;  he split the rock  and water gushed out.     22 "There is no peace," says the LORD , "for the wicked."    Our God is big .He created everything in this universe, the stars and the heavens, the earth and all living things. Man has been asking questions like "Where did the earth come from?" and "What is the key to happiness?" You know we're so blessed? We don't  need  ask these questions. We have the answers.   Obey God, and you will enjoy...  1)Peace like a river (v18) Have you ever been in the worst of bad moods? Down in the absolute pits, buried under a pile of work, caught up in a fight with one of your friends even thought you're right? You know that feeling when you can't take it any more and you feel like yelling and giving up? God can take it away. Take it from me, if you go to a quiet place, close your eyes, and pray, you will have peace like a river, and these are the best times because you can feel God's love acutely. It's a beautiful feeling.   2)No regrets (v17) No really, no regrets! God made the entire universe in 7 days without messing up the smallest atom, why should the way He gives you be wrong? So things don't seem to be going right even though you did the right thing.God sees the whole picture, somewhere along the line, you're  going to look back at that decision and praise Him.   3)Water in the middle of the desert (v21) Our Father will take care of us, you know? Did you know that He put angels in charge of you? You have a guardian angel with you right now. We don't need to be afraid of anything :- evil spirits, diseases, enemies. We have the King of Kings on our side.   And so...   Our Father loves us and He  cares  He will protect you, and you don't ever need to fear anything ever again.  Signing off, Jenna

        Hebrews 12   God Disciplines His Sons   1Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us. 2Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. 3Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.  4In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. 5And you have forgotten that word of encouragement that addresses you as sons:     "My son, do not make light of the Lord's discipline,         and do not lose heart when he rebukes you,      6because the Lord disciplines those he loves,         and he punishes everyone he accepts as a son." 7Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as sons. For what son is not disciplined by his father? 8If you are not disciplined (and everyone undergoes discipline), then you are illegitimate children and not true sons. 9Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of our spirits and live! 10Our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, that we may share in his holiness. 11No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.   I used to have this history teacher when I was fourteen who asked history questions and caned those who couldn't answer correctly. You wouldn't believe how much my friends and I hated him. We wrote insulting poems and songs about him (I still see his name plastered all over the toilets). It's amazing how creative fourteen year olds high on teenage angst can be.  On the days we knew would be a question-answer-caning session, we were forced to study doubly hard (or in my case, actually study). Not much help, as he ensured most of his questions referred to the most obscure of obscure footnotes. I lost count of the times I got caned by around May. I endured pain, torment, and suffering brought on by this tyrannical history teacher for a whole year, never actually believing I'd make any progress.  My final exam marks were pretty brilliant. Really brilliant! The kind of brilliance parents reward you for. I was in denial for a while, as my pride refused to admit the reason for this amazing turnaround (my marks before that were mediocore at best). Deep down, I knew the reason. Who wouldn't be motivated by the prspect of being caned for not achieving certain marks?   Today, I greatly respect that teacher, and because of that we have as good a teacher-student relationship as any someone like him's likely to have. Not everyone in my class that year appreciates him, seeing what he did as disciplining rather than torture. Truth is, we needed that kind of discipline to succeed. At least I needed it.  Who enjoys disciplining? Who can see it's what makes us grow stronger? Verse 11 says "No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it". Discipline brings good, but not at the time we receive it. I felt no goodness at the moment the cane struck my hand for the very first time (something about the tin mining in Selangor). I felt good recieving my final exam marks. I felt good when I realised that the discipline was what enabled me to do what I did.  God disciplines us everyday. It might not be as direct as being caned or struck by lightning, but the adversities we face everyday are God's ways of moulding us to be more like Jesus. What do we do? Verses 5-7 remind us to remain strong in knowing that we're disciplined because we're loved, because we're His sons. If we surrender rather than resist being disciplined, we can see that God wants us to grow spiritually strong.  There's a parallel between my teacher's disciplining and God's tough love. Of course, I'm in no way supporting what my teacher did, using the cane in the classroom. That's up to your own interpretation, whether you're able to accept that kind of disciplining in order to grow stronger. I'm happy God loves me enough to discipline me, moulding me into a better person. I still see that teacher from time to time. I can't remember a single nasty thing that we wrote about him.

      The Shepherd and His Flock    1"I tell you the truth, the man who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber. 2The man who enters by the gate is the shepherd of his sheep. 3The watchman opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. 4When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice. 5But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger's voice." 6Jesus used this figure of speech, but they did not understand what he was telling them.  7Therefore Jesus said again, "I tell you the truth, I am the gate for the sheep. 8All who ever came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. 9I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved.[1] He will come in and go out, and find pasture. 10The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy;  I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.    Before I started writing for Word Power, I didn't really think about what Jesus really meant. It was easier to just breeze through passages like this one, and miss out on the deeper meanings. Take this one, for example. Once I really started thinking about it, it was really hard to get the meaning behind each 'figure of speech'. Here's what I came up with:   1.The thief/robber   "...the man who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber."  (v1) I thought long and hard about this one. I'm thinking that the thief could be men who come and preach a different 'gospel', one that has no Jesus in it. Because, you see, the thief does not enter throught the gate (Jesus). Men like these come to steal the flock from the shepard (Jesus), and they do it by  telling people they don't need Him to be saved.   2.The sheep   "...He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out"  This was another poser for me too, because I originally thought that the sheep here referred to everyone. Then,as I read on, I was confused, because it said that the sheep "follow him because they know his voice". 'But not everyone listens to Him, some listen to the thieves too,' i thought. I came to the  conclusion that there are two groups of sheep in the pen, black sheep and white sheep. When the shephard calls, he calls his own sheep, the white, and they follow Him because they know His voice. Here it shows how important it is to know Jesus, and not just believe in Him, because if we don't know Him and His Word, some stranger could call us and we would follow. The black sheep get stolen by the thieves and the robbers, and you know what happens to them. They become food.   3. The gate.    "...Jesus said again, "I tell you the truth, I am the gate for the sheep"(v7)  I am really thankful that John recorded this part of the story. If he didn't, i would never have connected the gate with Jesus.     And so...  I saved the best for last.   10The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy;  I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.   Jesus came not only so we could live, but so that we can live life to the fullest. And when you stop to think about it, it has become (or  can  become) real to us. We have the power over bondages, peace that transcends all understanding (Phil 4:6-9), a Father's love (John 3:16), everything! And the promise of eternal life.   When you stop to think, you will realise that we are free from so many things, and blessed way beyond what we deserve.  Don't listen to people who tell you that Jesus isn't the Way, the Truth and the Life. Listen to the Shephard, and He will make your paths straight.  Signing off, Jenna

        Mark 3   The Appointing of the Twelve Apostles   13Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him. 14He appointed twelve--designating them apostles[1] --that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach 15and to have authority to drive out demons. 16These are the twelve he appointed: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter); 17James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder); 18Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot 19and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.   Footnotes  3:14 Some manuscripts do not have designating them apostles.    Ever believed in something that you were willing to sacrifice so much for? I've known people willing to give up so much to follow a cause. Some sacrifice so much in service to the church, others for meaningless things. Like those terrorists who claim to die for God. Okay, not really.   The 12 apostles were called by Jesus into a life of following him. Yeah, it sounded appealing. Imagine being recruited by Kris Roe of the Ataris to join his new band (not all of you will know what I'm talking about, I suppose).   It was something great, exciting, and above all; it was something worth it. I mean, the Son of God calls on you, why would you turn it down? In verse 15 it says they were given authority to drive out demons! That's something, to be given power over spirits for following Jesus.  I don't know if you'd call it a catch, but the road of following Jesus was never going to be easy. Imagine going on a world tour with a band. You'd have to deal with missing your loved ones, temptaion, and all sorts of problems from the rock and roll world.  The apostles were constantly facing persecution. They were hated by the people who hated Jesus. They left behind everything and followed him, even though they realised there were dangers they would face. They might not have known exactly what dangers they would face, but they followed Jesus and trusted in him. Later on, some were killed in the name of Jesus.  In one way or another, Jesus calls all of us the same way he called the 12 apostles. In some way, we're called to serve him, to love him, to obey him, and to tell people about him. The road may not be smooth following him (being laughed at, ridiculed, shunned...) but Jesus wants us to be faithful and follow him anyway.  Your friend, Kevin

       Submit Yourselves to God   1What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don't they come from your desires that battle within you? 2You want something but don't get it. You kill and covet, but you cannot have what you want. You quarrel and fight. You do not have, because you do not ask God. 3When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.  4You adulterous people,  don't you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God?  Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God. 5Or do you think Scripture says without reason that the spirit he caused to live in us envies intensely?[1] 6But he gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says:        "God opposes the proud         but gives grace to the humble."[2]  7 Submit yourselves, then, to God.Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 8Come near to God and he will come near to you.  Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. 9Grieve, mourn and wail. Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom. 10Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.    Footnotes  4:5 Or that God jealously longs for the spirit that he made to live in us; or that the Spirit he caused to live in us longs jealously     When I was little,  in Children's Church, my teachers used to have Object Lessons, where they would show me a paper heart which was clean and pink on one side, and black on the other. There was also this cup filled with water, into which they put a few drops of ink (sin). The whole cup would turn black.  My heart is the black one, my cup is full of dirty water. You open the door to your heart to let Jesus in, right? He lives in me. How can He live in such a dirty place?  "Wash your hands, you sinners...(vs8)".  Wash my hands? I've washed my hands so many,many,many times before, and still feel unclean.   "don't you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God?" (vs4)  Friendship to the world? You know what that is? It's using bad words with the rest of the world, doing drugs with the rest of the world, singing along to explicit lyrics with the rest of the world. A speaker once put it this way :  It's like holding on to one pole and trying to touch another pole 20m away. You just can't do it. You have to let go of one to reach the other.   Don't I feel like hyprocrite, typing this out and not living it? It's even worse for me because I know the weapons, I  know  how to resist the devil. It's right here, in a verse I've read so many times before! "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you".!! I  know  what the Bible says about certain things I do, I   how to counter it.  But I don't.  I don't.  I'm getting there. I will get there. It's hard, but  Jesus is worth it.    "Come near to God and he will come near to you." (James 4:8)  Isn't that beautiful? It's like a promise, one of the best in the Bible. Do you believe it?  Signing off, Jenna

        Psalm 3   A psalm of David. When he fled from his son Absalom.   1 O LORD , how many are my foes!  How many rise up against me!  2 Many are saying of me,  "God will not deliver him."  Selah [1]   3 But you are a shield around me, O LORD ;  you bestow glory on me and lift [2] up my head.  4 To the LORD I cry aloud,  and he answers me from his holy hill.  Selah   5 I lie down and sleep;  I wake again, because the LORD sustains me.  6 I will not fear the tens of thousands  drawn up against me on every side.   7 Arise, O LORD !  Deliver me, O my God!  Strike all my enemies on the jaw;  break the teeth of the wicked.   8 From the LORD comes deliverance.  May your blessing be on your people.  Selah   Footnotes  3:2 A word of uncertain meaning, occurring frequently in the Psalms; possibly a musical term  3:3 Or LORD , / my Glorious One, who lifts   If there's one thing that I've learned, my enemies are just as close to me as my friends. I don't know of anyone who goes out of the way to make enemies, but in this mad world, there's no denying our enemies exist. Their attacks range from spreading stories about you to actually physically hurting you.  A few years back, I went through a dark time when someone spread rumours about me (I still don't know why, to this day). Chaos ensued, with threats and ill-will aimed at me for the good part of a year. That time was filled with sleepless nights and I was constantly depressed and on edge, for I felt I had enemies on all sides just waiting to get me.  In Psalm 3, David went through something similiar (though I doubt it was something as trivial as teenage rumours). David got out of it okay, because of God. It's asking alot for man to cope with the feeling of being surrounded by enemies. David brought his fears to God, and He eased them (how can you not calm down knowing you have God on your side?). David refused to listen to people who said God wasn't with him (verse 2), but instead trusted that God was his protector.  I didn't exactly write a psalm to God the way David did during dark times. I was scared senseless some days, and wide awake most nights. A big thanks goes to out to God, for "striking my enemies on the jaw" (one of the all time greatest bands: Jawbreaker, not relevant, but something that came to mind >.  I can't say that my worries ended for good after one prayer to God. I prayed alot, and one thing is sure, God is the reason I wasn't psychologically scarred for life =). Verse 8 says that "from the Lord comes deliverance", so have faith that He will. Quit worrying.  It's not easy, and it might never be to have enemies around you. But God promises a better way out by lifting your fears to Him, and trusting and believing that He's watching over you. This is an appealing alternative to thinking we can cope with the world alone.

      A Dead Girl and a Sick Woman    40Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him. 41Then a man named Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come to his house 42because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying.  43As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him. And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years,[1] but no one could heal her. 44She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.  45"Who touched me?" Jesus asked.  When they all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you."  46But Jesus said, "Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me."  47Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. 48Then he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace."  49While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. "Your daughter is dead," he said. "Don't bother the teacher any more."  50Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, "Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed."  51When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child's father and mother. 52Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. "Stop wailing," Jesus said. "She is not dead but asleep."  53They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. 54But he took her by the hand and said, "My child, get up!" 55Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat. 56Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.   This passage is about amazing, childlike faith, which i wish i had.Isn't it beautiful, how Jesus' love comes through to those who believe in Him? He is amazing. Of course He is, He's God!  We'll take a look at the sick woman tonight. The Bible tells us that she had been subject to bleeding for 12 years. We need to feel her pain, look at her sickness,her prison through her eyes.  Back in those times, when a woman has her period, she was considered "unclean". She was not allowed in the temple until she had cleansed herself. This woman had been suffering from bleeding for 12 years. She had spent all her money on doctors. Can you imagine? No going to the temple like normal people, no offering, no praying to God,nothing! All her friends must have looked down on her because she was "unclean". They probably believed that her sickness was the result of some great sin in her life or her ancestors'. She was like an outcast.  How long those 12 years must have seemed! She must have spent them longing to be healed, trying every means possible, maybe even cursing herself and spending days with a storm inside her. Why was life so unfair?? What had she done to deserve this? She must have had hope after hope crushed when each doctor she paid could do nothing for her.   Then along comes Jesus. There must have been something about Him that made her believe in Him. Maybe Jesus had that kind of greatness, kindness, a kind of light around Him. Maybe if you looked into His eyes you'd see so much love your heart would  melt. Jesus was that kind of a man. She believed, reached out and touched the edge of His cloak...and she was healed! It's like the light was switched on after years of darkness, like a spring bubbling out of a long-dry hole.   Then he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace."   Your faith has made you well. Sometimes, when I'm hurt or sick, or if my friends are, I lay my hands on them and pray. And the pain doesn't go away. Then I ask God, you know,  why didn't You heal her?  I believed that You could, why didn't You do something? I'm supposed to be Your heir,I'm supposed to have the Holy Spirit power, why didn't the sickness go away?  I don't know why God heals some people instantly, and others over a period of time. I don't know why God performs miracles for some, but not for others. Then I realise, it's the same thing as asking God why He doesn't part Selat Tebrau whenever I want to go to Singapore. Maybe the need just isn't there. Some people may need miracles to believe in Him, others have hearts so hard that a miracle wouldn't convince them anyway. We just don't know. I have to believe in God's incredible wisdom. He sees the whole picture, and i just see a dot.  I do know this, though. God gave His Word, and His Word says,   "So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. (Luke 11:9)   Love, Jenna

       1 Thessalonians 2 3For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives, nor are we trying to trick you. 4On the contrary, we speak as men approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel. We are not trying to please men but God, who tests our hearts. 5You know we never used flattery, nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed--God is our witness. 6We were not looking for praise from men, not from you or anyone else.  7As apostles of Christ we could have been a burden to you, but we were gentle among you, like a mother caring for her little children. 8We loved you so much that we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well, because you had become so dear to us. 9Surely you remember, brothers, our toil and hardship; we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preached the gospel of God to you.   High school, I feel, has more hidden agendas than discipline cases. Are the prefects doing what they do to serve the school? Or is it for that invaluable certificate they receive at the end of their service. I'm in no way condemning prefects, heck, I'm one myself. Even among friends, how many of us can claim to be nice to each other without some hidden motive?   Why does a guy put up with the friends of the girl he likes? Why do people treat the rich kid so nicely if he's a boring person?   Even when it comes to living a Christian life, our motives can get distorted along the way. Christians aren't immune to the distortion of the world. Our motives can become clouded just as easily as anyone else.  Here's the thing, if you're the leader of a band playing main stage at this huge Christian Youth Conference merely to impress someone, chances are no one in the crowd would be able to tell immediately. Here's the other thing, God knows exactly why you're on that stage. God knows what you're in it for, and sometimes that's a scary thought.  All hidden agendas and distorted motivations are seen by God. The world may not see anything other than a perfect person constantly doing good things, but I guess we'd be hyppocrites in God's eyes. What do we do? Rely on God, and remember He tests' our hearts.  Your friend, Kevin*

       Jesus Washes His Disciples' Feet    1It was just before the Passover Feast. Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love.[1] 2The evening meal was being served, and the devil had already prompted Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, to betray Jesus. 3Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God; 4so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist. 5After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him. 6He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?" 7Jesus replied, "You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand." 8"No," said Peter, "you shall never wash my feet." Jesus answered, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with me." 9"Then, Lord," Simon Peter replied, "not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!" 10Jesus answered, "A person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet; his whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you." 11For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean. 12When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. "Do you understand what I have done for you?" he asked them. 13"You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and rightly so, for that is what I am. 14Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet. 15I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you. 16I tell you the truth, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. 17Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.   "He now showed them the  full extent of His love ." Jesus was their Companion, their Teacher, their Lord, their Friend. He ate with them, walked with them, and taught them everything He knew they needed to know. Because He loved them,right? Then you have this Bible passage. This is when Jesus literally  served  them. Is this what showing others love is all about? Sure, eating lunch with them and having fun with them is loving them, but serving them...dirtying your hands, crushing your pride to serve them.   What is so big about the washing of the feet? Let me lay it out for you...  In those days, there was cow dung and donkey dung  everywhere.  Public toilet. Plus there were no shoes...the disciples must have been walking for  miles , on dusty roads,  everywhere , in their worn out sandals. "Watch out, Peter...*yech* ..too late"... Washing feet were left to the servants, the slaves. It just simply wasn't done by respectable people.  Keep the image of dung covered, stench emitting, dusty, dirty, big feet in your head for a while. Now get this: Jesus took off his outer clothing ( like a servant!), stooped down, (head level with the sweet feet), took a basin of water, and washed them. Wow!  You think that's hard? There's  more .   Judas Iscariot.  ....Judas Iscariot .  He was one of the Twelve. Jesus must've talked with him, broke bread with him, helped him tons of times! And he betrayed Jesus, his Friend, for money. Jesus knew that, and  He still washed Judas' feet.                                        .......... Now imagine this. You've been working for 3 months on a special science project, in hopes of winning a new desktop. Every night for 3 months, you've been spending hours doing research, making dozens of prototypes, adding the finishing touches, so that you could get the new desktop to play RO, or Star Wars. 2 days before the dateline, you go to the lab, open the cupboard, and find out its missing! You're devastated. The next month, your best friend, Lewie, wins the desktop, and  you realise that he stole your project .   Would you still get down and wash Lewie's dung-covered, dusty, stench emitting feet?    "Do you understand what I have done for you?" he asked them. 13"You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and rightly so, for that is what I am. 14 Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet    Signing off, Jenna

      Nehemiah 1:5-11  5 Then I said:   "O LORD , God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and obey his commands, 6 let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer your servant is praying before you day and night for your servants, the people of Israel. I confess the sins we Israelites, including myself and my father's house, have committed against you. 7 We have acted very wickedly toward you. We have not obeyed the commands, decrees and laws you gave your servant Moses.  8 "Remember the instruction you gave your servant Moses, saying, 'If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations, 9 but if you return to me and obey my commands, then even if your exiled people are at the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for my Name.'  10 "They are your servants and your people, whom you redeemed by your great strength and your mighty hand. 11 O Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of this your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight in revering your name. Give your servant success today by granting him favor in the presence of this man."   I was cupbearer to the king.   What comes first, a prayer or a need? There are things we instantly go to God in prayer for, things that we know prayer is the best solution for. Family problems, financial difficulties, death, these are things an average teenager might need help with. Prayer's the best we can do, when nothing we do appears to be any good.  Nehemiah knew the needs of the Israelites, and recognized prayer as being the best thing to do. In the story, God didn't give what was asked immediately (it took four months before Nehemiah was granted what he asked). I guess everyone can identify with this. Or at the very least, the wait.  This can be fustrating, especially for teens (God knows we're a pampered lot) who're so used to getting what we want. Yeah, there're always lessons stressing the importance of praying according to God's will. I doubt God will answer my brother's prayer to blow up our school. But I think there's more than that.  I can remember many things I've prayed for (some way more important than others) that only got answered after some time. It would've been nice to have gotten what I needed when I asked for it, but that's the attitude alot of us have. We want what we want when we want it. What we fail to recognize is God's infinite smartness in knowing what's best for us. Often times we're going to have to wait for prayer to be answered, but God being so wonderful, we should trust his timing as well as it's probably the best for us.  Nehemiah waited, and got what he prayed for. I guess sometimes we just need to have faith that God's will  AND  timing are way more precise than ours. Basically, pray faithfully and wait faithfully.   Not my will be done, but God's and according to his clock.  Your friend, Kevin*

       1 I will praise you, O LORD , with all my heart;  before the "gods" I will sing your praise.  2 I will bow down toward your holy temple  and will praise your name  for your love and your faithfulness,  for you have exalted above all things  your name and your word.   3 When I called, you answered me;  you made me bold and stouthearted.    4 May all the kings of the earth praise you, O LORD ,  when they hear the words of your mouth.  5 May they sing of the ways of the LORD ,  for the glory of the LORD is great.   6 Though the LORD is on high, he looks upon the lowly,  but the proud he knows from afar.  7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble,  you preserve my life;  you stretch out your hand against the anger of my foes,  with your right hand you save me.   8 The LORD will fulfill his purpose for me;  your love, O LORD , endures forever-  do not abandon the works of your hands.    Whenever I read psalms of David, it hits me how little I know God. I mean, I've never felt the urge to sincerely write a song about God's love, faithfulness, and glory. Especially glory. King David spent his life worshipping God, and I can only imagine how close he was to God.  " When I called, you answered me; you made me bold and stouthearted" (v3) God answers prayers. He really does! Whenever I'm scared, and all alone, this verse says that all I have to do is call out to Him, and He'll give me all the courage I need.   "The Lord will fulfill his purpose for me" (v8) Doesn't that sound amazing? God has a purpose for every being He ever created, did you know that? I look at myself, now, and think; there's no way I'll ever bring millions to Christ, or heal the blind, or touch lives. But think; God is such a BIG God, He must have BIG plans for each person.  His love endures forever..  Signing out, Jenna

       Luke 10  Jesus Sends Out the Seventy-two  1After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go. 2He told them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field. 3Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves. 4Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do not greet anyone on the road. 5"When you enter a house, first say, 'Peace to this house.' 6If a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; if not, it will return to you. 7Stay in that house, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house. 8"When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is set before you. 9Heal the sick who are there and tell them, 'The kingdom of God is near you.' 10But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say, 11'Even the dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God is near.' 12I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town.  17The seventy-two returned with joy and said, "Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name." 18He replied, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. 19I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you. 20However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven."   I've always thought of the gospels as stories of Jesus' life on earth. They tell us what he did, so we can choose to follow him in he way he lived his life. They also tell us about him dying on the cross for our sins, and rising from the dead. I believe the gospel also tells us to spread the word of God.  The passage is basically about evangalizing, and how Jesus sent out his followers. It tells us how his followers had power over many evil things in Jesus' name.  See, we live in the period of time after Jesus' death and resurrection and before his second coming. This is supposed to be the most crucial stage in all of history, where the world is in turmoil (actual or spiritual). As Christians, we're supposed to spread the word of God to do our bit in these end times. And basically, we have nothing to fear while doing that. We have great power with us.

          2 Timothy 1      &nbsp;   6For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands. 7For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and of self-discipline. 8So do not be ashamed to testify about our Lord, or ashamed of me his prisoner. But join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God, 9who has saved us and called us to a holy life--not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time, 10but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. 11And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher. 12That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet I am not ashamed, because I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him for that day.     I can imagine my days would be rather different without the Holy Spirit around. By this I mean that&nbsp;in everyday life, it feels like the only thing&nbsp;keeping me from messing everything up all the time is the Holy Spirit. Sure&nbsp;we do mess up (alot), but the Holy Spirit changes lives.   With the spirit, we're cloaked with power from above. Verse 7 says we're given a spirit of love, power, and self discipline. This comes in handy especially in dealing with the people we meet in our everyday lives. Were it not for this divine intervention, there'd be chaos. However, the spirit isn't just to keep things in reasonable shape, but it is to enhance our lives.

        1 Samuel 20  9 "Never!" Jonathan said. "If I had the least inkling that my father was determined to harm you, wouldn't I tell you?"  10 David asked, "Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?"  11 "Come," Jonathan said, "let's go out into the field." So they went there together.  12 Then Jonathan said to David: "By the LORD , the God of Israel, I will surely sound out my father by this time the day after tomorrow! If he is favorably disposed toward you, will I not send you word and let you know? 13 But if my father is inclined to harm you, may the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if I do not let you know and send you away safely. May the LORD be with you as he has been with my father. 14 But show me unfailing kindness like that of the LORD as long as I live, so that I may not be killed, 15 and do not ever cut off your kindness from my family-not even when the LORD has cut off every one of David's enemies from the face of the earth."  16 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, "May the LORD call David's enemies to account." 17  And Jonathan had David reaffirm his oath out of love for him, because he loved him as he loved himself.      Then Jonathan said to David ...22 But if I say to the boy, 'Look, the arrows are beyond you,' then you must go, because the LORD has sent you away.    41 After the boy had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone and bowed down before Jonathan three times, with his face to the ground.  Then they kissed each other and wept together-but David wept the most.   42 Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, for we have sworn friendship with each other in the name of the LORD , saying, 'The LORD is witness between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants forever.' " Then David left, and Jonathan went back to the town.    THE story of David and Jonathan is a beautiful one. It tells of the friendship between 2 men of God. Jonathans' father, King Saul, was out to kill David, and Jonathan wasn't about to let that happen. He swore to help David  escape his father, and in doing so he saved the person who was about to be the greatest king of all. If you read further on, you'll find out that Jonathan and King Saul die in the end, in the war between David's men and Saul's men.  In the new testament, Paul urges us to love one another like brothers, to uphold each other in righteousness,etc.I think that Paul wasn't just referring to some wishy-washy love, or liking. I think that Jesus truly wants us to have the same kind of friendship with each other that Jonathan and David had. It's a tall order, but through God all things are possible, right?  I have a friend, who's also a believer, and who annoys me sometimes. Sometimes the only thing that keeps me from biting her head off is the fact that I know she loves the same Jesus I do. And the fact that Jesus loves her. The reason why I don't want to get into an argument with her is because I figure that if I hurt her, I'd be hurting someone my Best Friend really loves. It'd be like hurting your best friend's son or daughter, (or if you're as young as me, something to that effect)  I'm going to try to build up relationships with other children of God, and maybe one day I'll have a friendship and a love that David and Jonathan shared.  I love you, brother.(or sister)  Signing off, Jenna

             Luke 12    &nbsp;  16And he told them this parable: "The ground of a certain rich man produced a good crop. 17He thought to himself, 'What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.' 18"Then he said, 'This is what I'll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. 19And I'll say to myself, "You have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry." ' 20"But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?' 21"This is how it will be with anyone who stores up things for himself but is not rich toward God."

        Numbers 14  26 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron: 27 "How long will this wicked community grumble against me? I have heard the complaints of these grumbling Israelites. 28 So tell them, 'As surely as I live, declares the LORD , I will do to you the very things I heard you say: 29 In this desert your bodies will fall-every one of you twenty years old or more who was counted in the census and who has grumbled against me. 30 Not one of you will enter the land I swore with uplifted hand to make your home, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun. 31 As for your children that you said would be taken as plunder, I will bring them in to enjoy the land you have rejected. 32 But you-your bodies will fall in this desert. 33 Your children will be shepherds here for forty years, suffering for your unfaithfulness, until the last of your bodies lies in the desert. 34  For forty years-one year for each of the forty days you explored the land-you will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have me against you.'  35 I, the LORD , have spoken, and I will surely do these things to this whole wicked community, which has banded together against me. They will meet their end in this desert; here they will die."     The Israelites had pushed God's limit.  He brought them out of slavery, prepared for them a land flowing with milk and honey, gave them manna ( bread that fell out of the sky) to eat, brought water out of rock for them to drink in the dessert, defeated  their enemies, parted the Red Sea...and all the while they complained, broke His commandments, and complained some more. After all the miracles He performed for them, they still doubted His Promise.   Some of us are like those Israelites, we complain and refuse to put all our problems in His Hands. When things get rough, we are blind to how God is helping us, we immediately decide to complain and whine about why God isn't around.  Did you know that from Eygpt  (where the Israelites were held in captivity)  to the Promised Land is only a few days journey? Because of their disobedience, the Israelites ended up wandering around in the dessert for forty years. It's crazy isn't it? They were wandering around in circles when all the while they were  very near the promised land.   It's like us, really. Sometimes we make things so difficult for ourselves by trying to solve our problems our way, when all the time God is waiting patiently to lift us out of the maze of confusion we're in. It's like someone in a high tower, over a maze, He can see the easy way out, and is shouting and waving to us, giving instructions from up there, but we're ignoring Him, instead trying to bulldoze our way through the hedges.   Anyway, back to the Israelites. After forty years of being disobeyed, God finally decided to not give them the Promised Land at all! Instead, they were doomed to die in the dessert, all but Joshua and Caleb, who were the only ones who trusted in Him.  But God is a good God, and He saved that Land for the children. Do you want to end up like the Israelites? We, like them, will someday be judged. The Judgement Day is coming...don't be caught unawares. Jesus said that Day will come like a thief in the night, and no one will expect it. Make things right with God before it is too late.  Signing off, Jenna

           Hosea 14     &nbsp;   Repentance to Bring Blessing     &nbsp;   &nbsp;1 Return, O Israel, to the LORD your God. Your sins have been your downfall! 2 Take words with you and return to the LORD . Say to him: "Forgive all our sins and receive us graciously, that we may offer the fruit of our lips. 3 Assyria cannot save us; we will not mount war-horses. We will never again say 'Our gods' to what our own hands have made, for in you the fatherless find compassion." 4 "I will heal their waywardness and love them freely, for my anger has turned away from them. 5 I will be like the dew to Israel; he will blossom like a lily. Like a cedar of Lebanon he will send down his roots; 6 his young shoots will grow. His splendor will be like an olive tree, his fragrance like a cedar of Lebanon. 7 Men will dwell again in his shade. He will flourish like the grain. He will blossom like a vine, and his fame will be like the wine from Lebanon. 8 O Ephraim, what more have I to do with idols? I will answer him and care for him. I am like a green pine tree; your fruitfulness comes from me." 9 Who is wise? He will realize these things. Who is discerning? He will understand them. The ways of the LORD are right; the righteous walk in them, but the rebellious stumble in them.      Never ruin an apology with an excuse.&nbsp;- Kimberly Johnson      There are some instances where we just find it impossible to admit we're wrong. We still apologize, but it's along the lines of "I'm sorry I didn't get it done but it's because he didn't do his part". It's funny the way people think the important part is saying 'sorry', thinking it qualifies as an apology.  When we sin against God, we ask forgiveness. When we ask forgiveness, do we also say "But the devil made me do it..."? See, when we give excuses and reasons, it sort of defeats the purpose of an apology. When we say we're sorry, what we should be saying is how utterly wrong we were, and that we have no excuse for our actions.  There's a difference between being sorry about the consequences of our actions, and being sorry that we disobeyed God. It's the same difference between someone who's sorry for cheating on a test, and someone who's sorry he  got caught  cheating on a test.  We shouldn't have to flood our apologies and confessions to God with excuses, for we know God forgives us. And besides, if you're really sorry you'd know that no excuse is good enough anyway.

           Acts 10       Cornelius Calls for Peter      1At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment. 2He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly.  3One day at about three in the afternoon he had a vision. He distinctly saw an angel of God, who came to him and said, "Cornelius!" 4Cornelius stared at him in fear. "What is it, Lord?" he asked. 5The angel answered, "Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God. Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter. 6He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea." 7When the angel who spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants.     23Then Peter invited the men into the house to be his guests.    Peter at Cornelius' House    24The next day Peter started out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa went along. The following day he arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had  called together his relatives and close friends.  25As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence. 26But Peter made him get up. "Stand up," he said, "I am only a man myself."  27Talking with him, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people. 28He said to them: "You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with a Gentile or visit him.  But God has shown me that I should not call any man impure or unclean.  29So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. May I ask why you sent for me?"  30Cornelius answered: "Four days ago I was in my house praying at this hour, at three in the afternoon. Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me 31and said,  'Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor.  32Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.' 33So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us."      Cornelius was a good man, he gave to the poor and prayed daily. His act of giving to the poor came up as a memorial offering before God! I wonder how many of the things i are worthy to be brought as an offering to God.    There have been plenty of times when i 'blemish' my offerings to God. Sometimes i do good deeds to get the praise of other people, and sometimes i do it just because i feel obliged to. Very rarely are there times when i do serve others because i  want  to, when i feel that stirring in the heart,(  love, maybe?) to really take on other people's burdens.    One question that came up to me tonight was,  "&nbsp;How many sacrifices have&nbsp;i made in&nbsp;my life that God would be pleased with?"  I honestly don't know.    God looks at the heart.It's not the value of the things we offer that matter (after all, He owns the universe), but the eagerness in our hearts to please Him. Everything we do should be centred around "Would&nbsp;Jesus like this?"&nbsp;     Cornelius was sincere in his giving to the poor, and look what happened! God sent an&nbsp;angel to him in a vision, and told him to send for Peter... Cornelius was so excited about this man of God that he invited all his family and close friends! Peter came, and if you read further on, you'll find out that everyone accepted Christ, and  the Holy Spirit  came down on them. This is the first time in the Bible that the Holy Spirit came down on Gentiles (non-Jews like you and me!)And it was all because one man decided to centre his focus on God.   God used the sincere heart of one man to save many. It can happen to you and i, if we are willing to give it all to God, and to say,   "Here I am, Lord, use me."

        Luke 12    Do Not Worry    22Then Jesus said to his disciples:  "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear.  23Life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. 24Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds! 25Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life[1] ? 26Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?  27"Consider how the lilies grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. 28If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith! 29And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it. 30For the pagan world runs after all such things, and  your Father knows that you need them.   31But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well.    32"Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom.  33Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will not be exhausted, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. 34For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.    Footnotes  12:25 Or single cubit to his height   Do not worry, do not worry, do not worry. I find this so hard sometimes. Sometimes it feels like I was  born  a worrier or something. Ever caught yourself worrying about whether you'll be able to handle a certain project, or what would happen if Pn Sabina finds out you didn't do your EST? Of course you have. It drives me crazy, imagining all sorts of horrible possibilities, that anyone in their right mind would point out as improbable.   Jesus tells us that, hey, if God feeds the birds of the sky, how much more will He feed us? God loves us so much more than the birds and the grass, we're His children after all. We don't need to worry because God will take care of us. God knows what we need.     31But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well.   This is a wonderful promise. Forget about your worries. Forget about that teacher you frustrated in add math class. Forget that exam that's coming up soon. God knows you need help in these, but to Him, there are much greater and more valuable things worth working for. Love, wisdom, understanding,peace...seek the things of  God, and all the rest will be  given to you as well.   I know it's easier to glean all this from a passage then to actually live it out. I don't know if i'll be able to fully let go of all my  cares, and let myself freefall, just trusting that i will soar on eagle's wings. Sometimes it's so hard to just let go, to trust God completely, to lean not on our own understanding, because God just doesn't feel real at that point in your life.   I really need God's help. I've asked Him for it, prayed for it night after night, so why won't I let Him help me?'Stop worrying,' He tells me, ' Let my peace enfold you', but i wave it away and continue worrying. 'I can get rid of your problems for you,' He says, lovingly, but i continue trying to deal with it on my own.   Trusting God is simple, but so not easy.

             Romans 5     &nbsp;  6You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. 7Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die. 8But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 9Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him! 10For if, when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life! 11Not only is this so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.

        Romans 5  Death Through Adam, Life Through Christ  12Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned-- 13for before the law was given, sin was in the world. But sin is not taken into account when there is no law. 14Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who was a pattern of the one to come. 15But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many! 16Again, the gift of God is not like the result of the one man's sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification. 17For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ. 18Consequently, just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men. 19For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous. 20The law was added so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more, 21so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.   The lyrics to the song 'What's So Funny ('Bout Peace, Love &amp; Understanding)' by Elvis Costello say alot really. "As I walk through this wicked world, searching for light in the darkness of insanity..." says what alot of us feel, that the world is inherently (for the most part, at least) a cold place full of evil. Essentially, it is true but not in a pessimistic way. See, according to Paul; the world is full of sin because of what Adam did. That single mistake thousands of years ago caused all of mankind to be predisposed to sin. Sin and death entered the world through one man (verse 12), the moment Adam disobeyed God. So the way things stand, by right; we should have no chance at all. We're all sinners from the day we're born, and indeed peace, love &amp; understanding should be alien concepts to us.  Fortunately, Jesus came to save us. In Romans 5, it says Jesus came to put right the sins that started from Adam. While condemnation followed that one sin of Adam, justification followed the many, many sins of all men. So you see, because of Adam, all men are born with a tendency to sin easily. On the other hand, those who come to know Jesus will be born again in Him.  The world isn't a nice place (perhaps so we long for heaven) some of the time. It's this way because of sin. God has sent Jesus so that we have the chance to be saved from death. And while we're here on earth, by trusting in Jesus, we'll be moved by the Holy Spirit to live a life more pleasing to God. We're sinners because of Adam, we're saved from it because of Jesus. We have no excuses: What's so funny about peace, love &amp; understanding?

        1 Timothy 5   8If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his immediate family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.  9No widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty, has been  faithful to her husband,[1] 10and is well known for her good deeds, such as bringing up children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of the saints, helping those in trouble and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds.   11As for younger widows, do not put them on such a list.  For when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they want to marry.  12Thus they bring judgment on themselves, because they have broken their first pledge. 13Besides, they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things they ought not to. 14So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have children, to manage their homes and to  give the enemy no opportunity for slander.  15Some have in fact already turned away to follow Satan.  16If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family, she should help them and not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows who are really in need.   Footnotes 5:9 Or has had but one husband   Yay! A passage for young women! :) Hehe.A list of all the virtues i should have...showing hospitality, washing feet, helping others in trouble...wowowow...tall order. :Pi know that i am far from being the type of woman Peter mentions here.  It's so cool...   For when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they want to marry.  ...i have to think about this one. there are plenty of things that distract us from God, lots of things that take the number 1 spot in our lives.    give the enemy no opportunity for slander...  this one. ah. it means don't do something you know others will dislike, people who wasn't chosen for this.

        1 Corinthians 1   Christ the Wisdom and Power of God   18For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 19For it is written:     "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise;         the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate."  20Where is the wise man? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 21For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. 22Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks look for wisdom, 23but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, 24but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. 25For the foolishness of God is wiser than man's wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than man's strength.    The SPM is only about a hundred days away, and it gets scary whenever I think about the amount of things I have to know. I'd hardly consider what I'm learning to be knowledge, seeing as most of my fellow SPM candidated memorise the facts and regurgitate them during exams. This is of course, essentially what needs to be done for the SPM.  However, when we consider knowledge to be things we know, we are rather knowledgable as a species. The human race has progressed so far, and mankind now has few boundaries in the search for knowledge and truth. I guess knowledge, and knowing how knowledgable we are, can be our downfall.  We seem to get defensive whenever it appears our knowledge has limitations. I can go insane when people say I have bad music taste (seeing as I research each CD before I buy it, making my CD collection impeccable, to me at least). Those people who can't take criticism, probably can't take the idea of their knowledge being imperfect.  When we think we know so much, it impairs our ability to hear biblical truth. The bible in fact tells us the truth about truth, if that makes any sense. God is all powerful and wise, and in verse 19, it shows that God will make us see how unknowledgable we actually are. So we as a species, must know what knowledge really is. God's word is the truth, and that's what we should cling on to.  Your friend, Kevin

        Luke 2    The Birth of Jesus  1In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. 2(This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.) 3And everyone went to his own town to register.  4So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. 5He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. 6While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, 7and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.    The Shepherds and the Angels  8And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. 9An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. 10But the angel said to them,  "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. 11Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ[1] the Lord. 12This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."   13Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,       14"Glory to God in the highest,         and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests."   15When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about."  16So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. 17When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, 18and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. 19But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. 20The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.    Footnotes  2:11 Or Messiah. "The Christ" (Greek) and "the Messiah" (Hebrew) both mean "the Anointed One"; also in verse 26.   It's a nice story, isn't it? What do you think that first night was like? Maybe the night sky was filled with stars, and the breeze whispered to the trees that there was something in the wind. Those sheep in the field, now, do you think they felt the very specialness of that night? I would give anything to be one of those shepards, to have angels appear to you while you were star-gazing, and have them tell you the good news of great joy.   "The Messiah is born, the Messiah is born..."  Maybe there was something in the air that night. Look in the stables. Mary and Joseph, looking at their new born baby, their special son. Mary must've been so happy just looking at the miracle God gave her. And the shepards arrive, and the wise men, all to worship the baby Jesus.  Our King was born in a manger. There's somehing significant about that, about the very humble beginning Jesus had in our world.   That night, God and the angels must've been happy, apprehensive, sad, all at once. The time had finally come, the Plan set into motion. Jesus' mission had begun.  That night, men and women were asleep in their beds, not dreaming of the gift that was Jesus.

        1 John 4   God's Love and Ours   7Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. 8Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 10This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. 11Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.    All the love songs in the world will still fail to express the love that God has for us. Perhaps the lyric that best suits it would be from 'Love Letter Typewriter' by Mineral: "Will you ever know how much I love you?".   Verse nine says God's love was shown when he sent his only son to die for us, for our salvation. If God didn't love us, there'd be no chance of us being saved from death. It's incomprehensible how God could love us that much, to sacrifice Jesus for sinners such as us.  How much do we value God's love for us? More than money? More than success? More than a nice car? If we value God's love, we have to live it. Verse eleven says because God loved us, we have to love one another. We have to love others in the way God loves us, regardless of how others treat us. Basically, love like Jesus.  Maybe we'll never know how much God loves us. But knowing that He loves us more than we can understand is probably a good thing. Let's keep God's love dear to our hearts, for it's because of it that we're saved.  Your friend, Kevin

        Hebrews 12    God Disciplines His Sons    1Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses , let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us. 2Let us  fix our eyes on Jesus , the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. 3Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.  4In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. 5And you have forgotten that word of encouragement that addresses you as sons:      "My son, do not make light of the Lord's discipline,         and do not lose heart when he rebukes you,      6because the Lord disciplines those he loves,         and he punishes everyone he accepts as a son."[1]   7Endure hardship as discipline;  God is treating you as sons.  For what son is not disciplined by his father? 8If you are not disciplined (and everyone undergoes discipline), then you are illegitimate children and not true sons. 9Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of our spirits and live! 10Our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, that we may share in his holiness.  11No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.   Footnotes  12:6 Prov. 3:11,12   Who are the great cloud of witnesses that Paul is talking about? Paul is talking about Gideon, Samson, David, Samuel and the prophets, those who have already finished the race...    "...who shut the mouths of lions, 34quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies. 35Women received back their dead, raised to life again. Others were tortured and refused to be released, so that they might gain a better resurrection. 36Some faced jeers and flogging, while still others were chained and put in prison. 37They were stoned[6] ; they were sawed in two; they were put to death by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated-- 38the world was not worthy of them." (Hebrews 11)   Guess what? Paul goes on to say that... "39These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised. 40God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect."   These mighty people of the past, God's chosen men and women, all those who have gone before us,  they're cheering us on  . It's like running in the stadium, where the stands are full of former athletes, all groaning when you fall, and encouraging you to get up again. Each cheering you on as you continue your race. They can't wait till you finish the race!   God's Discipline    "My son, do not make light of the Lord's discipline,         and do not lose heart when he rebukes you,      6because the Lord disciplines those he loves,         and he punishes everyone he accepts as a son."[1]   When i read this, i can't help wishing that God would discipline me more. I know this sounds crazy, but it makes me feel like i'm not much of a daughter, because i haven't been disciplined for so long! It's not only the disciplining that i'm talking about, it's really the fruit that comes out of it that i want. Sometimes i feel like i'm no good, like i'm not growing. Stunted, somehow. And i'd wish God would change me, no matter how painful it is.   Sometimes i don't seem to believe with my heart. Sometimes i feel so tired of worshipping, so tired of praying, or caring, even. It's times like these, when i feel void of feelings and emotion, that i wish something horrible would happen. Just something to make me  feel . I'm just talking crazy talk. Or can you relate to me?  It's the feeling like you're burnt out. Like when you ask God for revival but nothing seems to happen. Like you want that fire to burn again.  Still, i'll never let Him go. Though from where i am right now, even a little pain won't seem so bad.  Signing off, Jenna p.s the authoress asks for forgiveness for the way she went a little off track today.

        Mark 12   Marriage at the Resurrection   18Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. 19"Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother. 20Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any children. 21The second one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. It was the same with the third. 22In fact, none of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died too. 23At the resurrection[1] whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?"  24Jesus replied, "Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God? 25When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven. 26Now about the dead rising--have you not read in the book of Moses, in the account of the bush, how God said to him, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'[2] ? 27He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!"    I'll be perfectly honest with you, I am scared to death of commitment as serious as marriage. I guess that's part of being 17, wanting no part in something that will change my life forever. This passage may not have much relevance to teenage life, but still it always helps to look at the bigger picture.  The Sadducees asked Jesus about a highly improbable, hypothetical situation hoping to stump him. What are the chances of a whole family of brothers marrying the same woman? I guess when I'm twenty-something, this passage will have some newfound significance. Jesus was too bright for them as usual.  See, according to Jesus, there's no such thing as marriage in heaven. Doesn't sound bad at all to me! According to Jesus, we'll be something like angels, all having perfect relationships with one another that will be far more fulfilling than any marriage could be.  If we look at the bigger picture, we'll see that what awaits us in heaven is far greater than any joy that we'll experience on earth. Laughing with your friends would be the equavalent to a shot of morphine, a temporary high when compared to what's yet to come. In terms of marriage, I'm guessing that in heaven our relationships will be perfect unlike marriage.  Disclaimer: I do not take responsibility for any views concerning marriage. I'm only 17 after all...  Your friend, Kevin

        Proverbs 1    Warning Against Rejecting Wisdom   20 Wisdom calls aloud in the street,  she raises her voice in the public squares;  21 at the head of the noisy streets [1] she cries out,  in the gateways of the city she makes her speech:   22 "How long will you simple ones [2] love your simple ways?  How long will mockers delight in mockery  and fools hate knowledge?  23 If you had responded to my rebuke,  I would have poured out my heart to you  and made my thoughts known to you.  24 But since  you rejected me when I called   and  no one gave heed when I stretched out my hand,   25  since you ignored all my advice  and would not accept my rebuke,   26 I in turn will laugh at your disaster;  I will mock when calamity overtakes you-  27 when calamity overtakes you like a storm,  when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind,  when distress and trouble overwhelm you.   28 "Then they will call to me but I will not answer;  they will look for me but will not find me.  29 Since they hated knowledge  and did not choose to fear the LORD ,   30 since they would not accept my advice  and spurned my rebuke,  31 they will eat the fruit of their ways  and be filled with the fruit of their schemes.   32 For the waywardness of the simple will kill them,  and the complacency of fools will destroy them;  33 but whoever listens to me will live in safety  and be at ease, without fear of harm."   Footnotes  1:21 Hebrew; Septuagint / on the tops of the walls  1:22 The Hebrew word rendered simple in Proverbs generally denotes one without moral direction and inclined to evil.   The warning running through this passage is "don't ignore God's advice, don't spurn His rebuke! If you do...dielah." Something along those lines. A few important things to take note: 1.   You don't just get one chance, then  die  if you fail.  You get many.  Read vs 20-21. Wisdom  calls aloud  in the streets, she  raises her voice  in public squares, in the city gates she makes her speech. God tries lots of time to get you to listen, to stop  you from walking straight over the cliff or into some bog, where you will sink deeper and deeper. Don't blame God when things go wrong in your life. He gave you His Word, you didn't listen.  2.  It isn't God who causes the trouble. It's us.   32 For the waywardness of the simple will kill them,  and the complacency of fools will destroy them;   Sometimes we are so quick to question God when things go wrong. "God, why didn't you stop this from happening? How could you let this happen? Don't you love me?" Of course He loves you. He sent His Son to die for you. Sometimes, when things go wrong, maybe we should sit down and reflect on what  we did wrong. Did we disobey God? Break all 10 commandments?    There are some things that just can't be helped. Persecution, pain, tears; they all come at one point or the other. Just remember this promise:   33 but whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease, without fear of harm."

        Ephesians 3   A Prayer for the Ephesians   14For this reason I kneel before the Father, 15from whom his whole family[1] in heaven and on earth derives its name. 16I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, 17so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, 18may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, 19and to know this love that surpasses knowledge--that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.  20Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, 21to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.  Footnotes 3:15 Or whom all fatherhood    This might get me some flak from some people, but sometimes I wish I were a Jedi (those lightsabre weilding folk from Star Wars). Just so you know, in the Star Wars universe, the Jedi are a bunch of people who have special powers. Their power comes from the "force", a cosmic power that binds them all together which enables them to have lightning reflexes, mind-control power, and physical manipulative abilities (push and pull objects from afar). In the Star Wars movies, you can tell who are Jedi because they have these ultra-cool laser swords called lightsabres. However, their main powers come from the force. It's not merely the source of an outward power, but it is their whole being.  Please keep in mind this is all fiction. However, the same principles apply in our Christian lives. While we may never jump into battles with lightsabres deflecting laser bolts while resolving an intergalactic dispute, we have more in common with the Jedi in the way we live our lives than some Star Trek fans may like to think.  As Christians, we draw our power from God. In the same way the force allows a Jedi to get out of problems that he can't with a lightsabre, we can only endure what gets thrown at us by drawing power from God. Our "lightsabres" (our own strenght, support from other people) can only get us so far, but in the end it is God who gives us the strenght to go on. Try as we might, our batteries would run out leaving us with nothing if we did not have the power of His Spirit (verse 16).  A Jedi has to go through rigorous training to strenghten his power and understanding in the force, since it's not something they can just use wield. The same goes for Christians when we call on God for strenght to cope with everything around us. As Christians, we have to train ourselves in the "force" as well. The Holy Spirit strenghtens us and renews our minds when we read the bible, when we pray, and when we fellowship with other believers. Our training is to have a strong relationship with God. Without this, we will be unable to withstand the temptations and pressure of the dark side.  We know we have God and the power of Christ within us. When it comes down to it, the troubles of the world will be bearable because of the strenght we have from God. May the force be with you.  Your friend, Kevin*

        2 Corinthians 5  17Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come! 18All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: 19that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting men's sins against them. And  he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.  20We are therefore  Christ's ambassadors , as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ's behalf: Be reconciled to God.   Sometimes i like to look back on the past few years, and see if God has changed me any. Would i be the same person if I didn't know God? After looking back on things, the answer has to be, "no". I wouldn't have as much patience as I have now, I would have argued and hurt a lot of people, and i'd probably have a string of broken relationships.  It's true, you know, that if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. I think for a lot of us, the changes don't happen overnight. It's a gradual process. But it happens. Take time to stop on reflect on how knowing Jesus has changed your life.   It's so important to let God come into your life, and change you. There will always be people who will notice that there's something different about you. Some kind of inner peace you seem to have, some source of comfort.   The Mission  God has committed to us the ministry of reconciliation. This means that we have been given the priviledge to bring others back to God. We need to let them know that  God loves them, will forgive them, and will change them. . Take note that Paul does not say,  "OK,all those who feel they're  capable, who have the gift of speech, and who can call fire down from heaven, you guys go spread the news. You guys are the ambassadors."  This message is for  all of us.   Please don't take this lightly, don't brush it away. Being God's ambassadors isn't a choice.  There is simply no excuse for not doing it.  Don't say that you don't know how.    If your friends are going to hell, let them go with your hands still on their feet, pulling them away. Don't hand them over to Satan easily. Don't let they're eternal suffering be on your hands.   Don't let it come to the point that when you are standing before the Most High God, you wish that you'd told your friends about the King. Because then it'll be too late.

        Matthew 6   Treasures in Heaven   19"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 20But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.  22"The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light. 23But if your eyes are bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!  24"No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.    I often wonder if I really mean what I say when I say "I'm not controlled by money or possesions". Could I, if I had to, give all my CDs up (Mineral, Jawbreaker, The Ataris, Jimmy Eat World...)? Could I give up my guitar for a greater cause? What about my SLR Camera? Would I give up all the money I had if God asked me to?  To put things in perspective, I often have to ask myself what happens in the end. I could listen to my impeccable CD collection everyday until I die, but I'd still die eventually. I could, and probably will end up playing my guitar everyday until I'm dead, but what then? My Epiphone Les Paul will remain here when I'm gone. Could I take photographs in heaven? If I accumulated wealth on earth, what good would it do me when I'm no longer alive?  It's not a bad thing owning stuff like that. Sometimes it can be rather useful: I could use my guitar to play in church, more money would make it easier to help those in financial difficulty. The danger comes when we become servants to what we own, when they begin to own us. Does my guitar take priority over God? Sometimes it might be the case, if I miss church to play in a rock gig. If I neglect my quiet time because I spend all my time listening to my CD's, they're definitely detrimental to my relationship with God.  If we focus on God at all times, we'll see that our belongings are just that. Just a few worldly and temporary distractions from the hassle of everyday life. In verse 24, Jesus says we "cannot serve both God and Money". God and money: pick one. It's so important to serve God, because then we'll know what's really important while being able to also enjoy possesions for what they are and no more. We'll dies eventually, so we should set our sights on eternity.  Nothing really matters when we're gone. If we keep this in mind, we'll see that God and eternity is what we should focus on.

        Luke 23   32Two other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be executed. 33When they came to the place called the Skull, there they crucified him, along with the criminals--one on his right, the other on his left. 34Jesus said,  "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." [1] And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.  35The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him. They said,  "He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One."   36The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar 37and said, "If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself."  38There was a written notice above him, which read:|sc THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.  39One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: "Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us!"  40But the other criminal rebuked him.  "Don't you fear God," he said, "since you are under the same sentence? 41We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong."  42Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.[2] "  43Jesus answered him, "I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise."    Footnotes 23:34 Some early manuscripts do not have this sentence. 23:42 Some manuscripts come with your kingly power    When i read this passage, i felt afraid to write about it here, because there are so many important things that you can get from it that i was afraid i'd mess up somewhere. This passage is about the one pivotal moment of the whole history of mankind, the piece that holds the whole Christian faith together. It is about the hour that Jesus died for us, when all heaven shook and when the victory was won.  I could write about many,many things from this passage alone, but i want to focus on Jesus' love. This passage is so beautiful, heart-breaking, if you read it through and try to be there.  Many have debated on who caused Jesus' death. Some say it was Judas, the Betrayer. Some say it was the rulers, who plotted against Him. Still others accuse Pilate, who could have stopped it from happening. You know who really caused Jesus death?  You and I.  Our sins is why Jesus died for us. He died to save us.  It is our voices which mocked Jesus when He was on the cross. It was  us  who laughed at Him, and spat at Him, and jeered at Him. In fact, we still mock Him now, whenever we sin, because we are making a mockery of His sacrifice.  Every time you sin knowingly, you're taking advantage of His love. Every time you say sorry and commit it again, you are taking His mercy for granted. Think about it.  Where's the beauty in all this?   34Jesus said,  "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."   I like to imagine that i'm that criminal. I guess you could say we all are. That criminal who hung on a cross next to Jesus. Someone who spent his life in devilry,sin,anger,hurt,shame,guilt,brokenness,poverty. Someone doomed to die the most painful death of his time, someone who had nothing left to live for. He was in pain, he had no hope. Why should he hope?  No one ever loved him anyway.    There must have been something about Jesus , even when He was covered in dried blood, open wounds, with a crown of thorns on His head. There must have been something about Him that told so strongly of love, hope, everything good, that made that criminal say about Him,  41We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong."  It's crazy, isn't it? How could this man have known that Jesus was innocent? It was this man,this criminal whom Jesus took to paradise. It was this uneducated, unclean, doomed-to-hell man who understood what Jesus came for. Not the learned synagogue rulers, not crowds He healed, nor the 12 disciples who only truly believed later.   If even this man could turn to Jesus and say,  "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.(v42)" , what about us?   Think that you are much better off than that man? Of course you are. You have a family,friends who love you, you have money,food, or whatever else you're blessed with. Yet are you really, though? Dont you have some sin, some weakness that gets you down, when no one else is looking?   You've been hurt before. I know you have, though i may not know when and where. You've been broken before. I know you have, though i don't know who broke you. But Jesus knows. Turn to Him, because He loves you so much He died for you. No sin is to big for Him to forgive.    "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,[1] that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.

       Proverbs 17  17 A friend loves at all times,  and a brother is born for adversity.   18 A man lacking in judgment strikes hands in pledge  and puts up security for his neighbor.   19 He who loves a quarrel loves sin;  he who builds a high gate invites destruction.   20 A man of perverse heart does not prosper;  he whose tongue is deceitful falls into trouble.   21 To have a fool for a son brings grief;  there is no joy for the father of a fool.   22 A cheerful heart is good medicine,  but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.    When was the last time you had a good laugh? Was it after hearing a joke? Was it with friends in the midst of having a good time? There's no denying the wonderful effect laughing has on us.  Proverbs is a book full of 'advice column' advice, but from a heavenly source. Verse 22 tells us "a cheerful heart is good medicine..." which basically means being happy is good for us.   Laughing and being joyful is such a great alternative to feeling down. As Christians, we have even more reason to be happy. God has blessed us with so much we shouldn't allow trivial things to get in the way of our happiness.  Finally, a passage from the bible without hidden meanings! Laugh, laugh, and laugh some more! Be happy, it's good for you.  Your friend, Kevin

        Proverbs 3    Further Benefits of Wisdom   1 My son, do not forget my teaching,  but keep my commands in your heart,  2 for they will prolong your life many years  and bring you prosperity.   3 Let love and faithfulness never leave you;  bind them around your neck,  write them on the tablet of your heart.  4 Then you will win favor and a good name  in the sight of God and man.    5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart  and lean not on your own understanding;  6 in all your ways acknowledge him,  and he will make your paths straight. [1]     Footnotes  3:6 Or will direct your paths   It's amazing how God gives me passages that can speak right to my heart. This passage starts off by stressing how important it is to keep God's Word in your heart. You know what i love so much about the Bible? It's how i can know, really  know  that this is God's advice for sure. It's the feeling of assurance that whenever i make choices that are Bible-founded i can  never  go wrong. You know those " Dear Thelma " advice columns in the Star? The advice she gives is not fool-proof. There's a big chance that following her advice will further mess up your life.   There's no gurantee.  You know what I'm saying?  Incredibly, this is one passage I could really use right now. Sometimes i feel the pressure to do well, to  please everyone ; sometimes i get so lost in choices, decisions that i have to make that could change everything." 3 Let love and faithfulness never leave you... 4 Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man.  " Can you imagine the confidence it gives me, knowing that if i have love, and faithfulness in my heart, i will win favor from man, and (most importantly) God ?  Verses 5 and 6. One of my favourite verses in the Bible. I really like this one, because it speaks of  hope . Ever felt so vulnerable to hurt, felt like you were standing on the edge of a slippery precipice, just about to fall off?  It's crazy, that feeling. Especially on off days, when everything just seems to be going wrong. On those days, remember that God is with you, and that He loves you.   On those days,  5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart  and lean not on your own understanding;  6 in all your ways acknowledge him,  and he will make your paths straight.

        1 Peter 1   Praise to God for a Living Hope   3Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 4and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade--kept in heaven for you, 5who through faith are shielded by God's power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time. 6In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials. 7These have come so that your faith--of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire--may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed. 8Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy, 9for you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls.     Quickly, think of the top five things you hate about life on earth. I'm sure you could think of many more. Sometimes I wonder if it's all worth it, going through this life. Is it worth putting up with people who stab us in the back? People who spread rumours about us? Is it worth going to school to study things that we may never need in our lifetimes?  Injustices abound in our world. But we go through them because there's something worthwhile at the end of it. The same reason we endure studying, so we can experience the joy of doing well on an exam. The same reason bands practice (and quarrel), so they can have their moment on stage to rock.  1 Peter 1 tells us of a great destination for which we are headed after surviving this world. Being a Christian doesn't guarantee an easy life on earth. We go through misery, depression, pain, heartbreak, rejection, loss, and countless other tragedies that befall the human race. We're different from everyone else because God has something special in store for us at the end of it all.  Maybe the world is the way it is so we don't get to attached to it. There's no reason to remain attached to it when we can rest assured there's something greater in store for us. Nothing we're going through now will matter when we've gone to heaven. Heaven is what keeps us pressing on. It's worth it, for what we'll experience there will more than make up for all that we have to put up with here.  Quickly, what are the top five things you're looking forward to in heaven?  Your friend, Kevin

        Joshua 6  1 Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the Israelites. No one went out and no one came in. 2 Then the LORD said to Joshua, "See, I have delivered Jericho into your hands, along with its king and its fighting men. 3 March around the city once with all the armed men. Do this for six days. 4 Have seven priests carry trumpets of rams' horns in front of the ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times, with the priests blowing the trumpets. 5 When you hear them sound a long blast on the trumpets, have all the people give a loud shout; then the wall of the city will collapse and the people will go up, every man straight in."   20 When the trumpets sounded, the people shouted, and at the sound of the trumpet, when the people gave a loud shout, the wall collapsed; so every man charged straight in, and they took the city.    Without knowing the bible existed, would you believe things like the fall of the walls of Jericho? Sure, we believe it because we know the bible is inspired by God. 2 Timothy 3:16 says "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness". So basically, when we hear unlogical and preposterous things like the parting of the Red Sea, we can accept it knowing it's from God. However, that's not all. There's been evidence of the fall of the wall of Jericho (check out  urlLink http://www.christiananswers.net/ ). The bible is rooted deeply in history, and is made out of solid verifiable facts. It's not simply a fairytle, it's exactly what happened thousands of years ago. Because of this, there's more for us to follow than just blind faith in the bible, because we know it to be true. The bible is by far thew most interesting history text book of all time.  Your friend, Kevin*

          Genesis 27      35 But he said, "Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing." 36 Esau said, "Isn't he rightly named Jacob [1] ? He has deceived me these two times: He took my birthright, and now he's taken my blessing!" Then he asked, "Haven't you reserved any blessing for me?" 37 Isaac answered Esau, "I have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. So what can I possibly do for you, my son?" 38 Esau said to his father,  "Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!"  Then Esau wept aloud. 39 His father Isaac answered him, "Your dwelling will be away from the earth's richness, away from the dew of heaven above. 40 You will live by the sword and you will serve your brother. But when you grow restless, you will throw his yoke from off your neck."  Jacob Flees to Laban  41 Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. He said to himself, "The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob."       AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!! My brother Jacob is such a pain! That TWIT! Mother's boy. I should have known he and Mom were plotting against me! She's  always  sided with him. He takes my birthright for a bowl of soup, and now he steals my blessings. It isn't fair! -Esau- No, Esau didn't say that. I was making that up. Still, I imagine that's what it felt like, only a thousand times worse. If you ask me, Jacob deserves to be tied up and thrown into a lake of dung beetles, or something. Esau was the elder brother, and had the right to his father's land, servants, wealth and blessings. If you don't know the story, here's how it goes: [If you do, just skip the passage]       Jacob Gets Isaac's Blessing      1 When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see, he called for Esau his older son and said to him, "My son." "Here I am," he answered. 2 Isaac said, "I am now an old man and don't know the day of my death. 3 Now then, get your weapons-your quiver and bow-and go out to the open country to hunt some wild game for me. 4 Prepare me the kind of tasty food I like and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my blessing before I die." 5 Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau left for the open country to hunt game and bring it back, 6 Rebekah said to her son Jacob, "Look, I overheard your father say to your brother Esau, 7 'Bring me some game and prepare me some tasty food to eat, so that I may give you my blessing in the presence of the LORD before I die.' 8 Now, my son, listen carefully and do what I tell you: 9 Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, so I can prepare some tasty food for your father, just the way he likes it. 10 Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may give you his blessing before he dies." 11 Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, "But my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I'm a man with smooth skin. 12 What if my father touches me? I would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself rather than a blessing." 13 His mother said to him, "My son, let the curse fall on me. Just do what I say; go and get them for me." 14 So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared some tasty food, just the way his father liked it. 15 Then Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob. 16 She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goatskins. 17 Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made. 18 He went to his father and said, "My father." "Yes, my son," he answered. "Who is it?" 19 Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game so that you may give me your blessing." 20 Isaac asked his son, "How did you find it so quickly, my son?" "The LORD your God gave me success," he replied. 21 Then Isaac said to Jacob, "Come near so I can touch you, my son, to know whether you really are my son Esau or not." 22 Jacob went close to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, "The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau." 23 He did not recognize him, for his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he blessed him. 24 "Are you really my son Esau?" he asked. "I am," he replied. 25 Then he said, "My son, bring me some of your game to eat, so that I may give you my blessing." Jacob brought it to him and he ate; and he brought some wine and he drank. 26 Then his father Isaac said to him, "Come here, my son, and kiss me." 27 So he went to him and kissed him. When Isaac caught the smell of his clothes, he blessed him and said,...       Ever been so angry at someone you could just  kill  her?[him?] I have sooo been there. God is unfathomable sometimes. Really, He works in twisted, absurd ways that no one in his human mind could comprehend. Reading about Esau and Jacob, you'd think that Jacob would get punished later on in the story, right? Just like you can't help wishing that your enemies would get trodden by a God-sent elephant. Well  *ding!*  Guess what? Jacob was the one who lived happily ever after. Jacob was the one who saw a vision of angels in heaven. Jacob married Rebecca. (admittedly, he earned it).  Jacob had the honour of being Jesus' great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather.      Instead of using Esau who was wronged to beget the world's Saviour, God used Jacob, the deceiver. As much as we don't want to look at the possibilty that God might have awesome plans for our enemies, it's there. In the end, Esau forgave Jacob, and hugged him at the end of this tale. After many years, but still! And we should forgive too, because if Jesus died for the forgiveness of our sins, we should forgive others when they wrong us.     It may be crazy talk, offering your other cheek when you're slapped, but hey, that's what God says.     Signing off,     Jenna

        Matthew 5  Love for Enemies  43"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' 44But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. 46If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? 47And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? 48Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.    The teachings of Jesus sometimes seem inapplicable in the world we live in. We know His teachings are certainly right, but in this day and age they sometimes seem unpractical and occasionaly, even crazy. Seriously, how much sense does it make to love those who hate you? It doesn't seem logical to ask God to bless the people who talk bad about you, hurt you, and walk all over you.       But have you ever thought about how love can diffuse a situation? When being shouted at, your enemy expects you to fight back (and has probably thought of a reply to what he thinks you're going to say). What do you think would happen if you showed love to someone who was antagonizing you? Imagine hugging the person shouting at you, he'd be at a lost for words and you'd effectively win the argument, or at least diffuse it.      Verse 45 tells us why we should follow Jesus' teachings. It's for a higher purpose, so we can be called God's children. People on earth may laugh and wonder why we act the way we do, but the bottomline is Jesus has instructed us to do it.      We're called to love everyone, but the passage talks specifically about loving your enemies. It's so easy to love the person who bought you the Belle & Sebastian album you've been looking for for months, but how easy is it to love the person who borrowed and lost it? Anyone can love someone who loves them in return (we should still do this of course), but Jesus' special instructions involve loving the unlovable.      Of all the things on earth, love is surely the most powerful. It's what (in theory) distinguishes Christians, and it's what we should always use on others. In tense situations, if you don't love, anything else you do has the potential to blow up in your face.      Your friend,   Kevin

          Job 9      1 Then Job replied:    2 "Indeed, I know that this is true. But how can a mortal be righteous before God?    3 Though one wished to dispute with him, he could not answer him one time out of a thousand.    4 His wisdom is profound, his power is vast. Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?    5 He moves mountains without their knowing it and overturns them in his anger.    6 He shakes the earth from its place and makes its pillars tremble.     7 He speaks to the sun and it does not shine; he seals off the light of the stars.    8 He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.    9 He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.    10 He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted."         When I get depressed with the state of the world, I find the best thing to do is to take a good look around. In the simple things, you can often find joy in recognizing God's miracles. My all-time top five simple wonders that remind me of God:     Seeing the sunset in the distance, usually when it's spectacularly orange.    Being caught in the rain. It's when I can  feel  things I'm not usually able to.    Stars at night, even if some of them are satellites.    Dolphins. Never seen one in real life, only on the Discovery Channel.    The smile on the face of a friend when his/her day has suddenly become fine.     There's so many things that we should be able to smile about knowing that it's one of God's miracles. Someimes, we end to over-analyze things. I sometimes find thinking of a sunset as a loss of sight of a burning ball of gas caused by the spinning of the earth takes the wonder out of it.    Look around, and cheer up. Knowing God has to be a good thing if He can perform so many wonderful miracles.    Your friend,    Kevin

        Philippians 2   Imitating Christ's Humility   1If you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, 2then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and purpose. 3Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves.  4Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.   5Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus:       6Who, being in very nature[1] God,         did not consider equality with God something to be grasped,      7but made himself nothing,         taking the very nature[2] of a servant,          being made in human likeness.      8And being found in appearance as a man,         he humbled himself         and became obedient to death--            even death on a cross!      9Therefore God exalted him to the highest place         and gave him the name that is above every name,      10that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,         in heaven and on earth and under the earth,      11and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,         to the glory of God the Father.   Footnotes 2:6 Or in the form of  2:7 Or the form     Jesus told his disciples that whoever wants to be the greatest must be the least.Jesus, King of Kings, was the greatast servant of all. Being a servant isn't any fun, most of the time. It can be boring, it can seem like a waste of time, serving others can be a pain in the neck. Weeding the garden for your mom, hanging up the clothes,doing paperwork for teachers...all the really boring stuff. That's serving.  The only way to keep on going, keep on serving is to look to Jesus.( Just like every other hard thing the Bible says to do, looking to Jesus is the best way because He's  done  all that) Isn't it true that Jesus, being in the very natuer of   God   took on the very nature of a servant? Kewl, huh?  Sometimes being Christian just isn't fun. You have to do a whole bunch of stuff you don't want to. But God is a good God. There  are  a lot of perks to following Jesus.Such as, you know, eternal life, living water, peace that transcends all understanding, power to cast out demons, love that overflows...   Love the Lord your God with all your heart,and all your soul, and all your might. Love your neighbour as you love yourself.   Signing off, Jenna

       2 Timothy 1  1Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus, 2To Timothy, my dear son: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. Encouragement to Be Faithful 3I thank God, whom I serve, as my forefathers did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers. 4Recalling your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy. 5I have been reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also. 6For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands. 7For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and of self-discipline.  2 Timothy 2  1You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 2And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others.   When you think about it, how do Christians come about? I mean, they don't just simply 'exist', they surely had to have gone through a process of becoming a Christian. So then, how are Christians made? Obviously, God makes Christians. What I mean is, the final decision of someone to be a true Christian comes from God's conviction. Of course, there's still free choice for everyone when it comes to this. But there are other things that help bring people to know Christ.  Some people are born into a Christian family and believing for them is a gradual process. Some people come to know Christ through a dramatic chain of events. Either way, there's always other people involved in someone's Christian journey.  In 2 Timothy, it's clear that Timothy was helped along in his faith by his mother, grandmother, and even Paul. Many people come to know God through the efforts of parents, friends, pastors,  and anyone God can make use of. For a person born into a Christian family, his parents play an important role from a young age. A non-believer may be brought to Christ through the words and actions of a close friend.  I'm certain we can identify people who have helped us along in our walk with God. Everyone knows these people, so it's obvious that we should be these people as well. As Christians, we're in a position to help so many others know the God whom we believe in. When we see how much of our faith is due to people who have helped us, we should feel the urge to help others in the same way.  Your friend, Kevin

        Deuteronomy 32  44 Moses came with Joshua son of Nun and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people. 45 When Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel, 46 he said to them, "Take to heart all the words I have solemnly declared to you this day, so that you may command your children to obey carefully all the words of this law. 47 They are not just idle words for you-they are your life. By them you will live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess."  48 On that same day the LORD told Moses, 49 "Go up into the Abarim Range to Mount Nebo in Moab, across from Jericho, and view Canaan, the land I am giving the Israelites as their own possession. 50 There on the mountain that you have climbed you will die and be gathered to your people, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people. 51 This is because both of you broke faith with me in the presence of the Israelites at the waters of Meribah Kadesh in the Desert of Zin and because you did not uphold my holiness among the Israelites. 52 Therefore, you will see the land only from a distance; you will not enter the land I am giving to the people of Israel."    I turned seventeen yesterday. For the past week, I've been going through a 'mid-life' crisis, feeling so lost. I've never felt so old and so young at the same time. You see, I was sixteen last year, which means I'm now past the midway point of my teenage years (you do the math). At the same time, it was only seven years ago that I was ten. I expected that with growing older, I'd actually feel grown up.      As it turned out, God has blessed me tremendously. On my birthday, things happened which enabled me to look past all my fears and insecurities, and see that I have so much in my life. After thinking about things for awhile, it's easy to see that when everything seems to fall apart God is still looking out for us, all the while knowing how much we can take.      When God told Moses he was going to die (imagine being told something like that and knowing it would happen), Moses still praised God until the day he died. It can become so easy to think it's all going downhill as we edge closer to death. Though for us, it's normally ageing and nothing as dramatic as an anouncement of death. It should be equally easy to look at the future positively.      Ever read the book 'Tuesdays with Morrie'? It's about this professor who suffers from an illness and is going to die. Before he dies, he imparts life's lessons to one of his former students. This book has gained loads of praise for the way it faces death. Personally, I think the book presents a misguided view of death. The dying man doesn't know God, so while he talks very sensibly about how we should live life, it's still not enough. There's no hope in facing death without God no matter how smart we are.      The future is an uncertain thing that scares me to death. The only way to face growing old is with faith in God. In the past week, I've learned you can't stop growing old. What you can do (with eyes firmly on God and people you love around you), is age gracefully.      Your friend,   Kevin

        Daniel 4    The Dream Is Fulfilled   28 All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar. 29 Twelve months later, as the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon, 30 he said, "Is not this the great Babylon I have built as the royal residence, by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty?"  31 The words were still on his lips when a voice came from heaven, "This is what is decreed for you, King Nebuchadnezzar:  Your royal authority has been taken from you.  32 You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like cattle. Seven times will pass by for you until you  acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes."   33 Immediately what had been said about Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven away from people and ate grass like cattle. His body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his nails like the claws of a bird.   34 At the end of that time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven, and my sanity was restored. Then I praised the Most High; I honored and glorified him who lives forever.   His dominion is an eternal dominion;  his kingdom endures from generation to generation.  35 All the peoples of the earth  are regarded as nothing.  He does as he pleases  with the powers of heaven  and the peoples of the earth.   No one can hold back his hand  or say to him: "What have you done?"    36 At the same time that my sanity was restored, my honor and splendor were returned to me for the glory of my kingdom. My advisers and nobles sought me out, and I was restored to my throne and became even greater than before. 37 Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven, because everything he does is right and all his ways are just.  And those who walk in pride he is able to humble.    This passage reminds us that God is King over all the earth, and that no one has the right to question His decisions. He is the one calling the shots. King Nebuchednezzar forgot that. He proudly said that Babylon was for the glory of his majesty, forgetting that God made all the people in it, as well as brought Nebuchednezzar to be King in the first place.  God was angry with Nebby's pride, and what Nebby suffered next just about proves that God can give, and He can also take back. The message is clear : Let all that we do, all that we accomplish bring glory to God, and not to ourselves.  Easier said than done? Signing off, Jenna

         Hebrews 12      7Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as sons. For what son is not disciplined by his father? 8If you are not disciplined (and everyone undergoes discipline), then you are illegitimate children and not true sons. 9Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of our spirits and live! 10Our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, that we may share in his holiness. 11No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.         Sometimes it seems like we've been forsaken by God. When times are tough on us, we tend to lose sight of it all. The world caves in, we lose friends, and it seems like God is a cruel kid on an anthill burning us with a huge magnifying glass.      There's no escaping pain in our life. Almost daily we experience misery, loss, rejection, pain, and suffering in various forms and degrees. What we often fail to see is that these experiences are proof of God's love for us. When it all falls apart, we can rest assured that at the very least God has not forsaken us.      Only through hardships can we develop into better people. God knows this, and doing His duty as a loving father, he ensures that we experience hardships so that we may grow to be more like Him.       The tough part is often continuing to trust in God while we are down, especially since He's in control. We have to remember that it's for our own good, and He's doing this because He loves us very, very much. Lord, get me through this.      Your friend,   Kevin

          Jeremiah 18    At the Potter's House  1The LORD gave another message to Jeremiah. He said, 2"Go down to the shop where clay pots and jars are made. I will speak to you while you are there." 3So I did as he told me and found the potter working at his wheel.  4But the jar he was making did not turn out as he had hoped, so the potter squashed the jar into a lump of clay and started again.  5Then the LORD gave me this message: 6"O Israel, can I not do to you as this potter has done to his clay? As the clay is in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand. 7If I announce that a certain nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down, and destroyed, 8but then that nation renounces its evil ways, I will not destroy it as I had planned. 9And if I announce that I will build up and plant a certain nation or kingdom, making it strong and great, 10but then that nation turns to evil and refuses to obey me, I will not bless that nation as I had said I would. 11"Therefore, Jeremiah, go and warn all Judah and Jerusalem. Say to them, `This is what the LORD says: I am planning disaster against you instead of good. So turn from your evil ways, each of you, and do what is right.' " 12But they replied,  "Don't waste your breath. We will continue to live as we want to, following our own evil desires."     God is the potter, and we are the clay. I'm going to lift this off Ps Palan's message to my youth on saturday :)  We are clay in God's hands. Does the clay tell the potter what shape to mold it into? No, the potter molds the clay exactly as He pleases. The potter knows what shape is best for the clay to be made into, because He knows the texture and type of clay and everything. Sometimes we tell the potter "Make me into this, or make me into that!" If the clay bothers the potter like that, it will only prolong the process.  God is like the potter in the passage. If we are marred, He will squash us up, and start again. A vessel/pot/vase is never made perfect in the first round of molding. The potter has to mold the clay, remove the flecks of dust and small little rocks, squash the clay, and start all over again. Each time, the shape will be better than the last. It's the same with us, really. It's a painful process, being squished and remolded, but in the end it's all worth it.  Here in this passage God also gives us a warning: The way we live can change His mind about the plans that He has in store for us.  Of course God has great plans for you. Of course He wants you to be beautiful like Jesus, and have good success and everything. But we can make God angry, and the worst thing that can happen to any Christian is have God turn away from us.  God is merciful, and He gives us chances. But there's a limit to everything. The best the clay can do is  be still  and let God do the painful squishing process.   (v11) 'This is what the LORD says: I am planning disaster against you instead of good. So turn from your evil ways, each of you, and do what is right.' "   Signing off, Jenna p.s. sorry about missing the Friday's post; I couldn't access the net (>.
