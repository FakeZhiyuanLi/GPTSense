       We all have them. For some people, they're innocuous, like still enjoying the musical styling of the Backstreet Boys or sneaking a pint of Haagen-Dazs. For me, my weakness is TV. I love TV. Almost as much as I love booze. And no show was more important to me than Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It had it all, comedy, drama, action, hot babes, supernatural creatures. I even enjoyed its spin-off, Angel. Now they are both off the air. So what am I to do? Watch Fox's The O.C. of course!  The O.C. for those of you not in the know is Fox's hit teen drama, airing this fall on Thursday evenings at 9 PM.&nbsp;It is a story of fathers and sons, husbands and wives and the relationships between a group of teens in Southern California. Newport Beach, Orange County is an idyllic paradise: a wealthy, harbor front community where everything and everyone appears to be perfect. But beneath the surface is a world of shifting loyalties and identities, of kids living secret lives hidden from their parents and of parents living secret lives hidden from their children.&nbsp;Ryan Atwood&nbsp;(Benjamin McKenzie), a troubled teen from the wrong side of the tracks, is thrust into this world when Sandy Cohen (Peter Gallagher), an idealistic pro-bono public defender, invites him to stay in his guesthouse. Ryan soon learns that nothing is what it seems, and his arrival serves as the catalyst for forging new alliances, rekindling old flames and striking unlikely friendships. Sandy's wife,&nbsp;Kirsten (Kelly Rowan), a wealthy and beautiful former homecoming queen and the perfect spouse, mother and businesswoman, isn't happy that Ryan has moved in. And she's worried about how the change will affect her and Sandy's teenage son,&nbsp;Seth (Adam Brody), a soulful dreamer ostracized by his peers. Meanwhile, Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton), the heartbreakingly beautiful girl next door, seems to glide through life effortlessly, that is, until the indiscretions of her wealthy father, Jimmy (Tate Donovan) threaten to break her world apart.  Hooked yet? How could you not be? Anyway, my dilemma is that the damn show is on hiatus until Nov.4th!!! What the hell am I supposed to watch in the interim? Since it's summer, I guess I will have to settle with the blockbuster movies and sports to watch. And of course summer means heat which leads to more booze.  Once again, booze is the cause of and solution to all of life's problems.  Hooray Beer!   urlLink http://www.redstripebeer.com  &nbsp;

      So, you think you're favorite movie is great. I'm sure it is. But it is not the greatest ever. No no my friend. That title can only be held by one film and it is Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle!!!   Now I know what you're thinking. How does a small budget American Pie meets Half Baked stoner flick even fall into the category of greatest film ever? Simply put, cause I said so. But allow me to elaborate on that winning contention.   This film has all the proper elements of all films in one. It has drama, comedy, suspense, action and that's just the opening scenes! It's a tale of two young men who take different approaches to life.&nbsp;Harold(John Cho)&nbsp;is the quintessential Asian-American, works hard, never talks back, and is always thinking of his future and how to achieve his goals. Kumar(Kal Penn), on the other hand is aloof, laid back and takes life no more seriously than an episode of the Simpsons. They do however share a common bond: they love to smoke pot. And this leads us directly to the main focus of this film, the munchies and the insatiable craving for a White Castle hamburger.   Now since the film opens this weekend, I won’t give away any spoilers for a while. But I will post some of the shining reviews of this film from critics around the nation. I urge you all to see this film with some friends, like I did. It will be an experience that bonds you for life, like when the older generation asks “Where were you when JFK was assassinated?”, but better.   Don’t forget to hit the White Castle after the movie for tie-in products and of course those steamed bits of heaven.

      It has become increasingly difficult for me to find a chick I like. Don't get me wrong, my penis has no problems finding hot women all around me, but a hot woman who I would have an actual interest in? Now that's hard.   So recently I've decided that maybe I should lower my standards a bit. My friends have deemed them to be a bit excessive at times, like when I find that a chick reading the NY Post to be beneath me. Or if she has ugly sneakers. I'm no prize myself but I always felt that it shouldn't matter. Just cause I'm not Brad Pitt it doesn't mean I have to settle.   but since it has been a while since I've had a date or even approached a chick it's about time I stopped making excuses and put my money where&nbsp;my mouth is. So for the next few months I will be making more of an effort to talk to some lovely ladies and try to dazzle them with my famous charm and renowned sense of humor. then I will report on the results here on a weekly basis.   Hopefully, I don't fall flat on my ass. But I'm preparing this weekend by watching my number 1 favorite movie, Swingers, to help inspire and guide me on this quest. That and a shit load of JD and Coke.   Wish me luck. And for God's sake if you see a brotha crashin' and burnin', be a good wingman and save me.   Remember, a good friend takes one for the team.

      I love scotch. Scotchy scotch scotch.  &nbsp;  These are the words of Ron Burgundy, legendary anchorman of the late 1970s. And they still resonate with us today. As an avid admirer of fine spirits and ales, I have been known to extol the virtue of imbibing adult beverages.  &nbsp;  Sadly, earlier this month, Delaware the stalwart holdout of our union, finally caved into pressure from the "man" and lower its legal bac count to 0.8. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a 170-pound man would need to consume four drinks in one hour to reach the .08 limit. A 137-pound woman would reach the same level of intoxication after three drinks in one hour. And I would need like 10 shots and a six pack to start feeling a good buzz. Drinking is relative and the government should take this into consideration. After all, some of the greatest novelists wrote better drunk. Just cause one guy crashes an Exxon oil tanker, must we all pay the price?  &nbsp;  We must stop the government from decreasing our daily intake of liquor in an veiled effort to decrease drunk driving mortality. After all, I&nbsp;myself am&nbsp;adamantly against drinking and driving, cause it is quite possible that you could spill your drink. But have I killed anybody while driving drunk? No. So just to be cautious, pull over to the side of the road, have a stiff one and continue on your way.  &nbsp;  Together, we can make America safer.

      Man, what a sorry state the world of music is in. There's such a vast collection of crap out there. And you can't help but hear it everywhere you go. Thanks to MTV, and it's undying desire for the almighty dollar, the airwaves are rife with garbage.  As a New Yorker, our city has been the birthplace of some of the greatest artists and musical movements in my generation and throughout history. Just let me "drop some knowledge" on you. Tupac, Biggie, Run DMC, LL Cool J. All New Yorkers. The Ramones, Blondie, Billy Joel, Charlie Parker, Benny Goodman. All homegrown. Rap was born in New York, jazz too. Mainstream punk exploded in New York. New Yorkers know good music when they hear it. And I for one find the imbalance in today's music of good vs. crap frightening.  Don't get me wrong there are plenty of commercial success stories out there today. But how many of them make their own music? Are not just marketing machines? Very few. Today it's all about the image you present. Look at the Britneys, Puffys, and J-los. None of them have real talent. They are just good at looking pretty, or riding someone else's coattails.  I'm a music lover, of all genres. But I find myself leaving the mainstream more and more, trying to find artist that speak from the heart, who pour their souls into their music. And what saddens yet inspires me is that very few of people will ever see the kind of fortunes that the megastar are undeservedly receiving.  Don't get me wrong. They are plenty of mainstream acts I enjoy. But not because of the hype, but because their music speaks to me and resonates in my world. I like guys like Staind, Incubus, female acts like Sarah Mac Lachlan and Avril, and even rappers like Nas. But they are few and far between.  Let me know what your thoughts are on this subject. I am being pompous or do you agree with my sentiment?

      As all guys know from their dads, you never buy a car without test driving it first. Why is it then that these ignorant, bible thumping kids pledge to remain abstinent until marriage? I mean we all know that a good percentage of them are lying through their teeth. The others are divorces waiting to happen. I'm by no means advocating that these boys and girls become "sluts" or "playas" (not that there's anything wrong with that. I for one loooove sluts). But at the same thing, a large part of love and marriage is sexual compatibility. I mean you may find out afterwards that you do not share the same sexual peccadilloes as your spouse.  Take the case of Jack Ryan, senatorial candidate from Illinois and his former wife, Star Trek vixen Jeri Ryan. Things are great, he's so loving and stable. They get married and holy shit, he's a freak. He wants to go to sex clubs, is an exhibitionist, etc. Wouldn’t you want to know about this before hand.  Take this hypothetical situation for example. You have the love of your life, your high school sweetheart, You date for years, share the occasional make out and heavy petting. Then you get married. And that night, on your honeymoon, the sex was just blah. Nothing to write home about. She doesn’t like giving head, or he has no technique. Whatever the problem is, you just bought a lemon so to speak. Now you have to pay more money than it cost to get married to get divorced. Plus, there's the social stigma attached to divorce to contend with. how will your family and friends react? Co-workers? And the clergy at your house of worship? (I worship myself, so I'd be forgiven)  This leads me to believe that the only answer is to get on my soapbox and advocate pre-marital relations. Young men and women of America, it's time to get out there and take what's yours. The time is ripe for a second sexual revolution and I'm the first to join. Follow me and you never need your hand (or "back massager") again!

      So I finally put up and shut up. This past weekend, I paid for a ticket to see Michael Moore's new documentary Fahrenheit 9/11. In the past I never gave a rat's ass when it came to politics. I always figured I could just move to Canada, like every other well educated, liberal American. But these past few years have awakened my patriotism. Not because I hate al-Qaida (I do), or because this country is the best in the world (it isn't), but because we have freedoms. And this is the most important element in Moore's film. The framers gave us freedom of speech, freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, et al. And I for one am longer taking this for granted.  It's not just that Fahrenheit 9/11 exposes Bush and his cronies for the corrupt morons that they are, it's that Moore has the freedom to do so. Agree with the man or not, your choice. But respect his right to speak his mind. Imagine if the shoe was on the other foot and the conservatives were being stifled by the Democrats. There would be no Fox News Channel, no New York Post and certainly no NRA. America is a land where dissenting opinions are not only allowed, but encouraged. We must allow understand and appreciate this.   If not for these freedoms, there would still be slavery. There would be a national religion, and most frightening there would be unending censorship of the general populace. Whether you these freedom for granted or use them intelligently, it matters not. You can sleep sound at night just knowing that they are always there when you need them. No Gestapo is coming to take you away, no Red Army is destroying your house of worship. And that is liberating beyond belief.  As for Bush and his buddies, I haven't seen a larger group of self-righteous, ignorant, blatantly corrupt group of individuals amassed since the Reagan administration. (Zing!)Moore wants us to examine the current administration and all the grievous errors, devious liaisons, and unbelievable abuses of power that threaten the future of our great nation. He realizes that although there is no panacea for the American public, we can make a conscious effort to improve our nation starting with removing the Bushes from power. And the only way to do this is by educating ourselves and voting intelligently. I myself do not favor the lesser of two evils approach to voting, but sometimes sacrifices must be made for the greater good. And the greater good is a White House without a Bush (the rose bush can stay, I like flowers).  I won't go into specifics about the film, since I encourage everyone to see it for themselves. I especially would like to invite any Republicans to see the film, since even they, in my opinion, would be "shocked and awed" by the fallacious and deceitful nature of the Bush administration. If you have seen it or just think I'm a horses ass, post a comment and I will address it. See? Freedom of speech in action...  America is for everyone to share. But you have to actively participate before you can comment. Don't be left out. Speak your minds, get out the vote and show the world that we are proud to be American and all that it stands for.  Fret not, tomorrow I will return to what I am known for, being a Man's Man. And not in the gay way. Although there's not anything wrong with that...(if you can guess the reference there is a prize, pride in your ability to remember useless shit.)

      Welcome one and all to the new and improved home of In Hutch We Trust, where ideas flow like beer from the tap. For all of you who are new to the blog, I thank you for stopping by. It's nice to know that there are 3 people are there who care. This blog will cover all aspects of my life, from my political ideals, religious beliefs, my undying love for alcoholic beverages and above all my zeal for hot women in tight clothing. Sure, this may sound pedestrian and even vulgar, but thanks to some old dudes back in the 18th Century (or 17th Century, I always forget how it works), we have freedom of expression. But since mine is the only one that counts, just shut the hell up and let me say my peace. Everyday will be a new adventure, a journey into the complex pysche of Me. So sit back, buckle up, strap in and pray to god cause it gets a bit bumpy from here on out.

      So yesterday I was thinking to myself about how I used to have a lot more friends than I do know. I thought that maybe I'm depressed and need to get out more. But then it hit me. Maybe I was too dependent on those around me, for some sort of social validation. I wasn't always like that. I grew up an only child. I spent a lot of time alone. Even when I lived in the black hole known as Virginia, I pretty much just kept to myself. Why this sudden need to be surround by others? No clue. So I've decided to conduct a social experiment. I'm not gonna contact any of my friends (read: friend singular) for a few days. Can I live with not calling, not been called, not hanging out with others? I think I can. Then if it goes well, I might try it for a week, maybe more. Gradually, I'll start to cherish my alone time. I'll try to get some reading done. Listen to some music. And I am gonna limit my video game time to a max of 2 hours per day. Harsh, I know. But it's time I take back my life and rediscover who I really am and who I want to be. I'll be checking in after the weekend. Maybe this is just what I need to get me out of this funk I've been in the past months. Only time will tell.

       Ever have an epiphany? Well this past weekend I did. I finally woke up from my dream and realized I was an adult. Holy Shit! I wasn't a kid anymore. I mean 24 is still young, but it's past the point where you can make stupid mistakes and not worry about the consequences. I have responsibilities, work at a job I hate, and my idea of a good time is just getting the hell out of the house.  Not to wax nostalgic, but I miss the days of my youth. Granted they only passed a few years ago, but it's not the same now as it was then. I was carefree, drinking the night away and going to the construction site hung over. Now if I get a hangover, I have to stay home and sleep it off. I used to go out carousing with my friends, causing mischief on the streets of New York. Now I worry that people are looking at us and that a cop may stop us. Where has my sense of danger gone?  So, I've decided not to grow up after all. I'm gonna turn back the hands of time. I hereby promise not be an adult until I turn 30. I say that I have a few more years left and I'm gonna fill them up with all the debauchery one human being can handle. It's like a reawakening. And boy is it gonna be a blast!

      Man, I'm seriously getting into emo, short for emotional punk. It's mostly sad, depressing, whiny music from twenty-something year olds. And damn am I hooked. I had already liked a few tracks from a couple of bands, like Dashboard Confessional, Thursday, Jimmy Eat World. But recently I started burning some CDs at my friend Jose's house and I've been listening to them non stop. It's something about the guitar rhythms and lyrics that just gets me. Anyways, I'm going to the Vans Warped Tour for the first time this Sunday and I am psyched. It's mostly a pop punk, emo thing with skating thrown in for the mix. Think X Games with a concert. There's a ton of bands performing, like 50-70 bands. I'll report on how it was to keep you up to date.  Outside of that, my favorite hangout bar, Yer Man's Irish Pub has relocated to a new location and I am gonna check it out tonight. I'm not planning on getting drunk, since I do have to work tomorrow. But I am hoping there will be some chicks since it has been some time since I got any action as noted in earlier posts. I'll see how it goes, cause even if there are chicks I probably won't do a damn thing about it. Go figure.  Well, I have some "work" to take care of. So I'm gonna go.  Laters people!
