      Robert Mitchum Soaking Votka  Eulogy  Robert Mitchum, that is, on the 1 July has died at the age of 79, he was too much for this, the generation of Tutto-Cosa-In-Moderazione. He made what it wished to make when it has wished to make it. He lived hard. He played it hard. He drunk. It smoked him (the pulmonary cancer and of emphysema finally it has made it within him). His professional duties are to make us remember the carnivorousness of those we are and that the castle of Brussels is not what's for lunch.  Character  Mitchum is l'articolo genuine -- the hard type of Hollywood hard-boiledness; how much are these heroes that he has played?&nbsp; He has walked the walk, though unstable—he has hit the thin tracks like the ferret-faced sort.&nbsp; A kid of 14, who for two years more subsequently, hurts himself on a chain group in a Georgia prison. He is an indecisive! He is a boxer, a store clerk of the ice-skate and is even a poet.&nbsp; Mitchum options a play he wrote from the cooperative of a theatre and written oratory.&nbsp; In Hollywood Orson Welles will produce it and direct it internally,.  Legacy  He has become an actor.&nbsp; The course of a long career he completes.&nbsp; He has generated only extremely in style characters of the on-screen.&nbsp; He is successful in some way in just being; he is cold, hasty, laudable and vague-sinister, laconic to the inertia point. He is however, still an action man! Above all, he felt and was hard. The hard types of movie-today don’t even come near. Well, perhaps Michael Madsen, but first he must arrest the cops and leave the ears outside. As far as the others, close to Mitchum, Eastwood it seems is perplexed. Nolte seems pizzone-drunk! De Niro, Pacino and Keitel are kidskins that play the grown-ups! And as far as Willis and Stallone and Schwarzenegger, you can imagine Mitchum in a “Hollywood of the Planet” T-Shirt?!  Films  When the producers of the "Cape Them Originally Fear" tried to assume it, "I say to them that I'd proffered it if they’d obtained somebody elsewhere. Unfortunately, I demonstrate that I know more approximately how the behavior of the criminal works to them, nobody otherwise can obtain it. Then, those pits get consistent and the story is designated to be siphoned through a suck-hole. The treatment of data in Hollywood….(sarcasticm). It has to be us, we are to be heavy and a hero. Therefore, they make a hero from a bent lawyer that the God and store clerks know how many felonies they have…trifling!”;  &nbsp;The director Howard Hawks has telephoned for the role of forehead to be John Wayne in "El the Western Dorado." "'What's the story?’ I ask (deep-expressed impression to Hawks) for the history 'No, Bob. It's character foremost; I say 'Swell.' The Hawks, he has been consumed by a complete producer-director, it has an attitude of standing there on feet while in space. 'Don't they hinder it, ' people say of the writing of 'what’s in his head.' I have myself as a linguist for a day and I have interfered with it that its vigilance.&nbsp; It controls time and orders us to break."  Money vs. Artistic Integrity  &nbsp;  Mitchum always gets "those prices". "Somebody says, 'We really want you to do this script.' And I say, 'I'll need a horrendous lot of money in front to do that.' And it never seems to be a problem. The less I like a sad script, the higher my values. And they pay. They may recompense in yen, but they recompense, ya understand. There are movies I won't do for any amount. I turned down 'Patton' and I turned down 'Dirty Harry.' These are Movies that the world pisses on.&nbsp; If I've got $5 in my pocket then I'm no comprehensive whore, I don't need to make money fucking that way, daddy-o."  Death  The memory is to be based on sofas, and large rawboned Philip Marlowes.&nbsp; I come to life, saying, "I've called a cynical one, it sure can't be denied because Philip Marlowe is one cynical style-girl. I seem to believe that once determined amounts the cynicism are inherent to the beast. But there's romanticism, though small within here. It’s more than a little hedonism. You can use this in order to add it all on that: I know what you make of it, I'm bullshit. But I've obtained it and admit it, it's also a good ride for good ones." Continues Mitchum.  He once that said that he is drinking in preparation for the dead women. "When that great day comes, I will be completely injured by it.&nbsp; But It will hardly be new, once hungover.”

       “A guy can’t drink liquor all the time and study like I’m goin to” John Steinback, The Grapes of Wrath &nbsp;  Spring Poem&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;–definitions courtesy of “The American Heritage® Dictionary”  By C. Lester&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;--Slinky info from - http://www.slinkytoys.com/toys/history.asp  &nbsp;  Spring—What comes to mind?  Think damn you!!  A slinky…..?  A slinky isn’t really a spring though..  It’s the opposite--pulling itself in  instead of out  &nbsp;do springs always have to push outward?  What’s the definition of a spring anyway?  Dictionary?...yeah…that’s why they still make em….  can I be bothered….?  Screw it...... I shall sacrifice my time for art…  somebody better appreciate this……  &nbsp;  INTRANSITIVE VERB: 1. To move upward or forward in a single quick motion or a series of such motions; leap  &nbsp;  No slinkys (is that how you spell slinky?)  Slinkies—Slinkees—Sleenkies?  I shall not lower myself to figuring out the plural form of slinky  (honestly I ain’t sure I got the singular right)  &nbsp;  spring is a season…..  (though I haven’t seen much of it yet)  is it even really spring or have they made spring break in the winter—  What a cruel and malicious trick that would be….  Should I have capitalized spring, because it is a season?&nbsp;  Hmmmm…I’ll keep it lower case to assert my artistic liberties…  ahhh, liberties—our founding fathers would be proud  The right to refuse to capitalize—a spit in the face of every english style manual!!  (HA! I bet they cant ignore style manuals in Havanna—though they probably sell liquor on Sundays and can legally have sex in positions other than missionary)  &nbsp;  The poor children of Havana probably have no slinkees (sp?)  I think the non-springs in question are still made in the US.  And since we have an embargo—they would have to buy them on the black market  Unless some ex-patriot moved the factory to China – as seems to be the trend these days  Black market sales probably make them way to costly for the poor folk….  Could the Army air-drop them?&nbsp;  Like they did when the damned Reds closed Berlin, in the 40’s or was that the 50’s?...  I mean in 1948 and 49…that’s when it happened—  (I read it on the internet so it must be true)  Then I bet the cubans could &nbsp;be executed on site for having the illegal non-spring  probably better we not bother helping—yup, keep the status quo I say….  But what if all the horrible stuff we hear about Cuba is propaganda….my shoes are made in Vietnam, and we fought a war with them—yet they can buy slinkees on the open market.  We never even fought Cuba…except the bay of pigs…and that wasn’t even &nbsp;us..  Perhaps poets should take a course on Geo-Politics?&nbsp;  Substitute that with the Spanish requirements…  &nbsp;  I’ll be damned…..The Slinky® is still made in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania with the original equipment from 1946…  &nbsp;  Wait a second pal!!….look at this, did your teachers tell you to read EVERYTHING not just the tops of paragraphs!?!&nbsp; You learned that in 3rd grade for christ sakes!!  &nbsp;  SPRING--NOUN: 1. An elastic device, such as a coil of wire, that regains its original shape after being compressed or extended.  &nbsp;  I guess a slinky is a spring after-all……And I was right about almost everything else too…. except perhaps the slinky shortage in Cuba….this has yet to be determined……..

      An editorial appeared in the local newspaper this morning by Michael Reagan.  Yes, Michael Regan, the George W. of talk radio....[you really think he would have a syndicated show on 200 conservative talk radio stations if it weren't for his old man?]  In his editorial he slams the Democratic Party for lying, and distorting the truth. [Surpise!!! his editorial is no different.]   And I quote:   "If anybody doubts the truth about this, I invite them to look at one Michael Moore."   Now I’m confused-- Moore became a high-level Democratic official this morning?  He is very active in the party?  Nothing goes down in the Democratic Party now without the approval of  new chairman Michael Moore...  Thanks for the info and congratulations on scooping the Associated Press with your fine column!   Attempting to prove lying by a Political party with accusations against a film maker and private citizen is pretty misleading-- misleading and an insult to the intelligence of the fine group of extraordinary Americans that still read daily newspapers.  And I quote:   "Moore--slime master extraordinary, a practiced prevaricator, hater of America and radical socialist...."   I'm sure nobody sees any distortion or outright hatred in that sentence...  This statement bothered me but what bothers me more than the sentence’s message is Regan's use of the word extraordinary--slime master extraordinary to be exact.  True extraordinary is an adjective in this case.  It's a modifier, in this case he means it to modify "slime master"-- the whole modification is just to show that he believes Mr. Moore to be an extraordinary “slime master”....why not write it like that or perhaps [and how would have written it] just slime master extraordinaire?  Slime master extraordinary just doesn't sound right.  Maybe it's the unimaginative noun that irks me or perhaps the phrase reminds me too much of "Ghost Busters" to be taken seriously. Like many right-wingers-- Regan clearly loves to throw around the word socialist.  The word is "the racial slur" of politics.  Few really know the true definition of socialism—probably due to the multitude of definitions.  Mr. Regan is clearly taking advantage of a simple equation engrained in the fabric of our society.  No, it’s not the Pythagorean theorem.  It is:   Socialist/Socialism = Evil   After the initial comparison images of Stalin, Mao Tse-Tung, Castro and perhaps Satan appear in people’s minds.  True they were all socialists.  Care to guess who else had socialist policies and by that measure could be considered an evil fascist tyrant?  Try the greatest president of the twentieth century-- Frank D. Roosevelt.  The man that should be on the twenty dollar bill, instead they proposed Mike’s old man.   Nothing against Andrew Jackson—any man that gets drunk and rides a horse through the white house gets my utmost respect.  I propose FDR on the twenty and give Jackson the fifty, they can make another unused dollar coin with Grant-- he was a crappy president anyway.  Since the last two sentences had nothing to do with anything pertinent with the rest of this piece let us get back to “socialism”.     Courtesy of American Heritage Dictionary  Socialism NOUN: 1. Any of various theories or systems of social organization in which the means of producing and distributing goods is owned collectively or by a centralized government that often plans and controls the economy.   FDR's new deal was socialism, and it gave a lot of poor people hope and jobs during the depression.  If you have ever read Steinbeck’s Grapes of Wrath, can you honestly say you wanted the Joad family to leave the government camp and go back to the privately run farm?  The family was forced to pick peaches from dusk till dawn to earn one collective dollar, which spent on that night’s meal—they still went to bed hungry.  FDR’s Civilian Conservation Corps and other new deal programs gave decent jobs to many Americans who had no other means of survival.  Tell me how lil’ Regan can turn that into evil?    Many of our allies (or former allies) have socialist driven economies—Canada, United Kingdom, Belgium, Ireland…..basically all of NATO except the United States.  Wait…there are even socialist programs in America?  Yes!! In fact we too are a socialist nation.  Ever hear of social security, welfare, Medicare, Medicade, public schools, public universities, public television, public radio, public hospitals, roads, United States Postal Service, Amtrak [I think it’s still government owned]-- any business subsidized by the government—such as farms.  One could say that by using the term socialist lil’ Regan has taken a shot everyone who has ever mailed a letter using a government stamp.  A true capitalist would have sent it Fed-Ex or UPS.  [Hows that for a no-spin paragraph?]  After several more paragraphs by lil’ Ronnie on the liberal conspiracy to turn America into a Communist Russia--he finally addresses the film. [I thought about calling Mikey a sewage-spewing right-winger but I don't want my dribble to be compared in any way to his dribble]     Perhaps Regan would like to start another Red Scare.  His old man sure benefited from it: When his father was elected after campaigning to bring order to UC Berkeley, he stated "beatniks, radicals and filthy [did he mean free?] speech advocates" were proof of  a "morality and decency gap in Sacramento." He was "damned mad" at university officials, a former agent recalled the FBI to tell him "what he was up against.  J. Edgar Hoover viewed Reagan's requests for confidential information on faculty and students as an opportunity to end the protests at Berkeley. Both men saw the protests as encouraging to other protesters at other universities across America.  FBI records—released through the freedom of information act as well as of interviews with current and retired agents show the FBI:  Worked with the CIA as well as one senior member of the university's Board of Regents in order to incite the board to "harass” students and professors involved in protests. They lied to the president by showing him information the FBI knew to be false.  They attempted covert public relations work to change public opinion about the university and humiliate university officials.  Micheal Regan ends his editorial with a comment made by Moore on the soldiers fighting our troops in Iraq.   “He [Moore] insisted that the terrorists currently killing our soldiers in Iraq can be compared to the our Revolutionary War hero’s who fought off British oppression……This goes beyond a hate crime—it is nothing less than treason.  The Democrats by aiding and abetting and praising this traitorous person share his guilt.  That’s how far their hatred has taken them.”  Sure Michael… a bunch of ragtag rebels fighting off a major power that is occupying their land.  That’s nothing like what our forefathers did in the Revolution.  Besides most of the “terrorists” in Iraq are foreigners and according to Bush came into the country to fight Americans…..right?  Wrong!  Only 29 of the 5,500 currently held “suspected combatants are of a foreign nationality.  Maybe the ability to think objectively comes only after the years of listening to live Grateful Dead shows, smoking the pot, and protesting that mandatory when one decides to become a “socialist”.  [We’ll use a definition that Mike Regan holds close to heart:  Socialist:  Anyone who isn’t a die hard Republican]   If you haven’t smoked enough weed or listened to enough Dead shows please pretend you have for a moment and follow along.  Let us imagine for a moment the roles were reversed.  Saddam Hussein invaded America.  We lost….he won…they later found Bush in a hole somewhere in Texas and put him on trial.  Iraqi tanks are rolling down the street-- killing civilians--looking for underground American combatants.  What are you going to do?  Are you going to give up or are you going to try to fight these Iraqi oppressors like our forefathers did in the revolution?  Can the Iraqis honestly be blamed these people for resisting?  They are only doing the same thing that Americans would do if the roles were reversed.  Even the French resisted the Nazis in WWII and helped us with the D-Day invasion.  It’s true, though I doubt those in-line with the administrations stance on France probably will believe it.  Hell, the French were foreign combatants in our revolution and it’s doubtful we would have won with out them—the British never called them terrorists.  Probably because they weren’t terrorists-- terrorism is a word many on the right love to throw around [kind of like the s-word].  It used to refer to shady characters in Ryder-trucks full of fertilizer and kerosene.  Since September 11th, the “T-Word changed and now applies to anyone opposed to the present administration’s policy.  Since the patriot act was passed the T-Word could even mean a otherwise law abiding citizen that goes to the “wrong” website or checks out the “wrong” book at the vile socialist institutions we pinko-liberals call “library”.    People in the media….cough ….hack…..cough..foxnews…cough…Bill ..wheeze  O’Rielly….cough…sorry I have a bit of a cold.  Yes, people in the media love to call everything that they don’t agree with “Un-American”.  Regan said Moore was treasonous, a traitor an infidel!!  [the infidel thing was a lie, though I am admitting the lie to be completely fair and in-balanced….er balanced].  Un-American, it’s a difficult statement to argue with because there are really citizens see America.  For many people, I assume lil’ Ronnie is one of them—America is the Executive, Judicial, Legislative, Army, Air Force, Marines, CIA, FBI, IRS…..and so on.  If you see the current administration as America then your damn right Moore is un-American and so am I— so is half the country—the half that doesn’t support the war or the president.  To those on the right any belief that hinders the goals of their party is un-patriotic; those who don’t agree need to get out.  “Love it or leave it” they say.  People that speak out against the war love their country no less than those who do, perhaps we care even more—we care about the future of our nation getting their ass shot off half way around the world for no reason, they are America—the administration should serve them, not put them in danger for nothing other than trumped up reasons.  If we didn’t love this country we’d all move to France or Canada and say “to hell with those guys”.  We are the Americans that see our country not as an administration but as people struggling to get through the day.  They go to work, they have dinner, they drink beer, watch the NFL on Sundays, they bitch at the nightly news, they drive cars a 90,000 miles on it-- they don’t get paid enough to justify the work they do all week.  Maybe they worked two jobs and saved so their sons or daughters could go college [since they never did] or maybe their kids are in the military.  Maybe they’re in the middle-east...  What parent would want to risk loosing a son or daughter?  And can you blame them for not wanting to bury a child in a war started over fictional pretenses?  Will you call these people un-American?  I call the men who believe exercising our right to free speech treasonous the real traitors.  What is more un-American than attempting to suppress the opinions of our populous because some members of the media and the government don’t agree with them?  The government is of us by us and for us— remember?  If the government is doing things that we don’t like then it is our right—our duty to attempt to change that fact.  It’s not un-American, it’s called democracy—perhaps Mr. Regan thinks democracy is un-American as well.     Reagan's attack on the film basically involves nothing other than the famous shot of Bush talking about a bombing and then hitting a golf ball--the same scene that was in the commercial.  [he was probably too busy being self righteous to actually watch the film]  Regan says G.W. was talking about a bombing by the Palestinians in Israel during the clip and not talking about Bin-Laden.  If he had seen the film as I did he would know that Moore never inferred anything about the statement, or what group G.W. was addressing.  The clip was used to show how important world events never stopped Bush from taking his precious vacations.  Twenty-seven percent of Bush's total time in office.  Two hundred and fifty days, close to a year and his term isn't over yet.  In Bill Clinton's eight years he only spent 152 days on vacation.  [I swear the only reason Clinton’s vacation stats in the article for you to reference--I assure you I have no opinions about anything that ever happened at any time in any place whatsoever-- therefore, because I say so, consider this article fair and balanced]  In conclusion I would have to say that the Editorial by lil’ Ronnie was quite juvenile in it’s failed attempt to link the Democratic party to one film maker and his assault on first amendment rights was “un-American”.  I guess that’s why he spends most of his time on the radio.

       Only 31% of Men Achieve This By Age 30 The true measure of adulthood is not 18 or 21. The true measure of adulthood is reaching these benchmarks: leaving home, finishing school, getting married, having a child, and being financially independent. By that standard only 31 percent of men and 46 percent of women have reached adulthood by age 30, reports The Washington Post of a study from the University of Pennsylvania. In 1960, fully 65 percent of men and 77 percent of women had achieved these accomplishments by age 30.
