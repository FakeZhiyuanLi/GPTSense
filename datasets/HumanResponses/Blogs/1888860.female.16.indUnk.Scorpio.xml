      PART 2 of The Reunion   There was a gental rocking, his arms wrapped around something warm, cheek against harsh cloth. He stirred slightly, his knees bumping into something, and he automatically tightened their grip as he began to slide, hands gripping needlessly at cloth. there wwere burst of light under his eyelids, but he ignored it, striving to escape the flashes of red by turning his face into the cloth. it didn't work too well, but it also introduced him to the fact that this cloth had a scent. He inhaled deeply, trying to capture it before his swiming mind decided to take him elsewhere. It was dusty, and a little musty like something old, yet there was something rich about it. Drowsily, he decided he had no complaints about the situation, pulling himself closer to the warmth.  "Cloud?"  Abruptly, he felt like a pervert.  He jerked back from Vincent, nearly upending himself off the Chocobo, yelping as this strain on his wound tore it. Red blossumed on the white bandages and he hissed in pain, knoting his hands in his pant's legs. He blinked around quickly, trying to find something to blurt so he could forget about what just happened.  "How far are we?" he asked quickly, blinking at the moutains.  "Nearly there." was Vincent's answer.  Cloud blinked. "Really? This soon?"  There was a moment. "Its been a few days. You spent most of it passed out."  The blond had no responce for this. He was silent for a moment before he spoke again, trying to choose his words carefully. "I am sorry for what happened at the mansion." he said finally.  Apparently Vincent had to think about his answer for a moment also. Or perhaps he just liked dramatic silences. Cloud was starting to bet on the latter. "It was not any fault of yours." he said at lenght, and seemed to be inclined to being silent for the rest of the trip.  Cloud planted his hands on the Chocobo's back inbetween them, looking around. He was hoping that with time, he might begin to recgnize the countryside, but so far, he might as well have been a stranger to the whole land for anything that he recognized. He knew this Chocobo to be a very mild-natured one, so he dared to actaully shift until he was facing backwards, his back sometimes brushing Vincent's.  Ugh. He hated to admit it, but seeing nothing but rise after rise of rock and stone with a few stunted trees thrown in for measure was very boring. He had started fidgiting after not too long, and then takened to, irnoircally enough, cloud watching. He tried watching his boot, but that was boring, so he tried for his namesakes and they were only slightly more interesting. He idly swung his feet in time to the Chocobo's steps, then started in time with his heart beat, and once he got brave enough to lean back against Vincent, the dark haired man's heart beat, though it was hard to keep track of and even harder to find once it disappeared, muffled by cloth. He had to conentrate on it so hard, that the sun was falling from the roof of the sky when he finally snapped to attention, blinking.  "You have a heart murmur?" Cloud asked quizically, finally understanding that was why it was so hard to keep tempo. He felt one shoulder rise and fall against his.  "Only since ... since the incident."  Cloud knew almost instictively that the only thing Vincent let bother him was the experiment. He bobbed his head with understanding. "Thats one sucky turning point in life that we share." He said lightly. "I mean, not that I have a heart murmur, but you know."  Again, that shoulder rose and fell. There was a moment of quiet, and then Cloud chuckled slightly.  "Don't make me start singing old Nibelhiem folk songs." He threatened in a fit of sillyness. "I have a horrible singing voice!"He could feel Vincent's head turn slightly to the side to look at him for a moment, but he did not make good on his threat even though the man did not help him be distracted. He stared idly at the sky, watching one half start to darken, and the clouds on the other half start gathering color. Suddenly, Vincent's back tensed.  "I would not mind. I have not heard any in a very long time."  Cloud started slightly, and it took him a moment to remember what he might be talking about. He colored slightly, and started shuffling through his memories as quickly as possible, trying to find one that might be possible; he knew many since it was usually the only allowed pass time for young children. He laughed nerviously. "I haven't either, and I don't sing very well at all, but I'll try." He narrowed it down to between two songs, did the mental equiviltant to spin in cirlces and jabbing his finger at one. He cleared his throat.  In the darkess, in the night We're lost, condemed with fright Hope has gone, taken away Nowhere to run, but cannot stay.  It was a long song, one that he remembered hearing only once, from his mother. Her voice could do it justices, but his couldn't, and he knew it. He tried anyway. It started out rather dark and tormented, and never got very light-hearted, but that was because it had been written during a war in which the poeple of Nibelheim were sure to lose. And they did.  Trapped between rock and stone I am lost, you are alone Have no reason yet to fight In the darkness no one has light.  It was a stupid war over territory, and many people died for no reason. Why did he ever want to join SOLDIER? Surely he comprehended that it would mean that he'd have to take a life someday. He forced his voice to stay steady as he fished it with the very chourse it began with, sinking in on himself in mild despair and relief. It was a very emotional song for the singer, or at least it was for him. Everytime that he had sung it, he was either in tears or burst into them half way through the song. Granted, it hadn't sung it since he was thirteen and his voice began to change; once it had, he couldn't quiet hit the notes right and left off singing it.  There was a long moment of silence during which Cloud recovered and Vincent did not move.  "I'm sorry." Cloud said at last. "I should have chosen a lighter song."  "No." Vincent said, and again seemed to decided against explaining.  Cloud, left to his own devices once again, took to studing a clump of dried mud on his boot. It looked vaguely like Aerith, but that sounded kinda mean, so he kept it to himself.  "Sit around." Vincent said. "Hold tight."  Cloud immedaitly did so, not even daring to question the man. As he did, he saw why. Fear stained him as he saw the wide expanse of sand in front of them, eyes widening as he wrapped his arms around Vincent's waist, the slender man closing his claw lightly over where the two arms met. Cloud tightened his leg's grip on the Chocobo, eyes alert as they stood stock still on the very edge of the sand. Somewhere out there lurked a monster. But where was it? Suddenly, the Chocobo lurched forward, and Cloud buried his face into Vincent's back to cover the yelp that threatened to escape his mouth. They couldn't have anymore noise than was neccessary. The Chocobo seemed to know the danger, running as fast as its long legs could carry them, and Cloud glanced back.  It was right behind them.  Every muscle in his body seemed to coil at the same time, a lump in his throat as the stared at the shadow, the slight disturbance of the sand. His eyes widened, pupil dialated with fear, breath catching in his throat before it seemed to come too soon and too fast.  A sharp pain in his arm made his head jerk back around, and once he had looked away, he couldn't bring himself to look back, instead tightening his grip on Vincent until the man winced and his wound stung; the bandages probably would have turned red had it not been that color already.  The Chocobo jerked and dodged repeatedly, And Cloud lost track of how many times he was nearly unseated. It was generally not wise to have mor than one rider on a panicked Chocobo as the second rider could not hold ontop the Chocobo iwht his legs correctly. It was only his grip on Vincent and Vincent's own grip on him that kept him on with the harder twist and turns the Chocobo spun.  Then suddenly, they were on firm land again, and the Zolom bounced back, wandering over the swamp, not even lingering once they were out of range. The Chocobo kept running for a while, warking repeatedly in relief before it slowed to a walk again. Cloud hissed in pain as he slowly loosened his grip on the slightly taller man, the golden metal claw falling away as he shifted. The Chocobo suddenly changed direction, and Cloud could tell that they were actually headed slightly away from their destination.  "Vincent?"  "The Chocobo Farm." The man said simply.  "I have a stable." Cloud blinked, then flinched against Vincent's back as he prodded at his wound, testing the new damage. He shifted to the new one on the forearm of the same arm. It was a clean cut, unlike the gorey one on near his shoulder. He poked at it also, ut decided it was going to heal correctly, absently sticking one bloody finger in his mouth. It was a bad habit, but he always made sure not to touch his wounds until he'd washed his hands after he'd do this.  "Your wound." Vincent replied.  Large blue eyes blinked. "It isn't that bad." he sulked, feeling like a child compared to this man of indeterminable age. "Niether of them."  "It tore."  Cloud could not agrue with that, but he still did not wish to stay at the farm, delaying them any futher. "Kalm isn't that far." he protested. He felt Vincent stiffen against his chest.  "I cut an artery." He hissed. "We are stopping, for the night."  Cloud chilled at the sudden emotion from a man he knew not to exibit them. There was plenty of anger in the dark man's voice, though Cloud could not identify who it was aimed at. He fell quiet, wanting to draw away from the man, but not daring too since the Chocobo was still antsy. He kept his good arm wrapped around Vincent's waist, not daring to move as of yet. It was dark.  Time seemed to drag, and by now Cloud realized that he was not doing as well as he had thought. If Vincent truely had cut an artery in his arm, it explained his dizzyness and the days of unconsciousness. How long after he had passed out at the mansion was Vincent finally able to take care of the cut? He might owe his life to the man. Cloud stiffled a groan. Just what he needed. Seriously, he was doing his best to withdraw from the group, and it just seemed that he managed to tangle them even more tightly around himself. He idely studied the stars that were twinkling. He was not a man at peace with himself.  Killing the Monster that Sephiroth had become was still killing Sephiroth. If only he was not so selfish! Perhaps he could have found a way ... Found a way to make the man see what he was doing ... to see the truth, to rest and meld with the Lifestream. Though his memories were still mostly muddled, espeically those around his days of trying to make it into SOLDIER, he could remembe certain things. The General had never spoken to him personally, but it was clear enough he was not a bad person. He actually seemed ... tired, world-weary; he never even lost his temper in public.  Muddled confusion. There was a man he knew, a man that had dark hair and eyes as gold as ... as ... here Cloud could not think of anything to descibe them with, and settled for emotions, states-of-being that those eyes produced. Gold like happiness and contentment and mischief and friendlyness. Eyes like forever. Promises. It was confusing. A name floated in a detatched manner, seemed both connected to the image and not. Zach. Eyes of gold like everything good in the world ...eyes gone blank, eyes gone glazed, and red. Red everywhere.  There was so much ... so much!  Cloud felt like the whole world tipped and began a ballet, spilling light and sounds on the tips of fingers gracefully extended.  So much ...  His stomach clenched and vertigo made hsi vision swim. He tightened his grip on the only thing solid within reach, turning his head to steady himself with the sight of it.  Dark hair and red.  He flet sick.  So much ... so much! Everywhere, all over the place, all over him, and tears and ragged wounds. So many wounds, everywhere.  "Cloud."  It was a simple word, cut clean, spoken emotionlessly. This is what made him snap back to reality.  "Sorry." he croaked, loosening his arm from the man. He felt very tired. Too much blood loss ... too much emotion, too many memories. He blinked around though a veil of tired tears that did not fall. They were very near the Chocobo Farm, and the Ocean Chocobo had once again picked up its speed at the thought of good greens and sleep. Cloud made a noise as they reached it, slowly sliding off the bird so that Vincent could dismount. He staggered, supported himself with the barn, and slow shambered toward the farm house. He felt vaguely bad about leaving Vincent to put up and feed the Chocobo, but he was drained and would probably be more of a hendrence than a help. He was vaguely aware of the door uponing under his requesting knocks, but the world chose that moment to do a piriote, and his legs gave, head striking the floor with a dull thud.  *.*.*

      - it seems that when you are lost, you find me. PG-13 for blood and non-decript violence.   Cloud cursed as he stumbled off the Chocobo. Riding one of those damned things from Kalm to Nibelham is not a suggested thing, apparently. He really hadn't wanted to return to this place, it held bad memories for him, but he had promised Tifa, and really, he was curious as to what had happened to Vincent. This time around, he didn't bother to speak to any of the townsfolk, instead heading straight toward the Mansion.  If he was truthful, he didn't know where Vincent was, really, he just hoped that the man had returned to linger in the halls and under floor boards of this place. Personally, the whole house gave him the chills, always had.  The people quickly developed a "don't-look,don't-tell" attitude when they saw him, so he ignored them, opening the gate to the large worn down building, leaving the ocean Chocobo in the yard to do as it pleased. He made his way over to the door, and plugged his nose as he pushed against the door, dust showering him as he had expected. He screwed his eyes shut until he was certain most of it settled, then moved on into the house. The floor board creaked and the supports groaned as monsters moved about, watching him. He shivered, wondering how such a place could have become so overrun with creepy-crawlies as he picked his way up rotted stairs. He kept one hand ready to snag for his sword, but they left him alone, perhaps sensing the power that sometimes oozed of him when he wasn't paying attention.  Now, lets see... if he remembered correctly ...  The door swum upen, and the world swam. For a moment, he was standing near teh doorway, and some with long silver hair was standing in front of the secret passage. He snapped from the spell, and headed down the stair with determination.  He had to dodge the YinYangs more than once, unwilling to fight the damned annoying things without the help of at least one party memeber. When he finally reached that door the the coffin room, he found himself hovering outside, hand on it. No, that wasn't right. Confused, he turned, continuing toward the library.  Once inside, he found Vincent. The man was standing in front of those two glass chambers, the gold metallic claw on the one Cloud once resided in, the other hand poking through a break, fingures gently rubbing the scratch-marks left inside of Zax's.  There was aqua, light all around, a feeling of weightlessness. And then, distorted, the wavering visage of a dark haired man, large brown eyes filled with determination and pain. Cloud jerked, as if snapping back awake, and the image faded. Vincent's metal hand tapped lightly against the glass twice, and then he turned.  "Yes?"  His eyes were expressionless, an unnatureal shade of red. He had tucked the claw back under his cloak as he often did, his human hand on the table beside then, almost looking to carefully suport the entire weight of the man. He was still wearing the clothing he had when they were a group, though Cloud really couldn't say anything since he was also.  Cloud let his eyes leave the dark man in front of him, roaming over the books that scattered the floor, studying every broken container. And the hallway.  A man with silver hair stood in that hallway, a book held tightly between trembling hands, he paced, eyes roving over the words, the beginings of a scowl on hsi forehead.  "Tifa called the group."  He tossed the book aside, snatching another from the shelf. This one he also flipped through quickly, eyes flashing aqua as he looked over the words, scowl deeping. The scene seemed to melt, and there were stacks of books on the floor, the man with his back to them, tensing. "She wanted us to live together. The whole group."  The Scene swirl dizzyingly, and Cloud had to screw his eyes shut and grit his teeth to avoid reacting. When he opened his eyes, everything was normal. He swung his gaze back to Vincent. "we couldn't find a way to contact you, so she sent me."  It was best not to lie or decieve. Come clean. He still couldn't quiet look at Tifa after he figured out his past and realized she'd lied to him. Red eyes bore into his for a moment, then Vincent dipped his head once. Cloud knew him well enough that he knew this to mean that Vincent had consented.  "Is there anything you need to pack?"  "No."  Cloud turned, starting back up the tunnel. For a man walking in metal boots on stone, it was serprisingly quiet, and the got through the tunnel without any of the mosnters reallizing they were there. When Cloud steped on the first step, the world tilted.  "Wait!"  He turned, looking down the hallway. From the darkness, there was a flicker of red, and Vincent came to a stop in front of them, eyes wide and demanding.  "I'll join your group."  Tifa tensed beside him, Red's tail lashing forward to shine more light on the mysterious man. "Alright." Cloud said quietly. Then the world spun, and he blinked hard before Vincent swam back into focus. He hadn't changed at all. The same smooth face and emotionless stare. Cloud quietly turned back, even though he was sure Vincent wouldn't ask simply because that was the way the man was. Some time during the trip as they were making their way up the stairs, Vincent moved ahead of him. Cloud did not mind, becuase he was tired and sore, and the longer he was in the town, the longer the hullcinations were. He was even losing enough focus that he was responding to them, as he had earlier whilst remembering Vincent joining their group. As they were picking their way down the rotted stair case --  Outside there was just the beginings of a comotion. It had awoken him from his nap on the chair just outside the secret door. With a feeling of dread, he started down the stiars and--  They gave out on him. His leg plunged through the rotted wood, and he started to fall foward, eyes wide with shock. There was a sharp pain in his right arm, but he ignored it as his hands found perchaus, desperately grabbing and wrapping his arms around wahatever it happened to be. When the world jarred to a stop, his eyes were tightly closed, readt for a painful impact even though only his leg had gone through. His heart was hammering in his ears, adrinaline pounding through his veins.  Whatever his cheek was pressed against was warm.  He craked open one eye and then both, seeing golden metal dug into his arm, crimson blood slowly leaking out, large droplets leaveing one or two splatters on the floor. From there he was able to understand that he had his arms wrapped tightly around the man's waist, and it was his stomach that Cloud had his cheek against. He unwond one arms, bracing himself as he carefully extracted his leg from the hole it had created. Once free, he paused, waiting for Vincent to retract his claws so he could let go of the man, but he never moved.  "I can not." Vincent said. "At this angle, I would only cause more damage."  Cloud tilted his head until he could look up at the man. He dare not more for the exact same reason. Cure Materia could only do so much. An idea leaked into his skull, and e could feel the being tinges of pink in his face.  "We need to get off the stairs." he said carefully. "Then we can fix this."  There was a moment of relative quiet, except for the monsters stirring. They were getting bolder with the smell of blood.  "Do no move your claw." Cloud gritted out, waited the second necessicary for Vincent to ready himself, and then lunged forward, his free arm neatly swiping the man off his feet. Right where they had just been, a gigantic ax swung. It would have killed them both. Cloud's mind was working overdrive to keep his double-weighted feet on places that could hold it, Vincent's startlement showed only in the hand that grabbed the back of Cloud's shirt and twisted, his feet twining behind the other man's back, legs tight around his waist to avoid slipping off his hips. This retreat and obvious hinderment was enough to encourage the beast to swarm, and a new wave of adrinaline flooded the blond, keeping him able to react before thinking, barely able to dodge all the attacks. He tried not to react when sudden nauxious fumes filled the air, and right before he was sure to be sick, Vincent shifted and the red cloak's neck slid over Cloud's mouth. It suddenly made sense why he had such apparel. Against his chest, Vincent because coughing harshly, but the blound didn't even have time to feel guilty about stealing the man's protection. They neared the door, and Cloud turned his shoulder into it, the rotting wood giving way under the combined force. He stumbled on the steps, the sunlight blinding, and just barely managed to keep them from falling, which would only have intensified the damage already done to his arm. As it was, he fell to his knees injured arm keeping Vincent against his chest as his other arm caught them. The dark man was wraked with a coughing fit, and Cloud was forced to admire his contentration. The claw had yet to move, even thoug all the exertion had jerked his arm around and caused worse damage anyway.  Vincent uncurled from him, hand going to cover his mouth, legs sprawling outside Cloud's knees. The blound carefully uncurled the metal claw from his arm, biting his lip with pain as the flesh ripped some more, causing a new flow of blood to start. He sat back on his heels, grasping the wound tightly with one hand, the world swming with pain. Whenever he moved, the pain came in quick harsh jabs, and the rest of the time, it was a harsh burning. The Chocobo had warked in alarm and came running over, and Cloud searched through the pack quickly. He found some bandages, but knew it'd take him too long to deal with them, so instead he tied a messy knot above the wound to lessen blood loss, fighting back a whimper of pain. He turned back to the man still sprawled on the ground, eyes shut as he coughed hard enough to cause his whole frame to shake. Cloud unbuckled his hindersome sword, letting it fall as it may, crawling back over to the dark haired man. He had nothing in his pack to help with the nausioua that he knew Vincent was experiencing, so he settled for what his mother did the few time he got too close to the mansion. He manuvered Vincent onto his side so that the coughing wouldn't shake him as much, rubbing small circles on the man's back. It didn't really help physically, but it did offer suport. It was a long while before the force of the coughing lessened, and by this time, Cloud was drowsy and his pants leg had a rather large marroon stain where his arm had been resting. He had stopped rubbing, instead patting, and now he just had his hand on Vincent's shoulder. Thankfully, the pain had melting into an ache, and now he was numb all over.  The world spun.  His eyes pricked as he dragged himself over to the body. There was so much ... so much! Hot tears leaked down his face as he stared numbly. It was all red, red and marroon as the color leaked into the dirt. There was so much! He couldn't even hear the footsteps of the men as they walked away anymore. A hand went out to grasp the sword, and he set it in his lap. So much! Red was everywhere, it stained him in speakles, and he tried to wash it off in tears--  He jerked back into awareness with a sob. He looked around blurrily, unable to quiet tell where he was at anymore. Where was he? He felt light, too light. What was going on? His eyes felt tired, and it seemed too bright, there was too much falseness in the air. He scrubbed at his face, trying to rid himself of the wetness, and whimpered at the pain that shot through his arm. Bwildered and in pain, the world blurring, he gave up, and darkness took him.  *.*.*

      Tifa was very annoyed. It didn't seem to matter what she did, Cloud never seemed to pick up on the fact that she liked him ... that she might even ... and after a bit of watching, she noticed that Vincent seemed to hang around Cloud a lot and visa versa.  Of course! she thought. They're best friends! I'll ask Vincent what he thinks I can do to get Cloud's attention.  It wasn't long after that decision when her chance came. Vincent was was in their "Head Quaters" (as Barret insisted on calling it), idling around the refridgerator. He seemed to be debating on if he wanted the left-over pizza from their game night with the group or an apple. Two very different foods, yes, but they seemed to be what he was focused on. Then again, with Vincent, you really couldn't tell.  "Hi, Vincent." Tifa said shyly. They had never really talked, though she knew him to be a fair and truthful person. He straighten and turned, not even looking slightly surprised.  "Tifa." He said, slightly inclining his head.  "Erm ..." she wrung her hands behind her back, rocking gently back and forth on her feet. It was very hard to find a way to say this.  Vincent's head tilted to the side, slightly, and he shut the door to the refrigerator, moving to sit down, gesturing slightly to the chair near his. Tifa greatfully took the seat, and then fiddle, not quiet able to meet his eyes.  "Is ... erm, well is Cloud okay?" she asked, meeting his eyes ernestly.  "Yes." Vincent answered, though there was a question in his demeanor.  "Its just that ... well ..." she fidgeted, looking around."Do you think Cloud likes me?" she blurted, and blushed.  Vincent blinked at her slowly. "Yes." he said simply. Tifa's heart fluttered slightly with glee.  "Then you think he'd say yes if I asked him on a date?" she asked, some how needing reasureance.  Vincent seemed taken aback. He was quiet a moment before speaking. "He took Arieth on a date." he said.  Tifa frowned slightly. Did he have to bring that up? "So he'd take me out simply because I asked?"  "Yes."  "That's not what I want him to do!" Tifa sighed with despair.  Vincent mearly blinked at her, but she knew his continued presence meant he wanted a further explaination.  "Well, I like Cloud and all, and we're great friends, but ... I want him to ..." she paused now. She couldn't quiet bring herself to say it, and decided on uses euphemisms. "I want him to make me a woman." she said, blushing horribly.  Vincent's expression didn't change. "What are you now?"  She frowned slightly. He had been out of the loop for a very long time ... maybe he hadn't heard that one. "Horizontal tango?" she asked.  No change from Vincent.  "Beast with two backs? Putting the firefly in the jar? Introduce the dragon to the cave?" she was getting rather flustered. "Pop the cherry? Poor man's opra? Cops and robbers without badges? Ride the horse?"  Vincent only seemed to be getting confused.  "I want him to put his hand in the cookie jar!" she sputtered finally.  Vincent blinked. "But Cloud doesn't like cookies."  Tifa was tremebling with frustrastion by now. "I wasn't talking about baked goods." she growled.  "Neither was I."  ~FINI~
