      After a day Of great accomplishments And yet of none A day of never leaving And not being worldly A day of not accomplishing anything of material value That will be of benefit To my material progression After a day such as this I look And with great wonder I regard The accomplishments Of revelations revealed Of friendships deepened And of some renewed Of bonds re-claimed And spirits lifted A day when I can see around me The souls I have touched And in so touching Have blessed And made happy The joy I have added The light I have shared And then I wish That every day Could be like this one.   jo smith, august 2004

        Too long it has been Thank-you For remembrances For bringing  Unity consciousness at times Of deep distress.  Your golden glow filled my being Imparting a peace Of light and love Removing in it’s wake Tears, Confusion,  Hopelessness.  For you are always close Waiting to hold me For holding is the only thing To comfort this despondency I have become.  Courageous accepting detached All these you give to me  I remember when you left Me here You said Never get attached However, holding lightly With love your only gift.  Now I also understand I am to have none with me Forever Just different ones in passing Until work with each Is done.  Ahhhh, yet it is so hard For deeply do I love these souls Each unique Inner light Gasping to be seen.  Yes ! I see you, Yes! Beautiful, you are If only you could see The view from where I stand You would be in awe Of your own radiance.  And would walk like kings and queens Across  softly padded greens Of  private kingdoms.      Jo, summer 2004  , written for my soulfamily

      When love was the only gift, I gave it freely A never ending source I drew from Deep within Across hardwires of black and grey I felt your feelings surge Fingers being interface conductors between you and me With all that is Inbetween Lettered keys and cables Wires silver blue Reached across the miles From me to you. And when you were not there And I no longer here Within my being you stayed The piece u gave so free. Was love The only very real For it passes sight unseen And when aware of you Became my new reality Expansion uncontrolled Caused growth that would not fit Back into who was me.

      Finding a piece of yourself You had long ago misplaced When did you do this misplacing? It was so long ago it eludes you now The memory does not however Now that you have found it again The memory of the loss Rings through loud and deafening And the empty space that mired your soul Is filled once again With joy and light Full circle  Our inner workings Transcribe through reading Of each-other’s words And sensing Of each-other’s Joy And childlike wonder  Yes I said yes Of course I remember you How could I not? You calculate Hmmm Seems like I’ve known you 2 years Or maybe it was 10 I say Well, it seems Like I knew you An eternity In another lifetime  Welcome home   jo smith, june 2004, a mozer poem

      I believe that we are the creators of our own life experiences - both the hardships and the happiness - this was the true meaning of 'free will'.  I believe we are all one and the same being - all rocks, trees, creatures, stars, air, water , the universe itself is us.  I believe that love conquers all and it is the only true and real thing in all the universe.  I believe that all things work towards good for those who are of the light and follow the path.  I believe that when we stop and ask and then listen, the answer will always be given.  I believe that with regard to time, the only moment that really matters is now - this very second  we are in now.  I believe that in life we can learn to forgo a lot of small things that we make into big things un-necessarily by learning and repeating these three words 'It Doesn't Matter', meaning that in the face of our larger lives this particular thing 'does not matter'.  I believe that every second of our life, every person, every animate and in-animate object that crosses our path is a gift that we can choose to leave behind or carry with us always in the un-ending treasure-trove of our brains and hearts and souls.  I believe that the joy is in the journey and I wish to say to you that I feel so blessed and complete to have all of  you  walking the journey beside me......with the greatest of love and peace,  jo

      Good to remember I can create other people’s experiences Isn’t it only right that I should always make sure The experiences I create for them Are good and bring joy To their lives?  I have the choice The joyful experiences  I create for them will expand outwards and touch others Through them  The bad experiences I create for them will cause them to shrink From me and from the world  Always I must choose carefully and consider The consequences Before choosing the action.

         We are here to help you. Your planet terrestria, is a sparkling jewel amongst all in the universe. The creator is deeply saddened and has retreated into private sorrow. As a last attempt to make you see the beauty that still surrounds you the creator has sent us, the messengers, the bringer of the words and to transfer the sadness and urgency as the last sparks of life are extinguished from your home..your sparkling green and blue and fluid place that you have been so entrusted with. The colours you see are only the reflections of your own inner beauty. Where it all went wrong the creator does not know. The creator freely admits this. There is no ego. You now must have the realization that just as you are imperfect so too is the creator. Chaos often reigns supreme. Divine order is amongst the backdrop. The intent was divine order. Alas , in the final dying twilight of the history of your most precious jewel terrestria the creator weeps with you. We come from far away. To us the blink of a starlight. To you an eternity. We know not the fears the greed the all encompassing inner  emptiness you seek to fill. This was not the original intention. Something went wrong. We are here now to tell you that the things without in your sparkling garden will not fill your need. To fill your aching emptiness you must access the portal to elsewhere from within. Only then will you understand and finally see for you will be so filled with that which will be all to you. The creators love. As long as you continue to seek without you will create a deeper and deeper emptiness and terrestria will continue to die her slow sorrowful death. The waters, resources, beings of terrestria will not fill you. They will cause you to age. They will be bring strife and lassitude to your inner being. They will anguish you. They were meant as a backdrop to sense with your 5 senses while your sixth sense served your primary needs. Things have been horribly reversed on this planet ..the creator does not know where the defining moment took place. The sixth sense became the backdrop while you fully exploited and worshipped the things your remaining 5 senses corded with. Herein lies the mistake. The 5 senses which you most often use are your weakest and most unfillable. For always when they are filled the need will become greater. It may be too late. The creator does not know. The creator is not perfect as evidenced by yourselves. It is as much up to you now. We ask that you reconsider. We ask that you observe this precious jewel one last time. We ask that you see it is within you to take care of this precious jewel terrestria. She is your home. Your garden. Forsake her not and realize her fragility as she cries out to you for an end to the madness. For peace. For God’s will to be done, on earth, as it is in heaven.  Loving you into infinity, jo

       Limuria, distant orb of eternal twilight Silver blue in the midnight sky Fleeting memories, I have of u So clear at once And at other silent moments must be intensely summoned.  In my most vividly real memory I am moving through the twilight skies Effortlessly My energy glides Towards the looming pillars afar Wherein lies my waiting city.  It’s been awhile I’ve been away Far too many For one small soul to bare.  Finally My assignment finished The receipt of my home-summoning Arriving none-too-soon.  How will it be? To be home again? After so long On the 3D planet of earth and water Beings of emotions Far too confusing for this one to understand?  My soul has suffered Under the constant onslaught Of fears, angers, jealousies these beings do emanate Never knowing When to shield, when to allow Absorption by my being And then the work of dissipation Before being engulfed For days By that, which is not mine.  And now, home again – no more Dense physical form Just me again Light, free, unencumbered No more consumed by slowly moving Cast-off intendings.     josmith, june 2004, limurian nights

      My Limurian Soul  Oh how I long for you My distant crystal-blue sparkling planet You are a kazillion light years away And even more dimensions. A glimpse, now and then I catch In an artists portrayal In the words of the writer My heart does weep I visit sanctuary meadow From there I can see you clearly And my spirit is refreshed. The yearning will not leave me now For reminders you do always send of late The recent visit from home The smiles and love The regeneration and  encouragement That soon my work will be done And I can return.  jo

        . A distant planet…far removed from here Many dimensions removed as well Not visible by current earth technology even if it were within this solar system as it is in a different space-time continuum than that held by terrestria. The beings of Limuria are pure light energy pure love…..there is no night-day in limuria. It is eternal twilight there. The reason being is the atmosphere of limuria is very hazy and does not allow the transmission of nay light energy. There are no plant forms on limuria in the sense of earth plants. In fact there are no animal forms either.There is only energy. The beings of limuria are loose energy masses..to you the earth being they would appear as ‘ghosts’ in the darkness. However they are not ghosts. They are pure love energy. They have no sex..sex is not necessary on Limuria for there is no procreation..only transformation. Oftentimes the limurians will choose to visit here on earth plane. They are able to do this instantaneously as they have mastered the concept of universal energy transformation through time and space which is non-existent when you are limurian. Limurians never die. There is no concept of time on limuria. The only concept is of love. When earth- based human feelings of anger, fear and jealousy  are introduced into the limurian being the being becomes somewhat confused having nothing to gauge these emotions against. The limurian does not understand why all beings here on earth plane can not feel eternal love for one another. Nor do they understand greed and game playing. A limurian is a very transparent being. All thought s and emotions from without freely enter the limurian physical form. This is why often limurians are private shy individuals. They are , however extremely loving and kind seeking only to bring peace and harmony to all situations for this is how it is in their home dimension. They consistently try to re-create home here on this plane.      josmith, may 2004, a message from home
