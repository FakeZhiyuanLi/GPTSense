      Too many hours staring at the computer and arguing with pompous history teachers in the tes forum has left me rather the worse for wear today. Truly feel fried, and now (its 17.07pm) I cannot wait for these 23 mins to pass so i can go home to my bed. After days of strip-washing and luke-warm baths (which must be taken as quickly as possible before the water all leaks away through the non-fitting all-purpose carpenter's plug) i thought the hell was over, and ventured into the newly grouted shower. Hopes were quickly dashed. Barely had my wet hair anticipated the shampoo before the shower went cold and i was forced to flee, tying my hair in a wet ponytail to hide its greasiness. What is more, on inspection the new grouting proved to have leaked anyway, ensuring that we will be unable to shower tonight or tomorrow, even if we can get the water-heating to work at the right time. I think i may start going for early morning gym sessions, if nothing else to enjoy a hot shower afterwards! (those of you who know me will know how likely THAT is to happen!)

      Well, to hell with this daily updating - i'm a busy girl! Not especially busy at the moment though. In fact, very short of things to do. Been expending my advice on the i-teen website freely today, hoping for a chance to build up enough of a relationship to mind-control them all into subscribing to our website, and practicing for when we get the new forum up and running (rubs hands gleefully) allowing me to act as agony aunt to millions! Well, to a few at least. However, running very low on current occupations - all seems to be geared toward next term now. And there's only so much internet surfing a girl can do! At least i have jonathon ross on the radio to keep me company, now simon has provided me with a computer that a) likes acrobat and doesn't seize up whenever i try to use reader and b) has working speakers! Hooray for radio-music-chat type distractions.

      Woops! Forgot you yesterday, didn't i! Not to worry - you aren't alone - i also forgot to phone my Dad - and it was his fiftieth!! Happy birthday Daddy - i did text!   Anyway, back to working life. Been doing a LOT of internet surfing and not a lot else this week. Tried a bit of brainstorming, and came up with some hooks for our teen market, but feel i would benefit from some form of business and marketing qualifications in this job. Sure, i get ideas eventually, but i spend a lot of time asking others for advice in order to get there. Definitely taking a business studies course in September.  Have a busy evening tonight. The match is on while still at work, so will be listening to 5live for that. Then i need to get Daddy's birthday present AND a skirt for his James Bond themed party on saturday night before meeting Sarah C for drinks at 6.30pm to toast the new flat. I'm gonna wear my leather top and spiked heels, but need a pencil skirt to complete the look. In an hour?! Might be a push... But i am a shopping expert, so i might just manage it. That glass of rose will be well earned if i do...

      Woohoo. Finally settled into the flat. Got the rest of the stuff unpacked last night, spent a good couple of hours rearranging the living room in an attempt to accommodate the huge desk that one of the former tennants is coming back for in September, but eventually sorted it. It's really pretty now its inhabitable! We have fairy lights and everything! Work is going fine, i'm settled enough to feel comfortable doing my own thing and improvising when i'm short of work. Can't write much though - got a meeting and plenty to get on with today. Spent yesterday getting ahead for the rest of term, so thats one load off my mind. This is a really boring entry - think i'll leave it now...

      As far as I understand it, weekends are for relaxing and recuperating, allowing one to return to work on monday morning feeling refreshed and ready to face a week's work. That is exactly how i don't feel today. My weekend went something like this: Saturday: 7am, get up, pack stuff. Walk to town to drop off stuff at charity shop and pick up boxes from kwik save. Pack (with brief excursion to choose paint) until 3.30, then head to Sam&Fam's for a nice relaxing (and well-earnt) game of croquet and a break. 6.30pm, head home, then round to just vacated flat for general cleaning. Midnight, home and supper. Bed. Sunday: 6am, get up, kick euan inton action, finish packing and spend 30 mins (euan's shower time) lugging boxes up and down stairs ready for loading. Head to flat for cleaning and painting. Shop for basics (bin, kettle, plates, saucepans, etc)and 'borrow' trolley from Woolworths to get them all home! Leave paint to dry, stack sofa's on top of each other and unload van (loaded by Euan and Johnny (flatmate) during our shopping excursion)into newly made floor space. Head to Ikea (leaving euan to finish fiddly and hard-to-reach areas of painting) for tv stand, shelves, etc. Unload Ikea purchases, then head to Johnny's to load up his stuff, pick up remaining from euan's and head back to flat to unload. Set up one sofa and tv on a box of books so as not to miss all-important (and highly disappointing) England - France match. Begin to unpack. Continue to unpack til 2am, at which point find the sheets and am able to make, and subsequently go to, bed. Didn't stop for lunch all day - merely ate crisps, half a pasty, then a burger from the van on the corner at half-time. And havent't even made a dent in the boxes in the living room. Gonna ask to leave a little early tonight i think!

      Actually, when i say deliberately late, i didn't mean to be quite as late as i was. I meant to walk to work to arrive at about 9.15, but as i left the house it started to rain, so i decided to go and watch TV for half an hour then get the metro in. After about 10 mins it naturally cleared , so i walked. Was still somehow in town for 9am, so decided to have a browse in primark, whereupon i stumbled across a couple of lovely lemon and turquoise vest tops and a pleasant white bag that would actually fit both my essentials AND my lunch and hence put an end to my carrying 2 bags in and out of work everyday. I had to purchase, and inevitably ended up in a rather extensive queue - hence my arrival at work at 9.25am. Was still second into the office, but since Paul is working from home today and Anthony is racing across Germany in a race-car as we speak, being second into the office also makes me second to last. The good news is that i don't feel such a goody two-shoes now! I guess thats a start.  I really must go read the TES now, but before i do, let me fill you in on the saga of the flat. We have now made an appropriate plan of action, involving loading the van on saturday night, cleaning at 6am sunday, painting after lunch, and unloading the van in the evening. We'll have to sleep elsewhere sunday night while the paint drys, but are aiming to start unpacking and move in on monday evening. I'm so impatient to get settled - been living out of a capsule wardrobe FAR too long!

      Oh dear. Not a great start to the day. Its a beautiful morning, warm and sunny, so I decided to walk into work. Being bored with the long and smoggy Great North Road, i decided to try a new route, and promptly got lost. Still, somehow managed to get to town in time to do a little shopping in M&S and pick up some milk while still being first to arrive at the office. Had a sinking sensation on arrival, but chose to ignore it and get stuck in. Big mistake. The door stuck, couldn't get in to turn off building alarm - ended up standing outside for 10 mins awaiting Simon, (who naturally opened the door without a problem) watching the passers-by stare suspiciously, taking in every detail of my face just incase they needed to identify me on crime watch next month... Why me?

      Today i decided to be a rebel, that is, to go shopping before coming to work to pick out some eye drops for my sore, hay-fevered peepers. Of course, not much was open at ten to eight in the morning, but I nevertheless made the most of the large Boots store in Eldon square to browse the make-up and hunt manically for eye-care. I left feeling just a little bit naughty, knowing i would be arriving later than ever before (about 9.10am) and expecting the doors to be welcomingly unlocked. Dissapointment began to swamp my belly on approach to the office. About halfway down Grey Street I spotted a man apparently lurking outside the office entrance. I was right to feel trepidation. He was waiting to commit some act of mainenance on the building, and there was as yet no-one here to let him in. My ears are now filled with constant testing of the building's various alarm systems, although, reassuringly, he did say he would shout up at my window if there was a real fire...  Began the working day with a most encouraging email from my dear friend Vikki. Her recent work at Canongate has lead her a reassuring discovery - that NO-ONE in publishing knows what they're doing! Its just that the more experienced publisher doesn't worry about it - s/he just laughs it off! There's hope for us all yet!!  God - I have got to find out how to answer the phones. One of them has rung about five times already this morning, but by the time I work out which it is and got half way to the offending desk it has rung off. That will be my task for the morning. Oh, the things we go through...    12.24pm: Interesting fact of the day: Its much easier to burn yourself on a round tea-bag - there are no corners to hold on to! Think about it (she says sucking her poor, burnt fingers)

      9.12am and i'm first in the office again. After a ten minute struggle with the beautiful-but-deadly sash windows i can once again breath, despite the muggy tightness brought on by the thunder storm that has been raging on and off since 5am when Euan left for work. The thunder is quite spectacular, although it would be better if the lightning weren't lessened by the bright sunshine that is fighting its way through the clouds. If it ever breaks through, we might be lucky enough to see something of Venus travelling across the sun's surface. I did say if...  I've gotta go do soome work - got the most ridiculous amount of quick links to update today - one for each exam being sat tomorrow. Could be a long day...

      Well, its monday morning, 9.08am, and i'm feeling very responsible, if a little nervous. You see, as i was leaving on friday evening i was handed a set of keys to the office just 'incase' i was ever first here. Well, today i rolled in at three mins to nine - and there was (and still is) no-one here. Thankfully, i successfully disabled the alarm and opened the doors (some of you will know the strange problems i have with door opening!). So now i am sitting here, awaiting a boss (or indeed a colleague of any sort)and trying to continue last weeks work with as little ado as possible. Ah! Here comes a colleague now - and one i havent met before at that! Must go exchange pleasantries...   Ah, very nice young man! Anyway, better get going. Need to write up a few reviews and comments for some cartoon strip sites i want to add as links. Also, trying to take my mind off a full weekend of arguing with euan over just how much of his 23yrs accumulation of junk will actually fit into our tiny, shiny new flat. Packing with boys is a nightmare - at the same rate i'm packing stuff euan seems to be finding more stuff to make a mess. Nearly had to sleep in the spare room last night, thanks to excess dust and untidiness! However, must stop thinking about that. Must try to take mind off paint colours and concentrate on web site. How about a nice, calming minty blue for the bedroom?

      This is a sort of online diary for consultation by those starting in publishing. I began my brand new job as web editor on wednesday of this week, and had no idea what on earth to expect. As a result, i thought it would be interesting to publish an online account of what i had to do and how i went about facing it for future entrees into the publishing/new media field...  A couple of my classmates from stirling university's 2003-4 MLitt in Publishing Studies course have also begun work over the last couple of days (Hi Katie, Sarah, Vikki..) so i'll also add in anything that they encounter that might be of interest. I can say for certain that Katie's first morning was identical to mine - coffee with colleages and general introductions. Everyone here seems really nice, and its good to be part of a small company, as it enables you to improve skills slowly and grow with the business. Being the only girl in the office is interesting, especially as i will be living with two boys and so have very few oestrogen encounters at all these days, but i have brothers, so i'm sure i'll cope. Back to work, i began my afternoon brainstorming ideas for the improvement of the web page, and have spent all my time since on and off-line, backing up my brainstorming with research. As a matter of fact, i would never had started this blog were it not for the research i was asked to do for the company. As for the atmosphere, its laid back and easy, hours are roughly between 9 and 5.30, lunch is eaten at the desk and bought from the local sandwich shop, and tea is made on a regular basis! Today is friday, and i am still busy with research and fleshing out of ideas. Its a pleasant enough life!  TIP OF THE DAY: My first tip to those starting a new job is to find out as much as you can about the sector. The easiest way to do this is to go to websites and register for newsletters, whether from timesonline or the guardian unlimited site, TES for educational publishers or media guardian for all, its the most hassle-free way to keep up to date. Speaking of which, i must go back to my TES and decide what needs adding to our NEWS section this week...

      Woohoo! This is my brand new blog. Its really a project researching just how easy creating a blog can be - it appears to be childsplay to get started. Any comments on how easy maintaining is will be most welcome...

      Well, i missed a load of entries, but hey, i'm a busy girl! I have daily web links to update, and copy to write and.. well, not that much more than that, but thats quite a lot! And i have to keep up with the tes forum too! Very hard and time-consuming work!  Having a bit of a nervous breakdown when it comes to the flat. The shower (or more specifically the hot water tank) has a vendetta against me. Haven't had a hot shower since my last trip to the swimming pool (yes, i have been indulging in early morning swims! All part of my new keep-fit routine!). Really am fed up of following euan into the shower, which is almost certainly hot when he goes in it, only to be met with ice-cold water. I NEED to wash my hair! Really gonna cry if it happens again.  Going to the gym tonight, then kara-t-robics tomorrow. Went to beginners aerobics last week. Was surprised to find that i didn't really even work up a sweat. Should've been called 'obes-e-robics' for the people there. The poor tutor just kept telling me to add hops and jumps in. It was quite a confidence boost really! Quite certain the opposite will be true of kara-t-robics tomorrow. Will come out feeling fat and useless and aching all over. Much better way to end a work-out, surely! Especially can't wait for the satisfaction of being unable to walk up-stairs...
