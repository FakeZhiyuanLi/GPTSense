                         So, the Jai is   in his waiting for the Potter book. It is not yet arrived. Thus, Jai is running outside every five minutes and chasing after delivery trucks...anyway. 90 minutes 'till my first driving lesson. Should be fun. No, not fun, what's the word... painful.  That's the word.  Stay inside, lock your doors, authorities have the situation...well, go ahead and  panic  then.

           Peace in.  Humza's party    roxored my boxors   to a great degree. And there was  much  rejoicing. :-D         In other news, TECHNOLOGY     HATES     ME.   Evidence:   (1) Comcast's email-server seems to have died, or I've screwed up my computer and killed Outlook.    (2) The javascript on my blog isn't working    (3) I have to take Health over the summer      Wait , you say,  health class doesn't have anything to do with technology!     Oh, but how wrong you are. If we lived in a society where technology had advanced to the point where either [a] there would be no need to teach everyone all this silliness about disease, death, and how to avoid it or [b, the  better  alternative] technology made everyone smart enough to render such classes  obsolete . So, grrrrrr.      I hate Faulkner. Hate hate hate hate. Maybe I'll grow to like him, but this has yet to happen. But, at least I've started. I will   NOT   repeat last year,   under any circumstances . So, yay, I suppose.     Driving class tomorrow, 1-3. Stay off the roads, I'll be reading HP5 at the same time.   39 minutes left!     Yayfor centerage.  Peace out.

      My dad's friend, Greg, just died. I didn't really know him, but I met him once or twice. We went to Cancun with him and his family. Real nice guy. Had three kids, about my dad's age. He worked for my dad, but it didn't really seem like they had a boss-worker relationship. It was more like two friends who did work together, but differently. Or maybe I'm just waxing romantic. I feel numb, cold all over without any notiable change in temperature. I don't feel devestated or deeply depressed, just numb. My dad is taking it hard. He never cries. He needs hugs, a return on all the strength and support he's lent me since I was born. I can't imagine what he's going through I've never lost a friend and I don't want to know what it feels like ever. My dad starting talking about his own death, what I have to do. We joked, it helped him, along with a few drinks. I don't want to talk to anyone for a while. God, I can't imagine how my dad is feeling if just seeing him makes me feel this way. The dead don't grieve, they suffer no loss. It is the living who mourn, the living who are the victims of death. They shed tears for their own loss, because befriending someone is about slightly blurring the edge between you, so part of you becomes them and part of them becomes you and when they die its like a little bit of a piece of you falls into the earth and you weep. And they weep for the world, for the loss of that person which the world so deserved to keep. Love is loss. If you love that which will be lost, then mourning is just a part of love, a phase. I like the picture I put in my last post, it's comforting and serene and peaceful and good.  I want to dissolve on a bed of flowers. All's stony, everything is further apart. I don't know I don't know I don't know.

      So today I met with my EE adviser, Mr Taylor, who pointed out that my paper could use some of those, whaddya call them, oh yeah, SOURCES. I should get on that. Apparently his mom went to high school with Dukakis. I wonder if he was a hall moniter, and if so did he let bullies out between periods to beat up and steal lunch money?  *kicks self for rim-shot political joke*  Then I went to Madame Johnson about my self-evaluation, but didn't have the proper form type dealy, so I had to go into the IB office. Then I left the IB office with the wrong form and did't want to go back in. Then I went in and discovered that the form was in a room that shouldn't have been gone into at that particular moment. Then I left the room and resolved to avoid it for the next several months.  Now I just wasted ten minutes trying to get rid of Josh, who is an asshole. He slept to friggin' 2'o'clock today, hence my carrying in the disgustingly heavy things my mom got home, for thirty minutes, by myself. Now he tries to wrest (yeah, I said 'wrest'!) the computer from me so he can misspell words to his friends. Grrrr. It'd be a shame if some of his files went missing...Anyway, my mom says I get to keep it for another hour.  So, back to my day...oh, right, being at school for an hour. Eventually I got back to Madame Johnson and she gave me the requisite forms, and hopefully she won't flunk me for forgetting to turn this in two days ago.  My mom picked me up and set forth to Wallmart, or possibly Kmart, or Targetmart, or some giant box filled with cheap merchandise. Tess and me played catch with a giant bouncy ball in the luggage isle while my mom got various stuff for the imminent Costa Rica trip.  Then I went home and did nothing for several hours, and by nothing I mean play sim games from the mid-90's. \/\/00+. At some points my mom brought home the aforementioned obscenely hevy rugs and I failed to wake up Josh despite my best efforts. Then I remembered the colassal mass of papers scattered about the attic and tried to tame some of the more highly evolved stacks, but eventually gave up. Then I came back to the computer and wrote this. Fascinating stuff.  I gotta get started on that Long Fuse... *your mom has a  short  fuse! Oooooooo...* Yeah, I deserve that mental bitchslap.

      Sam's pary was fun, though my fun was temporarily interrupted as Correll nearly convinced me that I'd have to retake all of my driving classes. A thurough scanning of the MD DMV site has convinced me that he links of sties.  Whaelse...those numbers are still happy. Yup. Bouncybouncyweeee.  Gotta get packing for Costa Rica...it's funny, my overall situation hasn't changed over the past 12 hours, but the relief of knowing that I won;t have to retake those god-awful classes just fills me with joy...so much better.   Happiness=d(Situation)/d(Time)  On the upside, my sudden burst of anxiety prevented me from ordering anything from CmDonald's on the way home...my dad's an idiot for getting drive-through at midnight. And for picking me up late.  I need to go study for my learner's renewal tomorrow.  -Jaiwithapermit

      I feel like the yellow line down the middle of a long-deserted highway, whatever that means. I think.  Listening to "experimental Film" and drawing little video clips in my mind. Happiness.  An hour of seesaw conversation on the phone is happy and depressing and confusing and ends up depressifying, so I mope. But better now.  Packing for Costa Rica almost done and driving arrangements for Sam's party done with the MC, fer shizzilous. That reminds me, I need to email him a clever Your Mom joke...one second...  There we go. Phone call...Yay! See that little blurb about the earlier conversation? It was depressing and is now all better. Life gets...let's see...four-and-a-half points.  Right, the point of this post that gives it a title. I can't think of any commentary that would make it any more amusing than it already is,  urlLink so just click , why don't you?

      Feeling grimply.  My day:  3:30 - Wake up. Tired, but can't sleep. Somehow uncomfortable in a way I can't put my finger on.  4:00 - Give up on sleep, decide to face the world on four hours of it. Get up, do dishes, eat brekfast, check some blogs read some history and some other books (Amazon delivered yesterday).  9:00-10:00 - Clean out 1/2 of the garage. Apparently this has something to do with the kitchen and new cabinets. Meh.  11:30 - Leave with dad for library to copy and turn in Costa Rica forms. Waste about a dollar on my inability to work a copy machine.  12:30 - Arrive at school with forms and copies in tow. Building services guy at door says school is closed till three, I can't even go to the mail room for a second. Go to movies and catch snippets of "Stepfod Wives" And "Day After" instead ("Stepford" is a great wry comedy).  3:00 - Arrive back at school, which is still totally deserted. Call Laura, who's also having a sucky day.  3:05 - Building services lady sneaks me in to school. Get to ride in elevator and turn in forms.  3:25 - Catch bus, call mom who tells me to get off at Rockshire and head down to the pool.  3:35 - Arrive at pool, told to wait an hour for practice to end. Decide this is a bad idea and walk home instead.   4:25 - Almost home, meet some kids selling lemonade for a quarter. Awesome and cheap.  4:30 - Arrive home. Eat and drink dinner.  It's raining. Rain is good. I wish I could be a raindrop, that'd be neat.

      PCTYS is supposed to go away after a few days, but it keeps coming back. I miss it. So much. I need far better vocabulary to describe...no, the English language was always weak anyhow. Now, I feel - I don't know, sensory deprived, like everything I feel has been cut in half. I miss waking up and seeing people who I really enjoy being around, people who are smart and wierd and funny and overt and don't bother with any of the ill-concieved social customs that get bolted onto every other aspect of life, like complimenting people you don't like and carrying on empty conversations for hours. And more and more I find myself doing just that, rambling on to people because I want to feel good again. I want to be surrounded with laughter and inane jokes and people being happy. And instead, I'm spiraling into cliches. Heck, even blog rants are cliches. And complaining about blog rants in blog rants. Ad infinitum.  And what, you may ask, triggered this rash of teenage hormone-driven angst? John's blog, specifically the archive from August 2003. I was reading this becuase I couldn't think of anything better to do. So I did. And it was talking about Tom and George and Maddie and Sarah and me in all caps and how awesome all were. And I realized that that was the peak of my life and it is now gone.  Yark, I'm growing for overly-muchful angsty. Some fakeful words'll upper me better.  Nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia is not edible, Nostalgia is not edible, Nostalgia is not edible. Nostalgia, nostalgia, Nostalgia in not edible. You can NOT eat nostalgia... (Which is a good thing, I suppose)

       urlLink    So I finally get around to googling for colorblindness tests, and  urlLink here's  what popped up. Maps: The first three look the same at first glance, but on closer inspection I realize that Russia is a slightly different color of (red in the first map, green in the second and third) and China looks washed out in the third. The last map is just a bunch of various purples.  All three dot patterns in each row look identical.  The three ballon pictures look the same at first, but I can detect some sort of change in the left-most color of the foreground balloon (not the yellowish corner, but bellow and to the right of that), but I can't tell if any of them are red or green.  This could mean that I have double colorblindness. Boozor.

      John apparently has some sorta livejournal type dealy. Is Hendelville part of Buttertown, or vice versa? Or maybe it just got renamed. Who would do...oh, right, the Turks.  I smell Indian food a'brewin'. And the creepy sound of a pressure cooker being opened.  Did most of my Costa Rica shopping yesterday. (Random: Why isn't the prefix 'yester' used more often? I should fix that.) I stil gotta get some more stuff, some osrta mosquito cage type dealy. And I should probably make some vague attempt to get in shape before partaking in hours of backbreaking hard labor. Meh. And I'd better start on that Cipro...  Downstairs my sister is playing some computer games that involves lots of popping and whistle noises. Neat, by which I mean annoying.  'The Long Fuse' is the best history text we've been assigned EVER. It winseseses.  Whaelse...  Downstairs: "Brunch is ready!" And away I go.

      Wake up at the crack of fivethirtyish for my veryvery first Costa Rican cold shower. I think I did pretty well, recalling the wisdom my dad had gained in India.  Step one: Turn on water, full blast. Step two: Jump into water, get entire body wet as quickly as possible. Breathe heavily. Step three: Turn off water. Step four: Apply soap and shampoo. Step five: Turn on water full blast again and jump back in, rinsing off everything.  Anyway, I survived and was rewarded with breakfast, by which I mean COFFEE. Good stuff. No rest for the weary, though: We soon backed up and boarded our beloved bus to travel to a city to buy various stuffs (water and sportsdrinks for me, a bunch of water for everyone, and Laura got this neat candy type dealy). Then we walked over to this little town square where school children were performing dances and instrumental music and singing and other happy things. Was the happy. We sat around for about an hour before returning to the bus where we were issued really nifty little rice candy thingys. I pocketed mine, promising myself that it would be a reward for finishing the infamous hike to the rainforest station, which we were informed was "not up all the way. It's down all the way and then up all the way." Yikes.  So we board the bus again and set of for a few hours until we get to this little town next to the mountain with a restaurant dealy. The only thing I remember was the hot peppers, which I ate and pretended to not be bothered by while I downed a full glass of water and another of juice to cool my mouth off. Then we returned to the bus for a short trip to the beginning of the trail. Our big luggage was thrown into a truck, which would go ahead of us while we hiked with our backpacks.  The hike actually went pretty well. The scenery was beautiful (understatement): expansive stretches of green in every direction, majestic cascades of rock rising out of the earth, mountains that vanished into the clouds, waterfalls we could walk across, and an assortment of brightly-colored wildlife. The weather wasn't too hot or windy or humid, and the trail got more interesting as we went down (and up) it. I think I owe my dad's side of the family some thnaks for the centuries of evolution that went into producing good uphill-hiking genes. Yay!  Near the end of the hike we got our first real taste of Costa Rican Rain. It's kinda like Costa Rican driving in that it's insane, unpredictable, fast, dangerous, and common. But it felt good after a few hours of hiking.  Finally got to the rainforest station, 5 rooms in a little structure in the middle of a cloud forest,after one last really big hill. We unpacked into our rooms (Correll, Aubrey, Cris Conroy and me shared a room) and relaxed/dried off for a bit. Ate dinner a few hours later and then went on a night hike, where we saw crabs, bugs, frogs of various colors, and heard some monkeys. Turned in for a good night of sleep.

      Um, speaking of Day One, here's a rough sketch of what went down in the last few hours before life went CostaRicancentric.  I got up at...don't remember, except that it was later than I planned. Soon realized that since DMV closed at noon, any hope of getting my permit that day was lost. Would have to wait a month. Soon thereafter, I realized how much preperation I had to do for Costa Rica - and how imminent Humza's party was. Heavy hearted, called Humza to tell him I couldn't make it. But he seemed okay, and I'm sure whatever his mom cocked more than cheered up the party.  At this point, Costa Rica takes over my life.

      Well, calling this "Day One" is a little sketchy, since I'm not really sure when the day before this day ended and this one began. Anyway, thanks to my unwavering dedication to time-management skills and organization, I was scrambling to get packed right into the last minute. With hours to go dad took me to the Home Depot for a few last supplies and a neat 14-piece knife tool dealy for my host dad. Getting home, the next 8 or so hours are spent picking out clothes, sealing them in ziplock bags, grabbing equipment, running through checklists, gathering documentation, double-checking things with my parents, getting last-minute advice, desperately trying to recall what little Spanish I knew, unpacking, repacking, and cursing paperwork in general.  By the time all was said and done it was about 1:30 am We had to be at Reagan at 4:30 am, which implied leaving the house at 3:30 am. With two hours to kill, I decided to make a mix tape for the longish bus, car, and exist times that were said to pepper the loose schedules of these trips. In between playing CDs right next to a tape-recorder, I cleaned up the debris from my frantic packing frenzy.  Around 2:45 the tape was done, so I decided to grab one last hot shower. Went ahead and did the whole Morning Hygene Routine (tm). Went downstairs to find my dad watching some unsuccessful mid-90's film in which Keanu Reeves plays the son of Satan, a lawyer. Had a breakfast of rice and reheated Indian food before my dad and I set off for the airport.  I was the first one there (for once) and discovered something peculiar about Delta flights: They don't offer any sort of check-in until 5:00. Three cheers for planning. Anyway, it isn't too long before Laura, then Mr Leary and his son, Mike, and the rest (Correll, Aubrey, Chris, Melissa, Erik, Kristen, other people whose names escape me right now) to show up and wait for the counter to open. Anyway, we get checked in, do the security thing, and settle in the terminal for a good, early-morning game of apples-to-apples. Boarding begins on-time :-D. Because I have a weird seat thing, I do some on-plane swapping with non-GlobalWorks-oriented adults to get next to Laura, where I fall asleep upon takeoff.  Get to Atlanta, get off plane, go to next gate (same terminal:-D) and lay down for a short nap. Just as I'm getting comfy, I realize that I don't have any of my tickets or documentation on me. If I had a bit more sleep I would have paniced, but instead I just ran back to the arrival gate, boarded the plane with a security guard, grabbed the documents from the pouch in front of my seat where I had left them, and raced back. I get to board the plane, switch seats, and fly asleep again. I'm pretty sure there was a bad in-flight movie at some point, and I vaguely recall some sort of lunch happening.  We land at the San Jose airport four hours later, wait in long customs lines, grab our bags (there was a short drama as Laura though her bag had been lost, but it came out a few minutes later), get on a cool little bus-dealy with extra folding seats (Laura, Aubrey, Correll, and me sit in the back, I think) and get our first taste of Costa Rican roads.  The United States has traffic laws.  Costa Rica has traffic suggestions. You know, little tips like "stay on the right side of the road" which you may take or leave as you please. But you get used to the oncoming trucks after a while. You know that scene with Harry Potter on the crazy Knight Bus? Like that, only with Correll instead of a shrunken head.  We get to the bed and breakfast, lug in our luggage (this is the first time I realize how big, unwieldy, and awkward my blue-or-purple duffel bag is) and hang around. Aubrey, Correll, and me marvel at the Teenage Mutant Ninja turtles covers on the bunkbeds and comment on the innaccuracies portrayed in the turtle's colors. Cards are played, suns are setted, dancing lessons are foisted upon us (I can dance, and by 'dance' I mean 'fail'), food is served (as is my first taste of Costa Rican coffee), more cards are played, and the extra two hours we've gained en route are spent just generally hanging around. Correll, Aubrey, someone else, and me were engaged in some sort of football (American) at some point. Sad. Sleep is welcomed.

      Costa Rica: Finished. So I suppose now it's my sacred duty as a blogger to post a play-by-play of the past three weeks, lest my massive global audience spontaneously combust in anticipation. Just look at how many comments I've gotten:-). Some of the neatest stuff is the most recent, but I'll be getting to that later. I'll probably refer to Laura's ultra-detailed dairy for more detail later, but this'll do for now.  Day one starts on next post.

      Hot dogs. It all started with hit dogs. Specifiaclly the hot dogs that my brother Josh had left in the microwave without cooking, without a plate, allowing fun little hot dog juices to spill all over the microwave. When my mom opened the microwavve to see this, she was oderately upset and told Josh to clean it up. Despite having done nothing but watch television all day, Josh refused and quickly got into a shouting match with my mom. It escalated to the point where my mom slapped Josh, at which point Josh yelled "Go ahead, hit me again! huh?" Without thinking and overcome with anger, I walked over and hit Josh upside the head. A scuffle between him and me ensued, ending when he landed a good punch on my face. I took a step back, trying to figure out what to do next, but Josh had stopped fighting. My mom started yelling at him because now I would need stitches. "Why? I'm not cut." I said. She corrected me. Josh's punch had opened up a nice little laceration below my left eye. Josh was sent to his room and I got cleaned and bandaed up. I cried - it wasn't that my face hurt (a punch in the face actually hurts surprisingly little) but I always cry after fighting. Badness. Anyway, I got over it and got a bunch of ice in a bag on my face. My mom thought that I needed stitches, but I thought the cut wasn't that deep.  The next few hours (say, 5:30-7:30) were spent going about normal life with a bandaid and a patch of ice. Anybody who was in the Alcove IRC thingy - that was this time. When my dad got home and looked at the cut (which was still bleeding) he was afraid that it would leave a permanent scar if left unstitched. My dad insisted on bringing Josh along to the hospital, so the three of us packed into the car and went. On the way there my dad said he probably would have opted for the scar because it's 'cool to have scars'.  The wait at the hospital was short and everyone was really friendly-likeish. I got a vision test (I'm reguarly 20/30, but the eye above the cut actually improved to 20/25 in some bizzarre, Marvel-comicsesque injury sort of way). Asked how I got the cutbruise I told them that I had hit someone's fist with my face. They actually said that they could press charges for assault, but I declined. The surgeon (a nurse) was really nice, although dismayed to learn that my brother had gotten stitches just two days earlier (see 'Stitches and Scores'). We were out of the hospital less than an hour after we walked in and went for ice cream before heading home to sleep. My three stitches come out Monday, and I currently have a black eye.  Feeling better and life is back to normal. Re-applying for permit tomorrow, going to TMBG with John, Reuven, and the other mammals, and possibly seeing Laura on Sunday.  Almost makes me forget that my mom's sister's are arriving Sunday night.  Any and all comments welcomed.

      Guess who's brother actually cut himself witha pair of scissors? Justin! Now, you may say to yourself, "Well, that's understandable enough, anybody could accidentally slice a finger or hand while trying to cut something." Well, Justin wasn't cutting anything.In fact, he was walking. To the bathroom. And he somehow managed to slip and slice the top of his left wrist. Smoothmuch. Anyway, he had to go in for three stitches, whereupon I was picked up from work (work being somewhat close to the hospitaling).  So, I arrive home to AP scores, which was quite the mixed bag. Of the four scores, two were roughly what I expected, one was below, and one was above. But I passed, so life can go on.  Five days to the TMBGing...  Everyone I know is on the livejournal. My lack of conformity really does make me feel inferior.

      How awesome is my job? I should be working, but I have no more actual work to do, so I've been essentially ordered to goof around (and get paid for it) for a few hours. Woooooooooot :-D. I'm valiently trying to be useful by copying CDs to the network, but all I have to do is put in the disk and wait for 5 minutes while it copies it. Speaking of which, I think its time for a new disk...There we go, I now have 5 more free minutes.  Anydirection, I suppose I should do something useful for anyone who bothers to stumble into my neck of the hundred-terabyte wood of blogs. So:  Use  urlLink Mozilla Firefox  instead of Internet Explorer. Just trust me on this. It's not at all complicated, it automatically blocks all pop-ups, it has tabbed browsing (unbelievably awesome), it's prettier, it's really customizable (I use Gmail and Winamp extensions, a prettyful skin, and a nifty RSS feed), and most importantly IT'S VIRTUALLY IMMUNE TO VIRUSES (unlike the insecure and extremely virus-prone Internet Explorer, which the Computer Emergency Response Team has denounced). Did I mention that it's up to 80% less evil? It's true. There was a study.  Oh, use  urlLink Winamp 5  for all things media. It's worth it just for the visualizations. :-).  Dance instead of walking.  Inventicize wordlings whentime feelsgood.

      Life: Pretty good. I like the new job I started last week. This font: I'm not liking. Gonna have to fix that.   There we go. Bradley Hand ITC. Good stuff.  So, my job. I'm basically a lackey in the IT department...I need to eat breakfast. This post to be finished in a bit...  That was funesque. For the third and finalish time, IT lackey==good. Pay is said to be excellent and I keep finishing work faster than they can find it. I've been building computers since Thursday and have about , um, 15 so far. This is awesome. I'm getting paid to hang around computers and fix other people's tech problems. It's like being at home, only better. And they have cooler LCD screens and always-available bad coffee. And the occasional pie.  My bosses are Jay Victor (to avoid confusion, everyone now calls me "Jie" except for Jay, because he doesn't speak in the third person to himself), a twenty-something hockey player, IT guy, maker of bad jokes, and neat freak, and John Lee, who might or might not be a  urlLink supertaster . Old guy, lame jokes, fun. There's also this guy named 'Kevin' but I haven't really seen much of him and he's never really given me anything to do. Anyway, it's a good job and it gives me stuff to do (and when it doesn't I'm supposed to goof around online, Jay's orders).    Oh, got to date yesterday. Well, not really, but I got to pull weeds with the Felleys for a few hours. Eh, CAS hours are CAS hours. And I got a really good dinner and brownies afterwards. And Monty Python watching.  TMBG should be coming soon. Lemme check on that...Holy Close Relation of Excrement!(tm) it's on Saturday! I gotta get back to  urlLink John  on that...  That's all I can think of right now. I gotta finish that Costa Rica posting...

       urlLink Guess who has 3D glasses?  This guy! Did you know that winamp visualizations can be viewed in blue-red lens 3D! Drugs for my eyes!!!  In other news, Mongolian BBQ has been had last night with Sam, John, Willa, Ilana and JP. Afterwords there was random walking, bookstoredness with musicsuchness (whereupon I acquired a Spine - 3*bleem points for the reference). Then there was ice cream and a lively debate with a Nader signature gatherer which ultimatley included Woodorw Wilson, the Bull-Moose party, Asian colonialism, tax policy, the nature of choice, the ultimate significance and purpose of voting, and such. Then John and I debated Lizzie's proposal to send 'feminist missionaires' to third world countries promoting equal rights and societal treatment for women, which John though might amount to cultural imperialism. The debate promtly collapsed when John made some atrocious metaphor about "coating an entire tree with pesticide but leaving one bee-hive on one branch untouched". On the upside, Willa still loves us both.  This morning there was violence at the office where John's dad works. Apparently there's blood and the reporter who was supposed to be there isn't. His mom blames the AP. Heh.  One bit of positive news: I just ordered 20 bags of coffee. Oh, and I got my paycheck.  And I have 3D glasses.
