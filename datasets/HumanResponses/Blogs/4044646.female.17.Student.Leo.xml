      Wow i had fun at the Nickle Back, 3Doors Down & Puddle of Mudd concert last night its was awesome. You have to love the rain for one lol cause me and my friend got soaked eventhough we were under the covered seating area it was fun though.... at times i wished i were one of those people with the lawn seating so that i could go down these peoples' tarp and go slip and sliding down the Hill, lmao it looked fun. Oh you know those individualy wrapped promotional WinterFresh pieces of gum? Well as soon as we walked through the gates this chick with 106.1 was giving out hand fulls of it, well i had a Mcdonalds bag from "dinner" and she filled up that bag half way up lol! But suckie part was that when it rained, the bag got wet and it practicly melted lol and fell apart in our hands so i was scramblin to pick most of it up and crammed it into my pockets. The concerts were great.. i was amazed by 3Doors Down and there opening hit "Duck and Run" with all the fire and explosions... it was cool then later on they used light beams and a video wall to view the music video while they were singing... But I think the most amusing thing there was this lil boy who was about 8-10 years old lmao he knew every song was head bangin' the whole works haha and even when Puddle of Mudd was on it was F this F that hahaha im not sure he  repeated any of that but i think he kinda edited it out himself lmao it was funny.... Then the worst part is ( no not the rain) but this couple who couldnt sit still and watch the concert.. every break inbetween the concerts one or both of them would get up and go get another beer.. i swear they only saw 3/4 of the whole concert ... tisk tisk... Nickleback was awesome too... lol yeah I think i was yelling/screaming, and sang to much cause yeah i lost my voice and yeah lmao that wasnt a good thing to have while at marching camp.. but hey i tried yelling as loud as i could (but it hurt like hell) you know what i dont get.. why people come and watch us teach/rehearse i mean there upperclassmen who just sat there today while it drizzled and rained on us all morning.. i ono thought it was kinda stupid... but i had a good day afterwards when i got home... fixed a pizza and put in a movie then went to sleep for about 2hrs maybe a lil bit longer so that felt really good cause i didnt get back home till 12 last night and i was soakin wet, tired ,no voice, knees hurtin, head pounding.. lol but hey i had a great time... plus i just couldnt pass up getting a shirt which was 30fricken bucks and then rachel didnt have enough money so i had to give her 15more$ so im like broke now... but then in return i get $70 from her for the ticket and the shirt woohoo lol

      Yay today's friday, wow this weeks gone by fast.. freshman camp started wed. then the concert ROCK ON!! now its like wow its friday, freshman camps over so that means summer band offically starts monday (yay..Not)joy... lol but yeah today was good... we got a lot done and im pretty much wore out.. i dont feel tired mentally but my muscles are tired and sore, yup well i just got home a few minutes ago, me and Rachel went to their resturant and had lunch and chatted for awhile LOL OMG that song by the blood hound gang ( dunno the name of the song) but the one their mostly known for.. yeah lol it cracks me up everytime i hear it. But yeah lol that was kinda random there lol... You know what we have this new director, Mr.Downs... well hes a pretty cool guy but i've noticed that hes been starring at me and is always watching me..(kinda freaky) then he gives me this half smile/grin then walks away... i cant wait for this weekend so that i can get out and relax before the real stress kicks in next week. For those who were or are in band, we do this excercise to stretch out sides and turn our shoulders flat against the "side lines"... but newayz well we learned a new way to do this and we have to hold out arms out to the sides in "airplane" style and keep them up throughout the entire excercise... geeze i thought my shoulders were gunna fall off afterwards lol im not jokin it hurt... i mean i have enough problems with my shoulders and crap its like what more can i do to screw em' up...welp im runnin out of things to say for the moment so yeah im leavin..

      yeah as you can probably tell im really bored today and that i dont have much else to do today except mope around and sit at the computer...  but newho theres still no one online to talk to and if there is they're not talking to me.. today's been a very slow day.. i guess because i havent really done anything but i did go to the movies but still i was just sitting in a different environment and spend about $15, tried playing nintedo but that got old playing by yourself. A nap sounded nice too, but heh that did work either.. I guess cause im sick and feel like chit that its makin me not feel satisfied with anything that i do... ive been losing my appetite the past few days also.. maybe thats a good thing so that i dont pig out on junk but then its probably a bad thing cuz im not eating... i ono its a pain.... Right now im listening to a mix of Vertical Horizon, Ozzmosis, Blink 182, Oleander, and NickleBack.... then watching Lethal Weapon 2 and yeah well being online... yup im multitasking lol.. *sigh* its been a long lonely/depressing and shitting feeling day...

      Well this mornings starting off swell, its seems as if im getting sick afterall... i just kept thinkin that i lost my voice due to the concert last wednesday.... but as the days went by i began to get a runny nose and sneezing... so yay im getting sick now!!! grrr... but im hoping that its not going to stop me from getting out and doing stuff this weekend cause yeah i need to get out while i can. I tried to sleep in this morning cause i new that i need the rest but that didnt work out to well, i woke up at about 7:30 then fell back asleep for another hour then had to get up to go pee... then i was like screw it i cant get back to sleep so i sat up in bed and watched spongebob for about 30min.... and now its Ed Edd N'Eddy lol and after thats over who knows what i'll do. my parents are outside digging up sod for the paving stones we're putting down to make a walk way to the house since there's not any room to walk by all the cars... so yay.. most likely i'll force myself to go help eventhough i feel like shit right now... and then eventually make myself more sore for monday joy.. lol We've been babysitting my uncles lil chihuahua (hes soo cute) he a tea cup breed.. so tiny... hes like a mirror image of Bambi :) but we've kept him since last Friday and hes comming back sometime today to get him  :( newho im gunna watch my cartoons for awhile then maybe post some more stuff later on...  *in the words of Ed " CHICKEN"!!!!!!

I did go to Walgreens to buy a sun visor for my truck which ive been looking for this whole summer... then went and bought some tea from Chicken Express.... that was my great outing for the day... now i get to look forward to waking up and going to summer band tomorrow morning...  grr this weeked sucked ass...

      Well today i woke up about the same time as yesterday (8:30) and sat up and watchid tv then sat around the house, well i had the intention of going out to lunch with a friend as a late birthday "gift" and so i've been pondering online thinking okay are we going? is he going to call? No, I called his house and i figured right and he's still asleep so now it's the question of whether or not i should eat lunch here at home or wait to see if he gets up thinking "Wait im supposed to be doing something this weekend" According to his mom he was up playin videe games all night and into this morning... I'm kinda thinking he forgot about today and was sucked into game mode.... and so now here I am again with nothing to go do, I've already played nes that got borring... I hate the summer heat.. i mean i guess it wouldnt be so bad if i didnt have to stand&march out in it everyday... yuck* its nice for those who can enjoy the summer and swim all day and lay out in the sun and not break out into a soaking sweat.. *sigh* im glad this my last year of band otherwise I thnk i would've quit by now... Hmm.. this has been yet another waste of a day and then joy summer band starts up tomorrow from 8-4pm everyday.. I hope i get over this crap ive got cause i feel really crappy and i have to get rid of it so that my voice can come back... not a good thing to be in band and then loose your voice... but newho my stomaches rumbling and growling now.. and i still dont know what i should do..?       GRRRRR!!!!! sry that was my stomache

      Well today was an exciting day.... everything was all fine and dandy until I went to get some lunch and was on my way home to change clothes and rest for a few minutes before we had to be at school for practice... well i was almost home when my tire blew and scared the shit out me... I had no idea on what to do... luckily i was infront of the RaceTrac so i walked across the street to use the pay phone, well they didnt work so im like well shit now what so i went inside and they let me use a phone inside... so i called my mom and she called my dad... so i had to wait for about 20-30 mintues for him to show up... Then it took another 30 minutes to change the tire... so yah i was about an 1hour late to rehearsal... and so now i have 2 messed up tires from something in the road and the lovely curb which scrapped my back right tire and put a buldge in it.. so yeah this is gunna suck cause its going to be a pain trying to get back and forth to school... But on other news, im great fortunately due to my accident... sore and tired.. im just ready for this week to be over and done with, the heat mostly... *sigh* well i think im done for now.. still a lil upset from this afternoon but i'll be okay..  *Kaplooey*

      Welp Im back sry guys that I haven't blogged in a few days band craps gotten in the way and I've been to tired to write anything. But since i've mentioned band I might as well talk about it..... it's going well we've learned half the opener already and know some visuals which will be cool if everyone does them right.. musics okay can be better the brass is still behind with knowing their music where as woodwinds are doing well for the skill level of the music. and yeah I dunno what else to talk about already cause my eyes are slowly starting to drop eventhough I not mentally tired....hum yeah there's supposed to be a meteor shower tonight from 2-6am... I really want to go out and see it but im afraid once I do fall asleep, that it will be extremely difficult to get up and then not be able to see anything.... so I dunno about that just yet.... You know what guys are jerks.. yeah and 99.9% of the time they know they are too and dont give a shit about it either.... I think it's because they don't want other males noticing that softer side they have and always have to show that macho alpha male crap... pffftt yeah right thats what makes them so cool.. NOT.. lol welp yeah this has been some major random crap this evening and now I think im going to go to bed now....  peace out!

      Well today was the end of summer band, yay finally.... but then schools just around the corner. I didnt do much today, had band  rehearsal this morning then took pictures and then showed the freshmen around the school... I was supposed to go to this movtivational leadership clinic with all the section leaders afterwards but my parents had some issues with it.. For one Mr.Monroe didnt seem too organized with this because he didnt send any information to us or to our parents explaing what we would be doing, pay $20 to go; then have to make arrangements to get yourself to highland park in friday afternoon traffic in a caravan of student drivers who dont really know where they're going.. so nevertheless my parents weren't to thrilled about this whole sitaution and so i didnt have to go. But im kinda glad that I didnt go cause I go some time to relax and go out and eat with angie, lol and stare at our cute waiter... but after that I didnt do anything but come home and wait around for everyone to get back.... and yeah ive been kinda doing that this whole time and will probably end up leaving then going to sleep. Then its play time at the anual band picnic... so that ought to be fun.. yeah right doubt that.. but neways im gunna go now.. talk to yas later

      Yeah school started up today... it wasnt to bad but the 1st few days are lame and borring. But went throught the usual in everyclass... fill this out, lets talk about this, whats your name...yatta yatta yatta..meh then the occasional 1st group assignment... lol but i know one things for sure.. Im not going to have to worry about the difficulty of the classes. Lunch was a new experience; you see they've down sized the portioning of the food so you if you wish to buy fries you get about half the normal amount, and what gets me is they keep the price the same eventhough your getting less??? I ono plus they've changed the dress code.. see now anything thats seen as "gang" related is not alowed to be worn like for an example: colored shoe laces, hoodies or any thing with hoods in generall... i dunno this whole thing sucks already... But It was funny when I went to go sit in senior patio.. you see the cafeteria's pretty packed and so the freshmen see this whole area untouched and think they can sit there... well no not possible cause thats reseved for seniors only so it felt great telling the fish they cant sit there and they have to move.. ahh the powers of being a senior, lol... that was the highlight of my day, lol but newho im about to eat dinner so i'll see yalls lata  audios

      Well its the 3rd day of school, everythings been going fine for now i guess. Classes dont seem to be a huge problem right now, many laid back and not too stressful which is great. But then I guess the thing thats been on my mind the most is something I should've gotten over a long time ago but I guess it was something I thought would be great and well turned into a pile of crap... everytime I see him now I think about kicking his ass and then slap some common sense into him.. I mean what is he thinking when he makes his decisions?? "Oh It's time to spin the bottle again"... that's how his mind works... doesnt care about much except how she looks.. yeah im sure it would be nice to have a skinny and petit body, but what of those who aren't blessed with that? Those I mean myself, its not that I dont wish to loose weight and gain more muscle mass... I would do anything to build that up, but Im not really complaining about how I look cause Im happy for the strengths that i've got now and whats to come with it.I dunno I guess im just in kind of a gloomy stage inside but then on the outside it doesnt seem to be as noticeable unless your some psychic and can see right through me...(weirdo) lol but yeah Im going to try to not let any of this get to me and effect me....   *Meh*.... lol
