      im so excited we are all on now. i dont know why that stupid email was being so difficult booo! so ange and meg on the go train i got harassed by this hyped up JC preacher...i finally had to be rude and tell him that i was not interested in his 'message' it was so embarassing and angry (he told me that i looked empty and that i looked hungry for some soul food) that made me mad grrrrrrrrrr. but damn funny now that i think about it. to im heading to calgary in the morn. looks like there will be some white water rafting on the agenda. a lunch with andy. some banff. some lake louise. some hockey on 17th ave. and a few nights out. im looking foward to it. im bringing the digi so you guys can all see the pics (hahaha arent you excited!!) hope all is well with everyone. talk to you later love lindsay

      Hey Ladies!  Compliment to you all in how much I like you,I am writing on this page. We all know computers and complicated bloggies are Ali's favourite haha.   So the real world blows, I feel like a turtle. Want to get in my carapasse and turtle inwards. Hate the friends, hate living at home, hate a real job haha. I am playing rugby which is cool, still waiting to hear about the hospital job.   Bottom line, bubble is best and I feel like Billy Madisson when he squeezes that fat kids face "Never ever ever leave". boooo.   Ps Ange member that time you started to barf and without thinking I put out my hand? My inability to deal with gross shit and my skill on the power saw (mastered at the cottage with han and my cousin building a bar while wasted) have deemed me a good doctor. Now I just have to master the bullshit science.   I have big plans to seduce a pretty rugby boy. I will let you all know.   Ps when is Florida happening already?  Signing out,  Sausage Toes Tortue

      three things about taking the Go train home... one: make sure to check the time of the train. (i was waiting at union for over an hour haha fabulous...) two: make sure you buy the right ticket and are prepared to talk your way out of a 110 ticket three: make sure you dont have to take the bus home...too many high school memories flooding back loved thurs in TO. loved new boys to look at. loved new boys to dance with. i love boys. BUT loved hanging out with the girls even more. were fun. hahaha.need to work on the late night pizza hours... im spending this week in courtice (ange and meg i will call you) and im off to calgary june 1st until the 8th. but ill talk to all of you before then!  xo linz

      Ok... so our rugby nite out in T.O was a sucess. $0.50 drafts are dangerous    Beany/Linser:(re-cap)so we all got retarded...  Ali (Ange's mother for the nite) rip'd it up randomly with everyone (cus she didn't remember ANYONE's name in the morning)then showed up @ McD's in the morn (picture this)with red basketball shorts on, a belly top tshirt, itty jean jacket, AND red HIGH HEALS! (I topped off the outfit with a nice plastic McD's bib!)  Linz says she only had 2 beers (sure ya did ;)) but took control of the dance floor and all our boys loved her.  And of course.. the ground beef at 4am definitely inhanced her gastric abilities!!!  The ster(ange)... wow... the ster.  She really lit it up, rounded up the troops for our second destination of the nite, apparently signed up for a women's rugby league ("No really have to play tuesday"), randomly takes a shot with 'Green Mile' guy which puts her over the edge, decides to puke in Ali's hand once we get home, and falls of the couch ASLEEP on to the hardwood floor!(never woke up)  Han worked it like it was her job ;)(till about 5:19am), the new do, the sassy outfit, what more could Marty ask for?  Although the senorita boots weren't doing so well on the feet, she managed to play musical boots with linz the entire nite.  The draft was going down so well that nite but she paid for it in the morn (sicker than a dog).  And little old me... got a little tipsy, danced up a storm, made-out with a buddy (Beetham) and now will forever get razzed about it anytime I see Bridge or any of his buddies.  Whatever.. all in good fun, and have had a crush on him forever.    All in all... my girlfriends ROCK. I love you kids.  See ya's soon xoxo meggie

      so i headed to the shwa on friday to celebrate megans 23rd birthday. first off ethan is as cute as all his pictures and more.  so meg and i had some eats at joe alfredos then picked up erin and got on the booze train...and did we ever. i can only speak for meg and i but we were hammered like the best of times. we got to the firkin when meg was at her peek of her drunken messiness...her bankcard wasnt working/she was too drunk to use the machine i think...she spilled her beer within the first two minutes of getting it. dropped the contents of her purse on the floor including her new digital camera...nothing broke except for her compact (face powder everywhere...) erin and i went into a fit of laughter and i do believe i was snorting and hyperventalating...we went over to the lava lounge after and danced er up. i had bridge on the dance floor for most of the night it was a wicked time. i kep piling back the drinks at the bar though...whoopsies...bridge. meg and i went back and had a hottub in the pouring rain...im not sure why...then meg insisted that the three of us needed to sleep in one bed together...i have now discovered why meg doesnt sleep in the same bed as other people...CUZ SHE TAKES THE ENTIRE THING OVER...she had more room than mike and i combined...WORST...we didnt sleep...while megan was well rested enough in the am to leave for the cottage by 9:30...we went back to sleep until noon...MEG IS THE WORST BED-SHARER EVER!!!!!!!!...but she did leave me mini-bretons in the morning hahaha... all in all it was an awesome birthday (one that she will remember more clearly than her 21st i do believe) thats my side of the story...i wonder if megans is any different...hahahahaha love lindsay

      Ladies,   I have been slacking on the bloggs. Sorry. Keep forgetting.   News...well I am still waiting to hear from Curves. So I am not working. And the Chaunce wont lay off. I might have to shoot her soon. I am finally finished all my chores and shit from Fric, mailing stuff to people, credit card paying etc, back on health care. So now I am ready to work it up.  I am filling my days with redoing the phone book for 20 bucks...man that is sad city.   I am playing rugby with a wicked team. Had my first game, they unfortunately put me as a back, inside center, which I have never played before. I did quite well but it was hilarious. I got worked in a tackle, and smashed my knee pretty badly. Its really bruised and I cant walk so well. Walk it off Bramwell, Im sure tonight's practice will be great for it. My teammate just got picked to be the captain of Team Canada in the Worlds which is going on right now. Woohoo.   The frieds at home are good. But I do feel like a bit of an outsider. They all laugh about inside jokes, and Im that lurker laughing outside the circle haha. Trying to fit in socially, and physically with rugby is hilarious.   Got to see Mark and Sacha and Andrea, which is nice. Had a wicked match of Pictionnary.   Hopefully my Curves training will be this week and then I can start working and do my volunteering and rugby around it.   Think I am going to visit my high school tommorow for the first time in 5 years ahah.  Went to Jen's McGill grad...so sucked compared to Acadia's. Couldnt even see anything. But we went to eat at the Ritz Carelton which is shi shi and we had a nice party bar bq later.  Bore's mum got all drunk and the parents were giving wasted speaches ahha. hilarious. Her mom left with a bag of chips upstairs at like 11 and we never saw her again haha.   Some cute rugby boys but as I learnt from the first scandal I was involved in (stepping on someone's toes unintentionally), dont date within the rate cage. Not a good idea....so we are looking elsewhere.   So far...summer blows. So much pressure on me to "find a job, find a career", "what is she doing in the fall"....BLOW ME! ahah  It will all work out, but for now, I might shave Chaunce's head at night.   Miss you girls, and sooo miss the bubble comfort of school.   Baboos
