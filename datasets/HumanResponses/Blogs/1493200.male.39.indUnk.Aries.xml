      hey, peeps, just heard today that that accursed "president" of ours' tax cut bill is giving tax credits to all sorts of parents *except* the poor who actually *need* it.  how stupid can you get?  and this from a "president" who claims he won't leave a single child behind??  well, at least the democrats are many of them in an uproar about it, which counts for something.  but how can we get rid of w. and his filthy crew?  and *why* on earth is w. seemingly so popular?  it makes *no* sense at all.  *none*!!  it makes me feel sick.

      'k, peeps, just learned that The Hunger Site etc. only counts one click per person per day maximum per site of the five, so i've been clicking foolishly for a while today, but oh well.  it's still worth while.  it's just a few mouse clicks to help out all those causes a little bit, and it's still free.  i just have to remember to click them every day, but they're willing to send you reminders to do that.

      hey, peeps, just added a new link!  *please*, every single day click on the link to The Hunger Site.  there, completely free of charge to you, you can click on a link which gives food to the hungry!  also there are tabs at the top of that page which take you to four other charity sites where you can do the same kind of thing!  i'm making it a practice, at least once a day, to go to all those five sites (all accessible, remember, from The Hunger Site) and click on each of those five links 108 times, being one mala's worth of clicks.  i've also become a Friend of each of those five sites, for $30 each, which doubles (or in the case of The Rainforest Site *triples*) the amount of money i call down from their sponsors for each click at each of those sites!  it's a wonderful way to do charitable giving, especially seeing as it costs you nothing unless you choose to become a Friend of one or more of those five sites.  it's free!  it's good!  it only costs you a click of your mouse, a *tiny* little effort!  you can help, and help genuinely and easily!  *please*, do this, for the sake of the Living Good.  *thank* you, all of you who do this to any degree at all.  one site feeds the hungry, another gives free mammograms to underprivileged women, another takes care of children's health, another preserves our rainforests, and the fifth feeds rescued animals, all of which are worthy causes in my book.  i think their idea of arranging for calling down money from their sponsors is brilliant!  but they need your mouse click or it won't work!

i luv u, my reader my friend, never forget that.  accept my gift to you of the gift of giving easily.

      hey, peeps, just gotta plug isometrics again...  didn't do my other exercise today, since i had a migraine, but isometrics i could do.  very handy stuff, isometrics.

      hey, peeps, migraine day today.  didn't even exercise!  but that's over.

i'm watching "spider-man," which is fairly cool for various reasons, including toby maguire's cuteness.  elijah wood's more my type though, and he's a bit older than he looks, too.  and he's short.  and i'm short too.  this is appealing.  but so are taller guys often.  i'm not too fussy in that connection.  the important things are that we love each other, are attracted to each other and fit together as people like hand in glove.  oh, and that we find each other soon of course.  did i ever tell you i'm available?  that i'm available right now?  like, this very minute? :}

i think i'll listen to the radio for a bit, then go back to the flick.  i luv u, my reader my friend, and don't forget that.  l8rz...

      hey, peeps, you know what?  i really honestly deserve all that love i need.  yeah, i'm a little guy -- actually that's part of my cuteness! (see my pic.)  and i'm a very loving guy and a very good guy and a very intelligent guy and a very sincere guy and i'm very determined to set the whole world right and all that very good stuff, very.  i take good care of myself, with a good vegetarian diet and plenty of exercise and meditation for instance.  the only things that are holding me back from doing some of the things i need to do are a mysterious pain problem and lack of the wonderful beautiful (inside and out) boyfriend i so very much deserve.  the pain problem is strictly temporary, and after all it's only pain.  i can still function.  and anyway i have my will set to the "perfect health" setting, so therefore i will be pain-free, and *soon*!!  and no *way* am i going to let it stand between my boyfriend and me, once he and i find each other, which is gonna be *soon* i vow.

i luv u, my reader my friend.  {smooch}  l8rz...

      hey all.  just wakin up, havin my coffee, waiting for a painkiller to take effect and contemplating my beloved treadmill.  damn!  i didn't even use the rowing machine at *all* yesterday!  shape up, david, shape up, 'cause there's no such thing as shipping out.  of course though, one day away from the rowing machine once in a long while isn't going to make your body go all to pot.  that's a matter of having an *educated* conscience.  conscience is a good thing, but only if it's healthy and educated.  otherwise it causes all sorts of hellish problems for people, doing nothing better than making them feel bad, totally uselessly.  an *educated* conscience makes you focus *not* on feeling bad, but on solving the problem in the most practical way.  *that's* the kind of conscience i want, and no other kind.  some people's "consciences" make them feel like they have to do all sorts of really awful harmful things.  that kind of "conscience" is really not worthy of the name, but people still call it that.  how stupid.  or rather, ignorant, to be sure, and uneducated, to be fair.  it's noone's fault really though, none of it.  we all do what we think is the best thing to do, even if we might not *think* we think it's the best, on the surface.  and we have all sorts of unrealistic ideas of what's possible, so we blame ourselves and each other for things that we never could have avoided under the circumstances, or for not doing things that we never could really have done under the circumstances -- including psychological circumstances beyond our control at the time.  we have both more and less control over things than most of us seem to realize.  it's really sad how uneducated people seem to be about the reality of their own natures.  one big thing i plan to do with my life is to teach people how things *really* are, to the extent that i know it, which frankly is more than most people seem to know about it.  i want to make people happy and at peace, and i *know* i can do it.  i want to make *you* happy and at peace, dear reader dear friend, and i vow to do my best, so please keep checking in here.  and give me *feedback*!  i didn't put an "email david" button on the page for nothing!

one thing people really need to be as happy as they can be is to be in good physical health, including being in good physical shape.  this isn't only a matter of physical well-being.  we're more or less integrated systems, spiritual, mental and physical, and keeping your body in good shape *really* does help you be in good mental and spiritual shape, all else being amenable.  and there are things almost *anyone* can do to get themselves into and keep themselves in some kind of decent physical shape, like a good well-balanced vegetarian diet, and exercise as simple as isometrics!  isometrics i can hardly recommend enough!  they *don't* take loads of time -- a full isometric workout can be done in under two minutes a day for serious benefit, especially if you do them consistently over time.  they *don't* take any specialized equipment, and no equipment at all that you're not likely to have around your place already, things like walls and doorways and beds and chairs -- so you can do them practically anywhere under a huge variety of circumstances.

the isometrics book i'm working with is vic obeck's "how to exercise without moving a muscle," copyright 1964 by pocket books.  it's inspiring, it's got great illustrations (i think i'm in love with obeck's son steve, who appears frequently in the illustrations -- he just looks so cleancut and nice and *good*, though he's too young for me, in the pictures anyway [he must be in his mid fifties by now in real life], except for the simple friendship i really love having with young people, who respect my intelligence and my being generally such a solidly good guy) and it's short and well-written.  it's also amusing to read something that's so representative of a 50s-early 60s mentality.  i recommend it if you can still get hold of it somehow.  otherwise there must be plenty of other isometrics books out there to be had.

'k, i'm out for now.  l8rz, peeps...

      hi.  i think people need to get into better shape.  we've got a big flabbiness problem in this country.  i recommend isometrics, because they're so easy, require so little (even nothing) in the way of special equipment, they take so little time to do (like a couple of minutes or so to exercise all your major muscle groups) and they strengthen and tone the muscles so efficiently!  there're probably lots of good books on the subject out there.  the one i'm using now is from the 1960s, a book my dad gave me, and i'm sure it's not outdated.  this book gives a series of fifteen exercises (one version for men, one for women, though each could benefit from both) which exercise all the major muscle groups over a total of 90 seconds, six seconds per exercise (plus the time to shift from one exercise to another).  the only equipment any of these require, beyond your body itself, is stuff like your bed, a wall, a heavy desk, a door frame and stuff like that that you're likely to have anyway.  do isometrics for 90 seconds a day and your strength and muscle tone should increase by five percent a week, which is pretty good considering the amount of time involved.  and of course nothing's stopping you from doing your isometrics more than once per day either, which i imagine would speed up all the benefits.  of course if you have an injury or any of a number of illnesses you should check with your doctor before doing any kind of exercise.  for my part, i've decided to do at least the 90 seconds of exercises for men every day from now on, in addition to the treadmill and the rowing machine half an hour each per day.  those should probably be enough to get me in really beautiful shape, though i'd like to do weight training eventually in addition.  nuf for now.  l8rz...

      'k, peeps, i've changed the "contact" button into an "email david" button and removed some links that blogger automatically put in that i just don't need to have on my site.  i need to learn html, dammit...  but i'm a quick study, so that's okay.  just did my exercise for the morning, half an hour on the treadmill.  yesterday i got the rowing machine taken up from the basement and put in my bedroom, and started using it.  the treadmill is fine for my legs and for general cardiovascular training and weight loss, but the rowing machine will help me with my arms and upper body generally.  like i say, i'm gonna get myself into top physical shape.  plus i'll start doing isometric exercises today too, and i expect to start doing some weight training sometime soonish.  and once i get myself into top physical condition i'm gonna keep that up for the rest of my life, make a lifelong habit of it.  whatever boyfriend/s i have along the way will be pleased, and besides i'll just feel better in every relevant way.  have i told you that i'm very available right now?  anyway, blog atcha l8r.  i luv u,  my readers my friends.

      well, i said i'd letcha know...  i didn't do any of that.  i fell asleep in my chair instead, hehe.  think i'll use the treadmill soon.  i'm gonna get myself into top shape, for health reasons and for the sake of my boyfriend-to-be, whoever he turns out to be.  i was very sedentary for a while there, what with the pain situation and all.  but since using the treadmill over the last few months the spare pounds (there weren't that many of them really either) have been dropping away at a good rapid but healthy pace and i'm feeling much stronger and better.  i do half an hour on the treadmill every day, pain permitting, which means six days a week or so on average so far, which is pretty good.  and i'm slowly increasing the difficulty.

piece of advice:  if you've been sedentary for a while, and have use of a treadmill, do what i did.  i started with just five minutes at an easy difficulty level, and increased my time by thirty seconds per day until i reached half an hour.  i kept it *easy* all along the way, and that made a huge difference to my keeping it up.  because it was easy enough all along to feel good, it kept me inclined to do the exercise to begin with.  this is important.  exercise should be pleasant and fun.  if it's not, then maybe you're doing the wrong exercise or are pushing yourself too fast.

i'm looking forward to starting to use the rowing machine we have buried somewhere.  i was a coxswain for freshman crew at harvard, so rowing is something i know and have good memories of.  plus it exercises more muscles than just the treadmill does.  i'm gonna get my whole body in top shape and the rowing machine should be fun to use.  once in college i did 150 miles at a stretch on a rowing machine.  impressed the hell out of my rowers.  i was just a little coxswain after all.

i luv u, my readers my friends.  never forget that.  l8r...

      dear reader my friend, what do we humans really know about especially the long-term effects of all these artificial junks we create?  we weren't evolved to know how to deal with them.  that goes for artificial food additives, other stupid sorts of chemicals, genetically modified foods and organisms, etc.  one of the stupidest things we're doing is tampering with organisms' genetics.  "life will find a way," to quote from "jurassic park," and it's just plain dangerous!  we honestly only *imagine* we know what we're doing when we do that.  we *don't* know the long-term effects of these g.m. organisms upon the ecosystem long-term.  nor do we know the long-term effects upon it of the various new chemicals we produce and dump everywhere.  why are we so blind and unthinking and even uncaring?  it makes no sense.  it's poisonous attitudes that are to blame, of course, things like greedy attachment, malice and (especially willful) ignorance, pride, superstition, and all those, which are called "kleshas" in buddhism.  according to buddhism these kleshas have been with us, partially dominating us, from beginningless time.  personally i don't think it's worth blaming anyone, because it's only that we've been dominated by these bad patterns which we *wouldn't* allow ourselves to be dominated by if we were *really* aware of their effects upon our happiness and suffering levels.  we need to clear our judgments from these bad patterns if we are to overcome them, which we definitely *can* do.  some people have done it thoroughly, some people more partially, but it *can* be done and it *must* be done, by humanity en masse and generally by all sentient beings en masse throughout the universe/multiverse/all.  it's a big task, but i vow to you that it shall be done.  then we'll have a permanent golden age in real life.  i vow it to you.  nothing is ultimately more important to me than accomplishing that and then enjoying the results forever.  it's a serious vow, so hold me to it (in a reasonable fashion of course).  i've found that the best sources of information about the nature of reality which are practical for building *real* personal strict knowledge upon are theosophy, buddhism, and modern science, in terms of overcoming blindness and the kleshas in general and coming to know the reality of our situation firsthand.  some of the results are in my certain experience surprising and strange, especially how very psychological natural processes generally seem to be.  mind is heavily involved in every phenomenon which has any meaningful existence, and it can be quite surprising to have true revelations about this.  and it can be highly *useful* to come to know this stuff firsthand, i know from my own experience.  it's a universe of *living* energy/matter/sensation which is gradually learning how to make itself (all of us, that is) thoroughly happy.  our happiness (its happiness) is most definitely the one central aim of it all.  even our blunders we make imagining they'll make us happier.  because the whole thing shares a wish for perfect (implying unalloyed and permanent) happiness, and because it's developing better and better intelligence, and because some beings have already achieved their individual perfections, there's real hope for us all in the long run, very real actual hope for us all to be quite happy together forever someday in actuality.  just think about it, eh?  l8r...

      those financial-type visitors are still here.  i wish they'd leave soon, meaning them no offense, so i can have a good opportunity to have that special little talk with my folks.  i feel a great urgency about this coming out thing all of a sudden, thanks to my old friend turning out to be gay too giving me a sudden burst of courage.  see, i want to do this while this bout of special courage lasts.  that's part of my feeling of urgency.  i think it *will* last anyway, but just to be on the safe side...  i really need to do this for my happiness' sake.

in other news, i've decided to add some more exercises to my workout routine.  currently all i'm doing is 30 minutes on a treadmill every day, which of course is important and a great thing for me to do in and of itself, but i want to add exercises to tone and shape the rest of my muscles too, for health's sake, for beauty's sake, for my potential boyfriends' sake and all that great stuff.  i'll start with some easy isometric exercises to start building my musculature more, then graduate to training with weights soon after that.  of course, i need to actually *get* the weights, but that can be done of course.  all we have at home is a pair of 2-pound hand weights, which isn't much except as a bare start.  i've found this website which has a sort of personalized trainer computer program and descriptions of a bunch of exercises.  i guess when i graduate from isometrics i might start with the few exercises there that don't require weights or machines, especially if i haven't gotten my weights yet to train with.  i'm determined to get my body into top shape, as a good thing in every way.  l8r...

      hey, peeps.  just changed the opening blurb of the blog to reflect a major decision.  i've decided that i want to come out of the closet and live honestly as openly gay.  i'm just waiting for an appropriate moment to tell my parents, then my sister when i see her next, then i'll open things up for anyone to know who wants to know.  congratulate me.  i've needed to do this for years, for my happiness' sake.  i think people will generally be cool with it, even my parents included, though it might take some getting used to for them.  why am i doing this now?  it's because of hearing the other day that a childhood friend of mine is also gay.  this has somehow given me the courage that i need to do this.  'k, i'll go sit in the living room hoping my parents will be available this afternoon or evening for this little talk...  blog atcha l8r.

      woke up a little while ago and took a painkiller, so i'll stay up for a while and blog and stuff while it lasts and sleep later until i can take another one around 8:30-9:00 am.  life with chronic pain...

i miss raves and my raver friends.  i used to hang out with them like all the time.  once two of my raver friends stayed with me for five days at a stretch.  that was when my dad had his first heart attack.  it was nice to have them here to support me.  ravers can be so wonderful, and take care of each other so well...  oh well.  i'll have friends to hang with again soon, i'm sure, once this pain thing is under better control or goes away.  friends are very important to me.  i love my friends dearly.  i'm devoted to them.  i'd live my life for them.  and of course for my boyfriend, once i find him.  and of course for my family.  i guess i'm a very loving person.  not outgoing enough, but very very loving.  and of course there's my great vow, to set everyone in perfect happiness forevermore.  that's a loving vow.  i want to become a completely perfect friend (and lover, for my boyfriend-to-be).  that's one way to describe my highest ideal for myself, to be a perfect friend to every living being, including you my beloved reader friend.  write me or something.  i'm feeling lonely and bored.  sometime also i want some kind of feedback thing built into my blog.  i've just ordered a couple of books from amazon about blogging -- how to set up a really good blog and such stuff.  argh!  i'm bored.  WRITE ME!!  i've had this my first blog up for over 24 HOURS and nobody's written me yet!!  of course i imagine this is kind of normal, but i do have an impatient streak.  i'm an aries after all.  of course, it's not like i've really *told* anyone about my blog yet, so what can i expect, but i did have it linked this afternoon to a glbt blog directory, so who knows what'll come of that.  wonderful things, i hope.  become part of my life, dear reader friend, if you are so inclined.  i mean, how hard can it be to click one little contact button? :)

      Hey, peeps.  Okay, maybe it was a *comparative* success anyway... the sound quality was dull and muddy and way overbalanced toward the bass, and to my sensitive ears it was an effort to make out.  Part of it is that I was sitting farthest from the speakers, but that wasn't the whole thing.  But it's okay.  My dad wanted to make a first success in his project of preserving his father's talks today, on his late father's birthday, so much in the way of sound quality is forgiven.

I think I'll go meditate for a bit now.  I took that minor painkiller dose and I'll wait for it to take effect while I meditate to reduce the pain.  Blog writing distracts me from it though, so that's something.  Gonna beat this thing someday, someday soon.  Then I'll have a real life to report to you, my dear readers/friends.

      Just watched "The Matrix" on DVD.  It just arrived the other day, and I'd caught the last two thirds of it a few days ago on local TV and *boy* had I missed important info in the first part of the movie.  Things made *sense* this time, hehe.  I might go out soon and see the sequel with my sister and her boyfriend, *if* pain levels allow sometime soon.  I'm bored right now, and in pain, and I can't take my painkiller until 8:30-9:00pm other than a minor dose that only dulls the edge of it.  My dad just came in and announced the unveiling of his first successful CD, a recording of a talk his father gave about a Buddhist festival called Wesak, which happened yesterday.  It's his (my late grandfather's) birthday today.  So I must go listen to it.  Blog atcha l8r, peeps.

      Okay, peeps.  Got the "contact" button working.  You can email me by clicking on it now.  I've gotta learn HTML so I can add some stuff to this blog site.  Fortunately I've got a couple of books on the subject to read.  I have a pic of me I want to make available here so you can see how cute I am. :}

      Hi, peeps.  Just had a talk with my mother.  We have a house guest right now, and she's loveable but sometimes seriously unthinking, unintentionally rude, and less than straightforward.  My dad is often seriously annoyed with her, which is unfortunate because my dad is not in the best of health these days.  I do my best to smooth things though, keeping myself calm and wise and supportive and helpful.  I believe in wisdom, deeply.  Wisdom does its best to make and keep us all happy.  Tibetan Buddhism emphasizes the importance of a combination of wisdom (knowledge of reality) and skillful means (love, compassion, and all the appropriate modes of behavior to establish and maintain the best happiness possible).  This appeals to me greatly, as does most of Tantric/Vajrayana Buddhism.  I have several Tantric empowerments, and do a little Tantric meditative practice every day, and of course I'm going to this wonderful lama for help and direction.  He's truly wonderful, and I *know* he's helping me, and I'm determined that he and I and the beings he knows will help me beat this pain problem and have a *life* again, *soon*.  I'm determined.  And when I'm really determined, things happen.  It's time for me to have strong good health, good work, good play, active friendships, an active love life, and all that good stuff.  I need all that, and my having it would make a lot of people I know really happy.  And when all is well, also I won't be bitching here.  I'll have loads of happy stuff to tell you all, my friends, and I'll be able to help you more and better too generally, because I won't be obsessed with my problems.  And you know I love you and *will* help you all, my dear readers/friends, in every good way I can figure.  We already have stuff in common, most centrally the natural and under the circumstances inevitable desire for perfect happiness free from suffering.  I count that as a sufficient basis for some kind or other of friendship.  Friendship is deeply important to me, and I feel awful about being even temporarily isolated from hangin' with my pals.  If you think you might want to be my email penpal or something, just write me.  iwnmutef at earthlink dot net.  iwnmutef is the name of a form of the child Horus, and the name means "pillar of his mother."  I feel a strong connection with Horus, as a deity and as a concept.  He's the one who sets things right when they've gone wrong, and that's what I need and that's something I want to be.  Tibetan Buddhism isn't my only religious connection, you see, though religion to me is subsidiary to the goal of all of our perfect happiness, and should never be considered otherwise.  If religion doesn't serve that, it's false religion, and that's as simple as that.  Religion is meant to serve us, rather than we religion.  People lose sight of that kind of thing like all the time, and that bothers me greatly.  Religion can be a great help, or it can be one of the worst hindrances to happiness.  L8r, peeps.

      Hey, peeps.  Painkillers are kicking in and I feel much better.  And I took some of those incredibly blessed herbs and the blessed water my lama gave me and I feel this wave of love and devotion too.  I'm gonna beat this pain problem, for everyone's happiness' sake.  Including yours, dear reader, so you don't have to suffer my bitching about it forever.  You're just gonna have to forgive me though, 'cause I'll probably be bitching about it until it's gone.

But on to something even cheerier.  It's a beautiful partly-sunny day here in Seattle, and I live in a house with a beautiful garden which is blooming in a lovely way.  It's a pain not having a life, but there are much worse places not to have a life at, that's for sure.  It's a great house too, and I have a sizable separate apartment in it so I can be as isolated or as connected with my parents as I feel like it at any given moment.  And my parents are very supportive and wonderful.  I just wish I were brave enough to come out to them.  They're mostly not the problem here.  They'd understand it just fine.  I'm just a little cowardly about it, and I'm afraid that even though they'd still love me and support me and all they might be a little bit disappointed anyway.  They're very good people.  But they're not perfect yet.  Nor am I.  Oh well, that'll change.  I'll be perfect someday, or otherwise I'll just have to be perfect anyway.  Either way I'm determined to become perfect.  Sure, I'm a bit of an idealist, but it works for me.  And I recommend it to you, too, my friend.  The world needs more idealists, good practical idealists.  Hey, while you're here, let's idealize together!  My email address is at the top of the page, and I want to communicate with my readers, and I'll post whatever seems suitable to the blog too, so we can all figure out together how to make each other happy.  That's the point, after all, for us all to be happy.  Which you'll hear me repeat quite a lot in this blog over time.  Write me!  I have plenty of time these days for email and the blog, and I'll be nice atcha if you're not mean and/or spam me.  I don't like meanness.  And I don't like spam.  But I love people, even mean people and even spammers.  It's bad patterns of behavior I dislike, not any living being per se.  I mean, to be practical, we're all stuck in the same multiverse together forever anyway, and we all want to be happy and not to suffer, so we've all got to learn to make the best of it all and make each other happy.  And in Tibetan Buddhism "love" is defined as the wish for someone to be happy.  Personally, I use the word "love" to cover the Tibetan meaning and also compassion (the wish for someone not to suffer) and kindness generally, and more.  Love, as I define it, is definitely a many-splendoured thing.  So.  Count on it that I love you, 'cause I love all living beings on general principles and in fact.  And you can't possibly make me not love you, so don't even try.  And because we're going to have actual perfection some day (I've vowed it, so that's decisive and definitive) you're going to come to love me if you don't already, so you might as well get a head start.

Okay, I've run out of stuff to say for the moment, so just think about all this stuff and write me if you feel like it, and I'll blog atcha soon!

Love, David.

      Good morning, dear reader my friend.  Or at least pardon me because I'm going to pretend you're my friend.  That's because I think we *all* should be friends, by nature if not in a formal sense necessarily.  By which I mean we all should be looking out for everyone else's best interests at least, all the time.  The world would be a much happier place if we all would just learn to do that.  And it's a simple enough thing to do, in a way, too.  Just develop that attitude, and the way that should work out in practice will just naturally fall into place gradually.

So.  What's new this morning?  I'm waiting to take some very highly blessed herbs this morning, which were given to me by a Tibetan lama with whom I'm beginning to study.  He's wonderful!  He's very practical and a brilliant teacher.  I only wish his English were slightly better, because it takes an effort to understand him sometimes, and I need his assistant to clarify points occasionally.  He knows about my pain problem and is working toward healing it, and I really believe that he has the ability at *least* to help very greatly with it.  I'm gonna *beat* this thing and have a *life* again.  That also is a vow.

In other news, I just learned yesterday that a childhood friend of mine is also gay.  I'm arranging through a mutual friend to get in touch with him via email.  Oh, he's taken, it's nothing like that.  But I have very few gay friends, being so closeted and all, and I would *dearly* love to be back in touch with him and talk about stuff and hopefully develop a deep friendship with him.  I've missed him a lot over the years.  A lot.

I should really come out some day.  Oh, I'm already out to a few friends, but that's all.  It's just that my life has in some respects been very lonely and unhappy here in the closet.  And I deserve better than this, much better indeed.  If nothing else, let this blog be an object lesson in the value of coming out of the closet whenever that's practical.  Don't try the way I've handled this at home because you'll probably make yourself deeply unhappy, as I did.

Get yourself together, David.  Think of something more positive.  I know!  I'll go do my daily exercise (half an hour on a treadmill every day).  That should lift my spirits.  I'll be back, dear reader, hopefully with something more happy and useful to say.  L8r, peeps.

      Hi.  My name's David and this is my first blog and first blog entry.  Here you'll probably over time find out quite a bit about me and the way I think about various subjects.  First off, I'm not giving away my full name straight off 'cause I want to be able to speak freely about *anything* at all without worrying who's going to read this and know who it is.  It's not that my secrets are so deep and dark as all that, it's just that there are things I'll want to say here that I haven't told my family yet for instance, like the fact of my gayness.  Plus, some of my ideas may sound a little weird at first hearing at times.  Plus, I might have the occasional political commentary to give which might not delight the U.S. Attorney General for instance.  And he's scary.  (Damn it, that whole administration is scary.)

Right now I'm living at home in Seattle with my parents with a chronic pain problem which mysteriously appeared and might mysteriously disappear any time.  The docs don't know what it is.  I'm stuck at home basically for the time being, which does cramp my style, but it'll give me plenty of time to blog atcha so it's not all bad, right?  Right.  And you can email me if you want to (iwnmutef at earthlink dot net).  Just be nice, 'k?  And don't spam me, 'cause if you do I'll... I'll... I dunno, delete it or something and feel faintly irritated.

Random idea for you to toy with -- reality is composed only of sensation, order and change/energy.  I'm trying to figure out whether there's anything I've ever known which can't be analyzed into those three components, outside merest imagination (which can be a subtle and even insidious habit, depending on what you're talking about), and I'm having a hard time of it.  Your regular physical object?  I only know it as changing sensation in space (space being an aspect of order) with an additional quality of number (another aspect of order).  Everything else I imagine I know about the object is so far as I can tell purely imagination.  But this is probably crazy, or at least I've forgotten something somewhere or something like that.  But I can't help wondering if matter is only ordered energy yielding sensation upon measurement (and measurement merely a change in sensation-order order via energy/change, with measurement = mental engagement and mind = the set of mental engagements).

But, see what my life has come to?  I actually spend *time* thinking up junk like that.  And it probably is junk, too.  Pardon me, I'm slightly stir-crazy stuck here at home.

So, what can come of blog writing anyway?  I confess I've never even read one yet, though when I'm done here I'm gonna go check out a few for fun.  I want my blog to be *purposeful*, to be *useful*, not merely self-centered bullshit, though there'll probably be a bunch of that along the way here knowing me.  But have blogs changed lives?  Have they brought Enlightenment?  The promise of life-long friendship? or even, dare one hope, love?  I could go for any of that, or a simple increase of happiness.

That's what it's all for, you see.  Happiness.  *Everyone's* happiness.  And happiness free of suffering worthy of the name at that.  Oh, not necessarily bubbly overjoyous happiness, of course.  Happiness comes in many forms.  But it's all for our happiness, and it's our mutual happiness together that's what's worth striving for, you and me.  People lose sight of that pretty easily, but think about it, okay?  How can my blog make you and me happy together in this difficult world?  Maybe we can help get each other's priorities right about stuff.  With all of our happiness the goal, of course, not *only* yours and mine.  Can't afford to have anyone left out, you see, or next time you or I might be left out in turn.  I have this idea that maybe Nature somehow gets *trained* by us, to be like us, picking up our habit patterns as Her own.  That Nature is cruel because *we* have been cruel, and kind because we have been kind, from the beginningless past.  And that we need to try extra hard to be good, to make all of each other happy, so that eventually Nature as a whole will be like that for all of us, and we for Her.  If only we *work* hard enough at it, together, and play at it of course too... and maybe play is even more to the point, at least in terms of the spirit of the thing...  Couldn't that work?  I mean, in the *very* long run?  If not, what else?  'Cause something has to.  I for one can't stand all the suffering people are forced to go through, including myself what with this mysterious chronic pain problem and all.  So, I've made a vow.  I've vowed that someday everyone, and I mean *everyone* everywhere in the whole of Nature/the universe/the multiverse/everything, is going to be perfectly happy and free from suffering.  And I mean it terribly seriously, too.  I don't know how I'm going to manage it if even the Fully Enlightened Beings haven't managed to do it, *yet* being a keyword here, but I will.  I owe it to you people, and to myself.  See, I've had some happiness in this life, so I know what that's like.  And I like it.  And I sure know suffering too, and I despise the stuff.  I have most of this lifetime left to do my best for us all, and that means for you, my hoped-for friend, my dear reader.  And I plan to live to 100 easy, even if this pain problem doesn't go away, heavens forfend, and spend it all for us, so that gives me a few score years right there to work with.  Plus there's karma and reincarnation, both of which I'm personally convinced of, so that gives me quite a long time to work with really.  Actually, I believe we've been around through an infinite past and will be around for an infinite future, so that gives me loads of time in a way.  But the sooner we all make each other *really* happy, *perfectly* happy, the better, don'tcha think?  I honestly, honestly, most honestly believe that it's possible, in the long run.  Even inevitable, because that's what every living being wants, at least deep enough down, and some beings already seem to have achieved perfect happiness for themselves, and like microcosm like macrocosm, right?  Right.  Don't even *think* of arguing either, see, 'cause I've made up my mind, and when I *really* make up my mind things happen.  So.  I promise to make you perfectly happy forever if you don't manage it otherwise first.  Just have patience.  Totally healing the All is tricky business.  But it can and will be done.  That's a vow.

And that's the start of a blog.  Feedback to me if you like, if you're not cruel.  If there's one thing I can't stand it's cruelty.  Maybe we can be friends or something.

      hey, peeps.  i'm working on a *really* big project and my confidence is growing a lot.  it's all about making everyone truly happy, which is right along my lines.  someday in the not distant future i long to have a boyfriend to help me in my work and my play and my life in general.  i even envision myself marrying a boyfriend and sticking together for the *really* long haul.  i mean, i intend to live a long time, plus there's no such thing as death of the self anyway!  i'm very much an idealist, as you've probably gathered dear reader dear friend, and my boyfriend needs to be in harmony with my ideals and work.  you see, i'm building a group, a very special group of dedicated and sworn friends, upholding the highest ideals and helping each other in every relevant way to be truly happy and to support the true happiness of all who live.  i believe in noble, even holy, idealism.  and i believe in you, dear reader dear friend.  i don't believe in accidents or *mere* coincidences, and there's a reason for your reading my blog.  you are *meant* to.  and so i love you and welcome you and, well, l8rz...

      hey, peeps.  you know what, my dear reader my friend?  i love you.  that might sound corny and/or weird and/or unrealistic, but really properly analyzed it's not.  i love all living beings on general principles.  and i recommend that as a good way to be.  what does it mean that i love you, even not particularly knowing you well?  it means that i recognize you as a precious living being, deserving of happiness and its causes and deserving to overcome suffering completely.  it doesn't mean i know you personally and approve of your every characteristic.  i don't have to to love you as i do.  i wish you every happiness and no suffering at all.  a word of advice:  avoid malice like the plague.  i've decided that malice is the root cause of every suffering.  don't invest yourself in malice, even in subtle ways.  and don't fear malice.  by that i mean neither be afraid of (fear) malice nor obey (fear) malice.  and by malice i mean the wish and/or intention that someone suffer, in whatever way in whatever degree, be that yourself or someone else.  never punish yourself, cause that's a form of malice and you'll suffer for it.  and *noone* deserves to suffer.  dangerous people deserve to be quarantined so they don't harm people, but they don't deserve to be punished in the sense of being made to suffer.  imagine what the world would be like without any malice at all!  seriously, imagine it.  think about it.  invest your energy like that into making the world free from malice.  even those *thoughts* actually help, i promise!  thought power is a very real thing, and it has a greater effect upon oneself and others than most of us have been trained to imagine.  use it well.  use it joyfully to abandon malice in all of its forms.  i *promise* you you'll be making good karma that way and *will* be rewarded.  invest yourself well into the abandonment of malice and you'll be rewarded mightily.  this is no exaggeration.  the reward might take a while to reach you, but it *will* come.  this is a total promise.  we *can* eliminate malice, and we *will* eliminate malice.  this is a vow of mine as well as a promise.  so, dear reader dear friend, remember that i love you.  and write to me if you need a friend, 'cause i vow that i'll be as good a friend to you as circumstances make practical.  l8rz...

      hey, peeps.  just thought i'd tell you some things.

reality is totally composed of living beings, whom i prefer to call "natures."  nothing inanimate truly exists.  matter is not inanimate, but rather is both the separation and the connection of individual natures.  so long as their are individual natures, individual selves that is, and that's forever, there will be matter of some sort or other.

i worship the One Whom i call the Living Good.  i also call han Heaven, both as a place (or field of self/nature) and as a living Nature -- or rather, as a holy living Nature including its field of being and operation.  eventually all the universe/multiverse/the all will be Heaven and we'll all be amazingly happy with each other forever.  that's a vow and a promise.  trust me on this one, 'cause Heaven has given me a glimpse of that great and possible good.  above all, i want us all to be happy together forever.  everyone wants happiness.  everyone wants happy relationships.  i vow and promise that we'll all have that, as soon as that can be arranged.  don't be too skeptical about this, please, 'cause that will only delay entrance into Heaven.  and by Heaven i don't mean only an after-death state, but a state and a Nature which intersects even with this Earth, even now.

our right path in life is to do the will of Heaven as that is relevant to us individually.  that means working for the happiness of ourselves and everyone around us, and it means doing that work skillfully and successfully as much as that can be.  it means all of our learning *how* to make each other happy, and then of course doing it.

our right path is the path of ideal holiness, but please drop any strange ideas about what holiness is.  holiness is *not* being a fuddy-duddy stick-in-the-mud goodie-two-shoes, though it does mean being actually good.  true holiness is *fun*, happy and the *coolest* way to be.  truly holy people have a sense of *beauty*, of *fun*, of wit and *humor* and are the *coolest* people there could ever be.  for the truly holy people, life is a great and holy *Art* as much as anything else, and is profoundly fun.  if you're not having fun in your life, something in your life is *not* holy and needs to be purified away.

just remember, my dear readers/friends, that i love you very much and wish very deeply to be friends with you.  please feel free and totally invited to email me (click the "email david" link up near the top of the page), so long as you don't spam me.  i don't appreciate spam.  but i appreciate people very much, so please write me!

i'm waiting for a friend from my youth to email me.  he's turned out to be gay, which makes me happy.  i love him very much, and have since i first met him, and really hope to renew and deepen our friendship.  i miss him.  i miss him a lot.  i'm also waiting for his siblings to write me.  i'm fond of them too.  their aunt is passing on the news about me and giving them my email address.  i hope dearly that they use it.

      hey, peeps.  saw my lama yesterday.  he's wonderful.  he told me about psychic symptoms of mine which i had never told him at all!  he's highly insightful and perceptive and brilliant.  in other news, i've decided i will eventually (actually as soon as truly honestly practical) need a husband.  i deserve one, a wonderful one.  and i'll call him my husband, u.s. laws be damned!  actually, the lama i've been seeing picked up on this need of mine without my telling him about it, and said that if it made a difference i have his permission especially if it's someone i know really well first.  i love this lama.  i'm not romantically in love with him, but i love him very deeply spiritually.  he's a great help to me.  l8rz...

      bush is crazy.  he's stupid and crazy.  his whole administration is stupid and crazy.  people with real intelligence (excluding bush himself here) can be *so* stupid sometimes.  i'm politer than that when i write to him, for fear of john ashcroft who is one unholy terror, but the truth is the truth.  and yet i really believe that every living being has something wholesome and good at the core, difficult though it be to see in some cases.  in a way, i try to be forgiving.  but on the other hand, in another way, forgiveness isn't necessary since people aren't really to blame.  if they do evil it's because of ignorance and lack of control.  i think that even in the worst cases a person always does his or her best, which is to say the best he or she knows to do under the circumstances, which is sometimes pretty awful but still the best the person knows.  and "knows" is a keyword there.  a person might have an idea for a better course of action than he or she acts upon, but somehow that's not connected in with the person's sure and certain *knowledge*, where the bad action he or she actually ends up doing is.  in such case the bad action is somehow relatively comfortably within the person's known territory whereas the better alternative is fraught in the person's mind with uncertainty and fear.  l8rz...

      i don't know about you, but personally i'm in the habit of emailing "president" (unelected) bush and my senators and congressman.  it makes me feel better.  write to bush at  urlLink president@whitehouse.gov .  you can find the email addresses of your senators and congressperson at  urlLink http://www.peaceday.org/govt_em.htm .  it's easy, they must tabulate the responses, your senators and congressperson might possibly write back to you personally (bush never has to me) and if you have strong feelings about anything political it's practically your civic *duty* to write to them.  not to pressure you or anything... except, well, yeah!  i hereby pressure you to write to them.  l8rz...

      hey, peeps.

it's been a long time since i've posted to this blog.  i've come out publicly since then, in may of last year.  congratulate me!  this isn't my main blog anymore, though i haven't posted there either in a long time either, until just a few minutes ago that is, but there it is.

but i'll post here too.  this blog will be mostly about my life as a gay guy per se, my coming out process (i'm out publicly, but i don't think word has gotten everywhere yet for instance), my search for a boyfriend, for a life partner / husband and all that great stuff!

my chronic pain situation is gradually getting better, and i'm in better spirits about my situation and have more hope about my future.  congratulate me!

i'm searching, friend- and boyfriend-wise, basically on http://www.gay.com in the seattle and seattle north chat rooms, where my 'nym is ihy.  you can look for me there!  i've had some interesting chats on gay.com over the years.

more l8r.  cya, dear reader, dear friend.
