Like when I saw leens's blog on Wed , I saw her wrote that , she only had friends such as chun yan , Tuty , Zuo Han , Joseph and Wilfred ...  And there is not a mention of  my name ... Makes me wonder , wad am I during these 1 and 1/2 years , a passer-by , in her life or a not trustworthy person in her eyes ....  JUST WAD AM I IN HER EYES ?   Finally found a person that I can believe, I plucked up a lot of courage so as to believe in another ..... Am I being sensitive or she had maybe forgot to write my name???????    I really dunnoe but I only noe that I was very upset when I saw her blog .....  A lot of things happened during these period of time , things changes , I and Zuo Han now quarrel alot ...   Here i am really sorry , iam .. Every time when i quarrel w u , i felt terrible .. For example today , sorry that i tok to u rudely ....  I Just felt that u all are keepin sumtin behind me and i am afraid ... REALLY VER AFRAID .. i dunnoe  stressed up at home and at school and at friends ...  I'm really in a loss, i dunnoe wad i can do in order to wan huai this relationship w u all ... When leen  , chun yan and tuty are together , i felt like i am the odd one out  i dunnoe wad to do..........  IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII REALLYYYYYYYY DUNNOE Wad To Do !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Who Can help me ? I am in the dilemma   Can i tell them , or wad if i tell them they will feel awkward ...  Sum body pls pls help help me .

      Today is Cross -country , wake up early in the morning , wait for sis to go out w me , but instead dad is sending her to work , then hai me wait till 6.29am , then late . Upon reaching , I was very excited hopin that I can see him . Stupid of me to call Jun Hao to take a photo of him . The 3KM walk was fun, we talked joked, play along the road , bullying teddy.  When we reached the ending point , we saw a Malay child , he was crying , he lost his mother , we quickly accompany him to the station so that he can find his mother , then  carry him , he is so cute really very very cute.  Lucky , he found his mother , so happy .Hehehehehehe.    Yeah , the most exciting part is he is the FIRST to reach the finishing point . When we were in the fair , I met him , I looked at him secretly , when he turned , I think he saw me looking at him. Then Chun Yan , congratulate him, shaking his hand, then Wilfred was looking at me then i felt like i was blushing . Then i went to shake .....  Chun Yan's hand . STUPID , rite , haizzzz..........  Then i asked Jun Hao to take a photo of him then Jun Hao said If want , Then take a photo with him , If not then dun take ....  Eileen asked to find her then she said that she is asking him to take a photo with me , then i say dun wan , HOW STUPID of me , then Eileen said that we can take a group photo , then cut out me and him photo , but i still said 'NO' . Actually , i wanted it , but , i oso felt awkward at that point of time . Cos haizz i oso dunnoe why ...   Really hope that i could plucked out my courage and asked to take a photo of him myself ....   Any thing , Today's is TUTY's bdae , hope that she can spend today as a happy and fun day .... And also 7-eleven's bdae .... Heehee  Really upset , soon , i will be leaving , when will i have enough courage , maybe i will not have much time to see him , will he remember me , the idiot that admired him for 2 years and more... Really hope tat he will remember me and he will find his beloved one day ....   Hope that u will stay cute just as he will be like now ....  REALLY oso hope that i will start to strive for the Os   Wish Myself luck ....MUackzzzzzz  Miss u alot more than u can imagine .............
