      Write a 3-5 page report, discussing 1) where you would build a park in the United States, what kind of park it would be [theme? water or rollercoaster? for adults or children?], which rides, concessions, games, entertainment you would include, season length.  2) why your theme park would survive in that area and with that theme. Essentially you want to compare your proposed park to entertainment competition in your chosen area. Remember to discuss challenges and proposed solutions of that area. Keep in mind physical resources in the area you choose; cost of living; population density, growth, and demographics; weather patterns; transportation access.  You will present this information in a 8-10 minute powerpoint presentation on Wed, Aug 11. After your presentation you will turn in the hardcopy report to me.  Post questions about this assignment in the comments section.

      Which is more important-- personal privacy or controlling drug use of employees?   * The right to privacy The Constitution does not specifically mention a right to privacy. However, Supreme Court decisions over the years have established that the right to privacy is a basic human right, and as such is protected by virtue of the 9th Amendment. The right to privacy has come to the public's attention via several controversial Supreme Court rulings, including several dealing with contraception (the Griswold and Eisenstadt cases), interracial marriage (the Loving case), and abortion (the well-known Roe v. Wade case). In addition, it is said that a right to privacy is inherent in many of the amendments in the Bill of Rights, such as the 3rd, the 4th's search and seizure limits, and the 5th's self- incrimination limit. from  urlLink http://www.usconstitution.net/constnot.html#elec

      But what should people do if they don't have the perfect employer?   Take for instance, elementary school teachers. They have to take care of 25-30 seven year olds from 8am-4pm, five days a week. Most school teachers don't have any other adult in the room. If they have to use the bathroom, they must wait until their 30 minute lunch break or until the kids leave at 4pm. Most don't have a phone in their room. Some have computers, but schools have firewalled most sites to protect the children. So you usually can't access private email. Most teachers work from about 7 in the morning until 6pm at night, grading, scheduling, and organizing. The average teacher makes in the low to mid $30s, which works out to be $12-14/ hour, once you've taken out taxes, insurance, and certification fees.

      In todays society we are willing to go to pretty much any means to market our product.  The most popular way to market these days is to use sex because after all, sex sells.  How far is too far when it comes to marketing and what do you think is appropriate?  Do too many companies get away with inappropriate marketing?

      How much did you pay for that Starbucks non-fat double latte?  The big-time corporations like Sara Lee, and Nestle, make millions from coffee sales. Yet the coffee farmer who did all the back breaking work nets less than a dollar per pound. The farmers don’t make enough money to cover the bank loan let alone feed and educate their children. The poor farmers usually turn to growing coca bean to get out of debt.  The large corporations have continuously taken advantage of developing countries. Is it ethical for a corporation to pay less then a fair wage to developing countries?  Should we even be concern about a corporation’s activities overseas?

      So many times we take the national or local news to be the truth.  We don't see the news on the same level as other television programs or talk shows.  But what we tend to forget is that news programs are in the entertainment buisness.  Many conservatives accuse most national news media as being liberally biased.  At the same time, liberals complain about the majority of talk radio shows being mostly conservative.  Do you think that national and local news shows ever bend the truth or omit parts of a story in order to favor a particular political party or also to increase the entertainment value of the story?  Do you think this is right?  Should news outlets be required to stick strictly to the facts, or should they be allowed to present the stories the way they choose because they are just anonther television program trying to get ratings?

      Nepotism:  (n)  1. Favoritism shown or patronage granted to relatives, as in business. 2. Undue attachment to relations; favoritism shown to members of one's family; bestowal of patronage in consideration of relationship, rather than of merit or of legal claim.  Nepotism can be similiar to being born into a Monarchy. You don't actually possess the qualities to be a leader, a king, or president, but, you have the connections. Is it okay? What about if you started your own company and you son/daughter comes to you for a job(just barely passing college), and you have an application on your desk from a graduate that is highly qualified. Who do you choose? It is an ethical choice? What ever happened to making a living for yourself? Making your own name? Self-made Millionaires?  Large corporation CEO's, Hollywood actors, and even political figures all reserve the right to use nepotistical censureship with their family? What's in a name?  urlLink

        Corporations and think tanks hire lobbyists to influence legislation. These same companies contribute heavily to politicians' election campaigns. Lobbyist system supporters state politicians only act in the interest of campaign contributors because of shared ideologies and common interest. But the lobbyist system is also marred by corruption.       Do you believe it is ethnical for an elected official to support funding or legislation that benefits his campaign contributors? Would it be more ethnical to bar corporation contributions to election campaign?
