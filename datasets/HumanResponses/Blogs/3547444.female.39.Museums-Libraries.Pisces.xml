      This new novel about corporate espionage by Joseph Finder came as an advance reader's copy via one of the websites I visit on a regular basis. It's a page-turner, with short chapters and snappy dialogue. Lots of name-brand references and up to the minute computer technology references.  This book was a fun read that I have now passed along to my son who wanted some additional reading material while at Camp Buckner.

      One of the ironic things about Steve Almond's humorous and insightful book about small-time candy manufacturers in the United States is that the cover has quotes from rave reviews, of course. One of them is by Amy Sedaris and another describes Steve Almond as being the Dave Eggers of food writing. My mind immediately thought that Steve Almond is the David Sedaris of food writing because he gets such a big kick out of learning about how the different candy is produced and takes such pleasure in eating the candy that I wanted to try them all.   His writing reminds me of David Sedaris because he has such vivid memories of quickly eating his candy and wanting to sneak it from his brother. Clearly candy is the currency of childhood, as both Almond and Sedaris will tell you.  Unfortunately a lot of the candy he writes about is produced locally so isn't readily available. But now that I've heard the description of what an Abba Zabba bar is, next time I see one I will try one. (Because, frankly, there isn't a kind of candy that I won't eat, with the exception of black licorice!)

      For someone who grew up listening to new wave and punk rock music, I loved reading Aimee Cooper's musings on her life in the 1980s. Groups like The Jam, X and Black Flag may be pretty much forgotten now but back then for a certain group of people, they made a difference.  This paperback is only 132 pages and I read it in one afternoon but it's certainly worth reading if you want to get a feel for what was going on for punk rockers in California at that time. Hearing about the clothes, the clubs and the lifestyle was intriguing.  When Cooper describes how she and her friends dismissed Adam Ant's music (to the point of egging him at a public appearance!)brought back memories of high school friends who loved "Ant music" and its unique sound! This book was a great stroll down memory lane ... even if I never lived the punk rock lifestyle!

      Just got a brand new book called  The Jane Austen Book Club  by Karen Joy Fowler. This book caught my eye in the reviews because its focus is on a book discussion group which reads Jane Austen together.   Just this evening my book group was saying we should read another classic but my response was that  Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West  by Gregory Maguire is a modern day classic. We had a good discussion about the book and much to my surprise, everyone liked it!

      Just started reading  Inkheart  by Cornelia Funke. I'm actually reading this as part of an online book discussion group which should be interesting. It's an older kids/teen novel written by a German author. I read her first book  The Thief Lord  last year which was a great example of magical realism. It was a pretty straightforward novel until nearly the end when it had an interesting fantastical twist.  But, back to  Inkheart , I'm only on chapter two but from reading the reviews I know it's about a world where characters in books come to life which makes me think of  The Pagemaster , the intriguing movie made a few years back where a timid boy enters the library, gets trapped and must battle his way through various adventures with the help of characters from classic literature.

      Fresh from watching the Red Sox at Fenway over the weekend, I have another baseball book ready to read:  The Last Best League  :One Summer One Season One Dream  by Jim Collins. A former college baseball player, the author spent a season following the Chatham A's on Cape Cod before writing this book. The Cape Cod leagues, where college baseball players get a chance to show their stuff during the summer was also the setting for a fairly recent film favorite of mine called  Summer Catch  (Freddie Prinze Jr. & Jessica Biel.)  But, in the meantime I finished reading Gregory Maguire's  Wicked  and I loved it! Because this book was long and I only started it last week for this week's book club meeting, I felt like I was rushing through it. But the last 200 pages flew by and when I finished it tonight the payoff was so worthwhile. Maguire took a well-known, beloved story, gave it a bizarre spin and really made me think about good & evil.  Also, while I was reading this evening, an episode of "Stargate SG1" Season 6 had one of its "Wizard of Oz" references which was so great. Col. O'Neill always seems perplexed when the beings his team encounters on other worlds don't get his "ding, dong the witch is dead" comments!  "I'll get you, my pretty and your little dog, too!"   I'm looking forward to the discussion this week, it should be fun!

      Mostly I've been reading  Wicked  but yesterday I started another David Sedaris book,  Holidays on Ice.  The centerpiece of this book is his essay entitled  Santaland Diaries  in which he writes about being an elf in Santaland at Macy's. I was reminded of his description of how they all have made-up elf names when we ate dinner out tonight. For a change we didn't go to a restaurant where the waiter was overly happy & had a fake name. Just good food, nothing fancy. But I digress.   This slim volume, 123 pages, is a fun, fast read. His descriptions of the annoying folks who traipse through Santa's village are priceless. Don't read it, if you don't want to laugh!

      Working in a library I see a lot of books. There are so many good titles out there it's hard to choose. After seeing this book on the shelf for months, I heard about the musical "Wicked" coming to Broadway. Well now it's been there since October 2003 (right about the time I started as the teen librarian) and it's a hit! Thanks to my co-worker Nance & her daughter Val, I've heard the music and love it! (Another not so very deep, dark secret is my love of Broadway musicals!)  So, when it came time to suggest a book for my group, I proposed this one and to my surprise, it was chosen. (It's a highly competitive lobbying and selection process which I will explain further in the future!) Just started reading it last night (the reason I didn't post) and it's a lot of fun.  Since most everyone knows the movie "The Wizard of Oz," the characters are established except we are meeting the Wicked Witch of the West in her infancy as she grows up in her green-skinned glory! The author Gregory Maguire is one of a handful of writers who take classics and retell the story from a different point of view. His other books include  Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister  and  Mirror, Mirror.

      I've been reading Jasper Fforde's third book about Thursday Next recently. After reading "The Eyre Affair" and "Lost in a Good Book," I was eager to keep going into this alternate history, a world where books & literature are really taken seriously. (I especially love the descriptions of riots between factions who differ as to who really wrote the works of Shakespeare! Could it really be Marlowe?)  In this book our heroine Thursday Next has entered the world of Jurisfiction and is languishing in an unpublished novel while she figures out how to get her husband back. The fun thing about these books is all the references to literature. Reading the Mrs. Tiggy-winkle from the Beatrix Potter books works as an agent of Jurisfiction and does the washing!  On the other hand, this book isn't flowing as well as the other two but I'm enjoying it and would definitely recommend the other two to anyone who enjoys fantasy/sci-fi and literature.  Another cool thing about these books is the fantastic website:  urlLink

      After finishing "Me Talk Pretty One Day," I'm back to reading "Watching Baseball: Discovering the Game Within the Game" by Jerry Remy with Corey Sandler.   Actually I'm reading this when I feel like learning a bit more about baseball. Remy, as many people know, does the color commentary for the Boston Red Sox on NESN. I've only recently started watching baseball (and in Rhode Island, there's only one team, the Red Sox!)... but, like so many things in my life, it all started with a book.   My co-worker Tim always wears a Red Sox cap, the Red Sox AAA affiliate is in the small city where we work so I would ask him a question or two, and next thing you know he suggests I read "Moneyball: The Art of Winning and Unfair Game" by Michael Lewis. Published in 2003, Lewis ponders the success of various teams based on the money spent on players and the quirky stats amassed on these guys. This very well-written book was interesting to me but at the same time I felt like I needed a baseball dictionary at my elbow to translate it as I was reading. But asking fans and checking websites has helped me figure out what's what! (Keep in mind that I grew up without watching any sports but, on the other hand, the only major league baseball game I've ever gone to was at Fenway Park back in 1980!)  So once baseball season got underway I began watching games and hearing more about the game. It intrigues me ... yet at times I read during games. Guess I'm not a true fan, yet!

      After reading reviews of David Sedaris's new book "Dress Your Family in Corduroy & Denim," I went back to the stacks to find "Me Talk Pretty One Day." So far I'm more than halfway through and I'm really laughing out loud when I read it. Sedaris has a wicked sense of humor!   Don't know why I didn't read this when it first came out. Maybe because after so many people built up Dave Eggers's "A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,"(a book I didn't particularly like) which I think came out around the same time... I thought his book would be similar. Clearly my mistake because I was getting a big kick out of Dave and his siblings being forced to take music lessons and taking a back seat to the family dog!  Of course just today I bought "The Bookclub Cookbook" (say that three times fast! Or just once, it's confusing enough, huh?) What a fun, fun book! So far between my book discussion group and my own personal reading, most of the books mentioned I know of or have read. I'll post more once I've really gone through the book.

       Gasping for Airtime: Two Years in the Trenches of  Saturday Night Live   by Jay Mohr is the latest book I'm reading suggested by a friend. The funny thing is that I know Jay Mohr from the movies he's been in like "Paulie" (a kids movie about a parrot) or the silly but cute "Picture Perfect" with Jennifer Anniston. The person who recommended the book to me knew Mohr was on SNL and on "The Jeff Foxworthy Show." That's the difference between being a mother who enjoys sappy romantic comedies and being a guy in your 20s and actually staying up to  watch SNL, I guess!  His book is very readable and fascinating because Mohr describes how when he started work on SNL, he began having panic attacks. The cool thing is that the whole book isn't focused on this but it's definitely a part of his story. On the other hand, when he describes interacting with the late Kurt Cobain after rehearsing with Nirvana, you feel as if you are there. Or hearing about how he wrestled with the late Chris Farley, it's definitely laugh out loud funny!

      To tell you the truth, I was reluctant to read  Truth & Beauty [a friendship]  by Ann Patchett, because I thought it would be sad. This story about the relationship between writers Ann Patchett and the late Lucy Grealy sounded touching. Yet knowing that Grealy ultimately takes her own life made me think long and hard about whether I wanted to read thisbook. But when Nancy, one of my co-workers, told me she read it and loved it, I thought I would take a chance.   My book group read Ann Patchett's wonderful  Bel Canto  but the only thing I knew about her friend Lucy is that she was the author of  Autobiography of a Face  which detailed how she went through cancer surgery and reconstruction of her face.  So far I'm only a few chapters into the book but I'm enjoying what I've read so far.   UPDATE:   Teen Angst? Naaah!  proved to be a funny, insightful book ... Ned Vizzini made me remember what it was like being in high school!

       Teen Angst? Naaaah ...  by Ned Vizzini is a book I purchased this spring at New England Mobile Bookfair (Newton Highlands, MA ... great bookstore!) for my teen fiction collection at the library. Just saw something on one of the listservs about Vizzini participating in an online discussion about teens & libraries so I decided to check out his book.  A 1999 graduate of Stuyvesant High School in New York City, Vizzini writes about things I can relate to as the mother of sons. He recalls the chaos that ensued in his Brooklyn apartment when Nintendo made its presence known, for example. (In my half-hearted attempt to keep videogames out of the house, I refused to purchase one. My oldest son finally got a secondhand Nintendo from a friend of mine after she broke up with the boyfriend who had given it to her!)  So far I am enjoying this book a lot ... it's in paperback and generally an easy read.   UPDATE: Three Junes  by Julia Glass ... the July selection for my book group ended up being really good. The middle section almost made me give up for a while but I persevered and the payoff was a really good story about very interesting characters so I am looking forward to tonight's discussion!

       Three Junes  by Julia Glass is the July selection for my book discussion group. It's interesting to me because the first section is written in the voice of the father and the second is his son, after the father has died. The family lives in Scotland but the son later moves to New York City. &nbsp; The book is about 350 pages long and I'm halfway through at this point ... I'll update this when I'm done!

      Finally got my hands on  Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim  by David Sedaris and I couldn't stop reading it. Reading about David Sedaris describing a sleepover or his brother's wedding on the beach in North Carolina, just made me laugh out loud! Even my 12-year-old son said to me, "You must really like that book!"   Of course not every essay hits a home-run but his musings on Anne Frank's hiding place and the etiquette of cell phone calls just made me chuckle to myself and then read the passages to my husband as we drove back to Rhode Island from New York.  If you haven't read David Sedaris yet, pick up one of his many books and decide for yourself.

       Airborn  by Kenneth Oppel is a book aimed at teens that I just finished reading because I received an advance reader's copy a while back. The fantastical elements of the novel are balanced by a reality where airships rule the sky and they fly over the Atlanticus. When Cabin Boy Matt Cruse befriends a girl his age on the airship, he ends up discovering a species of flying mammal. Meanwhile the airship is skyjacked by pirates, they are shipwrecked and nearly killed!   The book was really fun to read and a page-turner, even though it was 353 pages long. Even adults can enjoy this book if they like fantasy and adventure.
