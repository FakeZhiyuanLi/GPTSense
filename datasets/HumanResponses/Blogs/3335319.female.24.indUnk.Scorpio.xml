      Please read Kevin's 'Surprising' blog about the Planned Parenthood's new t-shirt. Now&nbsp;I don't write this blog because I am ProLife to the core of my being. I write it for all the women who have had to make this decision and are not proud of it. I have close friends who have had to make the decision to exterminate a human life and they would admit this was not their shining moment. To me this spits in the face of the women who have been thru this and lives that have been lost as well. If you feel strongly about this I encourage you to email the Planned Parenthood store and ask them to take this tacky attempt at politics off their shelves. The email is:&nbsp;  urlLink store@ppfa.org  Thanks for listenin'! What is your soap box issue today?

      So you would think that my mom and dad would be going thru some 'empty nest' syndrome right now with me getting married and all. Nope! My mom's brother and sister (that we haven't seen or heard from in nine years) are now living at the lake with my parents!! Yup, very interesting story...do tell... ok so in May my mom gets a call from a woman in Washington state claiming to be my uncle David's girlfriend/wife/person and tells mom that uncle David has driven from the west coast all the way to the big Lake Arrowhead to stay awhile.&nbsp; Mom's like, yeah right ok. The very next day he calls from Jolly Truck Stop and asks how to get out to their house. Mom's freaking out. Oh just to let you know my aunt and uncle were druggies in Vegas&nbsp;and when Grandpa died they came in and stole from us, so no good people.&nbsp; So uncle David is sick, he needs to be close to a VA hospital (OKC) to get treatment for his heart. He is clean, has his own travel trailer he lives in, helps around the house alot, and got a job!! This is leaps and bounds for this man!! His relationship with my mom&nbsp;has mended and it is wonderful to see MY relatives in this area (since all of your relatives have kinda become my relatives). So on to the aunt. She met a man and they hitchhiked, yes hitchhiked, from Oregon to Tennessee in three months. She got a job there and a house and started to coorespond with mom for about a year. &nbsp;Now mom and aunt Wanda don't get along because of past choice aunt Wanda has made. But they have kinda made amends over the past year. Mom gets a call Monday that the man aunt Wanda's with is on major drugs, drinks all the time, beats her and has threatened to kill her. Which scared mom and me too. If this dude killed my aunt we wouldn't even know it. If she stopped cooresponding with mom, we would think that she is up to her old ways and wouldn't think twice. So I told mom to go get her. So they are now on thier way back from Tennessee, safe and sound. Aunt Wanda gets my old room, I cleaned it and decorated it all yesterday. I hope she feels safe now. It's great to have your family within arms reach. I feel everyone has&nbsp;come home and I now realize why God had me move back here. Wonderful to see yourself in other people, I never really had that growing up. I hope you guys will get to meet&nbsp;MY family for a change, we are very different but I think that's refreshing! Any baby-momma-drama you want to get off your chest?

      It is so f**king cold in my office!! Slabs of beef would have frost bite!! Our air conditioner is stuck on...well...on and will never shut off!!! Plus it is raining cats and dogs outside and so I am sopping wet on top of freezing my ass off! Uggg!! So anyway, as I look out on my veiw of the metroplex that is Wichita Falls and see the rain and fog and feel the haunt of winter closing in (yeah I know just turn on the heater) I feel like I should be making Christmas lists and getting ready for Wales. But then I remember it's only July and I think wow, how weird this summer has been, and not just weatherwise! It was only a few years ago when we could not have been seperated and now look, we are so far away. Husbands away from wives, best friends going thru the trails of life in other parts of the world, alone, our souls are in Kansas, Houston, Utah, Wales, Ft Worth, Tulsa, while our bodies are at home. I think we are one soul revealing to other souls the true meaning of friendship. And I sit here shaking partly from the cold and partly because of the reality that maybe we will never have OBU and Henrietta again. But that maybe that was us preparing to effect others and that the only time we will be constantly together like in those lost days is in our combined souls!!?? We will always have our history!! What is your fondest memory of 'us'!!??

      So my new favorite song is Beth Hart's 'Delicious Surprise'.&nbsp; It was on a CD that Pea made for me and&nbsp;I can't stop blaring it!!&nbsp; It reminds me of all of us and the amazing drive we all have! We never give up, none of us! So here it is!!:    If I won the lottery    I'd dance naked in the streets with a top hat full of money    and you'd want to get to know me    If I won the&nbsp;lottery   (the is Kenneth to a tee!)     And If I was a movie star    I'd tape money to a pickle jar    in the back of my limousine    And you'd call me an icon    And I'd be looking back at you from the cover of a People magazine   (This reminds me of our own stars Michelle and Dustin)     &nbsp;   And I guess it's all for the takin'    And I think it's all your and mine    My sister says I got to see it and believe it and I believe it    Won't sleep til I have enough    Won't drink my wine from no paper cup    Won't sleep til I have enough     &nbsp;   I'm just an outsider    Living in a trailer with my black and white TV set   (Ho, can you see it, we were living this huh!)    If only I was president   (Lorna, you have a dream, remember!!;)    I'd paint the White House pink    and never have to pay the rent   (wouldn't you love that Michelle!!)     &nbsp;   My preacher says I got to see it and believe it and I believe it     &nbsp;   Delicious suprise, and I do believe in my life and I knew it all the time     &nbsp;   I got something to believe in    But all I really want now is a handful of salvation   (I see this in you Pea, you have arrived there)     &nbsp;   We won't sleep to we get enough    We won't have our wine with no paper cup    And we believe!!!    Writing doesn't do it justice! Go get the song!! It'll get you going!!  Oh, What do your pj's look like!!??      &nbsp;  &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;

      So I just heard my name sake has his own shoe!! For those of you who are out of the sport loop, Kevin Garnett of the Timberwolves. So I totally have to get a pair!! J/K! Ok so sorry I've been unblogging lately! I've been really busy at work and trying to cram 315 pgs of Forster's Howards End by Mon. Crazy! So KW and I have started a real live budget!! Which is new to me b/c of the fact that I have never had enough money to even shit much less budget it.&nbsp;So it looks like KW and I will be debt free in 2 and a half years and that includes the credit card&nbsp;I haven't paid on in almost three years. We are planned to have 4 count 'em 4 credit cards paid off by April! If you have any financial difficulties please&nbsp;check out Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University!! Wonderful program!! I'm movin' on up&nbsp;kids!! No more trailer livin', no electricity&nbsp;or water being shut off&nbsp;for months at a time, no more Ramon eatin' ever again!! Never!! We can even tithe now, which for those of you who know my past&nbsp;this is amazing! Which is where I need your help!! We are off and on going to First Baptist here in the big WF, but I don't feel comfortable giving there when&nbsp;they just dropped over 22 milion on their new sancutary.&nbsp; I would rather give to those in need, and Kenneth feels the same. We don't have alot right now, but if you know anyone who needs some help, we feel called to give!! Please let us know!! Thanks for listenin'!&nbsp;Oh, what did you guys&nbsp;see outside (in nature) that amazed you today? See ya Kia!!&nbsp;

      Ok, ladies and gents it's offical! I am now, according to the DMV and our lovely bank, not yet SS, Garnet LaVaun Gilbreath!! Who would have know that my name could ever be a partial alliteration! Wonderful things! It makes me sad to think that my dad will lose that Swift 'legacy', b/c I'm an only child and all, but I guess I'll always be a Swift at heart. Well, and I will technically be a hyphenated married girl til I get my bachelors, Swift-Gilbreath is a little long though! But what's in a name, really! Do any of you married darlings have fond memories of changing your name?

      Me and the husband are in Tyler this weekend visiting one of our favorite lakeside homeowners. Tyler is the home of almost hostile segregation, crazy car commercials, and antique shops that all close at five on the dot! But we always have a blast here visiting! I didn't get any of my reading done for my 20th century Brit Lit class, but hell, the trip to Fat Dogs and watching China videos was worth it!!

      Ok since I am a lit girl, this title suites my mood today! If you haven't been made to read Heart of Darkness, you should have! But anyway, I feel we are all like Marlow and a little bit of Kurtz too. What stops us from going over the edge like Kurtz? Is it the same thing that pulls Marlow from the edge? And why is everything in our lives flickers of moments and not ever about the big picture? Are we so defined and even judged by our flickers, no matter how Marlow or Kurtz they may seem? Another words, why do I do something and you don't when we are both so alike? And why are we judged by our 'somethings'? Wow, Modernism is so depressing sometimes!! Ok so on a happier note, We got our wedding pics in!! I'll have to show ya'll!

Well, here is some insight that I think everyone should look into! Please go see the new Michael Moore documentary!!

      I am on the clock making blogs!! Isn't the world great when your boss has been at his lake house for four days and you are stuck at work alone with no drive to actually earn your living!? What do you think about 'playing' on the clock? I say as long as you get your work done and don't get caught, go for it!! So I guess I should start on my work since I have 30 min til I leave for the day!! Yeah!! Having fun today??

      As a guard instructor, I try really hard not to pick favorites, but I think I have found a guard genius. This kid, Jay, is amazing, I mean the rest of my guard is full of very fast learners and dedicated, but this kid!!??  So since I try to limit my bragging during practice, I'll brag here! Jay is in ninth grade and a typical ninth grade boy. He plays football, basketball, and trombone. At the beginning of last year (his 8th grade year) he was very unhappy and almost a pest at times, very difficult for Kenneth to handle. He hung around the band hall all the time, almost like he didn't want to ever go home. So in May I was writting the try out routine for this fall's guard and he asked if I would teach him a few things. So I did and picked up rather quickly. He asked if he could come to practice and try outs just to get the experience ( he wants to march and play but wants to be in Winterguard) . I said sure, and at tryouts I asked Jay if he would like to perform and he did. He was AMAZING!! In one week this kid had the whole routine down and was very articulate and body aware. He was better than my girls from last year!! So now that summer band has started, I have been training my girls on weapons and the have caught on. Jay was sitting in our rehearsal today, just watching. I told him to grab a sabre and join us, he did reluctantly. Jay has NEVER touched a weapon before in his life. I very quickly told him how to hold it and the just of the spin technique. I was in a hurry because we didn't have much time, I thought he would just get the feel of the sabre, but not be able to do much with it since I hadn't trained him. He did two messy spins, I corrected him and he then did the next four perfectly! Yes, Perfectly!! I just started laughing, I couldn't believe it! I went on to singles (both blade and hilt), two messy ones each and then perfect (minus the freehand)! This kid picked up a sabre 5 min ago!! And the craziest thing is his face. All the stress of home, of trying to be a bad ass and fit in at school, all the unhappiness vanished. This kid is in his element and is completely content. Amazing!! I LOVE my job!! What's the most amazing thing you've seen today?
