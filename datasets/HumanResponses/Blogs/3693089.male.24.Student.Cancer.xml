                 BUSSINESS EXERCISE    On 24th of June, 2004 our whole class went for a Busssiness Excercise. It was a new experience  for us. It was a very tiring day but in the end we all enjoyed it, this was the first time that  most of us went into the market, and ofcourse I was one of them. We left the college at about 10:40 am, after the briefing by Mr. Manohar Kamath, who was the incharge of this Business Exercise. The exercise was that we all were to go to Kopergaon Park, without spending any money, look for a job there, earn money Rs.25/head and get back without spending any money. We were divided into group of 2 each. In all our class was made into about 25 groups.Three of us were having a mobile with camera, they were assigned the duty of capturing these precious moments of our lives. Rest all we were to manage by ourselves. We were supposed to report back before 5:00 pm. Finally, the day in market began. I was able to arrange a conveyance for me right outside the college. That dropped me to E sq. complex, but this was the only place I knew, from there i asked someone at the redlight to give me lift towards the Kopergaon, he left me at some place, the name I don't know.From there i arranged another lift and again and again and again and finally I reached Kopergaon park. Now the next aim was to find some good hotels and a job in them, i started on. The first restaurent, i tried in, was Herbs and Spice.But my luck, the manager was not there he was to arrive at 1:00pm. I took a quick decision and turned for another restaurent which again was not a success. I took a lift and went further down the road, I saw another restaurent and went in. I met the director there, Mr. Satayajit, I told him about the Exercise. He gave me the manager's no. and asked to contact him. I called Mr. Sajid , who I think was very busy in his work, so he asked me to talk after 7:30 pm, which was ofcourse of no use. Then, I went to another restaurent, Riverside View, the manager was not there again. But I tried to negotiate with the person in charge, meanwhile my other team member was also in Kopergaon Park, serachig. I got a call from him that he has arranged it.So,I quickly left the place to join him. The restaurent was SHATRANJ, it was a multicuisine restaurent, the manager's name was Mr. Vijay Naidu. We represented ourselves as Resarch Executives, because at other places we were asked to show our Id cards. The work started with doing a survey with the guests at Shatranj. We made a questionaire and the consumer's about their choices and the things they would like us to improve, we represetned Shatranj. We also tried to get into the kitchen , which was a forbidden area. We spent some time in the kitchen and we knew that from where did the delicious come, but we were not allowed to do any work there.But we managed to arrange the following data: No. of workers-10,no. of chefs-05. All below metric level in education. The accountant and cashier were graduates. Salary of none was disclosed to us, they belonged to places like Maharashtra, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh. The rest. was setup in 1984, and it was performing well for the past few years, it earned hugely during the wedding season. The rest. was also gave conference facility. The day before they earned Rs.28,000. The customers included family (mostly)and walkins too. the rest. gets packed by 7:00pm and goes like this upto 12:00pm.computer was used for billing purposes, the software being JRSS. The average bill per consumer ranged between Rs.500 to Rs. 1000.The rest. earned about Rs.8000 during weekdays and Rs.15000 during weekends. We anyhow complied the data. the manager then called us for lunch, as we didn't worked so we didnt asked for money and left the place after thanking him. But before leaving we showed him what all we found out, the pleasant ambience, good quality delecious food, good service and also the complaints and the improvements that were suggested by the customers. We came back the same way, taking lift. The day was tiring but it gave a very new experience and it was enjoyable and exciting.
