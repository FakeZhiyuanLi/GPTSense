      &nbsp;  July 23, 2004 2:45 am  I just got off the phone with Angelica and she is hurt, she tells me, because I lied to her about not wanting a break.&nbsp; She thinks that I lied about everything I told her in the car the other night, that’s what I feel anyways.&nbsp; I know and I don’t know why things are going to be different I mean, she always told me that things would never change drastically if I ever decided to take a break.&nbsp; Yet, this shit is all fucked up.&nbsp; I really questioned the strength of her feelings for me when she told me that she didn’t think she could wait for me, I mean I waited for her while she talked to one guy on the phone in front of my face and while another put his arm around her everyday like he had been the one telling her that&nbsp; he would do anything in the world for her and really mean it.&nbsp; I was patient because the fact that I love her and she loves me kept me from losing my mind.&nbsp; It was hard but I did it.&nbsp; I guess we have to see where this goes from here.&nbsp; She claims that she’s too ahead of me but I want to tell her is that she is too ahead of herself.&nbsp; I knew that if i didn't do this that it would cause problems for us later in our lives.&nbsp; but now she is talking as if there is no more future for us.&nbsp; i really do love her, she keeps on saying that she needs to approve of my&nbsp; "new girlfreind" but no matter how many times i tell her that i am doing this to see how my life is when i make decisions based on what i want to do and not what is convenient for others.&nbsp; i want to be my own boss still, im only 17 years old, i don't want to feel tied down at this age, its too soon.&nbsp; she said she's too commited and in her mind she is 25 years old and she always knew she needed someone older.&nbsp; i don't know what is going to happen from here but, i will definitely keep writing on this thing.&nbsp;
