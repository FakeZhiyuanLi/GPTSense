      I've tried this a couple times before but never really got into it. Maybe with all my current free time Ill be able to maintain this bad boy. Its memorial day today, wahoo! I really can't say I know a whole lot about this holiday so I asked my butler Jeeves to tell me a little about it.  Appearently it was originally called Decoration day and it was meant to commemorate the people who have died in our nation's Militaries. Sounds good to me.   I don't think I have any relatives that have passed away who were in the service. Oddly enough everyone that I know of who has served is still alive. What about you, what do you do on this day? Is it just a day off from work or school, or do you actually do some type of annual celebration/family get together type thing?

      Yay! I got my job back being a garbage man. So hopefully I can keep both my pizza job and my garbage job. For some reason being employed makes me feel like less of a loser. I feel pretty damn good right now. I now know Ill be able to do some of the things Ive been planning and to make sure I get completely out of debt. Wow I feel good. What a nice day.

      Very little happened today. Contined the job search as I recovered from this mornings hangover. It was pretty friggin rough. Both the search and the hangover. I decided that I will have no problem getting a job after I graduate. Which is a good thing. However, untill then I wont be able to have any sort of reliability because of my constant moving. This isn't a bad thing. I will force myself to be content in working shitty jobs, because then when my time comes I wont have to worry about it anymore. I would much rather get all the bad stuff out of the way right now. In fact I will continue to make sure that more and more bad stuff happens now so I will have dealt with it and be ready for my real life as a grown up. The more shit I deal with now the less shit I will have to learn in the future. Sounds like a good plan right?  Btw I suck at Golden Tee. And there were these two jackasses at the bar that I thought we were going to have to take out back and give a womping too. I had little to say, at first I thought they were just fucking around and having some fun which was totally cool, but then they started getting all worked up about nothing. I must have missed something. Anyways, we left at close without incident. And the waitress was really fuckiing hot as usual.

      In high school I worked at this pizza restauraunt as a cook and a driver. I t was pretty fun but I left there almost 5 years ago. Yesterday I returned. Different name and different ownership but the place is the same. Im hoping this will only be supplementary income in addition to another, ass kicking job. But only time will tell if thats true or not. Looking for jobs this summer has been kind of a spiritual depanting. Im even applying at hotels, which is breaking my blood oath to never again work at a hotel. I wish I could just go be a garbage man like I did last summer. That job really kicked some serious ass. I knew what was expected and I knew what I could and couldnt do. The only thing I had to do was do my job and everyone was happy and then I could just screw off the rest of the time. Bah ! Give me a job dammit.

      I woke up a lot later then I had wanted today. I usually beat myself up over stuff like this and get real cranky. Today however I am thinking, whats the point. I don't have a job right now, I didn't miss class. The only reason I had to wake up early today was to get online and watch tv. I need to find a summer job. I will go to a new level of insane if I can't find something to do with my time.  I went and saw Endless Sunshine on a Spotless Mind last night. That's Jim Carrey's latest non-comedic performance. And I would say its damn good. A lot of what is happening is really sublte untill the end when it becomes more and more drastic and noticible. The movie raised soem questions that made me sad though. Or more just deep in thoughts about what would I do if given the same chances. Definetly needed strong drink after that one.  Then I bumped into some old friends at the bar. It was really cool to see people who I have known forever but haven't seen in years. Nice to know that good people are still out there. I deal with so many douchebags on a day to day basic that I start to forget about the truly cool. That really cheered me up.  Oh yeah, and I Twolves lost. Boo. I really havent been into pro sports since I was a kid but Ive been really into the twins and the Wolves this last year. THen when the wolves made it so far in the playoffs I was super excited. It was fun to care about them again. They played their hardest and got further then they had before, so good for them.
