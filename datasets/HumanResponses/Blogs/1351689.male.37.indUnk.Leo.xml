      Ever wonder what its like to be a free expression advocate? Well, I posted the article yesterday on the Dixie Chicks (should be directly below this post)--below is the first response I received.    For her being an American to go over to another country and dis-own the President is as bad as if she would have spit on the American Flag. I mean who was she trying to make friends with and suck up to, she only did it for applause, let her stay over there and shoot cracks at America. It's one thing to voice your opinion while standing on American soil to Americans, it's yet another to leave this country and throw dirt and talk shit about America, I'm all for boycotting anything that has anything to do with the Dixie Chicks or the French ( I might just stop eating French Fries). How soon they both forgot that they are only able to voice those opinions because of American Troops putting their life on the line all day and all through the night as you sleep can can have no fear because there is an American Soldier losing sleep so you can be safe. The French would be talking German and the Dixie Chicks would have no Dixie left for their namesake if it wasn't for the Americans before them that fought and sometimes died for them. As for you, you sound like someone that doesn't put enough value on the Freedom that you have and if asked you would turn tail and run before you'd think there was anything with value enough for you to fight for. So if you don't like this country and the few values we hold dear,leave. While we make sure our way of life and our Freedom will never die. The freedom's you enjoy are because better men then yourself have allowed you to do such. I'm proud to be an American and have fought to keep her Free have you?  PS: if you litened to the message of America instead of running Spell-checker you might do better.    Lovely, eh? I do love America...I'm just not so hot on my fellow Americans.

         Following is an article I've written for the 'zine  urlLink m-80 , to be published next month:   Thank God for talk radio. Without those postulating blowhards, we might never have discovered the great threat to democracy that lurked among us�the latest addition to the axis of evil: the Dixie Chicks.  During a March 10th concert in London, lead Chick Natalie Maines slagged the Commander in Chief by saying, �Just so you know, we�re ashamed the President of the United States is from Texas.�  Within a week, dozens of radio stations (and several radio networks) pulled all Dixie Chicks songs from their playlists. In South Carolina, the state legislature approved a resolution calling for the Dixie Chicks to play a benefit concert for military families. In Kansas City, Missouri, local patriots staged a �Chicken Toss��inviting their America-loving friends and neighbors to toss Dixie Chicks CDs and tapes into the trash. In Louisiana, concerned citizens held a demonstration that involved a mass destruction of the group�s CDs.  For as large a controversy as Natalie�s comments made back home, they didn�t seem like any big deal at first. Six London papers reviewed the show and not one made any reference to the comment. Further, the American ambassador to Britain�who was in attendance at the concert�came backstage afterwards to greet the group and made no reference to the remark. In fact, no one seemed concerned about the statement at all until it ended up in a posting on the ultra-conservative website  urlLink freerepublic.com  (the Ebola virus can�t spread as quickly as rumors posted to this site�the central breeding ground for much of the discussion topics found on conservative talk radio). Then, all hell broke loose.  Once the controversy erupted, Maines dropped to her knees and puckered faster than a ten-dollar hooker working for a twenty-dollar tip. Within hours Maines offered an apology, claiming the remark was �disrespectful.� However, the apology didn�t seem to register with the lynch mobs.  Even though news of the comment coincided with the emotional outbreak of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the reactions were quick and visceral. Concerned citizens wanted blood at the mere mention of �unpatriotic� behavior, without much concern for insignificant items like truth or details, or the potential implication of their actions. One radio station in Dallas logged 700 calls on the day the story broke, calling the group �anti-Bush,� �anti-American,� and �anti-troop.� It�s particularly disconcerting how quick these people were to toss around terms meant to dismiss any dissenter as an underhanded traitor. As if we didn�t learn a lesson when conservatives co-opted �family values� in the mid-nineties, apparently warmongers have now commandeered the concept of patriotism.  It seems whenever someone questions the war in Iraq, others ask, �Well, you support the troops, don�t you?� To be honest, no, I don�t support the troops. While I am thankful for anyone who is willing to put themselves in harm�s way to protect me, and I don�t want anyone to come home in those seventy-thousand body bags recently ordered by the Pentagon, I am not willing to throw support behind a M-16-toting trained soldier simply because I might hurt their feelings. Saying you  don�t  support a war, but  do  support the troops is nonsense. It�s similar to saying that the made-for-TV version of The Music Man sucked, but you support the actors. Empty and pitifully meaningless.  Regarding the particulars of Natalie�s statement�I not only agree with her�I�ll take it a step further: W. is an embarrassment to just about any geographic or demographic category. There was no better illustration of this than a recent joint press conference with British Prime Minister Tony Blair. While Blair is equally full of bangers and mash, at least you get the idea that he can spell �weapons of mass destruction� and pronounce the name of the country he�s invading (it�s �I-rock,� George, not �I-rack�). Instead of adequately defending his fictitious justifications for his pre-emptive military attacks, it took all Geo�s efforts simply to keep his tenses straight.  The true impact of the boycott/ban is hard to gauge. Remember, the Chicks recently sold more than 867,000 concert tickets in a single day�it would take a lot more than one cheap shot at Bush to keep food off their table. The ironically titled �Travelin� Soldier� did fall from #3 on the Billboard country charts to #7 the week following the brouha, but it�s hard to associate that with the negative press. Dropping to #70�maybe, but it still remained in the top 10.  As of this writing, the incident is already quieting down. While the Dixie Chicks are slowly working their way back onto radio playlists�Cumulus Broadcasting is still vowing that these pinko Commie hussies will never sing a note on the company�s forty-two stations�ever. Judging by similar radio bans over the past fifty years�that conviction will last until it impacts ad revenues. Those who have vowed to disrupt the Dixie Chicks� upcoming U.S. tour had their buzz killed when they realized the tour was virtually sold out. Not quick to give up the ship, several easily excitable talk radio gashounds have vowed to stage alternative �pro-American� concerts on the same evening as the Chicks� local appearances.  There are those who think you should do your patriotic duty by destroying your Dixie Chicks CDs, protesting their concerts, and not listening to stations that continue to play them. However, if you believe in America, you should do all of those things, if for no other reason than you have the right to do so. When we were granted the �right� to free speech, there was no qualification that required those thoughts and ideas to be popular or even make sense. And last time I checked, nowhere in the Bill of Rights is �supporting troops� mentioned. Even though we are attempting to liberate a country from a repressive regime that eliminates the presence of dissent and has no regard for civil liberties, we seem to be doing our damn best to emulate their actions.  In other words, if you do not purchase Dixie Chicks albums, the terrorists have won. Not the Al-Qaeda terrorists, but the one running our own country.

      I am notorious for starting many things and finishing few. Further, I tend to cycle obsessions. I was the kid who discovered a hobby one day, was a complete freak about it a week later, became an expert in the field two weeks later, and had moved on to something else a few months later.  I haven�t kept a diary, journal, or running commentary of thoughts since I was twelve. Even then, I used to cheat�sometimes filling out entries days in advance: chronicling attendance at predictable events in my life such as trumpet lessons or gym class. *   I think about things all day�yet sometimes writing about them feels like (a) �old news� (writing  about things I�ve already figured out), or (b) a waste of time when I could do more thinking. Odd thing for a professional writer to say, but it�s true.  Generally, I am a very deliberate writer. I like my writing to feel �off the cuff��but I often think about things for days before I start at it. Elements of this feel like learning to walk a tightrope.  We�ll see if this blog stuff is the start of something beautiful or just another brief flirtation.     *=  In an interesting side note: I lost track of this diary in my mid-teens and it was returned to me a few years ago by the current owners of my childhood home. My room in said childhood home (from age ten onwards) was in the attic. Almost as soon as I moved up there, I commandeered an unfinished crawlspace as a hang out. That must have been where I stored/hid the diary. According to the people who bought the house from my parents, they were doing some renovation in the attic and found the diary stashed in between sections of wall insulation. They kindly returned it to my parents. It must have been lost for twenty years.

       New in the CD player (and staying there for the foreseeable future):   urlLink The Yeah Yeah Yeahs    Pending activities:  Vacation in Las Vegas Leaving this weekend--already losing sleep with happiness. You can bet that I'll have plenty of tales from the desert oasis, but I am willing to commit in advance that  none  of my upcoming missives will  (a)  contain the phrase "Vegas baby," or  (b)  include sincere, yet very boring, deep thoughts about Las Vegas's gawdiness.  I'm very excited to go on vacation, basically because it is the only time of year that I'm not working on something. No computer, no phone, no projects, no writing, nothing. Just pancakes for breakfast, cheap prime rib for dinner, quarter slot machines, and lots of booze.  Unless I go out of town with friends who get angry if I work, I  never  stop working. "Vacation" to me is spending time working on what interests me at the moment without the distraction of the things that don't. If I want to be happy and relaxed--I work. That--plus a longer nap every afternoon--is nirvana. Sitting around just makes me crazy. I get four weeks of vacation a year--one week is usually spent in a vacation like this Las Vegas trip, the rest are spent in glorious pursuit of the day when my "to do" list is empty.  That considered, it amazes me how much I enjoy a vacation where I am forced not to do anything. I'm usually testy and easily bored for the first day or so--then I loosen up and have fun. I, literally, forget how nice it feels to relax. Once I take a serious vacation, I learn to appreciate the value of nothingness. I start to understand why so many people try to live in a state of "nothingness" year-round.  I have to admit--I plan to cheat. The book I'm taking to read on the plane and during downtime is by someone I'm going to interview when I get back (James Frey's  A Million Little Pieces ). I don't feel bad about it--the idea to interview him came about after I started reading the book and loving it. Maybe someday I'll take a vacation and settle in with a nice paperback thriller and be numb, but part of me hopes I never have a life I'm so happy to let go of--even for a week. Even though I'm on vacation, I'm still me.

      I was walking through the parking lot today when I saw a bumper sticker that caught my eye:    Support Gun Rights: Criminals Prefer Unarmed Victims    Nice idea; lame argument. Isn't it negated by simply inverting the logic?    Support Gun Control: Victims Prefer Unarmed Criminals

      A few months ago, my girlfriend shared a news item about some jellybeans related to the Harry Potter books, called � urlLink Bertie Bott�s Every Flavor Beans .� Some entrepreneurs thought that producing the tie-in candy would make them a lot of cash, which it did.  What�s the big deal, you ask? Movie tie-ins are ubiquitous�this is nothing new.  Well, you might think that, until you discover some of the flavors of these jellybeans. While they do include some regular flavors like tutti fruiti, banana, and cherry; they also include such tummy tempters as dirt, sardine, earwax, caterpillar, vomit, and booger.  The oddest thing about this whole mess is that the creators of this candy put a lot of thought into how these flavors should taste. In other words, they had in-depth discussions, and multiple taste tests, over the subtleties of what vomit tastes like.  When she told me about these, I was disgusted. Who would willingly eat a jellybean that tastes like grass or rotten eggs? And who would willingly admit that they could identify �booger� when they taste it? Despite several arguments along the lines of �wacky kids will eat anything��I thought the concept was disgusting and couldn�t imagine what idiot would ever eat these.  Perhaps you can guess where this is going�  Yesterday we were in Borders and saw some small boxes of these Bertie Bott beans. My girlfriend immediately bought two�much to my chagrin. But once we got them home and looked over the box, I couldn�t wait to try them. Not only was I suddenly willing, I was eager to taste them all.  So, we did. I tried every one (my girlfriend tried �most� flavors). Both of us kept napkins in our hands to spit out the bean once we got the gist of the flavor (before we created a little vomit of our own).  One of the marketing tactics of these jellybeans is that the packages are randomly mixed, so you have no idea which flavors you�ll get. Further, they only give you a flavor chart for some of the flavors�not all.  Below is my culinary review of the �non-traditional� flavors I sampled:   Dirt:  Within two chews, I had the overwhelming sensation that I had just consumed a mouthful of potting soil. While I don�t make it a habit to eat dirt, I was convinced they had nailed this one dead on.  Sardine:  A late bloomer�I had chewed on this one for a good five seconds before I felt like I was eating raw fish. Amazingly real.  Earwax:  It was obvious that I was eating something that was supposed to taste unpleasant�but it tasted more like soap than what I would imagine of earwax.  Black Pepper:  Dead ringer from the first bite.  Booger:  An overall disappointment. While I now have the bragging rights of saying I ate a booger-flavored jellybean, the thing didn�t have much of a taste. If you are going to eat booger, damnit�make it taste like a booger.  Sadly, our box contained no vomit jellybeans�which I was really gunning for. The vomit beans look almost identical to the tutti fruiti bean. We had three of these�I popped each into my mouth bracing myself to taste vomit�and was disappointed to encounter a pleasant fruit flavor instead. Damn.

      My cat, Buster, has an unusal problem--and the results may be dire: hairy palms, blindness...you know the drill.  Yes, it's true. My cat practices self-love.  Want proof?       Nice, eh?  It started a few years ago. It usually commenses when he is cleaning himself--down there. Then he rolls back his haunches and starts to pat his privates. You might also notice from the photo that Buster is a "plus-size" feline, which is often his undoing. Once he really gets "into it," he falls over on his side from having to reach over his bountiful belly.  When we first noticed him doing it, we couldn't stop laughing. However, one evening, while entertaining friends, we found reason to. Buster walked into the middle of the room, plopped himself down, and started doing the nasty in front of our collected guests.  You could have heard a pin drop in that room. Most of the guests didn't know whether to scream or laugh. Eventually, Buster fell over, got up, and casually sauntered out of the room. All our guests just looked at each other in silence. Someone resumed the conversation where it left off--and the party went on as if nothing had happened.  This continued for about a year, then he stopped doing it. The other morning I was eating breakfast and reading the paper when I looked into the next room and saw Buster curled over in a corner spanking the monkey. Perhaps he continues to do it, but just tries to keep it a private affair.  Ah, the joys of pet ownership.

      I recently read an  urlLink article  about a new exhibit at the nearby  urlLink Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame  called "Hang on Sloopy: the Music of Ohio."  I'm proud of all the great rock music that has come from Ohio. But this exhibit's title is further proof of the incredibly lame and uncomfortable embrace Ohio has on its rock roots.  First off�the title. "Hang On Sloopy" was penned by the McCoys in 1965 and has become a rock classic. Many Ohioans point out McCoys leader Rick Derringer, and several other members of the band, were born in Ohio. In fact, Ohioans are so proud of the association that the  urlLink state legislature passed a bill  making "Hang on Sloopy" the official rock song of Ohio.  As is often the case, the truth about the band, and the song, is not quite as compelling. The McCoys had long left Ohio when they wrote/recorded "Hang On Sloopy" (many bios written on the band don't even mention an Ohio connection).  If anything, it's an example of another great Ohio tradition--going somewhere else to do your great things. (And where did the McCoys go to find greatness--the bright lights of Union City, Indiana!)  Secondly, think about the song itself. Many people mistakenly think the lyric is "Hang on Snoopy." It isn't. The phrase is "Hang On Sloopy." What the hell is a "sloopy," you might ask? Well, according to the dictionary, it is a "mistake" or "someone who makes many mistakes." According to the band, they wrote the song for a girl at their high school (in Indiana, not Ohio) who was a notorious klutz.  Now, should Ohio embrace this song�a testament to a klutz�a mistake? Wait, don�t answer that.  It just goes to show that institutions�governments or Halls of Fame�are lousy places to honor rock and roll. Rock is about a moment, a feeling, a spark. It isn�t something that can be sponsored by AT&T. It isn�t something that can (or should) be made into an "official" anything.

      On May 31st, I should be pretty easy to spot�I�ll be at the only person in Boettler Park in North Canton, Ohio, wearing a red shirt. The red shirt will mark my connection to a man I don�t even know�my grandfather.  My great-uncle Carl (whom I�ve never met) just turned eighty. To celebrate, his granddaughter has decided to hold a family reunion. Carl had several siblings: Albert, Ruth, Richard, Paul (again, all strangers), and my grandfather Raymond. All the Nuzum descendants received invitations to the reunion, on May 31st, and were told to wear different colored shirts to identify which line begat us. Albert�s family will wear orange, Ruth�s will wear green, Carl's kin will wear yellow, Richard�s offspring will be clad in blue, Paul�s in purple, and Raymond�s progeny will wear red.  Both my parents come from divorced homes and both my grandfathers were named Raymond. While they were otherwise very different people, both managed to get themselves estranged from my parents by the time I came around. My mother never looked back, my father did. After struggling through a bitter divorce and years of blaming himself for it, my father finally made peace with his father. Unfortunately, Raymond died soon after. I was six then and though I�m told I visited with him several times (and  think  I remember playing in his backyard), I have no memory of him at all.  Discussion about my grandfathers Raymond was verboten in my home growing up. For my father, the pain of losing his father, reconnecting with him, then losing him again still makes talking about that Raymond very difficult (this discomfort extends to Raymond's family as well--since Raymond's death my father has had no contact with any of my soon-to-be-reuniting relatives). For my mother, her Raymond was an asshole, end of conversation. I said, end of conversation.   On both sides of the family, I know more about our patriarchs from the 19th century than those just a generation removed. All I know is that my mother�s Raymond was an orphan and grew up to be a drill sergeant; my father�s Raymond worked for Goodyear and once lived in Jamaica. That�s it.  A previously unknown cousin called me a few weeks ago to give a heads up about the reunion (an interesting term�seeing I never had a �union� to �re� with these people). She asked me for addresses and phone numbers of a few cousins. I had a few, but was surprised (and a bit embarrassed) that I have no idea how to get in touch with many of my blood relatives. The whole conversation was a bit odd and uncomfortable. The thought of going to this event was making me cringe.  Then my cousin asked how to get a hold of my brother.  I wish, I thought. I mean, I know his address and phone number, but I have no idea how to get a hold of my brother. He has refused to speak to me, or anyone in my family, for more than five years. I�ve tried leaving him messages, but he won�t return them. I gave his information to her and kept the contextual asides to myself.  When I was young, maybe before I was anything, my parents decided that the Raymonds would not have significant roles in my life. That was their choice. I have let them know repeatedly that I should�ve been able to make that decision for myself, but I respect their right to make the decision they felt was in the best interest of their child.   However, now I see them and my brother repeating the mistakes that no one seemed to learn from a generation ago. My brother grew distant from my family after having a rough go with college (it never really caught on) and drugs (they did). He moved to Colorado about a decade ago and became progressively more distant as time went along. Following an odd phone conversation five years ago, he flipped out. He called me back, then called my mother, telling us both that he didn�t want to speak with us again. If anything, he�s a man of his word. Both my mother and I have managed to get him on the phone  once  during that time.  My brother now has a child of his own, who, oddly, I keep in fairly good touch with. However, I live in fear that my brother and nephew will someday repeat this same bullshit once again.  In yesterday�s mail I got a copy of the invitation and have decided to go. I can't control my parents or brother. I can't control our family's past. However, I can work up the nerve to walk into a group of strangers and introduce myself as their cousin and nephew. There will be rigatoni, hot dogs, green beans, and scalloped potatoes. I have the option of bringing a dessert or salad dish. The attendees will hold a white elephant auction once we're done eating. Following, there'll be some massive photo ops. I'll be on my way home three hours later.  None of my immediate family, uncle, or cousins are coming, so I will be the only person wearing red. I'll be the only person to represent Raymond Nuzum, a man I know nothing about; the only one the others can watch to see if any of him made it through to me.  If they notice anything, I hope they tell me. Otherwise, I�d probably never know.

      This was recently posted to the "news" section of  urlLink brucespringsteen.net :     "The Dixie Chicks have taken a big hit lately for exercising their basic right to express themselves, To me, they're terrific American artists expressing American values by using their American right to free speech. For them to be banished wholesale from radio stations, and even entire radio networks, for speaking out is un-American. The pressure coming from the government and big business to enforce conformity of thought concerning the war and politics goes against everything that this country is about - namely freedom. Right now, we are supposedly fighting to create free speech in Iraq, at the same time that some are trying to intimidate and punish people for using that same freedom here at home. I don't know what happens next, but I do want to add my voice to those who think that the Dixie Chicks are getting a raw deal, and an un-American one to boot. I send them my support."

      If you are looking for the article on the Dixie Chicks, it's the entry from March 30th. You can get to it quickly by clicking  urlLink here .  Good news: I recently heard that the  urlLink address I gave in Copenhagen  last fall is going to be included in a book about world censorship (to be published in both English and French- oh la la).  Bad news: It seems that my proposal to do a book on burlesque may be dead in the water. Since I first encountered Exotic World in 1999, I�ve done a few  urlLink articles  and an  urlLink NPR piece  on the people I�ve met. All along, I�ve had the idea to write a book about it all. Over the past eighteen months, I�ve cranked about a killer proposal and about 150 pages of writing--but there isn�t a lot of interest in the current publishing world in a book about a bunch of old strippers and young-former-punk-rock-girls experimenting with the art form. My agent, Marian, is sending it out to a few more people, but it doesn't look promising. There was some interest here and there, but the bottom line reaction has been �interesting idea--good magazine feature--not enough for a book.� So it looks like I may be finished with burlesque.  It�s hard to watch something you�ve cared about for so long start to leave your life. When you write something big, it becomes a part of you. Seeing it come to a close is like losing an arm, or a close friend.   �Continue on,� you say. �If it is good enough for you to envision, why not finish it anyhow.� That is good logic, except this is a very, very expensive project. I�ve already invested a couple grand into this, chasing strippers around the country and purchasing expensive research materials. While I have seen some income from my projects, it doesn�t cover enough of the costs to justify more travel and expense.  So, it isn�t dead yet, but it is definitely on life support.  The bright side is that I have plenty to keep me busy until the next big project rolls around. I have a few essays and profiles I�ve wanted to write, some unfinished radio projects that need completed, and tons of research for projects that only exist in my head. The best projects arise when you aren�t looking for them--and that�s the state of mind I see myself transitioning to right now.  Considering the blessings I have in my life--I'm happy to take one on the chin and not whine about it.

      I just finished a great book, called  urlLink Stiff:The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers , by Mary Roach. Calling a book about dead bodies "hilarious" may seem odd--but it's true. I burned through the whole thing in less than two days. Amazing.   Most organ donor cards list a choice of (a) donating your organs or (b) donating your entire body to research. Half the book is following the adventures of the latter--some of those odd uses for whole cadavers: testing bullet impact, car crash damage, and surgical practice runs. One of my "favorite" uses was the effects of the environment on decomposition. For this, the author hooked up with some university researchers who, literally, lay dead bodies in fields to test how they decompose (the results help forensic examiners determine how long corpses have been laying around or dead).   It reminds me of a time I was walking to the gym and I came across a dead squirrel laying on his back, all four feet sticking straight up in the air. It didn't take long to notice that the feet weren't the only things sticking up in the air--Mr. Squirrel seemed a bit...aroused. It's not that I go around examining the genitals of dead animals, but this squirrel seemed rather, um, well-endowed. This image stuck in my head for several days, until I finally asked someone (I can't remember who, but it felt like someone who would know about the reactions of a penis to death) why the squirrel was in  that  state. Was he in the midst of loving Mrs. Squirrel down when he was caught from behind by an Explorer? Where his last moments remembering those playful times in the oak trees behind my house?  Ends up there is a reason for this--rigor mortis causes any appendage to stiffen--and has a great effect on genitalia because they are so "vascularly oriented." Okay, a bit disturbing, but it makes sense. Since learning about this, I've lived in fear of the next time I go to a human funeral. Perhaps that is why the casket only opens from the chest up--a full viewing would demonstrate that Uncle Bob is sporting a massive hard-on. I haven't attended a funeral yet*, but you know that when I do--I'll be trying my hardest not to think of that damn squirrel.    *=Actually, not true. I have attended a funeral, but it was for a woman.

      I spent the better part of this morning with the television on, periodically checking in as a group of Iraqis citizens and US soldiers spent an hour attempting to pull down a statue of Saddam Hussein in central Baghdad. While the group was trying to figure out how to topple the 20-ft statue, observers would periodically throw their shoes at the statue. While this was happening, the CNN anchor asked a reporter on the scene why people were tossing shoes at the statue.  "Must be some kind of cultural thing," responded the reporter. "They're mad at Saddam, so they throw their shoes."  How insightful, thanks for sharing.  It may be true, but I'm surprised how quickly people write off things they don't understand as "cultural differences" in order to have an answer to why things are the way they are. It's like doing a cognitive pass-off: "I'm unable to figure out this means, so it must be your fault--because you come from a backwards culture that expresses their feelings by throwing shoes." Of course, being a reporter covering a big news story, he couldn't simply say "Paula, I have no idea why they are throwing their shoes." To say that would seem like they didn't have the answer to everything--which wouldn't make for good TV news. On TV news, all the dots have to connect.  On the way into the office this morning I stopped by the grocery store. The guy in line before me was purchasing three very large bottles of laundry detergent, each probably contained about a gallon of liquid soap. As the clerk was scanning the bottles, the guy looked up at me and said, "I sure hate shopping for birthdays."  At first, I simply smiled and nodded my head the way I would when any stranger makes a remark to me in public. But as the day has gone on--I kept thinking about what he said. Was he giving the detergent to someone as a present? Was the detergent an ingredient in some type of celebratory activity? Was he planning to do someone's laundry as a birthday present? Of course, I thought there had to be some connection. Otherwise, it would be similar to me walking into the dry cleaners and announcing, "Damn, I sure love eating yogurt."  It wasn't until I heard the shoe comment that I found some peace. Sometimes it's okay to not have all the answers.

      I can prove the existence of God.    It's easy. All you have to do is subscribe to the dictionary.com " urlLink Word of the Day ." Most people think it is a joke. That is, until they see it work, then they start asking me for the URL to sign-up for their own daily dose of divine intervention. Most people use such services as a way to expand their vocabulary. I use it as a way to commune with the Almighty.      Let me explain.      A perfect illustration occurred last month. The war in Iraq had just started when I received a phone call from a library in Cleveland that had booked me for a speech about censorship. The call was to inform me that the library was canceling the program. "Given current events," said the woman who called, "We don't think it is a good idea to hold a forum about civil liberties."      I asked her for an example of a better time to discuss civil liberties--pointing out that John Ashcroft was trying to push through his  urlLink Patriot Act II  and we were watching our soldiers die on television to protect these rights. She responded that the decision was out of her hands.      I was really bummed out. Of all the places to blink at the thought of protecting free speech--a  library  for Christ sake. If a library will cave at the "patriotism means no questioning authority" mentality that seemed to be gaining strength in America, how long would it be until they carted  me  away as a dissident? Is this an indication that people don�t  care   about their rights anymore?      I was pretty down until my "Word of the Day" arrived in my email. It was:        supposititious  \suh-poz-uh-TISH-uhs\,  adjective:        1.  Fraudulently substituted for something else; not being what it purports to be; not genuine; spurious; counterfeit.       2.  Hypothetical; supposed.       It may seem like just a definition to you--but to me it was heavenly guidance. I interrupted this to mean, "Relax. The library wasn't all that committed to the idea in the first place. They caved too quickly. They are lame. Have no fear." So I went about my life knowing that while I was worried that the cancelled speech as a big deal, God was telling me that it wasn't.   Here are some more examples:   Last fall I was at a work-related conference in Cincinnati. I found myself in the middle of a huge debate over a policy issue. People were in a lather over the subject and worried about the potential negative implications of taking a stand. Just before heading out for another round of discussions, I checked my email. The "Word of the Day" had just arrived. It was:        bootless \BOOT-lis\,  adjective:     Unavailing; useless; without advantage or benefit.      See what I mean? God was telling me that the debate was meaningless ("bootless") and that we shouldn't be worried about the potential fall out.   Messages from God are not a daily occurance in my life, mind you, but it does happen on a fairly regular basis. There was the time I was trying to decide if I should attend a party, when         hobnob  \HAHB-nahb\,  intransitive verb:     To associate familiarly.       showed up as the "Word of the Day."   Or the time that I was trying to decide if I should spend my Saturday afternoon cleaning out my basement or reading a book:        obviate  \OB-vee-ayt\,  transitive verb:     To prevent by interception; to anticipate and dispose of or make unnecessary.       Or when I got into spat with a friend over my "lack of enthusiasm" at meeting her new boyfriend...        querulous  \KWER-uh-luhs; -yuh\,  adjective:        1.  Apt to find fault.       2.  Expressing complaint; fretful; whining.       God was taking my side--telling me that she was being an oversensitive crabby pants. What an endorsement. The kids of Fatima never had it so good.   You may be thinking that this is an intellectual version of horoscopes or tarot cards--but go ahead and mock me. I have no fear. Today's word:        censorious  \sen-SOR-ee-uhs\,  adjective:        1.  Tending to blame, condemn, or criticize; harshly critical.       2.  Implying or expressing harsh criticism or disapproval.     God warned me you'd feel that way.

       From  urlLink TV Spy's Shop-Talk :       When bracing for a New York demonstration aimed at media companies last Thursday, the self-described "fair and balanced" Fox News Channel targeted picketers with the scrolling news ticker, or "zipper," outside its headquarters. The sign's messages included "Does Anyone Here Have A Job?" and "The Cleverest Sign Wins A Week's Free Vacation ... To Baghdad" and a shot at the network's competition: "CNN Agrees With You. They're Two Blocks North And They Have Doughnuts!"...    The rest of the story is equally bothersome, see it  urlLink here .

       The 27 Immutable And Enlightening Declarations of Eric Nuzum   (not in order)        I don&#8217;t have enough time or energy to do everything I want with my life.     Given the choice, I&#8217;ll usually decide to spend time by myself.     I regularly turn concerns into obsessions.     I love movies. In my ideal world, I&#8217;d have the time to watch a different movie every day.     I forgive easily and gladly.     I trust people yet am skeptical of institutions.     I spent my teenage years in a near constant haze of drug use, yet&#8212;as an adult&#8212;have little tolerance for inebriation and illicit substance use.     I strive to be a generous person.     I am an opponent of smoking and smokers&#8217; rights, yet I steal (and smoke) cigarettes from my girlfriend almost nightly.     I admire passion.     I am oddly proud to be part of the &#8220;Gen X&#8221; demographic group.     Learning invigorates me.     I love my brother dearly though we haven&#8217;t spoken in almost three years.     From the ages of seven to thirteen, I listened to Casey Kasem&#8217;s  American Top 40  every week and charted the top records on a notepad. I considered this important work.     I enjoy meeting new people.     I don&#8217;t like telephones. If it weren&#8217;t for work and family emergencies I would never use them.     I want to love unconditionally and often fail.     I am a fan of nostalgic kitsch.     I have been dating the most intelligent and beautiful woman in the world for eight years. We have no plans to marry or have children&#8212;yet are not idealistically opposed to any of those concepts.     I believe everything happens for a reason.     I don&#8217;t like cats, yet the only pet I have is a six-year old cat that I&#8217;ve raised since his mother abandoned him when he was two-days old (probably for good reason). He is unpredictable and mean. I consider his presence in my life as a lesson to me, yet I&#8217;m still trying to figure out what that lesson is. My girlfriend and I both have scars from his tantrums.     I gravitate to reading non-fiction. I feel there are so many interesting and compelling stories in the real world&#8212;why waste time with stuff that&#8217;s made up?     I don&#8217;t tolerate fools well.     I sincerely believe in the existence of God, yet also believe it is impossible for humans to understand or quantify that existence.     I am very proud of my accomplishments.     I am easily bored.     I hate zucchini and consider it evil. Seriously.

      Had an interesting experience this weekend that, once again,   a) proves the existence of God, and  b) that He routinely puts thoughts in my head (and usually quite trivial thoughts, at that).  Last weekend I was reading  Entertainment Weekly , and every time I put it down it kept flipping open to a page at the end with a woman's picture on it. I mean--it did this six times, at least. When I finally read through that section--it was the book section. I looked at the page with the picture on it--and I swear, before I read a single word, I had this idea in my head that it was my friend S----'s friend, Hillary, who S---- briefly mentioned (two years ago) had written a memoir. I've never seen Hillary, didn't know her name, nor what the book was about--but I was completely sure that this was it.  So, anyhow. I found this amusing. So amusing that when I was in Border's last night I immediately went to the new releases table and picked it up. Then, I opened it to the very page that mentions S----'s annual trip home to the Ice Cream Social in Hudson, Ohio.  While God might want me to know about this book, He definitely wouldn't want me to buy it at full price from Borders! So, I ordered it when I got home.  Oh...the book is  urlLink Candy and Me: A Love Story  and Hillary's full name is Hillary Lifton. Seems that it is being marketed as part of the "chick lit" trend--but it does look like a fun read.

      Current read:  urlLink  Reefer Madness    A book by Eric Schlosser, author of the classic  urlLink  Fast Food Nation  . It is an exploration of three segments of the underground black market enconomy in the United States, specifically pot, porn, and cheap labor. It isn't quite as good as  Fast Food Nation , but it is still a fascinating read.  It is hard for me to read the first section of  Reefer Madness , about marijuana, and remain objective. For reasons too elaborate for me to illustrate here, I am an adament opponent of drug use. Even though I would normally be judged a liberal-quickly-approaching-radical, I think that drugs are poison and anyone who partakes is a slave and a fool. Drugs don't free your mind, relax you, or put you more in touch with anything--they just create the illusion of those things. That is a pretty serious distinction. Kind of like the difference between living in the Matrix and living in the real world.  But I drink, which often strikes people as hypocritical. Yes, but I do drink alcohol, but never allow myself to drink enough to get drunk. There is a difference. Show me a pot smoker who smokes--but never smokes enough to get high--and I'll take that back.  I'm not "hard core" about many things, but this is definitely one of them.  That aside, the book is a fascinating examination of the legal and economic impact of marijuana (and other elements of the underground) on American life.

      This past Thursday and Friday, I was in Los Angeles auditioning to be the host of a new public radio program, called  urlLink Public Radio Weekend . I did some segments for the pilot and the producers were interested in having me audition for larger role in the ongoing program. Before I had even left Los Angeles, I was told I wasn't going to get it. "You don't want it bad enough," I was told. This is an unusual statement, because it is true. Much more true than even I was aware of.  At lunch about two hours after the in-studio audition, I was told that I was very entertaining and funny, but that I didn't seem to have a passion for the project. When I asked what led them to that conclusion, the executive producer asked me what I wanted to do in fifteen years.  In answering, I stumbled around for a few minutes and gave non-committal answer that was completely lacking in clear thought or content. As soon as I did, I realized his point: I have a lot going on right now...somethings could grow into big things, somethings won't, but it will be difficult for me to excel at any of them without some focus. Mostly, focus means giving up on some things.  I think if I  really  had my dream in fifteen years, it would be living on a non-working farm in some rural area about 60-90 minutes outside a huge metropolitan area. I think I'd be very active in the small community where I lived, but I wouldn't work there. I'd spend most of my time on the farm, probably with a small family, and venture out into the real world periodically to research and gather information for insightful, witty, and original books and public radio features. Then I'd retreat back to the farm to create said items for the eventual joy and acclaim of those who would read/listen to them. I would, of course, be wildly successful at these pursuits, thus financing the above lifestyle. I don't need to be rich, just able to do the above.  However, as the producer hinted (then, later, said flat out), sometimes having a variety of pursuits and interests means you don't achieve your highest potential level of success with them. It's true, but with the uncertainty of sustainable success in any of my hobbies/vocations--I always feel that if I let go of one,  that  will be the one I would have been most successful doing.  I guess it comes down to figuring out what I want to do with the rest of my life. I've been working in public radio, as a producer and programmer, for the past ten years--and I'm ready to do something else. My problem isn't having options, it's having too many. Which, in many ways, is worse. The burlesque book I've been writing seems to be breathing life again (one possible career path), I could go to another station or network within public radio to pursue work as a producer and programmer (stay the current "career" course), or I could continue to build my work as a writer and reporter for public radio (very fun, but very, very, very, very little money in it).  After thinking about this for a few days, I have no better idea how to proceed--but at least I'm aware of my problem. Hey, if I was an alcoholic, I'd have just completed my first-of-twelve steps.

      At lunch time today I was watching CNN and they had a story about a woman who was recently arrested on an outstanding six-year-old warrant.  Her crime? Not returning a rented video game.  It seems this lady rented a copy of   Frogger six years ago and (allegedly) never returned it. The store then pressed charges. The woman was pulled over on a traffic violation this past weekend and ended up spending five hours  in shackles  until she could post bail. According to her, she did rent the game, returned it, and has lived the past six years never knowing there was any problem.  That's the thing that keeps sticking in my head--never knowing. Ever since lunch, I've been reviewing the past several years of my life over and over in my head. I've been worried that perhaps  I  have unknowingly committed some petty crime that I've never known about and am "wanted" as a result. Wondering "Did I borrow a carpet sample and never return it? How about using the pen at the bank counter and accidentally pocketing it on the way out? Maybe I took one too many free samples at the grocery?"  I actually did something similar to this once. When I was in college I went to a gas station and filled up my car--then drove away. About five minutes later I realized what I had done and (my mother would be so proud) drive back to the gas station to settle up. Before the cashier took my money, she called the sheriff's department to make sure they could be called off (seriously). We cleared it up, but I did drive around for the next few weeks concerned that some dispatch person hadn't processed the call correctly and if I drove past the five-oh I'd mistakenly end up on an episode of  Cops .  So, if some night I call for bail--it isn't because of murder, drugs, or organized crime--it's that damn library fine I never paid...honestly.

      Today, for the first time in eight years, I purchased a new car. It's a  urlLink Honda CR-V . And yes, it is an SUV.  While I'll probably start freaking out tomorrow about making car payments again, today--I'm really stoked.  I'm usually not into driving, but now--it's the long route to everywhere.

      So I've been doing this blog thing for about six weeks, and I think it is working out pretty well.  In order to see if anyone ever reads this thing (about two dozen people a day do), I run statistics reports on this area of my web site. One of the reports I can run is a search engine referral--in other words, what Google or Yahoo searches led people to my blog.  Here is a sampling of some of the searches people have done--and ended up at my blog as a result:   "nephew spanking"   "wife screwing"  "vomit machine" "booger taste"   "cousin dessert" "destroying patriotism"   Wow, I never realized I had such a colorful existence...wouldn't my mother be proud.

      The other evening one of my friends cut to the chase:  "Why is it that every time I suggest we go to a concert, you get that look on your face like I'm asking you to eat dog shit?"  The observation is true, over the past year I have developed a distaste for going to concerts. To the point that I rarely attend concerts at all (I think I've been to one so far this year).  At first I wrote off my growing distaste to my recent stint as a music critic. Following the completion of my book  urlLink Parental Advisory  I decided to devote some of my writing efforts to rock journalism until I found a new book project. Starting out at any publication, you cover the stuff that no one else wants to do--usually concerts by pop artists or old, haggard has-beens. That was my beat. Though I took it all in stride, I eventually got really sick of it. As my stature at the paper grew, I begged off all concert reviews. After a while, I quit the paper all together.*  After that was over, I still was attending concerts, but was growing less and less interested in them. That was when the "I'm getting old" theory emerged: thinking that staying out until 3 am to see a band (and the resulting dead feeling the day after) wasn't something my body and spirit were up to anymore. Basically, while I hadn't given in to "The Man"--I was still working his hours. Complicating this even further is the fact that I am a morning person--used to waking up at 5:30 am and enjoying the most productive part of my day. Rock musicians, by and large, are not morning people--so the concert thing does feel like a square peg. But eventually, that theory didn't hold water--I was even avoiding concerts on weekends.  Then I just came out of the closet--nine times out of ten, the concert is a totally disappointing experience. Usually because the performance I see on a stage pales in comparison to the one I hear when I listen to a CD.  Despite Brian Eno's statements that you never hear the same piece of music twice (the idea is that environmental factors such as noise, acoustics, and other sounds in the listening area actually become part of the experience's uniqueness), a musical performance captured on a recording is the definition of predictable and dependable. I never worry that James Brown isn't going to hit that note, that Bernard Summner is going to break a string, or that Karen O is going to forget the lyrics. My CDs never have bad nights, my CDs never get pissed off at hecklers and eject from the player, and they never lose their fidelity as they age.  While it feels a bit lame to say this--they never change. On the other hand, I do change. I do have moods, I do age, I do have bad days. When I listen to my favorite music--to the power captured there--it reminds me of how I felt the first time I heard it, how alive I felt, how excited. If even for a moment--it draws me back to that point.  To the counter, nothing ruins that connection to a piece of music like seeing a bad performance of it. There have been occasions in my life where I permanently shelved a CD that I loved simply because I'd seen the performer mutilate it.  Even though I was supposed to outgrow my romance with music long ago, there is still a part of me that likes to consider musicians to be superheroes--incapable of the fallacies and nomalities of ordinary people. When I see a concert, that bubble usually gets burst. It ruins the romance.   Why would I want to do that?    *=Actually, my tenure as a rock critic ended because of my frustration with the paper I wrote for, The Cleveland Free Times. The source of those frustrations ended up forcing the paper to close down four months after I left.

      It happened when I was eight years old. I was hanging out with my friends, minding my own business, when God dropped a stack of Playboys from the sky. Or at least that is what I thought at the time.  I grew up on a dead end street in North Canton, Ohio. On the other side of that dead end was a twenty foot drop off, some railroad tracks, and a small stream. We loved to hang out at "the tracks" because all of our parents forbid us from going there, thinking we'd end up dead and flattened like strategically placed pennies. The truth was that trains hardly ever used those tracks. They were largely unkept, cluttered with weeds and bits of garbage that had made their way over the guard rail at the end of the street above.  We'd lie to our parents, saying we were all going to each others houses, and venture down to the end of the street, climb over the rail, traverse our way down through the wild trees and overgrown grass and weeds, then end up on a small patch of dirt that ran along the tracks.  Most days, we'd just hunt for bugs, beat the dirt (or each other) with sticks, or dare each other to go wading into the nasty, smelly, vein of mud that was trying to pass itself off as a stream. Every once in a while our fun was interrupted with noise from the street above. Any time a car came all the way to the end of the road, we were convinced it was the police, there to cart us off to jail for hanging out by the tracks (which we were convinced had to be illegal). When we'd hear a car or adult approaching, we'd slam our bodies against the incline (hoping that someone casually looking over the edge wouldn't notice us) and stay quiet and still.  So, what does all this have to do with little Eric's introduction to pornography?  One afternoon about five of us, ages six to nine, were hanging out doing...well, probably doing nothing. We heard a car driving up fast.  "Cops!" someone yelled. We all dashed out of view as quickly as possible. The car screeched to a halt so close to the edge that it sent loose dirt and gravel raining down on our heads. We heard a man and woman screaming at each other in what sounded like Greek. Then we heard a man's voice coming close to the guard rail.  "Here," he yelled in English. "Are you happy now?"  Boom. A large package landed in front of us and exploded. It was a paper grocery bag full of magazines and photos.  We heard the man, still screaming at the woman in Greek, get back in his car and speed away.  We stayed frozen, not quite sure what to make of what just happened. After a minute or so, we ventured forth to examine the bounty from above that had just landed two feet in front of us. It was full of Playboys, Penthouses, and glossy photos of naked women.  When you are a young boy, nudie magazines are the ultimate currency, like beaver pelts to a frontiersman. If you fished your old man's copy of Playboy out of the garbage, you could use if as exchange for gum, comic books, toys, or almost anything. It bought favors or could be used as hush money. It didn't matter how ratty, worn, mutilated, or illegible--for whatever you wanted, a girlie mag was solid gold. And fate/God/an angry Greek man had just provided us with the little boy equivalent of Fort Knox.  We immediately knew that if hanging out at the tracks would put us in prison, being in possession of such illicit loot would surely get us the chair--so we went about gathering the photos and magazines, then scouted out a place to hide them. After several discarded attempts, we finally settled on putting the magazine in a freshly dug hole, covering it with dirt, then rocks, then tree branches, and then more rocks. Each morning we'd met down at the tracks, post lookouts, then unearth our buried treasure, silently passing them around for about a half hour before reburying them until the next day.   Your perspective towards porn is quite different before you hit puberty then after. Before, pictures of naked women are the forbidden fruit--totally off limits. There was a great deal of interest in seeing them, but once you'd done so, that was kind of it. To an eight-year-old, once you've seen one boob, you've seen them all. So over time, we'd only unbury them every couple days, then once a week. Following a particularly rainy stretch of days, we didn't even bother. We were convinced they had melted or something.  Towards the end of the summer, I was playing alone down at the tracks and thought about digging up the pictures and magazine. I went to the spot--and they were gone. Someone either had discovered them, stolen them, or perhaps the cops finally showed up and took them in as evidence. The only thing left was the hole. I immediately suspected one of my friends had gotten them--but no one ever confessed nor did any of them show up again.  The strangest thing is that I can still, to this day, can meticulously describe the women I looked at, the cartoons I viewed, and the stories I read (it took me years to figure out what a "cooter" was).

      I was paying for groceries the other day and when a woman walked up to the cashier and asked if the store had a deli department.  The woman making the query was wearing purple shorts, a pink top, one pink sock, one purple sock, and looked like she had just rolled out of bed. In other words--she was either very comfortable with her appearance or a tad bit crazy.  The cashier looked at her as if she had asked to have sex with her grandchildren.  "Of course we do," she replied, lowering her gaze down to the conveyor belt. "This  is  a grocery store." She accented her last statement with a roll of her eyes and a finger extended towards the back corner of the store.  Even though the cashier didn't allow eye contact with the woman, she did watch the woman intently as she walked back toward the deli. After she was out of sight, she turned to me, shook her head several times and huffed--a "can you imagine the nerve" kind of huff.  I guess I was kind of revolted by the harsh and quick judgment this cashier had made. I had seen the cashier interact pleasantly with several other customers--but apparently based solely on the woman's appearance (and, I assume the audacity of a completely legitimate question), the cashier treated her like shit.  I found this especially odd for two reasons:  1) The cashier's two accessories (other than earrings and her nametag) were a hand-made yarn-on-plastic crucifix and an American flag pin. I won't get to deep into the "do not judge" or "love thy neighbor" stuff--but it's there. And regarding the flag--I thought those were a sign we were all in this together. The woman wasn't Glamour-rific, but she wouldn't have been mistaken for Osama bin Laden either.  2) This appearance-based judgment seemed odd coming from her, with her plain features and ass as wide as an SUV. Not to say that anyone who doesn't stack up to Elle McPhearson isn't entitled to an opinion--but those in glass houses shouldn't be giving smart ass directions to the deli department.

      The other night I was in a hotel room scanning through the channels when I came across a new low in reality television (is that an oxymoron?). The show was called  urlLink  Cheaters  .  The premise of  Cheaters  is pretty simple. People who suspect their loved one is being unfaithful call up the  Cheaters  crew, who then spy on the alleged philanderer, and you get to watch the whole thing--including the inevitable bitch fight/screaming match/confrontation that caps every episode.  Like most reality television shows, the first time you see it, a mix of voyeuristic awe and love of spectacle keeps you glued to the television. This was no exception. On this particular episode of  Cheaters  we met a man who suspected his wife (and mother of his two children) of cheating. The  Cheaters  crew videotaped some guy coming over to the house every time the husband stepped out (including some grainy video tape of the wife screwing the late-night visitor). When confronted (following the fist fight), the mystery-man-on-the-side pulled a gun on the husband and  Cheaters  crew. Of course, the  Cheaters  crew openly manipulated the situation (and the individuals) for every bit of melodrama possible.  The highlight of this show was a look back to the  Cheaters  archive--where the crew visits the subject of a previous snoop. In this case, this guy (unapologetically unemployed) was caught cheating on his wife (and the mother of his kid) with her best friend (who was now pregnant by him). When they visited him again, he said that he and his wife were trying to work it out. He said, "We're meeting half way: Sasha is gonna try to lose weight and I'm gonna try to stop cheatin'."  He also offered the following reflection on his Cheaters experience: "To Sasha, I say--you brought this on yourself by gaining so much weight. To Cheaters, I say--fuck you. To America, I say--don't mess around with crazy, fat, white women."  Wow, what a catch. Stand by your man, Sasha.  Most odd of all, as I prepared to write this, I visited the  urlLink  Cheaters  web site . Not only do they have info on the show, but they operate a dating service as well. Imagine the people who would use the official  Cheaters  dating service--must use it as fodder for the show.

       Okay, we're back. Had a great time, blah, blah, blah.  While in Las Vegas we visited the one mega-casino that wasn't open on our last visit,  urlLink Aladdin's .   As seems the tradition on the new Las Vegas strip, when you build a mega-casino, you attach a huge shopping mall-like complex to it. Each of these massive malls has several gimmicks to make you think your in a mall that is a cut above the mall in your local town. For example, Aladdin's Passage is set up like a street in a city (much like Caesar's Palace and The Venetian), complete with faux sky and weather. In one area, it even rains every hour, on the hour.  One of the smaller attractions is several actors, in white costumes and white face paint, posing on pedestals as statues (you may have seen similar things in New Orleans, New York, or the occasional pathetic local art fair). These statues stand perfectly still while gobs of tourists stand around to watch them...do nothing.  If you give the Aladdin's statutes a dollar, they will move to a different position (ooh). If you give them a dollar and stand next to them, they might even re-pose to touch you (aah). Actually, it is a somewhat frightening prospect (see below).        As with anything novel in Las Vegas, these statues were incredibly popular. Though you can't tell from the picture, there were at least four dozen people standing around staring at this statue. Every time it would move, people would erupt in whispered recognition and awe.  A day or two later one of my travel companions noticed something odd. The hotel we always stay at, the Golden Nugget, is a great place--but anywhere else its brass and faux Greek garden theme would make your stomach turn (in Vegas, it is a pleasant break in routine). My friend noticed an old woman walking across the Golden Nugget restaurant with a dollar bill in her hand.  She was walking towards a  real  statue in the restaurant waving a dollar at it in order to encourage it to move.  Las Vegas may be able to convince you that you have a chance of winning money. It may also convince you that you are a "player" deserving of special treatment and all the grandeur that such a classy environment has to offer. But I don't think they've been able to bring faux marble statues to life. Then again, if there is a way they can con a dollar out of you--it may only be a matter of time.

      It's almost universal: If I'm ordering something from a catalog or calling tech support--they always have the same reaction to my answer to the city where I live.  "You mean  the  Kent, Ohio? Where they shot those kids?"  "Yes," I patiently reply, "that Kent, Ohio."  It was thirty-three years ago today, about 300 yards from where I am typing this, that thirteen Kent State students were shot (four were killed) when a group of Ohio National Guardsmen fired into a crowd of antiwar demonstrators. Even though it happened more than a generation ago--Kent State University, the city of Kent, and anyone associated with either, was permanently and painfully changed by that day. Today, evidence of the May 4th shootings is no where and everywhere at the same time. Each year, on May 4th, it's at its worst--still. It has the feeling of pulling off a scab. If I try to (or accidentally) forget that it's May 4th, I'm quickly reminded when hundreds of cars park along the streets, curious visitors amass by the thousands, and the Cleveland TV news helicopters buzz my house to get video of the annual remembrances.  Personally, I have a textbook love/hate relationship with the events and impact of the May 4th Kent State shootings. For one, they are my earliest memory. I was almost four then and was living with my parents (both Kent State alum) in Canton, Ohio, about twenty miles south of Kent. I remember walking into my family's living room and both of my parents were standing in front of the television crying. My mother grabbed for me and held me close, then tried, as best she could, to explain what had happened in a way that a toddler could understand. The most vivid image I have is of the television showing soldiers walking across a field wearing gas masks. I didn't know there were people under those masks and assumed they were monsters attacking all the people who were running around them. It scared the shit out of me.  As I grew older and understood what had happened, I read everything I could find about the shootings. To me, they epitimized everything that was wrong with government, war, authority, and so on. When I came here to college one of the first things I did to get involved was attend lectures about the shootings. Unfortunately, the more I learned, the less I respected several of the survivors and the people who work to remember the shootings.  "Survivor" is a terrible term to use for several of the most active May 4th crew. For many, their lives stopped on May 4th, 1970, and almost everything they've done since has been an echo of that day. As easy as it would be to fault them for this, I can't. I cannot imagine what it would be like to be exercising your Constitutional right to free speech and assembly on a college campus in East Buttfuck, Ohio, just to see those around you slaughtered by these guardsmen. Few things could be more tramatic.  However, every year, including today, the walking wounded assemble on the Commons at Kent State, ring the bell, read the names, and sit through a painful, hours-long ramblings from representatives of any leftist cause. It is a pathetic display of those who never moved on, or think that their assembled presence means anything.  If I am ever shot and killed in terrorist attack/terrible accident/whatever, I would encourage those who care for me to never go back to that place to mark an anniversary, dedicate a memorial, or be part of any rememberance. If they want to show a testimony for my life, I hope they would go out and do something--read to a kid, clean up a park, volunteer at a center, plant a tree--anything other than stand around. If ever called to do so, I hope they'd just move on.  If it happened to them, that's what I'd do.

      I've been planning to go through what remains of my old vinyl album collection. I'm not even quite sure what's there anymore. Some were sold off to pay bills, others disappeared thanks to former roommates or roommates' friends, and most others were lost when they were loaned out and never returned. While I once had several hundred albums�the current number is well under 100. The ones that remain are largely the ones that no one wanted to steal, borrow, or buy�not exactly the pick of the litter. Even still, every once in awhile I'll get a hankering to listen to an old albums, especially odd considering that--after past pings of nostalgia--most of these left-overs are not nearly as good as I remember them.  Today I thought of an album I bought when I was in my early teens, struggling (unsuccessfully) to emerge from a heavy metal fixation that lasted until I was about sixteen. The album was Alice Cooper's   urlLink Flush The Fashion   (I told you...).  The album is pretty pathetic and really wasn�t that musically important to me. I bought it because a friend had it and I liked the song "Clones" (I was just discovering new wave and thought this qualified*). However, the real reason I bought it was the back cover. The back cover featured a photo of Alice looking rather gaunt and heroin chic. I remember thinking it was exceptionally cool that he had let an eighth-inch sliver of beard grow in down the side of his check. Awesome.  The photo fascinated me for the same reason that (at that time) the Sex Pistols fascinated me. It had little to do with music, and everything to do with how much they frightened me. Alice Cooper looked scary to a fourteen year old boy�just like Sid Vicious and Johnny Rotten looked as if they came straight out of a 1960s horror film. I loved 1960s horror films�so I thought these guys rocked before I'd ever heard them.  It's so funny to look at that Alice Cooper back cover today. Looking at that cover twenty years ago, I remember thinking, "This is what a drug addict looks like. Scary!" I look at pictures of Alice Cooper today and I think, "This is what dentures and jet black hair dye look like. Scary!"   *= At the time, Alice Cooper was really struggling with his career. For this album I think he was trying to model himself into David Bowie, even though David Bowie was pretty much done being David Bowie by that point.

      It has been a big week for new releases--which is nice because things have been so quiet lately (musically speaking). I was so desperate for something new to listen to that I recently purchased a few used Van Halen CDs--now that is a cry for help!  I really enjoy the 2003 version of 1983 found on  urlLink Goldfrapp's  Black Cherry  . It is brainless joy.  I originally passed up  urlLink Rilo Kiley's  Execution of All Things  , but a friend encouraged me to give it another chance. I'm glad I did--a great hybrid of several styles.   In the DVD player:   urlLink  Punch Drunk Love  . I have loved every one of Paul Thomas Anderson's movies, even  Magnolia , and this one didn't disappoint at all. Typical odd storyline, rich characters, and occasional episodes of humor brought about because you are clueless about what is happening on the screen--though the payoff is always there. Highly recommended.

      New in the CD player:  urlLink Four Tet's  Rounds   (awesome) and  urlLink Mars Volta's  De-Loused in the Comatorium   (also awesome).  I also bought  urlLink Liz Phair's new self-titled album  but after only one listen I've already determined that it's the worst record I've heard in recent memory...make that long memory. This is totally depressing. I had read the advance press about this album (very, very pop: produced by Michael Penn, some songs co-written with The Matrix) and figured it couldn't be  that  bad. It is. Not that hearing a bad record is, in itself, depressing (otherwise, I would have committed suicide long ago). It's just that Liz Phair is just about every alt rocker's ideal woman. Smart, sexy, blunt, can write songs that are infinitely feminine but don't sound girly, insists on playing a vintage, beat-up guitar...you get the picture.  Now she poses for the CD cover naked with said beat-up guitar--which now, like herself, has been relegated to the role of prop. A crying shame.

      I've been thinking a lot about jukeboxes lately and I've come to the conclusion that they are the ultimate form of democracy--for the same reason that they are also an example of marketing genius.   Outside of walls that change color or morph-able furniture, jukeboxes create the perfect self-selected environment. They encourage people to pay money to entertain themselves (read: marketing genius), and (unless someone drops a few bucks on the machine and leaves) the selection are always a perfect match to the clientele.  If you walk into a bar and hear Lynard Skynrd and Guns N Roses--it is more effective than a neon sign--it instantly tells you something about the bar patrons and what you can assume are the proper decorum for this environment. Conversely, if you walk into a bar playing "Sweet Caroline," the B-52s, and a host of other 80s hits, you can expect a somewhat different experience.   Recently a friend and I spent an evening in bar here in town and I was fascinated to watch how the jukebox selections changed over the course of the evening. When we arrived, it was mostly townies and people watching sports games, eating dinner, etc... The juke selections during this time were mostly classic oldies, some light R&B, and current hits. As the evening went on, most of the earlier crowd left and gaggles of young women (and the young men desperate to pick them up) arrived. Slowly the music changed--lots of danceable songs, "oldies" (for this crowd, oldies meant 1998), and frat staples like Dave Matthews Band and Jimmy Buffet. Same bar, same jukebox--yet a totally different sound and vibe.  If all this is true (and of course, it is) then one of the most common comments about jukeboxes has no basis in fact, whatsoever: "This jukebox sucks." No, it isn't the jukebox that is doing the sucking. Jukeboxes are a perfect reflection of the establishment that contains them and the people that go there. Think about it for a minute--can you think of any jukebox that was a bad match for its location? Of course not. Think about who is stocking the selections--the same person who picked out the wall color and designed the bar.  Whenever you hear someone complain about the selections on the jukebox, they are really complaining about the establishment and the people there.

      It's time for me to publically "come out"...I am an introvert.  Most people who know me are surprised when I claim to be an introvert. It took years before I could embrace this myself. That's probably because of the mental image I have of an introvert--which would be synonomous with a recluse. But that isn't true of me at all. It shows itself in little ways: my hatred for talking on telephones, disinterest in spending time in large groups, etc...  I love people, I love being around people, I love meeting new people...I just love them all in short doses. To me, time alone is like sleep: fundamentally essential and can ruin (or at least diminish) almost everything if I don't get enough.  My girlfriend is exactly the opposite--she thrives on interaction with people. When she wants to be stimulated, she has a conversation. When she wants to relax, she has a conversation. When she wants to think through a problem...you get the point. She isn't a chatterbox, not at all--in fact, she has a unique way of making almost anything sound interesting when seen through her eyes.  I think the reason so many people find this "introvert" thing troubling is that both my radio and print writing (including this blog) tends to be very public, personal, and open--but that, again, is misunderstanding what it means to be an introvert. I don't mind sharing almost anything about myself, I just don't want to hang around afterward.  Those who have been annoyed by this have accused me of being one (or more) of several things. First is antisocial. As I have stated above, nothing could be further from the truth. I love my friends and love spending time with then. But with me, it's quality, not quantity. At other times, I've been accused of being a control freak--that I don't like situations (like large groups) where I am not in control. I am, in fact, a control freak, but I don't think it manifests itself in that way(and stop thinking that it does--NOW). Yet another analysis is that I am a narcissist--so centered on myself that I cannot bear listening to others. Sometimes, I actually think there is truth to this. I tend to get  very  animated and engaged in conversations and like discussing issues and ideas with people. Sometimes I get so wound up that I'm functioning at a mile a minute. Other people usually aren't--so I get frustrated waiting for them to spit out a concrete idea.  More than anything, I think I just enjoy spending time by myself (or at home with my girlfriend). No dark secrets or inner turmoil--that's just the way I prefer it.  Now go away.

      So one evening, during my college years, a friend and I were out drinking and went back to his apartment to hang out after last call. By the time we got there, we were really hungry--so we raided his kitchen. The only thing he had to eat was a box of Nerds cereal.  If you are unfamiliar with the entire Nerds concept--it originally started as a candy. The box was divided into halves, with one half containing candy that was pink, the other half containing candy that was purple. I believe, as time went on, Nerds came in different colors/flavors--but that isn't important here.  The cereal was similarly themed--the box contained two bags of cereal. Since there was just the two of us, we each picked a color (I selected pink, my friend went for purple), grabbed some bowls and milk, and chowed down.  The rest of the evening went, pretty much, as you'd expect and nothing seemed out of the ordinary--until my friend called me the next morning.  "Hello," I answered.  "Hey it's me...have you taken a shit yet?" he queried.  "Ah...no...I haven't," I replied.  "Well, take a shit and then call me back," he said, hanging up the phone.  Now, despite the odd circumstances of the request, I did my best to comply. It wasn't until several minutes after I was properly enthroned that I realized my body had no need to defecate. I waited around for about an hour, had a few snacks, then felt things moving along as I had hoped.  As I was doing my business I wondered, albeit for the first time, what might come out of me that would prompt an immediate phone call. Turning around and looking in the bowl brought out a feeling of dreadful anticipation usually reserved for investigating strange noises in the night.  To my shock and horror--I noticed that my feces bore a distinct pinkish hue. The following phone call to my friend confirmed that he had a similar movement, only his bore a purple hue.  Figuring that the worst of the experience was behind us (literally), we didn't think there was much to do about the matter. A few days later I did send a letter to Ralston-Purina (the cereal's manufacturer) complaining about the amount of dye that had to be present in that cereal in order to produce such a reaction.  I did get a letter back from them a few weeks later--complete with coupons for a few free boxes of Nerds cereal.

      As part of my burlesque research, I've watched the film  urlLink Teaserama  a few times. If you aren't familiar with it, it is basically a collection of striptease routines performed by Bettie Page and Tempest Storm. They strip in some living room, stopping a few times to pose or twist around for the camera, smile a lot, and move on to the next scene (which is pretty much the same as the last).  What strikes me about this movie is that when it was released it was considered to be the 1950's version of pornography. It was considered scandalous and racy. Watching it today, however, it is  unbelieveably  slow and boring.  Case in point: During one scene Tempest Storm performs a "reverse" striptease--basically starting off in lingerie and slowly putting her clothes back on. Here is how the action goes...*  0:00 - 01:00 - Tempest is asleep on a sofa bed,wakes, sits up, rubs eyes, gets out of bed. 01:00 - 03:00 - Tempest makes bed, folds up bed, fluffs and places pillows (yes two minutes of this) 03:00 - 03:30 - Tempest puts on robe. 03:30 - 04:00 - Bettie Page shows up and both women nod their heads at each other as if in a conversation. 04:00 - 05:00 - Bettie brushes Tempest's hair. (Okay, just to check in - five minutes have gone by...and look at what has (or in this case--hasn't) happened. That may not seem like much to you, but watching this, it feels like twenty minutes). 05:00 - 06:30 - Tempest takes off robe and puts on hosery. Bettie watches, then checks hosery straps. 06:30 - 07:00 - Bettie brings out dress, she and Tempest admire dress, nod heads. 07:00 - 09:00 - Bettie helps Tempest into dress, lightly runs fingers along seams. 09:00 - 10:00 - Tempest spins around and puts on fur muffler. Both women walk off stage.  Wow.   While I was supposed to be paying attention--at several points I'd get up to go to the bathroom, get a soda, or check the answering machine--just to return and find out that I hadn't missed anything.  I understand that sometimes the best teases are slow--but come on...at least keep me awake!   * - The unit of time is in minutes, so 01:00 is one minute.

      I know a lot of people have odd pastimes, but I have a periodic pursuit that (I'm sure) isn't shared by many--obsessive web searches. I'll get a hankering to figure out some arcane piece of knowledge and search obsessively for it--sometimes for days. My most infamous one was finding the artist and title for a song that kept popping up in commercials and movie trailers. It was VAST's "Touched." I think I started that search with "song with choir and acoustic guitar in it" and went from there. It took me almost a week of searching several hours a day.  Today, I started on another. Earlier tonight I spent over an hour searching to find the name of the guy who is the Toyota spokesman in the "Oh, what a feeling" commercials. He was in every single Toyota commercial (it seemed) for years, then disappeared about five years ago. Tonight, I saw a new Toyota commercial starring that guy. Same guy, but obviously a bit older--and now he's dyeing his hair.  Unfortunately...no luck. I can't even find a photo of the guy (and yes, I've checked all the advertising, commercial archives, and even Toyota official and fan sites). For a while, I thought it was former football player Pat Studstill. But after looking for a contemporary picture of Mr. Studstill for half an hour--I gave up. The guy in the commercial isn't too jock looking.  On an interesting sidenote, I did find a bit of controversy over the promotion of Toyota's new Rav4. In order to market the car as "hip," Toyota created an ad that featured a smiling black guy with gold teeth. Embedded in the gold teeth was the text "R A V 4." The African-American community found the ad neither hip nor funny.

      I've realized that I have reached a point in my life where, if speaking with young kids, I can tell tales of my youth that will bring looks of utter confusion and disbelief. The kind of looks I gave to my parents and their friends when they'd discuss growing up without a television or wrinkle-free fabrics.  In the course of my life the following have been added to everyday American existence--and leave younger Americans perplexed as to how we survived without them:  Compact discs Microwave ovens The Internet Cable television Calculators Satellite anything Personal computers Cordless phones (let alone cell phones) Digital clocks And video tapes--scratch that--DVDs.  I can tell stories about buying my first pack of cigarettes for 75 cents and bitching about gas going to 65 cents a gallon.  This makes me feel old, really old. Gray hair, wrinkles, and aching joints didn't bother me as much.  Additionally, for as disgusting as it makes me feel, I'm surprised how often (and easily) I gravitate to this topic of conversation when around younger folk.  "Hey," I'll say. "Did you know that when I was a kid, we didn't have flourescent-colored fabrics?"  The addressed child will usually roll their eyes and respond, "So?"  "Well," I'll nervously reply. "Don't you think it is interesting that I made it all the way through junior high school without day-glo pink accessories?"  I don't bother to insist on an answer, for it is at this point that I realize my true position in this youth's eyes: old and uncool.  The same is true with most of my friend's kids. When they were seven--Eric was totally cool. Now that they are twelve--I might as well be the school principal.

      So, I feel like a real shit today. Yesterday I broke off my relationship with my book agent. It chews me up because I feel like I put myself in the position of chosing between a person and my book project--and I chose the book project. In many ways, it goes against every fiber of my being. In other ways, it feels like the only real choice I had.  As I've written here before, this burlesque book proposal has run hot and cold for quite some time--almost to the point of dropping it entirely. However, it seems like every few months, burlesque revival just gets bigger and bigger. Soon, someone else will think of doing the same thing I'm doing and beat me to the punch.  A few months ago another agent approached me about handling the book proposal. I initially wasn't interested. But as time has gone on, I've found myself caught between someone who I've had a long relationship with, but isn't selling this book--and someone who I don't know at all, but is chomping at the bit to sell this thing.  I've always tried to conduct all the relationships in my life with the same sense of respect and honesty. People talk about the line between "work" relationships and "personal" relationships--I completely fail at making a distinction. I try to treat everyone the same--how I'd like to be treated.  It's a huge risk. If I'm making a mistake, I have only myself to blame. If it does work out, I hope it is worth it.

      It has been a slow year on the book front*, but here is the list of titles (in order) that I've read so far in 2003:      urlLink  All My Life For Sale   by John D. Freyer   urlLink  The Sound and The Fury   by William Falkner   urlLink  Niagara Falls All Over Ag ain  by Elizabeth McCracken   urlLink  The New H.N.I.C.   by Todd Boyd   urlLink  What Liberal Media?   by Eric Alterman   urlLink  Legends of Long Beach Island   by David Siebold and Charles Adams III   urlLink  Stiff   by Mary Roach   urlLink  A Million Little Pieces   by James Frey   urlLink  Reefer Madness   by Eric Schlosser   *=In 2001 I read 40 books, in 2002 I read 28. At the rate I'm going, I'll read even less this year (too many things going on--plus I've really increased the number of magazines and newspapers that I regularly read).

      Every once in a while, I entertain my friends with photos from the news wires with slightly revised captions. Here is a bunch from today's news:      "Okay, will the inept and incompetent one please raise their hand."     Trying to avoid attention, legendary record producer Phil Spector disguises himself as the one person he's sure no one wants to talk to or be near: Michael Jackson.     "Think I wouldn't make a good President? Well, bring it on, bitch."     Trying to raise attendance at otherwise lackluster games, the WNBA tries out "Waltz with a closeted lesbian professional athlete" during half time.     "Easy lover, wait until we get back to the chalet!"

      Right after Christmas I bought myself a  urlLink PlayStation 2 . I had two concerns about this purchase: (a) if I'd play it at all, and (b) if I'd ever stop playing it.  While it seems odd that I'd purchase something, then worry about using it--I tend to burn out on things that frustrate or bore me. I feared that I'd play it for a few days, then stop using it because it was either too easy or too hard. My other concern was that I'd start using the thing and become a junkie. While I am amazed how quickly four hours can disappear when you are in front of a PlayStation loaded with  urlLink Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell , I have never pulled an all-nighter simply to get to the next level of Wolfenstein. In reality, I tend to cycle--I'll play a game for a few days, then never touch the thing for two weeks afterwards. So neither of my fears has played out.  The twist is the games I own. While I mostly rent games from Blockbuster, I have purchased four games. Of those, three are discs filled with old arcade and Atari 2600 games from the 70s and 80s--stuff like Kaboom, Pitfall, Asteroids, Galaxa, Pac Man, Ms Pac Man, Star Master, and Pole Position. While these games are played on the modern PlayStation, they play sound, and run just like it's 1982 and I'm pumping quarters into a sticky machine at the AMF Classic Lanes in Canton, Ohio.  While it might be easy to shrug this attraction off to nostalgia--I truly love playing these games. In fact, the only time my girlfriend has touched the PlayStation has been to challenge me to rounds of Dig Dug (at which I thoroughly kick ass, mind you). You might also think the attraction is that I already know how to play these games--I spent countless hours in front of the Atari or at arcade games as a kid and, therefore, should know how to play these games without much effort. While it is fun to play these games again--the truth is that playing Pitfall isn't all that easier than playing Grand Theft Auto. Sure, the modern game's graphics are better and more involved, but the pace of your advance through the game isn't all that different than games that are older than most college students. While Grand Theft Auto might challenge you to beat street-walking prostitutes into bloody pulps before the cops show up,  getting Harvey Pitfall past those alligators and over that log is no cakewalk.   The best part is the feeling that I am, somehow, getting away with something. Twenty years ago when my third spaceship was hit by an asteroid fragment, it was time to give up another quarter. Now when I'm pulverized, I just hit the start button-- free of charge . It feels similar to playing a slot machine and keeping the payouts, all without having to putting in any money. Awesome.  I saw  urlLink Greg Giraldo  do a riff on what it will be like for us to explain our videogames to our grandchildren. He imagined that we'd get all excited trying to explain why Pac Man became a national sensation--"You are a dot...chasing around other dots...and trying to eat them before they touch you." I can imagine we'd receive the same looks we gave our our grandparents when they'd talk about making dolls out of sticks, used handkerchiefs, and glue.  All that said, I still felt pretty damn pathetic when the PlayStation totally kicked my ass at Pong (yes,  that  Pong) (score: 15-1, 14-2, 15-1). My girlfriend came in part way through the last game and was beside herself with laughter. Her revelry ended a few minutes later when she threw down the controller and walked away after falling behind the machine half way through her first game.

      My parents own a "second home" on a small lake out in the heart of Ohio Amish country. It's a beautiful and idyllic place. But an event this past weekend has placed the lake at the center of my thoughts.  A young man drowned there Saturday evening.  He was a twenty-one year old college student who went out on a boat around midnight with eight friends. While out on the lake, they decided to throw out some ski tubes and have some fun. The young man couldn't swim and wasn't wearing a life jacket. After rounding a corner, his friends noticed that he wasn't on the tube anymore. They looked around in vain (of course, the boat had no lights on it) but couldn't find him.  The authorities closed off the lake and searched for two days with patrol boats and divers. They never found his body.  While I feel bad for the young man, his grieving family, and his guilt-ridden friends, I have to say there probably a bit of Darwinism at work. It was a stupid thing to do. The unfortunate outcome easily moved past the realm of "possible" into "probable."  Life at the lake is slowly getting back to normal. But, at least for now, there is a huge caveat. If you know anything about how bodies decompose, you know that it takes an incredible amount of effort to keep a body underwater (just ask Scott Peterson). As a body decomposes, it fills with gas, which just makes it progressively more buoyant. Eventually the body, or parts of the body, will come up to the surface. The "huge caveat" is that as people resume their fishing, boating, waterskiing, and admiration of the beautiful surroundings, there is always the possibility that a gory corpse is going to pop up at any moment.  I live in Kent, Ohio. I went to college in Kent. I grew up in Canton, Ohio--about 45 minutes from here. In short, while I travel frequently and live a pretty extraordinary life (especially by Ohio standards), I've spent most of my life living within a three-hour radius of where I was born. As a result, I see a lot of people who have a lot of history with me. I pass them on the street, see them in the grocery store, and even socialize with some of them.  I also see a lot of drowning. I see people who are drowning in debt, drowning in relationships, drowning in drugs or alcohol, drowning from the weight of their own dreams--lots of things are holding them down. The sad part is that, unlike our twenty-one year old tuber, they don't die. They remain walking wounded.   For example, I have one friend who used to be my roommate after college. He was funny, clever, and really had a lot going for him. Now he has a wife and kid, a big money job, and just bought a huge house that's way too big for him because his family had "outgrown" the last huge McMansion they owned.  This friend is also painfully miserable.  If you ask him why he has the job (that he hates), he'll tell you it's so that he can pay for his big house. If you ask why he has the big house, he'll tell you it makes his family happy. If you ask why his family is otherwise unhappy, he'll tell you its because he doesn't spend enough time with them. If you ask why he doesn't spend enough time with them, he'll say its is because his job demands so much of his time (though the truth is he can't stand his wife, but she is the mother of his child whom he loves, but he can't relate to the son because they never spend time together). It is this kind of sick, cyclical shit that is slowly eating his soul. And the worse part is that he has no idea how far he has descended. He'll just bitch about his wife, his job, and his big ass house.  He's drowning and doesn't even know it.  And as I said, the drowning happens for lots of different reasons--it isn't just some anti-capitalism-rant-against-materialism thing. I know plenty of people who are equally miserable for lots of other reasons. That's because the main thing that causes them to slowly die is themselves, not their possessions, families, or vocations. They were killed by their own choices in life (or, more specifically, lack thereof)--their own unwillingness to take risks.  Most of my good friends have moved away--scattered all over the country trying to find a life that they couldn't find here. They have the luxury of never seeing this. They all have friends who've been caught up in dysfunction and never moved on, but they don't have to deal with them, except when their "old friends" come to visit and crash in their guest rooms. They stomach a weekend of their small friends and their small lives, and gladly wave as their "old friends" drive down the road back to wherever they came from (and full of tales of the big city).  Me, I should leave too, but I've never felt the need. My world is in my head--the things I write, the things I think, the way I process the things I see. I plot and plan, venture out into the world to make my surgical strikes, then come back home. This doesn't make sense to a lot of my departed friends who wonder how someone like  me  (read: just like them) could ever be happy in a place like  this  (read: the same shithole they ran away from). Location isn't all that important to me. However, when I see some of my friends slowly fall apart, I really wish I was somewhere else. Perhaps this is all pennyante bullshit. An excuse.  Perhaps I, too, am drowning--and am just as clueless as everyone else.

       New on the bookshelf:   urlLink  Invisible Frontier: Exploring the Tunnels, Ruins, and Rooftops of Hidden New York   by L.B. Deyo & David "Lefty" Leibowitz. A fun read, though you expect that "urban adventuring" would be a bit more wild and fun. Still worth a rainy afternoon.

      I've been trying for two days to get through to the new "legit" music download site for Windows users  urlLink Buymusic.com . Unfortunately, the site has been so busy I haven't been able to get through.  Imagine that?!? According to the music industry, their customers are just a bunch of thieves and unethical miscreants who were content to steal music rather than purchase it legitimately.  On a related note: If you are a file trader, the  urlLink EFF  has created  urlLink a site to check if you are "on the list" to be sued by the RIAA . For decades the music industry has been content to screw artists--now they are "coming out of the closest" about their willingness to screw their own customers. The truth is that I have never bought more CDs than since the evolution of file sharing. I have discovered more music--and therefore purchased more music--than at any other period in my life.  Fuck the music industry. There is a special place in Hell reserved for those spineless, unethical, manipulative leeches.

      This is a big summer for friends' projects. As I mentioned, both David Giffels and Chuck Klosterman have books coming out this month. Also, my friend and WKSU commentator Harvey Pekar has a movie coming out about his life and comic book series  American Splendor . The movie has a  urlLink great web site --worth a visit.  Al these books and movies are very exciting--it's about all I talk about lately.

      I am amazed by my new found self-restraint.  The  urlLink new Jane's Addiction album  was released on Tuesday and I have managed to avoid purchasing it.   This is a big deal because I know it will be a huge disappointment. Don't ask why I know this, I have just seen too many once-great bands reunite to put out pathetic records. Perhaps my pessimism is based on the members' post-Jane's output, perhaps it is because they are all currently drug free, or maybe it is a result of reading/hearing any interview with Perry Farrell over the last decade. That record will more than likely suck, and suck hard. There is a chance that it might be interesting, but let's face it--the odds are against them.  Usually I would purchase these records out of some weird sense of loyalty to how good they used to be, even though I know I'll hate it. However, I think I'm getting over that. I think what helped make that happen was the  urlLink last Liz Phair record --which sucked and blew at the same time. It was so awful that I hadn't even listened to it all the way through before I listed it for resale on Amazon.*  So, it has been two days--and I am still  Strays  free. We'll see how long it lasts.   *=Within an hour some sucker bought it from me used for $1 less than I paid for it.

      I am a support of the ACLU. I am very proud of their work on protecting civil liberties. However, I am not proud of their efforts to sell my name and address to every political cause in the planet.  Talk about playing to type...there is an implicit assumption here that if I support the ACLU that I'll also want to support any lefty-liberal, Birkenstock, hairy armpit cause trying to protect the environment, fight for women's rights, feed the hungry, save animals, and on and on.  It's like clockwork, within two weeks of sending a check to the ACLU, the envelopes start to arrive. They describe atrocities throughout the world and promise that my $25 check (payable to them) will make the world just a little bit brighter. Seeing these solicitations and the troubles they describe--it's depressing. It's not that I want to live a life of ignorance, but when I reach in the mailbox there are already plenty of bills and junk mail to upset me, let alone an envelope that says "Eric Nuzum, do you want the world's children to go to bed hungry?" Give me a break.  The only grace to this is that I know that the ACLU gets a few cents every time they "rent" me to other organization. If there was any other group I'd support--it would be the "Save a Tree By Ending Direct Mail" foundation.

      I wasn't baptized until I was four years old. It was a deliberate decision by my mother.  According to Dante, that was a pretty risky move. Had I died before baptism, I would have spent eternity in Limbo-the land of sorrow without torment. It's an ideal many Christians share: the only way into heaven is to be washed clean through baptism. No baptism and you are confined to the borders of grief's abysmal valley. It doesn't matter how many good deeds you have performed-no ticket, no laundry. The best you can hope for is Limbo, the foyer of eternal damnation. One finger in an electric socket and I would have faced perpetuity in a seven-walled castle with Socrates, Gandhi, and a gaggle of SIDS children.  When I asked my mother why she decided to wait until I was four, she told me that it was in order to let me make my own decision, speak for myself, and participate in the ceremony. While I do remember the baptism (I think), I can't imagine how I could've understood what I was doing. At four years old I still adamantly believed in the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny-the existence of God wasn't something I'd spent too much time contemplating.  We weren't Catholic, but Episcopal. However, regarding baptism, there wasn't a hell of a lot of difference (excuse the pun). After everyone shows up and proclaims the greatness of God, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, the baptism candidate is introduced, and the Q and A begins.   Celebrant:  Do you renounce Satan and all spiritual forces of wickedness that rebel against God?  Answer:  I renounce them.  Celebrant:  Do you renounce the evil powers of this world which corrupt and destroy the creatures of God?  Answer:  I renounce them.  Celebrant:  Do you renounce sinful desires that draw you from the love of God?  Answer:  I renounce them.  Celebrant:  Do you turn to Jesus Christ and accept him as your Savior?  Answer:  I do.  Celebrant:  Do you put your whole trust in his grace and love?  Answer:  I do.  Celebrant:  Do you promise to follow and obey him as your Lord?  Answer:  I do.  Some other formalities follow, including the pouring of water over the candidates head (that's the part I remember-I cried), and then the priest proclaims: "Eric, you are sealed by the Holy Spirit and marked as Christ's own for ever. Amen."  If my mother really wanted to make me a part of the process, she probably should have waited until now-though I'm very thankful she didn't. Mine would have been the only four-hour baptism on record. It would have taken me a good hour just to get past the first three "renounce" questions ("How exactly do you define 'evil powers,' Reverend?"), let alone a full treatment (and resulting negotiations) of the three final promise questions ("So let's say that aliens land on Earth and convince everyone that they are God-does that still count as "obeying" even though I was worshiping a false deity? What about if I hear a loud noise while praying and flinch, does that count against this 'whole trust' business?"). I'm also thankful because those are very important and powerful questions, and I wonder what my honest answers would be.  Like many people, I spend a lot of time wondering where I come from and where I'll go after I die. Most just hedge their bets and put in a half-assed effort at attending church. Not me. If those words are going to come out of my mouth, I want to mean it. Being marked as Christ's own forever is some heavy shit. I don't take that kind of committment lightly.

      My buddy Chuck Klosterman's second book   urlLink Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs   is finally out. It is awesome and quite funny. Chuck's book is one of two coming out this summer written by friends (the other is David Giffels's   urlLink We Are Devo!  ).  Chuck's book even contains some references to yours truly. He included several of our discussions in a chapter about people he knows who've known serial killers (surprisingly, Chuck knows three people--including me--who fall into that category). In that chapter, Chuck describes me as "one of those hyperkinetic NPR liberals who spends his free time rescuing kittens from the pound."*  When Chuck first sent me a copy of the chapter in draft form, I read it, then got very busy and never wrote Chuck about it. A few weeks later I emailed him about something completely different, and he responded with e-sighs of relief. He thought I was pissed off by how I was portrayed in the book and didn't write him because I was so mad.  Not true, I have pretty thick skin. The section is actually quite a funny (and accurate) take on me.   *=the funniest part of that is that it is true, my cat was rescued by me as a kitten. Otherwise, I would never own a cat.

      I played in my first rock and roll band when I was eleven. The band: KISS Junior.  The band consisted of my friend Terry on guitar and vocals, his sister Tammy (who I had a terrible crush on) played tambourine, and I played electric organ.  Unfortunately, none of us were very gifted at our craft. I had started piano lessons a year earlier. I played a mean Fur Elise--but that was also the extent of my recognizable repetoire. I had inherited the organ from my dead grandmother and--seeing it was more portable than the family baby grand--took it back and forth to band practice. It had a half-size keyboard and one four-inch speaker mounted inside the cabinet.  Terry had no idea how to play guitar; he didn't even know how to tune it. He had received a cheap guitar and amp combo for Christmas. After noodling with it for about half an hour he'd figured out how to make it feedback. That was where his guitar self-instruction ended. Further, Terry was completely tone deaf and even his feedback was arrhythmic. His playing and singing amounted to screaming lyrics and beating his guitar  quickly  during fast passages, screaming lyrics and beating his guitar  slowly  during softer moments.  Tammy matched her brother's sense of timing. She had agreed to be our tambourine player because Terry thought it would be good to have a girl in the band and I took any excuse to spend time in her presence.  Our repertoire consisted entirely of KISS songs. Specifically, KISS songs from the three KISS records we owned:  Rock And Roll All Over ,  Destroyer , and  Alive II . This complicated matters, because no KISS songs contained arrangements for electric organ, tambourine, and untuned guitar. However, despite our limits and handicaps, we wanted to rock.  We'd gather in Terry and Tammy's basement in front of an old bed sheet that Terry had decorated with a slightly revisioned KISS logo. We'd play our KISS records on an old wooden Hi-Fi that ran the length of one entire wall. It--like my organ--had been inherited by Terry from a departed relative. The Hi-Fi, like its current owner, had one volume. Because of forty years of grit and dust settling into the volume knob, it went straight from "almost audible" to "deafening" with the slightest rotation.  Terry would put one of the KISS records on the turntable, drop down the needle, and we'd flail away. We did this almost every afternoon for the entire summer. To us, KISS Junior was pure joy.  We only performed once--at Tammy's birthday party. Tammy had about six girls from school over for cake, presents, screaming, and giggling. Terry and I hung out in the backyard with a few friends, banned from the house, pretending not to care, yet desperate to know what was going on inside.  At one point we were allowed in to get some leftover pizza and Terry saw an opportunity to impress the assembled gaggle.  "You know, we have a rock band," Terry offered. "And Tammy is in it."  They stared at Terry, and once the stun of the broken silence between boys and girls had worn off--they started staring at Tammy.  "You totally have to play for us," one girl suggested.  Bait taken.  Tammy wanted nothing to do with it and tried to talk us and her friends out of it. Before she had a chance, Terry was corralling everyone into the basement and ordering me to set up our equipment.  Once everyone was in place I was stricken with absolute terror. I mentally listed off everything that was wrong about playing in front of anyone, let alone a group of girls and my neighborhood friends. Before I knew what was happening, Terry dropped the needle down during the crowd roar before the live version of "Strutter" and we were off.  KISS launched into "Strutter," Terry started screaming and banging his guitar, I hit tiny organ keys, and Tammy just stood there. Our assembled audience seemd somewhat frozen, occasionally wincing at the noise and wondering what they were supposed to make of this. After a minute or so, someone started to giggle, then a few others started laughing.  Tammy threw down her tambourine and ran upstairs crying. I stood there unsure if I was supposed to go comfort one band mate or stay and perform with the other. I stayed. The show had to go on--and it did. Terry had no intention of stopping. After each song, he'd make his guitar feed back, throw his hands in the air, repeatedly yell "Thank you" to the nine assembled children, and then get ready for the next song. No one applauded. No one did anything.  One by one, the kids would quietly leave the basement and head upstairs. By the end of the album side, it was just Terry and I, plus the slightly retarded kid from next door. He wasn't part of the party or our group of friends. He had just heard the noise and came in the house and down the steps. He did applaud, enthusiastically.  Terry and I were not deterred, we were Hell-bent on rocking 34th Street, ferociously.  Terry came up with what I thought was a brilliant idea. We played KISS music, but we lacked any costumes or make-up. We figured make-up would be a lot easier than finding seven-inch leather boots with skulls on them (especially in a size six), but our mothers expressly forbid us from trying it out. My mother was convinced we'd get a staff infection; Terry's mother was convinced we'd burn down the house (her standard excuse for everything). One evening we found ourselves alone at Terry's house while the rest of his family had gone out to a movie. We thought we'd take the occasion to buy some cheap Halloween theatrical make-up, recently put on display at the five-n-dime a few blocks away, and try out some KISS-inspired designs.  We were about half way finished with our make-up when we heard his family pull in the driveway. We panicked. Terry started to run water in the bathtub and told me to start scrubbing my face. Of course, the cheap grease paint wasn't going anywhere and our efforts to clean it off just resulted in spreading it further over our faces.  Eventually, we were discovered.  "What are you two doing in there?" Terry's mother asked.  "We're taking a bath," Terry quickly offered.  "Together?" she asked.  "Yeah, we're almost finished," Terry said, hoping that it would placate his mother long enough to clean off the make-up.  As soon as we stepped out of the bathroom, Terry's parents called us downstairs. We sat nonchalantly on the couch, with a look of confused-yet-polite-wonder on our faces, as if we worried what possibly could be of concern.  "What were you doing take a bath together," Terry's mother asked.  "When no one else is home," his father added.  In the middle of Terry's rambling answer, Terry's father looked at me and squinted.  "What's that around your eyes?" he asked.  I paused for a moment, then answered: "Make-up."  Terry placed his head in his hands and sighed.  I could see Terry's father starting to boil.  "Are you guys gay?" he asked, containing his obvious anger yet still trying to maintain an air of sincere concern.  Terry jumped in the air and pretended to be offended. How could they assume we were putting on  girl's  make-up? How could they assume that we'd do something bad when they were away? What would ever lead them to believe that just because two guys took a bath together and had make-up stains around their eyes--that they were gay?  I don't remember how the rest of the conversation went, but I do remember it didn't go well. I was sent home and Terry was grounded for being so mouthy to his parents.  The incident drove a permanent wedge in KISS Junior--the band broke up. Later on, I'd play in dozens of bands during high school, college, and beyond--always trying to recapture the feeling of being in that basement, banging on an electric organ, and shouting the lyrics to "Love Gun." I never did and probably never will.

      From my seven year old nephew, who is visiting uncle Eric this week:  Him: "You know, I don't need to be a rich man. But if I was, you know what I'd do with my money?"  Response: "What's that?"  Him: "I'd spend my money on the poor, health care, swords, and outdoor survival skills."

      A friend of mine is writing a cover story for Esquire on Britney Spears and, earlier this week, conducted his interview with her. He wrote me afterwards to describe the experience. To quote him:  "Britney is either (a.) the least sincere, most fabricated artist I've ever interviewed, or (b.) the single stupidest human I have ever met."  The root of this assessment is Britney's insistance (not the first time she's said this type of thing) that her popularity has nothing to do with her sexuality or mega-celebrity, instead attributing it to "hard work," "loving music," and "prayer." While I'm surprised that most people expect her to have any deeper meaning to her work, I have always been willing to believe that there was.  Just as easily as she could be a controlling, media-saavy next-generation Madonna, she also could be an average 21-year-old girl who sighs whenever she sees a puppy and honestly wishes for world peace. In that case, the only people responsibile for any deeper meaning are us--the people who cannot deny an interest in her.  Perhaps this is where most people's jealousy of her looks, fame, and wealth come in--thinking that if she has more of any attribute than they do, she must be completely underserving of that grace.  When I responded to my friend, I guessed that Britney is probably a little bit of each--denial can be as ignorant as bliss. If there is anything to envy about Brittany, it's that she has the position and power to create her own sizeable helpings of each.

      Big day today...  I checked on my retirement account today and for the first time since I started investing in it three years ago...my investments are worth more than the cash I invested. I'm ahead a whopping $9.45.  I don't plan on retiring for another 30 years, so I can tolerate a couple highs and lows, but damn, what a bummer to watch things start off on such a bad, extended note. Of course, I started investing right as the stock market was bottomed out, so I shouldn't have been surprised that my "reward of investment" was the feeling that I was throwing water into a leaky bucket.  When I was attending investment seminars, they'd show graphs illustrating the beauty of compound interest and how quickly money can grow over the course of many years. Only rarely did they mention risk. Nothing they said prepared me to spend three years watching a third of my money disappear.   Now that I'm in the black (okay, by .00196%), I'm feeling quite Rockefeller. Can't touch this!

I owned these albums on vinyl and they are beat to hell. These Van Halen albums were some of the first records that I would play over and over again. I mastered air guitar pantomiming to these albums. I purchased used copies of the CD re-masters and they just arrived at the end of last week. They're as wonderful as I remember.

       This is the final installment of a four part entry. Since this blog is listed in reverse chronological order, you need to scroll down to the July 2nd through July 4th entries if you haven't read the earlier segments.   After sending the drunk sound crew off to work, I did the same. I spent the afternoon trying to not obsess about them. I promised myself that I wouldn't go down there until six o'clock.   As soon as six o'clock hit, I made my way down to the memorial grounds. As I drove up, I could see that there was, indeed, two stacks of speakers on either end of the monument. As I walked closer, I noticed a problem.  Mike and company had set up the speakers on top of one level of scaffolding about five feet off the ground. The scaffolding was not weighed or tied down and all the speakers were stacked up on the front side of the scaffolding, which happened to be facing down hill. I walked up to the scaffolding and placed my hand on it. As I expected, the huge stack of speakers swayed back and forth. If they stayed this way and someone bumped into or leaned against the scaffolding, the speakers would topple over, crushing the leaner and everyone within fifteen feet behind him.  I found Mike and called him over.  "All set up, just as you wanted," he said.  "Mike, the minute someone touches those speakers they are going to all fall over."  "Well, what are we supposed to do," he replied. "No one told us we'd be setting up on the grass."  "If you had bothered to check this out when you got here you could have poured a cement foundation and let it set in the time you guys have been fucking around. People are going to start gathering for the fireworks in an hour or so," I said. "Get them weighed down and secure by then."  As I was walking back to my truck, I noticed that there was a massive pile of puke next to the visitors center sign--which was roughly half way between the sound system and the bathrooms.  I came back around 8:30 and things seemed to be under control. I gave Mike a CD of patriotic band music and told him to start playing it when the first firework exploded. It didn't seem like a difficult task, but considering the last two days, I decided to go through the instructions one more time.  "Hey, you look like you could use a drink." It was my boss, the guy who got me into this in the first place.  "I think you're right."  "Listen, come up the reception with me. You've worked hard, you can get a bite to eat and watch the fireworks from up there," he offered.  The Perry Peace Monument at Put-in-Bay is a 330 foot column with a huge light and observation deck on top. The view was incredible. To help pay for the fireworks, the Chamber was charging $300 a head to attend a posh reception up top. Given a chance to get 330 feet away from this mess and the holiday crowd, I quickly accepted.  Once I was fed and calmed down, I walked to the south side of the observation deck to watch the fireworks. I could see the barge in the harbor and knew they were about to ignite the first batch. As soon as I saw the first firework take off, I looked over at the sound system.  Nothing.  I waited for the next round to go up.  Still nothing.  I ran towards the elevator and headed down to the ground level.  As the elevator opened, I saw them faces of several thousand people, all lit with multiple colors and intensities of reflected light. They were all smiling. The 1812 overture was booming everywhere. It sounded great.  I walked over to Mike and asked him how it was going.  "Perfect man, things happened right on cue."  "But I couldn't hear it up there," I said, pointing to the observation deck.  "Of course not," he replied. "With this wind, the sound isn't really going to travel very far up--just out towards the crowd."  It sounded reasonable--probably the first such utterance since he arrived.  "Hey, a couple of my friends are stuck over here for the night...alright if we crash at your place? Otherwise, they're going to have to get a campsite...and it might rain."  I just smiled and headed back to the elevator.  Once I got up top, I headed towards the edge of the deck. The fireworks were exploding right at our eye level. It was one of the most awesome things I had ever seen. For the rest of my life, every time I see fireworks, I'll remember that night.  Afterward I went back to the back to help close up and headed home. No one was there so I shut off the lights, locked the door, and went to bed.  About two hours later I heard a pounding at the door--I peaked out my bedroom window and saw Mike, his crew, and about five others assembled outside my door.  I thought about what to do for a minute, then quietly laid back down on the bed and fell asleep.

       This is the third installment of a four part entry. Since this blog is listed in reverse chronological order, you need to scroll down to the July 2nd and 3rd entries if you haven't read the earlier segments.    Okay, so here I am, standing in front of Mike (who is naked) and his girlfriend (who, unfortunately, is also naked--and not supposed to be there), having sex at 2:00 in the morning on my couch while blaring Pink Floyd's  Dark Side of the Moon .  Just as I'm about to go ballistic, I notice some motion out of the corner of my eye. There are two guys sitting at my kitchen table playing quarters. They are so drunk that I think they honestly had no idea that I was there, let alone that two people were having sex on a couch, with the lights on, twenty feet away from them.  I struggled with how to handle this. In the interest of not letting this situation grow out of control I had let about six too many incidents go by without doing anything, and as a result the situation had, indeed, grown out of control.  I opted to pretend like nothing was wrong.  "Hi Mike," I said. "How's it going?"  "Ah, okay," he said, still frozen still.  His girlfriend stood on her hands and knees, head down, staying frozen in position as well. The two dudes at the kitchen table finally were catching on to what is going on.  "Did your girlfriend catch the ferry?" I asked.  She shot her head up and gave me a look that indicated she would kill me if she could get out from under Mike.  "Oh, hey there," I said. "What are you doing here?"  "Ah...she missed the boat," Mike replied, trying to reach for his clothes without withdrawing from his pissed off partner.  "I'm going to set the alarm for 6:00 am--that's about four hours from now," I said, sitting down with the two quarter players. "I bet you guys want to get an early start--seeing that you really haven't gotten anything done yet."  "Sure," Mike said, throwing his shirt across his girlfriend's back. "That would be cool."  One of the quarter players finally connected the dots on the situation.  "Dude," he yelled. "You are totally fucking her, man!"  "Well, he was," I replied. "Now he seems to have suddenly developed a little performance anxiety."  Mike grabbed a blanket off the couch, covering he and his girlfriend. They then proceeded to get dressed underneath the cover.  The next morning I got up, as promised, at six. I made some coffee for my guests and decided to play Pink Floyd again to wake them up. They managed to get up, exchange some pleasantries, drink some coffee, and head out to the site. I went back to bed.  When I woke up, I headed down to the monument grounds to check on their progress. Nothing was set up and there was no sign of the crew or their truck. I went down to Frosty's to see if theye were there and found a phone message, marked urgent, to call the manager at the Roundhouse Bar.  "I just wanted to make sure that it is okay to extend your guys' tab through today," the manager asked.  "What guys and what tab," I replied.  "Those sound guys I saw you with yesterday...their comp tab from last night...they want to open it today for Bloody Marys."  "I'll be right over."  I found the crew, already drunk, sitting at the Roundhouse. It seems they called over to Frosty's the night before to get an okay to purchase dinner at the Roundhouse and one of my bartenders, knowing they were okay to comp food, figured it was okay. Their bill included $32 worth of rotissiere chicken, and $275 of beer and shots.  "Eric, buddy," Mike said. "Just take it out of our check--no problem."  "Listen up 'buddy'," I yelled. "At this point, there is no check. It is noon--you have been here two days, the fireworks start in ten hours, and you haven't done a fucking thing. That sound system had better be set up and tested before six o'clock, or you can forget about getting paid."  The contract specified that I had to give them a check after they cleaned up late that night. I figured that I might be able to turn things around by threatening to not pay them. At this point, if they left, so be it.  Despite their condition, they managed to gather themselves together, stumble into their truck, and head to the monument. They had six hours to get it together.   Coming tomorrow:   The grand conclusion .

       This is the second part of a four part entry. Since this blog is listed in reverse chronological order, you need to scroll down to the July 2nd entry if you haven't read the first segment.   So it's July 2nd, 1991, the day the sound company crew was to arrive. I was working in Frosty Bar and told them to meet me there when they arrived. About 2:00 in the afternoon, one of the maintenance guys told me there were a few people standing in the bar asking for me.  Now, as I mentioned earlier, I wasn't too excited to be in charge of this fireworks music stuff, and hadn't really thought through the entire process. There were two things that should have struck me as odd about the whole thing: first, the contract specified that the crew would need to arrive two days before the fireworks. Now, when even the largest rock groups tour the country, it isn't unusual for the crew and equipment to arrive in the morning, spend the day setting up and testing, do the concert that night, then tear everything down and leave that same night. The entire process, from arrival to departure, can be as short as twelve hours. All this sound crew needed to do was set up a few stacks of speakers (taken, they were enough speakers to provide sound to a space the size of about three football fields--but it still wasn't that complicated) and all the music was coming off a CD (which I was providing). I never stopped to think why they'd have to be there so far in advance, and I should have. Further, they said that they needed to have a crew of four people. While I thought that was a bit extreme--it was mildly defendable.  Secondly, the contract specified that I'd need to provide them with accommodations and food during their stay. Again, not a huge deal--but I should have thought this through more than I did.  Well, I walk over into the bar--and there was the crew of four--plus all their girlfriends--plus one or two other guys. The head of the crew, Mike (not his real name), came up and introduced himself.  "Sure are glad we are able to help you out with this event," Mike said.  "Good, I'm glad we're able to do this," I replied, lying. "Would you like to go over to the monument grounds to take a look at the site?"  "No, we can go later...we're pretty hungry now. Who do we talk to about some pizza and beer?" he replied.  I should have thought better of this, but it was the beginning of the holiday weekend and I was really busy. I said I'd take care of it, put in an order for a few pizzas, and had the bartender bring over a round of beer. Then, I got back to work.  A few hours later, I noticed that the collected crew and their pose where still sitting at the front table, now covered with empty pizza plates, tomato sauce, plastic forks, and about five dozen beer bottles. As I walked behind the bar, one of them came up and asked for four beers.  "That will be $11.50," I replied. The crew member stared at me and laughed. He picked up the beers and walked back to the table.  "Aren't you taking care of their bill?" one of the bartender's asked.  No, I wasn't. I had promised pizza and a few beers. But that wasn't what they told the bartender. They had told him that I was paying for everything: the pizza, that first round of drinks, and the $165 worth of beer they drank after that. I walked over to discuss the matter with Mike.  "Hey man, you never said we could only have one beer," Mike reasoned. "We had an understanding. If you aren't going to live up to the terms of the contract, we'd better head home right now."  The point was obvious: Mike and his crew--and their crew--were here for two days of fun. If I didn't underwrite that fun, they'd leave and I'd be stuck explaining why the heavily advertised and ballyhooed musical fireworks would be unscored.  "Okay," I offered. "I'll take care of this one. But from here on out, I will pay for your meals only--and no alcohol."  Mike didn't like the terms, but didn't want to press his luck so early and agreed. Then they asked me to show them to their hotel.  "You'll be staying in the employee dorms," I said.  "Dorms? You are kidding," Mike replied.  "No, I'm not. The dorms are brand new--they are fine."  "We were supposed to get hotel rooms, it's in the contract."  "No, the contract says accommodations and the dorm is your accommodation."  "Okay, we'll gather everyone up and head over."  "Wait a minute...everyone?"  "Is there a problem?"  "Yes, there is a problem. You said a crew of four guys--that's two dorm rooms."  "You mean we have to share? We came here expecting to have our own rooms."  "Mike, there are 10 of you."  "Well, we thought our friends could crash in our rooms."  "You have two rooms--the friends aren't part of the deal."  "It's okay, they brought sleeping bags."  "Mike, the dorms are a secure building for employees. I had to pull strings to get you in there--there is no way they'll let five people stay in each room. No deal."  "Then what are our friends supposed to do?"  "That isn't my problem, Mike. Send them home. Get them a camp site...not my problem."  The rest of the crew were pissed off. Some threatened to leave, but Mike was honestly trying to settle them down.  After things were cleared out--the friends went to sit in the park while I took Mike and the crew over to the dorm building. I got them their keys, showed them how to get inside, and headed back to work.  An hour later I got a phone call from the dorm manager.  "I threw out your friends, they'll have to find somewhere else to stay," he said.  It turns out that my "friends" on the sound crew had waited all of ten minutes before trying to sneak all their friends into the dorm. Further, a few of them had been trying (unsuccessfully) to pick up on some of the dorm residents; one guy was walking through the dorm pinching girls' asses. When confronted by the dorm manager, they didn't want to leave, insisting that I had said it was okay to bring in their friends and make themselves at home. I had anticipated them trying to sneak someone in, and had warned the dorm manager not to believe them. When the dorm manager confronted them, one of the crew puked on a chair and another called the dorm manager's wife a "saggy titted, wrinkled bitch".  I went over to the dorm and tried to smooth things out. The dorm wasn't no longer an option--no negotiating would correct that situation. So I made a few phone calls and set up some alternatives.  "Okay, Mike, here's the deal. Friends have to go...all of them, girlfriends included. You and one other guy can sleeping bag it in my living room, the other two are going over to a friend's house for the same. No discussion. Take it or leave it."  "I guess we'll take it," Mike replied, shrugging his shoulders as if to indicate he felt like he was being forced into a bad deal.  All seemed like it was settling down. The friends gathered their things and started discussing the ferry schedule back to the mainland, I showed Mike and another guy where my house was, then went back to work.  The rest of the evening proceeded without incident. At 2:00 am, I headed home, beat tired and smelling like sweat, smoke, and stale beer. I just wanted to go home, take a shower, and get ready for the biggest day of the weekend, the 4th itself.  As I started walking towards my house, I could hear music. Not loud music, but just music playing. I figured that Mike and his crew guy had found the stereo and were just listening to music. A little imposing, but no big deal. As I got closer, I could even tell what it was, Pink Floyd's  Dark Side of The Moon .  I came home, opened the door, walked inside, and heard a scream.  It was Mike's girlfriend.  The two of them were butt naked, having sex doggy-style on my couch.   Coming tomorrow:   the big day.

      About this time of year, I start remembering one of the most dreadful experiences of my life...July 4th, 1991.  I was working as a bartender at Put-in-Bay, Ohio, and thought I'd be a good citizen by volunteering to help put together the annual fireworks presentation on the 4th of July.  Put-in-Bay (as I have probably explained before) is an island located in Lake Erie. Its primary industry is summer tourism. Unlike many such places, Put-in-Bay's bars, restaurants, and shops have little corporate involvement. A small number of families own and control just about all the major money making businesses. As you can imagine, these owners carry a tremendous amount of weight when it comes to civic events--especially those that might drum up extra business.  The 4th of July is  huge  on Put-in-Bay, so interest in the fireworks is high. One of the business owners insisted that there be music at that year's celebration. Since I was the only person on the committee that knew anything about music, PA systems, or anything related--I was placed in charge of this edict. To make it worse, the owner that made this pronouncement was the gentleman I worked for--so there was no getting out/ignoring/blowing off his suggestion.  Since Put-in-Bay is an island, and many of its visitors come via boat, the usual m.o. is to have the fireworks originate from a barge in the harbor (so that people on the island and in the bay can see it well). Since this wouldn't change, the "sound system" concept was almost immediately ruled out. However, most of the land-based observers gather on a large lawn at the Perry Peace Monument. Someone got the bright idea to rent a concert-sized sound system to put on that lawn--playing patriotic band music like "Stars and Stripes Forever" and the 1812 Overture--you get the point.  The Chamber of Commerce signed off on the idea and I was told to go forth and hire a company to provide the music.  Initially, the process didn't seem all that bad. After about a dozen phone calls I had secured three reasonable bids and presented them to the chamber board--saying that any of them would be suitable for what they wanted. They picked the cheapest (of course) and told me to make it happen. Contracts were signed, deposits secured, logistics put in place, and schedules set. Everything seemed pretty manageable.  Somewhere in that contract was a sentence that said we were responsible for putting up the crew during their stay, feeding them, and taking care of their transportation. I don't remember thinking too much about that item, I didn't think it would be much of a big deal. On July 2nd I'd realize how mistaken I was. That day was the beginning of one of the most miserable weekends of my life.   Coming tomorrow:   The crew arrives.

      As many of my readers know, I am a huge fan of pancakes. In fact, I love discussing pancakes and what makes one better than the other--the essential considerations when adding ingredients to the pancake or on top of the pancake, etc. At my girlfriend's suggestion, I'm going to create a segment of this website to document my love for the pancake and my cross-country sampling of different flapjacks. It will be set up like a blog with entries and a star rating system (using tiny pancakes) to rate things like flavor, syrup/topping, fluffiness, and so on.  One of the things that has slowed this down has been coming up with a good name for the site. I've come up with a number of really abd examples, such as "Eric's flap about jacks"--and it gets worse from there (if you have any suggestions, feel free to  urlLink write me ). My current title (until, and if, I come up with a better one), is "Eric's Fucking Pancake Blog."

      Loving the debut record from the  urlLink Polyphonic Spree --a 22-person band that sing inspirational songs without a hint of irony. It is amazing and fun--kind of like gospel music without the religion. They even wear long white robes.  Also, reading   urlLink Red Badge of Courage   by Stephen Crane. It's not bad for being 110 years old. The most amazing part is that Crane never had any first-person experience from which he could write the highly detailed battle scenes. He based all the battle action on newspaper stories he read.

      Recently there doesn't seem to many new releases to get excited about. As often happens during these times, I reach back onto the CD player and play the fuck out of some CDs I haven't listened to in some time.  Lately, I haven't been able to take Madonna's   urlLink Ray of Light   out of the CD player. The first five songs are brilliant (though it is, at times, hard to take Madonna's lyrics), the rest of the album is garbage.

One of the acts we caught was MiniKISS--a KISS cover band, complete with make-up and costumes. Oh, and by the way, they are all midgets.  See:        (By the way, the woman in the white dress is the emcee).

      I saw the movie   urlLink American Splendor   tonight.   I work with Harvey on his radio commentaries. When my station, WKSU, first decided to use local commentators--Harvey's was the first name I threw in the hat. I've been a huge fan of his since his days as a guest on David Letterman and have collected several of his comics and full-length books over the years. His radio work (assembled on a very cool  urlLink web page at WKSU --including an hour-long "best-of" special hosted and produced by me) is a combination of radio versions of his comics along with Harvey commenting on current events.  Even though I've been hearing Harvey talk about this movie since his first discussion with the producer three years ago, I was always skeptical about how Harvey and his material would translate to a movie. Further, I have yet to see a single review that doesn't praise it endlessly--seriously, I haven't read any criticism at all (this always makes me highly suspicious of anything). The movie's writers/directors/editors (a husband and wife team who did all the work themselves) totally "got" Harvey and created a beautiful movie that is funny and charming, but still true to Harvey's dark spirit.  It lives up to every accolate and praise that has been heaped upon it.  As an interesting side note--Harvey, who can barely operate a computer, has his  urlLink own web site  now. It is a blog in connection with the movie site. His wife helps him post his responses. Knowing Harvey's aversion to anything electronic or complicated--his having a web site is a source of endless humor for me.

      Received via email regarding a post earlier this week:     "The other Eric Nuzum is a worship leader In Kanasas City MISSOURI at the World Revival Church. I dont think he has been in Montana. He doesnt do traveling tent revivals. When the church and the revival relocated to K.C. from Smithton, Missouri, the first year was spent in a tent.  The tent is no longer there as we have built two more buldings on site.  World Revival Church  is a place for you to visit.....your other namesake is leaving us soon to be closer to his family in a Chicago suburb.  His work for the Lord is mounumental to the revival movement. Instead of drinking wine to the phase Jesus, try a little praise and prayer, I guarantee you will feel much better in the morning.

      There, I said it, this summer smokes pole.  Perhaps it was the dead body in my parents' lake, the week of non-stop thunderstorms that left six inches of water in my basement, or the massive power outage yesterday that has now left everyone here with no water at all. It's so hard to pick!  The worst part is that yesterday was my birthday--which is now marked. Next year, on my birthday, the news will be filled with "the first anniversary of  THE BIG BLACKOUT ." In 2008, my birthday will mark the fifth anniversary of  THE BIG BLACKOUT . You get the point. It would be similar to having September 11th as a birthday.  So yes, despite my attempts to enjoy myself, the summer has sucked. It has sucked out loud.

      I just switched ad servers on my  urlLink Banned Music web site  -- the previous ad provider was pushing a lot of online casinos, debt consolidation, and "hit the monkey and win a prize" ads. The Google Ads are a bit more to my liking--they are just text--no pop-ups, warnings, sleazy pitches, etc... I don't make a lot of money off these ads. In fact, they just about break even for all the costs associated with ericnuzum.com.  Google tries to target the ad content to the content of the site. The funniest thing is that the ad servers picked up on the following item on the page:    Marilyn Manson banned from Six Flags  Management of the Six Flags Amusement Park in Darien Lakes, New York, bans Marilyn Manson from performing at the park as part of the Ozzfest tour. No other acts are removed from the bill.   The "targeted" ads Google is offering? Six Flags tickets. I guess Google's servers don't have irony algorithms.

      You are being tracked.  You don't know it, but yes, you are being tracked. Nothing sleazy like DoubleClick or anything. If you scroll down to the bottom of this page, you'll see a graph that looks like this:       It isn't just a pretty ornament, it links to a traffic counting system. All it tells me is how many people visit this page and where they come from (watch that temper--this information is available from any web server and doesn't involve anything being put on your computer). In fact, almost every site you visit tracks this information.  So why am I writing about this?  Well, every once in a while I get curious about how people find this page, so I look up what are called "referral pages"--in essence, where you clicked to get here.  The funny thing is that I am surprised how many people enter "Eric Nuzum" into Google and/or Yahoo.  It is, by far, the most common way people get here.  Now, I know it isn't all for me--there are at least three other people named "Eric Nuzum" in the United States, and I know that they all have friends, relatives, and disgruntled co-workers in search of dirt on good old Eric. However, I can pretty much boil it down to me and the "other" Eric Nuzum.  Because of my oddly public life, I definitely come in first place. Go ahead and try it: here is "Eric Nuzum" at  urlLink Google , and at  urlLink Yahoo .  However, if you follow the links above, you'll notice something weird in the listings-- that  is the "other" Eric Nuzum.  This other Eric lives in Montana and is a Christian preacher and musical artist. He travels around preaching at tent revivals and has released several CDs of his music. I've never heard them (I've always wanted to), but I understand they are quite good and very popular (why am I oddly proud of that?).  Now, if you've read this blog--or any portion of this web site--you can certainly appreciate the humor in  me  sharing the same name as a fundamentalist preacher.  Every once in awhile, I get emails from people thinking I'm the "other" Eric. They ask when I'm preaching in their area or ask me to pray for them. I politely inform them they've got the wrong Eric.  I can also tell when someone who interviews me does all their research on the Internet, because they always ask why I lead this double life. I tell them that I'd rather have a double life than be a shitty journalist.  I think I even received an email from this "other" Eric once. Or at least the person said they were the other Eric. When I wrote back it bounced back immediately as being a bad address.  I have to admit, I'd really like to meet him some day. I'm sure we have little in common (outside of the most core component of our identity outside of DNA), but I think there might be some kind of weird bond.  Who knows, maybe some day.

        Following is a story I wrote last year, based on true events, that has never appeared anywhere. Posted here for your amusement.    When I turned my head away from the morning sun, I noticed a fresh pile of  poop six inches away from my head.  Even though I�d consumed two bottles of wine the evening before, I was pretty  sure it wasn�t there when I feel asleep.  We�d spent the evening playing �Around the Farm��a drinking game involving  the group consumption of all five varieties of Boone�s Farm wine whenever a  television character utters a pre-selected phrase. The only show worth using was  Gospel Jubilee on the Trinity Broadcast Network. Our trigger word was �Jesus�� which made for a short evening and the decision to spend the night on the living  room floor.  I awoke the next morning with a thick head, a misshapen couch cushion as a  pillow, and a generous helping of feces roughly half a foot from my nose.  It came from Fernando, my roommate�s cat.  We�d moved in three weeks earlier. It was our first house away from our parents.  Previously, I�d lived in the dormitories and was anxious to find a place off-campus to  get away from the restrictive visitor and alcohol tyranny of university housing.  Sharon asked Frank and me if we�d be interested in sharing a huge house she�d  rented two blocks from campus and we eagerly agreed.  Sharon hadn�t lived in the dorms, but commuted from home. She was the  youngest of five kids and the only one still living with her parents. Sharon�s father  attended all her brothers� football games and wrestling matches, helped them select  colleges, and took them on �guys only� weekend camping trips. He treated Sharon  more like a welfare case: someone to be tolerated until she became someone else�s  liability.  In his eyes, she couldn�t do anything right: couldn�t clean, do work in the yard,  and wasn�t smart enough to get good grades. Sharon had to beg for tuition to the  college closest to home. When the house became available, he refused to co-sign the  lease or help her with the deposit. Sharon was hell-bent to make it happen and  recruited us. She moved in early�the same day the previous tenants moved out.  Sharon decided that now she had a home of her own, she should have a pet as  well. Thus, Fernando. For their first two weeks together, Sharon and Fernando had a  pretty idyllic life: she spent her days waitressing at a local hippie coffee shop while  Fernando had the empty house to himself; at night they�d hang out together with  Sharon�s boyfriend, Bill, and bond. But everything changed with Frank and my  arrival.  We filled his play and hiding places with our stuff, played loud music at all hours,  and weren�t nearly as tolerant and understanding of his standard kitten behavior:  getting into things, knocking things over, and eating any food left accessible and  unguarded for more than a few seconds. Frank responded to everything the cat did  by yelling at Sharon. It was a byproduct of his quick temper. Oftentimes, Frank  seemed quick to debate simply to engage in an argument. Whether he was right or  not seemed secondary�beating his opponent was his reward.  I met Frank during an �Introduction to Experimental Film� class last year. Our  instructor often introduced each film with little warnings like, �This one isn�t what I�d  call a �popcorn film,�� �This piece isn�t for the squeamish,� or �You�d better not stick  around for this one if you�re epileptic.�  Occasionally we were treated to a movie with a plot and characters, but more  often we sat through several hours of apparently random collections of images and  color. When humans did appear in the films, they were usually chasing each other  through an old church or graveyard, silently sitting around a table eating chocolate  pudding, or crying in front of a mirror while brushing their hair. The films were  usually sound tracked with random screams, the sound of wind, or noise of a  sledgehammer striking the side of a grand piano. One morning we viewed a one- hour silent film featuring a series of hand-colored still images of a man�s penis. We  followed along as a disembodied hand manipulated the organ through various stages  of stimulation, arousal, and climax. About half way through I started to giggle  uncontrollably. Frank was sitting next to me, trying to avoid the same. When the film  ended the instructor asked what we thought. One girl chimed in that the film was a  profound statement about the poor. Both Frank and I burst out laughing.  There was never anything wishy-washy about Frank, he had strong feelings  about every and anything. He was a handsome guy, but usually didn�t show much  interest in girls unless he could lure them into an intense half-hour one-on-one  conversation. Frank did most of the talking, sharing his art student philosophies  about politics, self-expression, and truth. Once Frank emerged from these  conversations, he rarely wanted to spend much time away from the girl. That is, until  she inevitably told him she�d rather be friends.  Sharon was one of those girls. Though we�d had a few classes together, neither  Frank or I had spoken much with her until a party right before Thanksgiving. Sharon  told Frank that she thought he looked like Michael Hutchence from INXS. Thirty  minutes later they left together.  Two weeks later, Sharon scored the house on College Street, and we all agreed  to live together. During finals week, Sharon told Frank that she wanted to slow  things down during Christmas break. When we showed up to start moving in, there  was Bill.  Despite the smitten lover thing, we were no different than any other new house  inhabitants. We were excited at the newness of living on our own. This was our  place. We could do as we wanted�our own little kingdom. One of our first orders of  business was to set the house rules: who cleans what, penalties for stealing food or  not washing dishes, paying shared bills, and, most importantly, the signaling  procedure if one of us was trying to have sex with a visitor in a common area.  �Well, like, what if I�ve got a chick over, and we�re just starting to make out in  the living room, and I know one of you is about to come home from class,� I  theorized.   �Why don�t you just take her up to your room?� Frank queried.   �But then she�d be clued in too early that I want to screw,� I reasoned.  �She probably already knows that,� quipped Sharon. �What�s the big deal if  someone walks in the house?�  �But what if we�re already starting to take our clothes off? Then she�ll get  embarrassed and leave,� I countered.  �How about this: if you think you might score, leave the trash can outside the  door. Then we�ll know something is brewing and we can ring the doorbell, pretending  that we forgot our key. That will give you time to put your clothes on, or go upstairs,  or whatever,� Frank offered.  Genius.  Despite the expected kitten obnoxiousness, Fernando�s behavior was tolerable  until we held our first band practice. Frank and I played guitar and bass,  respectively, in a new wave band called Infantgarden. Infantgarden wasn�t what  you�d call a �party band.� Our minor chord-laden songs of dread and anguish made  the Cure seem like the Partridge Family. Frank and I would spend hours writing lyrics  about heartbreak, pain, and suicide. To celebrate our new rehearsal pad, we wrote a  love song, entitled �Nihilistic Honor Society,� with the chorus, �The sky above is a  wrinkled grey sheet, when you ask me to swallow your bitter love vitamins. Without  water. Without water.�  About once a month we�d trick some foolish club owner into letting us play. Our  next gig was just a two weeks away. After running through a few songs, we noticed  a low wailing sound emitting from the heat grates. Following a prolonged search and  a few more attempts at practicing, we found Fernando hiding in a furnace duct trying  to escape from Infantgarden.  Fernando�s retributions for our joyful noise came by way of strategically placed  excrement. This morning�s pile wasn�t the first time. Shortly after our first practice,  Fernando had targeted Alex, Frank�s brother and our drummer. Alex was still in high  school and lived at home with their parents. He�d regularly come up for the weekend  and practice. That Sunday, Alex returned from the shower to discover that Fernando  had taken a dump in his shoe. Of course, he didn�t realize this until he was getting  dressed and slipped his foot into the tainted loafer. I imagine the only sensation  worse than discovering that there�s fecal matter in your shoe is realizing that clean  socks and poop-free footwear were an hour�s drive away. We always teased Alex  about his amazingly large feet, but felt bad when none of our offered shoes or socks  would fit him. He faced a terrorizing choice: go home barefoot in the snow and ice,  or wear the offending shoe home.  Sharon was beside herself. She reasoned that Fernando was a sweet cat, he had  never forsaken his litter box before, and certainly this had to be a mistake. Frank  was far less forgiving.  �He took a shit in Alex�s shoe,� he reasoned with her. �It was in my fucking  closet. Even your ignorant cat isn�t stupid enough to confuse a shoe with a goddamn  litter box.�  Sharon started crying. �My cat isn�t stupid,� she pouted.  The following weekend we focused our practice around �Vivisection Buffet�  because Frank wasn�t happy with the lyrics. While �Peel it back, let me loose, fill your  cup, taste my juice,� didn�t exactly flow off the tongue, I felt it had a certain punch  that Frank felt lacked authenticity. Our argument dragged on for hours. When we  gave up for the day, we discovered that Fernando had dropped a load in Frank�s  laundry basket. To add insult to injury, the clothes were just back from his parents�  house, clean and folded.  A few days later, Fernando left a present in the shower. Two days before our  Boone�s Farm game, he had somehow managed to sneak under the pile of fabric,  compressed foam, and broken wood known as �Frank�s chair� and left an aromatic  pattie, leaving us to search all afternoon for the elusive source of its offending stink.  About this time, the honeymoon phase at our abode was clearly over. Our  problems with Fernando had only been the tip of the iceberg. In these few short  weeks, we�d already learned a few lessons about the dynamics of living under the  same roof with people who started off as your friends. My lack of dishwashing and  subsequent experiments in mold cultures made Sharon froth. Sharon was repeatedly  caught dipping into Frank�s milk to make her twenty-nine cent boxes macaroni and  cheese. Alex and one of his high school friends broke a mug given to me by my  grandmother. One evening I learned a subtle lesson in friendship politics when one  of my female friends ended up spending the night with Frank. Money issues entered  into the equation as well.  We�d agreed to live in this house because the rent was dirt cheap�seventy-five  bucks a month each�but the utilities were killing us. Electricity to power all our  televisions, electric blankets, stereos, and band equipment was running well over a  hundred dollars a month, the heat bill from our immense, blowerless furnace was  twice that, water and garbage ran another fifty, and our constant calls to get out of  town gigs made the phone bill an impossible mess. With a new thirty or forty dollar  obligation due each week, plus groceries, school expenses, and �entertainment� on  top of it all�we were all feeling the pinch, especially Sharon.  Sharon�s job at the coffee shop wasn�t cutting it. After one particular day of  serving herbal tea to a bunch of patchouli-scented, graying radicals, Sharon�s tips  amounted to sixty-five cents, two screws, a button, and three lines of bad poetry  about servitude scribbled on the back of a used napkin. It was a step in the wrong  direction from the dollar-fifty and mini-stapler she�d earned the day before.  Within a matter of weeks, we all slowly morphed into a bunch of penny-pinching  misers. One evening I suggested that, since Bill was spending at least four nights a  week with Sharon, plus showering, cooking, and using the appliances, he should  start paying a portion of the utilities. Frank, who had Alex and at least one friend  from home visiting every weekend, wasn�t sure which side of the argument was best  for him and sat it out. Things escalated into a fit of yelling (me) and crying (Sharon)  before Bill turned the channel to the Trinity Broadcast Network.  Despite the growing tensions in the house, we decided to table our argument and  blow off some steam by playing �Around the Farm� with some bottles left over from  the weekend. After a rousing chorus of �What a Friend We Have in Jesus,� the rest of  the evening was a blur. That next morning, Fernando struck again a few inches from  my sleeping head.  When I opened my eyes, I wasn�t quite sure what I was looking at. The smell  keyed me in and I bolted straight up. I stared at it for a few minutes, until Frank  came downstairs. I silently pointed to the poo with a look of sleepy, confused horror.  �Sharon,� he yelled upstairs. �Eric wants to talk to you.�  A groggy voiced echoed down the stairs: �I�m sleeping!�  �You�d better get down here now,� he yelled back. �The Mad Shitter paid Eric a  visit last night.�  Sharon raced out of her room and down the stairs, Bill close behind.  �Is Fernando okay?� she asked.  �Fernando!� Frank yelled. �Obviously he�s feeling a lot better after taking a shit  on Eric�s head.�  �Oh, my God, he pooped on your head.�  �No, he didn�t poop on my head,� I explained. �He pooped next to my head.�  �Oh,� Sharon said with a sigh of relief. �Good�I guess.� She shrugged, gave a  weak smile, and started to go back upstairs.  �Wait a minute,� Frank said. �Don�t you think you should clean up your cat�s  shit?�  �What�s the matter,� Sharon countered. �Can�t you guys clean it up?�  �It�s your fucking cat, clean up its shit,� he responded.  Bill, quiet through the entire exchange, seemed eager to add a sense of reason  and calm to the exchange.  �How do you know its even Fernando�s poop?� he offered.  �What, do you think I took a shit on Eric�s head?� Frank yelled.  �Ferny didn�t poop on Eric�s head, he pooped next to Eric�s head,� Sharon said as  she began to cry and ran upstairs. Bill tried to patch things up by offering to clean it  up himself. Meeting no resistance, he headed for the kitchen.  Bill was an odd match for Sharon�s bohemian new wave art student appearance.  He was an impeccable dresser. He kept his hair very short and neat�always looking  like he just returned from a visit to the barber. He rarely watched television or  movies with us, preferring instead to sit quietly next to Sharon and read. He always  walked around with a paperback book inside a Ziploc baggie. He did this because he  couldn�t bear to read books with dog-eared pages or covers. While he never did pitch  in on the bills, he did most of our housecleaning. The bathroom was spotless, as  were the kitchen appliances. He usually stopped over about half an hour before  Sharon got home and ran up to her room to make their bed from the night before  and do some general neatening. In his last few minutes before she came home, he�d  make his way through the house like a cyclone with a damp sponge or dust rag. I  always thought he did this because he wanted to help out, but I�m convinced he  simply couldn�t stand to be around disorder. We eventually referred to him as  �Sharon�s little housewife.�  While Bill was rummaging in the kitchen, Frank reached around the couch and  found one of Sharon�s discarded shoes. He pressed its sole into the Fernando�s pile,  turning the neat spiral of poo into a thin, spread pattie. Then Frank nonchalantly  tossed the feces-stained shoe back behind the couch. Bill returned from the kitchen  in cleaning gloves, holding a pile of cleansers, paper towels, plastic wrap, and  baggies. He took one look at the compressed pile of poo, and then looked at Frank  and me.  �That isn�t the way I remember it from a minute ago,� he said with a faux look of  exacerbation.  �Perhaps it deflated,� Frank offered, heading for the stairs. �Cat poop does that, I  hear.�  I moved my cushion and self onto the couch, wrapped up in an afghan, and  turned on the television. I pretended not to notice Bill as he melodramatically  cleaned and sanitized the entire living room floor.  Television, as always, bored me, and soon I drifted off to sleep. A few hours  later, I opened my eyes and noticed Frank gingerly walking across the floor. He had  a paper towel cupped in his hands. As he approached, I closed my eyes so he  wouldn�t notice that I was awake.  When I opened my eyes again, I saw him turn the paper towel upside down,  letting a few fresh cat turds roll onto the floor directly in front of the television. Just  a quietly as he arrived, Frank quickly tip-toed back into the kitchen.   I sat up and rubbed my face and hair while staring at the pile in front of the TV.  In his haste to deposit Fernando�s feces, Frank had let some stray grains of kitty  litter fall from the paper towel as well.  A few minutes later Frank emerged from the kitchen. Once our eyes met, I  deliberately looked over at the pile, then back at him.  �Frank, I saw what ��  He raised is finger to his lips, then turned towards the stairs.  �Goddamnit, Sharon,� he yelled. �Get down here�he did it again.�  I pulled the blanket over my head and pretended to be asleep as I heard Sharon  race down the stairs.

      If you read my blog entry from July 31st (about a boy who drowned at the lake where my parents have a "second home"), you'll probably be disturbed to know that the body hasn't been found.  The incident has gone from casting a dark shroud over affairs at the lake to a local obsession.* Whenever residents met--at the post boxes, grocery store, walking down the street--it is always the first topic of conversation. Rumors abound. It's hard to tell what is true and what isn't. The only thing anyone knows for sure is that the boy drowned two weeks ago tomorrow and cadaver dogs, divers, search boats, and even sonar haven't been able to locate his body.  I spent the night there last weekend and had nightmares about him the entire night.** I kept thinking about the body floating by when I was swimming or boating, I kept thinking that his spirit would haunt the lake (and, of course, that he would target me for his spooky activities).  Every time I'd look out at the lake and notice no search boats, I'd always remark how I was surprised that the boy's family wasn't searching for him. "Where the fuck are these people? If it was someone in my family, I'd never stop searching."  This week my father quietly pointed out that the family was there--all day, every day. I hadn't noticed them because they weren't out on the water. The boy's entire family (who don't live at the lake--the boy was visiting with friends) sat in the picnic shelter near the bathing beach, waiting. They'd sit there watching the water. Waiting as patiently as they could.  They've been at this for almost two weeks now. They've waited while the rest of the community slowly gets back to normal. They've sat and watched while people water ski near-by, while children laugh and play on the beach. When I heard that they were there--it started to make sense to me. If it was me, and I had learned that my family member had drowned, I'd probably be the first in the water looking and I'd be the last one looking as well. But at some point, I'd reach the same place that his family are. After a while, I'd just want this to end. In a way, it feels like running around or scouting from the edge of a boat seems easy. It would be a distraction--busy work. Sitting, waiting, keeping vigil day after day for something you know will break your heart. That is tough work.  One of my rules for this blog is that I never mention names of those who aren't public figures. This is my blog and it's bad enough that my friends, family, co-workers, and acquaintances have to know that almost any interaction with me could be documented here.  Today, I feel differently. His name is Bobby.    *=Not entirely local, I live two hours away and I follow the news as if I lived on the waterfront.  **=It didn't help matters that I am generally maniacally scared of ghosts.

      I hate living in a place with one bathroom. Right now I'm doing anything I can (including writing a pointless blog entry) in order to keep my mind off my bursting bladder while my girlfriend (s-l-o-w-l-y) washes her face before bed.

      I got quite a surprise last night. My girlfriend was reading an article on Dave Grohl in  Time  Magazine last night and saw a brief (six word) mention that a new Killing Joke album was coming out this week. I knew that a new album was being recorded and knew that Grohl was rumored to drum on a bunch of tracks--but this news had completely gotten by me. This is especially weird because I read a lot of music magazines--and hadn't heard word one about this album being finished, let alone when it was due to come out.  Now, let me pause for a moment and explain some back story. I love music, I listen to music and think about music all the time. Even considering that, I am not a collector, purist, or obsessive about bands--except one,  urlLink Killing Joke . I own almost everything they have ever done, every compilation, and greatest hits package. I have bootleg audio and video of the band, posters, etc. This is the only band that I have this type of attachment to (someday I'll write about why).  So, anyhow, my girlfriend points out this reference in  Time  and I freak. I run upstairs and check online--and the article is right. The new album, entitled   urlLink Killing Joke  , was released yesterday--that day. It was 8:55 pm and I picked up the phone and started frantically calling record stores. No one stayed open past 9--except Borders. So I gathered myself and my girlfriend and jumped in the car and drove. I was almost silent the entire 15 minute drive, except to talk about how great Killing Joke was and how I couldn't believe that I didn't know this was coming.*  It ended up that Borders didn't have it, but the Best Buy next door was open late (for some unknown reason) and I found a copy there. It has been running through my head ever since--I even had dreams about it last night.  The album is a little weighty and overproduced (it was produced by Andy Gill, of Gang of Four fame--slightly odd because Gang of Four is probably the only other band that I have an even slightly similar connection to), but I love it.** While the album isn't as good as their 1980s work, there is a freshness about it.  The best part of this is that the band is also touring, which is a delight for me. I've always sworn that if they toured again***, I would go on the road following them for at least a week. Also, because there is a new album, that means that there is a bit of renewed interest in the band. In addition to the tour, a rarities album has been released, and a DVD is in the works.  They are the perfect example of a group that is a fraction of its former self, but I love none the less. While I constantly rail against Deadheads, Parrotheads, and all other people stuck on musical pause--I am a bit of a hypocrite, as I could not be more accepting and loving of my pudgy, 50-something Killing Jokesters. It may be pathetic, but today--I feel very alive.    *=There is a Killing Joke listserv that I subscribe to, but I only check the messages about once a month. The list has a tremendous volume of messages and most are arguments over Killing Joke's influence over contemporary bands (boring!). I hadn't checked in since May--and the new album info was still only rumors at that time. I checked again this morning and, of course, actual info on the new album started surfacing shortly after I last checked in. The UK version of the album was released in June.  **=Which was a relief, since their last record, released in 1996, blew hard.  ***=Killing Joke has only toured the US twice in the last fifteen years, in 1991 and 1994. I caught two dates on each tour. They played some sporadic European dates in the late 90s, but nothing over here in nine years.

      That means it's new record day (and yes, I will never get over referring to "albums" as "records").  Finally picked up the  urlLink new Outkast album , though I'm not really enjoying it the way I thought.  I also picked up a cool album from British Sea Power called   urlLink The Decline of British Sea Power  . It has been described as sounding like many earlier groups, such as Joy Division, Echo and the Bunnymen, and the Stooges. While I hear a distinct '80s flavor--I think those comparisons are too easy. The record starts off as a mess, then gets interesting by the third song. It's an example of an album that you can tell--during the first listen--that you are really going to enjoy it.  From all the discs I picked up last week, the surprising hit of the bunch is  urlLink the Peaches record . Nasty, dirty stuff--but really fun.

      Thanks--I needed that.  I decided to take a long weekend away from computers, writing, radio equipment, etc... It felt so good that I could see myself growing a long beard, living in a remote mountain cabin, and writing tomes against the government.  Just kidding. My brother has that covered.  People I know often ask how I find time to write this stuff. Truth is, I don't put that much effort into it (read a bit, you'll agree). I just mentally file things as I encounter them. Except for the BIG entries, I rarely spend more than 5-10 minutes writing any of these. Finding five minutes a day to write about midgets, vomit, and explosives isn't that much of a chore--in fact, it is often therapeutic.  I make it a point to write  something  every day--stories, pieces of books, these entries. It makes me feel productive. Or at least creates the illusion.

      More good new stuff this week. The new Outkast is sold out everywhere, which bums me out. However, I did pick up the new Peaches album, titled   urlLink Fatherfucker  , and just started listening to it. And from the guilty pleasure department, the Rob Zombie greatest hits collection,   urlLink Past, Present, and Future  . He's the Britney Spears of nu metal--but I have to admit that I really like listening to this disc.

      Now, mind you, I don't think everyone at the Akron Beacon Journal should be classified as a "needle dick"--many are extremely cool. There's just a few who have pissed me off (and good) over the past week.  On Sunday, September 14th, the ABJ ran a review of my friend Chuck's book,   urlLink Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs  . The review was a hack job--the writer obviously didn't care for Chuck, his writing style, or the content of the book. That is all fine and good--not every review is supposed to be glowing.  What qualifies several members of the Features department at the Akron Beacon Journal for "needle dick" status (which is several notches above "pin head" status) is revealed in the first paragraph of the review:    "A dart board with a picture of the back of Chuck Klosterman's round, red head -- a noggin that spawned the self-serving cultural criticisms of his latest book, Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs -- sits above my own cranium, splattered with red and blue darts..."   In case you missed that--the Akron Beacon Journal bragged in it's pages that it had a dart board of Chuck's head hanging in its newsroom.   In case this is confusing, let me clarify. Before moving to NYC, Chuck was a writer at the Akron Beacon Journal. Unfortunately, Chuck's talents rubbed a few of the more jealous-types the wrong way and while he is fondly remembered by most of his former co-workers, some of his fellow features/entertainment writers are a bit jaded by his success. In fact, one was overheard saying they were running the review because it will really "get Chuck." To add insult to injury, the review headline read: "Ex-area scribe is full of himself." Of course, mentioning the dartboard's existence in the article is the only public admission of this conflict of interest in publishing a review of Chuck's book.  So, I wrote a letter to the public editor of the paper, which read:    "I found your Sept. 14 review of Chuck Klosterman's book Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs more revealing about your newspaper than about Klosterman's writing. I was shocked to read -- in the review's first sentence -- that your newsroom openly displays a photo dartboard of Klosterman. Is it the Beacon Journal's policy to allow such an implicitly violent gesture toward a former employee and then brag about it in its pages? More disturbing is that the paper's editors would allow for a published review of an author that the staff has such an open and personal bias against. It is understandable if some of your staff members have a degree of jealousy toward Klosterman's success, but please encourage them to keep it to themselves and not pass it off to readers as an objective review of his work. Such sophomoric efforts and bad judgment calls are shameful and just reinforce incorrect stereotypes about Akron and the talents of those who remain here. Considering the immature and unprofessional gestures illustrated in the review and in your newsroom, I hope you are very embarrassed. As a reader, I certainly am. Eric Nuzum Kent "   There are two issues here. Why did the paper run a review at all and why is the dartboard tolerated (and still hanging there today), let alone boastfully mentioned in the paper? The worst part isn't that they shouldn't have (a) run a review and (b) bragged about the dart board, but that at least two or three editors didn't have the common sense to stop it. In other words, this isn't just one person's mistake.  Think this is fishy? So do I. Yet the paper is doing nothing to rectify the situation.  Of course, this isn't a crime against humanity--but it is an example of how the Beacon Journal deals with it's own shortcomings. In this case, they aren't dealing with it well. The dart board should come down, and the paper should apologize to Chuck and its readers for fucking up. No one expects the paper to be perfect, just to own up to mistakes when it makes them. If you'd like to weigh in, the paper's public editor is  urlLink Mike Needs , I'm sure he'd love to hear more about this.

      There is a conspiracy going on in Kent. Our local Mailboxes, Etc stores have switched names. Now they are known as "The UPS Store." While that is fine and dandy, it now makes it really difficult to find a place to drop off a FedEx package. While there are drop boxes all over town, they only accept the FedEx envelopes. Since I periodically ship tapes and manuscripts around, the regular envelopes usually won't do.  Well, I found out that the FedEx drop box at Kinkos has a strange opening on it that allows the slot to expand large enough to accept packages. Today I stopped by Kinkos because I had about two reams-worth of paper to deliver to my agent, thus requiring a large and heavy box.  After I had deposited the box, I noticed a woman was looking at me, very intently. As I walked by she reached her arm out and stopped me.  "Excuse me," she said. "I don't mean to bother you but..."  As her sentence dropped off she started pointing to the self-service cutting machine in front of her.  "I don't think I know how to do this right."  It was very obvious that she, mistakenly, thought I worked there.   I should have straightened her out, but I actually did know how to work the machine. Right after I moved to Columbus, Ohio, in 1993 I worked at a Kinkos for about eight months and mastered all of the funky machines that cut, bound, stapled, and perforated various types of paper and card stock. So, I decided to help out.  "Those are a bit tricky, show me how you want it cut," I said.  We spent the next few minutes going over how she wanted her project cut and setting it up on the machine. Then I instructed her on the subtleties of the machine and coached her on how to use it. I talked her through doing it herself and she seemed genuinely pleased that she had learned a new skill.  "Is that it?" I asked.  "Yes, thank you very much," she said.  "If you need any more help, just ask someone behind the counter over there," I said.  She had a slight look of confusion on her face, even more so after I walked out the front door, got in my car, and waved as I drove away.

      I've spent the morning monkeying with the light switches in my office. It is a pretty overcast day here in Ohio which means there is little natural light coming in my office. It's on days like these where my office has that odd death-warmed-over coloring from the overhead florescent lights.  The problem is that about a month ago one of my overhead bulbs burned out and the maintenance guys replaced it with bulbs that are (a) much brighter than their predecessors, and (b) a completely different color than the remaining bulbs. I have two light switches on my wall, one controls the old light, the other controls the new light. Complicating matters further is that when both lights are on it is so incredibly bright that I expect old people to show up at my door thinking they are crossing over "to the other side." So, every day when I come in, I decide if I'm in a energetic grey mood (new bulb), or a relaxed yellow mood (old bulb), and turn on the switch for that light.  Today, I can't figure out what kind of mood I'm in (the absence of other light makes the choice seem oddly important), so I've been switching back and forth. Neither feels right--so currently I'm typing this in near darkness and hoping that the clouds break.

      Currently reading  urlLink  Diary: A Novel   by Chuck Palahniuk (the same guy who wrote  Fight Club ). The title gives you a general idea of the approach--it's as if you are reading a diary written by a wife to her comatose husband. He did some pretty fucked up stuff before trying to kill himself (and failing--thus the coma). Not a masterwork, but a good read.

      Here is an on-going source of amusement that my girlriend first pointed out to me about a year ago.  urlLink This link  goes to the customer reviews of a CD on Amazon--an import collection of the best of David Hasselhoff.  Currently, there are 734 reviews of this CD. Most of them are fake. It is compounded by the equally large number of reviews for other Hasselhoff releases. Someone put a lot of thought and time into this, and I think it is awesome.

      Just finishing up Anne Garrel's   urlLink Naked in Baghdad  . It is a pretty good book, but there is something missing. I've met her before and she is a compelling presence. What surprises me is that she goes into tremendous detail about the situations she encountered covering the Iraq War for NPR, however she rarely focuses as fine of attention on herself. There are some emotionally revealing passages--but not enough, and not enough detail. I never really get a good answer as to why she covers wars--why she puts herself in such dangerous situations, with little to rely on except for her wit and street smarts, in order to produce radio stories. Seems a pretty obvious question, yet she dances around the answer without revealing why. Ironically, this controlled self-revelation is something she would never let one of her interview subjects get away with. That's just one example though. All this said, it's still a good read.  Also, this has been a busy week for CDs. I've been listening to   urlLink Shine A Light   by the Constantines (Gang of Four retro version 17),   urlLink Permission to Land   by The Darkness (kind of a combo of Rick Springfield, Deff Leppard, and GWAR), and Black Box Recorder's   urlLink Passionoia   (what it would sound like if Nico sang with Kraftwerk--and includes a tribute to Andrew Ridgley--the other half of Wham!).

      Here at ericnuzum-dot-com--we love the poop humor.  Anything involving excrement, flatulence, or any process linked to the two, is a certain source of surefire bellylaughs. However, even I can't make this up. The story of the rarest coffee in the world: poop coffee.  I was recently reading about Kopi Luwak coffee. It starts out with the fruit of a coffee tree and a raccoon-looking thing called a Paradoxurus. Well, these little dudes love the coffee fruit. However, their innards don't process the bean inside of the fruit. The catch: the enzymes in their bodies lightly ferment the beans. Supposedly, this process (and resulting flavor) can only be produced in the little fella's colon. The beans are then "harvested" by farmers who pick through Paradoxurus droppings and then packaging the spent beans for roasting, grinding, and finally--serving to you coffee lovers.  This crap (sorry for the pun) is worth its weight in silver--literally. It costs $700 a pound.  If you don't believe me,  urlLink read about it yourself . Then you can order some. It will probably be the crappiest coffee you've ever had.

      Is my watch.  Before I start this, let me say that even I know this is stupid.  If you look at the picture below, you may notice some droplets of water (under the glass) around the center of the face--right about where the hands meet.       So, moving on...  Those droplets have rarely left my thoughts since Saturday night. Like a dumbass, I wore the watch when I went swimming on Saturday. Obviously, the watch is not water-resistant, or there wouldn't be any droplets caught under the glass. Though the droplets have moved around--they are still there.  The questions that have been clouding my mind: How long will they be there? When they evaporate, where will they go? Will the moisture remain trapped in there and cause my watch to corrode and stop functioning? Will I have to get a new watch? What kind of watch would I buy? Where would I go to buy it?  You get the picture.  Now, mind you, we are talking about a $17 watch purchased at Target that I've owned for two years. Even at a depreciation of roughly sixty cents a month--I think I've gotten my money's worth out of it. At least enough not to care what happens to the water droplets captured inside.  The saddest part is that this watch was also the subject of an earlier obsession: its price. The price bothers me because it cost less money than I paid for my first watch about 30 years ago. Given the amount of inflation that has occurred--how can watches cost  less  than they did a generation ago? I'm supposed to be able to regale youth with tales about how I paid fifty cents for a Rolex back in my day--not how much  more  things cost back then.  It's like cars. Today, the average Ford automobile gets 35 miles to the gallon. The original Model T, introduced in 1908, also got 35 miles to the gallon. That means in 95 years of automobile innovation--we pretty much are exactly where we started.

      Actually, I just got home from Phoenix (but my friend did create a CD compiling seven different versions of that song--including the 18-minute Isaac Hayes version).  Highlights of my trip:   Saw Mars.   Hugged the Pillsbury Doughboy.   Watched some police dogs train to find drugs and attack people.    The police dogs were really cool. Actually, they acted just like normal dogs--the sheriff SWAT team were the cool ones.  I was attending a dinner hosted by the public radio shows  urlLink Studio 360  and  urlLink The Next Big Thing . Whenever you attend these dinners, they give you a great meal in exchange for listening to a pitch about their shows, why you should carry them, etc...   There are two things about these events I usually hate: (a) trying to have conversations at round tables, and (b) strangers--especially public radio strangers--which often have the dynamic and vitality of partially dry mud. This considered, fate cut me some slack that evening. I sat between this girl named Kerrie, one of the Studio 360 producers, who I've known casually for a year or two and is always fun to talk too. On my other side was a guy named Jeff who I've known for a few years (he's often quiet but very interesting once he opens up). In other words, I got very lucky and knew if I could find some fun, they'd be game.  Well, while the program hosts were giving their speeches--we heard the sound of dogs barking outside. BIG dogs; BIG barks. I snuck outside and saw a bunch of police vehicles at the end of the parking lot. I walked down to the collection of SWAT officers and struck up a conversation. There were three dogs and about six SWAT dudes. I quickly learned that these dogs were "dual purpose dogs"--trained for both tracking and drugs. They don't do rescue and they don't do cadaver searches. The dogs require training weekly, some of the SWAT guys do off-duty security at the hotel--so, there you go.  I asked how they trained the dogs to search for drugs. Do they just let them hang around mountains of cocaine?  "Actually, we take a PVC pipe and stuff it full of pot, heroin, cocaine, amphetamine...you name it," said the huge, hulking SWAT dude. "Then we cap it and play fetch with the dog. Over time, we start hiding the PVC pipe and the dog eventually understands that if it finds that scent--it gets to play."  This was, of course, so impressive that I wanted to let others know. I went inside and told Kerrie and Jeff about it (Kerrie said I was skipping when I came back in the restaurant--I don't remember doing that) and we all went outside and watched for a while. It was quite fun and interesting.  While we were out there, we saw one of the dogs track a man. They had the guy (wearing one of those huge padded suits) walk across a field before the dog was released (they also sent out a few decoy people as well to make sure the dog tracked the right person). Then some other officers took a tee shirt the padded-suit-guy had worn wearing and gave it to the dog. The dog hauled ass across the field, grabbed the padded-suit-guy by the arm, and yanked the guy to the ground. The padded-suit-guy was a huge muscular fellow--and this shepard took him down in about two seconds. Really cool.  At one point I asked if the training might back fire over time. Wouldn't it just teach the dog, instead of tracking the smell, to just look for the guy in the padded suit and take him down? The SWAT dude didn't have an answer for that.  Still, they were really cool guys and we had fun talking with them.

      I am really enjoying the new Black Rebel Motorcycle Club album   urlLink Take Them On, On Your Own  . I really liked their first one and this is a refreshing step forward. Refreshing because so many bands are forced to put out follow-ups too quickly, creating an almost inevitable "sophomore slump."  Also listening to The Raveonettes'   urlLink Chain Gang of Love  . It's a pretty good album, but it sounds a little too similar to their first album. The songs are a bit better produced and they have a slightly larger lyrical range--but if you've heard the first one, this one really isn't all that much different.

      It's hurricane season and I love big storms (probably because I live nowhere near hurricane-prone areas). I love watching on television and reading about them in the paper.  The first big storm of this season is "Fabian." Every time I hear that name--I think of the singer. While Fabian was a pretty  un extraordinary singer, I remember him because he was born on the exact same day as my mother.  The whole business of naming storms always fascinates me. I really wish they'd name a hurricane "Eric." That way I could clip the headlines out of the paper that say "Eric hits South Florida--destroys homes and kills ten." Awesome.   Perhaps I could even score a "I survived Eric" tee shirt (I know several ex-girlfriends who'd probably like one of those).  Until they do name a hurricane after me--or at least give it my name--I do have a quick fix: the Saturday soap opera column. It appears that one of the major soaps has a character named "Erica." Every time she is in the column, I clip the "a" out of the headline and hang it up on my refrigerator. So when the column's headline is "Staff plots against Erica"--I hang it on my office door as "Staff plots against Eric."  To make it even better, one of Erica's co-characters is named Michael--which happens to be my brother's name. A few weeks ago I clipped "Bianca saves Michael from the wrath of Eric" and hung it on the fridge.

      The new  urlLink Napster  opened today, and it is great. I decided to pony up for the $9.95 subscription that allows for unlimited downloads (which, of course, expire when your subscription does--plus you can't burn those songs to CDs or an MP3 players).

      Today was Trick or Treat day in Kent. Since we live on a dead-end street, Halloween traffic can be pretty unpredictable. This year's traffic was pretty light--but was still riddled with controversy.  I have simple rules for passing out candy. Everyone who shows up gets one piece of candy. If you say "Trick or Treat," "Please," "Hello," or "Thank you" you get two pieces. Older kids with no costumes get one piece regardless. Anyone who has an awesome costume or is exceptionally cute gets two automatically.  At a few minutes after 3 (Trick or Treat ran from 3 to 5:30) our first group showed up: three little kids who looked like they were just catching on about this candy/costume business and couldn't believe it was true. When I put candy into their bags, they giggled and jumped up and down as if they had pulled something off or won a contest.  The trouble started with the second group of kids. They rang the doorbell and I opened the door. Without saying a word, all four of them shoved their bags in my face. I dropped in one piece in each bag. There was a little girl in the group who did say "thank you," so I dropped in an extra piece. One of her companions saw this and jumped back in front of me, bag re-extended, demanding an additional piece.  "Give me what she got!" he demanded.  "You already got a piece of candy," I responded.  "But she got more, I want another," he said, loudly, shaking his bag.  "Listen," I said. "She said 'thank you,' she got an extra piece. You walk up here, don't say a word, and demand more candy?"  "Come on," he yelled, jumping up and down a bit as he shook his bag again. "Give me what she got."  "I don't think so," I replied. And with that, I slammed the door in his face.  At first, I was appalled at what I had done. In fact, I ws a little shocked that I did this. For a moment there, I felt bad. But for just a moment. Then I saw him bitch about me when he rejoined his friends. I was tempted to run out there and fetch all the candy I had given them out of their bags, but figured someone had to take the high road and let it go.  We only had about fifteen kids after them. We kept joking about this little kid going around the neighborhood telling all the others to avoid our house--like we were giving out pennies or Bible pamphlets or something.  Then we saw another kid, maybe twelve or thirteen, smoking in our driveway. There was no way this kid was old enough to smoke and my girlfriend and I got into an ethical discussion about whether we should give him candy or not, based solely on this smoking thing. Smoking is not covered in Eric's Trick or Treat rules. Then we saw three more preteens smoking--these while accompanying other smaller children--which added a new twist to the "candy for smokers" thing.  Luckily, none of them came to the door themselves--they probably planned to mooch candy off their younger siblings.  Other than that--it was a pretty quiet afternoon. We ended up with a big ass bowl of Jolly Ranchers, mini-Kit Kats, and mini-Babe Ruths. A mixed blessing indeed.

      In a previous blog entry, I listed three things I wanted to learn: how to play pool, how to speak Spanish, and karate. Well, after thinking it over, I thought I'd sign up for either karate classes or fencing classes (a kind of substitution on the list). After a bit of research, I found that the timing was perfect for the fencing class and signed up.  Tonight was my first night.  There are twelve students in my class. Not only am I the oldest student, I am the oldest student by 24 years. Yes, the oldest of my eleven classmates is thirteen; the youngest is seven.  I'm older than some of their parents.  As you can imagine, I was the curiosity. From the start of the class until the end. Everyone watched me, everyone wondered if I'd just leave out of embarrassment. But I figured that my $76 dollars were as green as everyone else's, and I'm staying.  So you can look forward to six more weeks of tales from fencing class.   I'm not even sure where to begin.  We learned how to stand, attack, retreat, lunge, defend, and score--all within an hour. (Sounds like some dates I've had.)  We even had our first bouts. Mine was with a nine-year-old girl named Jori.  She was a wild woman.  As soon as the instructor told us to fence, she came at me, whacking her sword in every direction. She had a look in her eye like she wasn't there to play--Jori was there to win.  As soon as she came at me--I held steady. As soon as she extended to attack, I defended, counter-extended, then smacked her right in the sternum.  Point for Eric.  She kept at it, swinging like a mad woman ever chance she got. I let her score a point or two, but basically kicked some nine-year-old ass.  It wasn't as easy as it sounds--it's hard to strike a target that barely comes up to your navel. It was a lot like fencing a midget, I guess.

      With a last name like Nuzum, I should be the last to goof on someone else's name. But as I was driving around today, I noticed a yard sign for a local candidate which read:  "Vote BOGO for City Council, Ward 4."  Bogo?   Perhaps it is just an Ohio thing, but  urlLink Giant Eagle , one of our local grocery chains, uses the phrase "BOGO" in a lot of its ads, both in and out of the store. To Giant Eagle, "BOGO" stands for "Buy One, Get One"--as in, the second one is free. BOGO signs are everywhere in Giant Eagle.  While I'm sure Mr. Bogo is a nice man, is "buy one, get one free" really an acronym that bodes well with politics?  It would be the same as if Ms. Snafu was running for the local school board, or being introduced to the surgeon about to perform your medical procedure--Dr. Fubar.  It's a little too odd to just write off.  Hey gotta go, have an appointment with my accountant, Mr. Bohic.

      I'm fucking loving the new Windows version of iTunes. I've already blown more money than I should on downloads. The selection is pretty good and the sound quality of the AAC format (mp4) is fucking great. I found an indie record called  urlLink Tabla Beat Science  that mixes Indian tabla drumming with techno beats. And it only cost me ten bucks.  The only problem is that the AAC/mp4 standard that Apple is using--shockingly--isn't supported by Windows Media Player, so everything you download through iTunes has to be played through iTunes. Plus, unless you are using an Apple iPod--you can't load the sound onto your portable player.   urlLink According to Apple , in it's first weekend as a Windows product, more than one million songs were purchased through iTunes. I guess we (those who want to buy and share music online) might not be crooks and thieves after all.

      Currently reading the awesomely funny novel by Neal Pollack called   urlLink Never Mind The Pollacks  . I really enjoyed his last book,   urlLink The Neal Pollack Anthology of American Literature: The Collected Writing of Neal Pollack  , so I thought I'd give this one a try.  This novel follows the adventures of a Lester Bangs-esque rock critic, named Neal Pollack, as he stumbles through rock history like Forrest Gump on a bad acid trip. This book is impossibly funny. It is the kind of  keen funny that, when you read passages out loud, don't sound funny. It has to be taken in as a whole.

      So last night I am fundraising on WKSU when I say something along the lines of "Public radio explores the context of ideas, in-depth, with the hopes of finding a solution or making things a bit better. We aren't like Judge Judy or Dr. Phil, who listen to your problem just long enough to yell at you about what you should do..."  Well, I really pissed off some woman with that comment.  She called in to the station and complained that I was dissing Dr. Phil, who was a great man. She felt I should be ashamed of myself. Then, she called back, and wanted to talk to me. She said, again, that I should be ashamed of myself for tarnishing the reputation of such a gift to humanity. Now, to her on the phone, I was polite and thanked her for calling. To myself, I was thinking that if Dr. Phil was a great man, shouldn't he offer his advice for free? Ghandi was a "great" man; Dr. Phil is a "sales" man.  While his greatness was lost on me, it certainly wasn't lost on this woman. She proceeded to call back and complain again, and again. She called a total of six times.  I wonder how calling up a radio station six times to scream about a single passing remark fits into Dr. Phil's seven steps to emotional health? I guess "Life rewards action."*  Perhaps I just need to buy the book.   *=Rule No. 7 of Dr. Phil's Ten Life Laws.

      This morning my bare ass touched the bare ass of another man.  It happened in the locker room at the Rec Center following my workout as I was getting ready to take a shower (don't most gay porn flicks start this way). I was in the locker alcove (which are fairly small) and I bent over to take off my shorts when another guy (fresh out of the shower) took a step backwards.  Bam. Cheek against cheek.  It really wasn't a big deal. We just half-turned towards each other, grumbled a few little apologies, and finished up as quickly as possible.  Unfortunately and somewhat ironically, my one flaming gay friend (it's okay to call him this, he refers to me as his "token hetro") wrote me an email this morning on a completely unrelated topic. In my reply, I mentioned the incident in a "Hey, guess what happened to me, ha, ha, ha" kind of way, and this was his response:     Oh, get over yourself. This just proves that all you "straight" men are intrigued by other men. You check each other out in the shower or over the urinal wall any chance you get. You are all secretly gay. But on second thought, if you thought bumping into someone's ass was a story worth sharing with me, perhaps you are straight after all.   Most pathetic of all is that I actually expected him to find my "incident" amusing.

      I get a lot of email from people--dozens and dozens a week--asking for help with school projects, interview requests, questions to answer, and requests for resource materials relating to my  urlLink work in music censorship . This happens in spite of statements on my censorship web pages that I will not, under any circumstances, provide any of these things.  My reasoning is two-fold: (a) if a student wants to learn anything, they should learn to do their own work, and (b) if I fulfilled these requests, it would, literally, be a full-time job.  I won't even answer this email, because it makes me so mad that I've spent hundreds and hundreds of hours researching the site, and offer it for free--just asking not to be bothered, then have 20 kids a day write me saying, "Please send me everything you have for my school paper, which is due tomorrow." What dumbasses.  The only exception is someone who (I can tell) has read my book. I won't send them material or give interviews, but I will send a personal reply.  Sometimes, like now, the volume of mail is staggering, and just gets depressing. However, ever once in a while I get one that really makes my day, like this one:   From: Melissa E----- Email address: -----@-------.com Hi! I wrote to you before after I read your book "Parental Advisory" and wanted to let you know that I've been using the information from your webpage for a presentation on music censorship for my Intro to Communications course at community college. I have yet to find a more comprehensive website than yours on the subject. And by the way, I think you're hilarious and very cute!   Right now, I would do anything this young lady asked of me. So learn from this, kids. Next time you write, try saying, "Please send me everything you have for my school paper, because you are really funny and cute."

      As you may know, I work in public radio.  That means several times a year my co-workers and I throw out common sense, rational thought, decorum, and self-respect, then start begging for money.  Just kidding. We don't beg...we ask you to define the value of the programming in your life, think of how much you'd miss it if it went away, and call in your pledge now. Please. Pretty please?  A few years ago during a fund drive I was in the library checking out a book or CD or something. The librarian recognized my name and said that she and her co-workers had been listening to me on the radio all week asking for pledges. She said one of the other librarians thought I had a very sexy voice.  I had no idea how to respond. So, of course, I said the stupidest thing possible.  "Well, do I live up to my voice?"  She looked me over, top to bottom. Her expression was more like sympathy than hot monkey desire.  "I'm sure you are a very nice fellow," she said quietly.  Damn.  "Well, did any of you call in a pledge?" I asked.  "No, we didn't."  Double-dog damn.  Ever since, whenever someone sees my name and asks if I'm the guy from the radio fund drives--I pretend to have no idea what they are talking about.  "A guy with my name? On the radio? Asking for money? How odd."  Then I--and my dignity--walk away unscratched.

      I got out of bed a little after six this morning and shortly thereafter found myself staring at the recent addition to our bathroom: my girlfriend's new toothbrush.  The fact that she has a new toothbrush really isn't a big deal--it happens, like, every other week. She and I have much different philosophies on toothbrush replacement. I will continue to use a toothbrush until all the bristles are bent sideways and have split ends; she will pitch a perfectly good toothbrush at the first sign of wear.  As a result, she buys a lot of toothbrushes. She also falls for just about every crank and gimmick ever devised to sell a toothbrush: color bristles, bending heads, contour shapes, oversized handles, and on and on. But if it makes her happy, so be it.  Generally, I don't care about any of this stuff. Whatever someone uses to clean their mouth is their business, I'm just glad they do it. I have no idea what distinguishes a "whitening" toothbrush (at $3.89) from a conventional toothbrush (at $1.19)--outside of the fact that the purchaser is under the delusion that a $2.70 increase in price will make your incisors brighter. But if it provides incentive for someone to scrub out their nasty piehole so that I don't have to smell it when we're riding in an elevator together--I'm all for it.  However, my girlfriend's new toothbrush is another thing entirely.  It has these rows of hard pink plastic things lining the sides, and a bizarre contour to the handle. To be honest, to my sleepy eyes this morning, I couldn't tell if I was looking at a toothbrush or a sex toy.  I think that is the point. I think it is supposed to look like a sex toy.  If you think I am exaggerating, the toothbrush has its own  urlLink web page  so you can  urlLink see what it looks like .  To make matters worse is its name: The Colgate  Massager . Yeah, right. Gum stimulation was exactly the image they want to project.

      Finally, the last of the major projects by my friends (which all came out this summer) has arrived.  My friend David Giffels is the co-author of a brilliant book about Devo entitled   urlLink Are We Not Men, We Are Devo  .  As with Chuck's book and Harvey's movie, I am very proud of David's accomplishment. He worked very hard on this book (while also working and raising two great kids) and it is an amazing read--fun and informative. Even if your only knowledge of Devo is "Whip It," this book illustrates why this band ws so important and underrated.

      All this talk of food reminds me of a girl I once dated who refused to eat meat.  Was it a health choice? No. Was it an ethical choice? No. She wouldn't eat meat because she once heard of someone who found a finger in some pieces of meat.  Mind you, she didn't see this alleged finger. No one she knew had ever seen this alleged finger. The finger story was probably just an urban legend. But it didn't matter? No. She couldn't stand eating meat because she feared finding a finger.   Unfortunately, the meat/finger situation was just the tip of the iceberg for this chick. It should have tipped me off before we got into all the really weird elements of her personality later on.   After I finally broke up with her, she sat in my driveway for an entire afternoon, refusing to leave until I "started being reasonable." Periodically I'd stick my head out the door and yelled, "Trust me, I'm not worth it."  I didn't see her much after that. About six months later she came home from a bar (drunk) with one of my roommates, fucked him, and made a big deal out of hanging around our house the next morning. She eventually left when she realized that said roommate had left for work without even saying goodbye to her.

      I recently had an email exchange with someone and we ended up getting sidetracked into a discussion about food.  My emailing partner was discussing her aversion to several types of food textures, such as soft foods like whipped cream, puff pastry, chocolate mouse, pudding, custard, angel food cake, and Jell-O, as well as some heavier foods like bundt cake, ice cream cones, chocolate donuts and frozen waffles.  She was very apologetic, feeling bad for admitting that she wants to vomit when faced with consuming a marshmallow. I told her that the last thing she should do is apologize. There is nothing wrong with having aversions to food as long as you (a) never waste food and (b) never are too dramatic about it.  Like me.  I fucking hate zucchini.  I hate zucchini so much that for years I wouldn't eat zucchini or anything that even  touched  a zucchini. I call zucchini the "Devil fruit" and never say the word without spitting out the word with bitter contempt.  Like most psychotic maladies, it all started when I was a kid. When I was about ten, my parents decided they would "get back to nature" (or something equally ridiculous) and started a huge garden in the backyard. They planted everything, including no less than  six  zucchini plants.  No one thought much of it at the time, that is until my father would come in from the garden every evening with two grocery bags of zucchini. We gave away as much as we could, but still had tons leftover. We had zucchini casserole, zucchini bread, zucchini cookies, zucchini loaf, zucchini pasta, four more kinds of zucchini casserole, zucchini salad, and on and on. By the end of the summer, I had sworn off eating zucchini all together.  Then my mother thought she would be funny and started to hide zucchini in my food.  "Do you like your dinner?" she'd ask.  "Sure Mom, it's great."  "There's zucchini in it. In everything: the sauce, the vegetables, even the cake," she'd say, laughing at her four-course zucchini slam dunk.  This happened all the time.  It was the root of my zucchini hatred. Of course, every woman I've ever dated for more than three days has found this utterly ridiculous and has found my "zucchini thing" one of my less attractive qualities.  My ex-wife and one of her friends actually attended a zucchini festival once, just to annoy me by finding the largest zucchini there, buying it, and bringing it home.  And that's just what they did. That fucker was bigger than a watermelon.  I came in the house, saw the zucchini, and could hear the two of them giggling in the other room.  Without saying a world I picked it up, walked out the back door, and pitched it off the balcony.  It would have ended there, except my neighbor was having a barbecue at the time, and the airborne zucchini landed right next to their picnic table and exploded. No one was hurt or hit by any zucchini bits, but they were, understandably, pretty pissed off at me for throwing an giant, exploding zucchini into the middle of their party.  It was one of those situations where the more I explained it, the worse it sounded. I think I lost them the minute I uttered the phrase "Devil's fruit."

      Here is a piece of Eric Nuzum trivia I bet you didn't know...  I used to play the mandolin.  It's true. Actually, playing a mandolin--or at least attempting to play a mandolin--isn't as difficult as you might think. The strings are set up exactly opposite from a guitar--so the lowest string on the guitar is the same note as the highest string on a mandolin. To get started, you just finger chords exactly upside down from a guitar.  When I was a semi-professional musician, I used to occasionally play ballads with just a solo mandolin and me singing. I loved doing it, though I'm sure it was always a bit strange for the four people that were loosely defined as my "audience."  The mandolin has such a poignant, yet sad and subtle sound. It instantly grabs your attention yet, like a guitar and piano, doesn't wear thin too quickly. It isn't, like the french horn--which has its place in music, but not as a solo instrument (boy, I can't wait for all that hate email from solo french horn players).  As you can imagine, a love for mandolins is something that isn't acquired easily, but is forgotten quickly. Someone just sent me a copy of the new  urlLink Nashville Mandolin Ensemble  record (a ten-man group a mandolin jammers from Tennessee), titled  Bach, Beatles, and Bluegrass . It is a lot of fun to listen to, and as the title suggests, it's all over the place.

      Below is a relic: the last surviving Carter Head.        The era of the Carter Heads took place during my senior year in high school.  Mr. Carter was an art teacher who had the classroom next to our art teacher's room. Because our school had two art teachers, there were two art student camps--each thinking their teacher was the better. Our teacher, Mr. Edwards, was, of course, the cool one. Mr. Edwards was a sweet guy; he liked and was very supportive of every student in the art department.  Mr. Carter wasn't. He despised us and constantly accused us of being behind anything that went wrong: stealing his supplies, taking over his display case space, and smudging his example drawings. He felt we didn't respect him and were plotting against him.  If anything, the Carter Heads just proved him right.  Mr. Carter prided himself on his appearance and wore well-pressed, highly coordinated outfits. He thought we (Mr. Edwards' senior art students) dressed like homeless people. He always teased up by calling us "lady killers" and asking where he could buy ripped up jeans, oversized dress shirts, and second-hand trench coats.  One day I came to school with a safety pin in my ear.  "Hey GQ," he called out. "Where can I get one of those things? Does Gucci make those?"  He'd always end these exchanges with an offer to teach us how to dress whenever we decided we wanted to "get up with the ladies."  One day my friend David drew a cartoon of Mr. Carter--the first Carter Head. Underneath was written one of Mr. Carter's favorite phrases, "You give me the blues."  I tore it out of David's notebook, snuck over to Mr. Carter's office door, and taped it above his name plate. When Mr. Carter saw this, he went ballistic, going from classroom to classroom asking who had drawn the picture of him. When he came into our classroom, he immediately focused on me.  "Hey Jordache," he said. "You know who drew this picture of me?"  I pretended to be clueless and Mr. Carter walked off to the next classroom mumbling something about "rectifying this silliness."  The next day, David and I both drew Carter Heads and taped them up in his classroom. Same reaction.  Things quickly grew out of hand. Two Carter Heads a day became four, then four became twenty. Within two weeks, we were running sheets of Carter Heads off on the library copy machine, then distributing them throughout the school. Everywhere you turned, there were Carter Heads: Carter Heads in library books, Carter Heads in the cafeteria fork tray, Carter Heads over the faces on every flier and poster throughout the school. Most of them were small, about the same size as the one above. By our estimation, we had created and placed almost a thousand Carter Heads.  Mr. Carter walked around in daze, it seemed to be the only thing he could talk about. He didn't get it, he'd exclaim. "These pictures don�t look anything like me."  As time went on, Mr. Carter stopped complaining about the likeness and started accusing his provocateurs of racism.  "They might as well draw me in black face eating a damn watermelon," he reasoned.  Despite their ubiquity and Mr. Carter's efforts, we remained anonymous. No one knew who was drawing or distributing the Carter Heads. Or so we thought.   Just when Mr. Carter started threatening to bring the matter to the teachers union, Mr. Edwards suggested we call it quits. He'd known the whole time, but didn't say anything.  "Perhaps it's time this joke ended," Mr. Edwards quietly suggested. We agreed, and eventually all the Carter Heads disappeared.  Over time, various rumors floated around about who had authored the Carter Heads--it was big skuttlebutt in our school. Eventually, the rumors settled on us--and Mr. Carter found out.   We expected the worse, but were surprised when he never said anything to us. By this time the school year was just about over, so we figured that Mr. Carter was just letting it go.  During the last week of class, we started to clean out our art projects and supplies and had them all lined up across the back of the art room. We came in one morning to find that someone had dragged a magic marker across several of David and my drawings. While it could have been an accident (substances get smeared all over an art room all the time), it sure didn't smell like one.  Later that morning we walked out of the art room and passed Mr. Carter's room. He was standing just inside the doorway, looking right at us, arms crossed, nodding his head slightly, with a smile ear to ear.  On the last morning of school, we asked Mr. Edwards for the key to the display case so we could get a few last things out of there. Instead of taking things out, we actually put something in--a massive five foot by three foot Carter Head.  After we locked it in, we walked out of the school for the last time--off to start the rest of our lives. As we reached the student parking lot, Dave opened his hand.  He still had the display case key.  With a nod of approval from me, he turned and tossed the key into the football practice field.

      Yesterday I gave away my guitar.  As I have written in the past, I used to be a performing musician, then I quit, and have never played a guitar since--and happily so (the whole story can be found in my November 11th blog entry).  However, my favorite old guitar, Phil, has always been stored in my basement, just in case I ever changed my mind. It has sat down there, unused, for almost seven years.  Phil has accompanied me on many of my musical journeys. He traveled the country with me, recorded in studios, played on street corners, jammed in dozens of garages and basements, and in front of every crowd (term used loosely) I played in front of for almost ten years. You could see all the road wear on his case. I always kept it clean of stickers, but it had dents and bangs in it from bar room hallways, nicks from coming in and out of trucks a hundred times--Phil's case looked like I had taken it through the apocalypse.  Phil--the actual guitar--was a different matter. I was meticulous in how I cared for it. It was a stock model Washburn acoustic, but I had it modified by at least four different luthiers. Depending on where I was living, and their talents, I'd have them replace parts, add pick-ups, make refinements, then make more refinements.  It was customized in peculiar ways to do peculiar things with its peculiar player. I remember one conversation with a guitar specialist in Columbus, Ohio, about my disappointment at how the guitar would squeak when I beat it (literally beat it with my fist). His advice: stop beating it. I argued that I didn't make it a habit, but sometimes when I was singing and playing away, it just felt right to accent what I was singing by hitting my fist into the guitar--and it would squeak--which I didn't like. This conversation eventually led to him unglueing the entire body to reinforce the bottom half. After that, Phil took a licking, and never rattled again.  I played the fuck out of that thing. It always took it and shoved it back in my face. The guitar was a perfect instrument for me. However, it was also the perfect symbol of how much I needed to move on.  This weekend I spent some time cleaning in the basement, and like I have every other time I've cleaned in the basement, I spent most of the time mentally going through the pros and cons of getting rid of Phil. Every other time I'd gone chicken, but yesterday I packed him into the truck of my car, drove to Goodwill, and left him there.  Over the years I've weighed various departure scenarios for Phil. I thought about destroying him, Pete Townsend style. Perhaps I'd bang out a quick chorus from "Won't Get Fooled Again," then swing him into the floor four or five times. On other occasions, I thought about leaving him in a nightclub, giving him to friends, selling him on eBay (complete with a narrative essay about the instrument and our history). One time, I actually seriously thought about burying him.  Nothing seemed right because all these scenarios focused on me letting go, rather than the best use for the instrument. At some point, I decided to just give him to Goodwill. Up until yesterday, all I lacked was the guts to do it.  To my chagrin, the Goodwill drop center was manned--which meant interacting with people. I figured that on a Sunday afternoon, the store would be closed, or the drop center unstaffed, so I could just drop him off and go.  I was half way out of the car when a jovial woman came up and asked if I needed help.  "No, just have a quick load to drop off."  After a series of short queries about needing a receipt or a hand unloading, I had hoped that the woman would get my subtle hints that I didn't want to talk. She didn't. Dropping off this guitar was a lot like what I imagine its like to drop off a pet at a shelter--a mixture of humiliation, despair, anger, sorrow--and an overwhelming feeling that no polite conversation could ever cover the bases of the situation.  I dropped off Phil first, and then went back for the an box of assorted stuff I brought along as well.  "Look, a guitar," she said, as she hunted for and popped open the six latches on his well-worn case.  "Oh, my goodness, it's beautiful," she said. "Are you sure..."  "Yes, I'm sure," I interrupted, turning back towards my idling car.  At that moment, a young boy working at Goodwill saw the guitar and came over to admire it as well. I couldn't hear everything they were saying, but it was pretty obvious from the conversation that the boy wanted to buy the guitar for himself.  As I pulled around the building, I looked in my rear view mirror and could see the boy holding Phil. His face was glowing and he was struggling to finger a few cords.  I thought about the band he'd try to start playing Phil, the favorite song he'd learn, the girls he'd try to impress...and I knew I had done the right thing.

      I apologize.  I just looked back through my entries over the past few weeks and had one thought:  These suck.  Usually, I enjoy putting a short, but concentrated, period of time each day (usually 10-15 minutes) into writing an entry. Lately, I've been phoning it in.  Forgive me. It will improve.

      You could say I've been working on this piece for twenty years, but realistically, it has only been three.  When I was in high school I used to send cassette love letters to a girl who was living in Finland as an exchange student. Almost two decades later, the tapes worked their way back to me.  The piece, "Hello Finland," is about those tapes and what it's like to listen to them years later.  You can hear the semi-final draft (in Real Audio format) by clicking  urlLink here .  The reason it took three years to finish it is (a) it involved a lot of technical work on an incredibly large archive of tape, (b) listening to my fucked-up teenage self made my skin crawl--every time I had to listen, and (c) this is a difficult story to tell, and tell well.  Hope you enjoy it--hope all the work  doesn't  show.

      My ass feels like I spent the weekend in Cellblock D.  It is swollen, yellow, and bruised.  It is just one injury I took yesterday morning when I fell down my basement steps. I scarpped, bruised or banged my forearm, wrist, left butt cheek, and left heel. Yesterday they nagged, today they hurt like Hell.  It happened because the dustpan had fallen off its hook and landed on a step near the top. It was 6:00 am (dark) and I went down the stairs to bring up some laundry, stepped on the dust pan, and bang--went horizontal.  The amazing thing is that I'm not dead. I slid down the complete set of stairs and got most of my injuries trying to keep myself from tumbling over and banging my head. The only thing I remember thinking while it was happening was how upset my girlfriend would be if she came downstairs and found me passed out on the basement floor.  But I came out pretty well. A little banged up, but it looks much worse than it feels.  This must be what it feels like to get old. No wonder old people live in constant terror of accidents. They are more prone to fall and their injuries are significantly worse when they do.  While I hope I live a long life--I hope that I pass away before I have to live in fear of normal life.

      More new music (this glut of albums always happens before the holidays--then January and Fenruary suck out loud).  Brassy   urlLink Gettin Wise  : An amazing record. It amazes me that this album has been out since August, and I had to stumble across it to even know it was out. I've never seen it in a store, never read a review, never seen anything in fact.  Ugly Duckling   urlLink Taste The Secret  : Hillarious, innovative, and fun hip hop. They are sometimes referred to as comedy rap--which is a mistake. Such a moniker dimenishes their artists cred. They are hilarious, but they are also pretty inventive and out there. The best hip-hop record I've heard all year.

      Iggy Pop's   urlLink Skull Ring  : Rough, real, and totally awesome, but he is so rarely not so. Many reviewers are saying that the cuts with two of the Stooges are the best stuff. I disagree. The Stooges stuff is surprisingly good, but the songs with his normal band rock the hardest and have the best riffs and grooves.  Her Space Holiday's   urlLink Young Machines  : Click-hop with vocals. Refreshing, loose, and fun.   urlLink Stellastarr* : Talk about retro throwback--the debut album from this group that alternatively sounds like The Pixies, The Cure, and a bit of Echo and the Bunnymen--yet still sounds completely original and fresh. And yes, their name actually does contain an asterick at the end. Kind of like a star (or "starr" in their case).

      I think I'm going to buy my own gear for fencing class. It isn't that I've decided to make a long term commitment to fencing--it's just that I can't stand the smell of the fencing gear we use.  The guy who teaches our fencing class travels around teaching different fencing classes throughout the Cleveland area. Before coming to our class he teaches a group of high school boys. That means that all the larger jackets, masks, and gloves have been worn by sweaty boys, then stuffed into a canvas bag for their ride over to our class.  Last night I opened those bags and was overcome by the odor. It was like sticking you nose in the jock strap collection bin in a moldy locker room that hadn't been cleaned in two years.  Then, I had to find the least smelly jacket (which was still pretty damp and smelly) and wear it for two hours. And of course, those teenagers had found a way to even make the mask smell like a overused towel.  I like fencing, I guess I just don't like communal fencing garb.  P. U.

      People are often flummoxed to hear that I "used" to be a musician--and they aren't usually sure what that means, how it is possible, or how I got this way. So, here it is.  Since I was eleven, I played music in bands--throughout high school, college, and up into my late twenties/early thirties.  My performing career came to an end one February evening in 1997. I had just moved to Kent a year earlier and loathed the idea of starting my musical career over again (moving every three years will do that to you). I was playing a solo set at a folk festival--it was the first time I had worked up the initiative to book and play a gig in six months. Before moving, I had been playing solo gigs in my previous home town, Columbus, Ohio. I'd had it with the politics and infighting that accompanied every band I played with and figured that if I wanted it done right--I'd have to do it myself. I was content to play gigs in incredibly small clubs in front of a dozen or so people who were at least pretending to pay attention.  Many of my former band mates had bigger aspirations. The guitarist from my first band--when I was eleven, would end up performing in a string of mustache metal bands that played $200 gigs at biker bars and roller rinks until he went bald and his band fired him. One long-time music collaborator made several attempts to become a career musician, each ending in a melodramatic implosion. Afterwards, he would sell all his musical equipment, then taking a job as a maintenance man or a short order cook. Within a year or two, he'd pick up a guitar to play with friends, the friends would form a band, then write a bunch of songs, beginning another ill-fated stab at glory. Yet another former badnmate actually came closest to the prize. He hooked up with some guys and formed a very popular alternative band in the late 90s. Unfortunately, their sound was about five years too late and they fizzled out under a bizarre record company deal that forbid them from playing or recording even though the label was slowly going out of business.  I was four songs into that folk festival set when I realized that I no longer had any idea why I was standing there. I had totally lost touch with what I enjoyed about playing music and was irritated with everything: pissed that things were running late, annoyed that the person who introduced me couldn't get my name right, honked off that I couldn't hear myself in the monitors, and angry that I was standing here, alone, singing my heart out for yet another crowd that probably wouldn't notice if I keeled over dead. I was playing on a festival bill with a few dozen other performers--most of whom were marginally talented, pasty, middle-aged white guys singing songs about trains. I despised them because I felt that if I didn't walk away right at that moment, I'd eventually end up as one of them. That euphoric feeling hadn't been around in some time. So long, in fact, that I had forgotten how it felt.  I finished my song. In a moment I'd put my guitar in its case. Even to this day, I've never taken it back out again. I've never written a song, played for fun in my living room, jammed with friends, or performed music in any way at all. I'd always said I would play music until it didn't feel right anymore. Standing there in front of twenty apathetic folkies, listening to the dimming sustain ring off my last chord, I knew that time had come. I knew I'd miss it if I quit, but I knew I'd eventually hate it if I didn't. As the guitar faded away, I gently nodded my head, and said a quiet "Thank you" as I walked off the stage.

      Thank God! The boil alert has been lifted!  In an exercise in overreaction, my home town of Kent has been on a "boil alert" for the past two days. No contact with "raw" water--all water for consumption, washing, baths, dishes, laundry, etc... has to be boiled for two minutes before use.  The reason: the city is connecting in a back-up line with a neighboring city and they need to ensure that the water supply remains bacteria free. Of course, these new lines have been sanitized and cleaned thoroughly before use--but there is still a boil alert.  There are a lot of ways this impacts life which are kind of odd: bars and restaurants have been using bottled water and soda, as well as stocking up on ice and using plastic plates and utensils (to avoid dishwashing). The little chaotic touches actually make it a bit fun.  Fun that escapes me, though. I decided it was too much effort and bugged out of town for the weekend. Screw it.

      Why couldn't my school be so awesome:      Students Burn School in Protest Over Disco Ban  NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan students set fire to their school, ransacked the kitchens and looted computers in a three-hour orgy of destruction after teachers banned video shows and discos, newspapers reported Monday.  Police using tear gas dispersed teenagers at the Kinyui Boys School in eastern Kenya after many of its 760 pupils went on the rampage Saturday night in protest at the ban, which teachers said was designed to give them more time to study.  "I wanted the Form Fours to have time to concentrate on exams," the school principal, Herman Kasini, told The East African Standard daily, which carried pictures of a gutted dormitory and a collapsed corrugated iron roof.

      I've been in and out of town a lot lately, catching a bunch of shows on the  urlLink Killing Joke  tour.  Several years ago, when Killing Joke stopped playing together, I vowed that if they ever toured the US again I'd see as many shows as possible. They did, and so am I. Unfortunately, life also gets in the way, so I can't just take off and follow them around for a month. I have seen four of the twelve shows: DC, Cleveland, Detroit, and Chicago.  This is not something I would normally do, but this band has meant a lot to me over the years since I first discovered them in 1985. At the time I was listening to R.E.M. and Bruce Springsteen (after recovering from an extended heavy metal fascination in my early teens). To me, Killing Joke was revolutionary. I had never heard anything like it. I am an unabashed fan--not necessarily because of the music, but because what this band has meant to me throughout my life.   Going along on part of this tour was a lot more than hearing my favorite bands--it was more about saying goodbye.  In all likelihood, this is the last time that Killing Joke will tour the US. It will be the last chance I get to see them. That makes me both happy and sad. Happy because I have the opportunity and ability to do this, and sad because I am closing a chapter in my musical life.  When I started home yesterday, I felt I was ready to do so. But since I've been home, I wish I could have stayed on the road and seen more shows. I didn't want it to end.  Perhaps its best if that's how I leave it.  Here is a picture of me with the singer, Jaz Coleman, at the show in Detroit Friday night.

      I spent Halloween night in Detroit (and no, I was in no danger of burning--the fires happen the night before Halloween). I was in a club for one of the Killing Joke shows I'm attending when I noticed a few people in animal costumes. It appears these people were furries.  Before this evening, I had never heard of a furry before.  Apparently furries are people who get quite a bit (read: a little too much) enjoyment out of dressing up in furry animal costumes and going out into public. They ask people to scratch their backs, give hugs, dance for people, and so on. There are even some fetish implications that make something creepy into something really, really creepy. Apparently, there is quite a furry alt-culture. Here is a  urlLink link  for everything you'd ever want to know about furries.  The furry I spoke with was  just a little  drunk. He had added a metal mask to his fur Gumby costume, proclaiming himself "Evil Gumby." I had someone take a picture.

      Since I was old enough to hate certain aspects of myself, I've played the same New Year's resolution game that everyone plays: lose weight, be a better friend, be nice, and so on. Every year I make these sincere promises to myself, then fail miserably. Bearing this mind, for 2003 I took a different approach, which has proven very successful.  My resolution for 2003 was to have random anal sex with as many complete strangers as possible.  Unless today is more eventful than I anticipated, I completely failed this resolution as well, as I did not have random anal sex with anyone. You see, my tactic is to make a resolution to do something I have no interest in doing at all. That way, when I fail, it is a zero sum game.  I think.  Well, I'm convinced it works.  My resolution for 2004: develop a nasty crack or heroin habit (preferably both).  Happy New Year.

      The votes are in and it was a tight race. Thanks to your votes, the winner of the award for "Most pathetic holiday house display in my neighborhood" is:      The "J" house    As you can tell from the picture, they ran out of lights part way around the door. Even though Target had lights on sale for $1.62 a strand--it was, obviously, too much effort to finish the job. The house stayed this way for the entire Christmas season. Thankfully, they took all their lights down the day after Christmas.

      I can't remember jack shit.  Not about things that happened when I was seven, seventeen, twenty-seven--before I started writing this, I forgot my age. Seriously. (I'm thirty-seven.)  So, as a result, I am constantly on the trek to document my past. Not because I think anyone will ever care--I just won't remember it otherwise. If I remember an event, or a friend recalls a story of something I did--I always write it down before it disappears again. Hell, people could have been making up total bullshit about me for years and I'd never know the difference.  For some reason, I ended up with a few reels of 8mm film that I don't ever recall seeing. I was told that my parents bought a camera and projector around the time of my birth, took a bunch of reels, and then lost interest.  A year or two ago, I noticed that these reels were starting to decay. There were three reels, each a bit brittle, but one was growing some kind of dry mold. It has been nagging me since to do something with them. I had seen a few other family mementos lost to lack of attention and/or ignorance--and I wanted to preserve them before they were gone.  So this year I decided I would get them all transferred to DVD for a Christmas present for my parents. The people at the video transfer place couldn't have been nicer. It was expensive ($120 for a 30 minute DVD), but worth it. I am a protector of family memories, right? Plus, the video people reassured me that they had ways of treating the moldy film so that it would stop deteriorating and get a decent transfer.  I went to pick it up at lunch today and watched the whole thing. It was amazing and fun and funny and touching to see 30 minutes of film chronicling my first eighteen months--including relatives that have changed dramatically, aged, or died.  When I started to prep the stuff for wrapping, I noticed the invoice said they could only transfer two of three reels.  Damnit. The one with the mold must have been too far deteriorated to transfer. Damnit, damnit, damnit. Perhaps if I had done this a few years ago, I would have been able to save it. I was pretty pissed at myself.  Then I looked in the bag and spotted a note was attatched to the moldy film reel.  It said: "Adult film, did not transfer."  I ran upstairs to grab my magnifying glass and looked at the tiny film strains. It was true. In with two reels of family memories was a black and white skin flick.  I had a weird thought at first: might I know these people? So I unwound the film a bit and started to look it over with the magnifier. Thankfully, no relatives, family friends, or other familiars were featured in the film.  The worst part of this incident is the question--what if they  had  transferred that film with our other family movies? I can see it now. All my relatives gather together on Christmas day, we put in the DVD, and enjoy a half hour of memories. Then, the image switches from color to balck and white and--well, we'd definitely few new Christmas memories at that point. I'm sure future generations of Nuzum's will gleefully recall the Christmas that Grandpa Eric showed the family a porno.  My parents are in so much trouble. I can't wait to give them some grief about this.  I guess this clears up the  real  reason why they got interested in 8mm film.

      Hello Finland is my latest radio piece, an audio documentary. It has its own  urlLink web page .  Here's the scoop: Between September, 1983 and May, 1984, my friend David and I made a series of cassette tapes for another friend, named Deneane, who was spending a year in Finland as an exchange student. On the "A" side of the tapes, David and I performed goofy skits and stories. On the "B" sides, I'd record audio diaries about my life as a seventeen-year-old boy in Canton, Ohio.  Over those nine months, the nature of the tapes, and the relationships they chronicled, changed dramatically.  Eighteen year later, I came across the tapes and listened to every one. They reveal a rare and intimate glimpse back in time.  urlLink This piece  features exerpts from those recordings and offers my reflections on what I heard.

      When I was a kid, one of my favorite holiday activities was Christmas caroling door to door. This was somewhat complicated by the fact that we lived in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood.  When I was nine, we moved to the Northwest section of Canton, Ohio. For reasons that were never explained to me, many of the residents in my neighborhood were Jewish. Two synagogues and the Canton Jewish Community Center were all located within a half-mile of our house. Some blocks, like mine, we almost entirely Jewish. Most of the Jewish neighbors were old...really, really old. They were all the first or second owners of their homes and seemed to have all built in that neighborhood en masse. Over the years, a few gentiles had moved in here and there. We bought our house from the Friedmans (it still had a mezuzah on the front door frame, which remained there when my parents sold the place fifteen years later), lived next door to the Hendlers, across the street from the Goulds, and catty-corner to Mrs. Schwartz.  Living in this neighborhood was never a big deal to me, in fact, I never gave it much thought at all until I realized (years later) how unique it was. As a child, I though every neighborhood had lots of Jewish people.  Things did get a strange vibe around Christmas...because only the gentiles would put up decorations. As a result, we'd all stick out like sore thumbs (one of our fellow Christian families, the Capawinos, left a ten-foot rot iron "NOEL" on the front of their house year-round).  When I was about twelve, my buddy Tim, my brother, and I got the idea to go caroling. No practice. No idea if we all knew all the words to any song. We just put on our coats and headed out.  We went to the Capawinos house (figuring that they would  really  enjoy the carols). Mrs. Capawino answered the door, and the three of us decked some halls. She did enjoy it. So much, in fact, that after we were finished she reached for her purse and handed us a dollar.  A whole dollar.  For one song.  We ran to the next house that had Christmas lights and knocked. An old man answered the door and we jingled some bells. He smiled throughout and seemed really tickled by us. After we were finished, he walked back into his house and returned with a fistfull of candy.  A fistful.  For one song.  We thought we had stumbled across the best scheme (legal or illegal) ever devised. We combed our neighborhood, hitting every house with any kind of wreath, colored lights, or visible Christmas tree. Within a half hour we had accumulated about $4.00, pockets full of candy, and were nursing some hot cocoa from our last visit. Drunk with excitement over our booty, we decided that we'd visit the Jewish houses in our neighborhood, too.  We visited Mrs. Schwartz first (Mrs. Schwartz was better known as the "Candy Lady"--you'd knock on her door and, without answering the door, she'd throw a few pieces of candy out the mailslot). She answered the door and listened as we sung the tale of the first Noel (a good choice, we figured...since she was Jewish, she might appreciate knowing what all the fuss was about). Afterwards, without saying a word, she gave us each a few pieces of candy and closed the door.  It worked!  Next was Mr. Gould, who answered the door and immediately assumed that if three kids were knocking on the door after dark they meant to either rob him or return something they had previously stolen. Before we had finished the first verse of "Silent Night," Mr. Gould started to belly laugh and shut the door.  A setback, but we decided to march onward. We continued going house to house, for a full two hours. Most people had the same reaction: at first they were confused, then they started to enjoy the moment, and by the time we finished our song, they'd be smiling and thank us.  And give us money.  And give us candy.  And give us bottles of soda pop.  Some even wished us a Merry Christmas, and meant it.

      So far I've had a number of people voting for the most pathetic holiday display (#5 is the current leader). I've received several comments too, including my favorite:    "Why don't you ridicule your own house? Do your neighbors know that you are making fun of them on the web? What a mean thing to do, you must be an asshole."  Thank you, I hadn't figured that out yet.

      Kent, Ohio is known for many things.  Check that.  One thing: shooting students.  But if it was to be known for anything else, it would most definitely be known for it's lame holiday displays.  Christmas is supposed to lift spirits, not depress people because their neighbors are either (a) too stupid to realize their holiday decorations look terrible or (b) don't care.  Below are ten of the lamest, dullest, most-uncoordinated, and simply awful displays in my neighborhood. They aren't necessarily the gaudiest or most over the top, just pathetic--each in their own way.  You can vote for which one is the worst by following  urlLink this link .   House number 1: The "buy a ladder" house    This house would just be mildly annoying if it weren't for the blue lights. This homeowner didn't even make an effort to get the light strings into the trees. It looks as if they just stood in front of the tree and threw the lights into the tree. As a result, they enemically hang front the branches.     House number 2: The "Christmas overkill" house #1    This is a notorious house in our neighborhood. It looks like Christmas threw up all over the damn thing. Unable to commit to any individual decor scheme, they try everything, at one. I know the girl who lives across the street. She claims that the glow from this display lights the inside of her house bright enough to read at night.    House number 3: The "J" house    Oh, come on. Run out of lights 2/3rds of the way around your door? Just leave it like that!    House number 4: The "rim it" house    At least this house started with a premise: outline every edge and angled surface with lights. Too bad they fucked it up. If you are going to line the perimeter of the windows, at least cover up the extra lights so that you don't have a "line" of lights connecting the windows.    House number 5: The "Christmas overkill" house #2    If you don't have a design in mind, just cover everything with BRIGHT LIGHTS!    House number 6: The "ho hum" house #2    There is no specific reason this house is lame--it just looks depressing.    House number 7: The "veil" house    This is an odd one to see as you drive past. These folks took one of those light nets made to cover a bush and strung it up from a tree, creating this box of light. If you don't know how to use the lights, leave it to those who can read the instructions.    House number 8: The "we do this every year" house    It's hard to tell from the photo, but the lights on this house look old. Old in the sense that if you drove past this house twenty years ago, you would have seen the same lights, in the same positions. These people probably still sit around listening to Gordon Lightfoot and playing with their Rubick's Cube.     House number 9: The "resource allocation" house    Some of the siding is falling off this house, the color on the left side of the house doesn't match the front of the house and there is plastic on some of the windows instead of storm windows--yet they somehow find the money to cover the place with lights. Time to rethink what to do with that disability check.    House number 10: The "electricity bill" house    While the decor is uniform, the overall effect is quite garish. You can see this house glowing four blocks away. To make matters worse, all these lights flicker or move.  There you go...time to vote.

      If you like  urlLink The Onion , you've got the perfect sense of humor for this site.  urlLink Welcome to the White House - WWW.WHITEHOUSE.ORG  is a fake White House site, meant to resemble the  urlLink actual White House web site .

      Today was Cookie Day.  It's a new family tradition. For the third year running my parents, grandparents, Miss Kitten, and I all gather together one Saturday in December and bake cookies for 10-12 solid hours. Then we divide up the booty and take them to our offices, holiday parties, social groups, etc...  Today we made 11 different varieties of cookies, including three batches of sugar cut-outs, Russian tea cakes, peanut bloomers, date rolls, chocolate chip, snickerdoodles, and a cookie Miss Kitten and I are calling...Little Nasties.  Their technical name is Fruit Drops. The look (and taste) like a cookie version of fruit cake. Here is Miss Kitten modeling a  Fruit Drop , I mean Little Nastie, for you.       The whole cookie/fruit cake relationship is pretty gross. To be frank, if you ate nothing but fruit cake--this is what you could expect to pass a few days later.  Further, they are absolutely the most disgusting thing you've ever tasted. While the combo of nuts, candied fruit, and dough might read well on paper, it tastes exactly how it looks...like shit.  My mother and grandmother claim Fruit Drops are their favorite Christmas cookie. As a result, we make, like, twenty dozen of them. We end up with piles of  Fruit Drops /Little Nasties everywhere.  I'm sure you've heard all the jokes about how no one actually eats fruit cake but just keeps giving them as gifts along down the line. Well, we thought up similar roles for Little Nasties.  Going to a holiday party out of obligation, or hosted by someone you don't like? Pack some Little Nasties.  If you see someone who has tastelessly decorated the exterior of their house (at least 95-98% of persons doing so), you could throw a bunch of Little Nasties at their house (or as an alternative, leave a burning bag of Little Nasties on their stoop).  The fun is over whenever we think of how we are going to get rid of our shoebox-sized container filled with Little Nasties. I entertained the idea of throwing them out into the yard for the squirrels, but Miss Kitten worried the squirrels might throw them back.  In all likelihood, we'll save them for New Years Eve. Drunk people will eat up the Little Nasties. And if they throw them up...well, we can just put them back in the box and save them for next year!

      Here's an example of something that really fries my eggs.  Below is the original cover artwork for The Distillers' album  Coral Fang , which came out about two months ago:       Now, while this album (with this cover) was on sale, briefly, everywhere, if you visit many major retailers today--you see this:       Among advocates of free expression and music, there's some consternation about album artwork. At one time, it was a sincere and personal reflection of the artist's vision, expression, and wishes. However, today, it rarely is. Album artwork is part of the marketing of the album and often the artist has little or no say in what graces the cover of their CDs.  Not the case with The Distillers. They commissioned an artist named Tim Presley to do the original cover. But Wal-Mart balked at the original cover. I guess in the age of John Asscrack spending $8,000 of taxpayer money to cover the statues in the Justice Department lobby, the idea of showing a simple artist's rendering of woman's breasts is "too explicit." Wal-Mart said they wouldn't carry the Distillers' album with the original artwork. Since Wal-Mart sells one out of every ten CDs in the US (and in some areas is the only retailer left that sells CDs), if Wal-Mart says no--it can really damage an album's chances for success. So companies change the artwork. Often (as in this case) with no voice given to the artist.  But wait, I hear you saying, anyone who doesn't want to buy the revised artwork can go to another store.  Wrong.  When I bought this album at Best Buy (which generally does not stock "altered"or "clean" versions of albums), the only one available for sale  was the altered artwork . More than likely, the record company filled Bet Buy's order with the altered cover. An innocent gesture, but it still is the sickening start of a slippery slope.  Changing the artwork is a stupid gesture meant to appease people who would never have bought a Distillers album in the first place. Call me a simpleton, but it I don't want to see a CD like that--I won't buy it. If I don't think it is appropriate for my kids, they can't buy it. If they really want the CD, and I have a problem with the artwork, then I'll buy it, remove the artwork, and give it to the kid. I don't need Wal-Mart to do that for me.  You may think this isn't a big deal. Taken by itself, it really isn't. However, in the context of the music retailing industry, it is prophetic. Today, no breasts. Tomorrow, no drug-related images. Next week, only "appropriate" displays of patriotic symbols. Next month, nothing critical of government or major corporations.  I may sound a bit paranoid, but this is how things like fascism start--with a simple gesture that really isn't a big deal. A few more little deals later--and you have compromised everything.  Think about this the next time you walk into a Wal-Mart.  Instead of filling your cart with a bunch of cheap crap you probably don't need--why not stand up for something--and walk out.

      Last night was my last beginner fencing class. As you may recall, this was supposed to be an adults and children's class--but I was the only adult who signed up. I plan to continue taking fencing class--but I'm sure it wo't be nearly as much fun. Last night, most of us got together for a picture.  The instructor and I are in the back on the left (as if you couldn't pick us out on your own). This is almost everyone, except for two of the younger kids who were two distracted by each other to make it into the picture.

      Old list, recently updated and revised:     I trust people yet am skeptical of institutions.  Given the choice, I�ll usually decide to spend time by myself.  I regularly turn concerns into obsessions.  I love movies. In my ideal world, I�d have the time to watch a different movie every day.  I wish I were smaller.  I talk too much and don�t care.  From the ages of seven to thirteen, I listened to Casey Kasem�s American Top 40 every week and charted the top records on a notepad. I considered this important work.  I want to love unconditionally and often fail.  I strive to be a generous person.  I am oddly proud to be part of the �Gen X� demographic group.  I am an opponent of smoking and smokers� rights, yet I steal (and smoke) cigarettes from my girlfriend almost nightly.  I admire passion.  Learning invigorates me.  I enjoy meeting new people.  I am easily bored.  I don�t like telephones. If it weren�t for work and family emergencies I would never use them.  I forgive easily and gladly.  I am a fan of nostalgic kitsch.  I spent my teenage years in a near constant haze of drug use, yet�as an adult�have little tolerance for inebriation and illicit substance use.  I believe everything happens for a reason.  I don�t have enough time or energy to do everything I want.  I don�t like cats, yet the only pet I have is an eight-year old cat that I�ve raised since his mother abandoned him when he was two-days old (probably for good reason). He is unpredictable and mean. I consider his presence in my life as a lesson to me, yet I�m still trying to figure out what that lesson is. My girlfriend and I both have scars from his tantrums.  I prefer non-fiction.  I don�t tolerate fools well.  I sincerely believe in the existence of God, yet also believe it is impossible for humans to understand or quantify that existence.  I am very proud of my accomplishments.  I hate zucchini and consider it evil. Seriously.

      Bought two records today, first new records of the new year--one is great, the other is crap.   Great:  Elbow's   urlLink Cast of Thousands  .  A unique band, a bit gritty, a bit slow, yet still rockin'. They are getting a nice push from their label because they sound a little like Coldplay. I hear it, but I think such comparisons don't due Elbow much justice. If anything, they are the parts of Coldplay that you like.   Crap:  Starsailor's   urlLink Silence is Easy  . This is the part of Coldplay that you hate--the overblown, whimpy, garbage that just makes you want to puke. This is sad because I really liked their last album and bought this one without hearing anything from it. The last album, plus the buzz about this disc, made me think it was worth the risk. It wasn't. I listened to it on the way home, pulled the tracks as MP3s, and then immediately listed it used on Amazon. It isn't even worth a second listen. Yech.

      On Sunday, my last day in LA, I had one of the greatest radio experiences of my life--listening to the Jesus Christ Show.  It happens every Sunday morning from 6 to 8 a.m. on this giant LA talk station, KFI-AM. This guy comes on and says he is "your holy host, the lord and savior Jesus Christ." Jesus Christ takes calls, gives advice, quotes scripture, ask people to pray  to  him. It's pretty wild.  The genius of this show is that it isn't heavy religion nor in any way blasphemous. It is kind of religion-light, with a heavy emphasis on support and comfort. People call in with all kinds of problems--kids on dope, shady business deals, rocky marriages. Jesus listens to them all (and take occasional breaks for news, traffic, and weather--and no, Jesus doesn't do the traffic--a reporter does that while Jesus takes a break). For the callers, it is a cathartic experience. People cry, they thank Jesus, they tell him they will update him when they pray. Of course, these people know he isn't actually Jesus Christ, but to them, at that moment, it simply doesn't matter.  To them, the holy host is a lot like Santa Claus.  For the audience, it is gripping radio. I'm hooked. KFI does  urlLink stream the show online live , so you can listen any Sunday morning you like.   The show has a  urlLink web page  (it is under the Hosts section--the holy host Jesus Christ is listed just under Dr Laura) and even allows you to send "Holy Mail" directly to Jesus!  Halleluiah!

      The other night I'm in Los Angeles and planning to go to dinner with a group of 13 public radio people. We made some calls around and, surprisingly, the cheapest and easiest way to move all of us around for the evening (we are also making some other stops as well) isn't taxis or busses, but limos. So we make a reservation and consider it settled.  Later that evening, a forty-foot stretch Hummer limousine pulls up to take us out for the evening. The back fits all 13 of us, comfortably. It was totally tripped out. Champagne, lights (and light controls, which everyone had to play with), stereo, moon roof, neon--you name it. I felt bad for some of the tourists we drove past. They see this shiny black tank roll up and expect for Brad Pitt to jump out. They look (really) disappointed when a dozen or so public radio nobodies spill out the door.  Our driver was a very nice and patient man named Robert. He answered all our questions, let us constantly roll up and down the windows, and didn't roll his eyes while we acted like the Beverly Hillbillies on crack.  However, at the end of the night, I was sitting towards the front of the limo and was talking with Robert. At one point, Robert stopped our conversation and asked if I could indulge him for five minutes. I thought he meant a five-minute conversational diversion until he twisted the wheel and sent the limo down a sidestreet.   Robert started talking about the "real" side of LA and a place called "Tent City." He felt it was important that we see it. He said he always brings his business clients down through here, even if it is out of the way, because he wants them to experience "reality."  Tent City is a super-sized version of something you see in almost every large city with a temperate climate--an abundance of homeless people. In Tent City, there is city block after city block of tents, each filled with families, addicts, victims, and just...people.  At first I was overwhelmed--it just kept going and going, block after block. So many people and faces. Then, after he took us back to our hotel, I was a little pissed at Robert. I felt he was either taking advantage of our cordial conversation or thought we were stupid and ignorant to these peoples' plight. It felt like a guilt trip. I get plenty of those on my own without having to go on a limo ride for one.  Since then, I'm not quite sure how to feel, but I'm not angry at Robert for taking us. In many ways, it was kind of symbolic and somewhat ironic. Here we were, riding in this HUGE THING and we all felt kind of giddy and awestruck by this HUGE THING we were riding in. Perhaps what Robert did was just expose us to another HUGE THING. Something that, like the forty-foot Hummer, would get our attention and leave us with something to talk and think about.

      Last night Miss Kitten and I watched  urlLink  Gigli  --the Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez movie.  As I've mentioned in the past, I tend to have really low standards for movies. I go see crappy movies all the time and laugh, feel my heartbeat rise at their modicum of dramatic tension, and (though I hate to admit it) I get misty at stupid movies all the time.  Unless you live under a rock, you know that this movie was universally panned when it came out. It was so bad that not even the whole "Bennifer" media storm could get movie-goers into the theaters to see it out of a sense of curiosity. It lasted two weeks in the megaplexes, bringing in a total of $5.6 million.  It and  urlLink  From Justin to Kelly   made 2003 a banner year, the only time in the 100-year history of cinema that two movies released that year were added to many critics' "Ten Worst Films of All Time" lists.  All that said, I tend to think a lot of people jump on the bandwagon when they hear a movie sucks--they read or hear bad reviews and just repeat them as fact. In reality, a lot of these bad word-of-mouth films aren't so bad after all, just the victim of some bad buzz. It's a lot like when your English teacher asks you to stay after school, then offers you cocaine, asks you to dress up in a Big Bird costume, and has sex with you on her desk. Then someone walks in, catches you, spreads it all over school, and everyone thinks...oh, never mind.  So I rented Gigli, figuring that it may suck a little bit, but might not be nearly as bad as I thought.  Then we watched it.  The hyperbole of others aside, it really is that bad.  We sat watching with our jaws on the ground. Not because of the story, but because we couldn't believe the acting was so bad. The local "short bus" school's rendition of "Our Town" featured higher caliber performances than this stinker. It wasn't just "bad" bad, it was "mind-numbing-I-can't-believe-this-millionaire-couple-didn't-buy-the-movie-back-to-keep-it-from-ruining-their-careers" bad.  Literally, I don't think I have ever seen worse acting. And not just terrible acting from Ben (who was, incidentally, the worst of the worst--who ever thought this idiot could act?), but the entire cast. The plot is like a combination of   urlLink Rain Man   and   urlLink Get Shorty  , though I don't have much of an opinion about the story. This is basically because I couldn't get past the acting long enough to understand what was supposed to be going on.  Usually, I treat bad elements of pop culture like spoiled milk. You know--the milk is spoiled and what is the first thing your girlfriend/boyfriend/husband/wife/roommates says..."Eew, taste this!" In other words, I usually say, "Eew, this book/movie/album is so bad, you have to read/see/hear it!"  Not this. Skip it. Nothing to see here folks. Life is too short.  If after reading this, you are still interested in watching  Gigli , you need to get some new hobbies.

      I meet a lot of people. I mean a lot. Often I find myself in social/professional situations where I have to make conversation with strangers. It is taxing, but I'm pretty good at it.  The easiest way to do it is just ask a million questions about them. Most people enjoy talking about themselves and the things that interest them. You can start with some perfunctory questions about employment, then once some comfort is established, you can move into hobby and family questions. If you make it that far, you could keep up the question thing for hours, quite effortlessly.  However, every once in awhile I am confronted with a tough nut. He or she is either shy, social inept, uncomfortable, or evasive.  That is when I bring out the big guns. The five questions.  If I need to disarm someone's social barriers or get to know someone really fast (like a good friend's new love interest), I ask these five questions--always the same five questions.  Regardless of the circumstance, by the time they are done answering, I feel I have a pretty good idea how they look at the world.  The five questions are:     Are there or where there ever aliens captured in Roswell, New Mexico. Yes or No?  What did the Tooth Fairy bring you in exchange for your childhood teeth? Did you think this was a fair exchange?  Do you believe that Jesus of Nazareth was the son of God. Yes or No?  Would you rather be smart or wise?  Did O.J. Simpson murder his wife. Yes or No?*    *=Lately I have been substituting "Do you believe Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction?" For the O.J. question.   There is a trick to these questions. The respondent will usually give you a quick answer, many will be one word. The key is to ask them at least three clarifying questions about each response.  For example: The person doesn't believe in aliens at Roswell. So you ask why? They respond by saying that if they were found, the government would have acknowledged it. You ask if they believe that the government always acknowledges controversial/scary/unsavory things?   You get the point.  It leads to some interesting Q&A. By the time they are done, you've figured out a lot about them and what makes them tick.  Feel free to try it yourself, it's fun. Just don't take credit for them--or I'll sic some Roswell aliens on you!

      I never have enough energy. I always run out of steam, or get cranky, luggish, and tired--way before I run out of things I want to get done in a day.  Complicating this is the fact that I don't like to sleep. Well, it isn't that I hate sleeping in any way, I just want to spend as little time as possible asleep. I stay awake every evening until I can't keep my eyes open any longer and am awake by 5:45 every morning. And when I get up, I'm up. I don't leisurely sit around "waking up"--I hop out of bed and start doing things shortly thereafter.  I wasn't always this way. During my college and post-college years, with their complimenting lack of steady employment and set work hours, I routinely would stay up very late at night and slept for about twelve hours. At that point in my life, I slept so much because, outside of chasing girls and drinking, I didn't have an awful lot of constructive activities to fill my time.  My late-night habits stayed with me throughout my early 30s (reinforced by dating a woman who worked 3rd shift), but ended about 2000 when I, quite suddenly, became a morning person. It was a revelation. Here was this early-morning world, heretofore hidden from me, where you could go around doing things without the interruptions common during the normal waking hours.  After that, I started to push the envelope--trying to sleep as little as possible. At one point I was down to about 4.5 hours a night. This, not coincidentally, was also the time I discovered naps.  Since then, I have become an ardent napper. I take a nap every day, usually for ten to fifteen minutes (but, if I haven't slept much, I may nap for an hour if I can spare the time). The effect is amazing. After a nap, I am happy, productive, and enjoy what I'm doing. If I don't get a nap, the afternoon and evening are--literally--painful to me. I can't concentrate, can't stay awake, don't want to be around people, am impossible to talk to, and can't function without acting out fits more commonly seen among kindergarteners. If I am having lunch at work, I always close my door after eating to take a quick ten minute nap. I have a couch in my office for just this reason.  However, if given the choice, I'd probably would abandon naps and go to the sleeping system favored by Thomas Edison--sleep three to four hours overnight, then  another three to four hours during the day. That would be pure Nirvana for me.

      As I age, I remember less and less. Its not a short/long term memory thing, either. I just can't remember anything. As a result, every year I "keep track" of more and more things.  It started off in 2000, when I decided to keep a list of every book I read, in chronological order. Now, in 2004, I keep similar lists for movies I watch and music I buy, again, in chronological order.  It starts off with the best of intentions. I make a "Top Ten" list for CDs every year, and every December I have trouble keeping track of everything I've bought and/or listened to in the previous twelve months. As a result, I always end up forgetting to include at least one CD that I really loved, but assumed was from the previous year. I always say I'll keep a list. Now, I do.  Movies are another thing. I consider myself to have pretty good taste in a lot of different elements of culture--except movies. I love movies. I love most movies. So, I'll watch just about anything--and usually like it. I'll walk out of seeing something like  Shallow Hal  or  The Majestic  and proclaim to my movie companion how great/funny/moving/engaging/insightful/challenging it was. Since I am so easy to please, I see a ton of movies. That, coupled with the fact I'm so dense I can't even remember my parents' names, when someone asks if I've seen a movie, I often can't remember. They'll describe the plot and I can't remember. Sometimes I've even rented movies, watched fifteen minutes of it, then suddenly realized I saw it in the theater six months ago.  Thus, now, I keep a list to help recall what I've seen.  When Miss Kitten heard of this latest list addition, she had a look of horror on her face. I think she is constantly worried that I am one chronicled list or unique habit away from becoming Ted Kacynski or one of those guys you see on the news who keeps a detailed diary of everything they do and weighs (then chronicles) everything the eat.  Of course I think that will never happen, but I have to admit, it isn't an irrational fear. It isn't like I'm going to make  fewer  lists each year. And if the list-making thing works out, wouldn't it be logical that I'd try a few more?  However, when I start making lists of my lists--then we have a problem.

      Perhaps I should just hibernate.  I've been straining to think of something to write here for three days, but nada. There just hasn't been anything of note going on.  If you ever want a taste of what post-nuclear, apocalyptic despair will look like--try early January in Ohio. It's 8 degrees outside (wind chill is -15) and you rarely see other people out and about. In other words, nothing is happening. Its a weird time of year for culture, too--no new books come out, no new music, no live performances. Normal life just kind of stops for a few weeks. Everyone is in an after-the-holidays funk.   Including me.  Go find your hilarities and mindless entertainment elsewhere.

      To make up for last year's underwhelming "books read" count--I've started the new year off with a bang (this isn't the result of a new year resolution, honest). So far, I've finished two books.   Read this weekend:   urlLink  The Da Vinci Code   by Dan Brown. Usually when books top the best seller lists, I take that as a general sign to  avoid  those books. However, people kept raving about this book, I'd received a Barnes and Noble gift card for Christmas that was burning a hole in my pocket, so I thought I'd give it a shot. The book moves really fast; I read the whole thing in less than two days. Overall, I'd give it a B-. The story is amazing, but nothing original. The whole secret society/history of Christianity thing has been written about extensively. Rather than add anything new to the legends and theories, Brown just basically uses the work of others as the background for his thriller. Moving beyond the backstory, the characters are pretty one-dimensional, the story takes a couple difficult-to-shallow turns, and it is a pretty stereotypical thriller. I figured out who "The Teacher" was about two pages after the character was introduced (and about 300 pages before Brown confirms). All this said, I still couldn't put it down.   Current read:   urlLink  Scoop   by Evelyn Waugh. I'm trying to get back on track with my quest to read or re-read all 100 of the Modern Library Board's list of the top 100 novels of the 20th century (again, its just coincidence that I'm doing this at the new year--no resolution, honest).

      For the past three years now I've kept a yearly list of every book I've read, in order. 2003 was a bad year for me and books. Outside if a few highlights, there weren't many stellar books, and I didn't read that many. That may be due to my recent interest in magazines. I use frequent flier miles (and a small amount of cash) to subscribe to over a dozen different publications (most of which I read every issue). I figure that even if I end up spending $40-$50 a year on magazine subscriptions, I'm still way ahead than if I bought a fractional number at newsstands.  That's all relative, though, because--even in a slow year--I read way more books than most people. In 2001, I read 40 books; in 2002 I read 28. This year I read 24. My goal always has been to read 50 books in a year. We'll see if I ever get there.  Here is what I read this year, in order:      urlLink  All My Life For Sale   by John D. Freyer   urlLink  The Sound and The Fury   by William Falkner   urlLink  Niagara Falls All Over Ag ain  by Elizabeth McCracken   urlLink  The New H.N.I.C.   by Todd Boyd   urlLink  What Liberal Media?   by Eric Alterman   urlLink  Legends of Long Beach Island   by David Siebold and Charles Adams III   urlLink  Stiff   by Mary Roach   urlLink  A Million Little Pieces   by James Frey   urlLink  Reefer Madness   by Eric Schlosser   urlLink  The Lady Is A Vamp   by Tempest Storm with Bill Boyd   urlLink  God's Secretaries   by Adam Nicolson   urlLink  Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs   by Chuck Klosterman   urlLink  Candy and Me: A Love Story   by Hilary Lifton   urlLink  Invisible Front ier  by L. B. Deyo & David �Lefty� Leibowitz   urlLink  Naked in Baghdad   by Anne Garrels   urlLink  Diary: A Novel   by Chuck Palahniuk   urlLink  Are We Not Men? We Are Devo   by Jade Dellinger and David Giffels   urlLink  The Red Badge of Courage   by Stephen Crane   urlLink  War is a Force That Gives Us Meaning   by Chris Hedges   urlLink  Never Mind The Pollacks   by Neal Pollack   urlLink  The Golden Age of Roller Coasters   by David W. and Diane DeMali Francis   urlLink  Middlesex   by Jeffrey Eugenides   urlLink  Songbook   by Nick Hornby   urlLink  Hardcore Zen   by Brad Warner

      If I see one more pennyante motherfucker on TV or in a newspaper this weekend, claiming their wrinkly sixty-something ass is only sixteen-years-old because they were born on February 29th (and usually follows the comment with something like, "...and you know, I feel young, too!"), I'm going to shoot somebody.  No wonder they only let this happen every four years. Enough! Get back in your cave.

      I knew my latest obsession had grown out of control when one of my co-workers discretely pulled me aside for a private conversation. She told me that, though she generally didn't spend much time looking at my butt, seeing my lime green boxer shorts peeking out from the hole on the back of my jeans kept drawing her attention. It was an image she�d rather not experience again. "Buy some new pants," she suggested.  I'd been resisting such a purchase for a few weeks. It wasn't that I didn't care; perhaps it was that I cared too much.  My confliction began when I read in the paper that Levi's was closing its last factory in the US. I have always been a habitual Levi's wearer, but figured that I could make a statement by buying another brand of jeans that was still manufactured in America.  Now, I'm not some zealot about "Buy American" by any standard, but like many people, I am really disturbed by what is happening to our country' jobs. American backbone was built on upon the puritan work ethic: work hard and good things would follow. Even though everyone can't be a millionaire, it has always been possible to provide for your family, and move forward towards your dreams, while working a basic blue-collar job. Now, it's difficult for a family to make ends meet when  both  partners in a family are working blue-collar jobs. It just defies logic how that in America, the richest country in the world, you can work a full-time job, yet not earn enough to cover your basic needs, let alone save money for the future or emergencies.  Therefore, I felt that I'd reward a company still manufacturing jeans in this country (and hopefully paying a decent wage to its workers), by paying whatever their price was for American-made jeans. Then I started doing some digging online. There are a litany of web sites that not only document what products are, and aren't, made in the USA, but also offer information on what companies are using sweatshops, pay sub-standard wages, or have a track record of abusing or endangering their workers.  I was shocked by what I read.  Basically, no major manufacturer makes jeans in the US. In fact, outside of rugged work clothes, it's hard to find  any  major clothing maker that still manufactures clothes in the US. This was driven home by a trip to the mall. I went from store to store, looking at the labels on clothes. Everything, and I mean without-a-single-exception-everything, was made overseas.  It felt really creepy. How did this happen? How did I not notice? I felt like someone who goes to the doctor with an achy knee and comes home with a diagnosis of cancer that has spread throughout my body, leaving me a few months to live.  I'd love to do something about this, but without  any  choices, what am I supposed to do?  Call me crazy, or maybe even a socialist anti-free trade radical, but I would have no problem paying an extra few bucks for a pair of jeans in exchange for knowing that one of my fellow countrymen wasn't going to lose their job as a result. Judging from what I saw at the mall, and whenever I read about the continued dominance of Wal-Mart, I'm obviously not in the majority.

      I've been writing a series of autobiographical stories centered around the correlations between my life and fourteen obscure songs from the 1980s. A few exerpts have appeared in various publlications since last fall. Several have appeared in  urlLink M-80 , a 'zine I write for.  The problem is that some of the stories are too large for the magazine. We came up with  novel solution--publish the large ones as chapbooks that'll be inserted into the magazine.  Next month M-80 will publish a story of mine called "Blue Monday" about the parallels between my life and the New Order classic.  You can  urlLink click here  to bring up the story as a .pdf file.  It's an interesting read. Enjoy.

      Last night a group of friends and I went out for dinner and cocktails. While the conversation topics ebbed and flowed throughout the evening, when we were actually eating, we got off on an interesting tangent: things that our families' dogs had done.    One friend has a dog that loved to eat money. One time the pooch ate a one-hundred dollar bill.  Another had a dog that ate the crotch out of all her underwear.  Another friend had a dog that was expelled from obedience school.  One friend had a dog that stole her training bras and would run around the house with them hanging out of it's mouth, bra flapping behind like a flag.  Another pet used to dig used tissues out of the trash can and eat them.  My childhood dog loved to eat cat poop, straight out of the litterbox.   None of us thought anything of this conversation until I looked over at the woman at the next table who had dropped her fork on her plate then and shot me the evil eye when I described how kitty litter would spray everywhere while my dachshund dug with her snout in search of treats.  Guess it didn't go well with her foie gras.

      From the March 1st issue of   urlLink The Nation  :  Things that George Bush could do with the $200 million he's raising for this fall's election:    Purchase 108 ads during the Super Bowl.  Pay the salaries for the entire New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox baseball teams.  Provide body armor for 166,666 soldiers stationed in Iraq (who currently don't have them).  Compensate 20,000 Enron workers for their lost retirement savings.  Remove the 23 million landmines in Egypt (left over from WWII).  Reinstate the cuts in his budget for protective gear for firefighters.  Pay-off 10,455 people's share of the national debt.  Buy 12 million pheasants for Dick Cheney to shoot.  Rent 3.3 million tuxedos--enough for the entire state of Oklahoma.  Sponsor two dozen Nascar teams.  The amount Bush is bringing in for the 2004 election is larger than what Ronald Reagan, Bush Sr, and Bob Dole raised for all their presidential bids--combined.  Remember, if you don't vote--ignorant, evil fuckheads like Bush win elections.

      Several new discs:    urlLink She's In Control   by Chromeo. Sounds like a rev'd-up modern day Cameo, mixed with a dash of Grand Master Flash, electronica, and Black Eyed Peas. It's awesome. Almost guaranteed a spot on my ten best list for 2004. You can listen to it on their  urlLink label's web site .   One of my favorite bands, Lambchop, released two CDs today,   urlLink Aw, C'Mon   and   urlLink No, You C'Mon  . There own record label calls Lambchop "the most fucked up country band in Nashville." If you've heard their last few albums, you know they've taken some extensive and bizarre steps away from their down-tempo country roots. Now, the band (13 members in its current configuration--only one guy has been on all their albums) sounds like minimalist Burt Bacharach. I've listened to them each several times and I have no idea why they released these as two separate discs (outside of the fact that it wouldn't all fit on one). They are not thematically different, nor do they contain different types of songs. It's kind of like Guns N' Roses  Use Your Illusion I  &  II  (both released on the same day, Prince, Bruce Springsteen, and Tom Waits have also done this trick)--just a whole lot of Lambchop.

       Current read:    urlLink Meat Is Murder   by Joe Pernice. What a great idea.  urlLink Continuum Books  has created a book series called " urlLink 33 1/3 ." The collection consists of small, short volumes, written mostly by music journalists and musicians, about classic albums. Sometimes the books tell the story behind the making of the album, sometimes they are about the album's impact on culture, other times the books deal with the author's own relationsip with the album, etc... Pernice's  urlLink Meat Is Murder   (focused around the Smiths album of that name) is rather unusual --it's fiction. The book tells the story of a small town near Boston where the protagonist discovers the album  Meat Is Murder  around the same time several acquaintences die, he falls in love, and he tries to start a rock band. It's pretty wicked fun stuff.

      While I have an adventurous spirit, I am a creature of habit. I tend to order certain items at specific restaurants ("Oh, we are going to Bob Evans--good, I'm in the mood for pancakes"), only buy certain items at certain stores (I still purchase my Levis at Sears--which features neither then best selection or better price, but I've  always  purchased my Levis at Sears since I was a kid), and have a lot of ritualistic habits that annoy my family and friends.  Part of it is because I tend to stick with things I like, and part of the reason is because I find most decisions to be distracting.  I recently ran across a web site that should appeal to these instincts, called  urlLink whattorent.com . The site offers to help you pick out movies to rent. A nice, but somewhat creepy concept. You fill out a personality screener along with some specific movie-related questions, tell it what mood your in, and bang--it recommends a movie for you.  It's fun to do, you should try it.  However, the real fun comes when you back up, create a different profile, and input crazy stuff into the personality profile. I created a profile called "Boogieman" and gave the weirdest, most disconnected answers I could--just to see what it would do.  The site recommended two movies to Boogieman-- Kindergarten Cop  and  Cocoon . There is deep context in their somewhere, I'm sure of it.

On a few occasions, I've written and produced stories about ephemeral film--the type of social engineering films shown in classrooms in the 1950s to 1970s. One of the experts in the field is a guy named Skip Elsheimer. Here is  urlLink an article  he's written about a film Disney produced in 1973 about venereal disease. Typically funny.

      I read a review of a new band called Chromeo that caught my attention--they're described as a mixture of hip-hop, Cameo-style funk, and electronic dance music. After some hunting, I found out the record comes out February 17th. However, their record company has a  urlLink page about the album , including the ability to hear a stream of the entire album online now. It's pretty awesome--I'd recommend a visit.

      Whatever you do, don't click on  urlLink this link . Or  urlLink this one . Not even  urlLink this one .  Don't even think about it.  Last weekend Miss Kitten meowed about how I never link to her newly redesigned  urlLink web site , even though she has me linked (and named) on hers.  So, on Sunday, I posted an entry with a link to  urlLink her web site .  How thoughtless of me.  What was I thinking?  After learning I had done this, Miss Kitten was mortified.  "But  urlLink the web site  isn't ready yet!"  "You told me to link to it," I reasoned.  "Yes, but I didn't mean right away. It isn't completed, there are sections missing, and somethings don't work right. People will visit it and think I have no idea what I'm doing!"   **   I guess, somehow, I was supposed to know that.  So, whatever you do, don't visit  urlLink her site .  Not until she's ready. I guess we'll--somehow--know when that is, as well.   ** = Miss Kitten is a professional web architect and regularly teaches college courses on web design.

      Seems I've got a theme going--non-fiction books with "American" in the titles, written by men named David (which, coincidentally, is my middle name).   Just finished but forgot to mention:    urlLink Absolutely American   by David Lipsky. The author follows a group of cadets through their four years at West Point. Its a fascinating look at a very unusual way to attend college and find your place in the world. Great stuff.   About 1/3 finished with:    urlLink American Sucker   by David Denby. The author went through a divorce in 2000 and wanted to buy out his wife's share of their NYC apartment. So he took his life savings and "gambled" it in the stock market, right at the time of the big collapse, and lost everything. A sad, but fascinating tale. That said, I'm part way through it and am already thinking I've heard all this guy has to say. We'll see how it ends up.

      Last night I took the first of my new fencing classes. Long time readers may recall that last year (before the holidays) I took an adult and children's fencing class at which I was the only adult (my 11 classmates ranged in age from 7-13).  Unfortunately, this class is all adults, and I am now the second youngest. Fencing with adults feels a lot more normal and evenly matched, but there is one element of fencing with adults I hadn't anticipated.  Boobs.  If you've never fenced before, the sensation of being hit with a sword is a bit different than you'd expect. The sword has a rubber end on it and you are wearing padding. In the end, a sword hit feels like someone poking you with their finger. That told, I don't know many women who enjoy being poked in the breast with a finger, nor any guy who wants a class full of people to watch him nail some woman there.  As a result, I was obsessed with  not  hitting my female opponents' boobs. As a result, I'd strike them in the stomach and more often, in the upper chest and collarbone area (where you  really  feel it). While it is a "legal" strike to hit a woman's breast, it just seems too weird.  As a result, some of my practice strikes were a mess. It's like a force of nature. The chest is the natural aiming point. But as you approach, you veer off to the top of bottom as if magnetically impelled to do so. One time I was so anti-aiming for a woman's chest that I popped her in the throat.  I managed to get through class with making an ass out of myself, but it was close. The instructor does provide "breast plates" for lady fencers. Last night, none of them wore one. Hopefully, next time they will.

Well, my girlfriend of eight years, who I refer to as Miss Kitten, recently asked why I don't ever link to  her  web site. I mentioned the above--she told me she didn't really care.  So, if you are curious,  urlLink here is her web site .

      If you read the first half of "Liquid Gold Resurrector" and are looking for the second half--I amended it to the original posting.  If you have no idea what the fuck I'm talking about, I originally posted the story's first half with a note saying it was "part one" and that "part two" would be forthcoming in a few days. Once I finished it, it didn't seem like two separate stories, so I reedited the original post with the entire, unsegmented story.  Make sense?

      Well, at least my favoite now. Its a distinction similar to who is your favorite contestant on American Idol. A distinction which really means nothing and will change over time, but at the moment it feels somewhat significant. Kinda.  The album is Iron and Wine's   urlLink Our Endless Numbered Days  . If you did a DNA cloning experiment, mixing genes from John Martyn, Nick Drake, and Tom Waits--this guy (yes, Iron and Wine is a one-man band) is what you'd get.

I'm doing good, but currently am a book and a half behind.  Here is my latest:   urlLink Wigfield  , by Amy Sedaris (sister of David), Steven Colbert (of   urlLink The Daily Show  ), and another guy.

       New from iTunes:  Blockhead's   urlLink Music by Candlelight   - instrumental hip-hop, funky yet ultra-smooth. Incredibly cool for those interested in something fresh, yet chilled (and aren't interested in updated New Age music).   Reading:    urlLink The Radioative Boy Scout   by Ken Silverstein. The subject is what the title implies: a kid who builds a nuclear reactor in his mother's shed for a merit badge. Originally an article in Harpers--and it feels like it: short, lots of filler, and unnecessary ancillary material.

      Man, I hate it when this happens. I bought two new CDs this week. both from bands who'd previously released great records. I bought both sight unseen (or would that be ear unheard), and both suck and blow at the same time. Even though both were on sale, I feel like quite a fool for spending money on something that I'll never listen to again. Can you say "Listed used on Amazon"?  They are: The Vines'   urlLink Winning Days   and The Cooper Temple Clause's   urlLink Kick Up The Fire and Let The Flames Break Loose  .

      We weren't rich, just busy.  That's the phrase I've always used to preface any discussion of my family's housecleaner, Sherrie. Sherrie came into our lives shortly after my mother began working as a high school principal, my father began a 45-minute commute to work each day, and my brother and I, now in our early teens, were participating in just about any activity that would have us--simply to stay as far away from home as possible. For the most part, Sherrie was a force in our lives rarely seen, just an unknown person who came each Thursday to clean up our messes. Given the informal nature of this relationship, you can imagine my surprise when I learned that our housecleaner Sherrie brought our family's dachshund back from the dead.  Outside of the whole dead dog business, Sherrie's visits to our house were fairly uneventful. She'd dust the furniture, vacuum the carpets, clean the toilets, mop the floors, and coat the entire house in Liquid Gold. For the uninformed, Liquid Gold is a rather unassuming furniture polish, but to Sherrie, it was the mark of a job well done. She liberally applied it to every wood and wood-like surface in the entire house. Leaving a sharp sheen over every surface, looking as if the entire house had been coated in a deep shellac. At certain times of day, when the angle of sun the sun just right, the effects could be blinding. "The Liquid Golds spells clean," Sherrie would always shout, and mean it.  To us, Sherrie was a lot like Santa Claus. Each week we'd busily straighten up the house to prepare for Sherrie's arrival. My mother would leave Sherrie a note with any special requests accompanied by two crisp twenties. Almost magically, when we returned home from school, Sherrie had visited, making everything in the house slippery and shiny.  The whole relationship had kind of a sweet tone to it, before I actually met Sherrie (she always came during the day while we were gone), I imagined her as somebody's silver-haired grandmother, who cleaned houses because she liked to help people and made the world a little bit better with each bottle of Liquid Gold.  Sherrie was a little different than my original expectation. Despite her regular presence in our home, I didn't met her until I graduated from high school and began commuting to college from home. Since my budding social and drinking schedule kept me out late most every night, my Thursdays usually began with the Sherrie's midday arrival. She'd announce her presence by inserting a favorite tape into my parents' cheap little stereo, cranking out every decibel it could muster. Bruce Springsteen's  Born in the U.S.A.  was a perennial favorite, though Bob Seger was also brought along for longer visits.  Sherrie would hold an ongoing competition between herself and the stereo as to who could be louder. She'd sing along with her favorite songs in a flat, piercing monotone completely devoid of melody or dynamic range, sounding much like a very loud version of Bob Dylan on helium.  Sherrie was fighting a desperate battle with her age. Probably in her late 40s or early 50s, Sherrie surrounded herself with the trappings of a young woman. She'd wear painfully tight jeans, along with neon-colored tee shirts containing pithy slogans like "I'm with Stupid" featuring an arrow pointing off into our dining room. She regularly dyed her hair jet black--more like a blackhole-ish void of any color rather than any particular tone or hue. She'd coat it with hairspray, then tease it into strange clumpy masses that seemed to take on an entirely different shape when viewed from different angles.  When I would muster the initiative to get out of bed and come downstairs for some breakfast, Sherrie would usually attempt to engage me in conversation. Sherrie had a habit of punctuating everything she said with this bizarre smile. It was similar to those head-half-bent poses often seen in high school year books, coupled with the wide-eyed, open-mouth stare of terror seen on Godzilla just before he scorched half of Tokyo with his fiery breath. Sherrie seemed only capable of addressing you if she stood ten inches from your face, looked you straight in the eye, and yelled a short, quick sentence as loud as she could. "Tells your Momma that I needs to take next week off," she'd yell, followed by that head-cocked smile, "I'm going to the track with my sister!! Gonna wins it all!! Then I ain't never cleanin' no houses again!!" Then that smile thing again.  In Sherrie's world, everything was plural and she threw around direct articles with reckless abandon, like they were going out of style. "Tells your Momma that she need more of the Liquid Golds from the K-Marts!!" (Followed by a smile.)  One morning, having awoken excruciatingly early for a meeting with a professor, I came home to find Sherrie had recently arrived. That morning's cleaning was accompanied by Journey's  Greatest Hits , which I could hear from halfway down the driveway.  As I entered the house, Sherrie was in the kitchen, running towards me. She grabbed my arms and placed her face a mire three inches from mine.  "I raised the dog from the dead!! I raised the dog from the dead!!" she cried. "She was gone!! Headed for the light!! But I brought her back!! Look at her!! She fine!! I raised the dog from the dead!!"  The dog in question was our "hot dog," Gretchen. While most people find dachshunds incredibly cute and endearing, Gretchen kind of fell into a different category. In fact, Gretchen was quite a foul animal.  Gretchen spent most of her time sleeping. When asleep, Gretchen had an incredibly loud snore. Her restful slumber was often interrupted by a family member moving her into another room so we could have a conversation, hear the television, or simply enjoy some peace and quiet. During the precious few hours that Gretchen spent awake, she spent most of her time walking around the house hacking and snorting, often gleefully re-consuming anything she happened to regurgitate. Her entire body was covered in oily sacks, causing her fur to look lumpy and ill-fitting, as if it had been left in a dryer too long and had become wrinkled and misshapen.  To make matters worse, Gretchen was plagued by terrible gas, which would often plague whomever was in her presence within ten to fifteen minutes of her arrival. Her attacks of flatulence were accompanied by such loud reports that they often frightened her, sending her running from the room as if shot from a canon.  Most disturbing of all was Gretchen's relationship with fecal matter. Not only did she take great joy in rolling around in any dog's bodily waste, including her own, but she often would sneak down to the basement for a snack of cat turds. Gretchen would raid the litter box with such regularity that we eventually took up the matter with our vet. After shared our embarrassing story with him, he counseled us to loosen up. "Relax," he said in his slow New England drawl, "Cat poop is like chocolate to dogs. They love it. Just leave her alone, it doesn't hurt anybody."  So here I am, in my parents' kitchen, Sherrie starring into my eyes, and a dachshund recently returned from the great beyond.  From the look on Sherrie's face, she didn't quite know what to do next. After the excitement of sharing the news of her miracle, she just stood there, waiting for me to some kind of reaction: cry, hug her, exclaim a "Hallelujah," or something. In absence of any other discernable course of action, she simply cocked her head to the side, and smiled wide. As soon as things started to sink in, I looked over at Gretchen who stood in the corner gleefully eating something of unknown origin.  After a few more uncomfortable moments, the situation boiled down to Sherrie and I staring at each other, not quite sure what to do.  "Thank you?" I muttered, more as a question than a declarative statement.  "Oh, yous welcome sweetie."  And with that, Sherrie hugged me.  And kept hugging me.  Very tightly.  For a very long time.  Then let me go to wipe the tear away from her eye.  Later that night, my family came home and I kept mum about Gretchen and her near death experience. During dinner, my family made the usual round of polite conversation about what went on during the day and assorted other patter. I had been quiet until my mother asked me what had happened during my day.  "Oh, not much...turned in my history paper...the neighbors are having a garage sale next month...Gretchen died and came back from the dead." I think my "ho-hum" demeanor threw them off.  "Wait a minute," my father said. "Did you say the dog died today?"  "Yes, I did�I mean she did�die that is."  Then I casually scooped another form full of peas into my mouth.  "The dog isn't dead," he replied. "She's laying over there."  Then my father's eyes grew large, realizing that Gretchen hadn't moved from the corner of the room since he arrived home.  "But Sherrie was here and brought her back from the dead."  "How can you tell?" my brother chimed in.  As my parents put down their utensils and started asking questions, I ran through the whole story for them. They, like me earlier, had no idea what to do or make of it.  My mother, who had lost her mother a year earlier, was particularly concerned and wondered if Gretchen should go to the vet or some kind of diggie emergency room. We eventually calmed her down, my brother rationalizing that if Gretchen could manage to find her way back from death once, even she could manage to retrace her steps if she passed away again.  The next morning we made a visit to the doctor and my mother had me explain the incident to the vet. After examining her, he told us that Gretchen probably had not died. He theorized that one of three things had probably happened. First was a stroke, and she showed no sign of having a stroke. Second, she could have choked on something and passed out. Third was that she had a seizure. In any regard, Sherrie's panicked shaking probably helped revive her and probably had indeed saved her life. While serious, he didn't think it was a cause for alarm. This advice, of course, was coming from a man who, several months ago, had encouraged us to let Gretchen eat as much cat poop as she wanted.  While the vet was reassuring us that Gretchen had, indeed, not died, the dog was sitting on the examine table in between us and the doctor. As the conversation ended, Gretchen rolled into a ball, dug her nose into her rear end, and softly grunted as she slowly licked herself.  My parents wrote a nice note to Sherrie thanking her for helping the dog. They made only vague reference to the whole possible death/resurrection thing, but expressed their gratitude nonetheless.  Sherrie kept working for my family for another few years, but eventually wrote a note to my parents saying she was going to retire, adding that while she appreciated the business, she would now "gets to hang out with my grandbabies all I likes!"  Gretchen didn't last much longer than Sherrie. Her mild (though disgusting) health concerns grew into serious health concerns. She developed arthritis, lost a lot of her sight, and suffered a few more seizure/stroke episodes--each leaving her a little weaker than before. By this time, my brother and I had both moved away. It seemed that without the two of us to hang out with and monitor, Gretchen had lost her sense of purpose. She just slept. Around the time my father had to pick her up to move her around, they made the tough decision to have her put to sleep.  Whenever I tell this story, I'm always stuck for a closer. There was no big dramatic ending or life lesson learned. If the event inspired anything in me since, it's a better understanding of Sherrie. When I'd share this story with friends, I'd always focus on how stupid I thought Sherrie was for convincing herself that she had miraculously brought our family pet back from heaven's door (which just demonstrated how stupid I was for thinking so). In the past several years, I see it differently. Sherrie's pride wasn�t vanity at her apparent ability to control life and death, but in her connection to us.  Here's a woman who spent every Thursday, for years, cleaning up after us. She saw how we lived: our photographs on the walls, our Christmas trees, what we read, our (questionable) taste in furniture and decorating. She experienced these things with us, but our only real connection were the two twenties my mother would put out. Looking back, it has a lot of classist undertones. There is a lot of power exchanged in a relationship like that. It's especially odd considering my family barely had a pot to piss in, let alone one that needed a domestic employee to tend after.  But Sherrie probably had a dog, or a cat, or a hamster, or some animal that she'd miss if it died. She'd have been grateful if someone helped the animal, let alone brought it back from the dead.  On that afternoon, we had a weird, uncomfortable bonding experience. She had done something that she knew had meaning to us; that would be important and significant to us. It was a time when Sherrie and I, briefly, became human to each other.

      I (kinda) have a new book coming out. I wrote a chapter in a new book entitled   urlLink Shoot The Singer   that is coming out in May (the hardcover is, like, $60--put the  urlLink paperback  will be much more reasonable). It is a compilation of writing about music censorship around the world. My chapter is about censorship in the US since September 11th. It is a pretty cool read. For as much as I wish a poor recovery to John Ashcroft, once you finish it, you'll realize that, even today, we have it easy compared to citizens of other countries. Real easy.

      I'm sticking my toe back into the dark, frigid waters of music criticism. I've been asked by  urlLink Scene Magazine  to start reviewing albums, my first is the new Lou Reed live album. The only part that sucks is that I was hoping that I wouldn't have to pan the first album I reviewed. However...  Lou Reed  Animal Serenade  (Reprise)  After almost forty years, Lou Reed still can't decide if he wants to be a rock star or an art star. His music has always relied on his status as an "artist"; his art leans heavily on his cred as a musician. The downside of this conflict is well-documented in this two-hour live concert, recorded at LA's Wiltern Theater last June. Though Reed hobbles through some lesser-known material from his early career, most material draws heavily from Reed�s less accessible work (including the John Cale collaboration  Songs For Drella  and 2003�s  The Raven ). Accompanied by long-time collaborator bassist Fernando Saunders, along with a cellist, second guitarist, and back-up vocalist, the album's stripped down arrangements come off as lethargic and uninspired. The between-song banter shows a slightly bitter Reed trying to prop up his own legacy by reminding the crowd of how good he and his band are and the significance of the music they�re performing.  Animal Serenade  offers little more than proof that Reed is now in the twilight of his career. The ferocity, danger, and prowess are gone. Listening leaves you to wonder if this beast has grown long in the tooth, or is simply toothless.  �Eric Nuzum

      ...whatever.   New discs in the disc player:    urlLink The Milk Man   by Deefhoof (weird, poppy, indie music with a Japanese lead singer) and   urlLink Franz Ferdinand   (heralded as "the next big thing"--good, but not  that  good).   Purchased from iTunes with all my winning Diet Pepsi bottle tops:  Carina Round's   urlLink The Disconnection  . Never heard/read anything about her. However, it looked interesting, so I downloaded it from iTunes. Her stuff is like a cross between Sheryl Crow and PJ Harvey. My favorite of the recent releases.

      I saw the best documentary last night. It was so good that I watched it twice. It's called  Off the Charts  ( urlLink Amazon ,  urlLink Netflix ). It is a look into the world of song poems. Perhaps you've seen ads in magazine before that promise to take your lyrics and poems, then turn them into songs (for a fee) and send you a copy of the recording. Sometimes these songs are called "outsider music," which is a bit elitist.  This documentary spends time with the people that write the original lyrics/poems and the businesses that turn them into "songs." The film shows one businessman, the owner of Magic Key Productions, turning some handwritten lyrics into a song--in 48 minutes and 15 seconds from the time he opens the envelope until he records the final track of the song.  It is amazing and freaky and funny. You start off in big-eyed wonder at how weird these people are, but by the end you find them incredibly endearing and likeable.  I really can't say enough good things about it. Definitely worth an hour.

       Currently reading:    urlLink When I Was Cool   by Sam Kashner. When Kashner graduated from high school he anted to be a poet and was obsessed with the Beats, so he talked his parents into letting him enroll in the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics, where the surviving Beats were the faculty. When he arrived, he learned he was the schools only student. I really interesting and fun read.   Currently listening to:  The Stills  urlLink  Logic Will Break Your Heart  . Everyone compares them to Echo and the Bunneymen and Joy Division, but critics compare 3/4 of all the new rock groups around to Echo and the Bunneymen and Joy Division. Decide for yourself.   On the radio:   urlLink The Next Big Thing  from WNYC in New York. It is everything, anything, and nothing--all in one hour.   If it was on the radio, I'd be listening to it:  A pilot show from Minnesota Public Radio called  urlLink Pop Vultures , hosted by a smart, sassy thing named Kate Sullivan. One of the most refreshing and interesting shows I've heard in years. Amazing considering this is still a pilot (though you can listen to the show on line--stick with the later ones, they are the best).

      Ms Kitten often either (a) makes fun of or (b) is terrified by my long list of habits, rules, and ways of doing things. It isn't like I have this strict code that I must always follow (her fear), I just figure that if I've figured out a good system for something, I can just go with that (thus, freeing my mind for other things). Some come off as complete nonsense, but believe me, they're all grounded in sound, rock hard reasoning and thought.  Take socks and underwear, for example.  Several years ago I stumbled on a system that works well for me, so well, that I have used it religiously ever since.  Checking the status of my socks and underwear seemed like an incredible waste of time for me: discarding pieces that had holes, were torn or thread-bare, etc... So a few years ago, when my sock stockpile was in pretty bad shape, I threw out every single pair I had and bought all new ones. Then, I make an effort to wear them consistently over time. When they start showing signs of wear or tiny holes, I throw the whole lot out and buy all new.  I do this with underwear as well. About once a year I go shopping and buy a pile of underwear, wear them until they've reached the end of their useful life, and then start fresh again.  This system has worked to a near flawless perfection until Ms Kitten started to buy me "cute" underwear for Christmas, my birthday, etc...  Nothing edible, leather, featuring metal hardware or phrases like "Home of the Whopper," just things she'd see (ex. boxers with little cocktail glasses on them) that she liked. Whenever I'd open these presents, my first response, delivered in a dull panic as if I was about to be charged with a crime I did not commit, would be: "Underwear? I'm a good six months away from buying underwear! Why are you buying underwear?"  She'd tell me to loosen up and enjoy my present.  "Enjoy my present?" I'd respond. "But this is going to mess up my entire undergarments system! I've worked for years to perfect my underwear and sock purchases! Am I just supposed to throw all that genius out the window and parade around in these little green boxers?"  Ms Kitten would usually greet my concern with silence, then say that it might not be such a bad idea to throw that genius out the window.  This past Christmas, she bought me no less than four new pairs of underwear--a good eight months into my cycle (part of me now thinks she is out to  deliberately  destroy my underwear and sock M.O.). After some tough negotiations (my initial position is that I would store them until I bought new underwear, then use them), we decided that I could use my new underwear, but hold off on deciding their long-term fate until the older pairs had run their course.  I felt we had come to a strong compromise that maintained the integrity of my system. Ms Kitten walked away looking like she had just endured a three-hour rendition of "Who's On First."  Today, I am enjoying the second pair of my brand new, premium Hanes white crew socks--one of twelve new pairs currently occupying my sock drawer. When I brought them home, Ms Kitten rolled her eyes. Socks always come first, underwear a few months after. She knows what's coming...

      Wow. Being a semi-public figure, I get some weird email. It usually doesn't bother me. Occasionally, I get weird postal mail and phone calls, which do freak me out. However, the great majority of nasty mail comes my way electronically.  This week seems to be a banner one for giving me e-shit. Not that I'm being paranoid, but it almost feels like a concerted, organized effort. Since Monday, I have received harsh missives informing me that:   I suck.   There are two "unforgivable" errors in my book.   It's too bad I don't believe in God (untrue), because I deserve to burn in Hell.   I am arrogant.   If I had any idea what I was talking about, I'd have a radio program like Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity instead of being an ultra-liberal NPR pansy that no one gives a shit about.   If I really believed in free speech, I'd travel 300 miles each way to speak to a high school civics class for free.   I am an asshole (I got this one twice).   And one email that contained only one line: "your a big ass pussy bitch and i hate you."*  All these comments were unsolicited, out of the blue.  Living under a rock gets more enticing every day.    *= I actually responded to this one, which read: "I think you meant "you're" instead of "your." Love, the Big Ass Pussy Bitch."

       Currently reading:    urlLink The Vampire Lectures   by Laurence Rickels. Based upon a college course he taught at UC Santa Barbara. While it is, at times, an overly verbose and weighty read, it has a lot to offer. It examines the concept of vampire mythology through the lens of psychology--hard core Freudian stuff. In addition to the whole Oedipus-complex, loss of female virtue, son-replacing-father stuff, Rickels makes some interesting observations about other oddball parallels between vampire lore and fear of technology, among other things. It is very interesting, but you get the point about half way through.

      I have always attracted freaks. Whenever there are some oddballs, geeks, or eccentrics in a room, they end up walking over to talk to me. Perhaps it's because I don't tell them to go away or perhaps they think I am one of them. I have never really felt the need to figure out why I have this geek allure--but it's been that way since I was a young kid.  That's why I didn't think it unusual when this kid named Tim started following me around in 10th grade. He was an odd bird. He had this pasty, unwashed look to him, even though he wasn't. His thick glasses were always dirty, he had a perpetual five o'clock shadow (yes, even in 10th grade), tried (unsuccessfully) to pass himself off as a gregarious person, and had a hot temper.  Tim did have one talent, the guy could sing. He had an amazing deep, full voice and always had solos in choir programs as well as big roles in school musicals. He also was very proud of his German heritage--which got a bit weird at times. It wasn't weird because of any identification with Nazism or anything like that, but he'd always come up with these wild stories about spending all of his early childhood in Germany and how much better it was there than the US. Occasionally, Tim would start speaking German. When you'd start looking confused, he'd apologize, claiming that it happened by accident--he said he thinks in German and sometimes it just slips out.  Tim started trying way to hard to be my friend.  After Tim's many uncomfortable attempts at bonding with me, I gave in and started to engage in conversation. We'd talk about a lot of nothing stuff, but it became fairly routine for him to sit next to me in study hall and babble while I pretended to be interested.  One morning, during a school assembly, I asked Tim what was bothering him. He had been mopping around for a day or so, looking so melodramatically upset that I'd deliberately avoided asking what was wrong. During the assembly, I caved and asked what was up. He kept going back and forth on whether to tell me, wondering if I "could handle what was going on." After about a half-hour of annoying hemming and hawing, Tim finally spit it out.  He told me told me that he had been diagnosed with leukemia.  I was floored and didn't know what to say. I ran through the usual litany of questions you'd think to ask someone who had just laid such a bomb on you: expressions of concern, inquiries about treatment or doctor's opinions, and bad motivational pap about "hanging in there" and "if anyone can get through this, it is you." He was really vague about a lot of the details, except to tell me that his doctor was considering some radical treatment that was very experimental.  Over the next few days, he acted very depressed and would occasionally go into coughing fits that would result in the teacher stopping class to look after Tim. He would say he didn't need to go to the nurse, didn't need any attention, he just needed to get a drink of water. Then he'd weakly get up and sulk towards the door. Before he walked out, he'd always look over towards me.  After about a week or so, I was getting curious why Tim was still in school. If he was so ill, shouldn't he be getting some treatment or something? All Tim did was have these coughing fits. Tim did tell me stories in study hall about passing out in the grocery store or feeling faint walking to class, but nothing about what was happening to make him any better. When I finally asked about it, Tim told me that his doctors were still considering this radical treatment, but were concerned about finding the right donor. That was it, no more info.  I gave some more encouragement and support, and then didn't really do anything else, except notice his increasingly sickly behavior.  Another few days passed and Tim kept at it: coughing, grabbing a handrail and looking up as if about to faint, and so on. Whenever this would happen, he'd anticipate my question and bring up the "donor" thing again--now suggesting that he might have to find a donor himself.  By the end of the second week, we were sitting in study hall and I was getting tired of all his cagey responses and vague answers. I was legitimately concerned about him and his well-being, but frustrated why he wouldn't give straight answers. I was under the impression that he was trying to protect me. Over time, I became a little obsessed with learning the straight deal. By then, it went well beyond my concern for his health and had more to do with my desire to prove I could handle the truth. It was a lot less about his health than about me.  After a coughing fit in study hall, I looked him in the eye and told him that if he wanted my support, it was his--but he had to cut out the bullshit. My subtext was easy to read: I'll be your friend through this, but I want the dish.  Tim looked like he was going to cry.  "I'm not sure you can handle this," he said.  "Yes, I can," I responded. "Will you just tell me why you aren't getting any treatment?"  "It's complicated�and it is very personal."  "That's fine, just tell me."  Tim made me swear that I'd never repeat this to anyone, that I wouldn't judge him, and that I'd still be his friend after hearing this. He said he had wanted to tell me about this treatment for a while, but he wasn't sure he wanted to go through with it and definitely didn't want anyone else to know.  After all the explaining, Tim told me about the new radical treatment that would allow his body to absorb antibodies and cells from the "donor." This worked by him taking the "donation" orally, coupled with some pills he'd take beforehand. It might heal him, might not--but it definitely would allow him to build his strength back and have a higher chance of surviving traditional therapy. All he needed was the right donor to make the right donation.  Then Tim told me that what he needed was a donation of semen.  After the words left his lips, they were followed by an onslaught of rapid-fire explanations and caveats. It wasn't like he was asking for a donation from me, he explained, but if I wanted to offer one, he could discuss it with his doctor.  At that point, I should have known this was getting too weird, but I had fought so hard to get to this point, I was too satisfied with the trust placed in me to stop there. It never dawned on me that I was being manipulated. In fact, at that stage, didn't doubt his story at all.  He asked what I thought.  I told him I'd have to think about it.  Then Tim went into another coughing spasm.  After the weekend, Tim caught up with me in the hall and sheepishly exclaimed, "Boy, you probably don�t want to talk to me ever again, do you?"  I told him that I understood he was sick, but I wasn't sure if I could be one of his donors.  He stopped walking and said that if I would consent, we could arrange the donation anyway I wanted to. Tim told me he would insist that I be comfortable and well taken care of if I was to be the donor for his treatment. He said that his doctors were too concerned about his health to go against his wishes. In fact, he suggested, we could arrange to do the donation anywhere I wished. We could even do it here at school if we wanted to.  I told him that I still didn't think I could help him. To be honest, I felt terrible about it. I was so overwhelmed with the idea that someone I knew was dying that I never once thought to ask questions about...well, questions about any part of this.  Then the tables turned. Before, Tim had been demonstrating his sickness, but I was the one pursuing details. Now, Tim was coughing, fainting, et al--and I was the one being pursued for information. All he wanted was a "yes"--everything else could be worked out.  At the end of that week (three weeks since Tim first confessed his illness) he sat next to me in study hall and--within ten seconds of sitting down--asked me how I was doing with my "decision about donation." I turned to Tim and told him that I was not going to be his donor. I was sorry, I told him, but unless his doctor was the one asking, I wasn't interested in ever discussing it again.  "You think I�m making this up?" he asked, a bit heatedly.  "Tim, I don't know if you are sick or not, but I don't want to do it and you need to stop asking me."  "But what am I supposed to do?"  "Find another donor."  At that, he was quiet. I was ready to continue if he pushed. How, I wanted to ask, had it been determined that I was a proper donor, especially considering that being a matched donor was such a rare thing? And why, if his health was in such dire straights, wasn't his grimy ass in the hospital?  He started to cry, then started to cough, then ran out into the hallway.  Believe it or not, I felt guilty. I had lived through three weeks of this outlandishness with nothing other than his sick spells, not even missing class for a doctor's appointment, to collaborate this story. Yet I was the one who felt bad about saying "no." What if he really was sick? What if he needed help or was screwed up in the head? Instead of suggesting he see someone, I just treated him like everyone else did--like a social leper.  After he ran out of the room, I only spoke to Tim one other time. A few months later, still in school (and somehow miraculously cured of his coughing and fainting), he came up to me and asked if I was going to come to the school musical, in which he played the lead (somehow managing the strength, considering he should have been in the middle of chemo treatments at that point).  "Do I have to jerk off to get a ticket or can I just buy one?" I asked.  Tim bit his lip, exhaled deeply, and walked away.  I saw Tim the summer after we graduated. I was at a party with some friends and Tim showed up. At the time I was trying really hard to hook up with this incredibly hot exchange student from Germany. We were sitting together when Tim walked by. She shuttered visibly. I asked what was wrong.  "That guy, he is creepy," she said. "What a faker."  For obvious reasons, I was really curious what she meant. She told me that on several occasions she'd overheard Tim "speaking German."  "It was all, how you say�gibberish," she said. "All made up. He is a faker with his German."  After that, I never saw or heard of him again.  The strangest part of all this is, for years, it never dawned on me that Tim might be gay, or at least really hoping to experiment with his sexuality. I just thought he was liar. I really never took it further than that.  When I started writing this, I became very curious about what might of happened to him, so I Googled him. Unfortunately, Tim has a very common last name, so tons of results came up, even when I added our hometown.  My stomach sank to the floor when I read the first search result, about a guy with that name who had recently been arrested for child molestation. In the amount of time it took me to move the mouse over the link and click, I had convinced myself that I was to blame--that if I hadn't blown this incident off to youthful experimentation gone bad, I might have prevented a child from being harmed.   It wasn't him, it was another guy named Tim. It was just a bad search match. Actually, it was pretty stupid for me to jump to that conclusion. He may have been a liar, he may have been sexually confused, but that's a long way from hurting a kid.  I clicked through a few dozen more before realizing that whatever became of Tim, it didn't qualify for inclusion on a web page.  That's probably for the best.

      I am absolutely head over heels in love with the  urlLink new Loretta Lynn album .  It is fascinating for several reasons. First, it is interesting to hear how hipster minimalist Jack White handles a full band (and a country band at that).  Secondly, Loretta Lynn is amazing (and sounds even better), especially considering that she just turned 70.  Lastly, I think it is interesting that an artist that has released more than 70 albums and has never taken a break in her career is, in the eyes of the press, staging a "come back." It's ridiculous.  Let's face it. The only reason Jack White produced this album, the only reason it is being released by Interscope, the only reason it will win a slew of awards, and the only reason it will sell zillions of copies is because Loretta Lynn  has been tapped as this year's "re-discovery"--the same territory plowed over the past few years by Roy Orbison, Johnny Cash, Ralph Stanley, and at least four times by Bob Dylan.  Loretta is the backwoods O.G., and unapologetically so. It is simple, much less polished than she'd like to think it is (she's even wearing an ugly ass prom dress on the cover), and endearing. She has always been the insiders outsider. In that regard, this album doesn't change a thing.  However, it rocks. Totally rocks.

There is a bunch of stuff going on that occupying my thoughts, I just can't share it with 2,000 people right now. I'm working on a new book idea that--while awesome--isn't ready to share yet. I'm contemplating some professional stuff that, again, I can't discuss.  More on all these as they come, just not now...

      One of our reporters, Michelle Chyatte, and I worked on an audio diary from one of our co-workers that just aired this week (finally, after nine months of work). This co-worker, Marti, has a husband, Billy, who found out this past summer that he needed a kidney transplant. Since they feared that Billy wouldn't live long enough to receive a regular kidney donation, Marti decided to donate one of her kidneys to him.  We asked them to make tape recordings through the entire process and  urlLink the resulting story  is an amazing tale of love and sacrifice.  urlLink Listen to it  and see if you can keep your eyes from tearing, seriously.

      I have this tiny screw and it has been driving me crazy for over a week now.  When I say "tiny screw"--I really mean a tiny screw--about 1/4 to 1/2 inch long and very thin.  I first noticed it when I was pulling my sunglass attachments out of my car's overhead sunglass holder. My glasses have magnets embedded in them, so I can take the dark lens attachments and place them against my glasses--and they stick (without those geeky clips). So, anyhow, I pull these out the other day, and this tiny screw is attached to the magnet end of the dark lens that the lens had picked up somewhere.  I immediately started to obsess about where this little screw had come from. It is about the size and shape of a screw you'd find in the hinge of your glasses, so I immediately checked there--no. Watch? No--my watch uses collapsing pins, not screws. Then I though it must have come loose from the overhead glasses holder--no, all the hinges in there are plastic.  So basically, I have this nice, shiny little screw and absolutely no idea what it previously held together. Now, I make sure to keep it with me pretty much all the time because I'm certain that whatever it's from is crucial to my safety and happiness.  It's as if this tiny screw was holding together my entire car and without it I would be driving down the road and the car would fall into a million pieces, explode, or something similar. Or it belongs to some sort of device that will be rendered useless without it.  So I carry this thing around, waiting for the inevitable revelation about where this screw came from. At least I'll be prepared.

      I woke up this morning and had no voice.  I'm not talking about being a little horse--I can't even make a squeak without feeling like someone is inserting a pin into my vocal cords.  I got a slight cold earlier in the week and ended up with a sore throat. Between Monday night and Wednesday afternoon--my voice started to go. I was practically barking on Thursday and Friday (yes, continuing to talk even though my voice was damaged). Ergo, my voice was destroyed by Saturday.  It is odd to go around the world without being able to talk. It, like so many things, is something that you never appreciate until it is gone. I know that's a trite observation, but it's true. It creeps up in the weirdest moments: trying to laugh at something funny on television and singing along with a favorite CD in the car become unproductive and painful.  There is an upside, at least for everyone around me, I'm silent all the time. Having me in a room with others, and not doing the lion's share of the talking, is rare. If I'm not openly engaged, I'm bored. Notice I didn't say "talking"--I'm a good listener, too. But it is a two-way process. Without one, it's no fun.  It should have been fun for my co-workers, who could bring up ideas without worrying how I'm going to react. "Seize the moment," I squeak at them before silently sitting there.  Two other observations:  * When I whisper, everyone else around me whispers as well. * It feels oddly inappropriate to type when I can't speak. It's almost like I shoud stop communicating at all.  You know you are focusing on simple pleasures when the idea of singing the theme song to "Oklahoma" in the shower is the most statisfying experience you can imagine.

      Last night Ms Kitten and I went to see  urlLink  The Ladykillers   (it wasn't that great, especially for a Coen brothers movie--skip it).  We got there early, so we sat and munched all our popcorn while waiting for the flick to begin. As time went on, I kept noticing that  a lot  of seniors were coming in. Seriously, had they all arrived en masse I would have thought it was a coordinated bus trip. Obviously,  The Ladykillers  has been getting some good word of gum among the older set.  Now, for a group that thrives on the idea of respecting elders...they sure could use a lesson in giving some. Throughout the entire movie, these seniors wouldn't shut the fuck up for anything.  Okay, lots of people (including me) talk during the previews. I'll even give someone a few minutes into the film to get settled. But these golden oldies talked constantly throughout the whole movie.  Two things made this especially unbearable. First, they are all hard of hearing, so they speak full voice. The guy at the concession stand probably understood every word that Floyd was trying to share with Edna --who was sitting five inches from his wrinkled lips . Secondly, if you are going to talk during a movie, especially at a decibel level that intrudes on everyone's experience--at least have something interesting to say. In the middle of one quiet scene, I heard Fern, six rows back, call out, "Hey, doesn't your sister have a vase like that?" Or, following a explosion in a dirt tunnel, good ol' Herb took one look at the characters and said, "Look, they're covered in dirt!" No shit, Herb.  For a group that hates that loud rock music and the vulgar, pumping hippity hop music--they could try the tactic of leading by example.

      Latest read:   urlLink Rats: Observations on the History and Habitat of the City's Most Unwanted Inhabitants   by Robert Sullivan. For a year this dude sat on a corner observing the rat population in an obscure alley in downtown Manhattan.   Fucked up things you'll learn about rats if you read this book:   Male rats can have sex up to 20 times a day (and often try to). Female rats can have a litter every 21 days and can immediately become pregnant again. A pair of rats has the potential of having 15,000 descendents within a year. Brown rats (which can be brown or gray in color) can bite up to six times a second, exerting 7,000 pounds per square inch. The rat's teeth are as strong as steel and can gnaw through cement and iron. City rats weigh 40 percent more than rural rats and grow twice as fast, reaching a maximum of 20 inches and two pounds. During the late 1800s, rat/dog fights were a popular pastime in New York. The record was held by a dog named Jack, who killed 100 rats in five minutes and 40 seconds. Despite government efforts to shut down the rat fighting rings, they remained until another popular pastime stole people's attention--baseball. Because they have a collapsible skeletal structure, a rat can squeeze through roles the size of a quarter.

      This past week marks the first anniversary of this blog. While I've always been a copious writer, I never posted much that didn't appear in newspapers, magazines, or on the radio. When I first started, I wondered how long it would be ran out of things to say. Much to my surprise, and no surprise to those who know me, I haven't hit that point yet.  I've posted more than 200 stories, observations, reviews, etc... and more than 400 people read this blog each week. Not bad.  However, of all the stuff I've posted here--deep stuff, insightful missives, and mildly humorous ramblings--what has been the most popular item I've posted here?  This picture of my cat masturbating:       I'm not kidding. Somehow this picture got listed in the image section of Google under "cat porn" and "kitty porn." As a result, about five to ten people  a day  download this picture.  The picture was originally posted as part of  urlLink this story  from last April.  I don't even want to know what people do with it. Come to think of it, I don't want to know what people do with anything they see or read on this site.  Happy anniversary. Come back often...I'll be here.

      When I was younger, I thought Bob Dylan was a pompous dick. He represented everything that my little punk snotty-nose self hated: hippies, old music, acoustic softness, and worst of all--my parents liked him. Oh, foolish little Eric, how unwise I was.  Since then, Dylan, to me, has become like fine cheese: something initially revolting that you grow slowly accustomed to over time--eventually realizing how complex the taste is and truly appreciating it. So, anyhow, I now have a few Dylan albums and enjoy them.  However, this week I opened up a whole new level of Dylan appreciation. #6 in the Dylan Bootleg series came out, entitled   urlLink Bob Dylan Live 1964: Concert at Philharmonic Hall  . This is not only the best Dylan album I've ever heard, it is one of the very best live albums of all time.  The concert has been available for years as a bootleg, this is its first legitimate release in the forty years since it was recorded. It is electrifying, powerful, beautiful, and poignant. The recording features a few future Dylan classics, such as "Mr Tamborine Man," "Gates of Eden," and "It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" far in advance of their studio recording and commercial release. You can hear the edge of newness to these tunes, you can hear how much Dylan believes in them.  Dylan is in a great mood during the show, talking with the audience, cracking jokes. There are even a few episodes where Dylan forgets lyrics and asks the audience for a prompt. Joan Baez (his girlfriend at the time) sings on a few tunes with him. These don't sound as good as you imagine they might, but they are still a good listen.  Throughout the concert you get the vibe that both Dylan and the crowd knew the evening was something unusual and, dare I say, magical. For Dylan, he was at the top of his game in 1964--he would never be this good again. For the audience, they were probably experiencing something I can relate to--a point, during a great concert, where you realize you are experiencing something that will become one of the greatest musical moments of your life. It is a euphoric feeling, one you gladly savor.  What an unexpected and pleasant surprise this CD has been to me this week.

      Saturday evening I was out for dinner with friends. Afterwards my friend Kim started telling me about a dream.  "I was sitting in my bedroom trying to get to sleep and I couldn't because there was this ugly, smelly dog next to me." She then told me that the reason she had the dream was because she had just looked at this blog and read the story about my childhood dachshund, Gretchen.  On the drive home, I had an epiphany. Because of Kim's story, I finally realized why I cringe whenever I hear someone say "I had a dream last night...."  First off, Kim's dream story didn't make me cringe. In fact, it was a completely fine story. As far as dream-telling goes, Kim is in the 99th percentile. However, several components of it illustrate the three reasons why other people's stories go awry--eventually boring the fuck out of me and anyone else that they inflict their ridiculous dream stories upon.  Here's why:   Number one annoying dream thing: The "big deal."  Kim didn't make her story out to be a big deal. It was just part of the conversation. That is very atypical. Most people always make their dreams out to be a big surrealist adventure that will knock your socks off with its spookiness/oddness/clever twists/etc... Trust me, your story isn't a big deal (see Number three below). In all likelihood, you will engage your friends for a few minutes, run through the details of the story with wide eyes and big gestures, then leave everyone wondering why it was worth sharing. Most of your friends will fawn interest and agree, "Boy, that was a weird story, thanks for sharing!" All the while they'll want to choke you for wasting five minutes of their life with your numbing tale. Think about that the next time you hush a crowd to share your dream about blowing your second grade teacher, who suddenly grew huge feet and spoke Chinese.   Number two annoying dream thing: I believe that your life isn't  that  weird.  When Kim was telling me her story, she cut to the chase. Almost universally, everyone else will preface a dream with something like, "Well, in the dream I was eating ice cream and a worm came out and started talking to me about vivisection and the importance of washing your face before going to bed."  Why do people always start with "Well, in this dream..." Do you think we'll get confused? We'll be left to wonder if, at 3 in the afternoon, you had some ice cream and encountered a talking worm  for real?  Come on.   Number three annoying dream thing: The never-ending tale.  The worst part about dreams isn't that they are boring, it is that they never end. Kim's story was short (it, literally, was no longer than what I wrote above). Kim's story had a point (to let me know she had visited my blog). With other people, listening to their dream is like playing house with a four-year-old, it never fucking ends.  Dream stories are usually totally absent of plot, structure, or narrative arc. Take for example the time that you had a dream...and in the dream you were at work...and you realized you were naked...and your boss walked up...and she wasn't naked...and then you realized you were late to a meeting...and you go to the meeting...and your still naked...and no one else is naked...and you are very thirsty...but there's nothing to drink...then you see a bird flying around the room...and no one notices the bird but you...and your feet are heavy...and it's difficult to walk...zzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Oh, sorry. Stories like this amount to one point...then another...then another...then another. Eventually, it goes no where. It leaves the listener worried about if and when this will ever end and they can chime in "Boy, that was a weird story, thanks for sharing!"  So please, whenever you have a crazy/wild/unusual/fascinating/whatever dream, do me--or anyone you know--a favor. Write it in your journal--right next to your deep poetry--and leave it for future generations to marvel.

      My favorite activity in Las Vegas is watching  other  people gamble away their money.* As a result, I've learned to pick up some of the hidden meanings of post-Vegas lingo. Below are some things you might hear from your friends, family, and co-workers after they deposit their retirement funds at Sin City.   What they say:  I pretty much broke even.  What they mean:  I gambled (and lost) an embarrassing amount of money.   What they say:  I didn't keep track of my winnings and losses.  What they mean:  I deliberately lost track of my losses so I could live in denial.   What they say:  I didn't spend much time in the casinos--except to look around.  What they mean:  I spent 30 minutes a day looking at casinos and four hours a day gambling in casinos.   What they say:  I stick with the slot machines.  What they mean:  I am a sucker.   What they say:  I won $100 on Tuesday.  What they mean:  I lost at least $100 on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, etc...   What they say:  While I was there, someone who was sitting three chairs down from me hit a jackpot!  What they mean:  Not only did I lose an obscene amount of money, but I had to restrain myself from choking the motherfucker who won it.  Despite books, systems, luck, methods--there is only one way to come home with money from Vegas: don't gamble.   *= To be honest, I do gamble a little. But I have a rule: never lose more than you would have spent if you had to buy your drinks (casinos hand out free drinks by the handful). When I have lost more than I've drank, it's time to wobble home.

      Thank God I'm not the only person who obsesses about things like this.  A stopped by the office of a friend the other day and she was deeply involved in some research--on how to whistle. We aren't talking about a simple "whistle while you work" type whistle, but a "several fingers stuffed in your mouth and take a deep breath" type whistle. I can't remember why this was so important to her--but she was a woman on a quest.  After thinking about it for awhile, I couldn't quite figure out how you would explain to someone how to whistle. When you want to whistle, you just...whistle. How do you explain the process in a way that someone else can hear, conceptualize, and act upon. It's like nose wiggling. I can wiggle my nose, but if you asked me how I did it--I just...wiggle my nose. It really isn't a cause and effect relationship--I just think about wiggling my nose--and it wiggles. That's it.  Afterwards, she sent me  urlLink this page  on different whistle theory and technique. Very interesting, especially since I can't whistle with much gusto at all. So I've been practicing all week, but all I'm accomplishing is turning myself blue after ten minutes of spitting on my bathroom mirror.  Some day, I will emit a hardy whistle. Mark my words, some day.

      My fussiness never reveals itself like it does when I travel. I travel a lot, often around 50,000 miles a year, and that includes a lot of short trips that are less than 500 miles each way. I've taken more than 100 flights since 2000.  So the fussiness isn't travel jitters, it's my travel preparation. I have plans, back-up plans, and back-up back-up plans. And we aren't talking a toothbrush and change of underwear in the carry-on, that is for novices.  For example, tomorrow I am traveling to DC for some meetings. In my DC trip folder (not my travel wallet--but a folder devoted solely to the mass of paper I accumulate for every trip) you will find a printed copy of my itinerary (this is separate from the copy on my Palm Pilot and in my travel wallet), detailed information (including price and timetables) for 2-3 travel options from the airport to my destination, maps of the neighborhood around my hotel and destination, and emergency contact information for the travel agent, airline, hotel, and destination (these in addition to copies, again, on my Palm Pilot and in my travel wallet).  In addition to my trip folder, my travel wallet contains a spare (otherwise never used) credit card, copies of everything, all my rental car, hotel, and frequent flier cards, and a photo of Ms Kitten and I (in case I die and want something to look at while we are crashing). I even carry my passport with me when I travel anywhere--for two reasons (a) in case I lose my other photo ID and (b)in case I get bumped from a flight and require a routing trip into Canada to get home quickly (this has happened more than once).  Lastly, I double-check and verify EVERYTHING before I leave--twice.  And I'm not preparing for freak occurrences, this stuff has paid off more than once--I've avoided having no hotel reservations, flights to the wrong city, every kind of delay and cancellation known to man, and so on. Having all this stuff readily available allows me to spring into action whenever there is a problem--and when you are one of the first in line/on the phone/knowing what to do when you and 300 fellow travelers are stranded by a canceled flight, that prep usually means you are the one most likely to end up with the good options.  A knee-jerk reaction to my travel fastidiousness might be to call me "anal retentive"--but that isn't accurate. Actually, when I travel, I am quite relaxed, easygoing, and calm. The reason: I think of, literally, everything, so there is so little chance I'll be caught off guard.  Sometimes, my own awesomeness amazes even me.

      I have a confession to make. Well, it may not be a confession, because I discuss this pretty openly, but many people are surprised to learn it.  Even though I work in radio, I never listen to the radio outside of work.  I gave up on commercial radio years ago. Outside of an occasional listen to Howard Stern, a baseball game, or a depressing trip up and down the dial--I haven't listened to the radio for enjoyment in at least eight years.  Professionally, I listen to radio all the time. I listen to my station and our competitors (public and commercial)--but I always approach it analytically. For myself, I listen to tapes/CDs in the car or CDs/cable radio/Internet audio at home.  Today, I finally purchased a  urlLink Sirius satellite radio  and it's absolutely wonderful. 100 streams of music--everything from roadhouse country to four different DJ/electronica stations. I chose Sirius over the more popular XM radio because (a) I think the music streams are better programmed and (b) Sirius has NPR, XM doesn't.  This was a big deal for me. Not only because I make my living working in radio, but because I had such a romantic view of radio as a kid--I listened constantly and loved my favorite stations.  However, as much as I have broad musical tastes--commercial radio abandoned me, I didn't abandon commercial radio.  I think there is also some escapism involved. I work in radio and think about radio all the time. It just seems like listening to the radio for fun is still always work. Satellite seems like a break from that.  And even if I didn't work in public radio, I'd still listen to public radio on an actual radio--and little else. That wouldn't change. It's the other 34 stations in my area that offer me little to nothing--and have driven me to pay $12 a month for an alternative.

      Monday I was in Washington, DC at a public radio conference, sitting in the audience looking towards the podium when I noticed this guy standing next to the stage talking to himself.  And he wasn't being discreet about it, he was talking pretty loud, gesturing with his hands and arms--it looked pretty intense.  I was pretty excited--there are all sorts of odd birds in public radio, but (to my knowledge) we don't have any crazy-enough-to-argue-in-public-with-the-voices-in-our-heads type people. But there he was, talking and flapping away.  Just as I was about to point him out to the person I was sitting with, he took a step forward. His large frame (I'm 6'1" and he was way taller than me) was hiding a small man standing on the other side of him, completely blocked from my view. It seems that this public radio employee was not crazy after all, simply having an animated conversation with someone I couldn't see.  Damn. Why does reality have to always get in the way of a good story.

      The other day I was rounding a corner, running late to something, when I noticed this old woman driving past me wagging her finger at me. She had a big, exaggerated frown on her face to boot.  I spent most of the weekend replaying the scene in my head. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out what I had done that would cause a stranger--and an old woman stranger at that--to wag her finger at me.  Yesterday, while driving home from DC, it dawned on me. I never stopped at the stop sign--I just rolled right around the corner. It's a bad habit of mine. I've lived in that neighborhood for almost eight years and only twice have I ever encountered another car at that intersection. I never stop. I never think about stopping, I just roll on through.  The old lady was obviously shaming me for being so cavalier. Who knows how that could backfire? I could run over a person. I could have ended up harming myself.  It's so easy to forget that we are all just one mistake away from permanently fucking up our lives or the lives of those around us. In America, we have too much of everything: Too much food, too many possessions, too many distractions, too many wants, too many fears. Despite our abundance, we take everything for granted. We never stop to consider the ramifications of what we do.  As I write this, I'm sitting wearing a dark grey suit and black tie. I just drove back from the funeral of one of our students. He died last Thursday night after a three year ass kicking from leukemia. He didn't give up easily and didn't die alone. He passed away at a hospice center with more than 50 friends standing by him. There were so many that they had to take turns sitting in the room with him.  His name was Steve Caynon, he was 24.

      This week I drove back and forth to DC. While on the road I listener to the new record by  urlLink The Secret Machines  about a dozen times.  Their sound is difficult to describe--kinda like if Wilco wasn't influenced by country music, but rather Led Zeppelin--this is what they'd sound like. Either that, or The Secret Machines sound like what would happen if Radiohead decided to become a jam band that covered AC/DC.  I know that makes no sense.  Anyhow...a great thing about this album is their label is really thinking outside the box and using the Internet as a marketing tool in a positive and creative way (yes, Martha, it is possible that there is some potential  benefit  to people's interest in using the Internet to enjoy music--we aren't all theives--unless you listen to the CD industry).  You can listen to the album online, for free, just by  urlLink visiting this link  or going to the band's  urlLink web site . If you like it, you can purchase it through iTunes or directly from the band's web site. They have been offering all this for several months in advance of the album's release in hopes to build some buzz about the band (such as this post--duh).  I really hope this works out and can prove to be a smart tactic for future releases.  Keep your fingers crossed.

      Several people have asked me why I don't have a "Comments" field in my blog. I could give a smartass answer, but that wouldn't be constructive now would it?  In truth, I've just been too lazy to figure out how it works.  From now on--you can leave your own two cents about my ramblings.  Go crazy.

      Hamburger Station is dead. Well, not completely dead, but dead to me.  Hamburger Station is a local "chain" of hamburger joints--all centered around the Hamburger Station signature hamburger: a small pattie, slapped in a dinner roll with some raw onions, pickle, and mustard. Now, I know that sounds a lot like a White Castle burger--but compared to Hamburger Station, White Castle is crap. Seriously, Hamburger Station is awesome. Since I had Hamburger Station before ever trying White Castle, I've never been able to stomach White Castle burgers.  Hamburger Station started off under another name, Thacker's "Snappy" Hamburgers next to the original Goodyear Tire Plant in Akron, Ohio. Then, for some unknown reason, the restaurant became a chain and changed names (probably thinking they would go on to further glory). I discovered Hamburger Station in the mid-80s and became an immediate devotee.  While the food at Hamburger station was great--the decor was pure white trash ugly and sad. I think they were shooting for a cowboy theme--yet only had a budget of about $13 per store. The remaining floor space was filled with giant industrial sized bags of potatoes and onions. Yes, the seating area was also the dry storage area. Not only did I love eating there, I loved being there.  There was a Hamburger Station in Ravenna (near Kent) which I visited regularly. Even when I was living out of town, I would always find an excuse to drive through Akron on a road trip, just to stop at Hamburger Station. In truth, I came to town more often to visit Hamburger Station than I did to visit my family.  Since the early 90s, the number of restaurants has slowly dwindled. The guy who founded Hamburger Station looked like the Ancient Crypt Keeper when I discovered the chain more than twenty years ago, so I can only associate the decline in Hamburger Station to his own probable personal decline. Now, even though there are three suburban locations left, the signature Hamburger Station store--also their last one in Akron--closed recently.  I found this out under crushing circumstances. I was in Akron for a meeting and thought I'd stop by. I drove up to the drive-through, and the Hamburger Station sign had been replaced by a "Property for Sale" sign.  I was heartbroken.

      Earlier this week Ms Kitten informed me that moccasins are making a comeback. To me, this news is bittersweet.  I remember the last time moccasins were big, it was the summer that I turned ten.  My mother took me to the craft store and we bought a kit to make your own moccasins. When I got home, I carefully unpacked all the parts and pieces, diligently read the instructions cover to cover, then proceeded to make my own footwear.  As soon as I finished, I fell in love with them. I slipped them on and hardly ever took them off again. Ever. For any reason.  Eventually, my mother started to complain.  "They smell," she offered, thinking that such a trivial detail would unhinge my affection for my beloved, self-made footwear. My mother tried to limit my moccasin wearing. She forbid me from wearing them to church, or to my Grandmothers house. My father eventually joined in on the crusade to tear my moccasins and I apart. He said that he couldn't eat around that smell, so he banned my moccasins from the dining room. Eventually, he gave in. Whenever I came into the dining room, I took my moccasins off and left them in the hallway. Bad move. Now both the moccasins and my feet were free--both able to spread their moist, pungent odor throughout their surroundings. This double-whammy proved too much. My father asked me to go wash my feet, then put the moccasins back on before resuming my dinner.  Eventually, even my moccasin-craftmen's skills proved too much for these well-loved moccasins. They became so worn that they started falling apart. My mother saw her cue and offered to buy me any shoe I wanted to replace them. Don't worry about style or price--whatever I wanted--I just had name it and it was mine.  Of course, this didn't work. My moccasins weren't that bad, I reasoned, and I continued to wear them with holes so large that my foot would slide out.  One night, my mother went on a stealth mission into my bedroom. The next morning I awoke and noticed my moccasins were gone. When I inquired with my mother, she said she had gotten rid of them during the night. I wouldn't be able to find them, so don't bother. It was for the best, she said.  I wasn't resentful, but I did miss my moccasins (I was kind of used to this--my childhood parakeet, an adopted Siamese cat, and my favorite shirt in grade school had also left my life in similar late night, covert, disappearances).  So now I hear they are coming back again. Yesterday, I was in the craft store with Ms Kitten and looked for those kits. They had them, in natural leather, black, and red. You can even get an attractive beaded ornament to sew on the front. I was tempted. Part of me thought of buying them, putting them together, then visiting my parents without saying anything.  Of course, they'd never notice--or never make the connection. Every time I share stories like this, they claim they never happened.  Denial ain't just a river in Egypt, Mom and Dad. .

      Tweo beautiful new Cds this week. Now that I've finisahed my secret book proposal, I'll actually have some time to listen to them! They are:     urlLink LP   by Ambulance Ltd.  Declared by the (overly hyperbolic) NME as the best new American band of 2004 (boy, that's a fine slice). Kind of retro-80s-alternative-sutff, but really diverse and interesting. When listening, its hard to believe you aren't listening to a compilation of several different artists. Yet, it's pretty all together and doesn't sound overly diverse and unfocused.     urlLink Soul Mosaic   by Greyboy.  DJ turned jazz buff. A nice collection of sampled riffs and original arrangements. Sours between hard funk, bee bop, and soul. So tough to categorize that I actually found it in the "jazz" section at Borders.

      Man, do I feel like an old fart.  Our neighbors just moved yesterday. Don and Judy have lived next door for about five years and they were fantastic neighbors. Don and Judy were a retired couple--Judy had actually grown up in the house, moving back here from California after her mother died (who was the previous resident--Agnes lived there when I moved in). Anyhow, Don and Judy are wonderful people and very helpful and considerate. They got tired of Ohio weather and moved to Arizona.  They sold the house to a woman from nearby Massillon, who plans on having her two daughters live there (both Kent State students). She plans to move in herself once they graduate. The weight of what this transition became very apparent last night.  Don and Judy left early Friday morning after the movers took their stuff away earlier in the week. When you have retired neighbors, you get used to them being around all the time. I was strange to see their house empty and silent.  Then, around 10 p.m., three cars pulled in to the driveway and about a dozen college-aged kids got out and went into the house. I assumed these were the two daughters--and some friends--breaking in the new "party mansion." When they were inside the house, there weren't any problems. But when they were outside, they talked among themselves like a group of deaf people. Nothing was spoken, everything was screamed.  Screamed at midnight. Screamed at 1 a.m. Screamed at 1:30 a.m. And the finale--at 3:30 a.m.  Saturday morning I was really depressed, because I was worried that I was witness the unwinding of my peaceful existence. We have other college kids on our street--but they are not a bother. In any neighbor situation, you give and take. You tolerate occasional impositions from your neighbors, and they tolerate some from you. However, this was not starting off on a good note.  Not only was I depressed, I felt really old. I'm only 37, but I found myself complaining about "those damn noisy kids" every chance I got on Saturday--to anyone who'd listen.  They came back over on Saturday, and I went over to introduce myself. I did so, welcoming them to the neighborhood, and telling that if they ever need anything, they should just give me a ring or knock on my door, I'm glad to help, blah, blah, blah.  Then I laid down the bomb on noise: they were welcome to have fun and make noise, as long as it was an occasional thing. In other words, last night was the first and last time I expected to be woken up by people peeling in and out of the driveway and screaming all night--twenty yards from my bedroom window.  I felt like a jerk. No, I felt like a crusty old jerk. But they got the point and understood where I was coming from.  Hopefully, this will all work itself out.

      From birth until age 29, I was a dyed-in-white-cotton briefs man. However, when I started dating Ms Kitten, she informed me that she was a fan of boxers and thought "tightie whities" were gross.  I immediately threw away all my Fruit of the Looms and purchases an array of boxer shorts. Since then, I've come to love the boxer and could never imagine switching back.  The other week I went clothes shopping and came back with these Kenneth Cole pants that have a very thin (not tight) cut through the hips. When I modeled them for Ms Kitten, she responded, "Maybe its time to try some different underwear."  I figured this was yet another feeble attempt to undermine my fantastically brilliant underwear purchasing system, which  urlLink I've discussed here before .  Sometimes (not all the time), I'll wear just my boxers around the house. Sometimes they have buttons or snaps, other times the fly flaps around like a carp's mouth.  I've offered to turn all my boxers over to Ms Kitten (post washing) to install snaps so that she isn't treated to semi-regular views of my inner-world. She replies that she would be happy to teach me how to install my own snaps/buttons. Whenever the opportunity comes up, she adamantly guards against becoming my seamstress. She is a master behind a sewing machine, but somehow doing favors for me will compromise her relationship status as my equal. (I'll remember this next time she needs her car washed, garbage taken out, bug killed, or heavy thing lifted--"I'm sorry honey, we're equals--bust a move on your own.")   I always respond that my brain is only so big and can hold only so much information. She can teach me how to install snaps, but then I'll forget something else--possibly something very important. For all we know, I could be driving down the road (post snap instruction) and confuse the gas pedal and the break pedal. Therefore, her snap instruction could be responsible for me driving into a pack of school children at 70 mph.  So anyhow, back to the pants...  I threw out my accusation and she replied, "Ah, no. I can see the boxer fabric bunched up underneath your pants."  "So, you want me to buy a thong so that I don't have boxer-lines? Can I then wear my thong around the house?"  "No and no," she replied, almost succeeding in sounding patient. "Perhaps you should look into boxer-briefs."  After a long explanation and illustrations about what a "boxer-brief" actually is (for those who don't know, they are basically like a pair of boxer shorts that are two sizes too small--thus hugging....er...holding...never mind). After getting the details, I immediately shot the idea down. I'm a pretty flexible guy, but need a foundation in order to feel everything is under control. With that foundation, I can take on the world.  It was at that moment that boxer shorts are an important component of my "foundation."  Ms Kitten suggested I try out a pair or two before replacing my current underwear (see, I knew there was a hidden agenda in there somewhere).  So, to cut to the chase, I bought two pair--wore one yesterday and one today. And to be honest, if I wasn't paying attention, I'd never notice the difference. And if you ask all those people who check out my butt, they'll tell you that those boxer wrinkles are gone!  I guess the moral of this story is to do what your girlfriend suggests.  Right, I think we all know that is not the moral of the story--I just thought I'd lead you on for a second.  The real moral of the story is that it is important to have limits, yet it is important to be flexible. At the end of the day, be thankful for cottony soft comfort any way you can get it.

      I had to go to the dentist today to have a filling replaced. Of course, the genius I am, I schedule the procedure for 11:30--which meant that I ended up with a new filling and a numb mouth right when my stomach wanted its lunch.  I knew I had to pick my options carefully--I needed something soft and easy to chew--so I picked  urlLink Skyline Chili  (incidentally, one of the most awesome foods known to man). In hindsight, this was a terrible idea--sloppy chili and spaghetti aren't smart when you can't feel anything east of your nose.  While I was sitting there, looking like the Elephant Man bobbing for apples, I noticed that a lot of the restaurant's staff were visiting the table next to me to make small talk. "Great," I thought to myself, "one of those 'manager-who-bothers-customers-insincerely-asking-how-their-meal-is' guys." I tried very hard not to notice anything on that side of the room, hoping that I could avoid a visit to my table (that is one of my pet peeves).  I ended up leaving just about the same time the other table did, and they stood directly in front of me at the cash register. It was the first time I noticed who was sitting there. It was  urlLink Rick Nielsen , guitarist for the band Cheap Trick. In all likelihood, they were playing down the road at Blossom Music Center (the Cleveland area's big outdoor venue) at some sad nostalgia fest.  Almost everyone that passed seemed to know him and stopped to say that Cheap Trick was "one of their all-time favorites" and wished him "good luck rockin' Blossom tonight, man."  Whatever.  After paying the bill and handing out some free Cheap Trick guitar picks, he jumped in a Lincoln with his handler and took off.  This situation would have been completely unnoteworthy if I hadn't pulled out of the parking lot, stopped at a nearby gas station, and seen Nielsen holding court in there as well.  What was up with that?  Perhaps his handler needed gas? No, the car was at a pump, but there was no gas pumping or anyone with the car.  Perhaps he needed a soda or something? No, Nielsen didn't have anything in his hands and didn't seem to have much of agenda except dialoging the Dairy Mart patrons and holding up the Slurpee machine.  Maybe his handler was getting something. No, his handler was standing next to him, pretending to be enthralled in Nielsen's tales of rock greatness right along with the customers.  Then I got the creepy feeling that maybe Nielsen was hanging out in Dairy Mart because he wanted attention. He came up with a lame excuse for stopping and was just hanging around, being noticed.  I've seen this type of thing happen before and it's disturbing. Fame and recognition can be very powerful--and difficult to let go of or watch fade over time.  Being a C-grade minorest of minor public figures, I've experienced some of this type of thing myself. To be honest, my periodic mini-bursts of fame tend to scary to me. As much as I like some attention and recognition, something weird always happens.  For example, when my book   urlLink Parental Advisory   first came out, I was having breakfast (pancakes, of course) at Bob Evans. The same day, the Cleveland Plain Dealer ran a feature on me on the front of the arts section. I noticed a guy a few tables away would look at his paper, then look at me, then look at his paper, and at me, and so on.  When he finished his meal, he walked up to me and suggested I pay for his breakfast.  He figured that since I was a big fancy famous author, I should "spread it around a bit." Now mind you, I had never seen this guy before in my life. Yet, in his eyes, I should feel obligated to pay for his skillet scramble.  I responded that if he knew what big fancy famous authors were paid for their efforts, he'd probably offer to buy my breakfast instead.  A few weeks later my hometown paper ran a profile of me on the cover of their arts section. That same night I was at a movie theater about half way between Kent and Canton, and while waiting for my popcorn some guy came up and introduced himself. He had read about me in the paper that day and was "going to go out and get my book, right away!!!" He shook my hand, and shook it, and shook it. He was still shaking my hand long after both of us had stopped talking. He just stared and smiled...and shook. Imagine going into a dark theater after that encounter.  But the capper happened a few months later when I was at a party in DC. Someone introduced me to a woman I'd never met and asked if, in fact, we had ever met before.  "Oh, I know Eric," she responded. "I see him on VH1 all the time."  Know me...from VH-1? Just because I show up on someone's television at 3 am doesn't mean that I am, somehow, "tight" with them.  Perhaps it's different for Rick Nielsen. Admittedly, while I have had a few quasi-famous moments, no one has offered me free drugs or blowjobs for writing books or being on television.  Maybe if I hang out at Dairy Mart my perks will improve.

      I can't believe I've forgotten to mention my new favorite record. Trust me though, if you want a copy, be prepared for a huge pain in the ass.  The band is called !!! (pronounced "chk-chk-chk") and their debut album is called  urlLink  Louden Up Now  . They are the last of the big Brooklyn new wave revivial bands to have a major album. Frankly, it's so good it puts the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Liars, and Radio 4 to shame. It is like a funky version of the Talking Heads. Highly recommended. The pain in the ass comes from trying to locate it in a store. Some place it under "C" (for chk-chk-chk), others place it at the beginning of the alphabetical listing (where, technically, all numbers and symbols should go) or (strangest of all) in the Various Artists section. Searching for "!!!" in many online datbases causes them to return errors. Believe me, it is worth the effort.  Even more interesting is my favorite song on the album, called "Pardon My Frredom" [sic]. The chorus of the song just repeats the lyric "Like a give a fuck, like a give a shit about that fuck." It's interesting because their label has released an "edited" version of the album and I am dieing to find out if that song became an instrumental.  If you'd like a sample, their label has  urlLink a free mp3  of one of the songs available online.  There are two other albums I've bought recently (both off of iTunes) that I really like. The first is the debut from TV On The Radio entitled   urlLink Desparate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes  . I passed this over when it first came out, thinking it was just an arty novelty album. However, I have had a complete turn around on them thanks to the single "Staring at the Sun." At first I thought the tune was just pointless and too-hipsterly odd. Then I noticed that I could never get it out of my head.  The other album is Headset's   urlLink Space Settings  , a trippy click-hop record with some great beats and raps.

      Living in Kent, Ohio, I spend a lot of time leaving Kent, Ohio. I take almost any excuse to leave and go elsewhere.  Whenever I head south, east, or west, I follow the same route out of town: down Bowman Street to Cherry Ave, left on Mogadore Road, and then six miles to the highway from there. Since I moved to Kent (for the first of several tenures in this city), I've driven this route several times a week, on and off for nineteen years. I drive past the same buildings, businesses, fields, and houses. I've seen things come and go over the years, neighborhoods get better--and worse.  However, one thing has always stayed exactly the same: a simple brick building in one of the residential neighbors on the outskirts of Kent. It's only ornamentations are two small windows and a sign that says "Ciccone's Bar and Restaurant." I have never been inside Ciccone's and have never known anyone who'd been inside. But there always seems to be lights on inside, a neon BUD sign in the window, and a few cars outside. So, even though it is not the most inviting location in the world, I've always assumed Ciccone's is open for business. Yet, what goes on in there has always been a mystery.  When I accepted the job at NPR, Ms Kitten asked me what I wanted to do to celebrate.  My answer: Go to Ciccone's.  Surprisingly, she agreed, so we headed over.  We had no idea what to expect, during the drive over (it is only five blocks from my house), I ran through the various assumptions, visions, and scenarios that have momentarily filled my mental image over the years of what Ciccone's actually is.  My favorite has always been the mom and pop Italian restaurant. The hidden culinary gem of Kent, Ohio. In this vision, I'd walk inside to be greeted with open arms by a short, plump Italian woman who would chant "Manga, manga" while I wolfed down platefuls of steaming spaghetti and meatballs.  My other vision is the crusty, Cheers-like bar, filled with surly (but lovable) characters. In this vision, I'd walk in and by the time I left, everyone would know my name and I'd be anxious to return to learn of my new drinking buddies' latest goofy hijinx.  We pulled in to Ciccone's and walked up to the front door and pulled.  And pulled and pulled.  It was stuck.  Eventually it popped open and we walked through a cobweb-filled, pitch black foyer to a set of swinging doors which were also stuck closed (but eventually opened). Inside the swinging doors where chairs blocking the aisle. Looking around the bar, I immediately realized that the "preferred" method of entrance and exit was through the side door near the kitchen. I was probably the first person to try to come in through that door in years. They probably didn't even lock it at night.  The patrons (term used loosely--as there was four people in this massive room) were split into two groups. One woman was on the left end of the bar, talking to the bartender. Two men and a woman sat on the opposite end.  We took a seat at the end near the bartender, who cheerfully came over to ask our order. Before we could even answer, one of the men at the other end of the bar belched so loud my neck hair stood on end. The noise was amplified by the room. Ciccone's is a big place, lined with booths and filled with empty tables and chairs. It is obvious from the set-up that, at one time, Ciccone's was quite the happening place. Not so much today.  "Just a minute," responded the bartender (we learned a few minutes later--after several other similar emissions--that this gentleman's gastric releases were his way of getting the bartender's attention for service).  Ms Kitten and I ordered a Heineken (me) and a vodka/Cranberry (Ms Kitten). The bartender squinted her eyes and shot an "I told you so" look over her nose towards her friend. The look implied something very clear to all:  City folk.  After dusting off a Heineken and pouring Cranberry juice that looked as if it was bottled during the Ford administration, we were served and everyone went back to their business.  I interrupted the bartender's conversation once more to see if they served food (waiting, of course, for the platefuls of spaghetti to emerge from the dark kitchen).  "No," she replied. After several seconds of silence, she added. "We got nuts."  "Well,..." I said, as I felt Ms Kitten grab my knee, knowing that I was about to reply that I, too, had nuts, but that didn't mean that someone could have them for dinner. I heeded Ms Kitten's silence advice and kept quiet. I did, however, notice a handmade sign behind the bar advertising Friday night as "Coney Night." I figured that, since it was Tuesday, I could live without any leftover hot dogs.  Ms Kitten and I stayed for the remainder of our drinks and chatted to ourselves. The woman and two men at the other end of the bar continued to have quite a good time. They all did shots (ordered, via belch, every three minutes), told dirty jokes, and flirted. As we got up to leave (through the side door-duh!), I got a good look at them.  Standing next to the woman was a young boy, about eight, just staring at the television. I realized it was her son. Her son, standing in a bar while Mommy did shots, flirted, and told nasty jokes with two men, one of whom communicated through burping.  It was at that moment that I understood how Ciccone's had hung on so long: they start training them at an early age.  Ms Kitten and I bid out goodbyes and went elsewhere for dinner. No hugs from short Italians, no meatballs, and no new lifelong wacky friends.  Some mysteries are better left as mysteries.

      I'm leaving Ohio to go work at NPR. I'm leaving Ohio to go work at NPR. I'm leaving Ohio to go work at NPR. I'm leaving Ohio to go work at NPR. I'm leaving Ohio to go work at NPR.  Damn, that feels good to finally say it "out loud."  Several times I've written here about having a few secrets that I was sitting on. That is the big one. In July I end my tenure at WKSU and in August I move to DC and start work at National Public Radio.  That's also the reason I've been really lax in writing on this blog lately. I always let everything "hang out" here, with an embarrassing degree of honesty. This job, move, etc... have been so consumming that I haven't been able to focus on much else for months. I've kept it secret because I didn't want to (potentially unnecessarily) alarm the people I work with. But this morning, in a very difficult and emotional moment for me, I let my staff in on the big secret.  It is amazingly exciting and difficult at the same time. I'm just happy that its out in the open.  I'm sure there will be plenty of obsessive/stupid/meandering postings about all the changes coming in my life.  Stay tuned....

      Sorry for the cheesy title, but it is true.  For the past five years, I've had a beat-to-Hell 64 meg mp3 player that held about two album's worth of material. It has served me well and despite some occasion quirks and glitches, still works okay.  But as the iPod has caught on, I've really coveted one. At first, all that storage felt like overkill and I was kind of scared off by the price. A 40 gig player for $500 is a bit rich for my blood, the cheapo that I am.  So, a few weeks ago, I read that Apple was selling reconditioned units (for those who don't know--reconditioned units are those that were bought by someone else but were defective--the manufacturer fixes the original problem and resells them at a discount) for $125 off (okay, $100 off plus free overnight shipping--basically $125). I cracked and bought one.  So I got my new iPod and started ripping the tracks off my CDs. In fact, I spent over a week ripping songs off 800 CDs. Despite my initial wonder as to how I could ever fill up 40 gigabytes of music, I spent several days painfully trimming my playlists--because I don't have enough room.  If Apple made a 60 gigabyte iPod, I'd be good (but barely). But they  don't, so I'm stuck playing Solomon with my CDs.  It feels like this is oddly against the point of having an iPod in the first place. The whole point is that you are supposed to be able to have  all  your music available on this little thing. However, I found myself deleting songs and albums left and right.  When you are faced with the promise of having everything you own (an entire wall of CDs in my house) available in your shirt pocket, starting to delete stuff off the list is especially painful.  You can  urlLink click here  to see a list of what I finally settled on. I'll probably make some additions and subtractions (it was especially difficult deciding between Wilson Picket and Curtis Mayfield--I kept a bit of both--and which Sleater-Kinney albums I could  possibly  live without).

      Like I've been saying, one reason that I've been slight on the blog posts over the past few weeks is that I have a bunch of things going on that are consumming my mental space, yet are closely-guarded secrets.  Last night the first of them came to a head--I asked Ms Kitten to marry me.  She said yes.

      It you weren't looking, you missed it.  If you were looking, you were probably blinded by the process.  I am speaking, of course, of Venus's trek in front of the sun this week. Venus was a visible pimple on the sun from Tuesday morning through today.  The last time Venus pulled this stunt was 1878 and while it will happen again in another 13 years, the time after that won't occur for over two hundred years.  I hate whenever these things happen. The newspapers and news channels paint them as being ultra-rare gifts from God. The media are filled with instructions about how to safely view the coming event of celestial awesomeness, verbose articles on how/why these things happen, and so on.   They almost make it seem that if you don't run outside, you are somehow living a diminished life.  Seize the day? Not for the fuckers who sleep in and miss THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SOLAR EXPERIENCE OF...the year.  Yeah, for as hysterical as the media gets about these events, it seems that a new celestial happening occurs every year. A comet/planet/star/whatever will do something and everyone gets their panties in a bunch with excitement. They say things like "This only happens once every 400 years--what a gift to be able to view it."  Then, a year later, you see the same motherfucker on the news saying that if you miss the coming lunar eclipse, you are the lamest geek in the solar system.  I'm not buying it. Venus could do the foxtrot in front of the Sun and I'm not going to miss the History Channel special on homemade helicopters that is competing for my attention.  I'll wait for next year's once in a lifetime experience.

      ...that means I'm listening to some new music.   PJ Harvey's   urlLink Uh Huh Her  .  A nice return to PJ playing guitar, less slick production, and grittier song writing. She is amazingly inconsistent, but this is a swing in the right direction.   Slicker's   urlLink We All Have a Plan  .  A noise/click-hop record by John Hughes III, the song of the director of  The Breakfast Club  and  Sixteen Candles . Not tellar, but a fun diversion.

      Ronald Reagan died yesterday. Good riddance. I hope there is a special place in Hell awaiting the father of the Moral Majority, "Compassionate" Conservatism*, and the man who legitimazied covert government action, complete lack of concern for the social welfare of our country (oh, I'm sorry, he was in favor of smaller government--my bad), and deficit government spending that my grandkids will have to take a second job to pay off.  Next time I'm in California, I'll stop by the Reagan library so that I can piss on his grave.   *=If "Compassionate" Conservatism* is so great, what does that make regular conservatism--dispassionate?

      My grandmother doesn't cook. Never has. When she was raising kids, my great-grandmother lived with them and did all the cooking. Since my great-grandmother died, my grandparents eat out once a day and have cold cuts, left-overs or something pre-made for their other meal. My grandmother has never even boiled pasta.  But what does she collect? Cookbooks and kitchenware.  She believes that someday she'll somehow find the time to learn to cook (she's 83) and will be whipping out flambe and baked Alaska until she is called to the great kitchen in the sky. Of course, I make fun of her for this endlessly.  Yet, when I go to Williams Sonoma--I salivate over the selection--knowing that, while I know how to cook, I never have enough time to cook/bake to justify owning $20 hot pads or a $35 bundt cake pan. I justify my purchases with the idea that I will, someday, find the time to do more.  I guess the nut doesn't fall far from the tree.

      I was ordering some pants online the other week and was inspired. I bought some green pants. When I say green, I mean really fucking green ( urlLink see for yourself ).  Well, I wore them for the first time today, and from people's reactions, you would have thought that I'd shown up for work wearing no pants what-so-ever.  Now, I definitely do not consider myself a fashion plate by any stretch, but I figured, "Hell, it's summer time, why not some green pants?" I wouldn't be the first to notice that most mens fashion, especially pants, tends to be pretty dull and unadventurous. These are green pants, but not like crazy green 80s parachute pants or anything. Honestly, I didn't think it would be such a big deal.  A sampling of comments received today:  "It takes a man with a lot of self-confidence to wear pants like that."  "My God, those pants are...green."  "How artistic."  The problem is that now that these pants have made such a strong impression, I can't get away with wearing them too often. On one hand, that means they will last longer (providing colorful comfort for years to come), on the other--that means that I'll have to buy another pair of pants to make up for the usefulness I should have gotten out of these green pants.

      Bought the debut from  urlLink Nanobot Auxillary Ballet  from iTunes today. Interesting stuff. Electronic pop music made from noise. Ironically simplistic, yet still a lot of fun.

      Miss Kitten finally read one of my favorite novels--  urlLink The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay   (I've been subtley trying to get her to read it for three years). I didn't read a lot on vacation, but have been burning through Brian Hick's   urlLink Ghost Ship   since we got back. It is the story of a ship that drifted into a port in 1872. It's crew was missing and there was no sign of what happened: no signs of struggle, piracy, abadoning ship during a storm, or disease. They just disappeared.  Didn't take any music on vacation earlier, nor did I buy anything while out of town. I'm still in love with my new  urlLink Sirius radio --which is taking up a lot of my in-car listening time.

      I've gotten a few emails complaining/rejoicing about my lack of posts over the past two weeks.   I am a "gentleman of leisure" for the three weeks between jobs. I spent a week hanging out with my 8-year-old nephew who was visiting from Colorado. Activities included making Sponge Bob cookies, plaster castings of body parts (get your minds out of the gutter, sicko) and swimming as much as possible.   This week I'm working on some writing projects and getting ready to move. Next week is back and forth between Kent and DC geting moved in.   So, basically, I'm taking some time off--because I want to.   More later.

      I've been lax about posting my new music acquisitions. Here's a bunch of new additions:    Miss Kittin   urlLink I Com  :  From the German DJ/songstress. Much better than I expected.   The Roots   urlLink The Tipping Point  :  From hip hop's&nbsp;gretest live band (not a big accomplishment, seeing that they are one of hip hops  only  live bands. I've loved their last few albums, this one is not as fun or adventurous. I'm afriad it's already heading towards the Amazon pile.   The Helio Sequence   urlLink Love and Distance :   An interesting disc, the jury is still out.   The Hives   urlLink Tyrannosaurus Hives :   37 minutes of fucking brilliance.

      Today was my last day at WKSU. I first walked in the door there when I was 19 while I was in school. I was a big NPR fan by then (my parents were regular listeners) and talked&nbsp;my way into a two-hour a week job at the station minding open reel playback of   urlLink A Prairie Home Companion  . I decided that&nbsp;I wanted to learn everything&nbsp;I could about the station and how it operated, eventually pitching on-air during station fund drives, helping produce recordings and broadcasts of classical and folk concerts, and became the station’s interim Operations Coordinator—all before&nbsp;I turned 21.   Eventually, my work at WKSU got caught up in the haze of&nbsp;the end of my college years&nbsp;and I left. In 1995 I came back expecting to stay there for two years while I finished my bachelor's degree at Kent. Then, as they say, life got in the way. I met Ms Kitten there (when I almost ran her over in the hallway), made great friends, had some of my best (and worst) professional experiences there, and eventually became the station's program director (in 1998).   Leaving WKSU feels a lot like leaving home. It is equally terrifying and exciting.   The staff threw a going away party for me, which I expected to be very emotional. It was, but I held it together well.   Later that afternoon, when it became time to say good-bye. I started walking around the building, saying my farewells one at a time. Both my feelings, and the feelings of my co-workers, were much more difficult than I imagined.   I said every one clutching my keys.   My keys had taken on a highly symbolic role to me in those last few days.&nbsp; I had turned in or packed up everything over my last few days, but I held on to my keys. Those keys were a symbol of my position to me. I was one of only three station employees who had keys to everything in the station. By the time I said my goodbyes, my office was empty, my car packed, instructions and files passed to the appropriate people--but I still had my keys.   As the goodbyes went on, I could feel the emotion of the day starting to well up. But I dealt with it by holding on to those keys. The last person I said goodbye to was our general manager's assistant. Outside of being the person who processes new hires (thus, the first person I interacted with as a WKSU employee), she is also in charge of the keys.   I walked in to her office and told her I had to do this quickly. Without saying a word, I gave her a hug, placed the keys on her desk, and walked straight out the front door.   I bit my lip until I got home. Ms Kitten was there and thought I was joking (about looking so upset). She gave me a hug and I let loose all the tension and emotion of leaving). Outside of church, I can't imagine a single institution in my life that has had such a profound impact on my life than WKSU.   After five minutes of purging, I wiped my eyes and said, "Okay, let's go celebrate."   And we did.

      I'm in Asheville, North Carolina today to give a speech. It's the first time I've ever been here, so last night I went for a long walk to find some dinner (and ice cream) as an excuse to discover all that is Asheville.  I noticed two things almost immediately. Asheville has an exceptionally large number of hippies and hair salons. I noted these things because, not only were they pretty obvious, but because they usually do not "go together" very well.  Within the first five blocks from my hotel, I encountered four hair salons (that's almost one on every block), as well as several business that cater to the patchouli and Phish-listening crowd: two organic restaurants, two independent coffee shops, a plant store, a make-your-own-pottery store, and an African store that seems to sell only small beaded bags and incense (gee, I wonder what those are used for?).  It shouldn't be surprising that there are so many hippie-catering businesses, you can't swing a stem of kind bud in this town without hitting a few wayward free-thinkers. It's as if someone gave the hippies too much water and they've been reproducing faster than anyone can keep up with (vague Tribbles reference there if you missed it).  And the hair salon thing just makes it even weirder--for two reasons. One, they look like salons that cater to elite and hipster (by the modern standard) clientele. They are all beautiful shops with picturesque people working in them. Secondly, I didn't see many people (read: none) in Asheville who looked like they had patronized these establishments in the past five or six years.  Unless these places specialize in maintaining white person dreadlocks, I'm not entirely sure how they stay in business--let alone so many stay in business. (Don't be fooled by the hippie demeanor--someone trying to go for the white person dreads spends more time on their hair than an entire class of 8th grade girls.)  I did do my walk at about 7pm and Asheville may be one of those towns that empties out of most residents after 5pm (plus it's summer, so whatever college is associated with "College Street" must be out of session). Perhaps the hippies are the only ones left because, you know, hippies have a tendency to linger.

      Ms Kitten and I have an on-going argument (actually, we have many on-going arguments, like if I ever claimed that Elvis Costello produced the first Specials album--which I never did). This argument is over wedding registries.  I'm against the whole notion. I think it is crass and brazenly materialistic to invite people to a party then give them a list of what they can buy for you. Plus, Ms Kitten and I have been very fortunate--there really isn't a lot we "need" (as compared to what we "want"). If someone wants to buy us a Jet Ski or a 4-bedroom house, that we need (okay, maybe not the Jet Ski). Otherwise, we're in pretty good shape.  However, since we're paying for the wedding entirely on our own, Ms Kitten has convinced me to go ahead with some wedding registry stuff.  To poke fun at the whole discussion, Ms Kitten went to Wal-Mart Friday night with her friend Sarah and created our first wedding registry. It is filled with stuff like chain saws, little boys underwear, pregnancy tests, candy bars, and a porcelain figure of Jesus.   urlLink Check it out  for yourself.
