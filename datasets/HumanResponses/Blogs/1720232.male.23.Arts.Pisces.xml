      i've attempted far too many times to write about my trip on thursday to  urlLink raging waters , but really it boils down to these few things: -getting sun block in your eyes is one of the most painful experinces i've encountered in my whole life. it hurt more than having a baseball thrown at my arm by chone figgins. -mexican people really do swim in their clothes and some even swim in sexy, lacey black cammies. -raging waters has way better rides than  urlLink wild rivers , but longer lines. -jail bait a hoy, yet ironically, i did not feel painfully old nor out of place at raging waters -the latina britney spears ('baby one more time' era) or latina teagan presely works as a lifeguard there. -the real life version of  urlLink kip & lafawnduh  were there and they popped each other's zits while in line or they were adult film stars or they were both and popped its each other backne. -44 oz white cherry flavored icees make you sick. -the ridve, 'the vortex' is basically what i assumed my birf was like. cold, dark, wet, and scary. at the end, i was struggling for air. -you pretty much need at 3 other people with you to have a full on 'raging' time. -there are bees every where, so you may want to rock a bee keeper's helmet.  - urlLink  thriller:a cruel picture  , the sweedish revenage film that was 'homaged' in tarantino's bloody brilliant  kill bill  gets a limited dvd release. i got mine, so you better get yours cause i'm not the one to loan out movies.  - urlLink new g-unit mix tape!!!  featuring alot of stuff from the recently leaked young buck album and newest member of g-unit, game. i'm still waiting on the yayo mix tape.  - urlLink "right side of the bed" by arteyu  is my new fav metalcore video. not only does it feature a paris hilton look alike with bad implants, but it features gratious HxC kids guitar riff finger thing and air guitar action as well as 'xxx' belt action.  and finally,      i saw the bee girl last night at dinner. shes' a waitress now and lives in my home town.

        two things that i've learned since my attendence of the angels/rangers game tonight:  1) don't fumble around with your picture phone while outfielder  urlLink chone figgins  is warming up because he'll probably throw a baseball in your direction and it'll smash into your left arm, like it did with me tonight. the ball bounced off my arm and into the stands and some dude just grabbed it. isn't there such a thing as common deceny amongst men over foul balls that destroy peoples arms? you would think that the dude seeing the ball bounced off my arm would give it to me, but no. the guy was a selfish asshole. it should be noted that figgins saw that i wasn't on the ball as well as potential mvp candiate,  urlLink vladmir 'giggles' guerroro  tossed me a ball to keep. so yeah, if you're gonna sit in the home run section, don't fuck around with your camera phone no matter how sexy it may be. and mine is pretty sexy. its got a picture of rachel bilson on it and a flaming lips song as its ringtone. so i have a large bump on my left arm; put a cold beer to reduce the swelling.  second thing, i learned:  urlLink carl's jr 's bbq chicken sandwich is amazing.  going down to san diamas on thursday morning. hoping to run into  urlLink bill & ted  while i'm in town or at least see the coolest napolean of all time, napolean  boner part.  ps. fuck rollingstone.com's ringtone of usher's "yeah"; so not worh 2 bucks.  "you have eyes like a gorillia"

      some may say, "worst day ever" and those who say that are pretty fucking dead on in the description of tuesday for yours truly.   after an 'mst3k' style viewing of disney's  urlLink  song of the south   and the delightful emergence of 'moonwalking kitties' on monday night at hop's place, we all relunctly woke up at different times all through out the 5o'clock hour to embark on a journey to the ryan seacrest show to see ashlee simpson perform her hit single, "pieces of me," and you know, be apart of the scene.  whatever scene that is, they did not want us to be apart of it. after a hellacious journey from the 57 to the 60 to the 101 during morning rush hour, we arrive at seacrest 8 in the morning. at this point, we thought we'd be safe, we'd get a spot inside, but no, no way jose. the line was already around the block. the line was mostly 12 year old girls in bright colors and flip flops. not to mention, girls wearing short skirts who had no business whatsoever wearing a skirt of such length. it was already a lost cause as myself and hollywood brown shuffled down the steps to get a spot in line.  we should've cut our losts at that point, but what we would've gained is even more fun sitting on the 101 again, but maybe we'll get to hear stern talk about his message board again.   so we waited and waited with inane chatter happening behind us. talk of the breast implants and the damage done to the cuticles from being a hair dresser interwoven with my talk of 'hand shakes and hand jobs' being given at the burger king across the street. the blistering heat destroyed our will and the smog from highland ave destroyed our lungs. we were like coppola and little by little, we went insane.  well, me and hollywood. we began to wave at passing traffic and asking for the big rig drivers to honk their horn and being giddy like school children inbetween half hearted attempts at singing phoenix's "everything is everything".  and of course, doing the kittie moonwalk into the intersection.   so we got our walking papers from the audience cordinator and sat in the courtyard of the highland & hollywood complex in the shade. while we sat, i learned that reality tv isn't really that real.  on seacrest, they were doing an 'ambush' makeover with the people from  urlLink "ambush makeover" . we sat and watched them rehearse the ambush of the make over victim a few times, then taped it; didn't work, and did another take. so guess what, kids, reality tv is not real. although, the guy from "ambush makeover" looks like a fucking tomato in designer jeans in real life.   a mini celebrity spilt of sorts went down today. a friend of mine broke up with his girlfriend. if britney & ashton can't make it, and if these kid can't make it, then what hope is there for love these days?  we went down to amoeba, which so far has provided the only highlight. we spotted  urlLink deputy dewey  buying movie soundtracks on vinyl. finally found a copy of  urlLink hollertonix 's amazing mix, "never scared" and truffaut's   urlLink shoot the piano player   as well as one of the best albums of the year, "alphabetical" by phoenix. so that was cool.  then i come home and attempt to set up the media me plan on my new phone with even more disasterious results. yes, i have a picture phone, but i can not upload any pictures from it. so it's all one big mess; its all my fault and i'll be up early in the morning to fix all of my problems.  uf, one of the worst days in recent memorey.  at least, i have my  urlLink charla  tonight.  [editor's note: as i wrote this, i watched the episode of seacrest in question and came to the conclusion that i wasn't missing that much, and dare i say this, ashlee simpson kinda sucked when she performed her hit single, 'pieces of me'. not to mention, the ap reports  urlLink seacrest out! permantely  i liked trl better anyways;  urlLink vanessa minnillo , what a babe!]

      apparently, i think i'm better than everybody cause i'm from the oc, which couldn't be more further than the truth. if you knew me, really, really, really, really, really knew me, you would know that i think  so  less of myself because i live behind the orange curtain.   sure, i may live a life style that is mildly atypical of a character from a hit  urlLink television series  that glamourizes my home, but i'm so far from it.   sure, i wear  urlLink paul frank  shirts, but he's not my friend by any strencth of the imagination.  so, i drive a car with a gps system, xm radio installed, leather seats and a in dash 6 disc cd changer; but its a fucking  urlLink  honda  and its covered with bird shit and i can't even park it in a car port because every time i try i get a panic attack.  all right, i have an am ex card, but the fact is, the only reason i have it, is so i can build a decent line of credit. my father, the banker explained this to me, so when i buy home, it'll be alot easier cause i'll have  good credit .  so if one is going to attack me becauses i live in orange county, they should think before they launch into some ill convinced attack. not to mention, one should not go up to a person and just touch their hair. its a thing called spacial issues. further more, the night in question had been the first night in nearly week that i left my house when it was going to the vet or going back in 15 minutes due to the health status of my dog, so being on the phone, to check in on my dog and to see if she's taken her meds, isn't being rude, its just being a cocerned pet owner.   so in other words, if you think i'm an asshole because i'm more interested in my dog than you. then frankly, i want nothing to do with you and your shitty life style.   with that off of my chest....      -young buck's solo debut, "straight outta ca$hville" has leaked; you may find it  urlLink here . here's the problem with the solo albums from the g-unit; both albums lack that perfect blend of gun raps and club anthems. lloyd banks wants to do club anthems, yet ends up sounding like method man on a couple of tracks and young buck wants to be exactly like 50, but his rhymes are transparent and seem to follow 50's blueprint. although, the track, "bang bang" has a nice chipmunk soul sample of nancy sinatra's "bang bang (my baby shot me down)".  - urlLink paris hilton pulls a 'kirsten dumpst' on nick carter . frankly who cares? we all knew that paris could do better than a pudgy boy member with hair like david la chappelle (the uncool chappelle).  - urlLink the hives'  new album, "tryannosaurs hives" is the musical equilvent of  urlLink oreos  for me. they taste great when you first open them up, you can't stop eating them, but eventually, they get stale. so right now, i'm in the phase where i think the album is great, but ask me in a week or two from now, i'm probably not even listening to it anymore.  - urlLink the either much loved or hated, depending upon the day of the week band, franz ferdinand is fixing to get automator on the fader for their next album  personally, i just wish that automator would finish his solo album already or do another hip hop record. less rock, more kool keith! no release date for the new handsome boy modeling school effort, yet, but automator's rather lame team up with the bro from glassjaw,  urlLink  head automatica  is touring with the cure this summer  -robert rodigruez & frank miller's  sin city  is getting alot of good buzz at comic con this past weekend,  urlLink here  and  urlLink here . even though, i've heard that the film is going to be probably the most literal comic book big screen adaptation; i'm exteremly disappointed to discover that even though her character in the comics is either buck naked or topless for a majority time, jessica alba will not.  boo!  side note: robin 'hollywood' brown attended comic con and saw  urlLink the coreys  on a smoke break.  - urlLink  catwoman  has a disapointing openning weekend , who's surprised?  -defamer  urlLink tells us that brit brit is a major sneekzer , but then again, who's surprised?  on friday night, i attended the rilo kiley record release show at the john anson ford amphitheater. random thoughts: -best outdoor venue for a show. there's no such as a bad thing as bad seat; its very iminate and casual.  -rilo kiley had free face paintings, snow cones, and balloon animals. so just imagine all of the la hip kids eating snow cones and holding balloon doggies and dancing. -no 'the oc' kids spotted or at least i did not see any. apparently tobey magiure was there, i believe i'm at the point with tobey magiure where i can't recongize him unless he's wearing the spider man costume or next to kirsten dumpst, which is sad. i did see two thirds of the sexy band,  urlLink the like ; although i always see their drummer at rilo kiley shows, so it doesn't count. -the  napolean  effect; yeah, scene kids are dressing like him now, cept they're not rocking the snow boots yet. -drinking some brews + ben gibbard acoustic=good times; although before i had my drink, i was on the verge of falling asleep during his set. everybody else woke up when jimmy tamborello and jenny lewis joined the stage for "such great heights." well, i assume that everybody was falling asleep during his set, but they probably weren't, if anything, rilo and death cab should probably tour together. -rilo kiley did alot of new songs; they're good. they did mostly jenny songs; only two blake songs. they sounded good and they could be, i shudder to say this, but they could be vh-1 darlings, which i wouldn't mind because the less 14 year old kids at shows, the better i feel. all ages show=i feel super old; 21+ shows=feel super young.  if i did 'weird al' style paradoies, my new paradoy would be of the killers and their smash hit, "indie rock n roll" cept mine would be "indie rock moms" 'it's indie rock moms for me/its all i need'.   urlLink lloyd: hip hop and r&b's answer to clay aiken or just an abuser of weird 'cher' esque vocal effects?       ashlee simpson on ryan seacrest, tuesday afternoon. probably waking up at 5:30 in the morning to be the first line to get inside to see ashlee shake her ass and get softballs tossed at her.  don't forget that one of the best albums of the year comes out this tuesday. its entitled, "alphabetical" and its by  urlLink phoenix . its as if brian wilson hung around with the band, air in france for a little while and decided to make a record.

      - urlLink blonde redhead  are playing the henry fonda & glasshouse with  urlLink the liars  on november 19th, 20th, & 21st; on sale this saturday.  -one of s.diego's few all ages venues,  urlLink soma  reports that everybody's former favorite band,  urlLink the faint  is hitting the road in november and word has it with  urlLink tv on the radio ;  if i go, i'm leaving after the faint does "worked up so sexual" cause i'm claiming 'danny glover' status.  - urlLink steve-o  was on stern this morning; talked about how he parties with an sports illsturated swimsuit  urlLink model  and worked on a g unit mix tape with  urlLink whoo kid! ;  urlLink steve-o has bling and is doin' the thing   -while the new interpol album has leaked and everybody has creamed their designer jeans over it; why hasn't the new  urlLink blood brothers  album leaked yet? or if it has, and you have a copy, i'd like to take a listen.   - urlLink charla is the best thing about television right now  i nearly threw up from laughing at this past week's episode when she got electricuted. although her team mate is a total bitch.  - urlLink tom green & jerry spinger have aspirations of ripping off vh-1's best week ever . didn't they learn anything by checking out e!'s horrible  urlLink what the? awards ?

      dr. chocolate from andy dick's brilliant show, "the assitant," on  urlLink myspace  y'all.   so if you want to know which girl on the show andy dick slept with, she's a good source of answers.  my personal opinion is the scarlett johansson-esque,  urlLink melissa

      -pitchpork  urlLink reports  that 'seth cohen' rock poster kids death cab for cutie have plans to tour with pretty girls make graves in the fall. expect lots of guys wearing  urlLink penguin shirts  with their girlfriends who'll look as if urban outfitters threw up all over them; in other seth cohen rock news,  urlLink postal service's cover of phil collins lands on the soundtrack to a lame josh hartnett film   -everybody's favorite, but not mine, film,  napolean dynamite   urlLink gets a wider release and a new ending ; how about this instead, an explanation as to who the woman that showed up to uncle rico's van at the end or just a cohesive plot.  -while i have not listened to all of ashlee simpson's album(its in the car), but i'll tell you this much, she's basically the disney channel's version of courtney love; she aspires to rock like pat bentar, but ends up sounding like the lady who sang "bette davis eyes" doing blondie covers. she lost some cred cause she shouts out benji & joel from good charolette in the linear notes. its a good starting record for your 11 year old sister, you know if you want to be a rocker or something.  - urlLink stern to be sued by clear channel  for doing what they hired him to do. in other stern news, they're still not letting anybody else join  urlLink their message board   - urlLink stereogum shows us that brit-brit's boy toy has a pair of nikes for every day of the week  laces sold separetly.   -variety reports  urlLink michael bay will produce a prequel to  texas chainsaw massacre  remake   - urlLink ratatat  recently released a remix album and its a very calming, relaxing hip hop album. if jay-z makes a comeback, he should get them to do a beat or two.

         urlLink shaq promises to bring the title to miami and talked about how he likes to be naked on the beach ; meanwhile the la lakers want to bring it back to '91 with the signing of the flopmeister general, urlLink vlade! . i'm going to miss shaq press conferences; for who else on the lakers is going to call the sacremento kings, 'the queens' and call himself, "the nfl's best basketball player".  sadly, my dog has a golden band aid on her front paw and has been sleeping on a purple blanket. she's unknowningly repping the lakers and i'm not sure if she wants to.   aicn has an excellent interview with zombie film demi god, george romero on his next zombie epic,  land of the dead . it can be read  urlLink here . apparently the budget for the new film is in the 'teens' of millions; i loved romero's thoughts on the recent   urlLink dawn of the dead   remake: "a hot action flick".   urlLink the fever’s “gray ghost”  which has to be one of the better music videos i’ve seen in a long time; not to mention, the song is super catchy and i feel utterly stupid for sleeping on  urlLink the fever . they'll be in the orange county area on august 7th at  urlLink the wee wee soaked heck hole  with moving units. be there and feel really, really, really, really old.   urlLink new beck in october with the dusties behind the boards ; when are we going to get a dust brothers solo album? or did that already come out and i totally slept on it?  i hate the fact that i like the new hives song. its so catchy and sounds exactly like a who song.  the company my father just started working for helps provide financing for indie films and he told me that they did  urlLink  the limey  ; my father, easily the smartest man i know, he can hand million dollar loans, but can not make a mix tape.       i love me alba zabla, but did the producers of  fanstatic four  completely miss out on the concept of kate busworth as sue storm?

         with my past weekend, i just wanted somebody to say that line to me or say it to somebody. the best dog ever, nelson has been in and out of the vet from some pretty bad health problems, but she's out to prove the vets wrong because she's getting better and fighting the good fight. alot of stress and tears have been shed; we were hoping for the best and expecting the worst. we got the best and we're going to cherish every day we got left with her. she's probably 13 years old (we got her at the pond and they had no clue as to her age) and basically, her age has finally caught up with her.  robin brown, hops, and evelynn all paid a visit on saturday night, our darkest hours and cheered me and my mother up. sitting around the table, eating pie, and making jokes about fat kids named andy and how all they think is candy and watching the trash cinema classic,   urlLink get over it  (gratuious mila kunis & kirsten dunst bikini action as well as gratious sisquo reaction shot action, so sexy).   i wished that my vet offered a frequent visitor like a sandwich shop may have. you know, you've gotten this many x-rays, and when you get your sixth one, its on the house; something like that. instead of that forced conversation about how they love your dog and want her to get better. as sick as it sounds, when we took her to the urgent care center for over night care, i prefer that vet beceause he was the most honest. he sat us down and basically said, that you know what, nelson may not make through the night, she's pretty sick as opposed to saying she's going to be normal. i prefer a sense of pemistic optimism.  so please excuse my lack of updates. i have good reasons.  -first to fight, formeley known as death from above has changed their name again, to  urlLink  DEATH FROM ABOVE 1979  ; i dunno, still sounds lame and as some say its shades remiscenet of fellow canadian rockers,  urlLink sum41! . -defamer ran a piece of  urlLink "the oc"  kids been spotted around la and warning everybody who attends an 'indie' show, will probably see them. i'm going to the rilo kiley show on friday night; i'll be on the prowl, but if i see rachel bilson, i'll probably cream my designer jeans and i'll have to tie a sweater around my waist, the rest of the night, such a good look, the look of a 30 year old woman with a big ass. although, what can be worst than ruining or enchancing your jeans because you see a goddness known as rachel b, is that you run into somebody who knows you from  urlLink lsp  like the two weeks you were on there and they strike up awkward convos with you in between bands. i usually say, "no whammies" over and over again at rilo kiley shows and so far, its worked; well the one time, i did it.  -speaking of the oc kids, i saw an interview with adam brody at the fox launch party, here's what trasnpered:     reporter: so what's happening on this upcoming season of "the oc"? brody: no fucking clue. i think that people love seth cohen, but just have a general disdain for adam brody.   since, i'm on the morning shift of the nelson health care party plan, i will most likely not be one of the first 500 people to purchase ashlee simpson's hit album, "autobiography" at the costa mesa best buy today and will not be able to make to the in store this coming sunday. oh well, i'm going to wake up at the crack of dawn to see my ash-ash on seacrest a week from today.

      its been a mean while, since i’ve sat down and wrote an epic. perhaps, i’ve become too consumed with partying with jessica alba, rachel bilson, and recently fired hair stylist and overall fonzie wanna be, brandon from  urlLink “blow out” . my recent brush of fame as a political pundit for “on air with ryan seacrest”. a fleeting three minutes on a barely watched talk show unless you’re an eight year old girl with walls covered with pictures of clay aiken, can oddly enough open up alot of doors and land you alot of phone numbers. mandy moore’s number? got it. mischa barton? yup, i  called her about some michael caine i had and she was all stoked, but her her line partner in crime was in rehab for an eating disorder; so she wasn’t really excited to play unless creepy mccreeperson aka my boyfriend came (boo!). its like i told robin brown before he left for a film festival, “just build your buzz, kid” and i took my own advice, turning a two minute segment on a low rated show into something out of a jay-z video directed by hype williams. lines, chrissy, crack pipes, beer, and sexy designer sunglasses.   seriously, all maliboobs is a bunch of range rovers, beemers, and neon signs. newport is so much more sleazier.  dr jerry buss is fucking up  urlLink  the lakers . to quote bill phalscke, “its not the heat, its the stupidity”.  the canadian power duo, death from above has changed their name to urlLink  first to fight ;  pressure from the dfa record label and producing duo. i don’t know why people are flipping out like somebody who just saw  fahrenheit 9/11 . they’re still going to sound like death from above and you can still call them death from above, but when you go buy their album, it’ll be in the f section. not to mention, they’re gonna have the same push behind them that made the stills such a clear channel darling (don’t front, indie103 is a clear channel owned station). first to fight is still pretty tough and essentially, first to fight is fight music.  celebrity spotting: -kevin disco of everybody’s favorite purveyors of sass,  urlLink dance disaster movement  and 60 watt kid, was spotted at an undisclosed urban outfitters in the southern california area. he wasn’t buying clothes, he works there and has to listen to the killers all day, which can be a good or a bad thing, depending upon who you are. -oscar winning actress  urlLink marisa tomei  was slumming it on friday night at a bar in orange county with a hunky fire fighter. a friend of a friend refereed to tomei as “the girl from anger management” and not an oscar winner. -mischa barfin was spotted not once, but twice this past week. each time she was spotted, she had food in front of her, a salad. yet when pressed for questions, these people provided no answers to the pressing questions, “did she look like she was on the blow”.  ashlee simpson in store appearance in orange county on july 25th at the best buy in costa mesa. its gonna be me and like 400 teenaged girls, rad.

       urlLink pitbull 's video for his single, "culo," the latina big ass anthem of the summer has to have the worst video since bon jovi's  urlLink "bad medicine"  or at least its hip hop cousin. if you're gonna make a video for a song about big asses, then why not show big asses? walking by and seeing the hispanic jailbait across the street wash her car to this song would've been the best video ever.   addittionally, when they play "culo" on the radio, they don't say 'culo,' its just a whistle sound effect, yet on mtv, they do not censor the word. bizzare, bizzare.    the compromising of  urlLink jimmy kimmel  has started this past week. everything that made his show a train wreck, a very watchable and enjoyable trainwreck has been removed and now kimmel's slowly becoming a soul less jay leno wanna be. gone is his desk chat; replaced by a monlogue, where he stands. not to mention, the removal of the co host so many months ago. if abc wanted jay leno, then why don't they go after ed hall, former leno announcer.   urlLink defamer reports that soderbaugh was the one who fired ted griffin ; in other news, i've lost all respect for steven soderbaugh. first, he makes   urlLink full frontal  , then  urlLink  solaris   and marries  urlLink jules anser . sure  full frontal  was mildly excusable, and well, the less said about the boring mess known as  solaris  the best, but marrying jules anser has single handly ruined the e! channel, remember when she hosted 'wild on'?   urlLink a hot, really needy many moore type  has replaced  urlLink the frat house babe  on road rules 11: franzmania!

      i'm love in my new paul frank sweatshirt. its apart of the new fall line. i'd direct link it, but i want to get it on the low pro; yet here's the problem of purchasing a sweatshirt in the middle of august,  urlLink the weather just doesn't want to play pool with you . october can't come soon enough!   urlLink way to make your investment even more 'awful', if it all possible . rob reiner lost his edge a long, long, long time ago, not to mention an 'update' of   urlLink the graduate  . this film was destined to be a failure from the get go. yet here's the problem, they fire  urlLink ted griffin  for talking to his dp,  urlLink ed lachman  too much. i don't know, thats kind of a shitty reason to fire somebody and honestly, i'm looking at steven soderbaugh and george clooney, who are the producers of the film and wondering why didn't they defend their director or at least put up an effort to defend him. i don't know, i lost a bit of respect for them as producers.    urlLink scissor sisters + kylie = where was this collaboartion, like two years ago? although, if anything like that fischerspooner remix comes out of this collabo, i'm there with belles on.   urlLink some say 'girliest' tour of the fall; others say that not even the best ear plug known to man can prevent you from hearing all the screaming   since when did she have some boobs?    old news, but it has to be stated, that moving units album, "dangerous dreams" kinda not worth the wait, but "birds of prey" is excellent, its even better live, i went blind one time when they played it and got a bunch of riverside kids wet with my sweat during that one part where the song goes all crazy.    urlLink  collateral   is probably my favorite film of the year, so far. its the best performance ever done by the city of los angeles.

        everybody's surfin' *  cept brody cause he's totally stoned of his mind.  *=i stole this joke from robin 'hollywood' brown; he made it back in 2000.  although, upon further review of the photo, it just seems that anybody under the age of, oh, lets just say, 30 is really embrassed to be holding a giant surf board where as the 30 plus crowd is beyond stoked; they're even thinking of taking this board and going surfing the next morning, cause you know the waves are better in the morning.   its just like parents to embrass you.   urlLink "the oc" hits dvd in october  and it'll cost way too much for not a single rachel bilson or mischa barfin nip slip out takes.

        am i out of the loop on the cool, hip kids of orange county?  where are their blogs?   you know, nyc and l.a. are pretty much on lock down with all the cool kids writing about  urlLink lindsay lohan  and  urlLink the killers , but where oh where are the oc peeps?  perhaps its a case of wishful thinking on my behalf to believe all of the cool kids in the oc write blogs about going to the detroit bar or for whom was seen at the harbor house one night.   which brings me to the issue of was it really a good idea to delete my livejournal accounts and if you will, jump into the big leagues and the blogsphere. maybe thats where all of the cool kids are; on livejournal or my space.  so i'm just disapointed with the oc.  although, samarie armstrong is still hot [link via  urlLink ultragrrl ]    so i've listened to the  urlLink blood brothers  demos again. the songs are extremely visual and have a cinematic quality to them. its bizzare but i feel that the blood brothers have yet to fully realize their visual potential. so as a plea to their new label, v2, please get gondry, oliver gondry to direct a video, especially if the lead single is going to be the peacock song (track 4 on the demos).  it should be noted that the video for the blood brothers' "ambulance VS ambulance" is quite good and can be see  urlLink here    urlLink bort brilliance!  i heard this as an audio clip on stern the other day and peed my pants; i need to get this home box office channel post haste. [linkage kudos:  urlLink stereogum  &  urlLink thighswideshut ]   urlLink new jim jones dip set mix tape  starts placing your bets on whose gonna win the battle between money ma$e and the dip'set.

      my dog is trying her darnest to be like a regular person because in the wee hours of the night, when the rest of the house hold was asleep, she peed in front of my bathroom.  you see, she made the effort to go to the bathroom in front of a bathroom; it almost makes me want to believe she's capable of using a toliet, if training a dog to use the toliet is humanly possible, which i highly doubt.    urlLink some say best stern ever , this morning. i nearly lost it on the freeway, this morning.   urlLink the listmakers for the 2004 shortlist of music have been announced . i'm sorry but what do the following people know about good music:  urlLink the dixie chicks ,  urlLink john mayer ,  urlLink will-i-am of the black eyed peas , and  urlLink dashboard confessional . look to see what la's answer to the strokes and my go to joke band,  urlLink maroon5  at the top of john mayer's list! what happened  urlLink nic harcourt ? you used to let really cool people like spike jonze and the neptunes vote, now it seems like anybody whose ever picked up a guitar and wrote a really shitty ballad can vote this year. although, why does it even matter because a)this is just a bastardize version of the mercury awards and secondly, nobody cares about the shortlist. besides, doesn't everybody know that loretta lynn's album is gonna probably win the whole thing.   urlLink i want a le tigre ringtone  for  urlLink my sexy phone    urlLink josie maran  on the cone zone this week and they've brought back  urlLink the "walker, texas ranger" lever .    and how do you have an   urlLink alien Vs predator   film without it being rated r? isn't this supposed to be the cinematic end all battle or will that be the sequel? whatevs, i don't think anybody'll see anyways.   urlLink dip'set mix tape! dip'set mix tape!

        on the blood brothers demos from their latest album, "crimes," johnny, the co vocalist comes off sounding like a angry 13 year old girl or you wonder if he's become  urlLink castrated .  only one can imagine if the heavily traded blood brothers demos will become something of legend in a few years alal  urlLink the brian wilson smile sessions . oh if they put this song on the album, it would've been a million times better. yet i highly doubt that the blood brothers will achieve the depths of pop greatness that brian wilson came so, so, so close to.  yet here's the thing, with "crimes" its perhaps the least hardcore sounding the blood brothers have ever been. so hopefully, hopefully, no more tours with bullshit bands with stupid names like, "the tears taste like revenage" or "the lonely grave of paula schultz". its a hodepodge of styles, and frankly, they should put all 19 songs on the album and not wielded it down to 13. be bold and pretenious, that's what 2004 is all about.

         urlLink ebert's review of  the village   perfectly sums up my thoughts on the film.  if anything, it just feels that shyamalan has been on a downward spiral since his vastly unapperciated gem,  urlLink  unbreakable  . although partially, its our own fault, the audience's fault. we've grown accustomed to surprise endings to each of shyamalan's films and if he fails to deliever that desired twist, his film is a failure.   the sunday l.a. times ran a brief article about the latest and much  needed  dan the automator & prince paul team up, handsome boy modeling school presents "white people's album". it should be out on november 9th and will feature apperances by: -alex kapranos of franz ferdinand -cat power -barington levy -del tha funkee homosapien -john oates of hall & oates -jack johnson -the rza -the mars volta -jamie cullen -chino of the deftones -kid koala -linkin park -de la soul -tim meadows  prince paul had  an excellent quote about turning people away, "it's like getting into studio 54 back in the 70s. we had to look out there-'you're good. you're good. the rest of you come back and try next year."     urlLink keira knightley + tony scott + a script by richard ' donnie darko ' kelly = finally a keira knightley film i won't be embrassed to watch; maybe a bit of nudity, since they say she's cool with it.   urlLink nme says that badly drawn boy will be back in town in october . the last time i saw bdb in la, i swear to goodness that a certain  urlLink actress  totally checked me & hollywood brown out; then the  urlLink time  before that, well it was  the best in store ever    urlLink the cover for the blood brothers' "crimes" and their new bio . october can't come soon enough. we got new blood brothers, which to me, sounds heavily influenced by  urlLink death from above , and death from above's full length finally comes out in october, too.
