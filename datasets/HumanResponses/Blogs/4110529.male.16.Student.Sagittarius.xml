      Moral and Ethical Quandary: Appropriate response to recognizing an underage purchaser of alcohol.  While bagging groceries one day I saw a two young men approach a nearby register with a cart full of variously sized cases of beer.  One had a sort of ageless look: he could have been 18, he could have been 25.  He wore clothing very appropriate to the grunge scene, including an ugly flannel shirt, ripped off shorts, calf length black socks, and sneakers.  He also had a gross ponytail.  The other I recognized as having been in the same grade as the aforementioned pear-shaped lad  at my old school.  This boy could not have been older than a very recent nineteen.  As per regulations that we cashiers begrudgingly fill, their cashier took an ID, which checked out, and let them purchase a staggering amount of beer.  After they had left, I asked what the ID had said.  According to the cashier, 1970.  I thought that it was a bit of a stretch, and that nobody would claim to be 34 who was underage, but then maybe that was the angle that the grungy, ugly one had taken.  In any case, it was painfully obvious that they were arranging some sort of bacchanalia, in which the one who was under-age (of whose acquaintance I informed the cashier in question) was certainly going to partake.  I wish them well regardless.  I doubt that he even recognized me.  Soldier on, dude with the beer.  Fake ID Immunity Little secret: Store policy is that we sell if you have some kind of driver's license.  Way out of state? Cool.  No decals?  Aight.  Hard credit-card-like plastic? Not a problem.  If it has a state on it, and the DOB is 21 years ago, you can have whatever you want.  I was working the Express aisle with my manager bagging for me, and a kid came through looking to buy a six-pack.  I carded him, and he produced a Delaware license that put him at 22 years of age.  However, the young gentleman had not placed his real license or permit behind another card, rather he had just placed it, turned over, in one of the credit card slots, allowing me to see its color (pink, the color of New York licenses) and a barcode of the type that is unique to driver's licenses and learners permits.  Did I point it out to him?  Did I ask him trivia about Delaware?  Did I refuse him the beer.  Nope.  I let him purchase it, asking, as I made change, what he was doing in New York.  "Visiting Family" was his reply, and my manager grinned for the whole transaction.  I saw him in the store a few days later, perusing the newspaper rack as he undoubtedly worked up the courage to again buy beer, as I was walking outside to make a phone call on my break.  I thought about counciling him on the finer points of making a decent attempt to credibly buy beer, but I concluded that doing so would strain our tacit agreement, and send me into the realm of liability.  Besides, he didn't deserve to know.

      Toad Shaped bitch We cashiers resent all customers.  To us, you are a nuisance if you have any more than ten items.  Our pay is directly not linked to the performance of the store, so we operate at a total remove from the customers.  So when a customer buys over two hundred dollars worth of groceries, we tend to view that as a hostile affront, a veritable attack aimed directly at us, for the sole purpose of inconveniencing us.  In my second or third week of cashier work a customer came to the till who will remain burned into my memory and composite sentences  sempiternally.  She was about five feet five inches tall, but, due to her approximate two hundred fifty pounds of disgusting fat, leaned on the shopping cart so as to support her weight, much as apatosaur's would, some paleontologists hypothesize, dwell in deep swamps and marshes so that the water could support their terrific bulk.  She was sped like a toad, with a sort of fat neck that continued at the width of her jaw until it reached her shoulders, resembling the air sac with which frogs vocalize.  Her mouth was a weird wide shape, and her most unfortunate shade of lipstick did nothing to alleviate her ugliness.  To counterbalance the immense weight that she fas forcing upon the handlebar of the cart, she had loaded the interior with groceries until her enormous pile extended above the top of the cart, so that she looked like a tugboat pushing a garbage barge.  She had the most interesting choices in food; she purchased a number of low carbohydrate sodas and artificially sweetened products, which led me to believe that she was diabetic, a notion supported by her fantastic girth.  She also bought multiple cakes, which lead me to believe that she is of the class of diabetic that fill make few healthy changes to her lifestyle, opting instead to take massive doses of insulin and continue with the behaviors that led to her diabetes in the first place (assuming that she is in fact diabetic).  Sh also bought a number of ugly china plates of the type that we in the supermarket sell for less than $2 per.  They are a panoply of dull and dark hues, not at all conducive to pleasurable eating, yet she bought them.  I have never seen another customer buy those plates.  The rest of her groceries she wanted in plastic which, while convenient for the bagger in terms of time spent opening bags, hold very little in comparison to paper, and do not hold the groceries in any pattern.  As such, the groceries in her cart, as I scanned,  were in exactly the same state as they were before she put them on the conveyor belt.  This Brobdingnagian human beanbag chair had brought three of her own plastic bags with her, which provide a total refund of fifteen cents.  My bagger, without showing the slightest emotion at her suggestion that he use these crinkled, time consuming bags, obliged her.  She made sure to ask me if I had refunded her for the bags before she left.  When the entire transaction was said and done, she had purchased over $350 of groceries, a number that most cashiers would associate with Christmas eve dinner, thanksgiving, or Seder.  The groceries occupied two carts, whose steel frames with right angles were powerless to give shape to the piles of groceries within, which fit their purchaser so aptly.  As she had two carts, my bagger wheeled one to her car and helped her to unload the groceries.  She tipped him with one dollar. One Fucking Dollar. Because this stingy, gargantuan, bufiform excuse for a human being had a store discount card, I was able to look at the journal paper inside of the register and discover that she is the mother of a pear shaped boy a few years older than me at my old school.  This son of hers inherited her propensity for weight gain, and as such bore, when I knew him, a more  than passing resemblance to the man-child son of the woman whom Yosemite Sam periodically tried to marry in old Loony-Toons episodes so as to gain her inheritance.  Like a pear with legs, he had narrow, weak shoulders, from which rose a double chin of a neck and a fat face that one would think incapable of expression, which was too often the case.  His legs were fat at the thigh, with no power, with skinny calves.  In short, he was fat in a way that made him terrible at football.  The paterfamilias of this unfortunate clan is a liability lawyer specializing in cases where an obstetrician is accused of, through negligence in delivery, causing birth defects which very well may have occurred without any help from the doctor.  This cow of a woman came back about two week later, and bought over $400 of groceries.  She arrived at the checkout at thirteen minutes to closing and was in her car with her groceries five minutes after closing.  Her purchases included a new stack of plates which she asked be bagged in paper with folded bags between each.  Although I did not participate in the transaction, I still shudder to think of her, and dread ever having to serve her.  This time, after a different coworker of mine had bagged her groceries and helped her load both carts full into her car, she tipped him two dollars.  Frau Farbinse and the Rebates from Hell Once, when I was running the express aisle, a German or Slavic sounding woman came buying two separate orders, one consisting of what I assumed to be groceries specified buy some employer and the other of two slices of cheesecake from the in-store bakery.  Her iterative insistence that the two orders were separate bordered on annoying.  In her first order she presented a slip with an amount, a department, and an initial on it.  I thought that it was a bill and rang it up as such.  She payed with a check which she retrieved from an envelope, not a book, thereof, and proceeded to review the receipt.  As she was reading through the reciept in the most popular mode, holding it as though it were a scroll and muttering under her breath, I rang up the cheesecake.  Upon realizing that I had rung up as a bill what had really been a refund, she immediately flew into hysterics.  I  voided the cheesecake because I surmised that it should be separate from the refund, and refunded twice the value on the slip, the extra time accounting for my having charged her the original amount once.  The refunds are no mean feat, as they amount to voiding a purchase that never took place with that register, and thusly require a manager override for each one.   The manager leaves copies of the manager key in all of the cashier keyboards, so at least i didn't have to call anyone over from the courtesy desk, however the “void-8-quantity-amount-grocery-clear-turn the key-override-code-enter-turn the key-repeat” sequence is time consuming and prone to mistake and annoying noises from the machine.  I gave this woman her receipt and cash and rang up the cheesecake, however she was not yet finished.  She wanted to know why the cheesecake was on the same receipt as the refund.  I tried to explain to her that the minus sign after the price denoted a void, which made the net charge for the cheesecake zero, however she was not to be appeased so easily.  She reiterated that she had wanted the two orders separate, and was immune to my explanation, instead mindlessly repeating in her staccato fashion "tze-pe-ret".  After several minutes during which I contemplated just writing a new reciept by hand, she, without warning, suddenly comprehended what I was saying, and just had me write “refund” on the original receipt next to the charge for the rebate amount. I recuperated thanks to a dearth of customers for the rest of the day, but was nonetheless shaken.  Maybe she didn't want anyone to see that she had bought the cheesecake.

      To Spanish, or not to Spanish? Every day starting before I arrive at noon and continuing until about one o'clock, myriad day laborers arrive to buy our overly priced lunches.  I usually speak to them in English, as they all have at least a very functional vocabulary specific to a few things, including buying lunch.  There are certain assumptions that one must make for them, including that they will want small a brown bag for their forties and a paper bag to put the six pack in, and, since the whole exercise is so very routine and rote, the exchange is usually not noteworthy.  Today, however, a customer of the hispanic persuasion bought lunch and, upon my giving him the change thanked me with "Gracias."  I responded reflexively with "De nada", and thought nothing of my choice of language, polyglot that I am.  However, I mentioned the exchange to a colleague from Spain whom, do to his fair features, customers not at all unlike the one with whom I had earlier exchanged call "Gringo."  So now I wonder if I was being a condescending jerkface when I said that.  Comment time!  Returns Ladies and Gentlemen of this beautiful country of ours, I stress to you that if you do not intend to purchase something, please, please, please do not take it to the checkout counter with you.  I know that you thought that the milk was sour before you picked it up to put it on the belt, and I know that you had no intention of buying you child the "Finding Nemo" sippy cup, and I know that you had checked how much money you had with you and had heard of sales tax before you came in, and that you already knew how expensive the grocery store where I work is, so why can you not take the forty five seconds to put it back where you found it.  None of the cashiers really shop at this supermarket; it's too expensive.  We shop at Shop Right, Stop & Shop, or The Grand Union.  We don't know where to find the things you picked up and dropped in the returns bin like an unwanted baby on a church step.  So I, with my very limited and not at all specific knowledge of the store layout, nonsensical signs and very contrived and bizarre distinctions between genres of grocery items, set out to return a full cart full of rejects.  The character of the rejected item is, usually, not that of the staple item that you actually write down on your shopping list.  It is unnecessary and thus to be found at the very bottom or top of a shelf, or on the ends of the aisles, or some such.  The quest lasted over an hour, as I have been historically bad at seeing what I am looking for in plain sight.  Another way to consider the plight of the returner is to consider how long it would take you, knowing where you found the item, to replace it, add time it would take the poor, doe-eyed clerk to find its place, and multiply it by about fifty.  That's how much I hate you, you lazy, inconsiderate fool.

      Inane Question du Jour I began today what I hope will become a tradition in my remaining career as a clerk, which was posting the Inane Question du Jour, which was "Is a female chipmunk a chipnun?" on the keyboard stand of a fellow cashier.  I witnessed a number of customers go by and their reactions, which ranged from "[Legit belly laugh] that's really funny!" to "Heh Heh..." to "You spell monk with an 'O', you know!"  Thanks, dude, I guess you're some kind of humorless, pedantic jerkface then?  Clearly there is a demonstrable and obvious difference in the pronunciation of the two words, but that can be easily excused in appreciating the pun.  Just a gut reaction.  C'mon folks, I know that it's not any kind of 'A' material, but you don't have to be a twat about it.  At least don't fuel the gossip fire that we re-kindle upon your leaving, receipt in hand.  At least that one little piece of paper made some people laugh.  As a cashier, I have the power to make your day so much better with my minor funny additions to your shopping experience, and you don't even realize it.  Mooching Jerkface Although the majority of the cashiers is under 18, the majority are smokers.  Today a certain other cashier, taking his allotted 10 minute cigarette break stuck his hand out with an air of expectation--entitlement even--to a fellow bagger (cashiers and baggers and interchangeable at this store) so as to bum a smoke.  Jerkface.  Cigarettes=money, and when a packet of cigarettes is worth more than an hour of work, you might want to think twice about asking, unless you can definitely assure him of a purchased-but-absent compensation cigarette.  Don't be that guy dude, just don't.  Wonder Boy Wonder Boy is the name I give to customer who has been something of a regular to the store recently.  Today he was wearing aviators, as per usual, and a head-to-toe Abercrombie and Fitch jumpsuit.  He first came in with his mother and they bought hamburger buns and some type of vegetable.  His manner and look screamed camp to me, but my gay-dar is so jammed in this day and age (curse you to hell, Details magazine).  I had him pegged for a fairy until he came into the store later, this time (the first time ever) sans sunglasses, accompanied by a not-to-bad-looking girl.  This new development in the vast anthropological pool from which all cashiers sample in their day-to-day is truly fascinating.  Keep aware of further updates.  A Fellow Employee vs. Jerkface from Out of Town. A bagger at the store is mentally handicapped, but in a minor way.  She is very sweet to all the kids who come through the store, usually asking them how school was during June and, as the summer progresses, asking them how camp was.  Some woman came in today with her daughter who looked to be between nine and eleven years old, to who my accomplice in check-out posed "How was day camp today?"  The girl replied that she does not go to camp, a totally legitimate response, but her mother appended "What camp?"  When my co-worker replied "The day camp at the park; in town," the girls mother replied "Oh, she doesn't go to camp here; we're from California.  Did you think that you recognized her."  Now, the posing of the question "How was camp today" does not need to be predicated on fellowship or even acquaintance with the object of the question.  My gregarious bagger was simply making the assumed leap to the assumption that the girl went to camp.  The supercilious tone that the customer took was so very unnecessary and hostile even.

      I would first like to apologize for the address of this blog.  I do not condone perversions of the English language, and do not subscribe to “hax0r” culture, nor do I suffer well its lexicon that consists entirely of contrived transliterations of the Latin alphabet.  However, the names "Perko" and "Perki," long my nicknames --albeit among two seperate peer groups-- were already taken by, respectively, a procrastinator and someone who hasn't posted since he got his up.  Dope.  Anyway, I hope that this will be a productive and worthwhile use of the space on Blogger's servers, and not some kind of homage to inane and crass humor of the type that pervades profiles, blogs, and firstclass resumes.  Anyway, I am tired as all hell after mon Tour de Ouestchester this afternoon, and have yet to master self governance in using the ill wifi setup which I set up recently in my house.
