      Your mind is reflective to the point of being chameleon-like. Why?  Because you think with your feelings and translate thoughts into something at the core of your being.  You don't just imitate, you become.  You have an artistic and very attenuated manner of communicating.  You have an openness and can incorporate several points of view.  You often see the humor in a situation and are good at expressing it.  You adjust to changes at a profound level.  You only need to be concerned about this if you find yourself becoming confused or lazy.  This is the sign that you are repressing your own insights while accepting someone else's.  Try to gain a detached look at your own drives when this happens **Horoscope** ZzSpOoKyZz Am i??

      You are the most sympathetic and self-sacrificing of souls.  You have a good imagination and good receptivity to others.  You have a poetic otherworldliness which can come out in some creative or idealistic channel.  You have a deep, emotional understanding of others and a real will to serve.  You need to be careful that you aren't so suggestible that you fall into self-pitying and avoidance behavior.  Try to develop concentration and discipline without losing your easygoing demeanor. Once you are determined to reach a goal, your faith in life, the universe and yourself can give you the strength of character to renounce anything that gets in the way. **Horoscope** ZzSpoOkYzZ   Am i??

       First thing first i HATE water sports LOLx(always  get drowned) ,second  I will NEVER go for yoga OR drugs(MayBe).*Often your creativity expresses itself in music or poetry.(i Hate Poetry n music)************ Yours is a dreamy and imaginative nature->true true(i Love to sleep)* u are highly receptive to other people's moods and emotions, and you can soak up an atmosphere like a sponge. Your acute sensitivity means that you have to find ways to protect yourself, or you end up constantly drained, put upon, or feeling paranoid.-->hell Yeah tats MI*  *Piscean lesson is to find your own identity rather than fitting yourself into other people's                                 ZzSpOoKyZz

      Pisces is the sign of the Two Fish, and it is a rare Piscean who does not feel a strong affinity with the sea.  You are likely to have a love of water sports - swimming, sailing, surfing or angling.  Yours is a dreamy and imaginative nature.  Often your creativity expresses itself in music or poetry.  You are highly receptive to other people's moods and emotions, and you can soak up an atmosphere like a sponge.  Your acute sensitivity means that you have to find ways to protect yourself, or you end up constantly drained, put upon, or feeling paranoid.  There is a risk of making too many sacrifices in your life.  Part of the Piscean lesson is to find your own identity rather than fitting yourself into other people's moulds.  Escapism is a characteristic of your sign, and Pisceans have to be careful when seeking altered states of consciousness through either alcohol or drugs.  Relaxation techniques such as Yoga or meditation are a safer bet!  Love and compassion are extremely important to you, but you have to temper your romantic ideals with some realism.

      A Pisces cannot live without lies and treachery. They often get so wrapped up in their own tall tales that they can easily forget which of their stories are true and which are not. A Pisces constantly contradicts herself, and is always trying to wriggle out of a lie somebody has called her on. She will generally not profit from such fruitless tasks, but that's fine by her - she's doing it for the art. Additionally a Pisces loves nothing more than to stick her nose into someone else's dirty laundry. Pretending to be a self-taught psychoanalyst she will pry into people's secrets, which she will later manipulate and trade through her own self-styled network of spies. Incapable of working, or for that matter doing anything remotely useful, a Pisces has no interest for aquiring such abilities. Forcing her to do so is nearly impossible - she will simply wriggle out and disappear.                                       ZzSpoOkYzZ Am I????
