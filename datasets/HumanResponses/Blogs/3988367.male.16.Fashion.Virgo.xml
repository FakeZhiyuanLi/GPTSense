						   Alright. The results are in. I slept, i dreamt, and I got some more on the Elkanah the Leprechaun/Mariana Trench case. Last night in my dream, I actually went to the Mariana Trench. I swam very deep, and the pressure did not seem to effect me. I was clad in scuba gear. There were school of fish everywhere. When I say scuba gear, I mean Rayden from Mortal Kombat. I do not get it, I looked like Rayden, the God of thunder. I don't understand this at all... Is he a key to unlocking this mystery? I (Rayden) swam very, very deep down into the Mariana Trench. I don't know what exactly I saw, but it looked to be a Skyscraper, with small lights off in the distance. The lights seemed to spell out the word  'Manuela'.  I researched this word, and to my dismay it meant God is with us. I then got a sudden burst of energy and got out of there, and shot off to head for Antarctica, not knowing what I would find. I will find out when I dream tonight. I wrote a rhyme about my dream last night.    Rayden send me the faith via lightning bolt Rayden ride to Antarctica via lightning bolt I sing this acapella For the one and only Manuella The school of fish who have da damn game tamed The holy Lord tried to tell me da rap game was ta' blame What's the meaning of this place I call Atlantis Is Jesus located here? Is this where he prances? Step to the back and the front and do the Jesus dance If you need someone to bless you with a miracle Jesus can MAN Jesus Jesus MAN What is the mystery? What do you want me to uncover, i'm just a Christian G'    urlLink    GET  ER  DONE  RAIDEN  urlLink

						   If only I could cross the Pacific Ocean on whaleback. I had a dream that a leprechaun was waiting for me on an iceburg in Antarctica. He had information about my shady childhood. I would have to set sail from Washington, California, or Alaska. The reasoning for this is because my dream tells me that something is to happen when I first start my journey. I do not know where to start, perhaps I need to dream some more. My dream is also trying to tell me something about the Mariana Trench. This is kind of out of the way from the path to Antarctica though. The Mariana Trench is located near Japan, and is the  deepest  location on Earth. I have a feeling this has something to do with the  deep  longing I feel for the arrival of my father this August. He is coming back to see me for the first time in 13 years. We'll talk about this in another flow. But I know, that I will set sail on whaleback, and find this mysterious leprechaun who has the word Elkanah branded on his forehead. I researched this name because it sounded familiar, it means  purchased by God.  There is a connection between the Mariana Trench and the name Teodosio, meaning  gift of God.  All of this kind of confuses me, BUT I still wrote a flow about it.  Check it out.     What lays in antartica remains unknown  I'm gonna travel by whaleback all alone  I need to regenerate faith like I was an iguana  Show me my childhood my mysterious Elkanah  The Mariana Trench is so damn deep  Oh, Teodosio what kind of gift do you preach?  I hope when I arrive for the loveliest sermon  This whole dream sequence has got my insides churnin  Burnin  I need some truth  Leprechaun of justice are you my childhood sleuth?  Elkanah for what reason were you purchased?  Is this a sign of God's reemergence?        urlLink           -PEACE-

						   Today i realized what chickenheads girls can be. All they do is walk around bawk bawkin. They have to be useful in some way. BUT THEY'RE NOT! But anyways, I wrote a rhyme about it. This is my first post, you guys are going to notice that I express my emotions through making rhymes. So check this one out.      Man, these girls always walk up and be like bawk bawk bawk   It's surprisin' to me because i'm the lady hawk   Girls have imaginary beaks   They peck at you and step on your feet   Chickenheads always think they run the game   They think they change the man but the man stays the same   Us men? we gotta stick together   Instead of seein' a chickenhead and chasin after their feathers   A guy like messin wit' a chicken dat's silly  I don't front with chickens, and dat's da dilly            I'll keep posting whenever I have a new rhyme. If you liked it playa stay up! If you didn't .. That's too bad, because i'm going to be the first rapping president.

						   This is the final dream I had, I know it. This might shock some people. But believe me when I say this: God is a mad man. Alright, that man I saw, was not really god. It was Cyrax from mortal kombat. When I arrived he was killing all the penguins. And the Leprechaun was really Jason Biggs. They were killing penguins. It was terrible. I had a disposable camera, and I took a picture. I must go there, and stop them from killing the penguins.    urlLink     That was the most horrible thing i've ever seen. I wrote a rhyme:   Cyrax why you wanna kill all them birds?/ To me this plan seems really obserd ya urd?/ Jason Biggs, Why you gotta hurt them ducks?/ You gotta knife in that birds belly, what the bluck?/ Killin Penguins is a felony in the place I call Earth/ I don't like you killin' God's creatures on God's turf/ When I get to antarctica i'm gonna cream ya clocks!/ I'm gonna mush you up like a big ol' tater tot/

						   Ey yo, I ain't never had one of these before. What I saw this morning was a flat out miracle. I was havin a crummy day ya urd? All of the sudden I look to sky and I saw the biggest miracle of all time. All of my favorite people were looking down on me.    urlLink    Left to right: Larry the Cable Guy, Taco Bell dog, Babe Ruth, Fergface from Clarissa Explains it all, A Ralph Mouth doll (from Happy Days) Rod Stewart, and a man with no arms.  urlLink      I wrote a rhyme about that shit. It goes like this:   Nothing can wipe the tears out of my eyes/ Like the soft grip of Larry the Cable Guy/ I can't express my feelings for the Collossus of Clout/ And I can't get enough of that goofball Ralph Mouf'/ My man Rod Stewart's gotta lotta charm/ And I am so thankful that i've got both of my arms/ Fergface, I understand that clarissa's a trick/ Yo Quiero Taco Bell bro, pass me dat shit/
