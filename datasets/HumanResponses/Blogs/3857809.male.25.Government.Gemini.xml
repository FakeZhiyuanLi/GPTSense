      This blog will document, for myself, just what is going on over at fight4right.org  In July, we filed the paperwork necessary to form a 527.  That's a political organization that can support ideals, not people specifically.  (I'm learning the guidelines more and more every day.  I thought you couldn't say, "defeat" but  urlLink www.defeatbush.org  would be in violation.)   urlLink www.moveon.org  and  urlLink www.emilyslist.org  are two organizations utilizing a variety of legal nuances to exist, and do all that they do.  What I want to do is provide a place where people who share my beliefs can go to find candidates who do as well.  Where those people can find ways to support those ideas.  Paperwork was filed.  Then, I called in a favor from an old friend, Sabrina.  She couldn't shoulder the lode, so...she passed it to a friend of hers, and acquaintance of mine, Lee.  He has done a tremendous job creating logos, letterhead, and our website.  Lee has been invaluable in moving this forward.  Previously I've been posting on my personal webblog,  urlLink www.wade_eyerly.blogspot.com  but I think it's time that I had a little something for  urlLink www.fight4right.org  so here it is.  I'll keep you(that means ME) posted on just what is happening.  I'll use this to organize my thoughts, and push it forward.  -Wade

      So, the Vice President...yes that's capital letters, THE Vice President, the Dick Cheney lives in the Naval Observatory.&nbsp; I'd never been, but last Tuesday I was invited to a little dinner, a little bar-b-cue really out back of his house.&nbsp; So I went.&nbsp;   Now, I had a meeting already on Tuesday...in a special advisory capacity with the RNC.&nbsp; So, if you're LDS and political go to  urlLink www.ldsteamleader.com  thank you very much.&nbsp; Still dressed up, I bolted from my meeting early.&nbsp; The Vice President's stewards were grilling out hot dogs and burgers, and his grandkids were jumping into the pool.&nbsp; There were about 65 members of his staff just milling about, like an average office party, except...the Vice President might pop up behind you at your table to say, "thanks for everything you're doing.&nbsp; I really appreciate it."&nbsp; He's such a genuine guy.&nbsp; He paused mid thank you moment at one point to tell everyone about his granddaughters who were about to do a dive for the crowd&nbsp;into the pool.&nbsp; 5 year old's are so much fun.&nbsp;&nbsp; Grandma Cheney, that is...Mrs. Lynn Cheney spent the evening holding her new Grandson and proudly showing him off.&nbsp; Such, well, just a family.&nbsp; They are just like any other family.&nbsp; He has a great job, they work hard, and they like to play with their family, and they're thankful for what is done on their behalf, etc.  Lost a couple games of horse shoes to Kate Perry, a granddaughter.&nbsp; But you should have seen it.&nbsp; 4 sets of horseshoe games going...out on the lawn...by the pool house, of the VICE PRESIDENT's house.&nbsp; The image still cracks me up.&nbsp; Good times, good people.  I really love working on this campaign.

      So, I've been getting totally behind.&nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp; I travel for the Bush-Cheney campaign.&nbsp; I do Press Advance for Dick Cheney, so...if he's on the road, then so am I.&nbsp; 5 days ahead of him.&nbsp; Well...this last "interim" I was home, in D.C.&nbsp; Playing.&nbsp; And just didn't have the time or the access. See, my best friend, my girlfriend Maggie is in town.&nbsp; She lives in Honolulu, HI so having her in D.C. for a short time is a serious bonus.&nbsp;  This last week, then...I tried to make the most of it.&nbsp; See, we have some traditions, Monday night movies.&nbsp; We go out every Monday night and see a movie.&nbsp; The new releases came out either Friday or Wednesday the week before, and there's no lines, no people hardly, and well...it's just us.&nbsp; So, Monday night we saw a movie.&nbsp; I can't even remember what.&nbsp;   Wednesday we woke up and it was just TOO early, so...back to sleep.&nbsp; Maggie came over super early, and couldn't fall asleep so she went for a drive, then she came home and passed out.&nbsp; I mean for real.&nbsp; I woke up at 10:30, and since no one likes to be harshly woken up, I tried a kiss, a soft "Mags" whispered in the ear, anything...nada.&nbsp; 11:30, I tried again.&nbsp; 12:30, finally at 1:30 I told her "Hey...if you don't get up now, you're gonna have an "I slept too long headache, and you're gonna be hating yourself tonight."&nbsp; 20 minutes of coersion later, she crept off the couch.&nbsp; I had been able to get quite a bit done for  urlLink www.fightforright.org  my newest political project.&nbsp; But, the rest of my day, and my time, once she's awake is devoted to her, so...  Off we went to a Waterpark.&nbsp; Now, it took some coaxing.&nbsp; Which I didn't really understand, I mean this girl is a fish.&nbsp; She moved to Hawaii, works a few hours a day with Autistic kids, then surfs like 6 hours a day, or plays on the beach...or whatever it is that Kama'ina(sp?) do.&nbsp; She's living the North Shore dream.&nbsp; So you'd think, water, fun.&nbsp; She goes to the pool just about every day, and can't get enough of it.&nbsp; She's not a fish, she's a shark for crying out loud, but...no...the Waterpark was a tough sell.&nbsp; It'll be fun, you'll see.&nbsp; We got there after 4, so...it was only like 6&nbsp; bucks, we rode all the rides, even the kiddie ones where other "grown ups" laughed at us.&nbsp; We just romped in the water, in the wave pool, down the slides, it was a blast.&nbsp;   So the next day, even more fun.&nbsp; Maggie had got a line on some "Mystery Shopping." But it was in Philadelphia, or actually...at banks in all the&nbsp;little&nbsp;Pennsylvania towns north of Philadelphia.&nbsp; Great fun little towns.&nbsp; 12 banks in one day.&nbsp; We rented a convertible and cruised on up.&nbsp; Such an adventure.&nbsp; One of us would go in and mystery shop while the other wrote the report on the last stop on the&nbsp;lap top in the car.&nbsp; Top&nbsp;down, cruising through Penny, just having fun.&nbsp; 6:00, last bank&nbsp;was done, we headed to downtown Philly and just cruised the streets.&nbsp; If only our Chrysler Sebring Convertible had&nbsp;spinners on 20" rims.&nbsp;   Friday, how could&nbsp;Friday top the past two.&nbsp; Well, two words.&nbsp; Horseback Riding.&nbsp; I, I must say, was a natural.&nbsp; But, that's to be expected.&nbsp; She, however...was more cowgirl than I'd have imagined.&nbsp; She&nbsp;hopped on this diminutive horse with an attitude, and&nbsp;trotted out to these huge open fields.&nbsp; I followed on this GIANT steed of a horse.&nbsp; I dwarfed her, but...felt like a man.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; I can't admit&nbsp;that?&nbsp; Whatever, I felt like the man.&nbsp; I let out a "He'Ya!" and kicked a bit...off Jeb (my horse was named for a certain&nbsp;Florida Governor) went.&nbsp; We ran through creekbeds, muddy shallows, open fields, forest, all kinds of places.&nbsp; It was great.&nbsp;   When we came home it was clear that the day wasn't&nbsp;over.&nbsp; We spent some time editing&nbsp;photos (3 things put a smile on Maggie's face...by smile I mean...light up the room grin.&nbsp; Horseback&nbsp;riding, editing photos and playing pranks.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggie is like a little girl with a new doll when she sits down to her laptop, that she faithfully totes&nbsp;everywhere, and photoshopped the begeebees out of&nbsp;our pictures from the past couple days.&nbsp; I'll try to post them later.  After the photo editing session, we went to see the Bourne Supremacy, which she loved.&nbsp; I thought it was good, too...but I always like movies better when she really enjoys them.&nbsp; The theatre was packed, it was opening night, and&nbsp;our&nbsp;crowd clapped at the end of&nbsp;"The" fight scene, "the" chase scene, and the end.&nbsp; Good movie, good times.&nbsp; But what are we going to see on Monday?&nbsp; Who knows.&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Got home from Minneapolis, where basically I had to be a miracle worker.&nbsp; Our whole team did.&nbsp; We were pulling an entire rally together for the VP in 5 hours.&nbsp; It was great though...even introduced a couple new elements...like a slide show, with all kinds of pictures of the VP in relaxed comfortable environs.&nbsp; I mean...he's such a family man, such a sportsman, and everyone always thinks he's this gruff...hawk.&nbsp; He's a guy who wants to go fishing, enjoy time with his family.&nbsp; Anyway, I'm not a spokesman.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I'm back now...and shopping for some new eyewear.&nbsp; See...eyewear have become trendy since I bought my last pair in 2000, and it's time for a step up.&nbsp; Off I go.

      ...  After a few days spent "on the couch" of a friend of a friend, I began house-sitting. Watering plants for rent was the surest way to stretch my $200. Food and the Metro Bus were the only things costing me money now, and the house I was living in was loaded with food...8 weeks later, still unemployed and without much on the rise, my $200 was tapped out. Gone. I had nothing.   ...Now, I was relying on the Lord to provide, as I felt He wanted me in D.C.  Before I moved the big decision was based on what I felt.  I must have asked the Lord 20 times what he wanted me to do when I graduated, and I never got any answer other than, "Move to D.C." or "Haven't I already told you??!?"  So, when I was still questioning and continued to get the "Move to D.C." answer to my prayers, I finally said "Fine, you get me there, I'll go."   And, when I prayed and felt that answer, I said to the Lord, "I don't know how I can make this happen, so...this is in your hands.  This is what you want, I'll do it.  Take care of me," after which I was reminded that the Lord of Hosts is aware of the birds in the sky and fish in the Sea, surely he'll remember me.  We've already heard about the move...and now...  So...I was tapped out. I had less than five dollars left, and a new acquaintance approached me and offered, "Why don't you move into my place?"  I responded explainging my financial situation and that I had neither job, nor money...so, in short, I couldn't afford it.  He said he'd "cover it" until I was on my feet, and that I could get him back.  Now, I avoid debt like the plague, but...this seemed heaven sent, so..I took him up on it.  But...I still had about a week left on my house-sitting gig before I could move.  So...I'd be there in a week.  Still strapped for cash, but now with a place to go after what I thought would be the end of my rent-free days I still felt so broke that it churned my stomach.  You know, the worry, the uncertainty...etc.  I had confidence that the Lord wasn't going to let me, you know, starve...but I couldn't see it yet.  I hid my worry in scripture reading.  From where I was staying the busses only ran during rush hour, so...I was writing a political column for  urlLink politixgroup  every other day, and riding into the city on the off days to interview.  I'd have an interview at 10:30, so...I'm in at 8, metro to Union Station, and I'd sit in the park between the station and the Capitol, and I'd read.  I'd read my scripturs for about 2 hours, then...go to my interview/s, and return to the park, for more reading.  I lost myself in those scriptures, and it became a pinnacle of knowledge and confidence in the hand of the Lord.  I constantly reminded myself that the Lord wanted me here, and wouldn't let me fall by the wayside.   At church that Sunday I met a guy who needed to rent a room for a week.  He offered 50 bucks, for the room that I wasn't going to be using with that new friend.  I had cash again...enough to eat...to keep using Metrobus...to keep interviewing...to keep on keeping on.  Once again, the Lord had come through for me...   urlLink The 3 article series that I wrote during this time was reprinted a few weeks ago and can be found here

      I travel for a living...so my circumstances are never circumspect.  In fact, they're often suspect.  At the moment I'm in Minnesota, and from the lofty perches of the glorious "St. Paul" hotel, they want 9 bucks a night for internet access.  Well...I'm not about to give them that...so I have to do all of my work in the "staff office."  Not that I am not thankful to have it.   Anyway, thought I'd drop a note as though someone actually read this...and explain my lack of posts.

      Ok, so I figured out how to post photos, and since I was worried I'd never get it right again...I posted some back-to-back.  Now you know what I look like.  Moving right along,  I am working on a treatment.  I hear that they are both worthless, and necessary for someone to pitch a TV show...and well, I've got a great idea.  I've flushed it out with some friends, and maybe you'd like to tell me what you think.  There are a lot of news shows out there. 60 minutes, Nightline, Dateline, Nightlynews, local news, and then EVERYTHING on cable.  CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, etc.  But in the whole realm of news shows...somehow every member of the television pantheon has failed to target a key demographic...the one I identify with.  Young guns.  The generation that is not quite X.  Those of us 25-35 living in America, working our first jobs, etc.  When I hear about Medicare, I tune right out.  No one has ever explained how Medicare legislation effects ME.  Welfare?  I don't need it.  I spent the last year unemployed, and eligible for unemployment benefits, but I didn't take them.  So do I believe you could?  Maybe not...but do I want to pay more taxes so that you don't have to find out?  No.  We pay enough.  There are enough parachutes catching us when we fall, if someone doesn't let the chick peck its way out of its own eggs, we'll end up a generation of weak unappreciative victims.  Wait...does that describe the trend of America?  It might.  But why does the NEWS not tell me what's important to me?  Or my peers?  Did they really think that getting John McEnroe to host a news show would grab my attention?  How about a show called Young Guns?  Something where we can get a panel of 3 or 4 good, young, up and comers and talk, ala the "View", about issues that effect us.  Talk about current events.  What does the war in Iraq mean to 25-35 year olds?  Well...we're the one's dying.  So why not talk to US about it?  There are 40 million Americans in that demographic and not one cable news show can get 2 million viewers.  So to complete my rant, it's time to stop calling us the MTV generation...and treat us like adults.  We're ready for it.  Let's hear it.  So, that's basis of the idea.  Not really articulate, but none-the-less valid.  We need a news show for US.  So...I'll pitch one.  A buddy of mine, Tyler has done some great work with statistics and putting together a presentation, and we're both now working up some treatments.  So that we have a couple variations on the show for when we pitch it.  Nice eh?

      I have got to find a new, more engaging way to title these posts.  So, I had an eventful day yesterday, I want to discuss some things that need some "working on," a.k.a. my to do list, and continue yesterday's story.  To start, I went to visit an old friend.  Actually, she and I dated a couple years ago.  Then she went on an LDS mission, and now she's returned.  I never thought I'd be around to see the day.  So, I went to visit.  I was a little uncomfortable, a little worried about expectations, or what she would say.  We'd talked on the phone once or twice, and I just...don't know how to relate to her just now.  So, I was worried it would be odd.  I got there, and she was alone.  We sat on a couch in opposite corners, each declaring his/her comfort zone as large as possible.  I found myself holding a giant pillow in my lap...noticed it, thought "Ridiculous!" and set it down...between the two of us.  So, yes...the "distance" was palpable.  After a few minutes of forced idle banter I settled into a "me" I hadn't seen in quite some time.  I was the entertainer.  I remembered her laugh, that hadn't changed.  Almost instinctively then I remembered who I was to her.  I cracked jokes.  I was ambitious, and I was funny.  I said off the wall things, and I was the center of attention because I had to be.  And..I became that.  It's not that I didn't like it, but...I didn't like it.  But, it  was  comfortable.  It was like part of me that I hadn't seen in a while.  Only, edited.  I was cleaner, but still funny.  I was less frat boy, and more White House.  Her mom came home, she remembered the most random details about me...and about my time with Emily.  Her now 11 year old sister remembered me.  Remembered that we went camping together and I slept alone.  That I said I couldn't build tents, so that I wouldn't have to.  That I cracked some ludicrous joke about it.  And again, I was back to being Wade the entertainer.  Her car was dead in her driveway, so I offered to help fix it.  Turns out, I don't know anything about cars, but since I'm a guy...I had to try.  I hand checked every fuse in the box.  Even replaced one bad one...but still couldn't get it to go.  Eventually I was starving and headed out.  Kind of relieved to have the obligatory grip and grin out of the way, but...I was strangely perplexed at how quickly I reverted into someone I wasn't.  How I became the person that I was in front of them.  Do I put on a lot of shows?   Am I someone different in every crowd?  At the core I am me, but who is that?  I know who it is, but does anyeone else?  Do I let them see?    So, it was an interesting morning.

      It's morning, so...not a whole lot has happened, but I wanted to get down some of the outline for "My Year on the couch for Bush Cheney."    In July of 2002 I moved to D.C. with the wild-eyed idea of making something of myself.  I am an average guy, 6' tall, skinnier than most, straight-but well dressed, and broke.  I am a blue-eyed republican, meaning I am a conservative, who is liberal enough about some things to cross over to the other side on some issues. I'm enough of an idealist to believe that I can make a difference and not so much so that I can ignore common sense.  In fact I pride myself on having a "common sense politic."  So, armed with that, a recently graduated 23 year old mind, and the last $200 from my checking account I hitched a ride with my brother, David (who was touring all the six flags' in the U.S.) to Chicago, from my native Kansas City, MO, and from Chicago with my cousin Sarah.  She was moving to D.C. to teach, noble person that she is!  After a few days spent "on the couch" of a friend of a friend, I began house-sitting.  Watering plants for rent was the surest way to stretch my $200.  Food and the Metro Bus were the only things costing me money now, and the house I was living in was loaded with food...8 weeks later, still unemployed and without much on the rise, my $200 was tapped out.  Gone.  I had nothing.

      Well...I can't quite figure out why my page looks great on the preview, but won't post.  Now, I have an ingenious roommate, Drew Cutler.  He originally pointed me to Hugh Hewitt's book, so...he's been blogging for sometime.  I'll look to him today to troubleshoot.    My best friend, Maggie moved into a new house today, and so I spent the day trimming Ivy, cutting the hedges, and taking care of some basic gardening...since it hadn't been done since the Mayans occupied her house.  I got a new logo for Fight for Right that is incredible.  I'm thrilled with it, Golden plates, Statue of Moroni, and Patriotic flag.  Perfect for a group that is looking to support LDS candidates, and other value based candidates for office.  See, the world is replete with Moveon.org-type angry protesting "we don't like you're guy" type of special interests.  What the world needs more of is useful organizations the promote character and values.  So, Fightforright.org will work like Emily's list works (though with very different candidates) to support candidates and help to put people in office who have the moral fortitude to make the decisions that I would, were I in office.    Because THAT, is a representative government.

      Today is the 6th of July, 2004.  I'm just starting this blog to begin exploring what place blogging will take in my life.  I've read Hugh Hewitt's book, "In, but not of" and he suggested that in order to become what I choose to, I ought to have a blog.  So, here's to taking your advice, Mr. Hewitt.

      So, when you buy a new car, there are after costs.  Insurance, Taxes, Gasoline, etc.  Well, on a $21 car, the after costs are just disporportionate.  I had to get her cleaned...$12.  Yeah, more than 50% the value!  I gassed her up...$33.  WHOA!  A whopping 150% the value.  Which got me thinking...she had about 1/3 of a tank when I bought her.  I think...she may have paid for herself right there.   Of course, the CD player she came with, well...that was a bonus!  I had to put a new tire on the front right.  It had been riding on a donut, for about...400 miles.  Well..for at least that many.  And since donuts are made for 40 miles, she was starting to look more like a krispy kreme, than a tire, so...new tire...$60. 300% the value of the car.  I'm still looking forward to taxes and insurance, but...this baby's gonna be worth it!

      I bought my first car! It cost me big, but...I think it'll be worth it. I've always heard that there are two ways to go about car buying. First, get a loan on a decent car, one that won't break down, and drive it while paying it off. You always have a payment to make, but...you drive a decent car.  The other way is to buy a car that you can afford. Something you can purchase outright. The unfortunate side effect of that is, well, you drive something that you can afford, and in my case...that has prevented me from getting a car. Ever. I'm 25. I bought a car once when I was about 17. For a hundred bucks, my dad thought it would be fun to "work on it together," and even though it was a stick...that I couldn't drive. I bought a dodge comudgeon. Well...it was an old dodge. It drove, one time. One day. To church. Dad drove it. Up a skinny, single car wide ramp into the church parking lot, and into a spot. That's where it sat when I left church, and dad said, "No, you drive it." So I got in, having never driven a stick before in my life. Not 10 feet into that one car wide driveway to the parking lot...it's only entrance/exit it died. Completely. Never to go again. It was the most embarassing moment of my life. It stuck, and so was I. Everyone in the ward, everyone I knew...my entire social circle was now inconvenienced because I bought a car that couldn't move. Stupid. I felt like the world's biggest dope. All the girls I could date, all the LDS girls that I knew...all...stuck behind me, in an ugly old dodge that doesn't go. I was mortified. I'd have liked to have died. It was awful. My stomach fell off, I couldn't feel my toes, and then my dad, from the van in front of me hollers "C'mon." I wanted to cry. Ok, I'm a big baby, but I wanted to. I just got out, and started to walk away. Leave it there. Let my dad deal with it. So, dad got out...the family and the van were the last car "free" from the parking lot.  We pushed the car back up to its spot. From which we had to have it towed. Awful.  Ever since, I've been a little shy to actually purchase a car. I've been about a dozen times to test drive, but...I just don't know anything about them. I mean...I get in, and they should drive. I've had a standard "auto" class in high school, and I can take care of one, but...fix one? Not a chance.  So, I'm leary to buying a car that I can afford, for fear that I will repeat Episode I. But, I loathe debt. I just loathe it. I've had a credit card or two, and I have student loans. And they never stop eating at me. I mean, the cards have all been paid off. But the student loans? $30,000 for an education I am still learning to respect. (Kinda feel like 8 years of high school would have done as much for me, but I'm learning otherwise.) Ouch.  So...here I sit. 25 and never having owned a car. I've had bikes, and ridden metros, trams, trolleybusses, metro busses, trains, taken cabs, flown, all-in-all I've taken advantage of just about every means of transport available. It is time.  So, I've been shopping. I've driven Diesel powered VW Jettas, and the new Toyota Prius (which is hands DOWN the best car I've ever driven, on comfort, handling, overall package. Everything.), I've driven Chrysler Sebrings, Chevy Malibus, all kinds of cars.  It just seems so wrong to take out a loan.  So, when a friend said he was selling the car that he hadn't driven in over a year, but instead was using it to "save a parking spot" I offered him 30 bucks for it. Now, I've been around the car for years, and I know it well. It's got 240,000 miles on it. It's 15 years old. It's an Olds Delta '88. Well, he balked. Wasn't sure that he wanted to sell it, and thought perhaps he'd donate it for a tax deduction. Problem is, as a paralegal, you don't exaclty make enough money to take anything other than a standard deduction.  Well...he debated for a couple days. I went on, living my life.  Finally he steps up to the plate. "I'll take it." Adam said. "Alright," I said, but, reaching into my wallet, I've only got $21 now. "There you have it." I retorted, almost belligerently. "$21. That's all I've got now. Should have taken it a week ago."  He took it. Signed it over on the 8th.  The car hadn't been driven in almost a year. It was covered in 1/8 inch of dust, and red clay dirt. So, I dropped $12 on a good inside/out cleaning. That's right...it cost me more than 50% the value of my car, just to have it cleaned.  But, at the end of the day....  I have a car! and almost as importantly, NO new debt!

      Yesterday I rented a car and drove with Maggie to New York. She'd always wanted to see a Yankees game, so over the summer taking her to one had become a goal.  We'd talked about it for weeks, so finally the day was here.  We rented a car, got upgraded for free to a Sebring, though...not a convertible this time.  (Still, gotta love Thrifty!) and drove up to New York City.  When we got there, we weren't sure quite what to do, because the game had been sold out.  So, we thought, 4:30 in the afternoon...Statue of Liberty!  Sweet.  We drove to Park de Libertad or some such thing, and well...turns out we just missed the last ferry.  Wouldn't you know it?  That's just like us.  0 for 2.   So, off we went to the Empire State Building.  What an amazing structure.  Built in just over a year it's 86 stories and $41 million dollar price tag were quite impressive.  As were the views.  $12 was the cheapest ticket we could get to go up and see the city from the observation deck.  4,000,000 people a year charge through there!  Amazing.  We were there right at sunset which was beautiful from the West side, and then, of course...we got to see the city light up through the throngs of people and 9' arched fencing that kept us from jumping.  (as though that would happen).  Then to Gray's Papaya.  Maggie had ALWAYS talked about them and how good they looked in the movies, and how much she wanted to try one.  But when we got them...($2.75 for two hot dogs and a Banana Daquiri) the onions were the wierd onion in runny tomato soup concoction and not the diced onions you can get on the street.  So, she was so disappointed she didn't even order any.  To make up for it, I took her to her first ever White Castle, which was just a block down.  Ha ha.  Those tiny hamburgers crack me up.  I remember when I was a kid you could get them for $.25.   If someone built a White Castle on Pine street in Warrensburg, MO...and kept it open till 3 am, it would make a killing.  I mean, honestly, you could even close it down during the summers if it wasn't making money, it would just make SO much sense.  Every night 500+, mostly drunk, college kids with money and no direction are starving when they leave Pine street at 1:30.  Shoot, you could even pull down a couple grand throwing parties of your own in the White Castle...  Anyway, Gray's was a bust, and Maggie didn't think the tiny hamburgers were as funny as I did (admittedly, I was recording the moment, and she gets wicked stage fright) so, we went to Radio City Music Hall, because I told her that's where David Letterman does his thing.  Isn't it?  We couldn't find one sign that his studio was there, so maybe I was wrong, but...I could have sworn that's where he films from.   Finally we drove around for a half an hour looking for Grand Central Station and we kept thinking that we saw it, until we realized that it was the Library.  Beautiful building, though.  Just off Bryant Park (or something.)  Anyway, on the drive home I passed out so she drove and we got about 1 1/2 hours done before pulling over and sacking out until give or take 6 am, when I took over and drove another 2 hours, before falling asleep and giving the wheel over to her for the final leg.  It was a great trip.  Gotta love road tripping with a girl who can hold her own!

      Every American should see what the  urlLink veterans  who served with John Kerry have to say about him.  The video that you can see at this sight is tremendously powerful, and absolutely damning.

      Well, our first page was posted.   urlLink www.fight4right.org  has a website!  Check it out and let me know what you think.  I mean, none of the links work yet, but...tell me about the color scheme, the logo, etc.  Just lay it on me.  I need this to be really successful, since it's the focal point of our efforts right now.
