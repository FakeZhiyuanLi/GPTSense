       long time..   i have been busy with work, school, rehersal, other random crap, and when i do have free time, my parents are on the computer. so shaddup!  *memories* last night i started getting some memorys of my freind david, one of my favorites being the time my dog ate his bird. i look back and laugh, but it was pretty sad at the time. speaking of pets, i really want the tortoise at the pet store, how cool would that be, a pet tortoise?! and they live for hundreds of years, so it would make a great family heirloom, and sice they can do whatever to turtle shells so they don't rot (dry them out???) so when it died, that generation could still keep the shell. and they would have a reason to keep it, since it is a family herloom, it would be encrusted with jewels. HORRAY! unfortunatly, the tortoise costs 140 bucks, not including food and so on. of course it would not need a coniner, sice it is a family heirloom, and i wil teach it to poop a certain place. horray.  also, i never had a chance to use the self centered idea to find out who joah likes, so im just ganna come clean and tell him i like him.

       what to talk about...   well today was totaly boring... im so tired and what not. so yea, lame day. in orchestra we got our pal mickey, who is our mascot. i guess he is cooler than skinny sam, a peice of lamanated paper, but skinny sam had more personality. so other than that, nothing going on in my life. i guess i did decide to take the arrogant self-cenered approach to finding out who Joah likes, but I honestly do think it might be me, not to sound vain or anything, just the way he and everyone who knows acts about it. so yea, other than that, nothing inresting...

       i gots a job now...   yesterday i started working at mi madre's store, i have a feeling this is going to seriously cut into my lazy time.  the job is ok i guess but it is only a bunch of middle aged women there. i do know them, but still, no kids, and that means no cute guys to hit on.  speaking of hitting on cute guys i did just that to matt at church today. i am prolly doomed just for that little instance. i mean i was hitting on a guy at church, a strait guy none the less, that is coveting, homosexuality, and in church too. yes, well now is time for trading spaces, i shall be gone.

       MOVIE NIGHT!   i really do hate fridays, because i can never do anything so therefore my social life is ultra crappy. ok, so not ultra crappy, but definatly sub-par. anyway, today we watched splendour in the grass. wee. im so glad i whached it since i already know it pretty much line for line. it is also really long, i recomend only people with ALOT of patience watching this movie. i guess bud was kinda cute, i didn't like his eyes much, but and the end he was totaly hot, which is strange cuz im usualy not into grungy dirty guys. whatever. also at michals there was this super hot cowboy working. damn he was hot.  this is all i have to say, i think i shall catch up on blogs and go sleeping.

       meh...   that is a 'i wish my life were more interesting "meh"' just so you know, really nothing special happened today, im so jelous of dylan who can make even the most mundane things seem interesting.... i think i will make something up  today, when i was in math class i was talking this test, and it was really hard. well i finish the test and stuff and im all like 'WOAH I HOPE I DID GOOD' because i talk in all capital letters now. anyway, i hand in the test and i turn around to my desk, and there is a peanut on my chair. im like 'WOAH, THERE IS A PEANUT ON MY CHAIR, I WONDER WHY' and i look over and there is this squirrel sitting on Megan's head. and she just has this big smile on her face. i have no idea how a squirrel got in my math  class, but that doesn't mater cuz i just broke up with my boyfreind.  wow, maybe i should be happy with my dull life, because that story sounded totaly drama queen, especialy the end. but actually i do have a couple true stories. like the other day, my mom comes in the house and hands me some efferdent, im so confused. i don't have dentures, she just gives me this efferdent. yea, she later explained it was for my retainer, but still, i was confused for a while. also, today at rehersal, i was playing with the draw string for the curtain, it has a big metal thingy on the end, so it swings crazily and is fun to play with. anyway, im playing with it, and it swings around the curtain and i hear durran say 'OH CRAP' and i look around to see him removing it from his face with a tramatized look on his face. i scared him with it and hit him in the face, it was hilarious. also that was the only time i heard him talk off stage. he is so quiet, i think he is intimdated by us theatre kids because his grilfreind says he thinks we are weird. i wonder why he tried out for the play if he thinks we are weird. oh well, he is cute so i can fatasize about sucking face with him.  well i think i shall go eat my munchies now, as i am quite hungry.

       SEA MONKIES!   horray! my LJ account still exists, but don't worry, i will keep this one for my life, but if you would like to read about my sea monkies go  urlLink here.   it is very old, but im thinking of getting some new monkies and continuing to update that journal. if the comedy of my monkies is enjoyable to you all i will definatly comence to update, and perhaps move there eventualy...  well about today. i have employed two spies to find out who Joah has a crush on... I can't wait! more drama in other peoples lives... Josiah can no longer go to prom with Molly, since he is going to New York for national dace competiton, and that girl is PISSED. Naomi is naturally quite happy about this arrangement, but *shhh* i didn't tell you that. Also, since Richard isn't going to prom, his special date from New York won't be comming. Well i supose Richard won't be too mad since they will be in NY anyway. But, that means Brittany and Richards plans are ruined. Details: they hate Naomi and don't want her in Josaiah's life or something lame like that, so they set up this huge thing to get Molly to ask Josiah to prom. I dunno how the whole thing goes, but it is very interesting. I really don't know why Richard wants Josiah dating Molly, since Richard wishes Josiah was gay... maybe he is hoping Molly would be a terrible girlfreind.....  ahhh, that feels good to gossip, i wish i had something in MY life to talk about, but i don't... oh well.

       today was good   well, it was nothing special, but there wasn't anything especialy terrible about it. rehersal was really fun for some reason, even though nothing special happened. so yea, i really have nothing interesting to talk about. except my munchies... man. so yea i went to the store to get some munchies and now i am eating them... mmmm munchies.

       another uneventful day   well today was fairly boring, but i wore some of my new clothes, i have never felt so preppy in my life, but after the sweater got blood on it (i got a frikken bloody nose and it got all over my pants and my sweater) i looked better cuz i was just wearing my blue striped shirt. kim loves buttonup shirts so she thought i was sexy, i think Joah liked it to.   oh yea i also had a bloody nose last night at about 2. well i supose that is this morning. anyway it was really bad and a pain in the butt.  now, ralina's kids are staying over night because my neice is being born tommorow morning. they are adorable but obsessed with video games so i can't do my own thing. but they are asleep, so all is good.

      well.... once again i had to do ushering at church. it wasn't so bad, and i got to look at sexy matt again. he is in college and has a bad knee. Well we already are closer than durran and I. then after breakfrast, we went shopping!!! W00T! I got 2 whole new outfits. I think i will buy a brown shirt from the pit, cuz im better than Joah! ok, so he has better fashion but thats because he beats me to EVERYTHING. stupid bitch lol. I also went to Kim's, but we didn't do anything interesting. I feel very content now.   OH hot minister on TV.... damn dad just surfed past. hehe, im just a big slutty loser.

      so anyway, the movie is canadan, that explains everything. yea the wild sex goddess tried to send them all up or somthin'. then the main guy grabbed her boobs and she was like 'how dare you tell me to shut up' and a helicopter showed up. then some guy gets out and one of the girls runs up and is like 'AHHHH NICK CARTER' this guy by the way, is not nick carter. then she proceeds to explain that he is not the suprise musical guest, but he was suposed to at one point. and then they all fly away and some fish guy who can't swim chases the bad guy who got abandoned by the boat.  the end.

       lame movies and more!   ok, so today wasn't bad, went to work call did some stuff. the sewing machine decided it hated me. joah and i got to put up curtains and stuff.  Now i am watching this totaly lame movie on Mtv. it is easily the worst movie ever. it is called 'monster island movie' it is about people on an island with giant insects. the insects are suposed to be like normal insects, but they don't look, or act like it. they are made of plastic and just drop when one little arrow barley peirces their bodies. this girl can't sing... of course she is depressed. and now the main chick is some goddess and her people are dancing like retards while kicking the ants, as well as attacking with weapons. of course a flimsy arrow kills one, but an axe does nothing. wow, now a girl killed one by throwing an orange at its head. ok that is enough describing the crappy movie, i will post later to tell how it ended.  I really like the condom comercials are funny. but i hate the current trojan one with the confused and stupid looking guy. but i love the tampon comercial where she plugs up the boat. tampons are so usefull, i think everone should have a box.

       SPOOKY, IT'S SUPER DARK   yea when we left the Y, it was so dark out i could honestly not see half of the parking lot or any area beyond it, very cool. i guess i had a good day, kinda boring.  not a whole lot to say.  i just tried to pick a fight with some chick who has a bad temper. she thinks she is so much smarter than me with her vocabulary, but really, i know every word she says, i just don't use them often. then she blocked me, what a loser. im so bored, i really wanna do SOMETHING intersting, but i can't.

        *sigh* long weekend   that was a good sigh  well here it is, almost 11:30 on a wednsday, and I'm in the bahamas. the weather back in north dakota is frightning but in this appartment, im in a deluxe vacation home over-looking my private sunkissed beach with fine white sand, swaying palm trees, and emerald green waters. shure to you it may look like snow, a pine tree about to tip over from the wind, and frozen alge on the river, but I have no cares right now, because i have 2 glorious days off.   well now that i have made you all long for summer, and made a happy post, im going to move on to bitching. really all my bitching is of the most trivial kinda. first, feebas is the most annoying pokemon ever, next to tentacool. second, i need a boyfreind to share my tropical resort with. and finaly, i have no car tommorw, how am i going to get zim!  on a lighter note, i had my first real decent conversation with dave in a long time. its not that we dislike each other, i mean i love the kid, but we never see each other around, being 2 grades seperate so he is at central while im at MCC.

        ANOTHER SUCKY DAY    yep, another sucky monday. we lost our student teacher in gym class, and i didn't think Mr. Penis (Johnson) could be worse, but he is. he yells like a jackass the whole hour and at least Mr. Shumway (or however his name was to be spelled) would let Jo and I just stand around. God, i just wanna kick Mr. Penis in the throat. The rest of school was ok.   Then there was rehersal. It was fun, except very long. Then orchestra, I barely had time to go home and eat a sammich. I didn't do my homework, but thats ok, cuz i hate reading and i have till 6th hour for my spanish.

      It's sunday. I hate sundays because tommorow is monday, and that means gym. oh well, next week is only 3 days long so it will be more endurable.  Last night Gabe told me that he was at Megan's, as usual. anyway her mom walks in on them. He claims they weren't having sex, but he said they were  "mac'n a little" whatever that means and the admited to being halfway naked. IT ONLY TAKES BEING HALF NAKED TO DO THAT GABE!!! well he got run out of the house and that story amused me greatly.  My dad made me go usher at church today, who knew that when you don't have to pay attention it goes by so much faster. there was also this one cute guy ushering as well, it was strange since they never have 2 younger ushers.   *yawn* well im going to be tired all day. i hope someone calls me or something or i will be insanley bored.

       i got lost today   i was looking for the wrecking yard to see if they had an old vespa for me to fix up, but i got lost and was late for work, it was a sad day for all.  if you are wondering, a vespa is a motor scooter, it is an italian brand. they are really cool and i want one, preferably older model (60's-70's), but trust me, i wouldn't say no to a new one. i definatly wouldn't like an 80's-90's one though. but basicly thats it, i want a motor scooter, a vespa to be exact. i might start a costom tee shirt business to raise money for it too! huzzah!  well i accadently installed the ad thing for msn pluss, so im off to fix it. g'night!

       adventures of Jamestown   well, yesterday i went to Jamestown for state music, it was interesting to say the least. first off i watched Mike play his solo, wee! then we went to his house, it was fun i supose we watched this really sad group play ff songs in costume. so then we went out for chinese, it was pretty good i supose, but my shrimp wasn't deveined and it kinda tasted funny so i just ate vegies and rice, but Mike's chicken was delicious. there was a kid there who look like a guy, but he had boobs, i don't mean normal guy boobs, i mean like real boobs, they were spherical and everything.... i was confused. also, its name was shane... then we went cruzin, not a whole lot happend there, but we got to the school and started talking about condoms so i decided i wanted to go purchace some cuz i was bored, so we go down to mini mart and i buy one of each kind, altough instead of giving me a 'fantasy' it gave me another 'aroma's' so i have a banana and mint scented one, a studed one ('rugged 'n' ready') and something i thought was a condom but turned out to be gel inteded for putting on a clitoris to create a tingling sensation. that was really the highlight of the day. then after i played we left, the bus ride home was fun though cuz derrek and i were both tired and giggly. wee!

       LONG TIME NO SEE   ok, here is the story, we finaly moved into the new house. ok, no problem. my dad says we will not get internet till later in the week, i can wait i guess. (i finaly have my precious DSL again) then we start to paint so we don't set up the computer until now, 3 weeks later. so that is what is up with that.  also, my first performance was tonight, it went well i supose. i had fun. however, spirit gum is SATAN i have to wear a retarted mustache. i hate it, it is uncomfortable and it hurts to take off.   now for some updates on my life. last tuesday i was at scouts and this one kid, a freshman i belive, is being very freshman male-esque. basicly major testosterone poisoning. anyway he started to irritate me so when he says something about beating the crap out of something or whatever i was like 'thats very freshman of you' he pauses for a bit and - i am not making this up- his comeback was 'nice nails, did you get a manicure' yes ladies and gentlemen, that is our future, i weep. anyway while trying not to laugh i say 'no, that is my self care, but they are getting a bit long, i should perhaps cut them.... but a manicure would be a good idea for prom, thanks' and then he says 'while you are out you can pickup a prom dress, i hear they are on sale' so i say 'no nyssa already has a dress i think.' then i burst out laughing at him and he got so angry. it was great fun.  I got my room and some of my furniture painted for my room, it will be blue and silver.   W00T! the pool manager called yesterday and i got the job if i can get a hold of him, everytime i call it is busy *grumble grumble*  well that is some of my favorite events of the past several weeks, horray for me! so buh-bye for now

       heinz post   catchup posts are fun!  well it is sortof a catchup post, not a whole lot has happend siince my last post. on saturday i went to troy. lots of naked brad pitt. it was an ok movie, but im not into those sorta action/history movies. i didn't think gladiator was very good either so meh whatever. anyway, troy had lots of cool fight scenes.... lots of lame other scenes too.   work was sucky tongight. not that it was busy or annoying or anything, but i was tired and hungry and hot the whole time. not to mention that i just gernaly didn't want to be there. i wanted to be here playing puzzle pirates.  speaking of puzzle pirates, that is why i have not posted in a while. and for those wondering, the reason my last post was like 4, it was coz blogger was being stupid and pretending not to work when it really was.

       im angry/depressed   i have lots of reasons, and the newest, is that i had just typed up a huge post and it wasn't publishing so, now it is lost. fucking blogger. here, and now im going to try my patiece and re type it  tonight has sucked majorly. first off i was late for the playmaker picnic, since my car is not funtioning (fucking car) and i had to take my moms. she didn't get home till 7:30. i thought it started at 7, and i hate being late more than anything.  it just flat out makes me mad. and it turns out i was not a half hour late, but a full hour late. great, that means i missed dinner. thanks mom, now im not going to sleep coz of hunger pains and going to be grumpy tomorow. although, i dunno if i can blame her since she didn't really know i needed her car, but i don't care, i need someone to blame. anyway, then gabe didn't get his best mime because mira and susan tied, and then when i pointed that out susan got all mad at me (prolly coz she thoguht i was trying to take her award away) so great, it is starting out lovley. then on a more minor note, i was going to swing with joah which would be happy, then richard decides to get a ride with him and i don't see it all night. now not only am i angry, but i have lost my first souce of joy. fucking richard should get his own damn car. so anyway, after the 10 minutes that i was at the picnic we went to kims. this was fun for a while, then we decided we didn't want to play videogames, but wanted to learn about horoscope personality things. mine was amazingly acurate, and they weren't all vauge either, like it described how i looked, how my room looks and how i act. it said i go through low mood swings, but get out of them fast, which i do, and i will be out of this one in about 10 minutes. and it also mentioned that i get bored easy. guess what, i got bored of that horoscope thing, and there were 4 more to sit through. i stoped paying attention and started tinkering with stuff in steph's (kim's sister) room. there weren't very many interesting things becuse i got bored of this soon. so now im bored, angry and hungry. gabe, jo, and i played games for a bit, but i got kicked off of those and kim and megan were ignoring me whenever i would try to join the convo. being ignored is the reason i left derek,ian, jared etc group. because i was constantly ignored. HINT HINT FUCKERS. only one of you reads this, so thats a good thing, and since you are the one who didn't piss me off at all, i like you! you know who you are. anyway, when i realised there was no point in being there i went outside of steph's room and played with valdimer (the cat) he gave me loads of attenton, but they still hadn't noticed i left. infact they didn't notice untill they decided to leave, and they all walked past me and i said 'i forgot my glasses in there' and i think kim herd me and was a bit suprised to find me still there. i tell myself im going to ignore here tommorow, but by then i will be happy as a lark again. sometimes i hate being a gemini. and to add, now mike h. isn't talking to me.  on a lighter note, i got my zim DVD and a new necklace today.

       i hate being ignored   im in a bad mood, i had a crappy evening, but it will pass in the next 15 minutes or so. first off, i had to wait for my mom to go to the playmakers picnic, and i hate being late for/waiting for stuff. why? because my car can't stay in one frikken peice. and then i was a hour late for the picnic so i saw the ends of the awards and didn't get dinner. i ate some corn and a bit of cake. k so it was alot of cake, but still, thats not fucking dinner. then i was going to swing with joah and richard decided he needed a ride from joah and then they ended up both going home i guess. i was sad. then we went to kims, that was great till i ran out of things to do in steph's room. and then i was ignored the rest of the time. i ended up going out of steph's room and petting the kitty. nobody noticed i was gone, and then they went upstairs, walking right by me not noticing me still, and kim only realised i was there because i said 'i left my glasses in there' (my cool new sunglasses..... see im already less depressed if im talking about fashion) so basicly it was a crappy night.  however, good things that happend: i went shoping and got a necklace. but onther than that shoping was boring. oh and on a side note, now i have a bowl of gross potato salad....

Do you like... *looks around* peas? *GASP* you said peas! how dare you. of course i don't like peas *suspicious look* 3. Kiosk? KIOSK!  now on to rent. first when i got there i saw pat and some girl, i can't frikken remeber the girl's name, but i think it began with an 'M' anyway, since when is pat hot??? i forgot to mention that the trip to bismark was fun yada yada yada. but yea, pat =  teh uber hot. the musical was awsome, the music was great, i wanna see it agian, it was awsome. (mike just told me the girls name is maren) so yea, i loved it, but i was sad when mheemhm shmeledaed of WRIMSAS those that saw it get my drift. i hope...  yesterday was an adventure, first was work, and it was fun for once. we had a blast selling ugly ballons for cheap then i went to the movie with kim and nyssa, but unfortunatly, the movie started a half hour before i got there, coz nyssa told me wrong! grr. then we went to belisimos and wendys. i saw chris and jen, it was cool i guess. and then we went to kim's and watched big fish, not much going on yesterday. and today i sold more ugly ballons at work then went to gammys, not much today either. the end bye!

       horray!   first off, gym was actually fun today! we had a free day so jocie and I made up games involving the medicine ball, which had the amusing propertey of being heavy in air, but incredebly light in water, barely sinking. first we tried to play blitzball with it, but since when you threw it it would go forward about 2 feet then start its slow decent, we gave up. then we went looking for this torpedo that travels through the water very well, didn't find it, so we tried to play keep down with the tenis ball, that didn't work, so we finaly moved on to playing catch with the medicine ball. it made cool splashes. but catch is too boring for us non jocks so we started to play water calvin ball till the end of the period. it was good.  after school, i had work. Andy wasn't there. if i  haven't explained Andy yet, i will just say he is hot, and go into further detail tommorow. oh, and i was working at the pool, my summer job, not party america. anywho, we were cleaning the pool with hydrochloric acid, and i can still smell it. that stuff burns like crazy. but now the pool is clean *happiness* after work i decided to drive around the park in my scooter, and then some other guy had a scooter, not like mine, one that is shorter, and is like those lame razor ones only with a pretty nice motor, and a low seat. anyway i was driving along and he comes up behind me and asks how fast it goes. we get into a breif conversation and end up racing through the park, it was wonderful coz once we got past the cars/pedestrians i beat his ass. then i went to kims, nothing eventful there

       fun stuff   ok at work today, this one 'pimp daddy' with his 'tripped out' car 'rolled up' near the paper wharehouse. "ok," i think, "even people like that go to parties that include theames." then he gets out and goes to NSR -  national salon resource. keep in mind he did this just before it closed. anyway, nsr is like a hair product place, and only people who work in salons or are in the direct family of people with salon license can buy things from the majority of the store. so this guy goes and buys stuff and leaves. i am laughing my ass off, thinking 'what a queer' cus i think joah and i are the only two who ever go in there, and he was one of those people who worry so much about their cars. it was ammusing cuz he went late so nobody would see him.   tonight is a hot guy night on tv, like every channel i go to has a hot guy on it. so i shall go drool. g'night

       the outdoors...   where to start.... oh yes, yesterday. i worked yesterday, veeeeeerrrrryyyyy long day at work. it made me sad, then i came home and found out kim called me, so i called her back and she asked if i could go to the movie, mean girls, so i agree to go after dinner. anyways, the movie was funny, and ALOT beter than i expected.  then we went to applebees to check out hot guys, that didn't work out coz we only had girls serving on our side of the resturant, and all of the costomers were gross. although there was some guy checking out kim when we were talking about hot asians. it was funny. then we went to belisimo and nyssa now hates chess, while kim beat her ass twice, even though kim had equal experience to nyssa (zero). it was a good night  anyway, aobut today now. first off, WHY DIDN'T ANYONE WARN ME PARKS WERE BAD FOR YOU! that makes me angry *grr* anyway the last two nights the kids spent the night, don't know or care why, whatever, so today i was stuck with them ALL DAY it was excruciating and boring. the scooter was beconing me (by the way, i can't ride it coz it has no insurance, can't remeber if i mentioned that) and that made me angry. then eventually we went to the park. oh. my. gawd. the park. first off, those swings are deadly, i tried to use one and fell off. then i got dizzy once i got the hang of it. damn swings. then we went on a walk cuz gage wanted to. it was a long walk and i could hardly breath by the end. not to mention that i was already sick and this evil chemecal knowen as 'fresh air' made me cough alot. it was painful. oh and i forgot mention, TREES ARE ATTACKING ME ALL DAY. i hate trees now, they should all burn. fucking trees.  after that we had a meeting at the paper, it was good, mary was there and she is pretty cool, but she should have brought the kids, her kids are the r4wks0r. then i came home and ate, so it was a crappy day more or less. yea, thats it.

       WORK   yesterday at work was quite the odd day... first there was creepy guy, he has been to the pool the past few days and is really creepy. he hits on the girls, both the swimmers and the guards. he sings to them sometimes too, he is just generaly creepy. he is a crappy singer, but yesterday he was claiming to be the backup singer for Reba (she had a concert last night). anyway, he is offering to let these girls in for free... probly to rape them or something.... we told daryl about him (he didn't know untill yesterday) and now he is trying to get the guy 'removed' since apparently  he has charges like sexual harrassment, stalking, stuff like that. so very creepy guy and then, to make the day more interesting, psyco chick was there. now the name says it all with psyco chick... she is so weird in like alot of things.. like this one day she randomly like, bit her leg... and her general manerisms are just strange. her name is emily, but she seems to prefer 'vega' since this one time she kept writing 'vega (heart) don' in the sidewalk with her wet finger.... she is very strange indeed. then there was this guy, whom is not cute at all, but i sent rachel (more on her later) to go talk to him for me to get her off my back. anyway today he asked me if i really did think he was cute and i was just like 'shure'   so anyway, i have always had the urge to flirt with a random strait guy, especialy one that is from the base, since they tend to be quite homophobic. well that was pretty much the extent of him, but still it was kinda funny... the only thing missing yesterday was rachel, then it would have been an AWSOME day... *rolls eyes* she is just really annoying... she likes to pick a lifegaurd for the year and just not leave them alone... last year it was april, since she would usualy let her do ANYTHING... this year it is david and i... woopie. i think she kinda liked me, but she found out i was gay... but she still likes to pester me... whatever  so that was my work day... i also called jeff, but he was in jujitsu... and last night i was talking to jocie and she was irritating me... she has never talked to jeff or any thing and she thinks im feeling only lust for him... gawd... just because SHE is in love with katie, she assumes she is the big expert (sorry darling, but i need to vent somewhere)  well today i work at oak.... the fact that the fair is here should mean we have a total of 3 kids today..... i mean roosevelt has been busy, but not NEARLY as busy as it normaly would.... horray!

       big update   ok, so i realise i have not updated since before i went to florida, except that one that was just for the sake of updating.  flordia was awsome, i had a total blast, i think i could have spent the whole week in just downtown disney with a crapload of money, but then i couldn't have gone to the other places. i got lots of neet things in the japan store at epcot. one night at downtown disney cathrine, ashley and i had fun using gaydar to figure out who was or who wasn't gay, we got about 53 i think, just in one night. that could be because june is pride month and the orlando gay days were fast approaching. while i was there i discovered a cool gay mag called genre. i also bought this totaly ghey shirt in the 'cirque' store. i could go on for hours and hours about florida, but that might bore you.  anyway, i got home and  my dad found my genre and threw them away, i recovered them by sneaking out of the house at 2 in the morning before garbage day. it was cool.  other than that i have been spending the last month or two working. i have a fairly nice tan i supose.  i told jocie and joah about jeff tonight (lots of 'j's lol) jocie didn't seem to take it too well (sorry hun... don't feel bad i understand) but joah was happy for me. i still need to tell kim, i don't know how that will go over.... anyway, that is about it, no really juicy details...

       odd day...   yea so today alot of stuff happend...  i get up, all that jazz and as im leaving i put on my sachel, and it is mysteriously lighter... i look inside to find, GASP, my dad threw away my Genre(s) (its a gay mag)  away... again. a little back story, i bought them down in florida, 2 of them, and then i got another here in minot (i was shocked to even find it) and now i have a subscription.  anyways, one day i leave them sitting out after reading them and my dad throws them away. the next monday at about 2 am i'm sneaking out of the house to seach the garbage out front. i do not succeed, but find the next morning it is still there, this time i find them. anyway, this morning they are gone, but he is off to work and my mom is sick and distracted, so i just pull them out, real quickly this time. my dad is an ass and i was all pissed off this morning, i was really distracted when riding to work and almost went to the wrong pool. w/e im thinking im just going to give him the old 'im gay and proud' slap to the face.  anyway, im working and then daryl just puts me in a worse mood and tells me to go over to roosevelt, i HATE roosevelt, it is lame and stuff. oak is way more fun. well, he randomly changed his mind just as i was about to go, so i guess i was relieved, but still not happy, which is unusal becase usualy im only unhappy for about 10 minutes at a time.  i was really pissed, as a said.  later, i was GREATLY cheered up when i found out regan would be managing.... normaly it would be Daryl, but since jeanette quit, the managers have had to have weird scedules... but thats ok because i heart regan, she is awsome! we went off and played on the playground for a bit, i forgot how fun swings are! so yea, i had a good rest of the day  Then, durring evening session i had my mothers cell phone with me and Jeff tried to call, but parker was being slow and i was late for my break and i missed him... then i tried to use a phone card to call him back and i messed up someway or another every time, i think one of the times i called a porn line.... then ashley did it for me with HER card, and there was only a minute left on the card, most of wich we spent trying to hear each other because it was so quiet... arg...  then tonight i went to belisimo's with danni and aubri, we were having loads of fun... jeff called me while i was there, but we didn't get much talking done, because i was having fun talking to danni and what not, and i think he was kinda intimdated by their precense or something. he talked to aubri for a bit, then i left and we had a good conversation... now im at home... basicly it is the most exciting day i had in a while...  comment if you like, and please answer my previous post
