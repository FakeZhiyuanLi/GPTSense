      Where did we all go? Mentally, that is  Somewhere we got lost Somehow we've forgotten  Life takes over Everyday life  Rememeber your childhood Remember your children  What will they think of us? our values disappeared  Somewhere we got lost...     Copyright ©2004

      Voices of nature surround me friends I have lost  or left behind?  Family that is living but not always there?  Souls I confide in that hear my thoughts leading me down a new path  Is it my conscious? Am I insane?  I just need someone to hear me...     Copyright ©2004

      can you keep my secret? do you promise not to laugh? until I do  will you judge me if I tell you? will you listen? if I do  they told they laughed as I did  in us we trust in others... we hope to trust    Copyright ©2004

      So many times in life things seem out of reach We didn't try hard enough? We just don't see...  We are Beyond Ourselves  Exhausted Energy wasted on want not necessary for life Power we cannot control...  We are Beyond Ourselves  So many times in life the path seems clear And still we question Are the answers...  Beyond Ourselves?    Copyright ©2004

      I tell myself I know better yet it seems my heart does not hear cause it leads me into temptation that I know I cannot bear  My decisions aren't always based on fact damn feelings seem to lead me I ask myself when will I learn feelings are deceiving!!  Many times I try to shake that little voice inside that tells me I must follow my heart and my head is along for the ride  Damn you little voice, I say your words I no longer hear Starting now my head's in the lead with my heart bringing up the REAR!!!!  :D

      WHEN I LOOK  at the trees  and the sky hear the wind so alive who am i to erase all the pain that it sees and it feels does it hear  all the sounds all around does it know who believes im so scared theres no peace common ground will it cease who will know no one left  to control all the money no more pride its the fog in the eye of our soul

      I am what I see in the mirror I am what makes me smile I am what drives me to succeed I am what's inside of me  I will not be what someone desires I will not be what they see I will not be driven by worry I will not refuse to be me  I will however compromise some selfish part of me that focuses on all my wants instead of just my needs  I know that when it happens I may not think it's me but I know now that I'll realize life is WE not ME   :D
