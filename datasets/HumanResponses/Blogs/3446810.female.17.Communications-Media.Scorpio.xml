       urlLink     Doesn't he look like a clown?   The party was fun, but you were not around. You broke my heart. You made me cry. You yanked so hard, You left a scar.  This is your gift to me. Your gift of love. You came and you stayed. You came and you wanted to go.  Tell me soon, I've gotta go.

      You wish. Your  naive  thinking. Just when you thought you were really doing your best to be understanding, to give him the space and time, he hurts you. Hurts you like splinters in your feet. You feel the sudden tightening of your heart. You wish he wasn't speaking the truth. But he is. It's an unspoken promise. You two will never lie to the other. You'd be open and trusting. He sure is open... At the times he feels like it. He'd open the stitches from your heart.  Thread by thread  he  yanks  and  tugs . He doesn't seem to hear your cry. Or perhaps, he really doesn't care. Not anymore. Not after the way you've hurt him. You've hurt him deep. He'd never treat you the same. No more. You went too far. All his tears, all his promises, were nothing but lies. Lies to keep this naive bitch like you. You waltzed right into him palm. His palm, not his heart.  You asked if he wanted this, no says no. Your back turned, he take it. And you two aren't even married.   He's tired of you. He doesn't want your company. He doesn't even want your body anymore.    He wants time away from you.   I've to do some house errant he says. I've something on, I just can't remember what it is.  Oh,  go look for your friends ! I've found my company.  He'd stay out late no matter how tired he is, with people. Anyone but you.  What can you do? Nothing.  What can you say? Nothing.  What would he say? He'd ask you if you want him to give up everything for you. Then all his time will be yours.  Bullshit.

      It's going to be a  hectic week  ahead. Off to facilitate the Sec Two camp tomorrow. It's a  three day two nights  thing, but I'd be returning home tomorrow. Have a dinner tomorrow evening, so I won't return to camp after that.  When I return from camp on Monday, I've a breather day. I'd probably be  rushing for interviews  etc.   Wednesday , I'd be off to  Tanjong Balai . This is what I've been waiting for all my life. A mission trip. Finally. Although it's not in some exotic place like Mongolia.  I really want to visit Mongolia one day, and do some volunteer work. We'll see... I've plenty of "Save the World" dreams... It's all a matter of time.   The route maybe long, but if you put your heart and mind into it, and give it your best, You'd be where you always wanted to be.   Anyhow, having to take  Malaria  pills, and supposedly to take  Hep A  jab... It's pretty scary. I've not taken the jab, and I've no intention to. Will probably carry tonnes of mineral water.  I'd be back on  Saturday . PHEW!  And it's either I've landed myself a job, or I'd be hitting town for more.  Met up with SalmonYoung again today. She managed to get a Sales Assistant job with Ice Lemon Tea. I'm not sure if it's still on. congratulations anyway!  Today, we went to "visit" DurianQueen at Levis. He's working there... Full time today. We even lunched together.  Applied with Sasa for a job. The lady was quite nice. The applicants were pretty old. Anyhow, I'd know within these few days. Hopefully they give staff discount!!! SalmonYoung would be thrilled!  I later popped into  Dorothy Perkins . They did not advertise or anything, I simply walked in. It's strange how I have the courage to do such things these days. Gungho and enthusiastic to do something.  I amaze myself sometimes.  I later popped by esprit to apply. They said "I'd call you". It means, "You're out."  Anyhow, I really don't want to miss a thing. Since I'd be off the whole week, I'd probably pass my phone to my sister to answer my calls. Especially for the jobs.  Really hope Dorothy Perkins calls this weekend. Then I can arrange to go down for the interview on Tuesday, before I leave.  But, HEY! If they want to see me over the weekend, I'd still go for the interview. I'd just excuse myself from the camp for a couple of hours. Yep.  Really want to get a job.  Although I am pretty positive about the outcome with Chomel, I might not take up the offer. I'd rather work in a proper shop, than at a counter.  I want to work in a boutique. Like Dorothy Perkins. The family of TopShop.  Maybe I should try Mango. They are a family of Royal Sporting House. Maybe I should try some sports shop. We'll see.  Highlight of the day would be... I ran into ApplePie (the fish fillet) at PS today. It was after lunch. We were at the outdoor macs, SalmonYoung wanted a puff. Chatted and shrieked with ApplePie. She was such a BITCH! As usual. We bitch about each other all the time, that's why we are the best of friends after so long. She's darn brilliant. Anyhow, she told me to pursue my dreams now. Take off now. But I won't. I'd complete my media studies, and then apply for Med school.  ...Oh babe, I hate to go.

       SHOPPING shopping shopping !  I so have to get to job to support my spending habits. Not like I'm in love with shopping, I just  can't control  my spendings. I've always had what I wanted when I was young. I can't seem to get enough.  I badly need an income. Not just to support my spending, but my further studies. I need to do better...  Chomel, here I come! Oh well, I'm pretty positive about getting this sales assistant job. Will be notified, latest Wednesday, 02 June 04.  Speaking of 02 June 04, I'd be off to Tanjong Balai (Indonesia) for a four days, three nights mission trip. The Girls will be helping Dr Angela Lim (Lim Country Clinic) to do the health checkup for the kids there... and to teach them the English Language...  How do you  TEACH  a language like English? In four days? I don't even speak Bahasa.  The Guys are planting trees and cementing floors... Sounds like so much fun! They'd definitely have a greater experience.  Oh well, God's will. I really hope to learn a thing or two from Dr Angela... Perhaps this can second my calling.  Anyhow, I'm hoping for more jobs later. Have a few calls to make, and an interview with E to go for. Wish me luck.

      Have yet to get a good night's sleep. You're tired, your eyes just shut... Your feet hurt, your back hurts... You just can't sleep...  Perhaps you've had an exciting day, Perhaps tomorrow would be exciting. Perhaps you just have a  broken heart . Perhaps Perhaps Perhaps...  Aren't you sure of anything anymore?  All these years you've made your choice. Now it's all  too late .  Why choose media studies? All your life you wanted to be in the medical line. Before you applied, you had a calling. Yet  you doubted .  You refused to budge. You wanted to  fight for love . But you were  so young . You got it  all w rong.   Messed up  your life, Messed up the finances.  You've wasted time,  tears , and money. You missed the love you wanted all your life... He was there... on the other side of the world.  You were so so close .  Be consoled however, Dad says it's ok to decide you want a different career after you graduate. Just do your sums.  I wish you luck.  I wish you'd wake up from your fairytale dreams. Leave  Tinklebell  behind. You're too old for her now. Leave your  imaginary  world. It's not going to be projected to life.   You can't always wait for the right moment, sometimes, you just got to jump.   Right now, get yourself an  income . Your veterinarian studies is not going to come cheap. It's going to take you at least six years.  Be decisive.   Pray and seek Him .

      What a  difference  a day makes... East counter hosted mostly Asians yesterday, hardly any  Charmings ... Like what Rudiya said yesterday, the turn of events happen very fast. Today, congratulations to myself! Many more decent ones... David Beckham look a likes...  Mr  Leon Day , if only you know how you made my day. You were the owner of the lost credit card. You were the  cutie  from Ireland. Thankfully you arrived with two male friends... If not I might think you gay.  Such sweet voice you have. Such lean body you hold. Gentle, polite and jovial, you deserve better.  I hope you are having a ball of a time out there painting the city of Singapore red. Making the girls nose bleed. Just don't hook up any of them alright?   Cheerios  to you too my Irish friend.  My  PUMP hunk , I simply adore your British accent. Hopefully you aint a  Priest  like what my daddy said... But then again, if you are a Priest, although you'd break many hearts - girl and guy alike, I'd be more relieve. Who knows... As Father Bal(d) once said, "God keeps the best men for himself" Father was complimenting himself, but all the same.   God bless  you too my sweet Brit.  They are  crooks  I bet. Smuggling health products and paintings out of China.  PRAISE and THANK G OD I've the  Tanjong Balai mission trip  next week, so I did not apply for the job. It's really strange how He works.  By the way, Tanjong Balai's in Indonesia if you were wondering...  Just spoke to  my other half, I love him so very much . He's training those youths for SYF.  It was uneventful, yet out of the ordinary, for now. Legs all sore, mind's all cramped, stomach's empty.   ========================== LoVe oNe bUt nOt tWo FiND onE aNd bE tRue If yoU fiNd oNe cUte aNd cOoL StiCk tO tHe ONE liKe gLue!!!

      ... but it's the best I can do.  I wonder what is it that you are looking for. In life, in love, in peace, in pain.  When at peace, you inflict pain. When in pain, you break love. When in love, you get peace. and yet  ...the cycle continues...  Just what  do  you want?  What do you get out of hurting yourself and the people you  claim  to love? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.  Wait! You do get something. You get hurt. That's what you like isn't it? Hurt! Self-pity!  That's pathetic. Yet you choose to dwell in it. How many times have you been drenched?  I guess it's really time I made up my mind. Be more decisive. And stand by my decisions.  In life, in love, in peace, in pain...

      Somehow things got clearer the moment the dream broke. I don't remember what it was about. But one thing for sure, you shouldn't make me spin.   Was "hunting" for a job online last night... Thanks to SalmonYoung. Just engaging the search engine, and entering the company sites to take down the details.   I've to got to get down to doing the calling and going for interviews. We'll see.   Right now, I think I might be working on some art projects of my own...   ========================== LoVe oNe bUt nOt tWo FiND onE aNd bE tRue If yoU fiNd oNe cUte aNd cOoL StiCk tO tHe ONE liKe gLue!!!

      Seeing you again today, made my day. Bumping into you time and again within the hour, made me ponder. "Deja vu" you said. I met you on my way for my break and again on my way back. I've seen you so many times within the short span of an hour. We chatted more today.  I've not thought much of you since meeting you last Wednesday. Strangely, today it's different... I thought about you on my journey home. I thought of the "offer" you made. Perhaps you were joking. I thought of the cake you baked. It sure tasted good. I hope you get stressed more often, cause it'd only mean I get to eat more of your bakes. You're a nice guy. Not too bad a looker. I want you to meet my sister.  Right now, you just make my mind spin. Turn my imaginary world upside down with your appearance. I do hope to see you again... Soon.  I'd be at the same place tomorrow... I wonder if you'd be...

       High and Lifted up, Jesus Son of GOD The darling of Heaven...   Back from the airport, packed for my trip tomorrow. Spoken to my sweetheart and all ready for bed. Dad picked me up from the airport today, so I could get home fast. Mom made hell lot of noise. -ignore completely- Silence is the best way to handle.  I was on duty at Terminal 2 Satellite today. Business was very very very very extremely slow moving. Walked around on my own quite a bit. It's the first day I'm handling T2. The thought of screwing up big time was nagging me. And I did screw up I guess. Today was horrid. The relieve CSO was horrid. This Malay lady. Young, and slim, with an attitude that stinks. (Did that rhyme?) All the pax wanted to know was where the OASIS lounge was and the CSO was attending to another pax at that time, so I assisted her with this pax, and she told my pax to hold on. She handled her case, and then directed my pax. She then told me, "Directing pax is our job. You all are here to escort them. If not, we won't need you all here right?" May I add, she said it with a smile... It might have lighted her pretty face a little, but it did not change the message she was putting across. Obviously I was bummed. I wrote it down on my report. And from then on, I escorted every single pax. Yes, even to the gents. LOL. Met pretty nice men along the way. The evening was dull, I took long walks back to the counter.   Highlight of the evening...  To the guy wearing the REDBULL tee... You're HOT! Nice head and earrings. Thanks for the snap shot. It's very complimentary. I wish I could have joined you for your meal, but unfortunately, you were 5 mins early. Let fate bring us together again.  It happened after I escorted a pax to the smoking room. I made my way back, nah, I did not take the long way back. And then, nearing my counter, at the Sports Bar, this cutie with a shaved head started waving frantically at me. I thought he was waving at someone behind me, so I looked ahead... He waved even more frantically... And as I neared, he made me smile, and took a shot of me. Very fast. The flash was blinding. He thanked me and I walked on... I think his two other friends were pretty embarrassed. They just looked at me and smiled. LOL. When I got back to my counter, I was looking around, and did not realize he was standing in front of me.. OPPS! And my CSO asked how she could help him... He made an excuse like, "Where's Burger King?" LOL.  The CSO gave him the directions, and he came over to me, and said "Thank you for smiling for my camera -pointing to pocket-" again, with a huge grin. Adoring! And returned to his friends... They then walked by to head towards BK which was a level up. His friend pointed to me and said something, he then turned around, and asked if I wanted to join him... I smiled and shook my head... Unfortunately, I was still 5 mins away from knocking off, and the CSO was there looking and listening. LOL He then proceeded up, and my CSO said in mandarin, "You're dead, they're interested in you..." LOL  Such a joker and cutie he is... May fate bring us together again.   Till we meet again, Adious.   Right now, I'm telling Mr AppleJuice what to bring to Tanjong Balai tomorrow. AND searching for my past entries... Wonder where they disappeared to.  Will be turning in soon.

      Good good good.  Something good in everything I see...   The dinner last night was amazingly filling, although I did not really eat much. Brekz. Place for meat and carbo loaders.  My brother was late and didn't get to eat. HAHA funny him. He went from his school to the other end of Singapore... Wonder how he found his way in the end. But he was still at the wrong complex. We searched for him, and came home.  Anyhow, I ate till I was feeling sick. LOL Will be leaving for Tanjong Balai tomorrow, so I'm not exactly worried about weight right now.  Hmmm, WASSSUP!!!! This came from BONG. The cute little Sec 2 kid, Nicholas. Nicky looks and acts like a Pri 5 kid.   I believe in angels...   My baby wrote me a note during the camp! And I'm so touched by it.. it was so sweet of him to write a lovely note to me and place it in my mail. Aw...  I'm missing him so much!!!  We'll be going on the trip together though. Hope we all have fun.

      I'm finally  officially employed . For this holiday at least. Managed to get a vacation job. Starting this coming  Monday .  Just got back from church camp, will be off to Tanjong Balai on Wednesday.  Looks like I can rest tomorrow.  No more job hunting  for now at least. But I've airport duty.  Got to shift my duty days here and there, cause I've to accommodate the work schedule.  I've a confirmed job now, just have yet to find out which location will I be at. They'd call me mid week... Which means, I'd have to leave my phone with my sister.   Goodbye Chomel. Hello Sasa .  Can't wait to start working soon.  Independence.    Praise and thank God. All glory to Him.  For He gave me such a great family like mine, with a sister who cares. It's credits to her, she's the one who checked the papers for me. Thank you. Credits also to SalmonYoung, she accompanied me on my job hunt. Although I'm not too sure about her employment status now. Hope she's doing fine.  Anyhow, I'm just so eager. So very eager.

      Say you'd love me again Undo this hurt you caused As you walked out of this door and walked out of my life  Here I stand  alone , with this  emptiness  in my heart. I wonder how you're doing, I wonder if you cared. Not a single sign, not a single whiff of hope.  I need to know you care .  The night was dull without you round. I wish you were, right here with me. Looking around,  I was so alone . You are mine, yet it seems not.  Maybe you're holding on to this cause it's been long. You don't dare venture out of your comfort zone. Maybe you're holding on for namesake. Maybe you just feel responsible.  There's nothing you have to take responsibility for. These are all part and parcel of life. There's no point holding on for namesake. People have eyes to see and sense to feel. You brush them off by saying, why bother what people say. There's no need to hold on to this just cause we've been together this long.  Let it go now . It's not too late.  We aren't married yet .  It's better we left this before both of us get hurt further. It's better to bear the short term pain then to carry on being miserable and ruin your entire life.  I know you love me very much. JumboLobster spoke to me after Holy Thursday. He told me how much I meant to you, although you have a different way of showing you care.  I know you love me. He reassured me. But  I need  affirmation  .  Affirmation from you . Security  no one else but you  can give.  I don't want to keep going in circles. I'm running out of stamina. I'd rather quit than be tripped. Perhaps, it's really time to  say goodbye .  Although we made a promise to remain the best of friends, I'm afraid, I can't live up to that. I'm sorry. Perhaps time will heal the pain, but the place you took in my heart...  It's been rooted so long, it hurts even more when it's lifted. Even when it's been removed, the mark remains. No matter how you fill it, it'd still be depressed.  I wonder how, I wonder why... The turn of the tide could cause one's life. The turn of events could break one's heart. The turn of time, could make them disappear.  Isolation is not good for me...

      Tell me have you seen her?  Never one to say much, Never one to contribute.  Silent and contemplative, Watchful yet careless.  Confused I dare say I am. Lost, I say I might.  You came and gone, I tried, I failed.  Perhaps I never really tried. Perhaps time just ran out.  I missed you today. I missed you since the change.  Could this be the end? Destiny. Life.  They're strange, aren't they?

      PHEW! What a long day it has been! Blistered feet and aching bones... Heels can kill. I marvel at ladies who stride up and down town in their heels. My attempts at walking from Downtown to Chinatown always left my feet either blistered or hurting at the BALLS. *roll eyes* Add on backache to the list now.  GREAT! My brilliant sister just got herself stuck out somewhere and needs Dad or Mom to pick her up... Yes, MOM. She's that desperate. Now I've to be the mean one to wake Dad from his sweet slumber...  Oh well, met up with Louis in town at 1300h and we visited my dear SalmonYoung who's working as a promoter now... We got to sample the Dragon Beard Candy which would otherwise cost a bomb... $3 for a candy measuring one inch by one centremetre. WOW.  We then walked around the shopping centre in search of a stuff toy... OH!!! We bought the Sotong Balls and bubble tea... Where will I be without bubble tea?! Headed down along the shopping centers... Weaving in and out of the shops... And Louis reminding me of the good weather and that we should be out sun tanning!!!  We finally arrived at PS. Went to look for DiamondQuest at Levis. He was attending to a Mandarin speaking customer. The customer asked which color suited her daughter better, Red or Blue. I said Blue. Unfortunately, the lady understands only one language. Ever helpful DiamondQuest then told the lady in Mandarin, "Sorry, she eats Western Air." Oh yeah, THANK YOU DQ!  Louis and myself then headed to the foodcourt. DQ said he'd call during his break. He did. At 1600h. We then sat together while the guys ate. I was not hungry. Happily, we all went to SPOTLIGHT. My shopping time. It's great to have two guys hanging around while you shop. LOL. But I think Louis got really bored. He was yawning!!!! But claims it was fatigue. Anyway, I bought pretty glittery Felt material. =) I'm happy. To TIMES bookstore we went (to buy TIME...). Got nothing out of that place. It was almost 1700h. I wanted to go to a Bookshop. Thought of POPULAR (to buy POPULARITY...), so we headed to the one at Chinatown. Perfect. It's the newest and largest branch I assume... Occupying the entire level of The Majestic building.  We bought ourselves chocolates at Watsons (my favorite store!) and headed towards Chinatown. My feet were hurting by then! We cut through Istana Park, and I pointed out the ever romantic B.BOSS out to Louis. Nice place for a date. Good food too.  On the way to Chinatown, we dropped in at Church of the Sacred Heart... We were late already... Mass was at 1730h, we were there at 1740h there about. Sat at the back, where I spotted my slacker sister. Heard from my dad -the big shot- that she takes long lunches and late breakfast during working hours, and now, she's at mass... hmmm...  We left during communion and headed towards Chinatown Point. Gary was there waiting for us.  Gary and office wear just does not gel. No no... I mean, he looked good... But it was strange. LOL. I just burst out laughing.  We headed to POPULAR and bought paper and a huge tube of UHU glue. Those two clowns!!! They could not differentiate tube and stick. LOL. And we were speaking across the level to each other... Them getting the glue, and I at the cashier. JOKERS!  Moving on to Smith Street, I was the Princess while the two clowns went about ordering food. Gary called me a Princess! But they made my order the drinks... The stall holder has a horrible attitude! Anyhow, we were filled to the max, although we did not really order much. We had Stingray!!!! *Yum* We had Popiah... which we could not finish... And GARY!!!! Trust you to have Chindian blood... We could not take the Chilli. Sigh.  DRINK DRINK DRINK is what we needed!  We headed to MacDonalds and Gary ordered Ice Lemon Tea for me. He did not even drink in the end. We crapped our way along and decided we were boring people... Time to head home!  Wonder who's that lady and what was her problem. Staring at us all the way... hmmm.  Anyway,  LOUIS ! I think you'd read this, just want to say a big THANK YOU for today. All the nonsense and GREAT Company!!!! Thanks for sending me all the way back... You really did not have to. Hope you had a good workout jogging your way home! Take care of that wrist of yours!  And yes, to  GARY , you might or might not revisit this, but YES, Louis did send me back. Where were you?! Don't say I did not nurse you back to health. You should be home resting, but instead, you went drinking!!! Thanks for dinner anyway. I hold you to it that you'd buy dinner the next round! And, about calling me FAT! I forgive you... If you'd forgive me for those "jokes" I made... Sorry. I really am.  Oh well, today was a fun filled and exhausting day... Unfortunately, this entry is so dull... I can never seem to write well. It's sad. Plus this entry is so different from the others. It's dull.  Love me tender, Love me true.

      When I need you Just close my eyes and I'm with you And all that I so want to give you It's only a heartbeat away...  I miss you my sweet baby. Darling, it feels so great to hear your voice after this long day. Had practically ZERO contact with you today... Only at lunch and now before your bed time. It still feels so good to hear your assuring voice after a long day. I feel like I've just fallen in love.  I need your love.  Went to town with my sweet cousin... We walked a lot. And ate quite a bit... She did not really eat, I ate. I can be such a pig. We walked from Orchard to Dhoby Ghaut and then to Chinatown. Went into all the shops but bought nothing. I only bought art materials from SPOTLIGHT. Our last destination. And I intend to go back there again tomorrow. Got some more materials so get. Made my list.  Will be meeting up with Louis tomorrow. After so long. Nothing much, just a meal and talk crap I guess. It's been long since we caught up. And both of us have our share of problems that we share with each other... I reckon it's a good time to catch up. Not on lost time, but just to catch up with a long time friend.  Sweet baby, I pray you have a good camp. A safe camp. I went for mass today, dragging my non-Catholic cousin with me. I prayed for us, darling. I prayed for you.  I'm glad to hear you had to run so far!!!! But I really don't want you to slim down too much. Cos I need my man BIG!!!!  I love you babe. I'm awaiting your return...  When I need you Just close my eyes and you lie here by my side Keeping me warm night and day...

      There's a reason...   I miss Him . I miss Him like the day we first met. I miss Him like the day our eyes first met. I miss Him like the day we first fell in love. I miss Him like the day He first pulled me close. I miss Him like the day he first held my hand. I miss Him like the day we first watched the sun set together. I miss Him like the day his lips first touched mine. I miss Him like the day we watched our first show together. I miss Him like the day he first step foot in my home. I miss Him like the day I first step foot in His home. I miss Him like the day we watched our first sunrise together. I miss Him like the day we first shared the bed. I miss Him.  I miss Him. I miss Him for all the wonderful things he has done for me. I miss Him for all the tender moments He has shared with me. I miss Him for all the arguments we had. I miss Him for all the emotions we have shared. I miss Him for all the times He completed my sentences. I miss Him for all the tears we shared. I miss Him for knocking me out of my day dreams. I miss Him for being my shelter. I miss Him for being my protector. I miss Him for all that I am today. I miss Him.  I miss Him. I miss Him for He was always here for me. I miss Him for what he has done. I just miss Him so.  I miss the way his gentle reassuring voice made all my troubles fade away. I miss His voice.  I missed him as strongly at the moment as I did the day we first met. I guess this is what happens when you spend so many happy years with a man.  You never stop missing .  And hurting.  Although the hurt finds places to hide as time goes by.  I stopped, looked up at the sky, and said to GOD, "Thank you for this wonderful life of mine."  I felt a chill... It was a chill of pleasure.

      You're my honey bun sugar cup bumpy humby bumpykin You're my sweetie pie You're my cuppy cake flower gum drop sleeger slooper por The apple of my eye and  I love you so  and I want you know that  I'd always be right here  and I love to sing this song to you because  you are so dear ...  It feels so good. This feeling inside me. This sweetness inside me. This stirring within me. A pleasant one. Feeling all so strawberry.   urlLink     My Sweetheart, My BERRY BEST FRIEND   I hope, Not a fleeting one. I want to be this high. But I don't ask forever. There's no such thing as forever, and daily doses of such tremendous joy would be nothing out of the ordinary.  I want to be with you, until the end of time. I'd never stop loving you. I've never stopped loving the one before. I just keep falling deeper. And you're the one to take it all.  It was a fantastic evening. So fantastic, my limited vocabulary is unable to describe. It might have been a simple two hours. A simple but sweet one.  It felt so good, it felt so right.  We finally met up for mass after what seemed like forever. It was a nice celebration. I truly enjoy being there with you.  Although dinner was simple, with intruders, no lack. I still had a good time. We both did. It was so simple yet so enriching.  I loved the look on your face. The little smiles you'd give me. Those sparkling eyes of yours.  A walk to remember indeed. For I have not felt this good in months. I'm glad I stuck on stubbornly to taking the public bus instead of hailing a cab. I appreciate your thoughtfulness tremendously, but buses are more romantic. Furthermore my dear, your worry was put to rest when you escorted me along the way to the bus stop. No worries of me having to walk that distance without you.  I think buses are more romantic. Still, I'm thankful you'd be getting your car soon. Then I can finally taste the Hokkien Mee you've told me so much about, and You can finally taste the Hokkien Mee I've told you so much about, and We can go on our food hunt with much more convenience.   urlLink     This is our all time favorite - Hokkien Mee   Thank you for the effort and thoughtfulness this evening.  This kiss, the best ever.  I LOVE YOU my sweet baby.

      Forgot about the Lord, Remembered only now. So lost, so confused, so alone. Here alone you sit. Unable to make up your mind.  Trying to multi-task when you are so confused as it is. Trying to resolve not so important things when your life is a mess.  Focus is what you need at the moment, Time out alone is the best for you. I think it's time you did a good workout. Have a good time under the sun. Look at your tone now. You look like a big chunk of fat.  Gross.  The sun is ever so inviting, but you are too ashamed. Hidden in the darkness of the night, Hidden behind the shades so wide.  The glistening waters across from here, the stare you so afraid to face. Ashamed of your reflection. Ashamed of your entire being.  Lonely, outkasted, strained. It's time to move away. You want to run, you want to cry. You want to sleep, you want to shop. You want a new life, but you never want to face it.  I question. I seek. I think. I reflect. Sometimes I see things, sometimes I do not. A shower might be of help.  You confuse me so... One moment you're ok, the next you flare. You want me to be happy. I want you to be happy.  I want to end the night happy with you. I want to have a good night's sleep. I want to have a sweet sweet dream. I want to wake up assured that I'm still in your life.  I need your strong arms around me. I need to know you're there. I know you held me tight last night. But then again I fled.  I hurt when you liberally said you'd get someone else to do the job. It hurt because it was an intimate thing we shared. It's an emotion I felt only connected between the two of us.  Like you mentioned, We know each other all so well, yet we hurt each other all so much.  Life is such a big big race. Round the track we race and fall. The spinning gets me all down and low.   urlLink     If only life could be so easy   I hardly know what I write.

      ... Nobody wants to cry  The turn of the tides the speed of the flow You're submerged before you know You yelp and paddle to no avail  He pushes you down He downright does "Stupid" he says "Stupidest thing ever!"  All I wanted was a little support Where were you when I needed you?  "You never listen" I try so damn hard.  "You never agreed immediately" I look for alternatives.  "What's wrong with you" Nothing I say. Absolutely nothing.  How it crushes you when you think you're doing all so fine. When you feel you're being the best you can. You're gentle, loving, understanding, patient and kind.  He expects nothing from you he says Yet he demands complete obdience, or you make all decisions.  Confused indeed I am.  Unable to stand for myself I fear.  A failure in your own right. A loser in your realm.  You decided upon an act, you stick to that.  Today's date will be the last. Tomorrow come all contact seize. Discipline and healing will have to come.  Let go my friend, it's time to part.  Like he said, If you cant then you cant be his wife.  You say, You have the fear of losing him, yet reality hits that perhaps you two aren't made for each other.  Perhaps perhaps perhaps.  Back to square one I gather.  Perhaps perhaps perhaps.  Tomorrow could be a better day.  I'm lost I'm confused.  School seems to draw nearer, I cannot decide between reluctance and enthusiasium.  What a Moron.

      The following message was circulated for ages on the internet. It speaks so truly about us sinners. It's time to do a little self reflection. Perhaps as one reads this, they say, "Another day." Make sure the "another day" comes... If you doubt the "another day" would come, I urge you to read and reflect now.   PROCRASTINATION IS THE THIEF OF TIME .  We try to keep God in church on Sunday morning...  Maybe, Sunday night...  And, the unlikely event of a midweek service.   We do like to have Him around during sickness...  And, of course, at funerals.   However, we don't have time, or room, for Him during work or play...  Because... That's the part of our lives we think.. We can, and should, handle on our own.  May God forgive me for ever thinking...  That... there is a time or place where...  HE is not to be FIRST in my life.   We should always have time to remember all HE has done for us.    Jesus said, "If you are ashamed of me, I will be ashamed of you before my Father."   Not ashamed?    Mean what you say...   Yes, I do Love God . HE is my source of existence and Savior.  He keeps me functioning each and every day. Without Him, I will be nothing. Without Him, I am nothing. But,  with Christ, HE strengthens me . ( Phil 4:13 )  This is the simplest test.   If You Love God... And, are not ashamed of all the marvelous things HE has done for you...   Do You love Him?   THE POEM   I knelt to pray but not for long,  I had too much to do. I had to hurry and get to work For bills would soon be due.  So I knelt and said a hurried prayer,  And jumped up off my knees.  My Christian duty was now done  My soul could rest at ease.  All day long I had no time  To spread a word of cheer. No time to speak of Christ to friends,  They'd laugh at me I'd fear.   No time, no time, too much to do,  That was my constant cry,  No time to give to souls in need  But at last the time, the time to die.   I went before the Lord, I came, I stood with downcast eyes. For in his hands God held a book; It was  the book of life .   God looked into his book and said  "Your name I cannot find.  I once was going to write it down...  But never found the time"    Now do you have the time for HIM?    Easy vs. Hard    Why is it so hard to tell the truth but Yet so easy to tell a lie?  Why are we so sleepy in church  but Right when the sermon is over we suddenly wake up?   Why is it so hard to talk about God but yet so easy to talk about nasty stuff?   Why is it so boring to look at a Christian magazine, but yet so easy to look at a nasty one?   Why is it so easy to delete a Godly e-mail, but yet we forward all of the nasty ones?   Why are the churches getting smaller but yet the bars and dance clubs are getting larger?    Do you give up ? Think about it.  Just remember- God is watching you .   Of all the free gifts we may receive, Prayer is the very best one....  There are no costs, but wonderful rewards...   GOD BLESS !   May God keep you and bless you. If this doesn't give you chills, nothing will...this message is very true. Hope you are all as blessed as I was from this story.  There once was a man named George Thomas, pastor in a small New England town. One Easter Sunday morning he came to the Church carrying a rusty, bent, old bird cage, and set it by the pulpit. Eyebrows were raised and, as if in response, Pastor Thomas began to speak..."I was walking through town yesterday when I saw a young boy coming toward me swinging this bird cage. On the bottom of the cage were three little wild birds, shivering with cold and fright. I stopped the lad and asked, "What you got there, son?" "Just some old birds," came the reply.   "What are you gonna do with them?" I asked.   "Take 'em home and have fun with 'em," he answered "I'm gonna tease 'em and pull out their feathers to make 'em fight. I'm gonna have a real good time." "But you'll get tired of those birds sooner or later. What will you do?"   "Oh, I got some cats," said the little boy.   "They like birds. I'll take 'em to them."   The pastor was silent for a moment. "How much do you want for those birds, son?"  "Huh?? !!! Why, you don't want them birds, mister. They're just plain old field birds. They don't sing. They ain't even pretty!"   "How much?" the pastor asked again.   The boy sized up the pastor as if he were crazy and said, "$10?"   The pastor reached in his pocket and took out a ten dollar bill. He placed it in the boy's hand. In a flash, the boy was gone. The pastor picked up the cage and gently carried it to the end of the alley where there was a tree and a grassy spot. Setting the cage down, he opened the door, and by softly tapping the bars persuaded the birds out, setting them free.   Well, that explained the empty bird cage on the pulpit, and then the pastor began to tell this story.   One day Satan and Jesus were having a conversation. Satan had just come from the Garden of Eden, and he was gloating and boasting. "Yes, sir, I just caught the world full of people down there. Set me a trap, used bait I knew they couldn't resist. Got 'em all."  "What are you going to do with them?" Jesus asked.   Satan replied, "Oh, I'm gonna have fun!  I'm gonna teach them how to marry and divorce each other, how to hate and abuse each other, how to drink and smoke and curse. I'm gonna teach them how to invent guns and bombs and kill each other.  I'm really gonna have fun!"  "And what will you do when you get done with them?" Jesus asked. "Oh, I'll kill 'em," Satan glared proudly.   "How much do you want for them?" Jesus asked.   "Oh, you don't want those people. They ain't no good. Why, you'll take them and they'll just hate you.  They'll spit on you, curse you and kill you . You don't want those people!!"   "How much?" He asked again.   Satan looked at Jesus and sneered, " All your blood, tears and your life ."   Jesus said, "DONE!"   Then  He paid the price .   The pastor picked up the cage he opened the door and he walked from the pulpit.   Notes: Isn't it funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why the world's going to hell.  Isn't it funny how someone can say "I believe in God" but still follow Satan (who, by the way, also "believes" in God).   Isn't it funny how you can send a thousand jokes through e-mail and they spread like wildfire, but when you start sending messages regarding the Lord, people think twice about sharing?  Isn't it funny how I can be more worried about what other people think of me than what God thinks of me.

      I'm glad I found You I'm not sure I'm ready for you, or that I deserve you. But I have a lot of strong feelings for you.  Life is strange, isn't it? I never ever thought there would be anyone else in my life again. Just when you think you have a sure thing in your hand, it all falls apart, and you have to start at the beginning.  And then you think your life is over, it starts again, and you get another chance.  Maybe that's what makes life worth living.  I can't believe I'd be right for you. Our lives are very different. But who knows, maybe this is the best thing that ever happened to either of us.

      Ephesians 4:26-27 Be angry if you must, but do not sin: do not let your anger outlast the sunset: do not give the Devil his chance.  I want to praise and thank God.  For the chance to experience Him and find Him. For bringing me back to Him. For giving me the grace to be generous. For answering my prayers. For giving me patience and understanding.  Lonely and down I was. Through Him I climbed my way up.   I want to be happy like before .   I thank God for last night. The ability to speak my mind, and find peace for my restless heart. The chance God gave me to trash things out.  There are still issues I need to settle, through Him, I know I will some day, some how. In His time.

      Revealing your purpose in me, as I'm dreaming of you...  Life has never been so simple. The hectic and high society life I had back here, they were all but hypocritical. Never contented with what I had. Never learnt to enjoy the simple joys in life. Took things for granted and never appreciative.  A simple game of ball, was all that was needed to bring smiles to the little children of Tanjong Balai. The young and old alike. All so contented with the things GOD blessed them with. Their hospitality, warmth and faith in the Almighty. I'm ashamed. They are more human than we can ever be.   Mark 12:38-44  In the course of his teaching Jesus said, "Beware of the scribes, who like to go around in long robes and accept greetings in the marketplaces, seats of honour at banquets. They devour the houses of widows and, as a pretext, recite lengthy prayers. They will receive severe condemnation." He sat down opposite the treasury and observed how the crowd put money into the treasury. Many rich people put in large sums. A poor widow also came and put in two small coins worth a few cents. Calling his disciples to himself, he said to them, "Amen I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all the other contributors to the treasury. For they have all contributed from their surplus wealth, but she, from her poverty, has contributed all she had, her whole livelihood."  Somehow, I always interpret things differently from others, even though we all read the same words. The above gospel touched me in more ways than one. I've heard it many times over, and I fondly recall the one time I heard and stored this gospel. After this trip to Tanjong Balai, this passage means a whole lot more to me. It is not "just words". The people of Tanjong Balai, they are the widow in the parable. How materialistically poor they were, they gave us all that they could offer. The amount of food we consumed from them on our trip, could probably last them a few months, but they were so generous. They gave us more than we could eat. I witnessed their love and sacrifice for us. They did not have much 'materials' but they had a lot of love and faith. They trust in the LORD to provide. On the third day of our visit, I saw for myself how they sacrificed their food. We were all having a jolly good time 'fine dining' at the front yard, and when we finished, I took a walk to the back yard, and saw all they had was plain rice, and curry gravy. I felt so guilty. There I was complaining about the food.  Upon arrival at the Tanjong Balai jetty, we were greeted by the one and only priest on the island, and escorted to the church which was just behind the jetty. The church was small and simple. Just about 50 metres by 4 metres. And that's the biggest church they had. We were then loaded onto little buses made of wood. It ferried 20 persons. What an experience. One should never complain about the SBS buses in Singapore. The road was all dirt tracks, and it was freaking dusty. I was seated facing the road travelling backwards, and the dust just kept flying and getting to my eyes. It was an awesome experience. We then settled into the dormitory at Immanuel Community. Next to the nunnery. We had four cubicles each for the guys and girls, and girls could use the toilets at the nunnery. We had bunk beds, as well as mattresses on the floor. The toilets had no flush, and we bathed with water from the well. The water contained nutrients that made your hair all nice and soft... and free hair dye. Seriously. The kids there have nice and streaked hair. How much money have you all spent colouring your hair?! Even the love of my life asked if I collared my hair again recently. LOL. NO! I'm not intending to spoil my hair any further. After we settled into the hostel, we then proceeded outside to mingle with the local community. The children seem to have appeared out of nowhere! They were quite shy at the beginning, and ran away whenever they were approached. However, when the games started, they all warmed up. I sat and people watched like I always did. Perched by the side of the Basketball court, I watched the girls on the opposite side, standing in a circle and dancing away, the guys on the court playing a game of volleyball, and another two groups on either sides playing soccer. I watched how a simple game of volley put the smile on their faces, while back home, where we had the luxury of playing volley in school etc, and we'd sometimes cringe at the thought. We then had a "tournament". I'd say I'm amazed by their sportsmanship. Very sporting, very humble, very friendly. I would say they have a competitive spirit, yet they are not vicious. Athletes here, be ashamed. Be very ashamed. I finally took to the field, and played in the "tournament". How embarrassing!!! But then again, it was fun. Later in the evening, we had Stations of the Cross, in Bahasa Indonesia. The stations were out in the wilderness. It was dark, and all we had was candlelight. It was an experience. Surprise surprise!! No mosquito bite. After that, we had mass, Indonesian style. It lasted for more than an hour. Daily mass here last half an hour. According to my Indonesian friend, SugarEstasy, Indonesian masses stretched for as long as two hours. They enjoy rubber time there. It was followed by fellowship, also Indonesian style. They had a welcome dance for us, and started many of us thinking... They have a cultural dance for us, but if they were to visit us, what culture do we have? That evening we had a lot of dancing and singing. I did not take part. Spectator as usual. It was a very personal thought, decision and feeling. I had an early night. The following day, it was time to get dirty. I joined the guys to do manual labour. We planted trees, and it was very tiring, but fun. I was so exhausted and dehydrated, I was shaking and out of my mind. We then had lunch and it was leisure the rest of the day. Some went to play soccer, some just stayed behind to chit chat. I stayed. We climbed Coconut trees and enjoyed fresh coconut. Some said it tasted like hundred plus, some said it was alcohol. LOL. I say, it was shiok. We then returned to the hostel and took a shower. We then returned to the community for Mass. We left the musicians behind... Namely, Clem, Dan, and My babe. It was a blessing in disguise. Half way through mass, there was a blackout!!! It was an experience too... Like in the olden days. Nothing but candles on the altar. Cool. It was a blessing as, God was truly watching over us. Leaving the musicians behind was a stupid move, as they were suppose to play for mass, but it was a blessing, as the blackout affected the whole neighbourhood, which meant our dorm was also affected. There were ladies half way through their shower when the blackout occurred. If the guys had not been around, it would have been pretty disastrous. The guys were the ones with the huge torches and they were better at handling such situations. Praise be to GOD. That evening, we had "Worshipping God Indonesian style". It is similar to how we do it here. Sharing etc. I was saddened when the local priest said he felt what they did was not good enough. I appreciate their effort, and it just wasn't right to say it was not good enough. On the third day, we went to another community and I did health screening while the guys did tiling, and some stayed at Immanuel to teach. I did the BMI part of the screening, and generally, the children are underweight, the ladies were overweight, and the gentlemen were underweight. Sad. We then had mass in the open. Complete with dogs running between our legs, chicken flapping across the altar. I found that interesting. Seriously. I had to visit the toilet there... It was a tiny hut, with a tiny door, and basically, a hole in the ground. It was of smell. LOL. We headed back to the dorm, and spent the evening, "Worshipping God Singaporean style". We had Praise and Worship and Intercessory prayer. It was a very powerful and spirit filled evening. It shows that it does not matter which language you use to praise God, or what instruments you use.  I had a good time on the trip.  It was worth the while . The time. It was all so good. It made me feel real stupid. It made me realise how poor and sad I really was. It was a humbling experience. On the final day, we had mass with the children of Immanuel. The joy on their faces when we presented the school with books and balls. It was amazing. The children's participation during the mass was just so awesome. The youths here ought to be ashamed.   I am not doing justice with this lousy piece of writing. I apologise.   Unfortunately, upon arrival back on this place on earth, it all came tumbling down. It crashed down way too fast. Nigeria Falls.  I crumble and fall.  Oh God, be my protector and refuge.

      You looked wonderful tonight... You were wonderful tonight... The warmth of your sweet caress, The beating of your generous heart, Makes me fall in love with you, All over again.   urlLink     You looked wonderful tonight...   The feeling of falling in and out of love, it's all too familiar now. The ups and the downs, We take them both.  Sometimes I just want to let you go, Sometimes I just want to run away.  The up times are so high, I fear the fleeting drunkenness.  I know I should not think too much. I should just enjoy the moment. Enjoy the love we share.  I adore you. You looked wonderful tonight.  That was a nice shirt you wore. Very classy.  You looked wonderful tonight. You were wonderful tonight.  Although it started as a heart wrenching evening, And I wanted to run, You made it all alright, When you showed you cared.  We both miss the good old days, I'm glad we relive those moments together.  I love you Babe.

      Once again, it's the Feast Day of the Immaculate Heart of Mary Church. Once again, we gathered with the people of GOD for a big celebration. We had a high mass celebrated by HIS GRACE, the Archbishop of Singapore...   urlLink     We are all GOD's children.   The tables were set, the crowd was rowdy. The chatter of the people, the clicking of the cameras. It was a simple yet joyful evening.   urlLink     One big JOYFUL family...   The family of ZION's JOY were gathered at the same table, sharing the food provided by the Almighty. I'm pretty sure, we had a great evening.  Although the food was not all that good, the company was there.  We've yet another dinner tomorrow evening, I'm looking forward to it, although I said earlier, I don't want to be there.  My babe, will bring me rounding after the dinner. I'm excited.  Some last words, I might get myself on the crew of the IDOL show... WOO HOO!!!

It went by with a snap of the finger. I'm bewitched.  I'm honored to be your greatest fan I can't comprehend this. How do I answer to her? How do I tell him?   urlLink     My fellow funny man... I'm going to miss you dearly...   If only we could all go away together. Then we could all get out doses of comedy. Never thought of myself as a comedian, I guess you brought that out of me.  You looked wonderful tonight.  I'm not looking forward to your farewell party. That only means you'd be gone soon.  Only to return in three months time. With my dear sister and you out of town, Where will I go?  Thanks for the prayerful evening, The warmth of your hand, The power of your prayer. I pray for your safety, I pray for you.  One thing for sure,  I'd miss you.  I sure will.

      Babe, It's the 18th once again. And we're planning three months ahead. It'd be great to have the car for the evening. Especially since September 18th falls on a Saturday.  I can't wait. I really can't.  I just pray I won't be disappointed.  I won't have anyone to run to but to you.  My dear sister will be far from home by then, where else can I run to?  My dear Clown will be out of town, who will bring the Comedian out of me?  No one else but you.  Thank you for the wonderful two years.  I'm taken aback by you not remembering how you proposed though... And I'm pretty upset about you forgetting the years. But I'm over it.  I'm bewitched.

      Deep inside she longed for you. She kept it all within For she knew it'd never be true. Disappointment engulfs her heart more often than not. She wants to hurt no more.  She tried to run, she tried to leave. You came and grabbed her tight. And promised you'd never let her go. You promised you'd never let her hurt again.  She trusted you. She gave her whole to you. She opened her life to you. She welcomed you with open arms. She held you all so tight.  Too tight it seems. Now you want to run. And she lets you. For hurt she wants no more. For you she'd do without.  Today she spoke the truth. Today she showed she cared. Today you showed you cared. But still you broke her heart.  She wanted you to stay. If only you would stay. She asked for you to stay, but you refused her.  She hurts so deep inside. She wants to cry, but can't. She'd grant that wish to you. She'd let you leave with no qualms.  Don't ask to see her again. Don't say "I'd see you later." Don't make her promises. cause you've broken her up enough.  I have had enough. You'd never see me fall apart...

      The balls are hurting. Heels or no heels. They hurt. They hurt like you've just been punched on your cheek bone. They hurt.  With or without going downtown, Business District was enough to kill.  One thing I miss about the airport, I miss the Irish lads.  Saw a few along the river today.   urlLink     Skyscrapers... Post-card-que   A trio.  Cheerio.

      ...across the sea...  Why are you hurting when you should be happy? Why are you crying when he cares? Why are you doubtful when he's kind? Why don't you trust anymore?  He might have thought of her today. He might have cried for her today. He might feel for her one day. He might go for good some day.  It was time for him to close the chapter and move on. This evening was the right time. He has to let this deep wound heal. He has to know you are there for him.  She might have hurt him oh so much, He might have loved her with all his might. But there he stood by your side. There he held your hand so dear.  The hurt she caused, the fear she inflicted, You can do nothing, but to love him more.  You crash and burn, You have to learn.  He may be here, but he might be gone.  Give him your prayers and your support. Give him space and much needed rest.  He'd be yours if he was meant to be.   Who's going to drive you home tonight?

      * Don't be too cold, I'd be sad. Don't be too loving, I'd run and hide. Don't be too sweet, I'd get worried. *   Congratulations Babe!!! I finally get an  Ahmad  to call my own. Congratulations Baby.   There's a reason...  Tadpole Kuah resurfaced in my window this evening. No more loud bangs and loud screams. Just cool hellos.  You wonder why... We did not part on too good terms. We've matured through the years.

      ...If living is without you?  How am I to live without you? Out here alone in this sunny city. The passion within envelopes me and is about to engulf me whole.  I can't go on. I can't live. I can't breathe anymore.  I need your sympathy, I need your breath.  Don't play me out just when I need you most.  Emotions taking me over. I cry a loud loud cry.  Don't take my air vent away from me.

      I gave you my love... But look what it's done to me...   What's the name of the game? Does it mean anything to you?   What's the name of the game?  Are you feeling it the way I do?  Tell me please cause I've got to know...  I trusted you, but you let me down. How fast the tide changes. One moment you were laughing and joking and cuddling. The next, you're silent and distant, and there she lay crying.   You left her with a tear yet again. You left her with a shattered heart. You left her hanging on her own .  She grew silently still, you tugged at her shoulder, she smeared her tears on the pillow, and smiled at you. You looked away.  Once again, she was drowning in her silent tears. You never hear.  She asked out of concern. You felt trapped. You felt like a prisoner, and she was there interrogating you.  She meant no harm. Yet you yelled.  She wants to give you space, but she needs a little respect.  You are her life. You are all she lives for.  Yet you pierced her once again.  You've got her all wrong. You've got her all mangled up.  Tears fell once again when you said "Can't I be left to do my own things? You question everything."  It sounds all too familiar. It happened to the generation before her, and now it's happening to her.  She fears but she has nowhere to run to. She's lost, she longs for your comfort, but you are unaware.  Tears are her only comfort. Silent tears are what she sheds when she's with you. Sometimes she's careless at concealing, but as time goes by, she manages to fool you. She hides her true sadness.  Made a silent promise to herself through her tears: I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again. I'll never ask to see him again.  Silently she made you a promise, a promise you helped her keep when you walked off just like that.  I heard you're painting the town red again.

      Missing you so, My heart aches so bad.  Shattered and mended, It'd never be the same again.  Young and sweet, we ruined it all.  We had the time of our lives, I don't want it to end so soon.  I do wish to be like them in certain ways, Yet I want to be unique.  Unique like you say you are.  Individualistic you say you are.  Mushy stuff ain't for you.  Perhaps You ought to be alone.  But I love you so.  I want you so.  Seeing you today, I was delighted, yet you left me with nothing but heartache.  He asked me for a favour, A simple yet sweet favour. He wanted me to keep his gal company.  Where were you?  What was your reason? You are not the mushy type, and not the character that I want. I have to accept you for who you are.  Think of me...

      One third through, Ache the whole way down.  Preparation is tedious Preparation is enjoyable.  End result is satisfying.  The smile on your face is the sweetest of it all.  The look on your face says it all.  The beat in our hearts, seals it all.

      The world never stops. Time never stops. Men wait for none.  The Congress was plain. Over rated.   urlLink     Feeling up and about after the Eucharistic Congress   Got out on the wrong side of the bed today. The world was spinning, My head was splitting.  Procrastinated appearing at the gathering. Awaited Dad's return. Wonderfully crappy lunch.  The fried rice was awesomely disgusting. Something was telling me, "Don't eat it."  Heading to the stadium, I felt sick.  Perhaps it was the weather, Perhaps it was the alcohol, Perhaps it was just me.  Collected the things, Awaited your news.  Nothing came, Again I ask.  Time went by, the comfort room, I came a knocking.  It all came out. I spilled my guts out. I took care of it myself.  Where were you when I was cold? Where were you when I was lost? Where were you when I needed someone to hold? Where were you when I needed you? Where are you in my life?  Again, I try. The phone rang, and it was you. I thought of heaven, I thought of you.  All that came, was just my tears.  Again, I try. You choose. You gave me up.  The grass is always greener on the other side.  I wish you the very best.   When you love someone, You'd want him to be happy, Even if his happiness means you are not part of it.

      Cause I missed you...  Why is it always this way, Why is it always me?  Is this a game? Is this how I lost?  Cause I never knew the rules of the game. Kept breaking and bending, Kept running and hiding. I never want to learn the rules. I play my game.  The words were so harsh, It cut so deep. I wish you here, But you were gone.  Never one to say too much, Never one to tell you love. Words that were missed, Time cannot return.  I long for you, This is but my foolishness. I fumble, I crumble, I fall.  Have yet to see you, Have yet to tell you how much I cared.  I guess they matter not to you.  For this is but a game.  A foolish game of love.  I played the game, I broke the rules, I pay the price.

      Amazing how you touched my heart again today. You nearly brought me to tears. You nearly got me on my knees. You nearly floored me.  I think I know where you want me to be. I've decided to stay. I've decided to commit. I've decided to do my best, and contribute in whatever way I can.  I've decided to take on a more pro-active role. I've decided to make this my motto to...   SEEK YE FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD .  I'd say I dared not take on the role on the Core team as I was worried about my studies. But as I was telling my dear friend that I've decided to stay on in  Zion's Joy , I was about to say I'm worried about coping with studies, the phrase just came,  SEEK YE FIRST .  I think I know where I'd be heading, at least for the next six months. I'm heading the Confirmation Music team, and I feel this is where I should be. I want to worship. I want to serve.  Although I'm dead tired, I just have to make this entry. I had only three hours of sleep last night, and I went for the ZJ Retreat, although I was faced with many temptations to turn away. I went and I saw.  My eyes were opened. My heart was opened.  Amazingly, throughout the few hours I was there, I did not even think of my own fatigue. And I actually confessed to the whole group that I had intentions of leaving. I felt like leaving the group as I felt I was not growing in the group, and I was not contributing in any way. But I guess, after the Mission Trip, things changed. Although I said it was going to be my last camp, I've changed my mind about that too.  I'd want to administer to the newly baptized people of Christ the King, in their LISS camp. I want to use HIS gift to me to help. I want to be HIS instrument.  I will run to You.  You were there when I was down, You were there when I rejoiced. You are here by my side.

      You squint, you rub, you force your eyes to open. You managed. You won. You were disappointed. A lousy conclusion it was. Staying up just to complete the book. What a lousy conclusion. Sam should not have been gassed. He should have lived. I wanted him to live. I thought there would be a twist at the end. A happy ending. I like happy endings. I love to deceive myself with fairy tale endings. I refuse to watch drama serials with sad, unfortunate endings. I want to watch only happy endings.  Flipped open another today. I'm re-reading. I can only vaguely remember the story line. But I know it. I know I hate the guy's guts. But I want to read it. I admire the lady.  It happened like a dream. I floated away with the time. Met you today. You looked weary. I was tired.  Silence is golden. I treasure every second of it. I love being home alone. I want to be left alone. Him entering only means tension. He enjoys watching Satanic shows. He's sick. Sick up there. I would not discuss him further.  Funny man is leaving tomorrow evening. 2100h. I would not be able to see him before he leaves. It's going to be 3 months before we meet again. I'd miss him. God Bless My friend.  Babe, sweet dreams to you. Get well soon, we have plenty to do.

      I'm dedicating this entry to  TONY PARSONS . He has captivated me. His works. They're good. When I first picked up his book,  Man and Boy , from DAD's library, I flipped the page, and put the book back on the shelf.   urlLink     Tony Parsons' Man and Boy   "Not my type", I thought.  Few months down the road, I picked the book off the shelf again, and read it. I was caught. I could not put the book down. It kicked off my bookworm days again. It made me itch for more books.  Here's a little write up on  Tony Parsons ...  Tony Parsons was born in 1955 in a blue-collar family in Essex, the East End of London. Although he had already written a novel at the age of seventeen, he worked at the Gordon's gin distillery in London until summer 1976, when he started working for the NME (New Musical Express) as a punk journalist. This took him on the road with bands like The Sex Pistols.   He married Julie Burchill, a fellow NME journalist, and they had a son, Bobby, before divorcing. When Tony Parsons was 29 years old, he was awarded custody of his four-year-old son. And nothing was ever the same again...  Tony Parsons is the son of a former Marine who was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal in World War II, the second highest award for valor in the British armed forces. These two relationships&#151;with the son he raised alone, and with the late father he worshipped&#151;form the spine and the heart of Man and Boy.   Tony Parsons is one of the most well-known writers in England. In the seventies he was a music journalist for NME, the British equivalent of Rolling Stone. His interviews with the likes of The Clash, Sex Pistols, Blondie, Talking Heads and Ramones made him a cult figure among the youth of England. Parsons won awards for his journalism in the eighties for his work as a roving reporter for magazines such as GQ and Elle. In the nineties he became one of the most famous faces on British television, spending six years as one of the regular guests on BBC&#146;s Late Review, a program that was a cross between Politically Incorrect and the Algonquin round table.  In 1999 he published a novel, Man and Boy, that has taken the British bestseller lists by storm. In 2001 Man and Boy was published in America.  He has a regular column in The Mirror and participates in the BBC arts programs, Newsnight Review. He has also written for, among other publications, The Face, Marie Claire, The Daily Mail, Arena, The Guardian, Elle, The Daily Telegraph, The Spectator, The Sunday Times, GQ and Red.   He has now re-married, and lives in London.

      Shivering in the cold, We huddled close together. Hand in hand, we struggled to make a fire.  Through the night, I made the choice. I chose the longest show to catch. That was a mistake.  We shivered for the two hours. You stiffened and closed your eyes. I struggled to keep my warmth and provide you comfort. Looking up at you, I asked if we should leave. You shook your head and said, "I'm fine. Watch."  I was worried sick. Offered you my jacket, You smiled and again, you shut up eyes. You thanked me for the warmth.  I guess that dream freaked you out. I know you want me near. I know the fear within you. I want to reassure you.  I liked the way you drew me near to you. Your gentle warmth, you honeyed lips.  I really need you to get well soon. I am indeed really worried about you.  It was a good show none the less.

       Meet the extended family . Well, at least my dearly missed cousin who's currently based in England, and leading a jet-set lifestyle. Supposedly back for three weeks, she'd be jetting off to Hongkong come Monday, to shop. That lucky girl. Shopaholic! It probably runs in the blood right?   urlLink     Meet the Family   Thank You BABY, for coming down to pick me up and send all of us back after supper. It was very sweet of you... Although I do feel very bad about it. It's nice to finally meet an extended family right?  Once again, we walked and we walked. We bought nothing but loads and loads of food. Plus I bought a Tony Parsons' book...  One for My Baby . For only three eighty. What a steal!!!   urlLink     Tony Parsons' One for My Baby   I want to get the other book,  Man and Wife .    urlLink     Tony Parsons' Man and Wife   Anyone with the book, wanting to sell? Leave me a note!  Got high on Orange Juice, and dined on expensive Irish food. Yep, like Daddy said, "You buy nothing less than five bucks right?" Sure hope you liked the wrappo Dad. I adore it. It's so healthy. And it's IRISH.  I enjoyed the sing-a-long session last night. Though we hardly got warmed up, I finally got to sing!!! After so very long. Finally. And I enjoyed the run of drink. Cool DAD!!!   Now, what's next for this tiny holiday of mine?

It was pretty uneventful. Time crawled by, and I met a few kind faces.  A lost Mom.  Asians speaking foreign tongues...  Foreign Mandarin tongue. I gasp. I smile.  Foreigners attempting the English Language. Some are hilarious. You are hilarious. You are welcome to visit this place anytime you like. I'm not sorry I declined you. But you are still welcomed here. No, I do not give out my number freely.  My babe's in camp now... I miss him dearly. Wish he was here with me. It was great hearing his voice.  I love you babe. See you soon.

       urlLink     Our First Parking Coupon!!!   The feeling is just so wonderful. The ride of my life. My babe.  Gallantly you approached, With your car parked silently before my door. You smiled, I smiled, You walked me to the car, and we were on our way.  The ride of my life.  I'm so proud of you my dear.  Mass was over before I knew it, and we were heading out to dinner. I know you're still shakened by the mysterious car. So was I. It had appeared out of nowhere, and PRAISE the LORD, We were being taken care of by HIM above.  It was no fault of yours. You had the right of way, and that feller came from the slip road. You were real good.  Thank You for this evening darling.

      Woke up to the lovely sunshine. The glow on your face. The radiance of your smile.  I felt good. Went for a nice run this morning. The sun shining gloriously down upon me... Everything seems right.  It's strange this feeling inside me. The unspeakable fear. I wonder who the culprit is. I can only pray for him.  God bless him.  Vandalism is a crime. It is punishable by law, and needless to say, Punishable by GOD.  He knows our every move. Don't wait for judgment day to repent. Repent now. Admit your wrongdoing and seek forgiveness.  It's disgusting whoever committed the crime. Yes, CRIME.  It may seem like a peanut matter, but it is still an offence.  I sure hope it was all captured on tape. You can't run far.  You can hide, But GOD above knows exactly what you did and where you hide.  Be it an accident, a case of mistaken identity, or revengeful purposes, You have picked on the wrong family. We are GOD fearing people. But we do not and will not fear you.  We can only pray for you.  GOD bless.

      A time for us Someday there'll be, When chains are torn By courage born Of a love that's free.  A time when dreams So long denied Can flourish as we unveil The love we now must hide.  A time for us at last To see a life worthwhile For you and me. And our love through tears and thorns We will endure, As we pass surely through every storm.  A time for us Someday there'll be A new world, A world of shining hope for you and me.  I love you babe.

      Haven't seen you for two weeks now. And I don't miss you anymore. I'm looking forward to your return, but for now, I do not miss you a single bit. I know she misses you. I'm glad you both are still in constant contact. Don't let either one fall too hard alright?  Hunger pangs might greet me again in the morning. Supper caused it all. Finally visited the Market for lunch. I sure hope they tear down that pathetic place soon. Babe says it'd happen this year. My ambitious Sista hopes it'd be like Taka S.C. A mall with lots of good food - Italian and Mexican - and shops where I can get my art materials and nail stuff will be good enough, I'm not too demanding.  *Note: SISTA!! You won't even be around to enjoy the place man! You've bigger better Malls up where you're headed! Just keep an eye for stuff - you know what! - for me ok!  All in all, today was a great day. I got to see my Babe. I got to Praise HIM.  I'm happy.  One more thing... HAPPY BIRTHDAY P!!!!!! I've no idea who your current husband is so... Cheerio! See you soon ok Babes!

      Spidey Man!!! The "song" is ringing at the back of my head. What a good laugh.  Hunger pangs start to hit me first thing in the morning. I have not felt this pang for a very long time. I have not eaten like I did the day before today. Eating every hour is not my kind of thing. Eating is not even what I do anymore.  I had a great time.  I miss the popcorn already.

      Inconsistency. Mocha. Once it tasted like Coco. Today it tasted like Coffee. Which is better? Both makes me tingle. Both give me the chills. My limps go weak. My heart rate races.  Finally got to critic Eternal Sunshine. Media people watching the show towards the closing instead of the preview. Tried and tested. Abstract.  Nadine's a writer with our local paper. DUDE! Have not seen her since 2001! Whooping three years. THREE YEARS. And viola! She's a free lance journalist with the local paper. Mind you, she has yet to start Uni... yeah. Cool.  Mania Mania! Finally. The craving was fulfilled. Creamy.   Now I want to eat tomato.

       THE BEATITUDES   Seeing the crowds, he went up the hill. There he sat down and was joined by his disciples. Then he began to speak. This is what he taught them:      'How happy are the poor in spirit, theirs is the kingdom of heaven.      Happy the gentle: they shall have the earth for their heritage.      Happy those who mourn: they shall be comforted.      Happy those who hunger and thirst for what is right: they shall be satisfied.      Happy the merciful: they shall have mercy shown them.      Happy the pure in heart: they shall see God.      Happy the peacemakers: they shall be called sons of God.      Happy those who are persecuted in the cause of right: theirs is the kingdom of heaven.'  'Happy are you when people abuse you and persecute you and speak all kinds of calumny against you on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven; this is how they persecuted the prophets before you.'   First session of the catechism for Adults -  You are Called . It was a basic and relatively dry session this evening. But it was motivational. I've made the commitment to be there on a regular - attend every session - basis. To journey with my aunt and my cousin. I benefit from it too. It's catechism all over again, but things have changed. I've grown up. I'm learning something new everyday. I want to be sure of where I'd go if I do not awake to the lovely sunshine tomorrow morning.  In my younger days, it was compulsory for me to attend at least 80% of the class, or I'd never "graduate" from Sunday school. Thus, I was always the last to enter the Cat Class, and I sat by the back door. I was the first one out of the class. That's if I even turned up. "Sunday Catholics" we were called. Thinking we've fulfilled our obligation, we receive communion and out we go. Some sort of disciple huh. I'm proud to say, I'm no longer a "Sunday Catholic". I'm ashamed of that. I renounce that. It irks me to see people streaming into church just before communion, and exit right after that. Conscience anyone?  Now that I've aged a few years, I've made the decision - on my own - that I'd attend the CCA weekly.  I want to know my faith .  Currently, I am not too sure about the ministry that I should be serving in. Although I am in a Youth Group, and we're doing well, I'm still having thoughts about pulling out. I have no idea. I know I should not do without a ministry. Right now, I don't know.   Why do kids these days say "I don't know" so frequently? It's cos we really don't know.  Period. - Oprah Show.

      How short the day, How fast the time flew by.  Today we had a talk. It was not a very good talk. But I guess it helped a little.  I don't know. What do I know these days? What do I know about myself? What do I know about my own life?  Having no idea when you'll ever meet again. Is that the hardest part?  Growing up means knowing when to let go.

      Was reading chapter thirty-five and I was reminded of you. JealousKisser. It's been awhile since I last saw you. I can't help but smirk. I mean, you were so complacent. You were arrogant. You don't even know what hit you on your back. I know I shouldn't have smirked when I saw you after the race. You were drained. You had to be helped. You were receiving help. I know you were pretty embarrassed to let me see you in that state. Anyhow, I was reminded of that fateful Sunday. I flipped the newspapers, and as I always did, I checked out the Obituaries. I was shocked to see your Mom's photograph. I really was. I remember ringing up Char... And my dad drove us over. I don't know why I'm even writing this. I was just reminded of the scene. Of seeing your Mom's tiny body in the coffin. I'm sorry.  Oh well, spent the day out with Don who just returned from Brissie on Saturday. I missed him. It was nice seeing him again. I mean, we never really talked. We did not even go out before this. But it was nice. He'd be back for four weeks. But term starts this coming Monday for me. Anyhow, it was sure nice having him back here. Anyway, Don, I bet you'd read this. I just want to say thanks and I'm sorry for what I've said about Ms Idle. I mean, I'm sorry for now. Cos I do feel I might have judged her too fast. Misunderstood. I'd try to understand her side ok. But I can't promise I will be nice to her for long. It depends on how it works out alright... :)  Still down and out. You sounded worse today. Get well soon ok. I know you're mad at me. But you need to know the reasons behind what I did. We'll talk soon. Right now, just get well.  Clown contacted my sista today. He claims to have displayed the card. HOORAY! He says Hi. Oh well, have a good trip. We're missing you right here.  It's strange how people screw up their own lives. I feel I screwed mine pretty good. I'm happy where I am. But I think I might be happier if I did not stay. I would have grown faster. I would have learnt to swim. I wouldn't have drowned. Today I learnt a little. I had a little inspiration while watching the film. Today was a great day. I learnt. Everyday I learn a little. Life is good.

      and you know it. Nobody can give you that kind of guarantee.  You think you want someone who can transform your life with love. But you don't really want love. You couldn't handle real love. You want romance. You can't make the hearts and flowers stuff last for a lifetime. Sweet nothings is fine. Romance is fine. But I want someone who is going to rub my feet when I get old and tell me they love me even when I can't remember where I put my keys. That's what I want. I want someone I can grow old with.   Clown has left for Aussie. He left last night. And I miss him already. He left me a sweet message before he left. I'm awaiting his return in three months time. Three months. Three long months. Three dry months. Three lonely months. No Clown, no comedy. He promised we'd do more than just eat the next time we went out. Three long dry lonely months. I miss him already.

      That's what you are. Keeping to yourself, you refuse to admit you are hurt. You refuse to tell me how annoyed you are with me. You choose to keep it all within.  I cannot see through you. I feel I don't even know you. I'm tired of having to guess how you are feeling. I'm tired especially since I can only guess from your voice. I don't even see you anymore.  I cannot help you, I cannot help us, If you remain the way you are.  Maybe JumboLumbo was right. You are ready to be alone, I am not.  Maybe DixieChina was right. I am overly dependent on you.  I guess it's time for me to learn and realize when it is time to shut that door, and continue down the narrow passage way.  I needed to talk to you. That's why I called you. You hung up just like that. I know you are annoyed.  You said you'd call back later. I know that is a lie. No one calls back these days. It's all a lie.  I don't want to live this lie anymore. I don't want to fight for what's not mine anymore. I don't want to play this game anymore. I don't want to be there anymore.  You must be prepared for a day he will just be a friend and not a boyfriend! If you can come to terms with this, you can be enlightened like me!  I guess he's right. But I know, I will never be your friend again. Not after so long. Not after so much.  It would not happen the way we thought it would. We would never be able to keep that promise. We would never be the best of friends again.  I guess this happens when you know each other too well. You don't want to risk your friendship, just in case you don't work out. And when you decide to take that step, you can never return.  Yet I feel, I don't know you well enough.  I'm ready to shut the door and walk away. I'm ready to drown right now. I mean right now.  It might be a different story once I close this, But right now, I'm ready.

      0700h: Rise and Shine. Skin Crack. The air in here is very dry. Hungry and sleepy. My arms ache! Overate the night before... AH! Heading to Spaghettinna for breakfast. Italy! Italy! Italy! -gRin- Driver's coming at 0830h. Riding.  1957h: Back at the villa. Cleaned up and all ready for bed. Well, not exactly. I'm still in my bathrobe. Had a really really really really really really really really really funfilled day. Breakfast was alright. Plenty of coffee. Great service. Lots of 'Good Mornings'. Out to the stable, fitted our hats, and mounted our specially selected horses. Dad had a gorgeous large horse. Mom had a skinny one, Sista had one with wobbly legs... Due to... - your guess is as good as mine - I had a beautiful horny horse. Mounting and demounting the horse is much much much much easier than I thought. Rode for an hour with a young and kind trainer. We rode through the fields and on the beach and into the cool fresh ocean. My horse has a love-hate relationship with the water. She falls back behind my trainer's horse and suddenly picks up her pace. My trainer went, "You riding the horse?" HAHA! I wish! Anyhow, I got abrasions and bruise on the inner side of my left knee. The saddle. Had fun anyhow. Trotting was great. Riding on the beach - A dream come true. We later changed into our bikinis and headed to the beach. Our private beach. Just the four of us. Perfect. Sun-tanned and hit the waves. It was so so so so so much fun. The tide was fantastic. Water really clear. Forget Gold Coast. Come to Brunei! It's cheaper too... I think.   urlLink     Crabby!!!!!!!!! Fresh out of the hermit... Right!   Headed back to Spaghettinna for Buffet lunch. Dad and Myself. Had my coffee and milkshake. Bagus! Great pasta, great dessert. Tiramisu! Yum. The restaurant reminds me of Bella Vista on Superstar Virgo. In fact, better. Much better. I terms of food and service. How do you compare? A Seven-star hotel to a Cruise ship?  At about 1615h, the Driver - Special Duty Officer - was waiting for us at the lobby. We headed to Jerudong Park for the Polo match. The Prince played today. Jersey Number 2. He has a very beautiful horse. Lovely. Pretty.  urlLink     The Mexican Team: Antomio Palma (Handicap 1), Roberto Gonzales (Handicap 6), Robert Mehm (Handicap 2), Rogelio Igartua (Handicap 1).    urlLink     The Brunei team. The Prince in shades.    urlLink     The Prince on his Gorgeous horse    urlLink     Polo Match    urlLink     Mexican Team together with their competitor and the Umpire    urlLink     The Competitors together with the organisers as well as the Ambassador.   Polo is a nice game, but it's cruel for the horses. It's like playing hockey on horse-back. Instead of you legs getting wacked, it's the poor horses' legs that are getting it. I love horses. I love animals... No no.  Nonetheless, I'm going to the Polo match next week. Network time.

      Yanked out of bed and catupulp-ed to the washroom at 0555h by dad. Barely had enough sleep. Out of the house and onto the main road by 0640h. Met my neighbor on the way out. She's supposedly still in Secondary school, but instead of the good old St Nicholas pinafold, she donned the National Junior College uniform. Apparently, she's in the 'through train' program. No 'O' Levels for her. She's brilliant. Congratulations. Managed to flag a cab at 0700h and was at the airport within 15 minutes.  Encountered some nonsense during the check-in. We have to collect our tickets from the 'Excess Baggage' counter first, as DAD was paying by credit card. Had to go through the guards, explaining to each and everyone of them over and over again. MOM choose the seats - which turned out to be good - although DAD had already indicated the seats in wanted when he booked the tickets. Time flew by effortlessly. Shopping for goods in the transit, the Customer Service Officer at the Central South counter FAILED. She claims there are only TWO Deli carriers in transit. BULL! There are THREE. What's wrong with these people? When there are TWO, they claim there are THREE. When there are THREE, they claim there is only TWO?! Are they dense or what?  Bought a box of Lindt chocolate, one neat box of tea leaves, two gold bars and shots of latte. Packaging really counts. A box of GODIVA chocolate in gold, sets you back by $70, without tax.   urlLink     One of the well packaged chocolate bar purchased.   The tea leaves are in really nice packages. Eight different green tea types. Each individually packed in sacks and stored together in a neat wooden box. Sweet.   urlLink     Yet another well packaged product... the Pretty tea bags...   Managed to speak to my Honey Bun Sugar Cup. Twice. It was really great hearing his voice. I'm missing him already. Thankfully I've the recording of his voice with a message for me, his singing and his laughter on my mobile. Still, I miss him. It's different.  Did not use the airport facilities as time flew us by. The wait which used to plague me, was no more. Got to speak to my babe again, and I miss him so much.  It is only an hour and forty-minute flight to Brunei. The flight got delayed by thirty minutes. Credits to priority pass passengers. Unloading of the bags was done swiftly and I witnessed it from my seat. Estimated arrival time: 1135h. I'm sleepy.   urlLink     Paper work.    urlLink     Removal of the cargo box from the aircraft.    urlLink     SATS crew unloading the bags of the passengers who never made it.   It took more than thirty minutes to clear immigration. The officer was very inefficient. Other counters cleared two, she only managed one. Crap.  Arrived at the hotel via taxi. The Empire Hotel and Country Club. Very lovely. Princess Diaries come true.   urlLink      Current Location: Balcony of the villa. Climate: Windy. Music: The chirping of the birds. Time: 1545h. Lovely.   urlLink     One of the lovely view from my villa...    urlLink     Yet another view from my villa... Beautiful isn't it?   Just returned from the club house. Their supposed 'local fare'. Ordered a B$14 bowl of prawn noodles. Spicy with prawns that were not fresh. Anyhow, enjoying a cup of English Breakfast now. I'm really sleepy. Well, Yes, approximately three minutes ago, sista came and said "The curtains are automated". Way cool. We get the nice and - what the Dutch will call -   gezellig  room, without needing to get out of bed to draw the curtain. Rise and shine, you get the beams on your sleepy face without needing to crawl out. Life is good.  Will be heading out of the villa premises and going for a Polo Match at Jerudong Park. The Sultan's horses are playing. A chance of a lifetime, not to be missed. Mexican VS Brunei.  Heavy eye lids and bloated belly, we returned from the Royal Family's Playground at about 2100h. Did not manage to watch Polo today. The rain ruined it all. The Prince was late, and it was pouring really badly. According to our driver - Special Duty Officer, they call him - it's the first time Brunei rained so long and so hard. Their rain lasted only ten minutes, before this. Although we could not enjoy the highlight of the day, we sure had great dinner. Mexican. Love it. Awesome dessert. Cheese cake tastes really good with bitter coffee. Perfect.  The shower decided it wanted to follow the weather today, and started to flood the shower box before I could even shower. Thankfully for the well designed cubicle, the flood was contained within. Grabbing my robe, I crossed over to Dad's room. We had adjoining rooms. Parents the King, and Ours, the twin. Dad saves the night. YAY! Had no choice but to use the tub. The shower head was so heavy, as if it was made of pure gold! Tap shaped like an antique telephone. Anyhow, sis and I tied up our bikinis and dipped in the tub. Fun. Thinking about kid's names... She was. I was giving her ideas. We continued on to say the rosary. First decade, in the tub. She thanked GOD for her 'Boyfriend', I thanked GOD for my Husband!  Completed the rest of the rosary on our respective - extra large - beds. Upon the Prayer of Authority, I felt a chill, and so did she. Freaky. God is with us. Anyway, Charlie's Angel is currently playing on HBO. Boring.  Let's have a quick peek at the bathroom and the room, mnius the comfy beds...   urlLink     Is this the basin...? Or?    urlLink     Look at how self-sufficient this hotel is!!!  We do not need to pack a single thing of our own... Detergent, Bar soap, After Sun Lotion, Bath Gel, Shampoo, Conditioner, Comb, Emery Board, Shower cap, Toothbrushes.   urlLink     Snack Bar for the ever hungry!!!!   I miss my babe. I'm so happy to receive a message from him. I'm delighted. I can't express it. Wish you could be here. I'd retire now. Riding awaits me tomorrow. Polo in the late afternoon. See ya. Love.

      You can only drive her away.    How many loved your moments of glad grace, And loved your beauty with love false or true: But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you, And loved the sorrows of your changing face.    Managed to catch a few hours of disturbed nap. Awoke to the cling and the clangs, the inconsiderate alarm of that ass who stays in the room opposite mine. I wonder if he's deaf or something. The alarm can ring for minute after minute, and it just does not wake that moron from his slumber. What an inconsiderate jerk. Just had an argument with him about the dishes. He's the only one who eats here these days and he refuses to wash up. Even his own plate. He touches a girl. Uses violence. What an ugly man. Insult.   Will be heading to the airport in about five and a half hours. I packed my luggage in record speed. Dumped all my tanning essentials into a pouch, grab my skin-care products and pull out a few outfits. One for day wear, one riding wear and one dinner wear. Oh yes, my PJs. After so many months, I can finally be the passenger at the airport, not the worker there. I am going to make full use of the facilities and my time there.   I'm really looking forward to the trip. Time away from that Jerk. Time to tan. Hopefully, shop. Time to just lay back and relax. Time to write. One thing not so good about it is that I'll be away from my baby. I'm already missing him. We were on the phone a few minutes ago, and I'd be hearing his voice again in a couple of hours! Wish it was more convenient for him to send us to the airport... Thanks anyway dear. Sorry to trouble you. I love you.   * Note  for my  BABY : I'll be missing and thinking about you all the time. Do not worry yourself unnecessarily ok. Everything is a-okay. I'm happy. You should be too. Get well soon Babe.   The term has just started, and I am about to miss the yet another school day. How true, they pointed out, I seem to still be on holiday. Once again, pigging out instead of being in class.   I actually got out of the house early, and endured the entire journey on the jam-packed bus, standing and carry that helluva heavy bag. Traffic was slow, and I was about to be late for class. I hopped off the bus, and took one to downtown instead. Got myself coffee and took a walk. Met up with the FOUR Sabah 'Kids'. I gate crashed their lunch appointment. Dan Ryan's. It was nice, but disappointing. I have to say though, the ambiance is fantastic. One huge damper was the weather. It was all wet and gunk. We should all be sleeping at home.   Left them to get home and get my rest. My arms had abrasions from carrying the bag. My kind sister actually swooped with me for awhile. Thank YOU! Carry on your FFS ok. I'm going on a SSS instead! Guess guess guess!!!!    Everybody dies. Everybody leaves you. You turn your back for a moment and they are gone forever.

      I miss French. Yes, I actually miss a Language. My goodness. It's not that I'm piss drunk or dead tired or an emotional wreck. I'm serious. I've been missing the French Language for quite awhile now. I really never learn to appreciate the things I have till I loose it huh.  I should have watched all the French movies Jean-Marc rented for me. Regrets? Weren't regrets long behind me? No more regrets? Maybe not. Remember: The tide changes every second.  Yes, it's 0250h now, and I've to be up in four hours. It's not that bad, is it? I still can't sleep.  I miss French. How apt for my Lecturer - now what's that module again? - to show us the film  Yamakasi . It's a nice film. And I enjoyed every bit of the French dialogue. They sounded familiar. I guess they know me, but I don't know them. It's always the case.  Stupid.

      Before I even stabilize myself, I find myself falling again. Before I shut my eye, I find myself drowning again. I say a little prayer. I pray for you and I. I pray for strength. I pray for the spirit of deceit to be removed, I pray for my human frailties.  I can't sleep. I can't talk to anyone right now. Fast asleep I should be. But here I am, all alone. Don't get mad at me 'cause I really cannot sleep. Not now. I can't even talk. Each word is punctuated with a silent tear. I can't even cry myself to sleep anymore. It just isn't working. Maybe it's attributed to the fact that I drank too much coffee for my own good today. Maybe because I still can't come to terms with how the turn of events occurred so fast. Sixty minutes did not even manage to tick us by. Why is it always so short-lived?  I trust you. I really do. It just that when things start stringing together, I wonder what's happening.    "You must be prepared for the day when he'd just be a friend, and not a boyfriend anymore."  "He is prepared to be alone, but you are not."  -  Does he know something that I don't?   I had a good day just a few hours ago. When the good old grandfather's clock struck twelve, the happiness fled like Cinderella away from me.  Here I am alone and desolate in the study. I really should be sleeping now, but my mind just won't rest. Not yet. Not now.  It'd be a long day ahead. The semester has started and I'm faced with the nasty spinster - Personal Tutor of mine - to guide me on Feature Writing. I thought she was nice. I once thought, it'd be nice to have her as my Personal Tutor. Now that she is, I am so not longing for that. Be careful what you think of, it might all just come true. You do not even have to wish it. Three continuous semesters under her "wing" is enough to suffocate me, and choke me with her feathers. Sure, I enjoy writing. I just do not appreciate her classes. I'm so tempted to stay cooped up in my nest upstairs, and not face the world tomorrow. Just me, myself and my God. I want to go for a run. If the burglar alarm was not set, I'd be out there running my guts out. I want to be alone. I'm so confused all over again.  I want to have time to talk to you again. Have a good talk. Maybe we can do that when I get back. Your schedule is filled all the way today. I'm off first thing in the morning on Friday. When I return, I won't be able to meet you as much as I would like to. I've to attend evening mass. My apologies.  Maybe this getaway is a blessing in disguise. Time for me to relax and reflect. Think about my not-so-perfect life. About human things. Relationships, money, books, meanings.  I'm so gassed from all that crying. The silent tears frighten me.  I want to know what it was exactly. Why did I feel avoided? Why did I feel left out?  What will be will be.  I've procrastinated going to the Adoration Room. I'd make the trip tomorrow. If I attend class, I'd head straight down after that. Avoided going to the adoration room as I was terrified. I am still terrified. Been having  the prompt to visit the adoration room for a long time. Just never did. It's about time now. To be awakened. To have my eyes unfogged. To understand.  Perhaps I should return to my haven up there now. It feels cold and lonely up there, but I feel protected. Refuge.  I'm upset and my mind's not functioning properly. I can't find my diary. I can't find my passbook. I can't find myself. I can't find you. Yes you. Whoever you are. Where ever you may be.  I miss someone. I really do. Unfortunately it is almost impossible for me to converse with someone right now. The lives that we lead. They just make it impossible.   I'm all cried out . No more tears for now. No more stuffy nose.  Know what? I do not like my Law lecturer much. Not yet anyway.

      Over a pot of rice, we smile and we share. My heart is smiling, my sun is shining. I am truly thankful for today. Will not be seeing you for at least the next four days. Really hope to see you when I get back on Sunday.  Time flies when you're together. Time crawls when you're apart. I have yet to pack for my flight on Friday morning, 0900h via Terminal Two.  Talking about the airport, term has started, and I would be doing my duty on Monday. I really want to take Terminal One. I miss those gorgeous Irish with dark mahogany hair. Those glistening hazel eyes. I miss those blur looks on their faces. I miss the pleasant CSOs in Terminal One. I want to get back to O'Briens. I want everything Irish.  I'm nearly through with Tony Parsons. Will be hunting down "Man and Wife" next. I am intending to make a trip down to Bras Basah Complex next week. I am going to gather my art materials and dig into the books.  A minor achievement for the day... I made myself a neat cup of coffee. I love it bitter. Adore it. The Latte I had on campus today was alright, I think I make better coffee. Upon waltzing out of bathroom, I had a business idea. To open a cafe one day. I do not think we really have a market here though. I might venture across the seas. A book cafe. Throw in a beauty corner. All the things that I enjoy, all put into one. Sweet.  I'm looking forward to horse-riding, although my back has been giving me problems the past week. I want to go really fast. I miss having the wind in my hair.  I could do with a nicer tan. Badly.

      Listening to Sinatra makes me feel as though I am not the only person in the universe who ever woke up to find themselves in some place that they never imagined. Listening to Sinatra makes me feel that I am not so alone. Listening to Sinatra makes me feel more human. Frank recorded entire albums -  Where Are You?, No One Cares, Only the Lonely  - about missing some woman. The hippies think they invented concept albums in the sixties, but Frank Sinatra was doing it in the fifties. Sinatra will talk to you about it all night long, if you need him to. And I need him to. I need this music the way normal men need food and football. Sinatra seems to point a way forward, to encourage me to get on with my life. When Sinatra sings of love dissolving, there is always the consolation of love to come. Love is like a bus in these songs. There's always another one along in a minute. But I know that's not how it was in Sinatra's heart. I have read all the classic texts, and I know that Sinatra never got over Ava Gardner. She was the woman who owned his heart. She was the one whose photograph he tore up, threw away and then stuck back together with sellotape. If Sinatra never got over Ava, then how would I ever get over YOU?   A brand new semester, a fresh new start. No loud clashes, just tired faces showing up in the lecture theatre. Everyone's tired somehow or rather. My clock has yet to adjust to the sleep-at-night, work-in-the-day routine. I turn my life in total opposites whenever vacation starts. Just when I was beginning to enjoy everyday, the term weeks start creeping real fast.  Met up with the eat-every-hour gang after class today. We sat and ate till our butts got sore. I'm exhausted.  I'm addicted. I find myself yearning for one of my greatest allergy. The one thing that I stayed cleared of in my years of growing up. I'm exhausted.  My mind is messed up. I've issues that need satisfaction. I need answers. I look and I question. I search and I watch. Nothing. Not a clue. I hear things here and there. My ears are tickled. Again I ask. Again I watch. Nothing. You won't say a thing or show any emotion. Keeping it all inside. Misunderstood. Just tangles the threads more. Sometimes I feel I don't know you. Sometimes I feel you don't know me. Not anymore. You're slowly and surely slipping away. I won't hold you back. I won't stop you from going. I promised you that, I'll keep to it. I promised myself, I'd keep to it. I want you to be the first to share my joy and my sorrow. Yet you're not. Messed up that's what it is. Confused and trapped that's all there is. Why are we still hanging on? Is this what love is all about? Selfish. That's what you called me. Hurt you never thought I felt. Hurt you never thought cracked my heart. Yet I kept coming. I never gave up. You made me stay. You made me feel treasured. You promised me. You loved me.  My world's falling apart. Reading Sunday's paper made me cry. A silent cry. It just triggered. The flood gates opened. I'm trying to swim.  Focus. Focus on what lies ahead. I'm beginning to doubt.  The music is an endless source of comfort, though. Sinatra makes missing someone sound noble, heroic, universal. He makes suffering sound as though it has some kind of point to it. And in the real world, it doesn't. It just hurts like hell.

      May GOD bless you, hold and keep you; May GOD's mercy shine on you, Guide your work and guard your resting, Keep your love forever new.  May GOD satisfy your longing, be refreshment at your table, and provide your daily bread, guard your going and your coming, be solace in your silence; life within the lives you wed.  May God join your hopeful spirits, fill your hearts with truth and courage, trust to share both joy and tears, teach love to your children's children; may your household learn to witness living faith through all your years.    CONGRATULATIONS Kevin and Caroline!    Yet another emotional roller coaster, Yet another day I drowned. Yet another wedding.  Attended one in February, attended one in July. It is rumored that my cousin might be wedded this year end.  Weddings. It is a joyful event isn't it? For the couple, their family and friends. For the married couples, they silently reflect upon the vow they took. For the engaged couples, they silently watch and await their big day. For the love birds, they wonder when and how theirs will be. For the singletons, they silently pray for the one they love but won't love them back.  It is a joyful event.  It brought tears to my eyes. Not tears of joy. Just tears of indescribable emotion.  Couldn't sleep the night before. Couldn't get my mind of you. Maybe things are clearer this way. Maybe things get more complicated from here.  Each time I open my eyes, tears flow freely. I feel the droplets gently landing on my lap. I clasp my hands and said a silent prayer. I shut my eyes, and there your face will be.  Why?  Why are you chosen? Why didn't you tell me? Why did I have to hear it from someone else? Am I the last to hear of it?  Why?  Why are you doing this to me? Why did you give him to me only to take him away? Why did you let it last so long, only to break my heart?  The pain will be more bearable... If only for awhile.  I am unable to comprehend. WHY?! Why didn't you tell me?!  Why are you still leading me on? Why are you still making promises?  Why do you even say "I love you"?  Things are clearer now. I know why you were so cold. You should have told me. But you hid from me.  I trusted you. I kept my faith.

      This feeling inside, it's tearing me apart.  Quit that jabbing.  Quit that annoyance.  &nbsp;  Color. It's ugly. Change it.  Second time this week.  Wow.  &nbsp;  Amazing how I survived the ride home today.  I'm so drained. Mentally.  I can fall asleep anywhere at anytime.  It's amazing I did not drop dead somewhere along the walk in.  It's amazing I did not miss my stop today.  Been missing my stop lately. The frequency is scary.  But I guess, a little walk each day will make good eh?  &nbsp;  Wonder, I wonder to myself.  What it is you want right now.  What about us, baby.  What about you and me.  When will it be for us.  When will it be.  &nbsp;  You ask if I want to.  I said yes but you missed it.  Nothing is&nbsp;going to change it.  It's all too late right now.  &nbsp;  I cry I cry.  Cry my way home.  Cry my way home alone.  Where are you now,  Now that I need you.  Now that I want you.  Now that I care.  &nbsp;  I want to be happy.  Just like before.  I want to be lucky,  Just when I found you.  &nbsp;   Now it's all gone down down down.    Now it's all gone to the past.   &nbsp;  Headache. Heartache.  &nbsp;   Goodbye Love. &nbsp;

      I am beginning to really dislike those girls in green pleated skirts. That pathetic young and short girl with no patience and absolutely zero for conduct, stepped on my sandals today. That little creep. Impatience gets you no where. That pathetic un-heartfelt apology, save it for yourself. If every wrong doer hoped an apology will get them out of crap, they're so wrong. Especially not with the way you apologized. It could get your ass sued. Don't bother to apologize if you are not sincere about it. Guess all that studying to get into the top college has turned a dumbass out of you instead. Get a life.  I'm absolutely disgusted with the bus service around here. The standard has declined by 150%, and the prices have risen 100%. The waiting time is an average of 20 minutes. I can do loads of things with twenty minutes. But no, I've to spend that twenty minutes waiting for the bus. The only fruitful thing I can do is to read my novel. Fullstop. Furthermore, with all that extension of the bus routes, those staying in the high rise estates are driving me nuts. All their disgusting mannerism. What happened to the peace and quietness of my journey home?  Had a "presentation" today. I had absolutely no idea what sort of question I am suppose to post to those presenters. They are pretty comprehensive to me... Perhaps I was just too tired to notice.  I'm really full right now. The greens are filling. I love my vege and plain water.  I'm tired.

      Now that I have the time, I've uploaded more pictures of the hotel which I was staying in when I was in  Brunei ... Take a look and dream you are there. Yes, envy envy envy!    urlLink     A peek at The Empire Hotel    urlLink     A privilege peek at the hotel room.    urlLink     The majestic pillars of the hotel lobby    urlLink     A map of the entire luxurious hotel and country club.    Now, I am still toying with the idea of going to  Bangkok  at the end of the year for a little shopping... Dad and Mom will come down from Europe to join me there... Or rather, I'd be joining them there. I don't know yet. Anyway, got to remind Dad to keep his eyes peeled for gorgeous leather boots in Italy for me.

      Bench. Seat. Stool. Whatever you call it. Find them in the parks, Find them at the bus stops. Find them where the lazy bones are. Hints. Hints. Hints were dropped. All that leaning and all that motion. They were not for fun. Benches. Afraid of falling. You'd never lose your balance. Matter. It doesn't matter. No. Of course it doesn't. It's been so long, it's all accustomed. This happens all the time with humans doesn't it? We just get used to things instead of changing them for the better. We just get used to it.  Strange how MAN is. She does something, you seem to stop her. She thinks she has irritated you, she moves away. She moves away, you pull her back. Back to do what she thought annoyed you. Man. Mentally Able Not.  Feeling a little strange. I can be so high and happy, and the next, all so down and low. It's the funny mood swings. Haven't had them in a long time. Sure hope they aren't back for good. Mood swings were out of my life for months. I shall not let them take control of me.  Watched 'Super Size Me' this late afternoon. It wasn't a movie. Just a film. Somewhat like a documentary. It has sure steered me off Fast Food. At least for a while. I'd seek solace in my greens.  I would say I had a pretty good day. Everything started well. I got myself out of bed at 0630h and was out of the house by 1910h. Jumped into Dad's car for a ride. Wonder why my parents are leaving the house so late these days... Anyway, Dad dropped me off near my brother's college, and I caught my bus from there. Coincidentally, my darling was on the same bus. I was ecstatic. The joy of seeing someone you miss even when you've just seen him. I love him.  Nothing new in school. Boring Law tutorial. Thankfully I read enough law books to have an idea of how things work. Only thing the books I read are of American Law. It's different here. We do not have a jury system. The Digital Media lab is full of crap. What a "Pride and Joy" of the campus. The air conditioner was down. The room was so stuffy, I felt so sick. Thankfully our kind lecturer released us from our agony at 1415h. I was out in a minute. Hmmm, realize that I am always the first one out of that door...  Feeling pretty uncomfortable right now. I do not know what's happening to me. Been feeling this tingle in my arms for a couple of days now. My fingers get frozen so easily. I was not like this in the past. Feeling cold easily and getting bruises so often. It's just not me. Bruised both my hip bones and they are killing me with every movement I make. My jeans just cut right into them. My bag just hits my bone with each step I take. Annoyingly I bruised my leg today. Chairs.  My eyes been twitching. I think I better sleep.  Sorry dear if I looked distracted and upset about something. It's something I myself cannot explain it to myself. It's incomprehensible.   You will go, you will meet.

      The one who cares the least has the greatest control.  I'm glad I made the decision not to go down to shop for my art materials today. The weather loves to go haywire around here. It was all bright and shiny when I was walking in. Once I put my bag down on the dining table, the clouds start darkening.  Home alone and loving it. Although I do wish YOU could be here. Anyhow, I enjoyed lunching with you. I hope we can do this more often.  School was all the same. One lecture and that was it. Thankfully the Flag Day was cancelled. I wasn't intending to go in the first place.  Life is boring. I'm exhausted. I'm happy yet I'm sad. One can never be satisfied I conclude.  I stink.

      I feel like I'm still on holiday.  I intend to really work hard this Semester, but it's not working out the way I planned. Two days away from school in the first week. WOW. What is installed the following months?  Anyhow, thinking my hope of seeing my dearly missed darling would be dashed thanks to CYA duty, I contemplated not going... Coincidentally, Babe and I ended up at the same FC for lunch. I was delighted. We lunched together, but time flew us by. It always happens. Sadly.  GOD has HIS ways of giving us something in return for something He takes away huh... Went for duty at Terminal TWO. Remember I used to complain about having no cute guys in Terminal TWO? Well well, I met one really gorgeous guy today. French man. Wait... Not exactly French. He just holds a French passport, but he lives in Germany. He's half German. Johan-something... I was squinting to catch his name on his boarding pass.  Was just standing around, recovering from all the disturbance of the other CYA- Jerry, when this well-built Caucasian, with gorgeous blue eyes came up to me and said, " Speak English?" He wanted to leave his bag in left baggage for three hours, to see the city before heading back to catch his next flight which is at midnight. I take him to the Foreign Exchange, where he changed 50 Euros for hundred and one dollars and cents ninety. He requested for the lady to change the notes to even smaller notes and coins. Charming. We then went to the left baggage, where he had to produce his passport - this is how I know he's French - and pay up. He took everything out.. Boarding pass and all... That's where I catch his name. Anyway, he told me he's half French and half German, and he can write and read French, but can't speak. - Can't blame ME now! - He lives in Germany, and he finds German tough. Strange man. Funny thing is, he speaks such fluent English, no accent and all, till I asked if he was French, and the accent revealed itself. Amazing. Anyhow, he was going to the Esplanade and Fullerton... Have fun dude.  It was a busy busy night at the airport. Loads of passengers coming for help. Walked a few clicks that night. Had these three CYAs disturbing me. Jerry and the other two seniors. Jerry kept coming to my counter to look for Joyce the CSO. When I bum into him escorting passengers, he said I look like I'm shopping in town. Then the senior.. I don't know his name... JORDAN? Kept coming with his camera. Sorry dude. I never allow myself to be caught on cameras like yours! I'm too fast for you.

      Was on the phone with my darling the minute I could. He picked up almost immediately. I'm so so happy. Although the journey back was not so pleasant, hearing his voice made it all fade away. I'm happy to be home.  The aircraft was so freaking smelly. The service was crappy. Silkair. All these coach sharing crap is driving me nuts.  Anyway, I met up with my Darling at about 1740h. He came over to pick me up for mass at St Vincent de Paul. It was so great seeing him again. I miss him so very much! Spent a quiet evening with him after that. I feel so much better after talking to him, and after he clarified things with me. I'm really on top of the world. I know you'd be reading this, YES! I'm really happy we had the time and privacy to talk things out. We're going to make this work right?!  After so many many months, I finally got to try the Hokkien Mee my Babe has been promoting. We drove all the way back down to his place, ordered the mee, and came all the way back to my place. YUMMY!!!  Anyhow, I'm going to rest now. Back to school tomorrow. Right....................  I love you babe!

      The airport here is atracious. The smell of the toilet can be whiffed from the Duty Free Shop. The service here is appalling. Smelly toilets aside, the duty free shops carry such limited goods.  Anyhow, checked out of the hotel real early today. Shared a buggy with the Mexican Player, Antonio Palma to the lobby. We were to attend mass with Dad's friend. 0730h mass. We got to the Church of the Lady of the Assumption at 0700h.  Mass was pretty similar to what we have back home, only thing they stood during the offering, which we did long time ago. They have only one Catholic Church in Brunei, and one Angelican church opposite the Catholic Church. It looked all shaggy on the outside, but is relatively modern on the inside. Just small. The Priest was mumbling to himself. Everything was monotone. So was the Choir. Dull and draggy. I fell asleep.   urlLink     The Church in Brunei

      This is great. Just so so great. I hate it. I hate the greatness of it all.   I am going for the dinner after all. After all that screaming and shouting. I have not shouted at this speed and volume for a long time. I have not fumed like I did in a long long time. Too long, I do not remember when I last yelled like that. No, it did not feel good. Not good at all.   Some sort of RESPECT huh... You go to the dinner because you are forced to go. What respect? I am not going out of respect. This is crap. I am now a hypocrite just like the others. Thanks. I so do not like to be caught in a situation like that. It always happens. Every one acts all so cordial, but beneath that, they are snickering at you. All that fakes. Yeah, every single one. All of them putting on a front. It's crap. The food better be good. It better make my sacrifice of chili crab worth it. *beep*   I totally disrespect people like that. That is why I refuse to go. That is why I refuse to conform. Something wrong with me huh. Individual. Look at yourself first. I rather be chained up at home than attend some stupid dinner. It is not even a dinner. Anyhow, MOM promised two hours, and no more. I can do whatever I want when I am there. I do not care.   I am annoyed. Do not disturb.   Babe's coming in awhile. I have to try to get some research for Monday's presentation done soon.   I am so annoyed. *beep*

        I am dying inside to hold you.      You are still the one.      Everyone thought we would not last.      After all these time, you are still the one I want.      &nbsp;  It was a good day. School was fine, although I kind of zonged off for awhile there. It was alright. The last day of the academic week, the longest one yet. 0900h to 1700h. No joke. Every other day has been just two modules a day, one module a day kind of arrangement. Friday, it's - Lecture, tutorial, tutorial, lecture, lecture. It's tiring tiring tiring. Thankfully we do not have long breaks in between, or it would have been worse for me. I made it through anyway. For the very first time this semester. YAY!   Met Nic on my way home today. He was possibly in the same bus as me throughout, but I did not notice him till we got to the bus stop to hop onto the next service. Nic, have not seen him for quite some time now. Always running in to him at the bus stop outside my house, although he should be at the stop before. Anyhow, he is still as good looking, really cool hair he has now. For the first time today, I noticed he has a very nice profile. Unfortunately, it is either I have grown taller, or he has grown shorter... What an oxymoron. I am trying to be positive here! Alright, he has shrunk. Still as good looking no doubt. It's true huh... How GOD compensates you with something... Short but good looking. Hmmm, I bet I grew taller. I mean, I turned around, and BAM! He was right behind me. Don't think he realized it was me before that... And for a moment, our eyes met. Although he is really shorter. I believe our eyes were not on the same level.   Alright, that SIS of mine just pissed the crap out of me. No, I am not going to let her ruin this fantastically long day of mine. Grandpa's birthday dinner tomorrow. I was not told about it. If I had not mentioned anything to HER, nothing would have been said to me. I so do not intend to go. I mean, I have an appointment tomorrow. Double date!!! How fun huh! Planned by the BOYS. I mean, I find it so dumb to go there and wish the poor old man happy birthday and then stuff our faces with food, with no conversation what so ever. I will definitely be bored to tears. Especially with annoying kids running around. I do not want to cause disharmony or anything like that, but I find it all so fake. What HAPPY BIRTHDAY? When none of them is happy? How hypocritical can one get? Amongst family? Sorry... Money walks the talk. Oh yes, she actually contacted my baby to tell him that "Family first". What a load of crap. I confirmed my other appointments already. It is just too bad. Come on! I would normally attend these "Family gatherings", unless I am at camp or something. HELLO! I have an appointment already. It does not matter whom the company is. It is who I confirm attendance with first. Honestly, I had absolutely no idea that it was going to be Grandpa's birthday dinner tomorrow! Like, WHATEVER. Enough said.   Went off for LISS preparation this evening. It was good. Affirmation and all, although it was interrupted due to time constraint. We ended up saying our closing prayer by the road side. Not complaining.    I am hungry .

      Just running. Running round the world. Chasing my own life ahead.  Charging. Just charging straight ahead. No one is going to stop me. No one can.  Who cares about you, my friend? You are not even my friend. You are a mere acquaintance. Do not fool yourself. No upper hand do you have. Cos I do not give&nbsp;a thing for your looks. Or personality, if any to start with. Your command of the English Language is appalling.   Lecture. I have no idea what it is all about. I mean, nothing at all for me to jot down... Insecurities.   LISS preparation this evening. I have nothing to do with the LISS camp, but I am still going for the session. The feeling is so good. The Spirit truly is among us. Yes, right here, right now.    Take a look at us now.

       Even the moon refuses to shine . The darkness that looms ahead. Afraid I am not. Loneliness is my companion.   As I took a walk -&nbsp;not a leisure one -&nbsp;I feel myself begin to sink. I managed to stay afloat throughout, but once I left that faithful ground the weight that I carry gave in to gravity. Drowning once again, I reach to feel your hand. It&nbsp;was not there. You were not there.   The sadness in your eyes as I looked upon your face just tears my heart in to a million pieces. It was not my intention to hurt you or pull you in to drowning waters with me. It never is, and more not so now.   The anger that I felt, the sadness within me, all that emotions welled up inside. Away I went. You were not there when I returned. I know you have your reasons and replies for me. I know them all. "I was coming back... You did not tell me anyway." "I had things to do."  I know them all by heart.     I just keep drowning .   Moon, do you feel the way I do?  Where is your sun beam now?  Now that I need you?   Are you covering your face in shame?  Are the dark clouds that shield your beautiful face the dark tears of your heart?   This is all my own *beep* fault. It all is. Silly.   Forget about the incident before. Why let it cause a rift?  So what if it was mentioned to you only now and not before?  You are the silly one to tell every *beep* *beep* thing even when you are still considering it.  You're nothing special. Not when there are buddies around. Not on that faithful ground. You are nothing. Nothing at all. Try as you might, till the angels of death are by your side. Nothing. Your cries are but an insignificant wink. Apologized and forgotten. Nothing.  It does not last .   Silly.  Silly of you  to even touch on that faithful ground. You jolly well know. Silly.   Alone. Don't you enjoy being alone? Don't you enjoy the silence of the night alone?  As far as I can recall, YES you do. You love being alone. Why should you be amazed now? You're nothing special. Greater tasks and people awaits him. Who are you to ask for anything? Anything at all. Alone you shall be. Alone you shall walk. Loneliness is your best friend. It always has been. Don't deny her now.  Don't lie about your best friend .   I wish, I just wish... I did not have to take that walk alone. It felt like I walked away from you. It is not right. I did not. You choose to walk away. I am so tired. I am so tired of this race. This mountain. I wish I could just drop dead. I really wished it as I was walking. I want to.

      School. Tutor away on Medical Leave. No prior notice. Complete waste of my time. To think I took extra effort to make sure I got to school on time. But NO! I'm freaking on time today. 0845h to be exact. No class. To hell with it. I will probably go down town to do my necessary stuff later on. Will decide whether to stay for the next tutorial later on. I am currently not feeling too well. Had thoughts of staying home. Praise and Worship tonight. It seems Blimp and Prof Lee have the scores for the Worship tonight while I do not. Crap.   I have a strong feeling that this funny feeling inside is due to the overload of carbs the day before. I have been off carbs load for so long, and whamp! I load it all in one day. Enough to cover what-nots that I have missed out so far. Enough to last me a lifetime.   I want to get married.

       For the temple bells are calling, and it is there that I would be - By the old Moulmein Pagoda, looking lazy at the sea.     &nbsp;  NO MORE PIZZA HUT. As much as I simply adore putting chucks of cheese in to my mouth, I have consumed more than enough stuffed crust pizzas to last a few years now. The standard of pizza served is appalling. What is happening to this supposedly budding food industry of Singapore? Are we not the everything-under-one-roof hub? Not only has the food standard in Pizza Hut dipped, the service is also going down the drain. Inefficiency is a major issue here. Taking as long as twenty minutes to serve finger food is atrocious. Not as if they are placing extra effort into preparing my food! It takes them just as long to get me a glass of warm water.  &nbsp;  Ponderosa is another disappointment. What happened to all my delicious childhood memories? All that salivary food and excellent service? What used to be a relatively reputable restaurant is now down to shackles. I mean it. I recall, we use to have to queue for easily over an hour to get a seat in the restaurant. Followed by huge orders of steak and buffet. Somewhat like the current Sizzlers. Unfortunately, Ponderosa is right now just catered for the junkies. Even the steaks are on the buffet belt. And badly done at that.  &nbsp;  Delifrance. It used to be such a treat to be able to savor the seafood croissant from Delifrance. Now it's no difference from any other deli. Lest my O'briens. The standard has dropped tremendously. It's really very disappointing.  &nbsp;   I miss O'briens . Got to find out where the nearest outlet is right now. I miss O'briens.  &nbsp;  Finally got my art stuff. But stupid me forgot to drop in the coupon today. I took it out of my wallet together with the voucher and my VIP card, but I simply kept the coupon back instead of dropping it into the box. How silly. Now I'd have to make another trip back there before Sunday. I might go down on Friday.  &nbsp;  This coming Sunday would be the Food and Funfair held in my church premises. I am thinking of getting my cousin to go down with me. To mix with fellow YOUTHS. It'd all depend.  &nbsp;  Oh well, it was nice to finally have a long chat with  DAD .&nbsp; Various topics came up and yes, it was a pleasant evening. Today is a good day once again. Talked about studies, about school, about people. Know what? I want to have a lifestyle like my aunt's. She jets off to Hongkong like we take a public bus. She flies there just to have dinner. Can you imagine that? Of course she has the spending power with a successful law firm and big shot husband. I asked DAD if she needs a shopping and dining partner... I want to be successful like her. Hmmm... Went on to talk about my cousin and religion. I guess DAD's right about helping her. Not doing things just for another person, but more like doing&nbsp;GOD's work. Saving another soul. We can invite and encourage, if it is not reciprocated, at least we tried. I realized I have not spoken to DAD for quite awhile now. Have yet to have a proper meal with him thus far. Tonight was a good chance to. We chatted about Law and legal matters, about sexual harassment from verbal to physical touching, verbal and physical assault. It's interesting. Law. Lawyers.  &nbsp;  Praise and worship tomorrow.  &nbsp;   Love never fails.   &nbsp;  *Note: Thank you Darling for today. The very filling meal, the shopping and carrying of my stuff... Really very sweet of you. Thank You!

      I think that you can use up your LOVE. I think you can blow it all on one person, you can LOVE so much, so deeply, that there is nothing left for anyone else. You could give it all the time in the world, and  I would never find someone to fill the gap .  &nbsp;  Yes, I would never find someone who could fill the gap. I love you.  &nbsp;  It's a beautiful day!

      What a long yet beautiful day it has been.  &nbsp;  Did not manage an entry the day before. Got in pretty late. Spent eight solid hours in church for three different group meets. Charismatic practice followed immediately by Zion's Joy. An hour's break for dinner, and back to the Upper Room for the LISS preparation session, right up to 2230h. Phew.  &nbsp;  It was a great day.  &nbsp;  After the session ended, instead of heading straight home, I asked if we could go somewhere quiet. I wanted to go to the beach. The weather was so good for that. Furthermore, I felt really heavy. I wanted to get away. My babe then drove us to our usual spot. I do not have any idea what got into me. Why I have been having these strange feelings. It's really weird, this feeling inside me. Tears overcame me during the LISS Praise and Worship session. Dan and myself were the only two to cry I think. I could not open my eyes. All I felt was tears hitting me hard. Thankfully Babe was sitting right beside me... Giving me comfort and offering me his trusty hankie. Thank you darling! Strangely, I did not experience the tiredness which I would feel under normal circumstances. The song " COMPLETE ".  Through the storm I will hold on Lord... And I'd see beyond my Calvary one day, and I will be complete in you . So beautiful, so powerful.  &nbsp;  I think I freaked him out a bit when I cried... Didn't I? I'm sorry.  The reason for that uncontrollable outburst of emotions is due to the incident which occurred on Friday evening in this place I call HOME. Followed closely by that scary scary dream. The dream was so real. It freaked me out completely. I was really going to snatch up my phone to give Babe a call. Yes, in the middle of the night. I was so freaked, I could not sleep. This isn't the first time such a dream occurred. This isn't the first time. Although it's a totally different person this time, the same thing happened. The same thing happened, twice. Twice in the one dream. Freak!  &nbsp;  I'm glad I went for the evening session, although Babe did say he'd send me home if I did not want to stay for it. I'm glad I did.  &nbsp;  Saturday went really well. Only to be ruined by the final minutes. It always happens. It was harsh. There were tears in my eyes, I was choking as I spoke. Those went unnoticed. The words came fast and harsh. All I could say was, "goodbye".  &nbsp;  Woke up bright and early today. Christ the King. Zion's Joy will be helping out with their LISS camp this August. It was a good morning I would say. Although I had to get up pretty early. It was a good day. It truly was. I had a good time. Although somethings tend to screw up just to ruin what would have been a perfect day. Sadly. I am just too sensitive.  &nbsp;  Town followed closely. The Sushi was total crap. I am feeling the guilt. I so regret going there. Should have just came home and waited for dinner. Afterall, we had plenty of samplings going on. All were pretty good except for the lychee tea and the red wine. It was so dry and heavy. Not good.  &nbsp;  I miss you babe. As much as I would like to see you and be with you right this moment, I understand that it is not possible. I know that emergencies like these happen. I am not upset by it or anything like that. Do not worry alright... Just lift it up to  HIM . Everything will be alright. Everything happens for a reason, I believe.  &nbsp;   I miss you .  &nbsp;   Why is it that everytime you ask,    it's negative?    Why is it that everytime you speak,    it's annoyance?   &nbsp;  Perhaps I could get used to that too...

      WOOHOO!!! Got back not too long again, stomach filled with CRABS! Nice. The weather was good, the food was good. Been eating too much for my own good. My throat is pretty bad. It's so heaty. Life is good. It really is.   Zonged my way through school today, awoke to a deadly headache. No, not heartache. Headache. The spinning was driving me nuts. The crowd on the way to school was merciless. Some Auntie who was standing behind me - this means she's facing the other side - tried to pretend to be watching TVmobile, when she noticed the guy in front of me was alighting. She was trying to get the seat. I would have graciously offered her the seat... IF she was more polite about it. Each morning I see her, she's always shuffling to get a seat, with no concern what-so-ever for the others around her. Just her luck that she was going against me today. No push over am I. That means, no seat for her. Not today.   Oh well, time floated by. I survived the day with no thoughts to miss any lesson. GREAT. I have to keep this up. Cutting classes is not my style anymore. Yeah, not my style.   The chili crabs were SHIOK! It tasted real good with rice. I think the price we paid was quite reasonable... 50-five bucks for seven crabs, a plate of vegetable, black pepper beef and three bowls of rice. It's quite a steal! We had fun. Time again zoomed us by. We traveled all the way from YCK to JE to drop  JL  and  his lady  home... AND, I thought the place started to look familiar. Initial thought was, "WOW... I've never been to this part of the country before..." Then it dawned on me... "AH!  Nina  stays here!" It's a small world after all... It's a small world after all!   Hmmmm, the above so did not sound like me. I do not type like this. Strange. Right. I've been acting strange the whole evening. Maybe it's a carbo high... I do not know. Stay off carbo for too long and it's piling back up.   Legal System and Contracts CA up tomorrow. I sure hope I remember my facts and understand her questions... That strange Lecturer.   I'm so high. High and lifted up.   It's raining MAN!   DARN! Have not seen the Levis guy for two days in a row. How disappointing.

      Kiss the rain, and I'll be on the other side.  So he says.  Together we'll watch the stars above, we'll bask in the moonlight shine.  I see your face in the moon above, I dream of you in my arms.  I want to cuddle. Cuddle till we both drift away.  Never again will you walk alone, I'll always be right here.   An unfulfilled promise.   The rain camouflaged my tears.  It hurts, but I won't say.  I'll never let you see the tears on my face, the wound in my heart.  I'll never let you see the hole you left behind.  I'll never let you know.   You were so happy the day before.  You were so grateful for all you had.  Now you want to end it all.   Is it worth anything at all?   All your life you've shed these tears.   Don't give up on what you have been fighting for.

      Levis and Coca Cola, complements in consumption?   Saw that cute Malay guy early this morning. He is dressed head to toe in Levis. The jacket sure looks good on him... As Nina pointed out, the same jacket on the other guy sure did no justice. It only looks good on this particular one. Really. We even made eye contact today. He was coming round the bend at the drink stall, and I was on the other side of the bend. He's tall. Heard from Nina he actually speaks Mandarin. WOW. I'm floored! Hey, I have never said a Malay guy was good looking before. No offence, but I have never really come across any cute Malay guys. Not till this one came along. Levis and coke. That is him. Oh yes, sandwiches and plastic glasses.   What a beautiful day...    You give some, you take some, you get your heart broken a little, but that's the story of, that's the story of, that's the story of LOVE.

      You can make a difference. You don't believe it, do you? You think the world is out of your control. You can't imagine the changes you can make it some one's life. It's not too late. You can still be one of the good guys.   Finally got my assignment underway. CAs up this Saturday. Chili crab this Friday. WOW. Cannot wait. Mass Media Research is still bogging me down. Stupid survey questions. Darn *beep* tough. We'll see how it goes. Hardly there.    Wife: 'I bought this couch 'cos we needed a place to sit.'    Husband: 'And I bought this ticket 'cos I wanted to go to the game, and I need a seat.'     Now, who is the more practical one?!

      Life is an opportunity, benefit from it.  Life is beauty, admire it.  Life is bliss, taste it.   Life is a dream, realize it .  Life is a challenge, meet it.  Life is a duty, complete it.  Life is a game, play it.  Life is costly, care for it.  Life is wealth, keep it.   Life is love, enjoy it .  Life is mystery, know it.  Life is a promise, fulfill it.  Life is sorrow, overcome it.  Life is a song, sing it.  Life is a struggle, accept it.  Life is tragedy, confront it.  Life is an adventure, dare it.  Life is too precious, do not destroy it.   Life is life, fight for it .   Met Nic on my way back again. It was better today. It was not as awkward. Although it still was a little. We made our way home together. It was weird. The strange yet familiar feeling. He is still good looking. Nice profile.   Gathered a number of articles at last. Will be penning and composing my questionnaire in a couple of hours. Loads of work to do. All that crazy rush and mug. I will cope. I will survive. I have to... In this competitive world. Fight or die.

      Work overload.   Weeks passed us by. Projects are soon  due . Where assignments are concerned, we are already  falling behind . CAs are soon arriving, in fact there is one just  this Saturday .  Legal System and Contracts . What do I know about this module? Eh... Nothing much really. I mean, I go through the notes and I seem to do fine. During tutorials, it is a different story. Wait till I get the hang of this, I'd score. I mean it. Memorizing facts, no problem for me. History was my forte after all. Missing the first two lectures - which the CA will be based mainly on - is a pretty frightening thought. I'd manage. I sure will. I am going to sit down and start dirtying my books and absorbing all that information I need to do well in this semester. I will. I have to. I am already four weeks into school. Half the term is gone. Better get the engine cranked.    Mass Media Research  is the project on my mind right now. I am unable to find any relevant articles to&nbsp;act as an inspiration&nbsp;to my questionnaire. This sucks. I have to have the questions by  9am tomorrow morning . I am getting to work already.   Giving up my time at the airport. Not like you have to drag me out of it. I know my priority. Studies come first. As much as Ms Vicky stressed to place airport duty as  THE NUMBER ONE , results count too. Especially so for me. A very very very poor student. I am not going to carry on drifting. I have to start somewhere. Ms Vicky sure looks at our grades too. Favoring those who do darn well. Even the deaf knows that for a fact. Studies is my number one priority. Not to mention the poor pay we are getting from the airport. Thankfully I am not hard up for the cash. It's ten bucks for four hours. Misery. My grades will cost more.   Now, where am I suppose to find sources with regards to  Youth and their mobile phone lifestyle ? Yes, I know mobile phones are the extension of their arms... Still, it does not solve my problem of phrasing good survey questions. HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Could it be you?  You who make my heart skip a beat,  You who keep me up all night?  Could it be you at work again?   Another long sleepless night.  Another long day ahead.   Up at eight, out by half past eight.   Disappointing.  The food was not at all nice, the music was way too loud. I could not hear myself!   Went down to Christ the King after that. Time seems to fly today. I felt myself falling asleep. It was a good session none the less.    Chili crab  this Friday. Session on Saturday evening. I would prefer sessions be on Friday evening after this week... Please!   Little things around us sure make life more interesting. This, I finally learnt on Friday as I made my way home.  Life is beautiful .   The dinner. It was alright. The food was definitely not there. But hey, it was not as bad as I thought it would be, although there were really awkward times. Like MOM getting all edgy, and speaking too much. Way too much.   On to prepare tutorial presentation, followed by a nap if I can, and out I go again!     Life is beautiful  , indeed.

      F*cking stupid. So f*cking stupid. Why in the world did you have to pick up that f*cking phone to make that f*cking call? What difference did it make? You jolly well know he'd be busy. Yet you went ahead and sent yourself out there to get screwed. F*ck. Why in this f*cking world did you do that? He is so f*cking busy, why would he have called you? Who are you? You are just but a nobody. A nobody who stands between him and his true love. You are the F*cking b*tch who tempts and ruins him. You are so f*cking stupid.  F*cking insensitive wh*re . F*ck you. Although all you wanted was to hear his voice once more. Just once before he is taken entirely from you. All you wanted was to hear him. All you wanted. Right.  You selfish wh*re . All for your selfish reasons. You f*cking stupid selfish b*tch. Yeah, sure you were not looking for the explanation. F*ck. So what if he promised an explanation today? So what if he f*ckingly went off somewhere when he said he was going home? So what if he f*ckingly went to spend f*cking time with the same pals he'd be seeing all weekend? So what if he f*ckingly chose to do so? So what if  he f*ckingly chose them over you ? I thought you came to that conclusion sometime back? Don't you see it? You are just a big fat f*ck.  You don't mean no thing  to him. You WH*RE! His actions and words express two extreme ends. You naive f*ck. Why go on cheating yourself? Quit lying to your f*cking self that he loves you all so much. That you are  the apple of his eyes . You are but a big f*ck. Okay? Nothing more than a f*ck. What a joke you are. You should have hung up. Didn't you hear the f*cking annoyance in his voice? How annoying and f*cking irritating you are. Don't you understand? Aren't you suppose to be the understanding supportive one? F*cking stupid. It is so f*cking f*cking f*cking stupid. Just wish peace could be attained before he goes away. Unfortunately, NO! He's just too busy. Too f*cking busy.  Too f*cking busy for you . You are just for show. Just company when he's lonely. Fullstop. FUCK.  Evolution on AXN. I remember who I watched it with. Seems like I was such a naive school girl back then... I thought I've matured. Who am I kidding?  "I want an ice-cream... I like ice-cream." "What flavor?" "It doesn't matter. It's for my  ass ."

      *Beep*. Why do things never seem to go right these days? Why does everything have to go left? Why does everyone favor left? Why do people allow it to go left and not right?  Is left more unique? Isn't it getting a little too outrageous? Isn't it becoming too common? Do we always have to conform? Is there no other way around?  Leftist.  *Beep* It takes me one hour and 20 minutes to commute from campus to home. In order to make your life easier, I chose the longer route. I say I want to avoid the crowd. The heartlanders were just my excuse. Things that are done out of love, silence is especially golden. It is a rule. My rule.  Exhausted from the lack of sleep and the pile of work. Stressed out from your exit, weighed down by the marks. Hoping to get that ride. Take that freaking bus! I missed it. I am so dead tired. Evening activities are messing me up. *Beep* I requested for that ride. Rejection. After all these months, haven't I learnt not to ask? Stupid. My own *Beep* stupidity. *Beep* it. Time. It is a major major factor.  Reconciliation. *Beep*  Vulgarities have been bombarding my mind. *Beep*  I am thankful for the weekend. I want my rest. Unfortunately I will not be getting any. I won't even see you. Won't even hear you. But I am thankful for it. Thankful for them all.   I need to get my project done. Clean up the mess, which Miss Greenie Wonderland made poop out of.   Prepare for my presentation on Tuesday.  Revise from my management CA.   Boy am I thankful for the weekend. I am so grateful we are not allowing Wonderland to do the presentation. Having given her step by step instructions, she still screws up. Imagine a presentation, where all we have is a set of powerpoint slides. All in point form. She'd probably read off the slide and blank out. If we asked her to do the powerpoint, we would probably have to give her the stuff, and she'd just type out the entire chunk. That is just how dense she is. Yeah. Thick. That's what she is. I do not mean to be rude, but it is a fact. I cannot tolerate any longer. *Beep*  While you are trying to distress and get your long awaited sleep, you receive a message that says:  Encountered some problem with excel. Looks like I'd need your help during break tomorrow.  *Beep*  See what I mean? She messes up, and I have to clean it up. That 'brilliant' girl in her wonderland. Really wonder just what is going on in her wonderland. In that numb skull. She has tried my patience enough. I was clearly controlling my anger and exasperation. She *beep* messaged the other line too. *Beep* The last time I asked if it was her who messaged the other line. I even quoted the specific message, she was like, "No, not me." *Beep* I checked. It was indeed her. Was she trying to avoid looking stupid? Come on. Pissed the *beep* out of me. Told her nicely not to contact me on the other line, still she pissed me off.  Told myself to be nice to her this term. I tried. From the start of this project, I was very extremely patient with her. But I have had enough. She is so going to screw up my project. This project is going to contribute a huge percentage to two of my very important modules. I am so not going to let her screw it up. Unfair as it might seem. She'd get the grade with zero effort. No initiative. Unfair towards the other members of the group. But we cannot tolerate it anymore. We have to get our things done and we are going to go on with it on our own. Not like she contributed anything. Makes no difference to the whole project. *Beep* Life is so going the left way. *Beep*   I am so dog-tired right now.  She wonders where you are and what you are doing. You promised you would call, but you did not. You told her you'd be back, but where are you? Wishing you could be here now that she's so worn out. Just to hear your voice and feel your warm embrace. Where are you now?  She wishes she could see you tomorrow. She knows it is not possible. You'd need your rest. She is not going to ask... For she knows the answer. She knows all your answers. She does not want to face rejection in its face again. She wonders where you are.

      I am so freaking mad. The blood rush makes my head spin. It gives me sleepless nights, it makes me want to throttle her. I so want to fry her dumb ass butt right now. Quit that innocent stuff. It does not work. I really wonder if she is just stupid, so just so darn freaking stupid. I have been patient, gentle and kind. I have been helpful. I have not used any flowery language on her. I have attempted to speak slowly and simply. I felt like I was talking to a cardboard. Even when I was assisting my sister in her experiment at the kindergarten, speaking to those kids were so much easier. Even when they did not respond, they did what they had to do. *beep* I so want to yell profanity at her. But I will not. Fed up.  I want to go to the beach. I want to go on a shopping spree in Little India. I want to eat all the French delicacies available here. I want to go to Brunei.  Joy-is-Happy shall now be known as 'Joy is Horny'. She actually messaged me during class just to ask some very personal questions. Right... It's weird. Just don't do it if you are scared or uncomfortable with it. Don't regret it and enjoy what you can. I sure hope he's not some maniac though. Don't get your heart too torn up. I feel it is not going the right way. All he cares about is himself.  I miss you so.  Till we meet again, I'll be waiting here...

      Something special, something simple, something stupid.  And I miss you.  Every thought and every move, it's you. It always has been. Some things just never change. I am not sure if I want it to.  It was such a long and draggy day. Started classes at 0900h and by 1100h, I felt like I had spent the entire day on campus already... Read: 0800h to 1930h. I was exhausted. Mind was blank after that. Had to do a mock interview for Feature Writing. In preparation for CA2, where we would have to take on the role of the interviewer and interview one of the Lecturer... High possibility of getting Mr Rajan. I mean,  Rajan . We are not allowed to greet him any other way except "Rajan". Nice man. I prepared my interview for Hidetoshi Nakata. Was given the honor to take on the role of some cartoon character... Thanks to  AZNY ... Had no idea what the cartoon is about. Just crapped my way through it... She was a very helpful interviewer though...   Peters  was friendly today. Actually said HI to her. Attempt at studying in the library during the break yielded a big zero. It was the ultimate test of my patience today. I have enough things on my hands as it is. That ever so "eccentric" lady just has to screw up all the time. Ask her to do something, "Oh, I'm not sure how to do it... Can get someone to help?" Tell her step by step, specifically how to do it, and she goes, "Oh okay..." And STILL screws up. *Beep* *beep* B*tch. Such a compliment to her. *Beep* Ever so kind of us, we decided to educate her a little more. *BEEP* *BEEP*up B*tch. We went through that class with our PTN in Year ONE! *Beep* Patiently, we taught it to her all over again. What an 'attitude' she has. The self-proclaimed eccentric. It is an insult to the word. Really. I am not going to handle her anymore. No more. Next.  Met  Joy -is-Happy during our break today. She yelled my name - typical style of JUSTICE! - and asked what outfit was I wearing. Hmmm... She's always in Black top and denim... I like long tops over pants. I feel so comfortable in them. Relaxed. No restrictions. Anyhow, I wanted to answer "Maternity wear!" But I was just too tired. Said a quiet HI - which by the way, is so not me - and gave a little wave. Maternity. A little secret between the two of us... And not forgetting the other two V V VIPs.  Treasure.  Not to forget, finally met Mr Levis today. After a week! He in his toot glasses. Still hot.  Supper. Great food. No company.  Oh yes, company of the Digimon. The Digimon revolution is back. The craze was on when I was like 10? Now it is back. I am addicted to it. Although I have no opponent yet. Not till my brother gets his alive and kicking again. We'll see.  Where were you?  I wanted you  here. Maybe I did not spell it out clearly enough. Well, I really wanted you here. Time does not matter. Now it no longer matters.  You are always on my mind. I miss you even when you are next to me. I miss you more so now.  I need you here, but you are gone. More important are the other things. I want to be here for you. I know my lips should be sealed. For out of love for you, I will but silence my heart.  Till we meet again, I'll be missing you.

      Today was a "blast". The on-camera presentation went on fine. Lecturer Loh is a really nice and fine man. No, not that he'd give me any concession, I just know he is a nice guy. That is why I do not bother to correct him although he mispronounces my name. I would correct anyone else. Especially Ms Peters. Fancy her telling me how to pronounce my own name. "X can be pronounced like a Z too you know..." Whatever. Oh well, Mr Loh said it was good and he kept telling me how I did NOT screw up. I just do not believe him. Sure hope the written script will hold. Anyway, Ms Peters is alright for now. She cannot believe that I would want to be a home maker in future. Why? Do I not look domesticated? So what if I can not cook and do not clean? So what if I enjoy the process of washing rice till the water gets clear? I want to be a good wife who waits at home for the man of her life to come home. Yeah. I want to. I never had thoughts of being this super career woman. Really. I do want to be a millionaire by my own merit by the time I am 30 though. I am getting a start. I really am.  Watch me .  Rosary started today. It was great. I managed to keep my knees to the ground throughout the 40 five minutes of solemn devotion. Babe came over today. I am really feeling quite down about the week... Whatever that is left of it. Today will be the last I see of him for now. Today has come and gone. I will miss him. Always so busy with church work. Christ centered and doing His work. I know them all. I know I should be understanding and supportive. And I am. I would not say anymore. I guess it must have been wrong for me to have mentioned *beep* CC. I just feel things are all pushed on to him. It's so unfair. Yeah. Unfair. I have not used this word in the longest time. Anyhow, I guess you will read this someday... I am going to miss you. I will. I am already feeling the  sense of lost . I will be sad, but I won't show it. No I won't. I cannot. Life goes on.  Time waits for no man .  So alone. So alone in this world.  Where are you now?  I have got to know. Moving on and breaking another heart? I know someday you'd meet someone new. A part of me wants to know, the other just lives in denial.  Just let me know when you have moved on...  So I can too...

      I am so dead. So very dead. Dead tired. Plain unexplainable exhaustion. I am so dead because I have absolutely no inspiration as to how to go about my on-camera presentation for tomorrow. I have no idea how to start it. Hallmark is not helping. The search engines just unable to crank up any information for me. This is starting to -crap- big time.  School today was a complete waste of time. After school was hilarious. We finally made it to watch MeanGirls. It is so darn funny. I think we made too much noise in there... But ah, doesn't matter. Babe commented, "Three mean girls going to watch..." Right. It was fun. Lunch at Swensens... The standard there has dipped too... Waffles after the movie. Life.  Alright, back to writing now.

       Woah . Back from the very hectic weekend. Been busy with church activities mostly. Spent Saturday morning scribbling through the darn Legal System and Contracts script. I kind of screwed up the last question. My argument was so skewed. I concluded that those outfits with drug motifs should not be banned.  Spent the next half of the day in good old IHM. Reading through my Consumer Behavior textbook and trying my best to concentrate, while the band played away. I think I did not do too badly, although progress was crawling. Sunday was yet another day spent in church. Christ the King. Was freezing my butt off throughout the entire mass. Although we were all squeezed on the bench together, the warmth was hardly there. Freaking air-conditioner. Makes my skin really dry. It is in its worse state. So is my hair. Darn!  Anyhow, the Consumer Behavior CA went pretty well. I could remember my facts... However, it is strange how I could write so much for a question worth eight marks, and write the same amount for a question worth 12 marks. Something wrong there isn't it? Thought I got all that fact down.  Time passed really fast today. Finally got the film we are suppose to produce a trailer for. CA1 of Digital Media Applications. Have to do an on-camera presentation about the same film to promote at the Film Festival. My script is not done yet and I have no idea how to go about doing it. Suggestions anyone?   Happiness is to love and be loved... I am so in love.

      Legal System and Contracts. Did alright. A B grade. Crappy. Lousy memory. What happened to my years of History memory work? I could rattle off the entire textbook at the snap of the finger. I can even tell you specifyically where on the page I took the facts from. Yes, memorising stuff is not the best way to learn, but I managed to score and get myself a well deserved A. I am sure I can repeat that feat. I did them all in one night, and I still remember them till now. In other words, it works. Memorising things do work for me. I will work at it.  Digital Media Applications. Trailer due soon. I managed to save a bit of my work. Intending to do the entire thing at home. Only thing, my laptop has caught a bug... IE isn't working. I'll have to fix it soon.  I want to watch a movie. I want to watch it with you. I thought it'd be good to watch it next week. Such a nice date and such a nice day. I am sadden by the negative reply. What can I do? Nothing. STUPID me still trying my luck. Aren't I tired of all that rejection? Time and again?  Peters said today that if you want a partner, look for one that is low maintainence. If you are the partner, be the low maintainence. Emotionally as well as materialistically, I feel, I admit, I am on the high scale. Oh well, I do not feel like talking about this now. BYE.

      STUPID STUPID STUPID! Blame it on my own stupidity. You stupid girl. Such a disappointment. You placed yourself and your group members into the grade that'd mess up your finals. Always so haughty, acting as if you know the whole world. Complacency gets you no where near success. Dare you to say she'd screw up. She did not. You did. You screwed up big time. Spoke for two minutes and passed the stage on. You stupid kid.  Complacent. Arrogance. Attitude. Perhaps it is due to the fact that I have seen the world. Perhaps it is due to the fact that I have not seen enough of the real world. Anyhow, I do feel that I do know certain things about the world. From books and from my travels... I just don't know reality. Ever since moving out of the "mainstream" education of College, I find myself hearing about a totally different kind of life. The real world perhaps. Being in a certain kind of school all my 16 years, I think we have been too sheltered. All the people of similar social group, where everyone seem to be able to relate to one another really well, buy the same stuff, eat the same food, live in the same kind of houses... Learn and grow together, race together, fail together and make merry.  Now that I am beginning to see the real world, my eyes are opened, but my heart is still a reluctant organ. Not just an organ... Heart, the beginning of everything. My heart is reluctant to open up to people who are different. People who I deem are different. People whom I used to consider under priviledge. Note, I said, used. Past tense. I am beginning to question myself. WHO is the under priviledge one? Me or them? I'd say Me. The naive and spoilt kid. Growing up in a sheltered environment. Unable to face the real world. Or rather, refuse to acknowledge the real world. The harsh reality of the world where there are young teens getting pregnant, getting involved in drugs, getting killed in gang fight, getting killed in motor accidents, gang raped. Never have I heard of such incidents when I was in St Nicholas. My only source is through the newspapers. No real life experiences. No one I knew personally. The reality of the world. I did not know. How stupid. Always in my tinkle bell world. Never really grew out of it. Tinkle bell still visits me now and then. She never really went away. Just that she no longer ask me to play Barbie and live in Barbie world. Tinkle bell now asks me to do other things. Like eat all that junk I want. Play with Lucky. Talk on the phone. Surf the Internet. Go shopping. Tinkle bell did not go away. Tinkle bell merely grew with me. Matured with me... If we ever did mature. Come to think of it, Tinkle bell is a good companion, even if she is mostly the root of most of my bad doings. Yeah. Tinkle bell. What will I be without her? All those counseling I was conned into going... Tinkle bell is still here. She comes at the wrong time some time. Fret not, I can still be in control... If and when I choose to.   I want to see the real world. I want to see the harsh reality of it all. I want to realize how fortunate I have been. I want to realize that life is not just a bed of thornless roses. I want to learn not to take things for granted. I have to learn to tone down on my arrogance.  Translate my haughtiness to become my talent. Put my gifts to good use.  I really admire young people of my age, who manage a job and an education. They earn by the thousands, and still manage to score in their studies. Their street wiseness and perseverance is something I have to learn. To those who are working and studying, my respects. Honestly. I really wonder how you all do it.  Viewed my DMA presentation today. The script which I was fussing over. Did not do that badly. I am consoled. Treated myself today.  Fellowship tonight was good. I ate too much.  I miss you babe. Thank you!  For those broken hearted, take heart in these words...   GOD NEVER TAKES AWAY SOMETHING WITHOUT GIVING YOU SOMETHING BETTER IN RETURN.   TRUST AND BELIEVE.  It has happened before.

      And out of my life.  He has died. He died while I was rushing through, calling the dudes in my group... Questionnaire due at 9am. Woah. Kind old WT rushed down to school only to be running around trying to get the computers to print. Those f-B*tches took the whole row of computers with the printer. Stupid library. What's wrong with the library now? We used to be able to print from every single computer!!!! Crap.   Softcopy due at lunch. Screwed.  Creating that trailer... It is getting tougher. My line doesn't flow smoothly anymore. Will have to edit it back home. Have to get it done this weekend.   Thought I had things all settled already. Now it seems it's back to "all messed up". Credits to my extremely unproductive weekend. I am so far behind schedule. Evenings are gone with the many nights of prayer and fellowship. Not that I am complaining... I do enjoy the time spent and all that good food. I actually enjoy the preparation part, although I do not do all that much. So much food at such a late hour. Makes me FAT. Back to square one.

      At 1012h on the eight of August year two thousand and four, it has become official that he has grown up, ready to fight and face the world.  Can't smile without you. I lied when I said I could. You know I can't.  Target of this weekend is not half met. Yet to start revision for management CA. Yet to prepare for presentation tomorrow. Plenty of sleep yeah. Feeling aching and heaty. Splitting headache.  I am so used to not having you around.

      I'll always remember the warmth of your embrace. I'll guard the puzzle of our memory. Love is a long long journey. You showed me the first step. I cannot imagine tomorrow without you. I've lost my way. Walked into the map of yesterday. Happiness is a gift from above. Tears are the records of failed love. I think again and again. Still I am not sure how to take the next step. Missing you, I'll count to three. I'll stop crying when I reach three. Let tonight be the night our love comes to an end. Take away the happiness you brought me. I won't cry. I won't cry no more. I'll always remember our love story. I'll bring your love, one step at a time. And I'll walk towards the future. I don't care about the harsh world. Time will heal me. I'll forget the joy you brought.

      Hurt? Worried? Perhaps this is the price to pay for loving him. Forget it. Don't wait for the disastrous reply. It's all his fault. Ignore him. I've decided to take a long vacation from love and relationships. Say no more, fear no more. I've a secret thought in my heart. I do not care. I do not care no more. I do not care if my heart still loves him or not. No matter what he says or how he questions, no way will he know about my future plans. Don't be silly. Don't be fake. Even if he is no longer my love story. Don't love me, leave me. Because I've found a way to be happy. I'll sing, I'll dance and let you vanish from my world. I'll forget you. Goodbye. I won't believe in the novelty of love. I'll run away, just let me run away. I'll wonder why, wonder why love has no logic. Forget it, ignore him, don't look at him. I can fly freely.  Who says I will never smile again? Who says I cannot live a better life?  I'll fly away.
