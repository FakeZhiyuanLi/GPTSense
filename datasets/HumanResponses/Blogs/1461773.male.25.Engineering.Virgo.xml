      Well I finally got around to editing the video that so many people had been complaining about.  I decided to go with real media format, so some for of the RealPlayer is necessary to play all of the videos.  I'l be sure to add this note on the welcome page.

      Well it seems that I have gotten some positive feedback from the launch of the website.  There are still some things that I need to take a look at for the site:  1)Family Tree software 2)Implement sub-domains

      Well it looks like the testing was successful.  The blog postings are showing up on my domain and it looks like it's a go.  For all of you that I have been telling that I was planning to publish a website one day, here it is!!!  And it's about time.  I purchased this domain almost a month ago and have just now gotten around to this.   And as a side note: Dreamhost is an excellent web host  There are a few things that I still want to figure out and add to the site: 1) Figure out the Quicktime/Real streaming server for audio and video 2) Play around with Family Tree software that can add HTML to my site  (There is some cool stuff out there...) 3) Continue to add photos to the site.  (I just got my digital camera as of last week as well)  Well wish me luck.  And be sure to send any comments and/or criticism to me@johnwesleythomas.com  Holla.

      It's been a while since I had put a blog entry on this site.  Man, more than a week.  I need to get used to this "journal type" entry thing.  I never kept one when I was growing up.  Well anyways things are good.  My last entry I spoke on my softball team right before the game.  Softball We actually won the game last Tuesday and also the one this week.  We actually have a two game winning streak and are in fourth place.  In two weeks we went from last to fourth.  So what if there are only 6 teams in my division, it still means alot to me.  The biggest reason is that we actually started to play defense.  Everyone is comfortable in their positions and has confidence on what plays to make.  Out last game is next week against the third place team.  With that win we clinch the the fourth seed in the playoffs that begin the week after.  With a loss we clinch the fifth seed since we will not win the tie-breaker with the team behind us.  It doesn't reall matter, since what ever team we match up with in the other division for the playoffs, no matter the seed, we can beat.  And we almost did during the regular reason with our previous shaky defence.  As for me, I finally broke out my slump.  I went 4-4 yesterday with two runs scored and I think 1 RBI.  I still haven't had a HR in 3 games, but i still own the league lead with 12 HR's.  This last game, I just stopped thinking about the HR's and had little dinky base hits.  I think I was letting the HR lead thing get to my head a little. ;-)  Site I should be making a few more additions to the site in the next couple of days.  I have some new photos and also some new favorite links  Go White Sox!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Well today is Tuesday and if the weather holds up we will have another softball game.  We are something like 2-11, but I think today we play a team with the very same record.  We are the two worst teams in the league, so the winner of this game avoids getting the worst record in the entire league.  So I guess you can call this game "The Toilet Bowl" or the "Worst Series", I don't know.  So to prepare for the game I went to the batting cage on Sunday and hit 150 balls in the cage.  I was mad at myself for having such a horrible game last week.  I went 0 for 2 and we lost the game on a 15-0 mercy rule in the fifth inning.  I guess we didn't play that bad as a team, but I did horrible at the plate.  A pop-fly and a weak grounder to the shortstop.  They had a pretty good defense, which is why they are in first place and also undefeated.  Even still that was the worst and most lopsided game that I had ever been involved with in my 2-year softball career. ;-)  Maybe I'll try to post some the stats for the season on the website one day.  We only have a couple of games left before the playoffs, which includes every team and is also double elimination.

      Well it's been a minute since I had an entry on my weblog, so I was sittin' at work thinking what the heck.  I might as well put something down.    Not alot has been going on since my last entry.  I have a few more photos to add to the site from a couple of parties that I have been too in the past couple of weeks.  I need to mess around with the formatting of a few photos to add of myself and a few old digitized photos that I have from school (Columbia and Morehouse).  I guess one thing that is missing from the site is "ME".  Since the domain is JohnWesleyThomas, I guess it would make sense to add something about myself.  I might add a few photos along with my resume or something.  It kind of bothers me a little bit to put stuff on the site about me because I don't want to come off being a vain person, but I guess it's a must that I put up a few things.  Otherwise the site lacks  personality or maybe it should be called www.johnwesleythomas'friends.com. :-)  All well, so I guess it's decided.  More stuff about me to follow.  I have a softball game today, so hopefully we won't get a usual outcome of a big "L".  We probably will though since we are playing the first place team in our division.  We play hard every game and everyone on the team trys their best, but we just cannot get a victory to save out lives.  We are 2-10 now and one of those victories was a forfeit.  It's a sad situation, but at least we are laughing and having fun right.  Or is that just what losers say.  I don't know.  I definitely need to add a few photos of the team on the site, as well as some of our stats.  I have something like 14 home runs, which is like twice what I had the whole season last year.  I don't know what's going on, maybe I'm letting my losing frustrations out on the ball.  If so, I'll try to continue it today.  Later.

      For those that don't know, TIVO is an electronic personal video recorder (PVR). The problem is that you can buy a TIVO at Best Buy or whatever for about $300, which isn't too bad.  It gives all the power of a VCR without having to keep up with video cassettes or tapes.  All of the recordings are stored digitally on the PC.  They can later be transferred to recordable DVD's if you wanted to conserve some storage space on your PC.   The problem is that TIVO also charges a subscription fee for it's services that include obtaining programming information online periodically. There are certain projects alive out on the Internet that give instruction for creating your own version of this PVR w/o any subscription fees.  My favorite has been  urlLink MythTV. .  I just started purchasing all of the necessary pieces to build this box, so hopefully I will keep the site updated and give notices of my progression.  I'll also try to leave some further details of the MythTV box on the site as I iron out the details.  Later!!!!!!!!!!

I'll try to run home and get my camera today, so that I can add some photos to the site.  Later.

      Well today marks the second year anniversary of the 911 attacks on D.C. and NYC.  Sometimes I can hardly believe that I was actually that close to everything.  On the day of September 11, 2001 I was in my last semester of grad school at Columbia University.  I think that the sharpest memory in my mind during that whole scenerio was the amount of confussion going on.  I can remember everyone thinking it was an accident and then it was a large scale terrorist attack with all of the planes containing chemical gases.  I was actually told to go inside and shut my windows and not to turn on the AC for fear of contamination.  Communication was also difficult since most cellular lines were full or down.  Even the landline phones were filled to capacity.  No one could contact me from anywhere and I could not even check on the 5 friends that I know worked in at the WTC.  Thank goodness that everyone that I knew personally was OK and escaped.  But alot of others didn't or weren't that lucky.    I was sure to have a moment of silence this morning to remember those that were lost as well as their families who are struggling on without them.  I recommend that everyone else does the same.   urlLink CNN 911 Tribute

      Well my work football team from a year ago has been disbanded.  We were not given enough notice to get all of the paperwork in on time.  So I officially became a free agent.  At first I wasn't going to play this year since the team got disbanded, but I found out that one of my teammates joined the same team that had been asking me to join them for the past two weeks.  This new team is pretty good and have been playing together for more than 10 years.  So in a way we are the rookies and we have to earn their respect.  It should be interesting though, they have a pretty good team from what I could remember from last year.  The captain told me that they had been to the past 4 championship games, but hadn't won it yet.  I guess this is why he went after a few of my teammates pretty hard for the past two weeks.  I guess he feels that we can put him over the top this year.  Who knows.  All I do know is that at least this year I will not have to play both ways.  They have almost 20 people on that team, so they constantly switch in subs.  Going both ways last year was murder. ;-)  Anyways it should still be fun.

      Well another year, another Labor day.  For some reason Labor Day is always one of my favorite holidays.  Maybe because it was always at the beginning of the school year.  Maybe it's because there is always somone having a BBQ on that day.  Or maybe it's because it is always close to my birthday.  I don't know.  This year Labor Day is kind of cold and rainy, so I didn't make any trips to any BBQ's.  I just sort of stayed in my neighborhood and ran a few errands and took care of things around the house.  I installed a new amplifier inside my car.  I repainted the front door of the townhouse.  I remounted my CD changer in the Rodeo.  And also took care of some cleaning inside the house.  So I guess I got alot accomplished today.  Too bad everyday can't be like this. ;-)

      This is just a test to find out if a new blogging software is worth switching too.  The new software is  urlLink WBloggar.   It seems to have a few more editting features like using a word processor such as Word and enable user to add files, images, and links a little bit easier as well.  I might end up sticking with this if it holds up and the releases keep progressing.  We'll see

      Since I have had so many problems with the local phone companies in the area (AT&T, Comcast, SBC) I haven't had any local phone service in a while.  No monthly plans really fit my needs.  I really don't use the home phone that much since I have had a cell phone for a while now that includes long distance and unlimited nights and weeekend minutes.  But I still felt the need to have one, especially since I can remember during certain times my home phone was all I had while going through 9/11 in NYC.  But really I occasionally use it if my cell phone battery was dead and also if I needed to send a fax from by computer.  Just recently I discovered  urlLink Vonage .  Basically they provide me with a AD converter to turn any of my cheap analog phones into an IP phone.  The negetive is that my phone will go out during any Internet or power outages.  The positive is that I get unlimited long distance calls anywhere in the US and Canada.  I also get free CallID, voicemail, Call forwarding, ........etc.  I can even recieve a email whenever I get a new voicemail and can even listen to the message over the Internet while I am at work or whatever, from any computer online.  It's cool because it is also transportable.  I can take my AD converter to any broadband connection and can make and recieve calls at any time with any plain, cheap analog phone.  It's bananas.  And this is all for only about $25/month.  I'm looking forward to the installation.  I should be recieving the shipment in the next few days.  I'll be sure to keep the site posted.  Peace.

      I forgot to mention that I am another step closer to completing my MythTV "Tivo" box.  I just ordered the motherboard and case today and I am planning on picking up my wireless keyboard/mouse on the way home.  After this I plan on picking up a new item every pay day till the end of the year.   By that time I should have everything I need to get the project underway.    Actually I have co-worker who is attempting the same thing.  He just told me today that the process is painless and he already has a number of the modules downloaded and functioning.  So I guess I will find out soon enough.   urlLink Asus Pundit ::Includes the motherboard, sound card, video card, DVI output, composite output, 4-in-1 card reader, and other junk   urlLink Gyration keyboard/mouse combo ::Wireless RF keyboard and mouse which allows mouse movements in mid-air.

      Well once again I have been slacking in my blogging.  But this time it is not my fault.  My home PC has been out of whack for the past two weeks.  I finally got fed up with it and decided to re-format all my drives and give it a fresh install of XP.  Now apparently the problem has gotten worse.  Now the PC won't even boot up.  It likes to give me memory allocation and windows login errors.  I really don't see how I did that with just a re-format and a windows re-install.  All well, perhaps I will bring my laptop home tonight and try to work it out.  But I really don't know where to start since I don't understand the problem.  Anyways, I made it back safely from my trip home to Texas.  I got some great pictures of the high school football game as well as the Spurs game.  It turned out that the ceremony for David Robinson was pretty nice.  He deserves all of the recognition that he is getting.  I was also able to grab a few pictures from Karis' farewell dinner.  It occured the same night that I made it back to Chicago, so I was pretty beat, but I am glad that I got to spend some time with her before she left for Indiana.  I'm going to miss her, she was one of my best friends up here in Chicago.  It is going to be alot different without her.  I'll try to post up some of the pics and update whenever I can bring my PC back from the twilight zone.  If worst comes to worst I'll just bring in a zip disk to work and do some damage during a lunch break or something.  Holla later.

      Well once again I've been slacking on my blogs.    Not too much is new with me.  I just got my first flu shot.  It wasn't as dramatic as I thought it would be.  There was pretty much nothing to it.  I just had to stick around a few extra minutes after the shot to make sure I didn't blow up or anything from an allergic reaction.  I'm really looking forward to my trip back to Texas this weekend.  I'm going to get a chance to check out my little sister being a cheerleader at a varsity football game and I am also going to go to a Spurs game where they will be retiring David Robinson's jersey.  I'll be sure to bring back and post alot of pictures from both events.   urlLink Sister's High School Football Website   urlLink David Robinson's Jersey Retirement Ceremony

Hopefully kid sis' can help me out with some of the needs of my Mom and Grandma around the house.  But then again maybe not, she is a teenager. :-)  Well wish me luck.

      I finally have had some free time to put together my Tivo PC.  I am still having a few issues with the sound driver, but I'll be purchasing a cable wire from Radio Shack this evening to give it a good test.  Hopefully I can get this thing running before I leave for Christmas vaction back in TX.  I really haven't had alot of time to put everything together since I have been out of town so often the past two months.  By the way, I have a few pictures from my second visit to Halifax, Nova Scotia and also my first Chicago Bears game.  Who knows when I'll get time to upload them, but I'll make an attempt tonight if I can figure out my Tivo PC issues.  Later.

      I'm still not too sure where I will be bowling at this year.  Ever since I have been in Chicago I have always been moving on the day of the Super Bowl.  The first one in 2002 is when I moved from Texas to Chicago.  In 2003 is when I moved from my apartment to the townhouse where I am at now.  I don't even know what to do with myself now that I am not moving this winter.  I had better move next winter so that I am not in this situation again. ;-)  Anyways, I will be pulling for the Panters since they knocked off my Cowboys in the Wildcard Game.  I hope they pull it out, it should be a defensive, low scoring, grind it out kind of game.  I'm looking forward to it.  In fact I might just meet some people at a sports bar and watch the game so that I can concentrate on the actual game.  I remember back in 2000 when it was the Rams vs. the Titans.  That was one of the most exciting Super Bowls in my generation and I bareley remember it because I was at a party with music and people that don't even like football talking too much.  Well I don't have any new additions to the site, but one thing that I do have on my to-do list is to convert all of the video files to mpeg2.  I'll be sure to get it eventually.

      I gotta say that this year's NFL playoffs are one of the best ever.  There has really only been a couple of decisive games out the 16 that have been played so far.  One of those non-decisive games being my Cowboys, but all well.  They over-achieved anyways.  Next year they'll be back again and even better.

We had seats in the second to last row on the side of the new Soldier's Field facing Lake Michigan.  By the second quarter I could not feel my fingers or my toes.  But you know what.  I would do it again in a second.  The game is so much slower and easier to see than it is on television.  I just have to conserve and get ready for that $65 hit.  That's a far cry from a $5 ticket at the Alamodome. ;-)

Anyways, at least I completed my TIVO PC the week I got back from Christmas.  It's cool.  I already have a few recordings that I have.  The next step is to purchase a DVD recorder so I can start archiving some movies and Spurs games.  I also want to get some of the other modules working as well.  There's a music jukebox, video player, web server (program recordings on the web), game emulator (to play old SNES and NES games), weather monitor, news feed, and image viewer.  I'll get to it eventually I guess.  Just like the photo updates. ;-)

      Well we are finally in a new year.  Time to start up those resolutions once again.  One of mine is to stay in better shape.  I work out once in a while, but I need to become more disciplined and also eat alot better.  Time to minimize the trips to Mickey D's and reduce my carbs intake.  Another resolution of mine is the leave all of the extra baggage that accumulated from 2003 in the year 2003.  The past is the past and there is nothing that we can do about it.  It's all in God's hands now.  All we can do is just look to the future and try to make that better.  Well I have some new photos from my Christmas vacation that I will be posting, so I'll have to get to that.  Later.

      I finally got the chance to add some new photos to the site.  Last Sunday I got the opportunity to go to the Chicago Auto Show.  It was pretty cool.  I've gotten the opportunity to go to the show for the past three years.  I can't say that this was one of the best, but it was still cool.  This definitely had to be the year of the trucks for the show.  I was really impressed with them.  I was a bit disappointed that there was only one Toyota Tundra in the whole show, but I got put onto a new truck.  The  urlLink Nissan Titan .  I was really feelin' this truck.  The size.  The power.  This  urlLink link  shows how the Titan compares with some of the truck big boys, including the Tundra and Ford F-150.  You can see how the Titan can hang with the big boys.  I'll definitely have to look into this if I can get the power of a F-150 for about $5,000.00 less.  We'll see.  Maybe one day I could be flossin' this.   urlLink Nissan Titan

      Well the Major Leagues are under way.  Barry Bonds has just become the  urlLink third greatest homerun hitter  of all time.  The weather is starting to turn up.  We may actually  urlLink hit the 70's this weekend !!!!  So it is only right that the Motorola Softball League get underway.  We actually have our first team practice today.  Even today is still kind of  urlLink cold , I am still exited to get back out on the crater-filled diamond.  Hopefully this season will turn out better than our previous two (see archives for my previous frustrations ;-))  We brought back the core of our team from two years ago, but we have picked up a couple of free agents as well as lost a few people.  Actually our starting pitcher sold us out so she could get a master's degree, so that's a nice piece of the puzzle that's missing, but we'll manage.  Thanks Kriste. ;-)  Anyways, as far as the site.  I'm really starting to get a real good handle on video editing and I think I have found a nice format for all of my videos on the website.  I decided to go with an Xvid codec, which is basically MPEG4.  This codec is basically just an open-source version of the commonly-known Divx codec, but it seems to give me better audio/video syncing results.  Pretty soon I will be converting all of the video over to this format.  Until later.  Holla later.

      I know that it's been a minute since I posted.  I guess I have just been mad busy.  Not a whole lot has happened since my last post.  I guess that was around Super Bowl time.    Well I found a new project to get involved in.  I just got a  urlLink Tapwave Zodiac .  This is a tight new PDA that has a few features on it to play games.  I've been eying this product since last November when I dropped and broke my old Palm IIIxe.  And since this device runs the Palm OS, I just uploaded all of the data that backed from the old IIIxe.  The tightest feature on this device is the gaming features.  It has an analog controller, shoulder buttons, and four color buttons as controls.  So far I keep all my regular info (numbers, calandar, to-do listss, etc), plus an Nintendo emulator, an MP3 player, and video player.  I'm looking to take this device anywhere I go for now on.  It's my new best friend. ;-)  Once I finish up with this project I think my next plan of action needs to be with my car.  She's starting to die on me.  I'm having transmission problems, the breaks are about to go out, and I am leaking a whole lot of oil and cooling fluid.  I already know that if I want to stop the leaking it's going to cost me a pretty penny.  Last I remember it was around a G.  The first priority will definitely be the transmission though.  I think I ruined the third gear.  I can't imagine how much that is going to cost to repair.   I might just have to wait and see how necessary these repairs are.  I can stand the fluid leaking, but I can't do nothing if my transmission is slowly dying on me.  We'll see.

      I added a few video clips from my Auntie's graduation as well as a clip from a Cubs game I went to.  I must be on a roll, that's two updates and three blogs in two days.  Really I just have some more free time since my Spurs got bounced out of the NBA playoffs.  All well, maybe it was a blessing in disguise. ;-)

      I just added some photos of my new little niece, my auntie's graduation, and a Cubs game that I went to a couple of weeks ago.  I haven't had the chance to meet my little niece yet, but I'm definitely looking forward to it.  I hope the little girl forgives me for this when she gets older.  I knew her pops was going to send me some messed up photos, but it's the best that I could do. :-)

      Well once again I'll decided to update the design of the site.  I just wanted something simple that would load up fast on dial-up modems.  So I felt that this was sort, sweet, and to the point.  I'll also be adding some additional photos to the site pretty soon.  I have some photos and videos of my new god-neice, my aunt's graduation, and also a recent Cubs game that I went to in the freezing cold.  I also want to add additional info on my PC Tivo and Zodiac, but also format all of the available video on the site to one format (probably MPEG2).  Knowing me, don't hold your breath for these updates. ;-)

      Well it's always a good day when you see the Lakers lose the chance at winning another championship.   urlLink This article  shows how over the entire NBA Finals history the Lakers have appeared in almost half of them (48%).  That percentage is more than any franchise in any US professional sport, including the Yankees World Series appearences (only 40%).    After all, I am born and raised in San Antonio and a huge  urlLink Spurs  fan.  They've been our natural born rival for many years.  Even back in the George Gervin era, so I was born to hate the Lakers.  But I think something that satisfies me even more is to know that  urlLink Joe Dumars, the Detroit Pistons GM, has become the first black GM to win an NBA championship .  It's pretty hard to believe with the high percentage of blacks involved with the league, but it's true.  But I guess this is still America though.  And just last year  urlLink Robert Johnson  became the first black owner of an NBA franchise, the new  urlLink Charlotte Bobcats .  I guess he was so proud of himself that he named the team after himself ("Bob").

      Well I finally posted the photos from my visit to Dallas, TX for my little cousin's high school graduation.  It was cool to be back in Texas and to see friends and family.  The photos include the ceremony and also the BBQ we had a few days later.  Edit:  Just added two new videos as well   urlLink Aunt CeCe on Trampoline   urlLink My Cousin Vinny Getting his Diploma

      I know some might say I'm a little too old for video games, but I'm still into it.  I just bought a new baseball game,  urlLink All Star Baseball 2005  and am thinking about picking up another one,  urlLink Transformers .   I may not have the spare time like I did when I was younger, but I still find a way once in a while.  I find myself working late and then working out at the gym and not finding my home till about 9 or 10.  By that time I just feel like checking my email, watching Sportscenter, and going to sleep.  So my gaming time has definitely been slowing down.  In fact with the NBA playoffs occuring the past month, I've been coming home or going to a bar and watching a different game every night as well.  I definitely need to regain my focus.  Here's a few screen shots of the hot Transformers game I'm thinking of picking up later on tonight.

      Well I made it back to the Chi in one piece from my long 5-day weekend down in Texas.  I got a chance to catch up with some friends and family that I haven't seen since the holiday season.  It was fun.    Everyone was in town since one of my little cousins graduated high school and is probably headed to  urlLink Prarie View A&M.   I took some pictures and videos, so look for those real soon.  Actually one of the videos is pretty funny and includes one of my Aunt's falling on her face on a trampeline.  Classic. :-)    Later.

      Man, I've really been slacking on my blog entries.  Just been busy I guess.  Working crazy hours, involved in afterwork athletic teams (softball, volleyball), and I also picked up a new PS2 game urlLink , NCAA College Football .      I'm looking forward to heading down to Louisville, KY this weekend.  It should be cool.  We got the big  urlLink Tyson fight  on Friday night.  Hopefully he can start to make a small comeback and get his life back together.  I'll be cheering for him.  Actually I just found out that  urlLink Leila Ali  is going to be the undercard for the fight.  That should be cool too.  I also want to pick up an o urlLink riginal Lousville Slugger , the official baseball bat of the Major Leagues.      I'll be sure to take lots of photos and post them up on the site.

      Well I've been looking around for a new phone to replace my old  urlLink P270  on  the Sprint PCS network for a while now.  One reason is that I am  not too satisfied with the service and also they refuse to sell  Motorola phones for multiple reasons.  So I was forced to use a  rigged up P270 without any roaming capabilities and those charges have  been rediculous when I travel.  So in order to stay brand loyal  I've decided to switch phones and also services.  I know I'm going  to miss the PCS-to-PCS unlimited minutes, but I'll feel better when my  wallet is fatter.      One prerequisite of my new phone is that it had to be on a network with  a reasonable data plan.  Another is that it had to have bluetooth  (I'm addicted to that feature now).   I think that I have  finally found my match.  The new  urlLink Motorola A630  meets  all of these demands plus some.  It has a QWERTY keyboard, digital  camera, speakerphone, and email capabilities.  It's supposed to be  due out on the Cingular (home town San Antonio based company) network  next month, but I won't be holding my breath.  I'll expect to pick  up this phone up around Christmas time 2004. :-)

      Believe it or not, after having a Sprint PCS phone for nearly 6 years I just figured out how to send SMS messages to it.  The whole time I was convinced that my account @sprintpcs.com was the correct address, but that is just a webmail account setup.  I was sure that the webmail account and SMS/text messaging were connected and that it was simply broken.  It turns out that I was wrong and the correct address is @messaging.sprintpcs.com.  The funny thing is that I found this out while on Southwest Airlines website while setting up flight status notifications.  They have the address of all major providers on  urlLink this site .  And I couldn't find this same info on the Sprint PCS website anywhere.  Go figure!!!  Well nothing much for me, just putting the finishing touches on my travel plans to Kentucky to see the  urlLink Mike Tyson fight  at the end of the month.  It should be tight.  I'll be sure to bring back plenty of photos and post them on the site.  Later.

      Man, well my boy Jemerson put me onto the idea of going down to Brazil in early February.  Sounds cool.  I've really been feenin' to go on a real vacation, since I have been working I really haven't been on one.  So I'm looking forward to it.  I'm just now starting to get my feelers out and try to find out more about the trip.  I actually have found about 3 people that I work with that have already made the trip.  They put me onto a website to help me out:   urlLink Rio de Janeiro website   This site has everything from brazilian history, hotel packages, photos, and nightlife guides.  I'm excited already.

      Well I know for sure that it is my mother's 1st cousin, so I think that means cousin once removed to me.  Anyways I took time off of work on Friday to attend the funeral of my mom's cousin.  This is a person that unfortunately I did not have the pleasure of spending alot of time with while I was growing up, but I feel that I saw a snapshot of her life at her funeral this past weekend.  The funeral had to be one of the nicest that I had ever been too.  Just the amount of people that were there to give love and support to the surviving family members was unbelievable.  Everyone had positive things to say and some had tributes that lasted almost an hour.  My mom's cousin was a person that was very active in her community because a number of organizations gathered to pay tribute.  In addition to the organizations and swarms of family, there was also a number of people that she worked with in attendence.    I learned that my mom's cousin's employer was the  urlLink Illinois Department of Human Rights  which is located in the Illinois state capital Springfield.  So my cousin basically commuted from the southside of Chicago and basically lived in a hotel for much of the week.  In addition to her active career and community involvement, my cousin still seemed to always find time for family and friends.  There were numbers of people that stood up and recalled stories of them having a good time with cousin Tonne.  I am glad that I had a chance to attend the funeral because I learned a great number of details about her life.  Unfortunately I didn't learn these things until her passing, but I think this will inspire me to make a better effert to get to know my mother's side of the family a little better than I have in the past.  Getting to know my father's side has never been a problem since we get together at least a couple times a year to celebrate graduations and holidays.  But I need to make a conscious effort to get to know the other side.  I really don't have an excuse for not doing it especially since there is a great number of them that live in Chicago.  Hopefully the next time I get a chance to know a family member on my mother's side it won't be from another funeral.

      Well I finally got a chance to upload some of the photos from the Louisville trip.  Alot more went on in Louisville than what shows in the pictures because we weren't allowed to take photos at the Tyson boxing match or the after parties.  But by now you already know that Tyson got his butt kicked, so there isn't any point to seeing any pictures of that anyways. ;-)  Just to sum it all up we went to the fight, checked out some afterparties till like 4 am, met Evander Holyfield at the Waffle House, toured Louisville, checked out the Louiville Slugger Museum, took a tour of Churchill Downs, and hung out with the locals on the last night.
