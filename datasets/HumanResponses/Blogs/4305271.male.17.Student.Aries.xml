      Well it seems that things are starting to calm down slightly, which is good, i know that things will never go back to the exact way things were before the letter. But the question is was what happend right, or was it one hell of a screw up. One part says it was right, the rest says it was wrong. If i hadnt have done it then what could have happened, i dont know and i dont want to think about it. I came to a decision, a split in the road, to the left was to continue on and just act like i was fine, which i was not, to the right was to do what i did. I knew that i would probably regret it either way and that it was going to cause problems either way, but the choice had to be made. But all that can be done is to live with the choice i made, nothing more and nothing less and not to pretend that what happend did not actually happen. Nobody knows what could have happend if they had made a different choice, and each of thoes not only affects them but it also affects thoes around them indirectly, some for the better and some for the worse. We just have to live with each of the choices we make and hope that in the end everything turns out ok in a fashion.  Well i think that is enough of my just procrastinating for the moment  TJT

      There are thoes things that you just want to say to people, but you dont know how they will re-act to it. You dont know the consequences of what you do, but the real question is what could have happened if you did not do it. You can lose a friend by saying something that is on your head but you could also lose that person by not saying what is on your head. Is it right to lie or bend the truth to a friend just so that you dont hurt them, is that being a friend, or should you tell them if something is really bothering you. Throughout my life i have done many stupid things, from trying to help two people involved in one situation and helping both parties and i ended up causing my self a lot of troubles, and then there is the recent trouble that i caused. I dont know what will become of what has happend but it was a decision between two different and possibly equal regrets, to tell somebody or not to tell somebody, that was a hard decision. I chose to tell somebody and i now see the consequences of doing what i did. But what could have happened if i did not tell the person, what could have happened then. Well that is what is in my head currently   TJT

      Why does life have to be so complicated, yes we can complicate things so much by our selves but things are already so complex. No matter where we go, no matter where we hide thoes issues will always come back. Some people would say that these are all just a test for when we are older, but who knows, it seems they get exponentialy harder as you get older. This seems to be turnig out more like a Online Journal than a Blog but such is life. Well i just hope that slowly things will get back to some resembelance of order, if that is possible, tempers will run high and emotions will run deep but things just seem to always turn out, no matter what. Lets just hope this time it is no different.   TJT

      Yes it has been only minutes since my last blog, but i must say this;  Year 12 Suck Little Hairy Tristan Balls  So much work, so little time, and constantly being told told that the rest of our lives depend on this one year. Then there is all the other stuff ontop of the school work that we all must deal with, friends, family, relationships and our own minds. I think that my mind has to be the worst out of the whole lot, i just cant stop it from going over the same old stuff over and over again.    TJT

      Isnt life always interesting, you just never know where it will lead to next Some would say that i am way tot cautious, but that is me, it is me not taking cautions that scares me, and it is what i have done recently and have cause some problems between people. But is there really a meaning to life, some would say that it is 42 others would say it is to live a long and prosporus life, but who knows
