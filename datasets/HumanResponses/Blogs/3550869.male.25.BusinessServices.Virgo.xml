      I'm not going to go into an entire enormity into how many partying I did over the weekend, mainly because I can't fill all the details, but I should state that I've not done so much partying in my life. Bring it all on again!  Friday night was the first night. Having nursed my sore head following England's disappointing defeat, I slept the day away, and took up an invitation to a evening with Teddy, Rui and Jonathan who were throwing a party for their respective banks. Reputedly 120 bankers from 4 banks in one room. Plus a few other non-bankers, strangers and a clearly out-of-place management consultant or two in the mix as well. 120 bankers in the same room - not often that happens! Anyway, after a few(!) drinks, we went of to another club at around 1am and danced the night away - well most of it, as some people had to return to the office the next morning. I love being on holiday to see this!  Saturday, for me though, was a trip to Shenzhen to meet up with my good old mate, Peter. He managed to choose the best place to meet him, the lobby of the Shangri-La Hotel, and kindly provided me with the pleasure to gawp at a few supermodels who walked in. I noticed I wasn't the only one gawping at the near 6 ft Chinese babes...  But eye-candy aside, there were more physical delectations to enjoy later. First, my first ever visit the driving range to hit a few golf balls. Now, the only golf I've played before was at Blenheim Palace on their miniature putting range (which I must admit I wasn't great at and even Ling had beaten me on the first three holes there), but this time, I was determined to give the ball a real thwack. Not surprisingly, you'd see me miss my first swing. And then the second. But I did manage to hit it the third time, and it was ok. Later after a few more hits, skims and thuds (well, they didn't really go far), I did manage to hit a few fairly sweetly, managing around 130 yds on a 7 iron. Don't know if that's any good or not, but it was a nice feeling.  After swinging a club, it was dinner and then time for swinging IN a club. Well, less swinging but a lot more dancing in a lovely place called Casa de Michelle. Some great music, some cold drinks, some more dancing... It was great evening!  Sunday, though, was a much more relaxed affair. As part of APS's 5th Anniversary celebrations, we borrowed a boat from a bank and put a load of people on it and set sail in the direction of Sai Kung. Most people went for some watersports - from whoo-hoos from Wesley on the banana boat, to a determined, statuesque Rui on the waterskis - but others just enjoyed the scenery and sunbathed. (And some brought their work, Jonathan!).  Sorry to those who weren't able to come along for whichever reason (the most novel excuse award goes to Paloma), but we'll organise something like this again, I'm sure! Thanks to Rui and Marianne for doing a lot of the hard work this weekend too!  And so three parties in 3 days. Not bad, not bad at all... Now for some sleep...

       * Up late for a painful loss *   It's 5.30 here, HK time. England have lost. Heads hung low down at the Champs bar downstairs as England lose 6-5 on penalties.  It's always been hard for me to watch England. I never watch the qualifying games because they usually involve an excrutiating period when England take the lead and you wonder if they can hold on, or they go behind and doubt they can claw it back.  Well, tonight was no different. Three minutes gone, Michael Owen scores. For the next 107 minutes, England defend for their lives. First Postiga scores, then a scorcher from Rui Costa in extra time. England out? No, Lampard saves England, but only for a dreaded penalty competition.  Now if David Seaman was in goal, I'd have a little bit of confidence. David James never got close. Our hero, another David, Sir Beckham misses - his third penalty miss for England in a row. He looked back at the penalty spot and the remains of the cloud of dust that came up when he scuffed the ground. Doesn't matter. He missed.  Rui Costa may have missed, but Darius Vassel's miss was decisive. Ricardo, the Portugal keeper, takes the final penalty. Flies by David James. All over.  5.44am and on Portugese television on cable in my room, there is a carnival going on. It could have been England's carnival. Dawn has broken over Hong Kong. Time to go to bed. Sadly, I can't wake up later thinking this was all *just* a nightmare...

      It's 3 days into my holiday and apologies to those who expect my blog not to be so updated. But I have my trusty laptop with me and about 5 minutes, so why not add to it?    * Stanley and the Dragons *  Well Tuesday was Tuen Ng, or, for the Dragon Boat Festival, which takes places in several places all over Hong Kong (and indeed much of China). The festival I went to was the Stanley Dragon Boat Festival, a place more renowned for its fantastic market rather than a very large bunch of corporates descending on the town to participate in furious paddling for a minute and a half, all throughout the day!  Anyway, my role was to simply watch and sample the lovely corporate hospitality on board some luxury yachts that all the corporate big guns seem to have. Moreover, they're all tied together, so in a unwritten gentleman's rule, one can hop between each of them and say hello (and do lots more) to mates in other boats. Or you could just keep going until you reach the end.  Of course, some boats had a much more party-like atmosphere than other. The UBS boat had Senegalese drummers beating a tune, whilst next door, on a boat where they shouted Liechtenstein out every 5 minutes (I still haven't worked out who they were representing!), they had a pro DJ with some dirty dancers on deck. As the various parties went on, it almost felt like a dream, with so many bikini babes on the various boats. It dawned on me that maybe all those beautiful people you'd expect on my flight over (if the adverts are to be believed) were simply here in Hong Kong in the first place.  One thing though, I didn't bump into lots of (or even any) celebrities (I'm still holding out on bumping into Karena Lam Kar Yan - of Tiramisu, July Rhapsody and Floating Landscape fame - and asking her to marry me at the first opportunity...), but I did bump into lots of friends (even better of course). As well as my host, Teddy, Rui and Paloma were there putting bits of wood to water too, and Janet was also there to watch. And old friends from eras ago popped up (Roy Lam, nice to see you again). All in all, it was a thoroughly enjoyable day, even if it was a little bumped by jet lag and watching England win!    * The Swankiest Visa Section in the World *  As I'm planning to pop over to Shenzhen to see me ol' pal and partner in crime, Peter, I had to get myself a visa at, wait for it, the China Resources Building in Wan Chai. I'm not sure what other resources they have in that building, but I hope they've got enough security looking after the goldmines, oil rigs and the environmental resources in that building. I mean, who knows what is kept safe at the bottom of that building?  Anyway, it was also the nicest Visa Section of any Embassy/Consulate/Delegate I've ever visited. Whilst most places I've seen are basically the basement of any embassy what has second hand furniture that has only been cleaned once since the 1960s when they bought it, The CRB has its visa section on the 7th floor, and it's all brand new. In fact it was more akin to waiting at a new airport.  But even with their advanced electronic ticketing system flashing up numbers of which counter to go to, one thing doesn't change, and that's the queues. I had to wait 2 and a half hours, through which I probably had read every word in my passport a few dozen times.  But I seemed to be one of those people who filled in their forms right because in the end (apart for a 30 second dash to make a photocopy, I was in and out in a minute. But I got my visa all right, so that's just fine!    * Chilled, on the Rocks *  Now today was supposed to be one of my two days of chilling, so I started off by going shopping as soon as I had finished trying to get my visa. I also had thought about seeing a HK film, but too my disappointment, not many are on. Super Model was one that's on (featuring the lovely Karena... yum), but it's not the type of film I felt like seeing. Oh well, I'll see it soon on DVD anyway.  So instead, I decided to grab myself some DVDs and watched Love On The Rocks (Louis Koo, Gigi Leung). Unfortunately, it wasn't the greatest movie in the World, in fact it doesn't even come close to average. And that's coming from a guy who wants to marry Gigi if he bumps into her, but won't because Ekin's got her and Karena's got my attention now...  Anyway, Thursday is going to be another chilled day, followed by some partying on Friday. Can't wait!

      Well, England has just won its match against Croatia in Euro 2004 by a 4-2 margin. It's currently 4.45am in the morning out here, but I'm glad I woke up to watch the match down at the Champs bar in the basement of my hotel. And my fantasy football team didn't do too badly this evening...  My flight to HK wasn't very eventful (some might say thankfully). I flew with an airline whose advert for 'Upper Class' showed ugly people getting on the plane and  beautiful people getting off. Well my first impression when waiting in the departure lounge with my fellow passengers was certainly that I hoped the adverts were true...  But anyway, it was one of the most pleasant flights I've taken, especially with 'V's  entertainment on demand. A chance to see The Last Samurai in amongst the sleepless attempts at sleep was certainly one of my highlights.  Anyway, after landing and meeting up with Teddy, I'm now happy at 5am in the morning that my team won. And that Paul Scholes scored. And that Thierry Henry scored twice. My fantasy football team is in dreamland...

      Well, this is my first post on Blogger. Whilst I have my own website ( urlLink http://www.lestmak.com/ ), this will now be the main store for my blogs, as it is a little easier to update than my own website. Nonetheless, I'll be continually updating my main site once in a while and I'll make sure you hear about it here. But in the meantime a few comments:   Today marks the 5th anniversary of the founding of the Oxford University Asia-Pacific Society, and that is the reason for my impending departure to Hong Kong. As well as meeting up with some old mates, some of whom I've missed for the last 3 years, I'm looking forward to catching up with most of them. But the APS 5th Anniversary Boat Party in Hong Kong Harbour will be the epitome of the celebrations. I look forward to it!  However, going to Hong Kong does put me in a slightly awkward position. With Euro 2004 happening right now, I'm going to either stay up late or miss England's matches altogether. Mind you, if England do make the quarter-finals, I will join the ex-pats in the bars and cheering my team on. Of course.  But it will be a fun packed 10 days out there. I plan to see friends paddling away in the Dragonboat Festival (22 June), and catch up on some HK movies. Ah, the fun!

       It's a long way to Niagara Falls and back to Boston, you know. A map told me it was around 462 miles to Buffalo, the nearest city to the Falls&nbsp;that's still on the US side. But we thought we'd try to go anyway. So on a Friday afternoon (thanks to L.E.K.'s summer hours in the US), Annie, Elaine (a friend of Annie's) and I set off on the long drive ahead to Buffalo...    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   * OFF TO SEE A BUFFALO *       &nbsp;  Now I've never driven on the right had side of the road. Nor had I driven a car larger than a small hatchback, but this time, I had the chance to drive a beige Chevvie across two US states. Tricky at first (I couldn't really feel how fast the car was accelerating and more worrying, how fast it was under braking), I managed to drive down to Buffalo without too many mishaps. Except we got lost on the way in Albany. Twice.    &nbsp;  After some extra speed (I admit, I did surpass expectations, if you know what I mean...), we did make it into Buffalo, or rather its suburbs late, at night. An early morning rise come about as we seek what we came a long long way for.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   * NIAGARA FALLS *     &nbsp;  The falls are one of the most amazing sights one would ever see. Sitting on the River Niagara and straddling between US and Canada, the falls are actuually two. The American Falls are more of a traditional straight edge waterfall, whilst the Horseshoe Falls are as the name suggests and curved. Due to the shape of the falls (which are probably around 240 degrees around a circle, the water falls down and a mass of mist arises from the pool below, to a height probably around 20 feet above the top of the falls.    &nbsp;  A series of boats&nbsp;( The Maid of The Mist ) go down to the base of each of the falls, taking tourists and soaking them. But if that wasn't enough wetting, the  Cave of the Winds  allows you to travel by elevator to the base of the American Falls. Four platforms can be climbed, the third of which is called  The Hurricane  and an apt name it is too. You get totally drenched!    &nbsp;  The American Falls are a fantastic sight at night, but the Horseshoe Falls are more of a disappointment, mainly because the mist obscures much of what you can see of the falls.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   * WHERE HAVE ALL THE BUFFALOS GONE? *     &nbsp;  In the middle of our day and night visits to the Falls, we decided to go into Buffalo for some Buffalo wings, of course. Having made it into Buffalo, though, it was very much a ghost town. Barely a soul was in sight, no shops were open, and we had to travel a little further uptown to find a bar serving the said wings.    &nbsp;  But it was amazing that the town could be so empty. Where do all the kids and teenagers go? One person suggested we go to the Galleria Mall close to our hotel, which we did, but still not many people were there? So what do Buffalos do on a weekend?    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   * ANNIE'S WEDDING LOCATION *     &nbsp;  Annie's found her wedding location. Our journey back from Buffalo was a more relaxed affair. Taking a detour from the I-90 highway, we decided to take US route 20 to visit the Finger Lakes. Our first stop was at Canandaigua, a little town on the edge of the lake of the same name. A beautiful lakeshore greets you with gazebo that reaches out into the water. Now Annie has picked a place, all she has to do is get married!    The rest of our journey took us through the Finger Lakes region and a few extra sights to see. It was a very good trip and the 1,050 miles were worth it. Not a bad weekend at all!    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       Well, it's now a week since I've been in Boston and I have to say, it's all been great so far. Well, except for the weather for the most part of the week, although I have been informed by my pod back home in L.E.K.'s London office that I&nbsp;  didn't  bring the weather with me to London as it's still there, and just as gloomy as I left it. Well the weather here in Boston has been fairly cool and wet, except for Saturday, when it turned out to be pleasant, fortunately...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;    * A VISIT TO ROCKPORT *      It was on Saturday that I went out to visit Rockport, a town about an hour's train ride outside of Boston. Situated on the coast and part of Cape Ann, it is one of the most picturesque seaside towns you'd ever come across. Not only for its beaches, but it has become a centre for artists and there are literally scores of art galleries and shops on the various streets there.    It is also a very photogenic place, which is why, I guess, artists love the place. There's a very well used harbour, and boats coming in and out all day. Unfortunately, though, despite my best attempts, I feel my own photos didn't come out as I expected them to. But a learning process anyway...    I also popped down to Gloucester when I had run out of things to do in Rockport. Gloucester is famous for the setting of the true story of  The Perfect Storm , made famous by the film starring George Clooney (a dire film in my own opinion, I might add). The list of names of those that died are listed in the Town Hall, although I didn't have a chance to see it.    There isn't much to see in Gloucester, to be honest, but the Maritime Heritage Museum on the coast is a great place to go. There, they demonstrate and actually build and maintain boats and you can see how they do it.      * KRISTINA'S PARTY*     On my return from Rockport and Gloucester, I joined Kristina, a colleague, and her chums for a belated birthday party (well, that was the excuse, anyway). As well as grooving to a few cheesy songs (I remember ABBA's Dancing Queen some time during the music), we proceeded to an Irish pub somewhere in Boston to dance away the night. It was good fun. Thanks Kristina!     &nbsp;    * ANOTHER WEEK AHEAD *   Well, Week 2 of 5 coming up. And some endurance will be needed at the end of it! Anyway, I'll say&nbsp;more next time I write...   &nbsp;

      It’s the end of my first working day in Boston, and it feels very different to what things were like in London. My commute is 5 minutes instead of 50, I have a view to die for from the 16th floor of a skyscraper, and I have Quincy Market, one of my most favourite places in the world at my doorstep...  It’s been great so far. A chance to meet up with Annie when I arrived, it almost seemed a little surreal that only 4 months or so ago, we were both still in London. Even more so was Sunday and a lunch with Pak Wing. And I must say, he hasn’t changed a bit. At least not his accent! Sunday evening, though, was the highlight of my stay so far. The Commonwealth Shakespeare Company put on a free production of Much Ado About Nothing on at the Boston Common. It was a marvellous performance and I enjoyed it very much. Only odd thing was the American accent in a Shakespeare play. Certainly not what I expected.  But today the rains have started to fall and it looks like I’ve brought the London weather with me. Oh well, you can’t win all the time. Anyway, two working days gone and just the remainder of 5 weeks to go. I’ve enjoyed it so far...

      Imagine my surprise. I get home from my holiday to see an e-mail from Helen, our allocations manager in the office. Call up, find out they'd like to send me to Boston for a month to work on a case. Didn't take me long to say yes!  So I'm off to Boston this coming weekend. Superb! Can't wait. So from seeing long lost friends in HK, I'm off to see more long lost friends out west! Pak Wing and Annie, I'm coming your way!  Anyway, must keep my excitement in check... :)

      I'm back home. And missing Hong Kong and Shenzhen already. I wanna go back...    * WHAT WAS IN GUANGZHOU? *   Tuesday saw me visit Guangzhou with Peter Wu, who assures me that the trains in China run on time. Well, maybe it's the L.E.K. blood in me (L.E.K. works a lot on railway projects in the UK, don't we, Alison? :P), but our train out from Shenzhen to Guangzhou ran slowly with delays. Nonetheless, once we arrived in Guangzhou, Peter treated me to another surprise - McDonald's!  Now, it had been installed on me by Lou, my tour guide with Contiki on my European tour with Ling three years ago, that we weren't to ever visit the home of "Satan's Clown" whilst on holiday, except to use the facilities (because they're free!), so I was shocked. But I had deprived Peter of his breakfast that morning with the early rise (though bear in mind I had to get up earlier than him to get to Shenzhen in the first place!), and you can't deprive a FAF of his breakfast. (FAF = Fat African / American Flatmate, the affectionate names he and his flatmate, Nick, give each other...). Anyway, not to be tempted into a burger, I settled for a 2 kwai ice cream!  It was a sweltering day in Guangzhou reaching 35C with unbearable humidity, and I honestly can't remember too much of where we visited! We had visited a shrine, a burial ground, archaeological digs on Beijing Lu and Sun Yat Sen's memorial (although we didn't go in), but it was simply too hot. By mid-afternoon, we had decided to go to the China Hotel By Marriott, supposedly the poshest hotel Guangzhou has to offer, and I sat there drinking a Pimms No. 1 in their lounge, as one must on a hot day...  By late afternoon, we had given up and decided to go back to Shenzhen. Then it struck. Our train was delayed and left Guangzhou half an hour late... China's trains run on time? I don't believe it! Or was it me? Can't be, never worked on a rail case in my life (fingers crossed, I don't!).    * PLEASE DANCE, BUT PLEASE DON'T SING! *   After reaching Shenzhen, and dinner in the best Japanese noodle chain of restaurants in the world (Ajisen Ramen), Sunny and Lin joined us to go down to V-Bar at Shenzhen's poshest hotel, the Crowne Plaza. The impression going in was "Great! There's live music!", followed by a "Uh-oh...", followed by a "Please stop singing!". A band had been brought in to sing cheesy classics, all of them dressed in orange boiler suits, and singing very flat. A thought did cross my mind that they should have returned to Guantanamo Bay... I think our dear own Sunny should have taken over and wow-ed the crowd.  Nonetheless, their dancing was all right. And Sunny and I continued where as we did last Saturday, adding our own moves on the dancefloor.  We finally caved in after midnight though. A tired Peter, dreadful singing and Absolut-ly ginned, we all went home singing along to Sunny's Whitney Houston's Greatest Hits CD in the car...  The next morning, it was a lie in, before Sunny invited Peter and me off to the Raindrop Café for some false Western food... Well, it was meant to be Western style, but just like many of our Chinese imitations in the UK (not my dad's of course!), it's always inferior! Anyway, I think I foolishly accepted an oyster, which I'm still feeling the effects of a few days later!  I was sorry to leave Shenzhen in the afternoon, particularly as I had so much fun there that I hadn't expected! Sunny, Lin, Stephanie and of course Peter had made it into a fun place for me, and to them, I'm very grateful.  On my return to Hong Kong, I finally caught up with Peter Pulsford in the Post-1997 restaurant. Great place, and a bit more food of home, except this time, it was a little more authentic! Hope all is well Peter!    * FINAL DAY *   On my final day in Hong Kong, an early morning to pack up my suitcase (surprisingly still very light), and had lunch with Jonathan and Jennifer. After a bit of shopping afterwards with Jennifer, I managed to bump into the demonstrations that are now a part of the 1st July festivities. Some 200,000 people were there to make their views known on a variety of political issues, particularly, direct elections of the Chief Executive, and although crowds were down on last year, it was one of the most amazing sights I've seen of a mass gathering. Thousands of people wearing their white T-shirts and demonstrating peacefully.  It was soon time to say farewell to a country I have come to love to visit. Although I probably could never live there, it is to me a fantastic holiday destination, where my friends live and lots of hustle and bustle. Aptly enough, the last person I saw before going home was Liana, on her way home from a business trip in Taipei, we bumped into each other in the airport. It won't be long before I return again...

       Well, it's almost time to return to the UK after 5 weeks in Boston. I've had tremendous fun here. Thanks so much to everyone at L.E.K. Boston for making me welcome and for making my stay so enjoyable. Also, thanks of course to Pak Wing and Annie, fellow "Londoners" here in Boston.      Next stop will be a short stop in London, but I'm being dispatched to Dover on Monday morning. Not ideal, but maybe some more exciting things to come!

       It was the last of my four weekends in New England, and my hub and spoke tour of the region, it was finally the long overdue trip to Cape Cod. Here's a brief overview of the outing...     * Jamie *   The train ride out of South Station wasn't extraordinary. Annie and I had made the train as expected and chugged along the commuter rail out to Kingston. A couple of quick games of Chess later (Annie's new past time), a win for me and a polite concession to her, we made it to the station in the middle of nowhere.  Or so we were told. But that wasn't a problem. Annie had met a local resident, Jamie, a few months ago on the Cape, and she had kindly let us stay with her on this trip. Jamie grew up on the Cape as a child, but had spent 40 years teaching first graders in various parts of the world including Fiji, the West Indies, but mostly in Hartford in Conneticut. Now retired to the Cape again, she had plenty of stories to tell over the years, which provided much interest for Annie and me over the weekend.       Jamie now lives in Sandwich, a smallish town just on the Cape and would be our base camp for the two days ahead.        * Beaches and P-town *    Cape Cod has some very beautiful beaches and we visited a few on the east coast of the Cape. A national park designated by John F Kennedy, the arm of the Cape is effectively a series of sand dunes, and therefore is a very fragile landscape. It amazed me how much conservation goes on, and looking around, there is a lot of green foliage, much of it is clearly artificially planted (plants that would not have grown in that environment) to prevent the dunes simply blowing away.  It was also quite poignant for me that we went to Marconi Beach. Slightly away from the beach, Guglielmo Marconi had planned to receive the first wireless message from across the Atlantic to Cornwall, UK to this point. However, he decided to receive the signal in Newfoundland instead, but Cape Cod still has the communication station he built and named the beach after him  The Cape has a series of beaches running on the east coast up towards Provincetown. Probably the gay capital of the US, Provincetown is eclectic, vibrant and fun-loving. Very much touristy (much like the rest of the cape), theatre, music and performing artists do their best to draw you to their stages and artists try their best to get you to bring your eyes into their galleries (and your wallets too, of course).      But whilst this wouldn't really be the best town for your kids, it is a playground for the grown-ups. Cosmopolitan in it's very nature - flags for dozens of nations fly on the buildings, not to mention many rainbow flags - it is welcoming for everyone and it simply feels like a town that knows how to enjoy itself without over-exertion.          * Martha's Vineyard *    There is a little island to the south-west of the Cape called Martha's Vineyard (or MV). Arriving in Oak Bluffs, on the north-east shore, it's reknowned for its historic gingerbread houses. The houses orginiate to a camp that was built every summer for teaching Christianity, but eventually instead of building tents every year, houses did the job instead. Each of the houses are uniquely and elaborately decorated, with current owners having the obligation to maintain their appearance. Ultimately, this means that the houses make up an idyllic model village, only they're real size and people live in them.      Edgartown, on the east coast, is MV's Capital. Whilst I have to admit that there isn't that much else to see there than the norm, several America's Cup boats had sailed into port and were taking part in some races. I have to admit, sailing is beginning to grab more of an interest for me and maybe I might take it up one day!          * Sunset Sandwich *       Before the final departure from the Cape, one last chance to see a sunset in Sandwich. A trip to the Boardwalk, a bridge on salt marshes in Sandwich harbour, and a couple of photos later, I had the photos of my trip.      A quick dinner and a rush to Kingston to catch the last train, it had turned out to be a beautiful weekend.                 Links:    urlLink  http://www.capecod.com/       Photos will appear in due course

       Time’s running out for me in Boston – My return is imminent and I only have 10 days left to enjoy here    * VERMONT *   Every L.E.K. office has a Summer event and having missed my London one, I had the chance to go to Boston’s outing to Manchester, VT. It is, however, hardly like Manchester, England, a picturesque town at the base of a very tall hill (can’t really call it a mountain). It does, however, have lots of shops like Manchester, as it’s an outlet city as well.  Our stay was in the Equinox, one of the ‘resorts’ in Manchester. A large luxurious hotel, it had every activity you could imagine, and as soon as I arrived, I had pretty much made the decision that I was going to mountain bike around for an hour.  It had been some four years now since I mountain biked off-road, and probably even then, it’s once or twice in six years since I was in Brittany with Nick Folkard and SPS. It therefore turned into a bit of a challenge. After the first 10 minutes, I had obviously outpaced myself on the uphill stretch and was completely exhausted and breathless. Fortunately, I had stumbled upon a gorgeous lake, and a few minutes rest was definitely worthwhile. The remainder of the ride, though, was still very tricky, but I managed it. And I had still the sore bottom yesterday to prove it.  The evening was a dinner at the hotel in a big tent they called the Taconic. Now, I’d managed to survive without mosquito bites in my 10 days in Hong Kong, but I wasn’t so lucky this night. I have been bitten although they’re not as nasty as I’ve experienced. But ooh, the itch!    * DRIVING NOT A CHELSEA TRACTOR *   Monday was activity day, and mine was an off-road driving experience. I didn’t get one of the Hummers, but I did get a Land Rover Discovery to tackle one a fairly fun course. I’d never driven a Chelsea Tractor before (so called in London because 4x4s are more common in the posh Chelsea part of the city than off road!), but at least I can claim my first time really was off-road. I managed to learn some tricks (left foot braking for example), and I have to say, it all did feel natural to me!    * FEW DAYS LEFT *   There are only a few days left and one weekend to go. And I’ve probably saved the best to last as I plan to go to Cape Cod. I’ve certainly been waiting to go for a very long time. I’m very much looking forward to it.
