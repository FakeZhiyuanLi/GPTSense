						   Dear Void,  This does not bode well.  It's 2:15 and I have approximately 200 pages to read.  I started at about noon while Murphy was in the shower and got a few pages read.  That was fine.  Then he got out of the shower and didn't have to go into work until 1:45 because he had some OT to cut....so that knocked an hour and fifteen out of my reading schedule.  And then Angel was incredibly restless so we just went for a very brief walk in the park...enough to get her heated up and ready to sack out on the nice cold tile for a nap.  So now I've eliminated as many distractions as possible and HOPEFULLY when I pick up my giganto book on psychopathology, I'll be able to buckle down and read with some considerable speed.  I hope.  I finally broke down and bought some reading glasses to combat the itty bitty print.  Makes me feel old, though fellow grad students have informed me that they've had to do the same thing.  Trying to save my eyes from getting monumentally worse from all the reading.   Poor Angel is miserable here and Murphy's depressed because she's depressed.  He misses the puppies something awful but he said not to bring either one again because there's no yard and neither of them like being cooped up inside.  She's a big distraction to me as well...keeps on climbing up in my lap.  Lord I hope I can get back into the groove of things.  I need to go read while she's napping and knock out these two chapters in psychopathology.  I promised her we'd go back to the park for another lap when I did.   Yours, Maggie

						   Dear Void,  Well the first day went pretty well I suppose.  The going over of syllabi was somewhat more lengthy than in undergrad but still, we didn't do a whole lot in either class and got out early from Stats (thank God, as I had to go to Walmart for school supplies and snacks).  The last fifteen minutes of stats was spent with my professor reeling off formulas that we'd need for our homework assignment and me thinking "OH MY GOD!" as I haven't been in a stats class in five years.  However, when I sat down with it last night it began sort of vaguely coming back to me, so I think it's not completely lost in the annals of my recently underworked brain.  So far I've got about 150 pages to read and one more class to attend today.  Intelligence Testing at 12:30.  So far my profs seem nice.  Armstrong is generally perky and seems like a fun loving sort of guy.  Geisen...well, he's got more personality than Ben Stein...but not much.  He seems nice though, despite the flaw of apparently loving all math related courses of study.   I had fits yesterday trying to log in to whatever the university's system is to access some of my readings.  The damn thing wouldn't take my password AGAIN.  I finally got it changed this morning to something that's a bit easier to remember.  Fewer numbers.   This morning I've been creating charts in Excel for an expansion of an old report for my boss.  Our undergrad assistant will plug the actual numbers in...once I've run them on SPSS of course. Which I must do shortly.  But I felt the urge to write here whilst I had the opportunity.   Murphy has evidently lost 12 pounds, though on a man as big and tall as he, much of it is probably water weight from actually not eating junk every day.  Damn him.  I, naturally, have lost nothing and am retaining water like a sponge or something to that effect.  I keep forgetting to buy my apple cider vinegar tablets, as they didn't have them when I went last week.  As of Monday I'm going to start trying to squeeze  workouts in my weekly routine.  And hopefully my MIL will walk with me a few nights a week.  She and I have such an odd, but good relationship.  It's really a blessing.  Especially when I hear all the tales of terrible in-laws from my various other married friends.  I'm going to start phase 1 of Southbeach seriously again today.  So far I've had my tea and a handful of peanuts.  I have some string cheese in my bag for whenever I get hungry later and when I get back from class at 2:30 I've got some low carb cup of soup that should tide me over until I get home this evening.  I bought all sorts of stuff at the grocery last night for this phase...lots of veggies, shrimp, fish, and a few other things.  This is my last weird week before settling into a true schedule.  I'll work the rest of today after class and then in the morning I'm having my phone line installed and coming in for the last 2 and a half hours I need for the week.   Then to Oxford to see Murphy.  Oh wait...I already worked my other four hours on Tuesday.  So I don't have to work on Friday...or this afternoon.    Sweet.  I can go ahead and get a jumpstart on my reading.  Probably psychopathology first.   Must work...  Yours, Maggie

						   Dear Void,  I think it is quite possible that the administration here at MSU is worse than that at my home university.  Having not yet falling completely back into student mode and operating under the (mistaken) impression that yesterday's academic errands wouldn't take too many stops or too much time, I wore a pair of exceedingly impractical (but cute) shoes.  FIRST I had to go to Allen Hall, where I was told I could pick up an Enrollment Agreement (whatever that was) from Admissions.  Got there only to find out that Admissions had been moved to Montgomery Hall (which has no sign as it's only recently had renovations completed).  Hung out there for a while waiting for my Enrollment Agreement and then had to go BACK to Allen Hall to get my ID photo made (it was horrible of course, though not the worst I've ever had).  From there I had to hike across campus to the Student Health Center to show them my proof of immunization so that I could register.  From THERE I had to hike in the opposite direction toward Magruder Hall (the psych building) to meet with my advisor, which wasn't a particularly fruitful meeting other than actually getting ahold of my pin number so that I could access the online registration stuff.  I already knew what classes, what section and what times I'd be meeting and had already pre-ordered books accordingly.  I did ask Dr. Spirrison about the success rate among those completing the program getting into PhD programs and he confirmed my suspicions that many of those unsuccessful in recent years did not have nearly the undergrad GPA or GRE scores that I have.  Provided that I do well in all my classes here, I shouldn't have any problems getting in somewhere.  From his office I walked a few blocks down to the Union bookstore to pick up my books (they didn't have two of them), then back to my car.  Drove a huge loop around campus looking again for a parking space near the union because I thought I'd been mischarged for a book.  Turns out the receipt was just hard to read.  THEN I had to drive all the way to the Colliseum to get my parking decal.  But first evidently I had to register my vehicle online, which was a pain in the ass as the system wasn't set up for me yet and I had to get OUT of line to find help and then wait in line AGAIN only to have it not like the password I picked.  Since when is my last name in the dictionary?  The old white guy that was helping me asked what my first name was.  "Courtney" I replied.  (Incidentally my student ID was sitting right under his nose).  "Q?"  I gave him a look that questioned his ability to hear.  "No, it's Courtney."  "Q?"  "No, it's C."  "Q?"  "C!"  What kind of dumbass looks at a petite little white chick and thinks Courtney is spelled with a Q?  No matter that I don't actually GO by my first name.  By the time I finally got my decal and headed home I was exceedingly annoyed and excessively put out by everyone's idiocy.  I finally was able to get registered.  Geez.  Today at work has gone pretty well.  I think the ice has finally been broken with my office mate.  She was (for her) positively chatty this morning.  She actually shared some personal information.  I jumped at the opening.  Maybe the next few months won't be so bad after all.  Once she opens up she's got a wicked dry sense of humor.   Tonight is girl's night.  Marion and I are providing chick flicks and some sort of food for our friend (really Marion's friend and my acquaintance, but she seems nice) Anna, who recently wed her longtime boyfriend because he was being sent to Iraq.  They had all of two weeks together before he got shipped off to Camp Shelby for training or whatever.  I don't think he leaves the country for another few months.  But in any case, Anna is missing him like crazy and is totally disconsolate.  Marion and I both had our reservations about the wisdom of marrying before a year or more separation.  But c'est la vie.  'tis done.  Back to work...  Yours, Maggie

						   Dear Void,  I hate Mondays.  Really and truly.  Have I mentioned that before?  Not only did I suffer the monumental insult of being woken BEFORE my alarm went off by my husband's snoring...not only am I having a TOTALLY wonky hair day on a day I have to get an ID picture made (naturally)...not ONLY did I have to perform the odious task of ironing this morning...BUT I BURNED MY FREAKING HAND ON THE FRIGGING STEAM FROM MY TEA KETTLE!  And it's a nasty red whelp now.  This was largely accomplished because I wasn't good and awake and couldn't see in the kitchen which was lit only by the early morning light.   Things have improved somewhat since I got to work (like the fact that I'm finished here at noon).   Went to Little Rock this past weekend to hear Evanescence, Seether, Breaking Benjamins and 3 Days Grace.  It was an awesome concert (though I don't care for 3 Days Grace).  Amy Lee is shaped like a good solid NORMAL girl.  Praise God.  A famous female of normal proportions rather than the prepubescent boys the fashion industry would have us believe is normal.  I couldn't believe that Evanescence called Little Rock home.  That a band like that came out of a place THAT conservative.   I can't wait for their next album to come out.  Damn that girl has a set of pipes.  The only real downsides to the concert was that we had floor seats, which meant no seats, which meant that everybody and their brother was TALLER THAN ME and Murphy kept having to lift me up so I could see my favorite songs.  I have requested seats on the sides in the terraced section so I can see over tall people for the next concert we go to (whenever that may be).  The other problem was all the jack ass smokers who brought in cigarettes and lit up despite the fact that it was a non smoking arena.  The weed was actually more prevalent than regular cigarettes.  I had a nasty headache after.  I managed NOT to fly into a berserker rage and start kicking and punching and yelling at them to "put out their goddamned offensive fucking cigarettes".  But it was a near thing.  Probably a good thing I'm not a large, lethally trained man like Murphy.   Trying without success to get enthused about the strawberry yogurt at my elbow.  I think I'd just rather not eat.   School starts on Wednesday and I'm looking forward to it.  Did a bit of shopping last week and have augmented my summer wardrobe (a necessary expedient since I haven't actually bought summer clothes other than a shirt here and there in the last 3 years because I loathe the fashions) with a few new pair of jeans and several shirts.   Been pondering a plot for one of my novels that's in the germinating phase.  There's a character whom I don't like who keeps popping up and I think I shall have to use him, despite the fact that I don't want to.  That happens sometimes in my work...a character pops up and ruins my nice neat organized plot, and I have to find a way to use it because they won't go away...like that annoying hanger on of the popular crowd (make no mistake, I was never either...I was the loner geek who never got invited to all the wild parties when I was younger...).   Guess that's all the news from the sticks.  Much to to today: register for classes, pick up books, student ID, parking decal, air up bike tires.  Same old hassles as undergrad.   Yours, Maggie

						   Dear Void,  I find myself often of late (but I suppose no more often than has been the case since I moved back to the States in 2001) on a kick of listening to bagpipes and Scottish and Irish music.  I've been downloading David Gray, Christy Moore, and various piper corps to listen to in the background between my omnipresent jazz.  I do this several times a year when varying waves of homesickness hit.  That sounds strange, I would imagine, to anyone who hasn't experienced it.  But home is not the place of my birth where I was raised.  Home is Edinburgh and Scotland and the craggy beauty of the Highlands.  I wasna there long in the grand scheme of things, but I swear it got into my blood.  Or my ancestral roots were wakened there.  The call of my soul found echo there and I've never been the same since.  I speak often of moving back to Scotland someday, as this is a desire held deeply in my heart.  And depending upon his mood and whether he wants to humour me or not, my husband Murphy says that we shall when we can afford it.  But I know my husband.  He is a true homebody.  He gets upset at the prospect of leaving the state, let alone the country, no matter how much he enjoyed visiting me when I lived in Edinburgh.  Unless we miraculously end up filthy rich so that we can afford all the transatlantic flights home to visit family, I know he'll never do it.  At least not before his parents pass.  And as that is a long while coming (and certainly not a wished for occurence!)  I shall have to feed my homesickness with books and music and pictures and my writing.  But someday...SOMEDAY, I shall live there again.  And I shan't feel out of my skin all the time, as I do now.    Sassenach  is Gaelic for an outlander or foreigner and that's what I feel where I'm supposed to be at home.  Strange, is it no?  When I came back from living there, I hadna so much picked up the accent as the inflections and slang.  People kept looking at me strange here, knowing that how I was speaking was somehow  off  but unable to pin down exactly why.  And of course everyone thought I was a loon for saying "Cheers." all the time, which means "Thanks and goodbye" over there.   Every now and again, that way of speaking will pop back out of my mouth without my thinking.  Particularly if I've been watching a movie or something with accurate accents.  Or listening to a well read book on tape, as I am now.  Diana Gaboldon's  Outlander  (which is likely why I've got it on my mind).  It's a fantastic book, whether interested in Scotland or not.  I highly recommend all of her work.   Back to the grindstone I suppose.  Yours, Maggie

						   Dear Void,  I really hate shared office space.  It's not that I have anything particularly against my current office mate or even previous ones.  But it would simply be nice to have a space to myself in which to work.  We're consistently bumping chair backs, as the space isn't big enough for the both of us.  This will soon be rectified as we'll be changing spaces soon (thank God).   But not soon enough.  Of course it doesn't help to feel that my current officemate doesn't particularly like me...she's one of those people with an extremely dry sense of humor and a deadpan personality such that you really don't know what she really thinks.   She gets really defensive about some stuff (Stephen King, being a Republican...), and somehow always seems disapproving of me.  Not that I can come up with any reason WHY she should disapprove of me.  I'll just chalk it up to the fact she doesn't really know me all that well, nor I her.   Spent a long time in my boss's office this morning going over my project for the morning.  He can't seem to find a happy medium between treating me as completely ignorant of statistical methods (I'm not) and completely versed.  I know I've been out for a while, but I'm not competely stupid.  I'm looking forward to classes starting so that I can prove myself.   Had a fabulous visit over tea and a piece of shared cheesecake last night with my friend Marion.  She's one of those people with whom it's almost impossible to break off a conversation.  We really enjoy each other's company.  We were just getting to really know each other before I moved last October and sometimes I wonder if she's one of the reasons I was meant to move back.  I go off on these kicks where I absolutely HAVE to believe that everything happens for a reason.  Probably because my life these last few years has been so chaotic.   Okay, okay...I really must get to the number crunching.  I've finished my cuppa soup (chicken noodle soup...what a breakfast...it was the only thing in my drawer to eat) and need to get going.  Yours, Maggie  P.S. Marion made a rather brilliant (well obvious but brilliant because it never occurred to me) suggestion on how I could still have my afternoon tea at work (the problem being that the coffee club here evidently all drink their coffee black so no sugar or milk available).  Powdered milk!  Once she said it, I was like  DUH!  Of course!  So I bought some last night and as of approximately 3:30 this afternoon hope to be enjoying a cuppa Irish Breakfast Tea.  I'll have to bring my afternoon teas another day.

						    Dear Void,  In an attempt to locate a blog site with all the features I want, I'm beginning yet another blog. I believe this is number 5? Some of my previous moves were intended to avoid those who actually know me face to face...or more particularly a close friend who read my blog with religious ferver and with whom I never had anything to talk about for that reason! She always already knew my news! How annoying. And then she got mad at ME for not having anything to say when we talked! Of all the bloody cheek! I have also learned that it is useful to NOT use real names to refer to people in one's blog, as they can frequently be misinterpreted (lack of vocal tone and all that). Not that I expect anyone to track me down here and actually pick ME out of the thousands of other journalers unless I intend for them to. I simply enjoy putting my thoughts out into the void for other anonymous souls to read and enjoy should they so choose.    My screenname originates from my favorite season of the year, my comfor time, and from "adytum", which is a new word I've discovered that aptly captures the feeling I have toward journaling.  It means "the innermost sanctum of an ancient temple whence oracles were given."  So welcome to my innermost sanctum.  Yours, Maggie
