      A reader asked me whether Elvis Costello is advanced. I believe that he is. He started out on the punk scene, though he never really thought of himself as a punk. As I remember, he was a computer programmer in the early '70s, which just shows you how ahead of his time he was. I think he was also in a country band around that time as well. I love the fact that he chose Elvis as his stage name--and got away with it. I can't think of anything more audacious than taking the King of Rock'n'Roll's name. He didn't choose Jerry Lee Costello or Ringo Costello (and Lou was obviously out), he chose Elvis. "My Aim Is True" is indisputably (and overtly) great. What I love is that his backup band was the same one that backed up Huey Lewis as The News ("Sports" is an all-time advanced album title), and that band could have kicked the Clash's asses any day. Some early evidence of his advancement was his lifting an Abba piano riff for "Oliver's Army" and admitting it openly. He made a country record with a bigtime Nashville producer. He wrote songs with Paul McCartney. Things took a very advanced turn when Costello recorded with the Brodsky Quartet, creating a genuine "song cycle." His collaboration with Burt Bacharach was also a good advanced move. He appeared in an Austin Powers movie, as well as an episode of the Simpsons. One one tour, according to All Music, "he began singing the last song with a microphone, forcing the audience to sit in complete silence as he usually performed 'Couldn't Call It Unexpected #4' with nothing but his dulcet baritone filling the auditorium." Forcing an audience to do anything is advanced, but it's especially advanced if they do it. He did a pop standards album. He grew a long beard and started wearing sunglasses (changing the traditional formula from dark sunglasses, long hair in the back, to dark sunglasses, long hair in the front). Advanced British artists do not wear black leather jackets for some reason. Apparently he also had a residency at UCLA. Recently there was an article about how he has destroyed his wife's music and she his. That's the kind of criticism one would expect of an advanced artist.   So Elvis Costello is a perfect example of an advanced artist. He started out in the Punk scene and wound up singing to Austin Powers, mystifying just about everyone along the way.   I'll probably say more about him as the days go by.

      I just finished reading  urlLink the NY Times review  of Eric Clapton's concert. In case you were wondering, Eric Clapton is not advanced. He's just boring. But I do appreciate his choice of shoes for the stage.

      The real joy of the advanced theory is that it gives you back your favorite artists. You don't have to succumb to the belief that everybody declines and that eventually you have to say goodbye to your heroes. So here's what you do: Put on one of the "bad" records by one of your favorite artists or bands. But listen to it with the idea that everything that once made you cringe is actually good. Embrace all the things you hated. When I relearned how to listen to "Mistrial," I began by laughing at the fact that Lou Reed would make music like "Don't Hurt a Woman." I had to keep a bit of a distance because I hadn't fully understood its glory. Now I love "Don't Hurt a Woman" as much as "Pale Blue Eyes." True, I don't have the same emotional attachment, but that is because "Pale Blue Eyes" was a big part of my life as a younger man, when I was much more emotional. But that doesn't mean "Don't Hurt a Woman" is worse than "Pale Blue Eyes." So put on the record and laugh if you have to. But if you listen to it enough and the music is truly advanced (as opposed to bad), you'll find yourself loving music that you have deprived yourself of unnecessarily.

      from rollingstone.com:  Former Meat Puppets frontman Curt Kirkwood plans to release his first solo album early next year. The currently untitled work features the singer/guitarist backed by the Texas version of the Puppets (guitarist Kyle Ellison, drummer Shandon Sahm, and bassist Andrew DuPlantis) assembled for 2000's Golden Lies, and many of the tracks began as outtakes of that record.  "I went back and listened to [the tracks] and liked them more than the last Meat Puppets record," Kirkwood says. "I didn't want to continue calling it 'Meat Puppets.' It's kind of a hodgepodge of different recordings -- some that I did in my living room -- so I figured I'd better just call it a 'solo record.'"  Among the tracks slated for the record are "Enemy Love Song," "Nursery Rhyme," "I'm Not You" and Golden Lies' aborted title track. "It actually sounds a little more like the old Meat Puppets," Kirkwood says. "[This lineup] likes to play the more straightforward rock."  ----------------------- As you all know, going solo is an advanced thing to do. But what excites me most about this news it that last quote.

      Some background:  When the advanced theory was first created, it was much more about "weirdness" than genius. When you're in high school, you want to show how unique you are by dressing in funny clothes or having a haircut that pisses off your parents. But as you get older, you realize that running shoes are much more comfortable than Doc Martens (in my day) and that interesting hair is exhausting to maintain and stupid besides.  Nothing profound here, but I thought y'all might like to know where all this came from.

      from rollingstone.com:  AEROSMITH guitartist JOE PERRY will make an appearance on the Food Network's Emeril Live on June 27th promoting his hot sauce, "Joe Perry's Rock Your World Boneyard Brew."  --------------------------- Joe Perry doesn't quite meet the standards for being advanced, but I'm always for musicians branching out. Lou Reed should have his own line of cosmetics. He could call the cologne Blue Musk.

      After reading a bit about the advanced theory, one might ask, "What about those artists who start out overt and stay that way?" Well, just because someone doesn't become advanced doesn't mean they aren't good. "Overt" is not a synonym for "bad." But there is a particular type of genius that takes a path that leads to the state of being that we call advanced. These geniuses are those that have been seen with (at some point) long hair in the back, dark sunglasses, and a black leather jacket. They talk a lot about rock'n'roll and make career moves that few people understand. They embrace technology, world music and new artists. They feature their own image on the covers of their albums. They release lots of live records. All others are overt.    -J

      I read a little article about the Cure. While Robert Smith would be a good advanced name, the Cure frontman is not advanced. The evidence? He hates Queen.

      U2 has been flirting with advancement since "Rattle and Hum." But there is an implied wink in a lot of the seemingly advanced things they've done that has held them back from being full-on advanced. I thought the videos for "One" was about Bono's struggle with becoming advanced. As you probably remember, at the time he started to wear a lot of leather and those sunglasses. I believe the first video for the song was a buffalo running in slow motion, which is pretty overt. But there was also a version of them playing in a studio. The version that dealt with advancement was the one with Bono sitting at a table, drinking a beer. He appears to be struggling with his imminent advancement, and in the end he gives in and puts on his dark sunglasses. But he hasn't truly given himself over to advancement. I do like that he talks about taking back the title of greatest rock'n'roll band in the world (celebrating rock'n'roll is very important to an advanced artist). But I'm not sure if he isn't joking just a bit. I *love* that he wears his sunglasses while meeting politicians. It's especially great that he is wearing expensive sunglasses while talking about relieving third-world debt.  When I saw U2 during the Zoo TV tour (advanced), B.A.D. II and Public Enemy opened (advanced combo), there were many signs of advancement. The last song played on the PA before they started was "Rock'n'Roll" by Led Zeppelin and, after they were done, an Elvis (advanced) song played. Best of all, they played "satellite of Love" and Lou Reed appeared onscreen to sing along. That was in the early days of the theory, and it blew my mind. Still, though, there was the whiff of irony, which is for the overt. Another thing I appreciated in their career was when they visited Graceland in "Rattle and Hum." It was a scene straight out of "This Is Spinal Tap."   I'll be curious to see how they progress. Playing the Super Bowl halftime show was a really great move, that's for sure.

      from CNN.com:  Ben Folds is pushing back the release date of his next solo album to early 2005 in order to give "Star Trek" veteran William Shatner's upcoming collection, "Has Been," his full attention. The set is being targeted for a September release by Shout! Factory.  "It is a great record and it is really worth going out and doing some shows in major cities," Folds told Billboard.com. "(Shatner) is not a musician at all -- he's not rapping or singing -- but he is still part of the music. I've never heard a record quite like it." Shatner previously guested on Folds'1998 solo album "Fear of Pop, Vol.1"  Shatner's album was produced and written mostly by Folds and includes cameos by Henry Rollins, Aimee Mann and Joe Jackson, who duets with Shatner on Pulp's "Common People." Author Nick Hornby ("High Fidelity") also co-wrote a song with Folds for the project.  ---------------------- I don't think this really qualifies as advanced, though I applaud the inclusion of Henry Rollins, who just may be advanced. Also, it's sort of interesting that William Shatner and Joe Jackson are doing a Pulp song. I also think that Ben Folds seriously likes the music he has made with Shatner. Still, Ben Folds just doesn't have the stature. It's no Loretta Lynn/Jack White collaboration, that's for sure.  p.s. Ever notice that Aimee Mann and Michael Penn are the man and woman version of each other? I'm glad they got married.

      from rollingstone.com: The Queen musical We Will Rock You will make its American debut at the Paris in Las Vegas, with previews on August 16th and an official premiere in September. The show, which launched in London's West End in 2002, features twenty of the band's hits including "We Are the Champions," "Another One Bites the Dust" and "Crazy Little Thing Called Love." ------------------------- "Movin' Out," Billy Joel's musical, is not advanced because his early work doesn't quite cut it. (He's tried to be advanced for a long time, especially the "We Didn't Start the Fire" phase. He always wore sunglasses in interviews. Still, no dice.) But "We Will Rock You" is certainly advanced. It's always nice when a band continues after their frontman dies. I believe that INXS are finding someone to sing for them through a reality show. That sounds pretty advanced, but INXS wasn't good enough to qualify. Good try, though.  -J

      From Randy Moss, the wide receiver for the Minnesota Vikings:  "The Minnesota Vikings stunned the Denver Broncos with another Randy Moss original on the final play of the first half. The miracle touchdown -- a 44-yard Moss reception followed by an over-the-shoulder, no-look lateral to running back Moe Williams, who took it 15 yards for the score -- didn't just stand as the difference in the Vikings' 28-20 victory; it may end up standing as one of the defining masterpieces of Moss' never-know-what's-next career.  Randy Moss, explaining the play: "It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing that only happens every so often."  (thanks to reader Cubby K)

      I went to the Madonna concert last night at Madison Square Garden. The future Mrs. Wexr has been a fan forever, and her enthusiasm added to my enjoyment. I'll get to the concert review in a moment, but first, a few words about Madonna: She is the only advanced woman artist that I'm familiar with, which isn't to say that aren't more. Actually, Cher is advanced now that I think about it. Highlights would be the blasphemous Pepsi commercial, "Truth or Dare" (advanced artists like movies about tours or themselves in general, Bob Dylan especially--Must talk more about that), and her cover of "American Pie." She has transformed herself many times, which is a hallmark of the advanced artist (Lou Reed, David Bowie, Bob Dylan). She also acts. And she embraces younger artists (Britney Spears) and incorporates "what's happening now" (like the vocoder she uses in so much of the new stuff) in her music. But let's talk about the concert.  Before the show began, men in tuxedos sold champagne with a slice of strawberry in it, a nice advanced touch. The show started with Madonna offstage, but some music that her fans seemed to recognize was played while elements of the stage revolved, and two dancers were lowered from near the ceiling on rope swings. Then Madonna was elevated from below the stage to great fanfare. She opened with "Vogue," which sounded great. The band, which, from what I could tell from my limited-viewing seat on the side of the stage, consisted of a drummer (who was fantastic), a guy playing keyboards and bass, a lead guitarist with a mohawk, and a couple of backup signers. Having a guy with a mohawk in your band is advanced if you are Madonna. It is not advanced if you are in Green Day or No Doubt. The backup singers were African American women, a must for the advanced artist. My only complaint about "Vogue" was that she seemed not very excited about singing it. She delivered the necessary performance, but lacked enthusiasm. "Vogue" was good, but not advanced, other than the band.  Things got advanced a little later when the dancers all emerged in fatigues (the "don't ask, don't tell" dancers, I wittily thought to myself) and acted like they were in the army. There were cages in which dancers would bang up against the bars and people would come and beat them. I can only assume this was a political statement about the recent torture scandals. Or perhaps it was just good luck? Things got really advanced when, during what I believe was "American Life," a bunch of dancers came out dressed as nuns, Hasidic Jews, Muslims, and just about every kind of person with international flavor you could think of. There was a theme of unity throughout the night--Madonna is a uniter, not a diva--and this was the most explicit example of that. The song rocked with unbelievable authority. It almost had a Ministry-type sound, and she seemed finally to be getting into it.  Another noteworthy moment was when she played "Burning Up" (or "Burning Up for Your Love," not sure of the name). It was noteworthy because she played the guitar. She is a novice at guitar (you can tell because she constantly looks down at the fret board and holds the pick in a very certain way, as if were the pick to shift in her fingers, she would be lost), but she clearly loved playing. People might scoff at this attempt, but I think it's rather brave to be a beginner and play in front of all those people. Plus, if you've been making music as long as she has, you have to make it fresh. I think that goes to the heart of the advanced theory (for me, anyway). A genius requires challenges. In the beginning of their careers, the challenges come from other people, whereas when they advance, the challenges are completely personal. So I love that she plays the guitar.  An advanced moment was when she covered "Imagine." Every critic I have read mentions this as being unfortunate or the low-point of the evening. I was ready to feel the same way, at least through an advanced lens. But everyone was moved and singing along. It was a moment that I think most critics couldn't enjoy because that song has become a cliché. But at one point, I'll bet even those critics loved the original version of that song, but that moment has been long forgotten. Now if, say, Britney Spears covered "Imagine," it would be awful (even though I love her). But Madonna is one of the few people who has had an impact as close to John Lennon's as anyone, so I say she has the right to cover it if she wants to. Plus, the audience, including me, all sang together, and it was a very nice moment. So good for her!  Let's finish up: She sang a lovely version of "Crazy for You," which she dedicated to her fans who have "stuck with her for 20 years." There was a sequence that included a guy playing bagpipes and a drum corps banged along. At one point the stage revolved to reveal a half-pipe, on which a skater did some minimal tricks. It almost goes without saying that he had a mohawk. There three truly amazing acrobats doing things on rope swings that were twenty feet in the air (without a net, of course). The dancers were also great. (Side note: I was a ballet/modern dancer for about 10 years. I went to the American Dance Festival, and so did Madonna!) Everything was done to perfection, except for a little problem Madonna had with a monitor and some lyrics, which she joked about good-naturedly. Her voice was great, and she sang the whole time. No lip-synching at all.  I think the most advanced part of the whole thing was the name of the tour: "The Re-Invention Tour." I have no idea what that refers to.  -J

      I'm a bit tired today because I hosted my karaoke show last night. I haven't seen anything in the news today that is interesting from the advanced point of view, so I'll just invite you to look at how many times Tom Waits starts songs with "well." I'll try to get back to explaining the theory later this afternoon.  -J

      Britt sent me these lyrics to illustrate the advanced/sports connection.   from coney island baby:  You know, man, when I was a young man in high school you believe it or not I wanted to play football for the coach And all those older guys they said he was mean and cruel, but you know wanted to play football for the coach They said I was to little too lightweight to play linebacker so I say I'm playing right-end wanted to play football for the coach 'Cause, you know some day, man you gotta stand up straight unless you're gonna fall then you're gone to die And the straightest dude I ever knew was standing right for me all the time So I had to play football for the coach and I wanted to play football for the coach  ------------------------- That is advanced, everybody.  -J

      Okay, now that I have a moment, I'll try to explain the advanced theory. It is easier to explain within a conversation, but that's why somebody invented the blog. So here goes: A lot of people feel like geniuses—I'll stick to musical geniuses—have a period where they are great but then inevitably decline. The classic advanced-theory example is Lou Reed. Most people feel that he was great in the Velvet Underground, had a couple great solo records, but then became lazy and released of lot of self-indulgent, mediocre music. The advanced theory says that Lou Reed did not decline at all. In fact, he keeps getting better or at the very least is every bit the genius he was as a young man.  The problem is, we don't understand him now any better than people understood him then. If he was ahead of his time when he was in VU, then he is ahead of his time now.  But let's go back. What made VU great? They wrote great songs, offered an alternative to the hippie peppermint-lollipop stuff, and were just generally cool. However, it was their unique sound and Reed's lyrics that set them apart from most other bands at the time. Being innovative was a central motivation, and they wore that motivation on their sleeves. They were, in advanced terminology, "overt weirdos." Overt weirdness is easy to achieve: get a green mohawk, were two different color shoes, don't wash your hair, and you will generally be considered weird. It's obvious, and that is the problem from the advanced point of view.  Lou Reed left VU, which was his first step to being an "advanced weirdo." Advanced artist almost always go solo because even their bandmates can't understand what they are doing. This gives them a reputation of being difficult, but few geniuses aren't. After Reed got out of VU, he continued to be overt. He got mixed up with David Bowie (a topic for later), which gave us "Take a Walk on the Wild Side." (For years, every time he played a talk show, he would play that song, cementing the public perception of him as a one-hit wonder. That was very advanced.) He put out albums that were totally depressing ("Berlin") or unlistenable ("Metal Machine Music") or mystifying ("Rock and Roll Animal"). Some of his solo stuff was successful and well-reviewed, most not. But in the eighties, I think he took a turn form being an overt weirdo to being an advanced weirdo.  If you've heard "White Light/White Heat" and "Mistrial," you know that his music changed to an astonishing degree. But I think that any cut on Mistrial is as good as "Sister Ray" and much weirder as well. Anyone can make a lot of noise and sing obscure lyrics, but it takes someone truly weird to make a song like "Original Wrapper," where he sings about watching TV, waffles, and, yes, pitchers and batters. He also perfected the advanced artist's uniform: black leather jacket, dark sunglasses, and long hair in the back. By the way, most people like to call it a mullet, but I think that is too overt a description. When Lou Reed's hair was short on top and long in the back, there were no mullet.coms or anywhere near the ironic attention paid to that hairstyle (irony has no place in advancement). His appearance was much weirder than the look he cultivated in VU because almost no one would appreciate it. In VU he at least had the transvestites and pushers on his side. But who would endorse the look he had during "Mistrial"? Certainly not the overt weirdo.  I'm going to wind up for now. Lou Reed's career has been long and has taken some pretty advanced turns.  -J

      just saw this:  ALL LOLLAPALOOZA DATES CANCELED Faced with several million dollars of losses, Lollapalooza organizers have decided to pull the plug on all dates. The tour's co-founder, Marc Geiger, stated, "I am in utter disbelief that a concert of this stature, with the most exciting line-up I've seen in years, did not galvanize ticket sales. I'm surprised that given the great bands and the reduced ticket prices that we didn't have enough sales to sustain the tour." The 13-year-old tour was set to begin in three weeks, and included the star-studded line-up of Morrissey, PJ Harvey, The Pixies, The Flaming Lips, Sonic Youth, among others. ------------------------  The phrase "13-year-old tour" could be read in another way: Lollapalooza is a tour for 13-year-olds. I'd love to see those bands, but I'm 33, and there is no way I'm going to an outdoor concert that lasts all day. So I'm not exactly shocked that the concert would fail to create interest. Now, if Lollapalooza were a series of 30-minute concerts (say, Thursday night, 9 P.M.) featuring those same bands, I'd be there. Well, I'd be there as long as the concerts were near my apartment and there was plenty of seating and good beer. Oh, and no smoking either.

      A friend recently shared this with me:  (from rollingstone.com)  The BOB DYLAN Show will kick off on August 6th in Cooperstown, New York, the birthplace of baseball. Following the show at Doubleday Field, Dylan will go on to perform at twenty-one minor league baseball parks across the country. Dylan, who once immortalized Hall of Fame pitcher "Catfish" Hunter in song, will be joined by country legend WILLIE NELSON and country swing troupe HOT CLUB OF COWTOWN. "What we aim to do with this tour," Dylan said, "is to hit the ball out of the park, touch all the bases and get home safely."   ------------ There is a connection between sports and advanced artists, but I haven't quite figured it out yet. Off the top of my head, I remember that Lou Reed mentions the football team at the high school where the Velvet Underground recorded one of their live albums. He wasn't advanced then, but I remember when I heard that as a younger man that it sounded rather strange coming from the man who wrote "Venus in Furs." Also, Elton John wore the sequined Dodgers uniform when he played that huge concert in L.A. in the seventies. But his most advanced outfit had to be the Donald Duck costume (more on that later). The U2 video that centered around the kicker for a football team and had John Madden in it strikes me as particularly advanced. Now Bob Dylan is touring minor league baseball stadiums. The last quote I find particularly advanced, especially from someone considered the "voice of his generation." It's also great that he once sang about Catfish Hunter.   I guess what I have to say is that people who try to be overtly weird would not admit to liking sports. They might say that they enjoy "football," meaning soccer, because that is not typical of an American. I would assume that European overt weirdos pretend to love anything but soccer. Now, I'm sure that some people only like soccer or don't like sports at all. Those people can still be advanced. But if they don't like sports because they don't think they fit in to their perception of what it is to be weird, then they are overt.

      This is from the notes of Alice Cooper's (he's advanced) iTunes Playlist. He's talking about "Bob Dylan's 155th Dream":  "It speaks for itself. Bob Dylan is definitely weirder than me."  Exactly. Alice Cooper's weirdness was always a bit of a put-on, and he'd be the first to tell you that. He had to drink himself into oblvion to "become" Alice. Now he likes to play golf on VH1, though he still makes Alice-appropriate music. He's sort of like Ozzy Osborne, but on purpose.

      I was sent this bit from the Hollywood Reporter:  Music and entertainment television networks -- from E! to MTV and VH1 -- have become loony for lists, as anyone who has spent an entire Saturday afternoon glued to their TV screen strangely mesmerized by a seemingly endless marathon of countdown shows can attest..... But as those oh-so-preciously edgy, over-designed numbers -- representing who's hottest, coolest and rockingest -- whiz by, music and movie buffs above the age of 13 are usually left dumbfounded by the order in which artists are listed.  "That was the major impetus," says Kool Moe Dee on penning his new tome "There's a God on the Mic: The True 50 Greatest MCs."  "With MTV or BET, their only concern is viewership," adds the seminal rapper behind such early hip-hop hits as "Go See the Doctor," "Wild Wild West" and "How Ya Like Me Now." "Any network -- any business -- they are not trying to be accurate, they're just trying to be popular. I just hated the fact that there's never any criteria set up. BET or MTV, you just go online and put your vote in. We forsake everything for the sake of business now." [I like the way he puts "forsake" and "for the sake" next to each other. -jh] ----------------------  urlLink Here  is a pretty advanced looking picture of KMD. I'm not sure if he really is advanced, but I always love it when musicians write "tomes." It's especially great that he's written a countdown book as a response to all the countdowns around these days. Plus, he's rating artists in a genre that includes him, so I really hope he proclaims himself the number one MC of all time.   I'm guessing LL Cool J will not be on the list.  An update: He's making a movie too! Read all about Kool Moe Dee  urlLink here .

      What happens to advanced artists if the advanced theory becomes widely known? I guess that, according to the theory, they would have to abandon the traditional advanced ways. But then again, that would be doing the opposite of what is expected of them, so who knows what they'll do? And what of the wannabes? They'll start doing things that fit into the theory, but they will be doing it overtly, so they'll still be overt. Luckily, though, anyway you dress it up, advancement can't be faked. That's why when an advanced artist does something that doesn't quite fit in with the theory, it still "feels" advanced.

      Quote from an article at  urlLink billboard.com :  "It's about the deep gulf between the 'red' and the 'blue' parts of the country. I made it a sci-fi alternate reality so that I could exaggerate the differences." --------------- The album is described as a "rock opera of sorts." I'm very excited about this one.

      This news from MTV was sent to me:  The Bangles will be handed an honorary degree on Friday from the Liverpool Institute of the Performing Arts by none other than Paul McCartney, who helped found the school in 1996. In March 2003, the Bangles took time out from their European tour to conduct a master class at the institute, which was reportedly the highest attended and most popular session the school has ever held. All four Bangles will be inducted as "Companions," an honor reserved for people who have not only achieved greatness within the performing arts, but who have also passed advice and help to LIPA students, and it will be the first time an entire band will receive this honor. ---------------- One of the things that advanced artists do is celebrate artists that are far beneath them. Not that I don't like the Bangles, but I wouldn't exactly say they have "achieved greatness." In fact, it has always depressed me that in one of their videos, a fan holds up a personalized license plate that reads, "Bangles 1." I just can't imagine putting that much energy into my love of a band like the Bangles. But anyway, Paul McCartney thinks they're great, so what do I know?  I do think Paul is advanced by the way, despite what you've read in "Esquire." Britt thinks the Beatles were the "New Kids on the Block" of the '60s, so he would probably say that he is not advanced. I think his bass playing alone qualifies him as great enough to be able to advance. And his guitar solo on "Taxman" is so great, I can hardly believe it.   I'm a part of a very slim minority that believes the Beatles don't get enough credit.

      Here is a description of the Queen musical, which opens soon in Las Vegas:  "The story, written by Ben Elton, is set in a homogenized future society where a group of rebels sets out to find out what rock 'n' roll is."  That sounds almost unbearably advanced. Sort of "Mr. Roboto" meets "Battlefield Earth."

Ian Curtis was of course overt, but New Order seems pretty advanced to me. In a nonrock, eurotech sort of way.  In other Joy Division news, the house where Ian Curtis killed himself is up for sale. It is described as "perfect for first-time buyers."

      Little something about Aerosmith from  urlLink Yahoo! LAUNCH :  [Steven] Tyler now has an honorary doctorate in music from Berklee College of Music; [Joe] Perry has his own hot sauce. "Every dream we ever had came true, and then some," Tyler said. --------------------- Interesting dreams they had entering into the music business. I'm reminded of the scene in "The Three Amigos" where the Amigos daydream about what they will do after they get their reward for defeating El Guapo. But in the Aerosmith version, it would be this:  Perry: Hey, man. What's your dream? You know, if we make it as rock stars. Tyler: I'd like to have an honorary degree from Berklee College of Music. What's yours? Perry: I want to have my own hot sauce.  It's nice to see that dreams can come true.

      From  urlLink Rolling Stone :  California rockers Dios, whose debut album of the same name was released in March, have changed their name to Dios Malos after a cease-and-desist order was issued by Ronnie James Dio. The singer, who since 1983 has fronted the band Dio, believed the similarity in names would cause confusion among audiences.  "It's pretty retarded," Dios' bassist J.P. Cabellaro says. "It seemed like a joke at first." Unfortunately, Dio wasn't kidding. Despite claims from Dio fans that the band purposefully chose a name after the heavy-metal vocalist, Cabellaro says that was never the intent. "When we named our band we were thinking of God," he says. "[Dios] is 'God' in Spanish. That's what it means to hundreds of millions of people all over the world. It didn't really seem like there was going to be any point of confusion. We're up against rainbows and magic. " Dio had no comment by press time. ------------------ It is unbelievably overt to name your band "God" in Spanish. Dio must be acting as an agent of God who didn't want some crappy alt-rock band using his name. And if they really  want to name their band "Bad God," it's "Dios Malo," not "Dios Malos." There's no "s."  My suggestion would have been "Grupo Malo."

       urlLink Here  is a little something about John Cale's "new" album in Rolling Stone. I think he has stayed overt throughout his career, but here are a couple of things that interested me:  "The pace for recording a song was so fleet that one song, 'Things,' appears in two markedly different versions, though both have the same slightly humorous root. Cale snatched the key line, 'things to do in Denver when you're dead' from the 1995 neo-noir film, not knowing that the film had pinched the title from a Warren Zevon tune from four years earlier. 'I found about Zevon's song to my embarrassment about a year later,' Cale says.... I guess I should've realized that that title itself was so Warren Zevon-esque. But I didn't pick up on it. But hey, what's good enough for the master is good enough for the man." --------------- Is Warren Zevon the master in this scenario? That would probably surprise a lot of the overt folks in the world. Cale might be more advanced than I thought.  And here's something about a band I like:  "I was looking at an old picture of the VU the other day," Cale says. "We were standing around at the opening of the Paraphernalia store, where Andy [Warhol] sort of gave us our first gig. I called somebody and asked, 'Where was the PA system on that gig?' And this friend said, 'There was no PA on that gig.' He told me that the voices and guitars all came out of the guitar amps and there were only three of those. I thought, 'Man, we must've sounded like shit.' There's still this level of lo-fi that seems to be inspired by that era. I guess the depths have yet to be plummeted on that one." ---------------- They probably did sound terrible. But there is nothing quite as exciting as seeing a band that you know will develop into something really interesting before they've gotten their sound together. Anyway, I like that he describes the lo-fit movement as exploring depths. I think that a lot of overt bands try the lo-fi sound to mask their inadequacies (Guided by Voices is an exception). It is not as hard to do innovative things when you are limited by technology or budget as it is when you can do anything you want. If you've got a day in the studio to record and mix 14 songs, of course you're going to be innovative. You've got no choice. But you can't fully realize your intentions, so we're left with the promise of what could have been--like that band before they get their sound together--which is almost always better than what actually happens when bands get the time and money they need to make the music the way it's "supposed" to sound (with a string section, of course). But advanced artists have all the time and money they need to do whatever they want and still come out with something interesting and bizarre. Lou Reed is famous for looking for the perfect clean sound, and I think that is an effort not to hide behind anything. VU was great at making loud noises and the noises you could just barely hear, but what made them great was that Lou Reed could write real songs that didn't rely on being lo-fi to be interesting. That's why he's the advanced artist he is today.  I hope all that makes sense.

      John Lennon's marrying Yoko was advanced, though probably not for the reason you think. He loved her because she was interesting, not because she was beautiful (though he found her attractive). Same goes with Paul McCartney and Linda. These guys could have any woman they wanted but they didn't choose movie stars or models. The overt artist will always go for the trophy girlfriend or wife (if he's a man). So what of Mick Jagger and David Bowie's marriage? Well, I think Jerry Hall was more than just your average model, but there is still a certain amount of overtness in that choice. But marrying Iman is not overt for David Bowie. Why? Because she's Iman.  I'll probably talk more about how choice of mate relates to overtness/advancement in the future.

And now they're performing in their old suits and flowerpots at a corporate-sponsored event at Central Park. The reviewer at the  urlLink New York Times  seemed to enjoy. The Yeah Yeah Yeahs were part of the bill (Devo is advanced to allow themselves to be seen with such overtness), and, predictably, the reviewer didn't think much of the music but mentioned the singer's outfit.  Oh yeah, and "THe Rugrats."

      Here are  a few remarks from Harold Bloom about "Don Quixote" that should be interesting to all who follow the advanced theory:  "Cervantes is always out ahead of us, and we can never quite catch up."  "Here are two characters [Don Quixote and Hamlet]...who seem always to know what they are doing, though they baffle us whenever we try to share their knowledge."  "We cannot know the object of Don Quixote's quest unless we ourselves are Quixotic (note the capital Q)." -parentheses by the author  Bloom has provided the perfect summary of the theory: The advanced artists are always ahead of us, they know what they are doing even though we are baffled, and we can't understand them unless we ourselves are advanced.   So there you go.

      There's a nice little Q&A at the  urlLink Independent . Some sample questions and answers:  Q: Some people might be surprised that you've allowed Dab Hands to remix "Satellite of Love". Why did you? Leo Baker, London  A: Why would they be surprised? Would they think I wanted to keep it sacred? In fact, I really like a lot of what's out there. I get sent a lot of remixes. For some reason a lot of them are from the UK - I don't know why. One time, this band called Medicine 8 sent me a new version of a track that only a Velvet Underground aficionado would know existed. They did it so much better than I did and I love when that happens. What some of these younger people are doing with computers and with the sound is really amazing. I love that stuff.  Q: A lot of the younger bands are drawing on the sound pioneered by the Velvet Underground and other Sixties groups for their inspiration. How difficult is it to find new things to say in rock music? Katrina Stewart, Dublin  A: How difficult is it to find new things to say in a novel or a painting? It's the same question. There are a billion subjects you can set to music, don't you think? But I don't know if current bands are stuck in a rut. How should I know? I'm not a critic. In any case, there's always someone breaking new ground. At the moment, I think the production in hip-hop and dance is at the forefront of that. The drum sound that Missy Elliot gets. I mean, how did they do that? That's amazing. Some of that technology is so fabulous, so powerful.   Q: How big a kick was it to feature on the cover of Kung Fu magazine in the States last year?  Pat George, Boston  A: That was a terrific thrill. I earned the right to be on that cover. I've done martial arts for 20 years - I study with the Chen Tai Chi Master, Ren Guang-Yi, in New York. It means everything to me.  ------------------ I'm particularly excited about the Kung Fu business because I'm looking into Elvis's advancement. Of course Lou Reed would say Missy Elliot is geat because most advanced musicians point to hip-hop as the most interesting music. There's also some good stuff about allowing your music to be used in commercials.  Anyway, kind of interesting.

      Chuck Berry is advanced:  1. "My Ding a Ling" (his first gold record) 2. For many years, his backup band has been whatever terrible band happened to be in the area. 3. His signature riff was stolen from his piano player, and he admits it. 4. Sings a lot about rock'n'roll. 5. Many of his songs sound exactly the same. 6. He flies to gigs in commercial planes and checks his guitar. 7. His guitar is hardly ever in tune. 8. Most advanced people worship him. 9. He refused to release albums for many years. 10. He had problems with the I.R.S. (see Willie Nelson) 11. He made Keith Richards look sane. 12. Here's what Robert Quine has to say about "Waves of Fear" from Lou Reed's 1982 album "The Blue Mask": "The first time I heard it, I knew exactly what I would do. Got out the Fernandes, the Memory Man, the little Peavey Bandit, got that scary chorus sound, and did these Chuck Berry things up and down the neck. It just fell into place." 13. Infuriates everyone who loves him. 14. He has released countless "Greatest Hits" with the same songs on them. 15. "Hail, Hail Rock'n'Roll"  There's a lot more, I'm sure, but you get the picture.

      (this has nothing to do with advancement, really)  In case you didn't know, when something is reviewed and is given stars (one star bad, four stars great, etc.), the stars are usually given by the editor, not the writer (I hope I don't get into trouble here). If a popular and powerful artist gets a bad review, the editor often gives more stars than the writer thinks the record or movie deserves. Of course, if that same popular and powerful artist is no longer popular and powerful, then an editor will feel free to give their work the amount of stars it really deserves (I'm talking to you, Courtney Love!). With this in mind, I'd like to give you a little sample from a couple of movie reviews from  urlLink Rolling Stone :  "Extraordinary in every way, from the pitch-perfect performances to the delicate handling of explosive subject matter, 'The Door in the Floor' is also a model of page-to-screen adaptation."  (Three and half stars)  "Will Ferrell is the go-to guy if you want to laugh your-self silly. He could read your mom's Rolodex and get you giggling. Sadly, your mom's Rolodex would provide richer comic material than "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.'" (Three stars)  So the difference between a movie that is "extraordinary in every way" and one that would have been funnier had it used your mother's Rolodex (my mom has a PDA, and it is hilarious!) as source material is half a star.  The whole star business is completely worthless. (two and a half stars)

      Sting has to be advanced, but somehow I just can't embrace him as an advanced artist. He's done it all: played the Super Bowl halftime show, gone solo, taken all the credit for his former band's music, explored world music, starred in movies, let his music be used in commercials, infuriated Police fans, and don't forget that remake of "Don't Stand So Close to Me." But I just can't bring myself to call him advanced. I have a theory that maybe Sting was always terrible, but Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland somehow got him to write good songs. I cannot recognize what Sting does today as in any way related to what he did with the Police. Ordinarily I would say that's a nice advanced move, but his music is incredibly lifeless.   When I was in Berlin a few years ago, I signed up for what I thought would be a modern-dance class. Turns out what's known as "modern" in New York is known as "New Dance" in Berlin, and what's known as "modern" in Berlin is known as "jazz" in New York. Anyway, I realized during the warm-up that the class was going to be jazz, not modern. But I didn't want to be rude, so I stayed until the end. Adding to my misery, the music we were dancing to was really generic, like a step below smooth jazz. After about 20 minutes of torture, I realized that the awful music we had been listening to was Sting. I was astonished.   So what happened? Was he terrible and saved by his bandmates? Is he so advanced that I can't see it? If you believe in the advanced theory as I do, Sting should be advanced. Now I know how Stephen Hawking must have felt trying to figure out what happens to information in black holes. If you can prove to me that Sting is advanced, I'll give you a rock'n'roll encyclopedia.

      I've realized over the years that it takes many conversations to fully explain the advanced theory. I've tried to re-create for you the process that my friends who understand the theory went through. People new to the theory usually ask if something is advanced, I tell them that is or it isn't and why, then that person goes away to think about it. This is repeated over and over until finally they get it. Since we can't really go through this process together, I'll attempt to anticipate your questions and answer them. I'll also give you examples that have nothing to do with music, but everything to do with the theory. For instance:  If you have a spotted dog and you name him Spot, this could be advanced or overt. It would be overt if you did it to be ironic or funny. If you did it because you like the name Spot or had a dog named Spot when you were a child, that would be advanced. Even though people might think that you are being funny or that you aren't creative, you named your dog Spot to please yourself. If you have a dog with no spots and you name him Spot, that is overt, no matter what.

      I've been searching in vain for any interviews where Lou Reed talks about how much he likes the cover of "Take a Walk on the Wild Side" that Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch did a long time ago. I remember his liking it or even that the new version was beter than his, but I can't find any evidence. I did find an interview with Roger Waters who says that the Marky Mark version turns his stomach but it doesn't seem to bother Lou Reed. That's because Roger Waters is overt.   If anyone can find a good article proving that Lou Reed loved Marky Mark's version of "Take a Walk on the Wild Side," be sure to let me know.

      As you get older,  urlLink terrible things  happen to your body. Mike Watt seems like an incredibly decent person. People who love the bass, as opposed to those who play guitar but play bass in a band because they chose the shortest straw, always seem to be special. One of my favorite songs ever is the Minutemen song where D. Boon sings about playing guitars with Mike Watt. It's the most beautiful song about writing music that I know. Now I'm bummed out. I guess  urlLink terrible things  happen to your body even when you're young.  This post doesn't have much to do with advancement, so let's lighten the mood: I wonder if Mike Watt ever got tired of D. Boon's jazzy solos?

      (check out the June archive for pt. 1)  Britt and I had a conversation today about the advanced theory and how angry it makes people. The problem, I think,  is that it is easy to get caught up in the possiblities of the theory and neglect its essence. Britt said something that I think is important: All the theory says is that certain artists reject traditional rock'n'roll with the idea that they are somehow about it. Then, as they get older, they embrace the things they used to reject. I'm paraphrasing--Britt put it more elegantly. Hopefully he'll write more about that idea. My take is that overtness is rejecting something without understanding it, while being advanced is understanding something and recognizing that there is no need to reject it. As always, there's so much more to say.

      More from  urlLink billboard.com :  Journey was honored at Chicago's Wrigley Field during last night's (July 15) Cubs game as part of "Classic Rock Night." Guitarist Neal Schon and keyboardist Jonathan Cain performed a Journey-fied instrumental version of the National Anthem before Cain threw out the ceremonial first pitch.   Later, Cain joined singer Steve Augeri to sing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game," during the seventh-inning stretch. The performance by a celebrity is a Cubs tradition begun after the death of longtime Cubs announcer Harry Caray, whose enthusiastic renditions of the song were a hallmark of his broadcasts and the experience of catching a game at Wrigley.  Since his death, movie stars, politicians, local sports figures and musical guests such as Shania Twain, Eddie Vedder and long-times Cubs fan Billy Corgan have all taken part. Journey added a little bit of its hit "Wheel in the Sky," before leading the stadium-wide sing-along. ------------------------- Though Journey rocks, they aren't really advanced (even though they tour with some guy who sounds like Steve Perry). But I just love that they wove a little bit of "Wheel in the Sky" into "Take Me Out to the Ball Game." Would Harry be the wheel in the sky?

      The officical Keith Richards  urlLink website  has an "Ask Keith" feature where regular people ask Keith regular questions and he gives advanced answers. There's one that I enjoy where a guy says that he is a beginner guitarist and has trouble keeping time. Here are parts of Keith's answer:  "I don't know who you're palying with. If you're playing to a metronome, I'd be lousy to [sic], y'know. I think it's a matter of--don't be too afraid of like counting an [sic] all that." He goes on: "...I'm blessed with being playing all of my professional life with Charlie Watts, Steve Jordans and, you know, Georgie Rocellis and Zigaboo Melodistas [sic]...what's your drummer like?"  I'm guessing that this beginning guitarist's drummer is not much like Zigaboo Melodiste.

      According to  urlLink billboard.com , a remix of "Satellite of Love" done by Dab Hands will be released in the UK. It will be called "Satellite of Love 2004," which is an advanced title. The remix is already out in the clubs, where it is gaining popularity. Advanced artists always approve of their songs being remixed, but Lou Reed will also promote the single himself.

      A little about "Hearts of Fire" starring Bob Dylan (From Britt, courtesy of the Advancement Foundation):  "Good lord it puts me in an advanced state of mind. My wife's grandfather was a famous actor and  urlLink acting teacher . Anyway, they lived across the street from Bob Dylan--Bob called Jeff one day and said he had been offered some acting part and needed help. Jeff told him to come over and maybe he could help him. Bob arrived a little bit later on his bicycle (he lives directly across the street) in some ridiculous getup that included a gigantic straw hat. He told Jeff that he thought his biggest hurdle was going to be that he had no idea how one went about not acting like themselves-a funny comment considering who it was. I think 'Hearts of Fire' may prove he never overcame this. Anyhow, Jeff--who had taught James Dean, Jack Nicholson and a whole host of other great actors--tried to dissuade him from pursuing acting."  ---------------- Advanced rockers do love to appear in movies. I think Tom Petty, whose advancement might be questioned because people like most of his stuff, should be applauded for appearing in "The Postman" starring Kevin Costner. That was the movie that was like "Water World," but about mail delivery.

      From  urlLink georgejones.com :  Make way, Emeril Lagasse. Paul Newman, watch your back.  Nashville country artists are looking for shelf space.... Celebrity-branded foods include George Jones' product line, which is expanding into bacon and bottled water....Jones used to watch his singles climb the radio charts. Now he follows the supermarket trades to see what grocery stores are adding his line of sausage, biscuits and condiments.  ''It's like in the old days when you hear that 100 radio stations just added your single,'' said Evelyn Shriver, president of his label, Bandit Records. ''George is now caught up in the food chart.'' For Jones, 72, getting involved in the food business provided a new outlet for his energy. Contemporary country radio isn't friendly to his new singles, but he apparently still has marketing power in the grocery business: a 600-store chain in Illinois recently agreed to carry his products, all made in Tennessee.  ''George just loves hearing (stuff) like that,'' Shriver said. ''He spends a lot of time checking on product. He goes to the supermarket all the time now, like he used to go to record stores. He still wants to participate.'' New products this spring include microwaveable bacon, sausage links and a line of bottled water from a Hohenwald spring called ''White Lightning,'' named after his first No. 1 record, in 1959.   ------------------ I always thought "White Lightning" was about bottled water.

      From   urlLink cnn.com :  Former Dead Kennedys lead singer Jello Biafra has dropped his remaining lawsuit against members of his band.... [A judge decided that] the band's creative output, including songs "Holiday in Cambodia" and "Kill the Poor," belongs to a partnership formed among the four band members.... "Personally and professionally, I just want to put this entire chapter behind us and concentrate on making music again," bassist Klaus Flouride said. The San Francisco-based punk band performed together from 1978 to 1986. The band re-formed without Biafra and has been playing as the Dead Kennedys, according to its publicist, Josh Mills.  ---------------------- I've always been a fan of Jello Biafra's lawsuit because I find it really advanced for someone like him to sue his fellow bandmates over royalties, among other things. And I also approve of the band's touring without him but still calling themselves Dead Kennedys. Kudos to them all.   A little background from a fan  urlLink site :  The Dead Kennedys formed in San Francisco in 1978 and quickly developed a reputation for shocking and satiric lyrics. The band separated in 1986. Their legal problems arose in 1998, when three former band members sued lead singer Jello Biafra, whose real name is Eric Reed Boucher. The three band members claimed that Biafra didn't properly promote the group's albums and wrongfully exploited their collective intellectual property through his own record label. Biafra answered that he had exclusive rights to the catalog. He also cross-complained, seeking the dissolution of Decay Music, a general partnership the four band members formed in 1981 to publish records, retain rights to the music and collect income from royalties.  --------------- I can almost guarantee a reunion tour within five years.

      According to  urlLink billboard.com  (scroll down, past the Judy Collins/Leonard Cohen story), Bob Dylan is getting into the wine business. He's put his signature on an Italian red wine produced by  urlLink Fattoria Le Terrazze . About the wine:  "The 2002 vintage is a blend of 75% Montepulciano and 25% Merlot grapes grown on the winery's vineyards in Italy's Marche region. It follows Visions of J, a Fattoria Le Terrazze wine that its owner, Antonia Terni, named after the Dylan song 'Visions of Johanna,' prior to any association with the artist."  Sounds good. And advanced.

      A member of the Advanced Think Tank wrote recently:  "Diamond Dave's No Holds Bar-Be-Que" was advanced to the point of being unwatchable. It alternated scenes of Dave doing martial arts with fantasy scenes set in his house, where he tried to make two women look like a bevy thereof. His cover of "Baker Street" was the background music during one martial arts scene.  -------------- Just to let all of you know, David Lee Roth is advanced. You don't have to look any further than "Just a Gigolo" as far as I'm concerned. But I've found some very interesting things about him that I'd like to share with you. From an interview at  urlLink nudeasthenews.com :  NATN: What other jobs have you done? DLR: I worked in surgery for two years out of junior college. I was a surgical assist and what they call a nuclear janitor. Nuclear medicine was just coming in-- MRIs and CAT scans were just barely starting and you had to have a nuclear designation on your union card. And you know, you had to go through all kinds of stuff and training and so forth. And I worked at all state hospitals, burn wards and so forth and I worked night shift in the barrio. I've got expertise in interesting areas, I guess.  NATN: Can you use that on stage? DLR:I've actually used it on a few people! I've actually run into some serious accidents along the way. Rock and roll is pretty predictable -- it's the other 38 stamps in my passport that I spent the money on. Don't ask me how to spell New Guinea but I've got the pictures of both of us there (laughs)!  NATN: OK, so you're touring and you've got a new album (Diamond Dave). Is it deja vu? ? DLR: No, it's not deja vu. It's only deja vu if you're doing the same show and the same routine over and over again. There are some bands that are extraordinary at that. The Rolling Stones have been playing the same song over and over and over again for, what do you think, 25, 30 years? I like the song though! AC/DC has been playing the same song, album by album for 30 years but we dig the song. I do believe, however, that mankind was destined for change. There are only two things that really look exactly the same from the moment you first see them to the moment they are dead and they are a sea anemone and Neil Young (laughs).  NATN: Neil Young? There's no way he came out like that. DLR: Oh, absolutely, I'm convinced.  NATN: Soooo.. what was this video shoot thing I read about? DLR: Oh! Three days of fun and music. No, that was Woodstock. What I was doing was the VH1 Classic "Diamond Dave's No-Holds Barbeque and Christmas Special." Is that what you're referring to? 'Cause if you weren't, you should be.  NATN: Fourth of July? Christmas? DLR: I just finished 70 spots of my own creation -- completely of my own creation -- with all the guest characters that I served you up in "Gigilo" and "California Girls," which I wrote and directed. In this we have the Dom triplets from Playboy, as pregnant white chain smoking trash and I know you're thinking, 'Diamond Dave, you don't have to be white to be pregnant chain smoking trash,' and I'll tell you, 'sweetheart, it sure helps.' Why can't they be heroes too, goddamn it (pause for laugh)? I have a low-rider donkey -- don't ask, just watch -- I have the security guy from the circus, Jumbo Jimmy. My hallucinations are what your reality caused me to have after happy hour. Ridicule and sarcasm were refined arts in my family and I have a black belt (laughs). I came out of the Roth family history with the scars and the bars (laughs). Stars and the scars.  NATN: You deserve it, I guess. DLR: I don't base what I do in the eyes of others. [In French accent] What was it, Sartre? He said the most famous single sentence in all of philosophy study, um, [in French] 'hell is in the others.' You may have heard it. They teach you that within the first 30 days of any philosophy class at any university and what it means is, if you are looking to find yourself reflected in the eyes of the others or you are judging your performance or whatever it is you do by how others see it, you will be in hell. Somebody may say, 'well Dave, what about those hardcore Van Halen fans,' and I said, 'they grew up and stopped buying records.' I never really considered what 40-somethings think about music, any more than what 20-somethings think about it. For everyone reading this right now, I think I know what's best for everybody. That's where we're going.  ...[touring] is like living on a submarine. You know, there's long, long periods of absolutely nothing followed by brief intense panic. And whatever happens after the show, well, what I do before the show in preparation: the video, the interview, the recording process and so forth is kind of a combination of Groucho Marx and Kurosawa. What I do onstage is somewhere between, I don't know, Bruce Lee and the scarecrow from "The Wizard Of Oz" and what I do after the show is somewhere between Errol Flynn and that other basketball player (laughs). -------------------------- The statement "I think I know what's best for everybody" is very advanced considering the moves he's made over the years. His reflections on Satre and hardcore Van Halen fans is also brilliant. Plus, he gets in a reference to basketball. I also looked a bit at his  urlLink website , where you can use the Sammy Hagar Random Insult Generator or read one of Dave's Zen poems. Or check out his experience as an  urlLink EMT .  You just don't get any more advanced than David Lee Roth. According to Britt (and I agree) DLR is in Mick Jagger territory. He just makes up his own rules of advancement and we are left to marvel.

      According to  urlLink CNN , Glen Campbell played a concert for his fellow prisoners while he was in jail for DUI. What particularly amused me was this:  He pleaded guilty in May to extreme DUI and leaving the scene of an accident, then began his jail term on July 1 with his final eight days set up as work-release. Campbell was allowed to leave the jail, where he had a indoor private cell, during the day to handle business affairs, returning overnight. "It's been an eye-opener, that's for sure," Campbell said of his time behind bars. ------------------------- That does sound like an eye opener. Also, I like that it was "extreme DUI." Regular DUI wasn't good enough. Just once, I'd like to hang out with George Jones and Glen Campbell. I can only imagine how weird those two guys are.

      There was a good article about Elvis Costello in the  urlLink NY times  this weekend. Here are some good parts:  Listeners and critics who expect performers to stay in their niches have repeatedly dismissed and then grudgingly rediscovered him, a cycle that clearly rankles Mr. Costello. "Sometimes the accusations of vanity about working in other areas are just so stupid," he said. "And a lot of it is down to the fact that you do something over a long period of time or you do something that's very heartfelt. Sometimes you want to grab somebody by the throat and say, `This is real life.' You get defensive about things you love."  Mr. Costello will turn 50 on Aug. 25, and he had originally booked a date at Carnegie Hall to celebrate the birthday. Then came a better offer: three nights at the Lincoln Center Festival this week, with three different ensembles and more than five dozen songs to learn, among them at least half a dozen that Mr. Costello has never recorded. On Tuesday, he is to sing with the Metropole Orkest, a 52-member jazz orchestra from the Netherlands that combines a big band with a string section. The concert will include arrangements by the guitarist Bill Frisell, by Mr. Costello's longtime pianist Steve Nieve and by Sy Johnson, who has done arrangements for the Mingus Orchestra.  On Thursday, it's back to rock. Mr. Costello is to perform with the Imposters, who include Mr. Nieve and the drummer Pete Thomas, both from his longtime rock band the Attractions, plus a bass player, Davey Faragher, who joined them in 2001. They have just completed an album at Sweet Tea Studios in Oxford, Miss., "The Delivery Man," that is due for release in September, and they are likely to perform some new songs. On Saturday the Brooklyn Philharmonic is to perform "Il Sogno," an orchestral score Mr. Costello wrote for an Italian dance company's adaptation of "A Midsummer Night's Dream," and to accompany Mr. Costello in full orchestral arrangements of his songs. A recording of "Il Sogno" conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas is also due for release in September.  --------------------- I'm most excited about the score he has done for the Italian dance company. That's pretty advanced. A little more:  "The Delivery Man" [a new album] revs up the already ferocious attack the Imposters showed on "When I Was Cruel." While the songs were written before Mr. Costello arrived in Mississippi, the album is steeped in Southern Americana: the gospel-rooted grooves of Memphis soul, touches of pedal steel guitar, Southern-rooted guest singers including Emmylou Harris and Lucinda Williams and the storytelling that Southern soul shares with country music.  Initially, Mr. Costello had planned "The Delivery Man" as an album that told a story, along the lines of Willie Nelson's "Red-Headed Stranger." The setting is a small town, perhaps in the South; the main characters are three women. "It's an imaginary place but so is everything these days," he said. "But they are three particular types of person. One who imagines herself wilder and more dangerous than she is. Another who is very restrained and pious. And a young woman, a young girl really, a teenage girl who hasn't decided which way she wants to go in life. And they all in different ways look for something that they don't have in this guy who just passes through their life." ---------------------- It's always advanced for a British guy to go record in the American South. "Gospel-rooted grooves" and "Memphis soul" just scream advancement. Also, using Willie Nelson (an advanced country musician) as an inspiration is beautiful. One more thing:  [about his new album] "It's the kind of rock and roll music that a man of my years can play without embarrassment. It doesn't sound processed. It's some guys playing in the room. I hate that expression good old rock and roll. When did it become good and when did it become old?" ---------------------- It always comes back to rock'n'roll.

      This weekend, I found out that a very advanced (and well-known) artist wanted to know if his next project would be advanced (I have to protect my sources). This artist is extremely advanced, and nothing he could do would be considered otherwise. But it got me to thinking: Now that the theory has been made public, what effect will it have on advanced artists? How will advanced artists react now that their "secret" is out? Since they typically do the unexpected, I guess I have no idea, since I'm not as advanced as they are. Also, there was some discussion in the advanced community about whether it is overt to ask someone if what you are doing is advanced. I think in some cases yes, but only if the person is someone who is striving to become advanced rather than already advanced. It will certainly be interesting to see how the theory's becoming public knowledge will alter the advanced landscape.

      I'm going to Seattle, so there won't be any posts for a while, unless I spend some time at an Apple store or think of something good to write in the next hour or so. Seattle is a wonderful town, though most of the bands that I know from there are/were overt (I'm not much of an expert). I think Kurt Cobain might have ended up advanced had he stuck around, but I'm not all that crazy about Nirvana. I think they had some great songs, but I never sit down and listen to a whole Nirvana album. It gets kind of tiring listening to his solos that were basically the vocal melody played on guitar, and his lyrics just don't move me. And I always hated the name Nirvana (you know, heaven for cool people). In any case, they were certainly overt because he was still using heroin, the world's most overt drug for rock stars. Many advanced artists rode the horse, but they had the good sense to get off before they got to the ranch. Uh-huh.   I don't know if I even need to say this, but Eddie Vedder could never be advanced. I can get rocked by a few of Pearl Jam's songs, however.

      from an  urlLink old interview :  Because I never cared for trends, that never bothered me. Music was what bothered me, what interested me. I always believed that I have something important to say and I said it. That's why I survived because I still believe I've got something to say. My God is rock'n'roll. It's an obscure power that can change your life. The most important part of my religion is to play guitar.

      from  urlLink spin.com :  S: You must have been witness to the gamut of devotion over the years from fans basically pledging themselves to you. Through all the albums, all the sort of changes in style, the creative evolution, what is the constant that holds people to your music?  R: I think it's that people believe I'm not going to say yes to something I really think I should say no to. It's as simple as that.  S: So it's a matter of personal integrity?  R: That's why I agonized about the Hewlett-Packard ad that used "Pictures of You." I was backed into a corner with that and I still feel really bad about it.  S: I heard the [Cult Hero song] "I Dig You" song in an ad.  R: That's not my song.  S: But the old fans know that you played on it. Somebody licensed it to somebody to sell something.  R: I agreed to that, fuck yeah, because I still know Frank The Postman, and he's running a garage, so it's like pay day money. But it's different. There's no real emotional investment in Cult Hero. That was me at like nineteen, but it's not the Cure. "Pictures of You" is a huge song in the Cure cannon. It means a lot.  S: That whole record?  R: Yeah, and it means a lot to a lot of people. I mean I despair at the use of Hendrix, in particular, to sell cars in the UK.  S: To sell everything.  R: It's fucking awful. [When I licensed the song] I was out of contract I had nothing left as leverage, except to basically give Universal an advert in exchange for remastering the albums. Otherwise they wouldn't do it.  ---------------------------------  I like the Cure, but Robert Smith is not advanced. I don't think that there's any shame in licensing a song for a commercial, but you have to admit you did it for the money (if that's the reason). Saying "I was backed into a corner" is pretty lame. If he was worried about his integrity or his fans, he would have turned down the licensing deal, no matter what. After all, anyone can refuse an offer if they don't need the money. Timbuk 3 has refused to license "The Future's So Bright, I Gotta Wear Shades" (a very advanced title, now that I think of it) even though Pat MacDonald has fallen on hard times, according to this  urlLink bob seger website :  Pat MacDonald, a  singer/songwriter best known as the leader of the band Timbuk  3, which had a hit in 1986 with the single "The Future's So  Bright, I Gotta Wear Shades." Since that release, MacDonald has fallen on hard times: He  divorced his wife (the other member of Timbuk 3), began a  critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful solo career  and now lives in Spain.  When he's in the United States, MacDonald lives above his parents' bar in Fish Creek, Wis., and conducts his business  from a Pizza Hut pay phone in nearby Sturgeon Bay. "I think Pat's the world's greatest lyricist - I really do,"  says Miles Copeland, the CEO of Ark 21 records, which released one of MacDonald's solo albums. "But he doesn't have two  nickels to rub together." It doesn't have to be that way. MacDonald has been offered millions of dollars for the rights to several of his songs. He's received overtures from McDonald's for "Future's So Bright  ..." and Clairol for "Hairstyles and Attitudes," among others. He has refused every proposal.  "I just vowed a long time ago that I'd never do that," MacDonald says from his parents' bar, the Bayside Tavern. "You  give up a piece of yourself. It's hard to explain to people the  feelings involved. It would make me feel dirty." MacDonald traces his disdain for advertising money back to a  mid-1980s Honda scooter ad featuring Lou Reed. "I never had the same respect for him after that," MacDonald  says. "To me, rock music was always about being contrary to the  system. It didn't fit in - that's what I liked about it."  Copeland respects MacDonald for his firm convictions, but  says that devotion to integrity has a price. "I'm now the receiving end of this integrity," explains  Copeland, who says he's lent MacDonald more than $200,000 over  the last several years. "I love Pat, but he calls me and he's  literally, literally begging for money - to save his integrity. "Now I'm thinking, what kind of integrity is that?" Copeland  continues. "When you see a beggar on the street with a sign saying 'Give me five cents,' do you look at this guy and say, 'Now there's a man of integrity'? No, you say, 'There's a  beggar.' "  ------------ Obviously MacDonald has the kind of integrity that Robert Smith wishes he had, but look how silly it is that he won't license his music. He lives above his parents' bar and begs Miles Copeland for money. Meanwhile, Lou Reed made the scooter commercial and sips tea in the West Village with Laurie Anderson, happy and advanced.   Robert Smith could learn a lot from Lou Reed. Of course, we all could.

      Willie Nelson, like Dolly Parton, is among the advanced artists who seem to be loved no matter what they do. He started out playing more or less straight country in Nashville, which he didn't care for. His career since then has been pretty odd: He's done jazz, performed a duet with Julio Iglesias, starred in a movie based on one of his albums, done a cameo in a movie about getting high, made a record to pay off his taxes (and described it as such), and made a "reggae" record. Oh, and in August he'll be playing with Bob Dylan on a 22-date tour of minor league baseball stadiums. Most people can't get away with this kind of behavior, but somehow he can. Everybody loves Willie Nelson, no matter what. This is some form of advancement, but I haven't figured out what the name should be.

      I heard a lot of people wondering why Bob Dylan would do that Victoria's Secret commercial. They were dismayed that an artist of his stature would "sell out." I don't see much difference in selling one's image to an underwear company and selling one's music to a record company. Either way, you're making a deal with the devil. And Victoria never asks, "Where's the single?"

      from rollingstone.com:  A producer in Perth, Australia...is putting together a musical based on the music of Da Bruddas. According to Michael Herrmann, who wrote the libretto, Gabba Gabba Hey is "a touching love story with colorful Lower East Side characters" set to the music of Johnny, Joey, Dee Dee and Tommy (the last of whom has signed on as musical director)  ---------------------  The Australian producer is most likely not advanced. But it is advanced for a Ramone to be involved. It would have been much more advanced if it were Joey or Dee Dee acting as musical director, which is impossible now (sadly). Of course it just may be that Tommy was the most advanced of them all. Hard to say.  Oh, and I don't think I need to remind you all of the outfits the Ramones wore.

      Yesterday, my iPod selected at random "Winner's Blues" by Sonic Youth. It is close to being advanced, but no. They just had to record the vocals with a weird effect and include a strange noise in the end! It's sort of like when Pavement had to throw in the Billy Squire lick at the end of "Range Life," just so we'll all know that Pavement knows the song is a bit sweet sounding. Oh well.

      Prague is an overt city (you know in your heart it's true), but I came across something interesting that happened during the Clinton years that I didn't know about:  (Reuters) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vice President Al Gore were among those spotted moving to the music at a state dinner for Czech President Vaclav Havel and his wife Dagmar. It was Havel's idea to have Reed appear as the entertainer for the dinner held in the White House East Room. Said President Clinton: "If you had as much fun as I did just now, you should give President Havel the credit because he said, 'I want Lou Reed to play tonight." The evening provided a welcome respite for a White House shaken by a continuing sex scandal. The Brooklyn-born Reed and his band played some of his classics, including "Sweet Jane."  After Reed played several songs, the Clintons and Havels appeared on stage with him and Havel had Reed sign a book of his songs that was recently published in Prague.  -------------------------- Apparently Havel told Lou Reed "I was president because of you." I didn't know much about the Velvet Revolution, so I did a little research and found this quote  urlLink here :  In 1968 a rare copy of the Velvet Underground’s first record somehow found its way to Prague. It became a sensation in music circles and beyond, eventually inspiring the Czech name for their bloodless 1989 overthrow of Communist rule, "the Velvet Revolution." The Plastic People, then a newly formed troupe that borrowed heavily from Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, quickly added a half-dozen songs from The Velvet Underground & Nico to their repertoire. The group was banned not long after the Prague Spring concluded but continued to play at weddings and secret shows.  -------------------------- I don't know why I haven't heard of this before.

      While on the treadmill today, I was thinking about how an advanced artist's career is a lot like mathematics. We all can understand basic math, and everyone uses it in daily life. Then math starts to become more complicated and abstract (algebra, for instance) and it's harder to understand and seems less useful. Many people start to abandon math at this point, but most are still on board. Then calculus is forced on high school students, and that is the end of the road. Yet there are some people who are thrilled by calculus and go deeper and deeper into theoretical mathematics. It might seem to an outsider that it is a waste of time to devote one's life to the obscure corners of mathematics, but that is because the deeper you go into math, the harder it is to understand. But people who do understand theoretical mathematics find a lot of beauty and meaning in it. Plus, they appreciate basic math more fully. And so it goes with the advanced artist's music. It starts out easy to understand, but it becomes more difficult as the artist advances. This alienates a lot of people, but those who stick around are rewarded by the beauty and meaning they discover in advanced music.

      I did my interview with Radio City, a station in Ecuador. They were extremely nice, and it was an interesting experience. There were two interviewers who asked me questions in English, then they translated my answer, then discussed it. It was slightly disconcerting, but I think I did a fair job of explaining the theory. Of course, the theory is pretty complicated, so I left a lot of stuff out. All in all, though, it was a positive experience. No word on whether I'll be able to provide audio. Of course, most of it is in Spanish, so I'm not sure how much good it would do.

      I don't know my metal well enough to say anything definitively, but I believe Metallica might just be an advanced heavy-metal band. I think that "Master of Puppets" is really good, and a lot of people I know are very enthusiastic about their earlier stuff. However, with stuff like "Enter Sandman," they moved into the category of "world's most evil pop band" (thanks, Britt). Of course, being a metal band, they had to have short hair, rather than long hair, to show that they had advanced. Could it be that their decision to file suits against file sharers was an advanced move?  I think they also sued someone who named a rose metallica, which was based on it's latin description (or something like that) and had nothing at all to do with the band. And now they've done a documentary about themselves, including rehab and therapy sessions (not very metal), which seems pretty advanced. But were they good enough in the beginning to qualify?  Something to think about.

      I wrote earlier about listening to albums by people that you loved in the past but stopped liking. Now I'd like to say a few things about music that you thought you never could like. I remember thinking when Stone Temple Pilots first appeared that they were the worst band in the world. They seemed embarrassingly derivative, and "Weiland" appeared to be a total fraud pretending to be weird—the worst kind of overtness. But when "Plush" came on the radio, I didn't change the station, and, in fact, I was secretly rocked by it. I realized one day that I had stopped listening to it to hate it and started genuinely enjoying it. After sheepishly admitting to a few friends that I liked the song, it turned out that they all liked it as well. I realize now that I was being an overt listener. Luckily for me, radio stations play popular songs twice an hour, so I got to a place where I enjoyed "Plush" (and a lot of other STP stuff, too).   The point is that being an advanced listener is about defying what you expect of yourself. You'd be surprised what you're capable of liking.

      I got a call from a very nice producer of Radio City, which is apparently the radio station associated with the BBC of London and "El Universo," the "biggest newspaper in Ecuador." She asked me to do an interview on a show based on "high profile interviews about art, culture, entertainment, music, life styles and more with information and interviews from around the world." I'm doing the interview tonight at 7:15, but I don't know if it will air live. Hopefully I will be able to provide a clip later.

      I'm going to be occupied most of the day, but I'll try to write later this afternoon. I've been thinking a lot about the optimistic aspects of being advanced, what it means to be an advanced fan, Metallica, rock criticism, and many other things. Hopefully I'll be getting to all that in the coming days.

      From  urlLink billboard.com :  [Frank] Black has told the Associated Press that neither fans – nor former record label 4AD – should hold their breath: "Record companies, schmecord companies – who needs ‘em? That’s not where the money is." ------------------- An overt person would say, "Record companies don't pay enough attention to art." An advanced person says, "Schmecord companies don't pay enough."

      So I've been doing a little research on Elvis, and I came across this quote from Roy Orbison in "Last Train to Memphis":  "[Elvis's] energy was incredible, his instinct was just amazing....Actually it affected me exactly the same way as when I first saw that David Lynch film ["Blue Velvet"]."  Only an advanced person would see this connection. They just see the world differently.

      Well, I'm back from my honeymoon. Thanks to my guest bloggers who had me reaching for my dictionary and a kleenex.  So here's this from the NY Post:  TWYLA Tharp, who scored a triumph last season with "Movin' Out," that great contemporary ballet set to the music of Billy Joel, has been meeting with another fabled songwriter — Bob Dylan — about fashioning a musical from his catalogue of standards.  Details are sketchy, since the project is supposed to be "top secret," says a source.  But Dylan is said to have approached Tharp after seeing "Movin' Out."  The two have met a handful of times, and Tharp has brought the project to the Nederlanders, who produced "Movin' Out."  Tharp, sources say, is giving the Nederlanders a preview of the show at her apartment next week.  The Nederlanders declined to comment on the Tharp-Dylan project.   --------------------- That Bob Dylan approached her and not the other way around is pretty advanced. If Dylan was that excited about "Movin' Out," I might have to rethink my position on Billy Joel.

      As Jason and "his lady" are away on their honeymoon frolic, I (Bob) have been invited to weigh in on Things Advanced.  And now the week's half over... so let's boogie!  One of the difficulties of Advancement Theory can be understanding the important concept of "overtness".  Novices often will identify someone or something as advanced, wherein it's actually overt.  There is a rational hermeneutic behind these ideas, which can be delineated with Hegelian rigor. But such is not my "way". No, I seem to be the "zen" guy in the Foundation. I am blessed/cursed with satori-like insights into the nature of Advancement. It's a gift.  Still, an intriguing aspect of Advancement Theory are those gray areas, where what at first seems obvious soon results in a quagmire.... Case in point: Is it advanced to release a cd with one of those extra cardboard covers surrounding the jewel box? The Lou Reed (aka "the rosetta stone") magnum opus "THE RAVEN" has such packaging, which in itself would seemingly setttle the issue.  But wait: Wilco's last two albums have the cardboard (everything on the Nonesuch label does - Can a company be advanced?), and for my money, Mr. Tweedy and gang are the current standard bearers of the "hip overt".   Ultimately, such packaging seems clearly overt to me. It signifies an "important work of art".  And look at Nonesuch, or even better, the jazz label ECM. One knows EXACTLY what an album on these labels is going to sound like, even before clawing the goddamn cardboard off....  Which brings us back to Lou Reed. Lou could play a cardboard guitar and he'd remain the ne plus ultra of Advancement. It's a gift.

      I'm getting married this Saturday, and the festivities begin tonight. I'll be away on honeymoon after that, so this will be the last post from me until I get back. I've asked a couple of members of the Advancement Foundation to guest blog at their leisure, so hopefully you can get your fill of advancement while I'm gone. I've bought "Last Train to Memphis" because I've been wanting to research Elvis's role in advancement. So you should expect a lot about Elvis when I get back. And with that, I'm off.

      Keith Richards takes a strong stance against Hitler on his  urlLink website :  "I mean that Adolph, what a piece of work, you know?" ---------------------- Apparently, Keith's house was bombed by the Germans when he was a baby, so he took a personal dislike to Hitler. London, according to Keith, was in black in white during the Battle of Britain. He says rock'n'roll brought the world into the Technocolor age. Even still, he likes black and white.   He suggests that people watch the History Channel if they want to learn more about World War II.

      So I lied about taking a break.  According to  urlLink billboard.com :  "Meat Loaf's Feb 20 and 22 performances in Melbourne are the basis for the upcoming live CD 'Bat Out of Hell Live with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra' and the DVD 'Live with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.' "  I cannot think of anything more unnecessary than a live performance of "Bat Out of Hell" with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. I also cannot think of many things more advanced. I think Jim Steinman might actually be the advanced puppet master pulling Meat Loaf's strings, but I don't know how they work.   Meat Loaf appeared in the Spice Girls' movie.

      I haven't talked about Tom Waits yet because I think it's important that people understand the theory before we enter into the category that he fits into: second-stage advanced weirdo. Britt and I have considered his case carefully, and our conclusion is that he must have started out advanced and became overt. How can this be? Well, he must have been overt before he released any music. That is the only way I can see his going from singing duets with Crystal Gayle to "Bone Machine." I like Crystal Gayle fine, but I think you know what I'm talking about. How does he go from "Looks like I'm up shit creek again" to   A murder of silhouette crows I saw And the tears on my face And the skates on the pond They spell Alice  I watched an old (very old) SNL recently, and Bette Midler performed one of his songs. She introduced it as a song written by her very good friend, Tom Waits. At that stage in their careers, they were pretty much the same (though she had her mermaids and he his lampposts) but she took the traditional route of advancement and he didn't. Of course, she was much more overt than he was, so she had to become less overt as she advanced. He had already advanced so the only path left was to become overt. If we're lucky, he'll stick around enough to be a third-stage advanced weirdo. I don't what that would sound like, but I'm guessing it probably would be something like "Likes Like I'm Up Shit Creek Again (Again)."  Talking about Tom Waits is a lot like discussing those tiny invisible dimensions that are wrapped around our three detectable dimensions. In other words, I may be right, I may be crazy, but it just may be a lunatic you're looking for.

      Nonadvanced news from Presswire:  Death Row Records has decided to move up the release date of "Live," the brand new live album by legendary artist 2Pac, to Friday, August 6th. The new album was initially scheduled for release on Tuesday, August 10th, but to avoid continued massive bootlegging, the company has decided to release the record this Friday. --------------------- This man's bones have been picked clean. Enough already. Now if they were to make a musical about his life, that would be different.

      Some advanced Lou Reed lyrics, courtesy of Britt at the Advancement Foundation:  Women  I love women, I think they're great they're a solace to the world in a terrible state They're a blessing to the eyes, a balm to soul what a nightmare to have no women in the world  I love women I love women I love women we all love women  I used to look at women in the magazines I know that it was sexist, but I was in my teens I was very bitter, all my sex was on the sly I couldn't keep my hands off women, and I won't till I die  I love women ah, I love women we love women we all love women  A woman's love can lift you up, and women can inspire I feel like buying flowers and hiring a celestial choir A choir of castratis to serenade my love they'd sing a little Bach for us and then we'd make love  I love women I love women We all love women we love women ------------------- This is truly advanced. What I like is that it is such an obvious thing to say--"I love women"--yet it's deceptively profound. It's  sort of like "I Can't Get No (Satisfaction)" in that way. Now, the castratis are a bit unnerving, but all in all, a spectacular advanced effort.

      According to  urlLink this , Richie Stotts (formerly of the Plasmatics) has written four songs with Canadian adult-contemporary singer-songwriter Carla Lother. Apparently Stotts no longer has his old mohawk, which is the most overt hairstyle of them all (unless worn by an advanced artist). The Plasmatics were known for blowing up TVs and driving buses off cliffs, whereas Lother has done "numerous jingles for the likes of Maxwell House and MasterCard." He said when he first saw her play that "it was a great show, but her music was...Celtic-influenced." Since leaving the Plasmatics, he went back to school and got a degree in geology and now works at "the computer department of a Wall Street financial firm."  Let's see: he went from punk to adult contemporary, embrace the World Beat, and is an IT guy on Wall Street. I believe this gentleman is advanced.
