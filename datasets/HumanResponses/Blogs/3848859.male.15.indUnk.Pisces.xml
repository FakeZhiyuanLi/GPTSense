      Harder rock, the Venaculas are from Omaha, Nebraska, and are loved and cherished by people all over Nebraska. Venaculas' music is very hard to explain, for although it is harder rock, it doesn't hold the repetitiveness that a lot of metal holds, and because of that, I believe they belong in almost a Punk Metal genre... or maybe Alternative Emo?  Lol.  Their music is strikinginly... beautiful.  Listening to them, they take control of the muscles in your body and you find yourself bobbing your head to every beat.  With 2 vocalists and AWESOME guitarists... you gotta check them out.  there is free music samples at www.venaculas.com and a few full songs at...  urlLink here   man if you are a rock fan, and you don't like these guys, there is something seriously wrong with you

       Hello you, and thanks for reading this...      It has gotten to the point where I want to do very little.  Nothing seems like it's worth doing.  "It's just one of those days, you don't wanna wake up; everything is fucked and everybody sucks!" - Limp Bizkit.  Only it's like that EVERYday.  Everyone backstabs.  Everyone but maybe 1 guy that I know who wouldn't do it.  Everyone else talks to you and makes plans with you, then goes 5 feet and talks shit on you.     The sad thing is, I'm no different.  I'm not nearly as bad, and I've been improving a lot, but for the most part, I'm just as disloyal as everyone else.  The only two people I have any real motivation not to backstab is my best guy friend, and Aimee, the girl I just for some reason can't get out of my head.     Right now, it seems like the only thing that can redeem me would be seeing Aimee.  Is that wrong to put that much pressure on someone?  I don't want her to do things just because she feels bad for me.  But the truth is, she is the only real person I can trust.  She is the only real person period.  Everyone else is fake and they don't even know themselves.  Does that make any sense what-so-ever?    You may be thinking I'm a really negative person, but I'm really not.  I just kind of... quit caring. For example:     You eat a meal that makes you tanner, removes acne, makes you 'sexier', makes you richer, completely fulfills all your vitamin needs, completely fills you up, and is the best tasting thing you've ever aten in your life... are you ever going to want to eat anything else?    Basically, once you expirience the best, you don't want anything else.  If you know you'll never expirience the best again, it's easier to move on.  But what if you're unsure?  What if it's a maybe?  What if you get little bites of that meal here and there?  It is going to keep you hooked.    What I'm trying to get at is that Aimee was the best friend I ever had, for she stuck with me, and she was just... perfect.  She improved my life so much, and besides that... I just loved her!  And no matter what I just can't get over her.  It's not an obsession, because if not talking to me makes her happy, than I don't want her to talk to me.  It's not about  me , it's about  her .  It doesn't help that I just recently, out of jealousy, pretty much called her a slut to her face last night.  That was me and my selfish jealousy fucking up again.  Up untill then, things had been going really good!       Anyway... I don't what to do anymore so I'm going to sleep.  Sleep. sleep. sleep.  I've just got to constantly pound into my head unnatural feelings of not caring, not wanting to care, and not even thinking of caring.    I've got Zero Motivation, and I need SOME kind of Medication.  Wether it be drugs, girls, a new friend, sleep, or what.  But I need something to take away this desire so I can get my motivation back for other things. Wouldn't it be nice if everything just worked out how you want it to?  If I could just have the thing I wanted most.  Too bad  nothing   ever  works out that way. ---I'll leave you at that.  Thanks, please comment.

       Hello...  Hello to whoever decided to randomly read my blog. I guess I'm doing this to vent, and maybe figure myself out in the process.      Well, I'm JD Pierce (Justin Dwayne Pierce) from Blair, Nebraska, which is a small town of about 8000 people just north of Omaha, Nebraska.  I was adopted at a young age of about 3 months, and for those of you who aren't adopted, it affects my life in no way what-so-ever.  (At least that's what I  think .)  I have little to no desire to meet my real parents, except for when I feel like running away to another home...     I'm a junior in highschool as of now, but I'm only 15.  This is because I skipped 4th grade, but as of now I'm no longer worth of the title "good student".  After I hit highschool motivation just kind of went downhill you know?  It's kind of ironic actually, because all of the high ability learners at Blair Highscool (me being one of them), are all slackers and everything but good students, and by looking at them, you'd never guess they were "smart", for we don't sport the classic nerdy look.  In fact, the "smart" group and the "stoner" group kind of merged into one here... what does that tell you about drugs?     Before you quit reading because you're a prick and I suggested that I might smoke pot, let me tell you this:  I quit.  Yeah... as of about May 2004, I quit smoking, simply because I... well... actually I don't know why I quit.  I'll have to think about that one.  Anyway, I have an extremely boring childhood, for I live out in the country, and have lived here my whole life, and never had any real childhood friends.  People began to discover who I was once they started hearing about a youngen who skipped a grade, but holds awesome parties and does crazy shit.     As of 8th grade my "smartness" had met it's doom.  Hormones came, girls became hott... and I met my personal devil to sit on my shoulder.  His name was Andrew Ronning, and he became a good friend of mine, as well as my teacher of all things bad.  Through-out the course of the year, he introduced me to alcohol, pot, and gave me several lessons on female anatomy.     I made the majority of my friends this year... and when I went into highschool, all of them changed, with Andrew being one of the only friends I kept.  I got even more into partying, and began to host a few, as well as become more known through-out Blair, as my status rose.  I loved it.  I loved people inviting me to parties knowing I'm the heart of some parties, because I was just... crazy.  I loved people knowing who I was, because at that time, to me, status really mattered... Sad?  You be the judge.     Things continued like that for a while, with girls not really coming into the picture.  When sophmore year rolled around, one girl did.  At the time I thought it was a blessing, but it was actually to be my downfall.  The first semester of my sophmore year was my pinnacle.  I had finally met who would be my main group of friends for the rest of highschool, and man did we make some memories.  I had some of the funnest moments of my life with that small group of people...  To me, everything was perfect.  A girl I cared about, but who didn't have a hold of me, awesome parties almost everyday, and a good group of close friends....     But for every good moment you have, you must have a bad one...  finally, after all my glorious moments and fun, something finally went wrong.  Towards the end of 1st semester, that girl I cared about (Alyssa Fatte for those of you who know me) got extremely sick from drinking at one of my parties, and I ended up taking her to the hospital and getting MIP (Minor in Possesion of Alcohol).  For most of my friends, this wouldn't be a big deal, because their parents really couldn't care less.  I'm different.  I think it is because I'm adopted, and they don't want to "lose me", but whatever the case, my parents are 100% complete overprotective Nazis.  All along they had no idea what-so-ever that I was a partier, so I didn't have to try to hide anything.  But now, I was screwed.  They never would again trust me fully.     Ever since then, through-out 2nd semester, my friends all eventually got caught and put on prohabation, and my relationship with Alyssa, my family, and my friends was fading.  I repeatedly got caught, because I had an illusion in my head that made me think I could still get away with things...     One major thing happened 2nd semester that may have changed me forever.  One of the stupid little freshman girls who had been dating one of my good friends from that whole group of people somehow got a hold of my heart.  It was wierd, because out of no where, on the last day of 1st semester, she gave me a kiss on the cheek and told me to call her.  Maybe she thought I was cute... I don't know... I don't know how their minds work.  So I randomly call her, and she doesn't remember telling me to call her, but nonetheless, we talk for hours and hours on end every night, as I am grounded off my ass, and am in fact staying with my cousin, because I had gotten kicked out of the house.  One night we really wanted to see each other, so I snuck out and my old group of friends and her came and picked me up.  Immediately when I got into the jeep, we began making out, without even saying a word.  We dropped her off soon after, for she had to go home.  We all smoked a few bowls, and returned to my cousin's house to drop me off.     When we returned, the cops were there waiting for us, and to make a long story short, I got Possesion of Less Than 1 Ounce, and a few other drug charges.  That was the end of my friends for a long time.     I soon found out that I wasn't the only person Aimee (that freshman girl) had made out with that day, and that made me pretty angry.  I was completely cut off from the phone, and all communication to the outside.  So... Aimee wrote me a letter.  I think this is why I decided to ask her out.  That, and she pretty much convinced my parents to not make me go to an all guys private catholic high school.  Oh god that would have sucked.     When my 'rents loosened up on my grounding, I asked Aimee out, and she said yes.  It hurts to talk about it, but over the course of 5 to 6 months, we became  extremely  close.  We were attached at the hip and did EVERYTHING together, and we expressed our love for eachother a LOT.  We ended up loosing our virginity to eachother, and that wasn't the last time we did that...     We broke up in May, after we just got too jealous and overprotective of each other.  It was suppost to be a 'break', but 2 months passed by quickly.  Within these two months, I pretty much gained all my friends back, but most of us had quit weed.  We began to party again, and everything was going good... or at least that's what I acted like.     It is July, and I still love that girl with all my heart.  There is nothing I wouldn't do to get her back.  Everyonce in a while we'll get close again and it'll look like we're gonna date again, but I fuck up out of jealousy, and make her really angry, and then we just have to start over.  I can't enjoy anything any more, I always feel sick in my stomach, and nothing appeals to me any more.  I'm always an asshole to my parents now, lol but sometimes it seems like they deserve it.  Trust me, every bone in my body wants to get over her, but I just can't do it.  I want her to be happy, and I want to show her my love.  I don't want to fuck up... and I know if I just be myself I won't.  I'm working on it.    That is pretty much my life up to date.  I try to replace Aimee her with other girls, but it just doesn't work that way.  Meanwhile, I just continue on with my daily life of random parties, etc.  Not much important happens anymore really.  I don't know what the hell it is, but everything is so boring, and I just hope it solves itself soon.  I really care for that girl, and I really really miss her! ---I'll leave at that. EDIT:  One more thing, 311 fucking rocks!  Last one I went to w/ Nate was sweet!  There is one coming up the 16th at memorial park and it's free!  GO THURR!

      It's about 12:45 and i just woke up... and I think i'm going to do absolutely nothing, and make no effort to do anything.  I'm just gonna lay here and see if my friend calls and maybe go somewhere then.  I'm really indifferent to wether he calls or not... if he does, I'll be social and go have fun and get my mind of how pissed Aims is with me.  If he doesn't, I'll just sleep and eat. I've been trying to call one of my other friends-that-is-a-girl that I usually wouldn't talk to, but I'm in desperate need to vent to someone who might understand me.  Man, this particular girl I've treated so bad over the last year... and I feel really bad too.  Hopefully we can get our friendship up and running again, and seeing as how she has a lot of enemies in highschool, it'll give me an excuse to stand up for someone.  Know what I mean?  It always feels good to tell the ass holes of our school to shut the fuck up.  And being friends with her, I'd have an excuse to do that. Anyway... no promises on how sober I'll stay today... ha.  ....later that day....      Well after getting over the shock that a girl I like a lot might be dating someone who said they would never date her... I go over to his house, and he says that he in fact, isn't dating her.  What is going on????  Wow it's just one big game of jealousy...      So I hung out with a girl I haven't hung out with for a longgggg time... Alyssa... and surprisingly, I had a good time.  I remembered what life was like before I really cared about girls too much.  We just hung out in Lakeland (a small residential area out in the country), and Alyssa tried to get Aimee to come out, but she refused.  (And, contrary to popular belief, I was TOTALLY against the idea of Aimee coming out, cuz at this moment I knew it'd be nothing but trouble!)     Well, I'm thoroughly surprised by how much fun I had with Alyssa, but nonetheless, I still thought about a certain someone, and everyonce in a while, I struggled with that... I hung out with her sisters for god sakes!  But she won't even hang with me.  I had a lot of fun on the little motor powered scooter though.  :D haha those are vicious.     Anyway, if you read this Alyssa, thanks for being one of the few people who are able to get my mind of a certain things.  I could really see us being good friends. If you read this Aims, I hope we get everything figured out soon... I miss ya. ---I'm out everyone, thanks for spending the time to read this.

          I woke up at about 5:30 (yes, 5:30  A.M.  people) and traveled almost an hour to get to work this morning.  Work day wasn't too horrible or too long, but I know it will be tommorow.  *sigh*  I didn't really do crap today besides that.  I just worked on a little project thingy on my computer, and waited for someone to call.     I coulda went and hung out, but, I just didn't feel up to it.  I dunno.  There is someone in particular who I really want to hear from that no one has heard from at all today.  I miss them, and it's only been a day!  Oh well.  I dunno what to do anymore.  I just wanna do nothing... I wanna talk to the person I miss so much.    I just don't know how this is going to end up!... oh and while I'm complaining, a few people who I thought were my friends don't really seem to care too much.  In addition to missing 1 person a ton already, it doesn't help that no calls to talk at all...  ---well i'll cut-off my complaining here... cya all later.  go to church!
