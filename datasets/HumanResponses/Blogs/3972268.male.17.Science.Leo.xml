						   Time for my big vacation! It's really cheered me up, now that we're about to go. I just can't wait to go back to my home town! California here I come if you pardon the old phrase :)

						   Why is it me?  Why does it hurt?  my heart would sing,  I had the world   Do I have a chance?  Do I have a Hope,  of being with her,  the answer's nope   what hope I have,  I cling to still,  my heart is dead,  my heart is still,   I wish tonight,  With all my soul,  to have her still,  The one I wish to hold   &nbsp; ok....I'm feeling horrible right now. Ever had the feeling you lost your insides suddenly? How it feels to see something you held dear seem to just float away? If I'm not feeling that now I've got something wrong with me. The story is as simple as it get but it's way to complicated for me. Boy meets girl, falls in love, finally tells her, after awhile she tells she likes another, Boy gets over it hoping there's a chance, Boy's put into his place and feels like jumping off a cliff.&nbsp; O_o what a day.....and it's not even noon time yet.

						   &nbsp;-_- *sigh* if being bored was fog, you could cut it with a knife right now. Boy has this been an uneventful day. I did finish some work on a dragon I'm making but other then that it's just been one long day with nothing to do. Yeah, I'm sure there's SOMETHING I could be doing but that'd probably be either chore or something I don't feel like doing. Figures, I hate it when that happens......AND I STILL CAN'T FIND ANY DECENT SOAP! ARG! WHERE IS ALL THE SOAP!

						   Well, fate has been kind to me lately. I've gotten passing in all my APs, a 4 and a 5, so now I have 12hr. all together in Colledge credit, whipppy! I've made some progress in a project I've been working on for some time too. I need to start my exersising soon though, I do it now and then but I'll need the endurance for my riggerous trip to San Diego. I do have to remember one thing.....SOAP! must remember soap. I've got to get my hands on it or I'm doomed(exaggeratoin).*begins searching everywhere for soap bars*

						   Hm....well. Things havn't been doing the best lately. Yesterday I was EXTREMELY depressed, mostly about fate and all that stupid stuff like that. It's nice having a&nbsp;close friend, she helped me through it. Other then that not much else has come up, just drawing some various stuff and all.

						   &nbsp;Yello people! This is my introductory post so don't expect anything extravagant :P. Nothing much has been going on lately other then my impending graduation(I'm a senior this year in high school so next summer I'm free of it!). I've certainly had a busy and...Ahem..slightly hard and painful summer...Cough..Cough.. but it's shaping up to be a good one, what with a trip to San Diego, CA coming up fast. I know it's a crappy poem..but I thought it up for someone...who obviously'll know who's it too when they see it :)    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart was torn asunder,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and we went our separate ways,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but forever more,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in my heart you'll stay.    &nbsp;  Adios muchachos! Must be off to my chores/internet surfing

						   +_+ Blech, first day back and they sure don't give you any slack in seinor year...sure it's not all bad but.... +_+ Uye! *sigh* well I'm off to school again, almost dreading what's going to happen next! All day yesterday I was bombarded with little acidents and of course the usual, You weren't here and missed something lecture. You'd think they'd have gotten sick of talking about that by now.... Kally wasn't on yesterday either... I really wish she was, I needed someone to talk to...although the way my days are going I'll need her even more today +_+ ! Well....wish me luck, I'll need it this year ; _ ;
