      i have found my fingers are cramping from shoving them in ppls holes, i mean, they are cramping because today has been the most exciting day of my life.  I have sat on my two buttocks or if u like to be dirty my ass for the longest time in my poor life.  Since 8am to 10pm right now, i have got up for 4 reasons, pissing, eating, get a cd, and to answer the phone to a god damn telemarket sales representative.  Them bastards always trying to get me to try out their new breast growth cream, with free shipping...maybe one day one day, i will buy from them and tell them it made my man boobs smaller, just so they can stop calling ppl all around the world and in Africa, no wonder new diseases come up.  Aids, polio vaccine, infected, not pure, Belgium scientists, poor ppl.  Why do kids sing the black plague song...  Aquafina is not pure...  I have tennis yet for another week, making this my forth week. Last saturday i won two of the tournaments i entered. Won = plastic fake gold trophies omfg grass is green.  Got 1st in 18 and under singles, and 2nd in intermediate.  Had to face this kemp lolly or something, i can't remember he was good, hits those balls hard.  Lol when he double faulted he said oh u balls aren't nice, well kemp tennis balls dont have feelings, unless u like balls inside u...than they may give u a feeling....jons poop smells like shit, shit that has rotted for 13 years in a hobos pants...thx tom, im out, im tired and cool my cell phone is ringing.  Ultima  And the counterstrike players ruled the world once and for all

      As i am typing this message to let u know, if u care which u dont so read it anyways because this will make u more bored, i am typing this 10 minutes b4 i have to leave, so ya eat a.. Well i haven't posted on here for a bit now and i dont really care but i forgot that maybe there is one person in the world that loves my posting and is in a wheelchair because they paralyzed themself over..wait wait wait, nvm there is nobody in the world that cares bout me posting. I have tennis in 9 minutes and i still have to brush my teeth, take a piss in my toilet, and put on my shoes and pack my lunch, and have another boring day of smack the green fuzzy thing at people.  Even tho that hot girl is there, everything is boring.  Since me and the hot girl and my friend drew are the only advanced players out of 12 people, we have to do mental tennis this week.  We have to keep our chin up, racket above waste, and when we mess up, we have to get down on the ground and yell why god and fix 3 strings the girth of my penis.  If we fail to do these, we have to run a lap around the courts not that big of a deal, but when ur in humid hot no wind weather, 6 laps can start to pain u. I have 6 minutes and im finishing here, my grandpa, yes grandpa not pa, gpa, Opa, papa, somethign christian like that, its grandpa u fucktards is going to pick me up than lick my butthole if i dont hurry, its called a rimjob or a salad toss, and personally i dont know about u guys, but personally i dont like wrinkly faces with warted tongues on or near my body.  Im going.... going... "lame" poof

      Today has been a so-so day.  Yesterday night i found out one of my close friends had a guy who didn't want a relationship and was making a big deal about it, the stupid fucktard relationship in ur teens...wow.  Anyways that made me kinda happy b/c girls have the same mind set as me they just want to have fun, use your imagination ppl.  Hardees burgers rock my world #1 no pickels no onions with curls fries and a md.  I have had that order for 5 days now..hmmm.. its like food porn.  My buddy Jon came over Saturday and we did nothing well i played games he watched tv, but the day after we went swimming and it was great I saw a cat.  He left this morning for North Carolina with his three brothers, Stephen and Tom.  Sprint was mad at Tom I think.  thesprint.blogspot.com is his blogger site.    Does anybody like the game called DDR?  Ppl say it is for fags but hell it gives you a work out and its probably the only game that doesn't let you sit on ur ass and eat cookies like i am doing right now....I just went and got the mail and i am all wet, damn clouds.     Today at tennis another girl was there and god damn she is fucking hot.  She has no boobs but i dont care, i dont care about boob size, call me weird and i will say ok.  Her and coach were talking and she commented on how her ex ex ex ex boyfriend wanted to talk with her again, and thus coach said if i would be her boyfriend :/ for the day.  The guy was punier than me and she didn't disagree with coach saying that, i wonder what that means.  She won't be there tomorrow she has to work but she will be there for wednesday through friday :):):):) god i have no life, later. IM going to LiSTEN to my crystal method.  Sprint sprint sprint...sprint

      Wow i found out this site from sprint and reading his very very interesting posts. So i decided in my boredom state that i am in right now to type up a user account and specify what my thoughts are this very damn second.  HOLY SHIT BACON IS THE BEST THING SINCE MY GMAS PANCAKES! This is very good bacon so crisp and I'm in here eating bacon listening to crystal method.  I just got back from my good friend Jon's house and my other good friend shane was over there too.  We went outside for a bit but it seems that we shouldn't have gone outside because while we were outsidex3 it seems we had ppl getting on to our accounts and my other good friend talor's account and fucking around with a good friend chelsey.  Now all the good friends are connected and friends also together, worded that right ;) who gives a shit.. but anyways chelsey did not have a good night and neither did we, we got blamed like most americans would, but hell if i was in chelseys shoes i would blame us too, because this person who we think we know who was fucking around with ppl acted like us.  Acted like me, me being the retarded, fag, stupid low-life with no love life, spending my time at the computer and reading bombs and playing counterstrike, what a life, not talking on msn as much and blah blah blah fuck me sideways im gay.  Um ya, we came back inside and no one was at the computer but ppl were all pissed at us, yes it started at one person and i think it spreaded like gonerrhea to other ppl, god damn STD that is why u fuck only ppl u know who dont have stds u dumbasses.  So my good friend shane talked things out and it seems they dont hate us anymore, which is what it should've been anyways, we didn't do anything so...  ya..   New paragraph.  The incoming freshmen into Joplin High School should be better than what it was last year, since i was a freshmen last year, my year of ppl suck balls.  They are annoying, stuck up pricks, that should be melted in shit.  I hate them.  Not all but most, and the upper classmen r the same way.  But hell it is all good in the hood, LOL no... and maybe sarah does hate certain koreans.  I get my hair cut today half and inch just to make it even, its like sprints it curls when it gets to a certain point.  We must be related sprint..donedonedone, cry sprint. no seriously cry... bastard..im giong to go im talking of pointless stuff because life is pointless at some points like this time frame of day that i am in.. later
