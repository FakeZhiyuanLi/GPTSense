       Perhaps the most difficult aspect of playing the didgeridoo is circular breathing. This involves blowing into the instrument's mouthpiece with your mouth while frequently taking sniffs of air through your nose. The trick is continuing this process in such a way as to produce a continuous drone. Though I've been playing didgeridoo for a few years, I still have not completely mastered circular breathing. Some people practice this technique by blowing bubbles through a straw into a glass of water. One teacher compares circular breathing to chewing a piece of steak--only this time there is no real piece of meat on which to chew--only a mouthful of air. At any rate, keep your cheeks relaxed and loose when you play the didge.  Begin with a basic drone. You can accomplish this by buzzing your lips--sort of like a bronx cheer or raspberry. Some people might laugh and say the sound resembles a rude noise--but I leave that to imagination. You might want to hold the didgeridoo in such a way that you are blowing into it at an angle, rather than straight on. Don't blast out mouthfuls of air, as if you are blowing into a horn--that wastes air and makes your instrument sound like a horn or perhaps a charging elephant. Gradually let out the air, thus producing a low drone or buzz.  Once you are comfortable with a basic drone, try adding animal noises. You can even talk into the instrument, saying such things as "didgeridoo" (the English term for the instrument), as well other words. The didge may also be used as a rhythm instrument. Rather than one long continuous drone, try a series of grunts and barks--thus imitating a drum. Though the didge is a primitive instrument, it is quite versatile and may be used as accompaniment for different styles of music, including jazz, blues, "New Age," etc.

       The didgeridoos I've made are between one and a quarter and two inches in inner diameter as well as being three and a half and six feet long. Speaking for myself, the easiest ones to play are of the smaller diameters and lengths.  A cardboad didge is easiest to make because cardboard is so plentiful. You may obtain the cardboard tubes from giftwrap boxes, as well as carpets. You might end up compromising in terms of length--some tubes are only three feet long. Such models still give an impressive, though high, drone. Since cardboard may get waterlogged, you may wish to preserve your didge by coating it with shellac or varnish--inside as well as outside, if at all possible. You may also wish to decorate the instrument, using acrylic paints.  Another simple digeridoo can be made from a shag stick, typically used to pick up and store golf balls. An instrument of this kind comes with the mouthpiece intact: just blow into the middle of the rubber grommet. I cover my shag stick didge with electrician's tape, as well as packaging an duct tape.  PVC is also useful for making didgeridoos. Although I've used both plumbing and electrical PVC, white plumbing pipe (Schedule 40 irrigation, specifically for hotwater) is probably the best bet, being the least toxic. Some people bend and twist their didges into different shapes. The advantage is, such instruments are easier to carry and store. A heat gun (typically used to melt away old paint) is useful, as long as the setting is the lowest, 750 degrees, rather than highest (1000 degrees).  Be sure all rough spots, splinters and grit have been sanded away. The best way to use sandpaper in this instance is to wet it, thus allowing PVC dust to cling to it, rather than fly around. Better yet, consider sanding the PVC with the pipe submerged in water.  If you are lucky enough to live in an area where bamboo is plentiful, you have an excellent source of didgeridoos. Probably the best bet is to harvest the deadwood, rather than cut away live shoots (unless bamboo, itself a type of grass, is a nuisance in your area). Bamboo may be preserved by drying it out (curing). Sometimes, direct sunlight for a number of days, is helpful here. Other methods include storage in an enclosed area for long durations or applying direct heat (such as with a heat gun). If you make didges from bamboo, once again--beware of rough edges, points and splinters. The advantage of bamboo is you can burn designs into the wood, as well as paint it with acrylics. Although I've made bamboo didgeridoos from fallen bamboo shoots, some of my better models are made from poles, such as those used as garden ornaments and clothes racks. These have already been varnished, so all I need do is hollow out the insides with a few pokes from a metal rod.  If you have a Home Depot or similar home improvement store nearby, you may want to consider making a didge from outer cove molding. Molding of this variety is curved on one side. Four pieces glued together form an octahedral tube with an inner opening of about one and five eighths inches in diameter. Since this kind of molding comes in sixteen-foot lengths, the resulting didgeridoo is about four feet long.  Personally, I used TightBond II (TM) to fasten the pieces together. You can either paint your model or cover it with tape.   Clay didgeridoos are projects in and of themselves. You may form a number of small sections and fasten them together, with a stick to maintain the hollowness of the resulting tube, or resort to using an extruder. I recommend checking out sites including  urlLink www.burntearthworks.com  or running a search for clay didgeridoos for detailed instructions.  Forming a beeswax mouthpiece is fairly simple. You may obtain beeswax from hardware stores, since beeswax is commonly used to lubricate bolts. Beeswax candles are also good sources of the material. Pinch off small balls of beeswax and warm them in your hands before pressing them onto one end of your didgeridoo. Alternatively, form a wax snake and press that gently, yet firmly, around the rim.

       The digeridoo is a primitive instrument. At the same time, it is amazing the sorts of materials you can use to make one. I neglected to mention cardboard tubing, as well as alternatives to bamboo, such as agave and gourds. No matter what instrument you make, whether didgeridoo, bugle or something else, use what you have available.  A few words about safety: You may have reservations about some materials, especially PVC. The fumes are noxious, as as well as highly toxic. PVC dust is the sort you would not want to inhale, even accidentally. Also, PVC itself is highly flammable. If you make a didgeridoo from plastic, be sure you do so in a well ventilated area.  Safety concerns also extend to making digeridoos from other materials. Be careful of sawdust, splinters and sharp edges. In the case of clay, fine dust particles create their own hazards.  Although some didges have mouthpieces, I've known a few which do not. The beeswax mouthpiece basically cushions the mouth; soft wax accomodates the mouth of the individual player. I've known of alternative mouthpieces made from plastic, wood or latex (specifically, rubber).

       The didgeridoo (digeridoo/dijeridu/other alternative spellings) is sometimes referred to as the Australian trumpet. For all the similarities between the two instruments, there are plenty of differences. The didgeridoo is traditionally made from wood (eucalyptus or bamboo) rather than metal and has no valves, per se. Then again, one buzzes the lips while holding his/her mouth against the mouthpiece in the case of both instruments. Let's consider the didgeridoo in its own right. This instrument, also known as the yidaki, among other Australian aboriginal names, consists of a hollowed out tree, about three and a half to six or more feet long. Some digeridoos have mouthpieces made from beeswax. Speaking personally, I've made didges (short for didgeridoos) from clay, PVC, plastic tubing (eg for pool vacuum cleaner hoses), bamboo and wood (specifically, outer cove molding). There are also didges available made from pyrex or metal, though I have yet to see such instruments in person.  Making PVC didges can be quite an adventure. I've thought nothing of visiting a local Home Depot, zeroing in on the Plumbing section (specifically the shelves with PVC pipe) and transforming a ten-foot length of Schedule 40 Irrigation (hot water) pipe into a makeshift didgeridoo. The resulting sounds startle and amuse passersby, much to my satisfaction. Likewise my attempts using metal pipes attached to painting platforms. No doubt, you'd have to see this situation to believe it.

       This particular hosaphone is made with clear plastic hose. You might want to try a hose (or tubing) made from a different kind of material, such as latex. Also, experiment with different lengths of hose. Also, a trumpet mouthpiece may be substituted for the brass garden hose attachment. Play the hosaphone by pursing your lips and blowing through them, sort of as you would emit a bronx cheer or raspberry. You might also notice that you can produce different notes, depending on how you position your mouth in relation to the mouthpiece. NB: this is the only representative of the brass instrument family I have in my collection. Perhaps some people can think of variations, such as hosaphones with valves, similar to the trumpet.

       Here's an example of a musical instrument which is hardly original. This particular instrument is described in a couple of books, as well as on a website. It is a simple bugle, made from a length of plastic hose, a funnel and a brass garden hose attachment, all taped together. Another name for this "bugle" is hosaphone. I've discovered the instrument has a limited range but is fun to play, anyhow.

       Hi. I'm Jonjb. This site pertains to simple folk instruments you can make yourself. I made a whole slew of flutes, drums and the like and would like to share my knowledge about how I made them. I already have two websites, one of which concentrates on this subject. The other has a special section. Actually, one sit e is an outgrowth of the other. The first site is at  urlLink http://www.geocities.com/jonjb.geo/  The other is at  urlLink http://www.geocities.com/jonjb2a/   If you want to get the nitty gritty of musicbyyou, please visit the second site first. The first site has a bunch of poetry, cartoons and what I hope passes for humor (including a parody of Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet").  Meanwhile, I hope to post photos and sound clips on musicbyyou. Hopefully they will serve as inspiration. Making these instruments is not all that difficult and you may use materials commonly found around the house and even outside (such as fallen twigs and branches). Most require hand tools, rather than power tools.  With hopefully a minimum of effort, you can make music in almost no time at all.
