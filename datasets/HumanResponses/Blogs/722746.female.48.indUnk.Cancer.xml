      Hi! Here it is Sunday evening.  Dave is resting on the couch and watching some boring western!  That's ok because it gives me some time on line.  I must say when I first heard mom talk about her web-log, i.e.,  blog, I thought, "Why would anybody want to put personal stuff on line for the world to read?"  I still kind of wonder that, but I think I'm hooked.  Janice called it her therapy.  I guess I can understand that.  I suppose if people don't know me and they happen upon my blog, they will most likely be bored!  Maybe even people I know will be bored!    Yesterday after a day spent on the lake, we enjoyed a hotdog and brat cook-out and lots of laughs around the campfire.  We got home a little late and I was too tired to even check my email.  It was a good day though. Today we sort of took it easy.  I did laundry, but since I have to turn off the ac to run the drier I spread it out all day.  That way the air was never off for more than 50 mins at a time.  The house stayed pretty cool.  Dave put the headliner in the Pontiac and did some other work on it.  The 'ole care is looking pretty good.  It has been a quiet day and restful.  I think that's what Sundays are for.  Signing off for now!

      Hi!  I'm baaaaack!!!! I tried to find Darrell and Dar's place this morning, but to no avail.  Oh well, I came home and cut some more grass.  I'm not doing the back yard until later in the week.  It gets soo much sun that even though we've recently had rain the back yard is already sort of dried up.  Dave's back and we are going out on Sanford Lake later, (in about an hour to be exact!)  It's so hard to do stuff outdoors in this heat!  I mean mowing lawn on a riding mower is not hard work at all.  I'm not bagging it, so it is super easy, BUT!! I'm sweatin' like a pig out there!  Yes, I use sun screen, don't want any skin cancer creeping up on me.  I thought I'd check mail and update my blog site, but I'm headed for the shower!    Alex, I read your blog.  I agree, it is nice with the air on on days like today!  I like the fresh air too, but on a day like today it is nice to come in and cool off!  See everyone later!

      Thanks Mom!  I sort of figured it out!  HAHAHA!  I managed to change my name but the "$" shows up.  When I take the dollar sign out I loose my name!  Go figure!  Anyway, it's better than having my full name on.  Today I cut some grass, but not much.  I just did the side of the yard where the horse shoe pits are.  I'll either finish tomorrow or Monday.  I packed the camper because Dave is over at Darrell and Dar's property.  We were going to camp there for the weekend so I was going to join him tomorrow morning, but it's so hot they are thinking of coming back early tomorrow and spending some time at the lake.  I'm all for that!  Darrell and Dar recently bought some property near our house.  They are planning on putting a mobile home on the land sometime in the near future.  The people we canoe with and play cards with all went up this evening to help Darrell with something.  I'm not sure what, anyway, I stayed back to attend Patti's home and garden party.  We had a good time and her cake was absolutely delicious, and low cal.!  What a deal!  Now I"m working on my blog.  I'm not sure if I'll have an interesting enough life to update this daily, but I'll try.  Also, if we are gone for the weekend I'll miss some dates.  Well, that's about all for now.  I need to play with this some more so I can get some links added to my page.  I also want to change my look.  I need to figure that all out, so I'm signing out for now!

      Ok, I tried to start this last night.  Maybe I was too tired, but I thought I had one going, but when I tried to go to that shortcut, I kept getting the page was not available.  Anyway, here I am again.  I seem to be able to find my stuff, but not what I did first thing this afternoon, or what I did last night!  I told you it would be rambling! HAHAHA.  I guess that's what I'm doing.  Mom, Nat, and Janice convinced me this is something I should do.  I'm going to make a funny one under the name of my beloved!  Look for it soon.  We don't have pets, so I can't do that point of view!  See you all soon!

      As you may have already read in Nat's blog, there is hope for our school!  Please continue to say your prayers!  The finance committee sounded like they really wanted to close the school down, but there were many members of the parish who are really fighting for us.  If the appropriate changes are made, and the school runs for another year, I will stay.  I will not work for Johnna.  I am sure that if she is not let go the school will not open anyway.  I spoke out at this meeting, and I threw caution to the wind where Johnna was concerned.  Three of the teachers on our staff thanked me for speaking what was also on their minds.  Many parents, past and present, came up to me after the meeting to talk to me.  I am convinced the people of the community now see me as a respected teacher of the school.    On another note:  I finished the sampler for JacLynn.  The good news is, Melissa is pregnant again.  She said this would be her last child.  She is not going to find out before the birth the gender of the child.  That is fine with me, as I know someone who was misinformed!  It was actually pretty funny!  Anyway, we are very happy for Melissa and Jeremy.  Nick has been spending weekends here working on his car.  He must like to do body work, because the is the 2nd car he is fixing up!  Well, it keeps him out of trouble, and he is being very respectful to me.    Over and Out!

      Greetings!  We are not walking in the road race tomorrow.  That's ok, because I am still trying to do some activity each day.  Sometimes I ride my bike, sometimes I walk, and sometimes I do an excercise video.  I try to do between 40 mins and an hour each day.    Maggie and Brian came over for dinner tonight.  For those of you who don't know, Maggie is the person who let me borrow her car when the Lincoln broke down.  We were going to take them out, but Maggie said she was really looking forward to a delicious chicken dinner.  We had chicken, baked potato, salad, and ice cream with fresh blueberries and raspberries.  Quite a yummy dinner!  After dinner we play horse-shoes and then when the rain started we play a new card game called hand & foot.  It was a good time.  Nick is over again working on his car.  He bought an Eclipse and is putting a body kit on it.  When he is finished with the body work he plans to paint it a bright orange.  It should be interesting!  We think he likes coming over to work, because he gets free dinners!  HAHAHA!  I did not think he would have so much work because the parts he is putting on the car are new, but he has been here 3 weekends already, and he thinks he needs 1 or 2 more.  It's ok though.  He has matured, and is quite friendly.    Tomorrow will be a good laundry day!  I should finish with my sampler for JacLynn soon also.  I'm almost done with the backstitching.    Over and Out!

      We might not walk in the road race on the weekend, which I believe is Sun, not Sat, as I posted yesterday.  We will continue to walk in the evenings though.    Today we received some sad news about our school.  We may have to close our doors.  That is really too bad.  St. Josaphat's has been a part of the Carrollton community for almost 90 years!  We are having a last ditch effort meeting on Monday.  I plan to be there.  Please say a prayer for "The Little School With the Big Heart!"    Well, change is good, and maybe it is time to move on.  We will survive.    That's it for now!

      What a perfect day!  I just love it when we can open the windows and turn the noisy AC off!  Dave and I are going to walk in the Carrollton Charity Road Race on Saturday.  We are just doing the 5K, which comes out to be about 3 miles.  We are in training this week, so we are very happy that the weather is nice.  We are not planning to set any records, but it is an event sponsored by the Lions Club, so we decided to support it.  I'm glad to be walking evenings with my hubby!    Nothing real exciting is going on here, but I just want to keep my blog fresh!  See U soon!

      Hi All! We are back from our canoe trip!  What a great weekend.  The weather was perfect for floating down the river.  It only took us 10 hours to make the 4 hour float!  HAHAHAHA!!  And  that's  a true story!  We make many stops for socializing and swimming.  We camped up there for the entire weekend.  Saturday night was a little warm for sleeping, but it worked out ok, because we got up early on Sunday.  We did get some rain Sun. morning.    Well, today I went to Midland to get some much needed glasses.  I crossed the line to bi-focals!  That is going to take some getting used to, I'll tell you that!  They work pretty well for reading, I just have to adjust to working around the house without tripping over my feet!  I also got a pair of prescription sunglasses.  The photo-grays do not work very well for driving, and since the store was selling buy one, get one free, I got free sunglasses.  They had to order the lenses, so I won't be able to get those until later in the week.  That's it for today!

      Hey Blog Readers! We're going on a short vacation tomorrow morning.  A rustic camping trip which will include a canoe trip down the Manistee River.  It promises to be good weather and a good time.  We go with about 10-15 other couples. Great fun!    Just got back from the dentist and now I have to pack the camper.  Here's hoping everyone has a great weekend.   urlLink Windy's Page for Thought

      Greetings to all! Nat, I just read your blog.  I was wondering the same thing, (about how the featured blogs are picked.)  I also noticed that the latest updated blogs never include mine, or anyone I know.  I even check right after I blog.  Has anybody ever read one of the featured blogs?  Some are pretty weird, some interesting, and some are just plain boring!  Well, that's my opinion anyway.  I finished the curtains for the camper.  Actually I finished the curtains a while ago, but I had to make the valances.  I almost forgot that I wanted to have them done by this weekend.  Now they're done, and they look quite nice.  We are going on another canoe trip this weekend.  The weather should prove to be better than the last trip we had!  Not much rain in the forcast.  We could use the rain, I know, and I hope we get some, really!  Just not over the weekend!    Have a good day!

      HI!  Well, it's Saturday again!  Dave was up early to finish off the rest of the chickens.  He has them all plucked, but he is now gutting them.  As you can see, I'm not out there!  Nick is over to work on his car so he helped his dad pluck.  Dave should be finished about 10:00.    I'm just about finished with the sampler I'm making for JacLynn.  I just have to do the backstitching.  That always goes pretty fast for me, so I should finish the whole thing by the end of the week.  It's cute.

      What a wonderful day!  The sun is shining and the humidity is low.  Perfect conditions!    I found a recipe for rhubarb bread.  It is delicious!  I am making that this year instead of the zucchini bread I've made in the past.  Since we don't have a garden, but we do have plenty of rhubarb it works out great.  I made some over the weekend, but I've since modified the recipe to be low fat.  I'll post the original recipe and my modifications on Nowak Notables for any of you who are interested it.  I'll also post it on our families public site.  I believe it is Barton's Place.    I forgot to mention what has been going on across the road from us.  They are clearing out the woods.  I think it might not be a good thing.  They are really taking the logs out, and we're not sure if a house is going up or what.  Oh well, the way we hear it is the owner is selling the timber for quite a profit.  They've been working there since school has been out.    That's it for today!

      Well here it is Wednesday already!  Of course I'm still up from Tuesday!  That's unusual for me.  Dave and I went to the Lion's meeting tonight.  Everyone there agreed that the Relay for Life would be better attempted next year.    Dave and Matt did not butcher all the chickens on Sunday, only 20 of them.  He will butcher the rest on Saturday.  We bagged and vacuum sealed them yesterday.  They are big!  Not like the scrawny things we had last year.  Anyway, they will be delicious.  Mom, if you play your cards right, (And you always do!)  You'll have a chicken in your freezer soon.  Dad doesn't know what he's missing!  Well, I don't have much else to say, so see ya!

      Hi All! Dave got up early today to butcher chickens!  By early I mean we set the alarm for 5:00!  I helped him get his water and a coffee and I went back to bed.  His buddy Matt came over to help and that was good because they finished at about 10:00.  Matt's kid also came.  I'm glad because as all of you know, I DON'T DO GUTS!  I did fix breakfast for all though.  Just takin' it easy for the reas of the day.

      Another great day!  We did go to the fireworks on the 4th.  We went up to Beaverton at about 9:30.  We had no problem finding a parking spot and we just walked to the park.  We ended up right across the spot where the fire works were being shot off.  Quite a nice show, but a little short.  We ran into Nick while we were waiting for the traffic to clear, so we passed the time quite pleasantly.  We only had to wait about 20 mins before we were on our way back home.  Friday Dave finished his brake job.  I'm glad he got it done, because he said he's had a few scary stops in the past week or so.  He also fixed the 4-wheel drive on his truck.  That hasn't worked right since November.  That's mainly what took so long to do the job, because he could have gotten it finished in a day if that didn't need to be repaired.    I did get a chance to do some stitching on Thursday and Friday.  I find it most relaxing, and I'll probably do some more tonight.  I'd really like to finish that sampler.  Today we had a party to go to.  It was an anniversary party for some friends.  We had a nice time, but it was in Reese, so it was a bit of a drive.  We are just chilling out tonight!  I like it when I don't have to cook dinner!    Talk later!

       urlLink Windy's Page for Thought  HAPPY 4TH OF JULY!  I hope everyone has a great day.  As for us Nowak's, we are hanging around the house doing what we want or need to do.  Dave has been planning on doing a complete overhaul on the brakes on the Ford truck.  He figured since it is a 4 day weekend this would be a good time to do it.  He has been out in the garage since 7:00 am!  He did have a short bread for breakfast around 10:00.  I defrosted one of our outdoor freezers, cooked and cleaned up breakfast, and finally found some time to go on line.  I'm also helping Dave when he needs it.  It seems to be going pretty well for him, I'm glad of that!  Yesterday I spent about 3 hours on line collecting clip art, uploading pics and updating one of my web sites.  I was going to blog, but just rand out of time.  Oh well, it was a good day, and I'm glad to have my page updated.  Next week I'm going to work on my school site.  It will have a complete overhaul as I will no longer be in charge of the 4th grade.  I also got my hair cut and permed yesterday.  It looks pretty good if I do say so myself!  That was a 3 hour stint in the beauty salon.  Now I remember why I don't do this as often as they recommend.    I think I will spend a large portion of this day sitting in air conditioned comfort and cross stitching.  That is something I have not done in a long time, and I'd really like to finish my sampler for JacLynn.    Update on the Lion's board meeting.  I went to the board meeting Tuesday night.  There were only 4 other people there, including Dave.  I discussed the issues of the Relay for Life, and the members that were there agreed that it was too short notice to get things ready.  Also, Natalie and I did not really realize what we were getting ourselves into when we decided to be in charge of the Relay for Life.  We are not going to participate this year, but will start fund raising and organizing next year in January.  I will actually bring it up at the November meeting so we will be well prepared.    Well, I hope everyone has a great 4th!  I know I will.  We may go see fireworks tonight at Beaverton. Bye!

       urlLink My Lycos  Hi! I'm trying this through the "BLOGGER POST"  Not sure if it will work or if I'm typing in the right spot.  Well, I finished mowing the lawn  today.  It was a hot one, that's for sure!  I didn't bag it, so it went pretty quickly.    Nat and I joined the Carrollton Lions Club in March.  We are trying to be active members and participate in the activities sponsored by the club.  In June one of the members invited a speaker from the American Cancer Society Relay For Life to speak.  No one seemed to want to take control of the activity, so Nat and I did.  We sent out letters to all the members, but we are not getting any response.  I am hoping it is because it is such short notice.  I'm going to the board meeting tonight and if there is not enough support we are pulling from the relay.  We need to send names of team members out to the Cancer Society by Friday and so far no one has responded.  I told Nat that if there is no support we will pull from the relay, but try again next year.  Hopefully if we start fund raising in January we will be successful.  Well, wish us luck!

      Ok, I have 4 days in at work!  It is much harder than I originally thought.  The kids are just kids, but at a lower level than I'm used to working with.  They also have very different needs.  Most of the children have a hard time sitting still longer than 20 minutes.  They love to be read to, as long as they like the story.  They really like the story I'm reading, "Bud, Not Buddy!"  by Christopher Paul Curtis.  He is an author from Flint, Michigan.  The book is about a boy who is an orphan during the days of the depression.  It is a good story.  Anyway,  I still don't know if I have the job, and won't know until Sept 9.  If I get the job, I'll have my work cut out for me, but the pay will make it worth while!    O&O!

      Today I worked in a public school for the first time.  I would just like to say, kids are kids!  And they were great today.  The children were really polite and very well behaved.  I'm sure if I would have allowed it, they could have been all over me, but I was firm and they were great.  I was supposed to teach language arts to 3 sections of students all day, but today at lunch we were told that tomorrow we would have our 1st class for the whole day.  They are going back to self contained without even giving this new program a chance.  It seems some of the older teachers were upset about the schedule change, and complained to the right people, the board!  Well the board of ed for BV told Mr. Mosley that he had to drop the new schedule for the time being.  It's ok, I don't mind being self-contained.  I'm really hoping the teacher I'm subbing for doesn't come back.    Our weekend was great also.  Melissa and Jeremy were up for a short time with JacLynn.  We had a nice time at dinner on Friday and Saturday was really great.  We were at the wedding and got to watch JacLynn while Melissa and Jeremy visited with their friends.  We were glad to do it, and they were glad to have us.  They returned safely home by Sunday evening.  That's it for now! O&O!

      Yet another update! I have a place to go to work on Monday.  I'll be subbing at Buena Vista until September 9th.  Mr. Mosley (he's the principal) told me he wanted me in that classroom.  He wants an experienced teacher in that room.  I was all over Saginaw today getting my paper work straightened out.  Donna says the pay is really quite good, and Nat tells me that BV has the highest pay scale for teachers in Saginaw County.  I do have the possibility of being called in for the job I interviewed for yesterday, and if that happens I'll check it out.  But I think if the pay is good enough in BV and they want me, I may stay.  From what Donna says, it could be more than twice as much as the office job has to offer.    On another note,  Melissa and Jeremy are coming to town today for a wedding on Saturday.  We're having dinner with them at The BT tonight.    Well, that's all for now! O&O!

      Update on the job situation: I haven't heard back from the Francis Reh Acedemy.  Since school started 2 days ago, I don't think that is a good sign.  I have heard from the accounting office.  I have an interview tomorrow.  I also heard that there is a job opening in the Buena Vista school district.  I called the guy in charge, and he heard from 3 different people on his staff that I would be great in the position, (it's 4th grade).  He said they have to post the opening, but he would call me tomorrow.  As I will not be home all day, I'll try to contact him sometime tomorrow.  Maybe I can get an interview there.  My friend Donna works there, and also a parent of a former student of mine.  Both of them sang my praises, and the other person recommending me is someone I met briefly at Donna's Dad's funeral.  Once again, say a prayer!  I'm hopeful something will work out.  Yesterday when I got home from Saginaw, I mowed lawn.  It is looking greener now that we have had a little rain.  It went pretty quickly, as I did not bag the clippings.  I canned some pickles after that, and finished up the pickles today.  We have 40 quarts now, which is certainly more than we need, but Dave helped me pick when I went, and he hated to see a good cuke go to waste!  We also have lots to eat fresh, but they are only good for so long.  Anyway, if anyone would like some pickles, let me know!  Also if you have some of my jars, just save them and give them to me when you see me next.  Mom and Nat are pretty good about doing that, but I see them most so thats probably why.  Well, that's it for now, Thanks for reading! O&O blog buddies!

      We had a wonderful weekend camping!  The weather was great!  We went tubing down the Rifle River, played horse shoes, and chatted around the campfire!  It was difficult to pack up and come home on Sunday.    This coming weekend we have a wedding to attend.  We will also get to babysit JacLynn later in the evening.  The wedding is one of Melissa's friends and we are invited.  We will stay for dinner and some of the after dinner festivities, but we are happy to be able to take JacLynn off Melissa's hands for a while while they stay for the dancing and such.  The following weekend is Labor Day and we are planning to visit Mom and Dad in Scottville.  Of course we are looking forward to that trip.    I haven't heard from the folks in the accounting office, but I did hear about a job in Saginaw, at the Francis Reh Acedemy.  It is now a charter school.  I dropped off a resume this morning and I have an interview tomorrow at 10:30 am.  I'm praying I get the job!    O&O!

      All in all, today was a pretty good day.  I got my pickles canned and my hair colored.  While in Midland I applied for a job in an accounting office and updated my file at the Midland Public Schools. We are getting ready to chat, so I'm off to the chat room.  I'm glad I read bubba's blog, because mom thought it was weird that no one showed up for the scheduled chat!  She missed the pm part, an easy mistake!  I'm glad I caught up with her before the time! O&O!

      Ok! Moving on! I have resumes out to various school districts.  Thanks again to Mom, who helped me put the finishing touches on it.  I'm also going to try to get some tutoring jobs.  (If any of my readers know of a student who needs help, contact me at:  linowak98@yahoo.com ) I will try to post a contact me link on my side bar.  Besides what I'm doing on the job hunt front, I'm going to try to be more productive at home.  The house should be cleaner and more organized, and I should realistically have more time to commit to working out.  I was given some cukes over the weekend, and since my pickle supply is down, (last canned in '97!)  I'm going to get those canned tomorrow morning!  Certainly time to move on!  O&O!

      Hi!   I guess I hadn't realized I've been away from my blog for that long.  Well, I'm updating now.    I've had school and church on my mind a lot lately.  It's difficult for me to believe that a "man of the cloth" could lie to us they way he did.  I know that the entire result is not Fr. Ron's total fault, but I feel he knew about it before we were informed.  I also feel he knew about it as he was promising us employment.  If he didn't know for sure, I'm sure he knew it was a possibility.  I don't know how he could have said, "There is NO way, absolutely no way a school can be closed down that quickly!"  Well, we found out, there was a way.  I was raised to respect the priest and any other members in authority.  I had a very negative experience with a Nun years ago with my first job.  I thought she was just a bad apple.  Now this.  And, as much as I respected Fr. Richard, I feel he is also partly responsible for the mess the school was in.  He should never have left the parish without firing Johnna.  He should have at least talked to her about her people skills.  Well, that's enough of that!  Thanks for letting me vent!  Of course this IS my blog, so I'm sure I can vent whenever I want to!  O&O!

Not the happiest day of my life, but we are thankful for the $ we have coming to us.  I'm very thankful for Mom and her help and ideas regarding my resume.   Hopefully something will turn up for me soon.  I am actively looking for employment.   Over and Out blog buddies!

      This is the article as it appeared inthe Saginaw News tonight.  St. Josaphat to close   Tuesday, August 6, 2002  MIKE ROCHA THE SAGINAW NEWS     Teacher Mary Kay Letherer-Harten cried while hugging her now former students and their parents Monday outside St. Josaphat Church in Carrollton Township after an hour-long parent meeting.    After weeks of speculation, it was final: St. Josaphat School -- one of Saginaw County's oldest -- will close.   Parish council members and the Rev. Ronald Dombrowski made the official announcement at the private gathering, noting that a last-ditch fund-raising effort to keep the school open fell short.   "It's so hard," said Harten, 42, a St. Josaphat middle school teacher the past four years.   Harten earlier this year turned down a teaching job at St. Thomas Aquinas because she was assured the 89-year-old Josaphat school would remain open.   "As a teacher, these students become your children," she said. "You develop a relationship with them and give them ownership of the classroom. We have had no closure on this.   "We didn't get a chance to say good-bye."   There just weren't enough funds and students to keep the parochial school going, Dombrowski said.   "Parish finances and the high cost of education were the ultimate reasons," said Dombrowski, who is in his second year at St. Josaphat.   "This is the saddest day in the life of the parish. We felt we just couldn't do it anymore. Once enrollment started dropping, our base was gone. This is a deep loss."   Marilyn Klenk, president of the school's PTA for eight years, said that last week's meeting was the death knell for the school.   "We knew it was coming," said Klenk, who with her husband, Kevin, have twin daughters transferring to Carrollton Elementary School.   School bleeding   Word leaked out two weeks ago that officials wanted to shutter the school, which took most families and parishioners by surprise.   A meeting last week confirmed those fears, but left room for a reprieve if enrollment improved and the parish could raise $170,000 in a week. Parishioners contributed about $98,000, but in the end it wasn't enough.   The church could have come up with the necessary funds if given more time, said fourth-grade teacher Linda Nowak.   "We were told a week ago and look, we raised $98,000," said Nowak, who taught at St. Josaphat for 21 years.   "They're trying to blame the parishioners for the school closing. They never told us how bad the situation was. The parents would have banded together. Give us a chance!"   With school starting in less than a month, parents were not waiting and began pulling their children out of St. Josaphat and signing them up at other schools.   Enrollment, as expected, dropped to 34 from 88 in a week.   "With the publicity, people started taking their kids out," said Dombrowski, adding that it was a "possibility" the school would have remained open if the parish had raised the $170,000 and enrollment remained at 88.   Silence hurts   One of the sharpest criticisms of church officials was that they did not tell parishioners and parents the school was in danger of closing until last week.   Officials said little because they hoped enrollment would turn around, said Dombrowski, who along with others contend they informed the community of the school's financial troubles last spring when they asked parishioners to increase their contributions by 10 percent.   The increases did not occur, he said.   However, residents and teachers maintain that school leaders never told parishioners and families the school would fold if they did not see the financial increases.   They also said the community would have reacted more favorably with contributions if they would have known the school could founder.   Even teachers, who raised concerns during the school year and as late as July, were told by Dombrowski the school would not close, Nowak said.   "We stayed out of loyalty," Harten said.   Nowak commuted everyday from Beaverton.   "I moved up north and continued to work here. That says a lot about our program," said Nowak, who like Harten is now looking for a new job.   Last week, Harten and her daughter, Jillian McManaman, 10, spent a day clearing out Harten's classroom.   "(Jillian) is very sad," Harten said. "She was teary-eyed and then she told me, 'Mama ... this isn't our school anymore."   What's next?   Like a host of other students, Jillian McManaman, a fifth-grader, will attend St. Helen School in Saginaw. Large numbers also will enroll at Carrollton Public Schools.   Still others may attend St. Thomas Aquinas and SS. Peter and Paul in Saginaw Township and St. Stephen in Saginaw.   Both Harten and Nowak praised St. Helen and Carrollton school officials for their efforts to welcome St. Josaphat students.   "They have been wonderful," Harten said.   St. Josaphat teachers, many of whom average about half the salary of their public school colleagues -- had indicated they would've taken pay cuts to keep St. Josaphat open.   Nevertheless, fifth-grade teacher Debbie Stanolis, 43, who now is unemployed, said she feels sorry for the students.   "My disappointment is for the children," she said. "They're losing friends, mentors and role models."   Parents will receive their registration fees back, said Dombrowski, who also pledged St. Josaphat Church will financially assist those families who continue to send their children to a Catholic school.   "We'll continue with fair share ... we'll help out as much as possible," he said.   Officials will release student records to respective schools as soon as St. Josaphat receives the request, Dombrowski said.   Church officials are not sure what they will do with the school building, which they will continue to use for faith formation or catechism classes, Dombrowski said.   Before leaving Monday, school staffers and volunteers took time to show the community their appreciation by changing the school's marquee to read:   "Eighty-nine years of love and support ... we thank you." t   Mike Rocha covers education for The Saginaw News.

      I'm sure most of you have heard by now, but St. Josaphat School is no longer!  It was quite an emotional meeting for us last night.  Lots of kids and parents were crying and coming up to us teachers and thanking us for all we had done.  One parent actually said, "Thanks for helping my 2 boys become the men they are today!"  I was truly touched.  Today was not easy either, I'll tell you that.  But I do believe that when God closes one door, he will open another.  (I am a little hard pressed to see God in this whole mess, however!) I went to unemployment, but the office is only open on Monday and Wednesdays.  I will file tomorrow morning.  We have to post our resumes on line, too.    In talking to some of the other teachers today, we decided to stay in contact with each other.  We are going to try to get together once a month, or at least every other month.  I am hosting the first get together next Thursday, and yes, Nat you are welcome to come.  In fact I really hope you will be here.  We decided husbands will be optional in the gathering!    Well, wish me luck in the job department!  Over and Out to all my good blog buddies!

      Well tomorrow is the big day.  Nat and I will find out if we have jobs or not.    Today was just an easy laid back sort of day.  We didn't do too much around here.  I did some stitching and cooking.  Nick was over again this weekend working on his car.    That's it for now!

      Hi!   It's been a busy couple of days!  Yesterday I kid-sat for Patti.  David and I had a great day, and the dogs were even well behaved.  I think Richard was a little afraid to go to work after he let the dogs in because Scrappy kept barking at me.  She settled down though and most of the day the dogs just laid around.  David was a great help when it came time to put the dogs in their outdoor cage for a bathroom break.  We took a little field trip to my favorite cross stitch store, The Stitching Well.  I didn't stay long because, well, because I was short of funds, but I bought a nice piece of fabric for my next project.  We also watched Harry Potter and David played a video game.  After lunch he did his homework and then we had a grand swim in the pool!  I even got to hear David play his piano piece that he performed at his recital.  All in all, Pat, I'd do it again!  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, Patti's bird Chika is talking!  I heard him talk to Scrappy, and whistle!  I was impressed!  Today we got out on the water at about 4:30.  We stayed later than we ever did, but it was great to get out there and cool off.  We played in the water and had a ride around Wixom Lake.  We got home at about 10:45, but that was partly because we had to wait for some morons to get out of our way!  Then when they got their boat out of the water they parked right in fromt of the launch pad.  We could not get the truck down there until they realized they were in the wrong place to tie down their boat.  We also played "Good Samaritan" while on the water.  There were some people who were only out for their second time and they ran out of gas.  We towed them in.  There were parked in the same launching area we were so it was no problem.    Well, I'll most likely blog either tomorrow or Monday.  One more thing, the flat tire queen stirkes again!  This morning Dave went out to the yard and discovered the new truck had a flat tire!  What a bummer!  It had air in it on Friday evening when I got home, but it was flat this morning.  There was no nail or glass, it just seems to be a slow leak.  It held air today, but did go down by evening.  Tomorrow Dave will take it to Edenville to get fixed.    Bye!

      Well I got the grass cut yesterday, or should I say weeds!  WOW!  With the dry July we had, the only things that flourished in our yard were the weeds and the poppies!  Thankfully the poppies looked good for a long while!  I do believe they are now past their prime.  Dave spent two evenings working on the Ford truck brakes.  That left me without transportation for 2 days!  Not that I would have gone anywhere, except to Meijer's, but it's just the idea.  Anyway, today I finally made it to Meijer's, and wouldn't you know, I ran into 2 people I know!  I can usually go there and never see anyone. Oh well, I was home by noon anyway!    That's it for now!

Check out the bazaar at St. Simon and Jude on Saturday, October 12th!  You will be able to really get a jump on your Christmas shopping!  I hope to see lots of people there!  That's all for tonight!

      Hi!   We had a great weekend.  Dave and his brother Wally tried some fishing.  Dave caught a small mouth bass, but it was a half inch too short!  I was on the boat when he caught it and we had our moment of excitement.  He caught some other fish that were also too small to keep.  It's ok, he had a good time trying.  He always says, "A bad day fishing is better than a good day at work!"  We had a campfire going all weekend and did our cooking over the fire.  That cuts down on dishes!  And speaking of dishes, our niece, Rachel, helped me do mine!  What a treat!  Dave and I also got in a good long walk.  It felt good!  Our goal is to walk 4 times a week, and we only got in 3 days this week.  We are determined to do it this week though!    I just wanted to let my blog fans know that I am working on the music situation on my page.  I feel I made some progress today because when I was at Fortune City trying to load a web-gem I was told there was an error of some sort.  I will have to speak to my blog goddess to find out if we can work out this situation.  I also found a midi file of the song "Windy"  That is the tune I'm working on getting here!  Anyway, I'm hoping to have the problem resolved by the end of the week!  O&O Blog Buddies!

      Well, I'm getting some organizational things accomplished in the house.  This is a good thing.  I'm currently working in the computer room.  My goal is to have it somewhat organized by the end of next week.  I believe this a doable goal.  Is doable a word?  It sounds right, but just doesn't look right in print.  Maybe one of my faithful readers will comment on this for me!  Anyway, it's too bad the house gets messy just being a house!   On another note, Dave and I started walking nightly.  We missed tonight because some people stopped by, and it was too late to go after they left, but we are trying to do this at least 4 times a week.  We already went on Monday and Tuesday, so I'm sure we will be successful this week!  Dave wants to get in shape for the hunting season, and I, well, I just want to get in shape!  As Martha Stuart would say, "It's a good thing!"  O&O good blog buddies!

      We're back from a great weekend.  It was good to get away.  We went out on the boat yesterday am, Dave to fish, and me to just enjoy the ride.  I always have a good book in hand too!  Later in the afternoon we went out again.  When Dave finished fishing he gave me a lesson on driving the boat.  It isn't too bad, but I have to get used to where to position the motor when we are going at different speeds.  Today, even though it was raining, was very relaxing.  Yesterday and today we went on several walks.  All in all, it was a great weekend.  O&O

      I canned 19 jars of stewed tomatoes yesterday.  That was just about an all day job!  After blanching, peeling, and chopping all the tomatoes, you have to do the onions and peppers!  I left the garlic out because I was tired to chopping!  I'll add garlic to my cooking.  Then I read the ball book on canning tomatoes only to find out you have to water bath them for 40 minutes.  Doing 6 quarts at a time, this took up most of the afternoon.  I was almost finished when one of my jars had a blow out in the canning kettle.  As a result, I have 2 jars I didn't boil.  They are in the fridge and will be used in a recipe soon!  Anyway, I feel this was quite an accomplishment.  For all the tomatoes I chopped I thought I would have gotten more jars, but it all boiled down to 19 quarts, well 20 if you count the one that blew up!    Today I baked a half a turkey.  This was dinner tonight and will be our meals over the weekend.  The only cooking will be done over the campfire in the form of Turkey Pot Hobo Pies.  Easy and delicious!  Of course I'll most likely cook breakfast on Saturday am.  There's something about a turkey cooking in the oven.  I LOVE the smell!  I think it brings back happy memories of holidays past when mom was up early to get the turkey in the oven for a 3:00 dinner.  Anyway, the house still smells great!  It was a bit hot today to be running the oven, but in the end, it was worth it.    That's all for now.  I'm not sure if I'll have time to blog tomorrow, so here's hoping everyone has a great weekend!

      Good evening blog buddies!  This past weekend was pretty uneventful.  Laundry, general straightening of the house, and cooking.  Dave and I did happen to discuss the possibility of buying some tomatoes at the farmer's market, and low and behold, we were offered all the tomatoes we wanted to pick!  I went today and picked.  I froze a bunch, but ran out of freezer space!  Tomorrow I'll can a bunch of stewed tomatoes.  I will say this, if I were working I wouldn't have time to do this!  Anyway, that's about all that's new around here.  We have a nice quiet camping trip planned for this weekend.  We are going to Mitchell St. Park.  It will just be the 2 of us, our camper and our boat!  We should have a good time!  Dave might take off at noon so we won't have to set up camp in the dark!  Anyway it should be fun!

      For a Friday the 13th, the day has not been bad!  I made a bunch of zuchinni bread and the house is still clean from Tuesday.  I will admit, it took me 2 days to clean when Nat and I can finish in about 4 hours together!  I tried to defrag my computer this morning, but I got a message saying I need to run a scandisc first.  That took almost all day to do, and I had all the extra programs turned off.  I'll probably defrag later this weekend.    Yesterday six of us from SJS went to see a lawyer about the way SJS handled the closing of the school.  He seems pretty sure that we have a good case.  Not only did most of us have signed contracts, but we all were working under verbal agreements.  I'll keep you posted on how that goes.  O&O!

I am going up to the ISD in Harrison tomorrow to sign up for subbing in the Gladwin/Beaverton area.  I also told the Saginaw ISD that I'd be available to sub in Freeland or Carrollton.

(sjs)  I think I got almost all of my stuff now.  I just have to get my stereo.  I don't think anybody will steal it because it is soooo old it still has an 8 track player!  I will pick it up though because it has sentimental value to me.  I'm hoping I get the job an BV because then I will have a place to store it!  Well that's not the only reason I'm hoping for the job.  We sure could use the $!  Also, I'll be able to relax a bit after I know that the job is mine.    That's all for now!

      Hi!   We are back from a great weekend at the folks!  We had a nice time visiting with Mom, Dad, and Sharlene and her crew.  We enjoyed some boat rides on Hackert Lake and also the Pontoon ride with Shar, Kev, and Lisa on Hamlin Lake.  It was a good trip, but the ride home could have been less stressful.  Hopefully we'll find a better way back from the West side of the state.  O&O!

      Good Morning & HAPPY HALLOWEEN!  Yesterday I spent most of the afternoon bagging up the leaves.  The yard looks really nice now, even with the frost on the grass!    On another note, Nick picked up his car this week.  He had it painted bright orange!  It looks nice, even though it is not the color I'd have picked.  He's pretty happy with it though, and that's what counts.    O&O!! for now.

We will not be eating brats for days!  Sunday was just a laundry day, and a day to get caught up on a few things around the house.  And for those of you wondering, Dave did get the turkeys butchered.  They are now resting peacefully in the freezer!  WOW!   Today I visited Mom and Dad and worked on my website.  I'll post the link on the side tomorrow.  I'm happy with the way it is turning out.  Thanks, Mom, for all your help!  I also had a nice visit with Grandma.  She gave me some jars which I'll be needing!  So, I feel today was a very successful day!  O&O Blog Buddies!!!

      Good evening Blogger Buddies! Tomorrow will be a busy day.  Nat and I have a table at the bazaar at St. John's.  We should do well.  When I get home company will be here.  As some of you may already know, Nick is leaving at the end of this month for Arizona.  Dave wanted to have a small get-together to wish him well.  He's running it, and even made most of the phone calls, as he knew I had planned to be gone for the day.  The only thing I had to do was buy the brats na dogs!  He will have them cooking when I get home and hopefully some folks will show up.  Most of Dave's brothers and sisters told him they would let him know, and only one has confirmed!  All I can say we will have brats galore if people don't come!  Dave is also going to butcher the turkeys in the morning so he has a busy day planned also!  I visited mom and dad this morning and mom taught me some interesting and fun tips about making borders and banners.  I spent much of this evening collecting some border clip art so I'll have some stuff to play with on my hard-drive.  I think Sunday I'll be able to put the lessons to practice.  Well, if you are in the area, and not doing anything, be sure to stop by St. John's tomorrow!  In addition to the crafts for sale, they have a great Mexican lucheon.  Hope to see you there!

      Hi Blog Buddies! I don't really have much to talk about today.  I went to a baby shower for a friend tonight.  I stopped and visited my sis in Saginaw.  That is one thing I really miss about SJS closing, because I used to see Nat on a daily basis, but now it is only a couple times a month.  Ya don't know whatcha got 'till it ain't there!  I was good to see some of my work friends.  There is not much going on around here.  Dave cleaned out the chimney in the garage tonight.  I guess he got pretty dusty, but it is a job that needs to be done yearly and he is very good about that sort of thing.    Well, that is it for now! O&O good blog buddies!

      Well, we had a great weekend camping, in spite of our rough start.  Within minutes of setting up camp and moving the truck, we discovered that we had a flat tire on the truck!  To top it off it had started raining almost as soon as we arrived, so Dave changed the tire in the rain.  We were lucky to find a place to have it repaired though!  The other bad thing we had happen is we were still having problems with our heater!  We were going to go home Saturday, but Wally had an electric heater and a generator with him, and he let us use it.  I'm glad because we did lots of bike riding yesterday and today.  It was a "fitness" weekend!  It really did end out being a great time, and we really enjoyed the bike rides, even though my butt got really sore because I hadn't prepared myself ahead of time.  The trails are beautiful!  We were at Rifle River Recreation Area.  We must have logged about 5 hours of riding over the two days, and considering we hadn't done much riding at all over the summer, it was quite an accomplishment!  O&O!!!

      I baked cookies today!  Buena Vista is talking about laying off 12 teachers.  It looks like I'm not getting a job there!  We decided it would be better to not sub and just collect my unemployment for the time being.  I was making the same amount of $ subbing as I am not working, and by not working, at least I'm not putting wear and tear on the truck.  I called the unemployment office to find out what the ruling would be on that and the woman I talked to said I am no obligated to accept any work that is less than 75% of what I made last year.  Well subbing doesn't cut it!  I'm sure I'll find work by Jan, Feb at the latest.  It might not be teaching, but it will surely be closer to home!    My house is clean today, except for the computer room, and Nick's room.  I only wish I was a great organizer!  Oh well, I can't be good at  everything !  WOW!!!

      Hi All! One bazaar done, one more to go!  I'm hoping to sell lots of stuff at St. John's!  I had a good time at the bazaar last Saturday.  Nat did a wonderful job setting up and running the whole thing!  WAY TO GO, NATWI!!!!!  The only thing missing were the customers.  I think the weather was way too nice for people to venture out.  With the added threat of really cold weather on Sunday folks just decided to stay home and, no doubt, work in their yards!  Anyway, it was a nonstressful day, and I am sure I will sell most of my goodies at St. John's.    Good news for Thanksgiving.  Our wittle sis is coming for a short visit.  She may even be bringing a friend.  It will be a great time at mom and dad's place, too bad Dave is going to be at deer camp!  Oh well, maybe he'll get a deer this year!  wow!!!  I'll be joining the group on Friday.  Most of the wives come up then and we cook up a thanksgiving dinner for the "great hunters!"    That's it for today! O&O!!!

      Hi! Hey I just read Nat's blog, and I'd also like to plug the bazaar!  You will not only enjoy great food and possibly win wonderful prizes, but you can purchase many items for Christmas!  I will be there selling cookies, cappuccino, and soups in a jar.  Nat is selling many new items also.  Please check us out!  I'm sure it will be a great time for all.  A note to Mom:  I found out that the 1st grader who threatened a teacher was at Longfellow School.  That is in the city, not BV.    O&O Blog Buddies!

      Hi All! I'm on Mom's computer right now.  I subbed again in Buena Vista.  The kids are pretty good.  It is the same class I had last week.  Their teacher leaves pretty good lesson plans too.  Well, I figured since I was in town I might as well go to women's group tonight, but that still leaves me with a couple hours to kill so here I am!  As it turns out, Mom and Dad are leaving at about 6:30 also.    This weather is great!  I love the cool temps and the sunshine.  The leaves are all turning colors.  What a beautiful world we live in.  That's it for now!  O&O

      Hi!  I blogged last night, but my computer kicked me off line!  Oh well, not all of technology is perfect!  WOW!!!    Anyway, between yesterday and today I made lots and lots of stuff to sell at the bazaar.  I'm doing 2 bazaars with Nat and then Rika has a fund raiser that I'm going to try to sell my stuff at.  Hopefully I can sell everything!  So far I have 30 small jars of soup mix and 15 large jars, I also have 15 jars of sand art cookies and 15 jars of oatmeal chocolate chip.  I still have to make some cappuccino mix and I might try a few new things if I have time.    Alex, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!   After reading 3 more days...., and 2 more days... on your blog I figured it out!  I hope you liked your card, and I hope you have a great day!  Well, I have quite the mess to clean up in the kitchen, so that's it for now!  O&O!!!

      I love this weather!  The past 2 days have been a little warm, but I'm loving the 50-60ish days!  Also, I noticed today on my way to Saginaw, the colors of the leaves are changing!  It can even make US10 look nice!

      Hi! I subbed yesterday and today.  Both were pretty good days.  I got a bunch of jars from one of my "stuffs in a jar" fans, so tomorrow if I don't have to work, I'll be making my stuff for the bazaar on Saturday.  I may try something new for you kitty lovers!  I'm not sure if I'll have time though.  I don't really have much to say tonight, but I wanted to post a quick note.   O&O!

      Hi blog fans! I'm looking forward to a nice weekend!  It will start early, on Thurs, with a good family visit.  We will all be together for this great holiday meal.  How nice it is to visit on line with family, but even nicer to visit in person.    Well, I might blog later if I think of some more stuff to write about! O&O!!!

      Hi All! The Internet is a wonderful thing!  I'm so glad to be able to chat with family and friends when I get on line.  It is a great way to keep in touch!  If I don't run into someone, I'm usually able to keep informed by reading their blogs or visiting the family web sites.  I'm glad we have this  great way to communicate!  Dave did do a little hunting this morning.  When he got back I put on some orange and joined him for a walk of the property.  He showed me where he plans to hunt on Thursday.  I like these quiet walks with my husband!  He is a good man.    I can't believe that Thanksgiving is just around the corner.  Before you know it Christmas will be here!  I'm not ready for that!  Well, that's it for tonight! O&O!!!

      Howdy Blog Readers! It looks like Dave won't be hunting this weekend.  We may go up to deer camp tomorrow afternoon for a visit, but Dave is trying to get a side job finished.    I can't believe the snow we had up here yesterday!  It snowed just about all day, and it stuck to the ground.  The sun today melted some of it, but we still have snow on the ground here.  It is way too early for snow if you ask me, which obviously nobody did!  At least I didn't have to shovel.  It melted off the pavement almost as fast as it fell!  Anyway, that's about it for now! O&O!!!

      Well, it looks like blogger got it ironed out!    I must say, it is very quiet around here during the day.  I have the tv on just for background noise!  I decided to stop watching "er".  It is too depressing!  Plus they are into the re-runs of re-runs I already saw.  It doesn't take too long to catch all those re-runs when they run 2 shows a day!    Time to chat with Jan!

      Hey!  I'm not sure what's up with blogger, but I blogged last night, and it didn't post to my blogspot.  However, when I'm here, at the "edit your blog" place, it is there!  hmmmm.... I don't get it!  Well, maybe it will show up later.  Anyway, the weekend was good, and we did pretty well at the bazaar.  Dave got a deer on opening day and I got good news from the unemployment office.  I'll repost yesterday's blog if it doesn't appear later on.  O&O for now!

      Hi All! I had a pretty good weekend.  Nat and I did pretty good at the bazaar.  I spent a nice relaxing evening with Nat just stitchin' and bitchin'!  wow!  We really weren't bitchin' and I didn't even do that much stitchin', but we had a good visit, and chilled out watching a movie on the sap network!  When I got home today there was good news in the mailbox from the Unemployment office.  I decided to go up to deer camp and see how Dave did.  He got a deer opening day, but still decided to spend some time looking for the 30 point buck!  Oh well, we had a relaxing day even though no one at deer camp has seen a 30 point buck yet!  wow!    Well, that's my weekend in a nutshell, I'll blog more later in the week! O&O!!!

      Good Evening! I'm making stuff for my last bazaar.  I hope it is successful.  It should be, it is being held on the official "Deer Widow's Weekend!"  I think it is a good day for a bazaar!  Dave will be leaving for deer camp tomorrow night.  It would be nice if he got his deer this weekend, then he can just go up there to chill out!  I won't be going up this weekend, and probably only for a day visit next weekend, but Thanksgiving weekend I'll be there Fri-Sun.  We'll cook a turkey on Friday.    Oh, before I forget!  Thank You! Thank You! Thank You!  to Earthgoddess!!! She got the music on my site!  Now my blog is just as cool as my sisters' and mom's!  I just watched the bio on J. K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series.  She is a very interesting woman.  There was mention made of book banning and such.  Many so called Christian adults think the books will steer children into witch craft.  I remember when this issue was first brought up in the news, and one of my 4th grade students was reading the 1st book in the series.  He was very upset by the fact adults were saying children couldn't tell the difference between fact and fiction!  He said that maybe the parents were at fault if this were the case.  He ended up doing a very excellent book project on the book, and to my knowledge, he still has not converted to witchcraft!    I would agree that there are certain adult books children should not be exposed to.  They don't need to know intimate details described in many books, and they also do not need to be exposed to the language in many adult books.  But I think that if a children's book is controversial, the parent should read it with the child (if, of course, it is something the child wants to read).  Children are much more aware of what is going on in the world than many adults give them credit for.  Anyway, it's been my experience with the Harry Potter books that the only thing children have been inspired to do is read!  And there is certainly nothing wrong with that!  That's it for now! O&O!!!

      Hi! Yesterday we took the camper up to deer camp.  We left right after Nick came over to say good bye!  He is on his way to Arizona.    The deer camp is only about 1/2 hour away from home so we spent the afternoon and early evening there.  We had a small fire and just chilled out.  The only snacks we had were some Cheeze-its and pop, but it was just nice to get away for a while.  We were the only ones up there because all of the rest of the hunters brought their campers up on Saturday.  Dave is trying to keep the furnace working so yesterday morning he had to put a new part in.  Hopefully it won't give him any trouble when he is up there hunting.  He is bringing an electric heater just in case, and one of our friends has a generator so he'll be able to run it if he needs to.    I'm sitting here typing this and as I look out my window I see 3 blue jays playing in the lower branches of the pine tree.  Pretty neat to watch.  They've been there for a little while.  Well, that's it for now!  O&O

      Well!  Here I am again, not much to say either!  This weather has been great!  I'd like to see it stick around for a couple of weeks, but I'm pretty sure that's not going to happen.  Yesterday I did some yard work.  It's nice not to have to save all the yard work for the weekend!)  It's pretty quiet around here.  Dave is doing a side job in Saginaw.  He'll be gone all day.  He's soooo very tired when he gets home.   That's it for now! O&O

      Hello! Boy, I did a grubby job today.  I cleaned my oven!  Now that might not seem like a big task to those of you with those fancy dancy self cleaning ovens, but this one isn't, and it was a job I obviously put off too long.  And... since I had a clean oven, I had to have a clean kitchen, right?  Well, what I hoped would be finished in a couple of hours ended up taking all afternoon.  I'm really not a slob, but I decided to do a complete overhaul!  Feels good to get something like that accomplished!  I think tomorrow I'm going to set aside some time for cross-stitch.  I've read that Nat is doing that in the evenings, and I think that is great.  I have a project for granddaughter #2 all picked out, and even started, so I best get working on it.  Well, that's it for today! O&O!!!

      Today is Election Day!  I hope everyone got out and exercised their right to vote!  We did, in fact Dave came home mid-afternoon because he had just finished a job in the area.  We voted then, and there wasn't much of a line.  There was a pretty tall stack of papers, you know the ones you have to put your name on, and they check the book to see if you're registered?   We had snow here today, but nothing really stuck to the ground.  I'm glad, it seems too early for snow, but it snowed just about all afternoon, and changed to rain this evening.    Nick stopped by yesterday.  I guess the job that his boss had fell through so it looks like he'll be moving later this week or early next.  I hope he has a safe trip, that's a long drive to Arizona.  That's it for now! O&O!!

Nothing comes out on paper the same way it sounds in your head!  I wonder how many others have that problem?  Oh well, it is another quiet week here at my house.   O&O!!

       HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!   WOW!!!  Where does the time go?  It seems like only a few days ago we were just coming into 2002, and today is the last day!  WOW!  This year has certainly had its ups and downs, but as usual, we've picked ourselves up, and made the best of things.  I'm still getting used to being unemployed, but hopefully that will change soon.    We visited Nat and Alex yesterday evening for a fun time of games and laughter.  Alex had a friend over, and they played some games with us too.  Nat made some Chex-Mix and I made some of my chocolate covered peanuts.  We knew we'd have a few beers so we planned on staying over.  We slept on the floor, but we were comfortable.  We got up early and headed for Midland.  Did some grocery shopping, dropped off a Christmas gift to Dave's boss, had breakfast, and washed the truck.... all before 11:00 am!!!  Pretty productive if you ask me!    Today will be pretty quiet.  We were going to go to Walt and Sally's tomorrow, but Dave's uncle Frank died and so most of the family will be spending some time at the funeral home.  The funeral is Thursday in Hemlock.  As we missed Dave's folks this year on Christmas because of our trip we were planning on delivering gifts on New Year's Day, but we will most likely stop over there sometime later this afternoon.  I know we won't stay too late though, Dave is pretty tired!  Well, here's hoping everyone has a  SAFE AND HAPPY NEW YEAR!!  See ya in '03!! O&O!!!

Diet... here I come!  wow!!!  The kids are growing up fast too!  The girls are in their early teens and Geoff and James are Seniors in high school.  David is already in middle elementary school, 4th grade, I think!  Wow!!  Seems like yesterday they were babes!  Well, the holiday is over, but let's hope the Spirit will carry us through another year.  Peace on Earth to All!  O&O!!!

       MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE!!!  Hi all!  We are still at Melissa's house.  Everyone but me is napping!  We've been staying up late and talking and getting up early trying to be involved in each day to the fullest, and today I guess it just caught up with us.  I did have a short nap too, but I had to get up or I would feel too crappy later on.  We had a nice time here with Melissa, JacLynn, Jeremy, and Austin.  We had dinner with Jeremy's grandparents.  The kids got tons and tons of gifts, but not from us, and not from Melissa and Jeremy either!  The older folks around here really spoil those kids, but Jeremy said he is laying down the law next year!  I believe he'll do it too!  We ate way too much yesterday also!  Oh well, that doesn't happen too often!         Today we went to the Antientam Battle Field.  It is where 25,000 people lost their life fighting in one of the Civil War battles.  Very interesting!  This national park is pratically in Melissa's back yard!  There are lots of other places we could have visited too, but it would be better to do it in the summer.  We will be back.          Melissa and Jeremy are moving at the end of next month to the city of Hagerstown so Melissa's day care has a better chance of working out.  We saw their house, and they have lots of work to do before they can move in, but it is a bit bigger so the kids will each be able to have their own room.  Right now Austin really doesn't have a room when he stays here because JacLynn took it over.        Dave and I will be leaving early in the morning to head for home tomorrow.  We are hoping the weather is good.  We had a white Christmas here, but the roads are all cleared off now, but we heard they had lots more snow in Penn.  They should have the roads cleaned off pretty good by now though.  We are looking forward to seeing everyone on the 28th.    O&O!!!

      Howdy!  It is a gloomy day here in the big town of Beaverton!  Only a little sun first thing in the morning and since then, nothing but rain and drizzle!  It beats yesterday though!  ICE!!!  I'm glad I didn't have to go anywhere yesterday.  An update on our female cardinal:  She wasn't around for 2 or 3 days, but yesterday she was back.  I thought maybe the sun made the reflection on the window so clear she thought she would be outside, but she was here yesterday and today, so the sun doesn't play a factor as to when she comes.  I think she is just confused.  She does not hit the window very hard, but you can hear it in the next room.    Well, that's it for now!  Oh yeah, Thanks for the chat, Jan!

      Hey! I wanted to tell ya about a good book I read this weekend.  The title is "A Different Kind of Christmas" by Alex Haley.  It is about a young man from the south who attends college in the north.  When he meets some Quaker "friends" he becomes confused about his whole belief system regarding slavery.  I don't want to say any more because I'd hate to give it away, but I'll bring the book to Mom and Dad's on th 28th in case anyone wants to borrow it.  Just let me know!

      Well, it is one more week closer to Christmas!  Boy the time sure goes fast, even when you're not working!  wow!    We had a pretty good weekend.  I helped Dave with some projects in the garage on Saturday and then we played cards in the evening.  We ended up staying out quite late, but it was a fun time.  Sunday we just took it easy.  Today I spent some more time trying to track down a part for Dave's ford.  It's pretty hard to find parts for a truck that old, but I'm sure we'll find it.  The part he wants to repace isn't totally useless yet, but it is starting to go bad.    Well, that's it on the homefront.  Talk to you all soon! O&O!!!

      Hi again! I'm visiting the folks for lunch.  I invited myself over for the best salad in town!  :)    That cardinal is still trying to get into the house!  Oh well, she must not be hurting herself.  She is there everyday!  Not much else going on.  Dave and I went out to eat last night.  It was a welcome break.  We are going to Maryland to visit Melissa over Christmas.  Should be a nice trip.  Hopefully we don't run into any bad weather.  Since Melissa has been there she has bragged about how great the weather is and since we planned the trip they have had 7 inches of snow!  There is an ice storm predicted for this week out there, hopefully all that crap will be out of its system before we have to take off.  The sun is still shining here!  That's nice.    Well, that it!

      Howdy! Well, I was going to blog yesterday, but I got caught up working on my other web site.  So....   here I am today!  Nice to see the sun shining.    As for that poor female cardinal, she is still hanging around here and still trying several times a day to get into the bathroom window!  She flies straight at it and hits it with her beak.    An update on the contest at WHNN:  The last time I called I actually got through, but I was caller #2, 10 calls too early, and of course it was busy on the redail!  Oh well, it would be fun to win a key to try for the big prize.  I didn't bake my cookies on Friday, but I did get them done yesterday.   Well, that's the updates from here!

      Hi Family! Wow!!  I didn't  realize it had been so long since I last blogged!  Sowwy!  Anyway, here is a rundown of the week.  First of all, my house is cleaned and my bedroom closet is organized.  That's about time!  WOW!!!   I've gathered many more items for our spring rummage sale.  And...  I've made a little more progress in my computer room.  Well, that doesn't look like much when written down, but oh welll!  For the last 3 days a poor female cardinal has been trying to get in our bathroom window.  I first noticed the poor thing while getting dressed one morning.  She kept hitting the window.  I'm not sure how she got confused, but she was there again this morning, only this morning a male flew up and she followed him.  I hope she is straightened out!    I'm also trying to win $5,000 by listening to oldies 96.  I can't even get through their phone line, but today I have a plan!  If I get through I ll let you know how it worked!  Well, that's about it for today.  I think I'll bake some Christmas cookies today!  Have a good weekend!  O&O!!!

      HI! I just wanted to blog about the weekend.  It was great!  We had a wonderful traditional dinner at Mom and Dad's place.  Almost the whole family was there, with Dave being the only absent one (he was hunting!).  We did a lot of catching up with each other, so needless to say, it was a little noisy at times.  It was great to see everyone and to meet Jan's friend, Susan.    Friday we did Thanksgiving at deer camp.  Dave and I cooked a turkey on the grill, and Darrell and Dar did a bunch of deep fried munchies in their turkey cooker!  So it wasn't the healthiest of meals, but it was good!  Mary brought chocolate cream and pumpkin pies and Jackie brought the veggie tray.  We had lots of laughs around the campfire with good friends.  Saturday most of the group took off early, but Dave and I decided to stay one more night.  We had breakfast around 11:30 and then took a good long walk.  We were gone for about an hour and a half.  We were sort of hoping to see some wild life, but no such luck.  It was a nice walk anyway and there was a nice gentle snow fall while we were out there.  We came back and stoked up the fire, and a good thing too, because it was FREEZING out there!  We cooked dinner on the grill, but ate inside and then we tried to enjoy the fire for a while, but gave up around 9:30.  I'm not sure how cold it was outside, but it sure felt like it was subzero with the wind!  We went to bed somewhat early and got up early and broke camp.  Home by 11:30, but off for another visit by 2!  We had dinner at Matt and Jackie's house and played a few games of cards.  I can't believe the snow we got during the short time we were there.  I'm glad I don't have to drive in it!!!  Now it really is beginning to look a lot like Christmas! O&O!!!

      Howdy! I've been reading a lot of pretty interesting blogs.  Some are linked from a really good blog called Grumbleeze.  You can find a link to that blog above under Friends.  Don't forget to click go!  I often forget to do that, and sit and wonder why my computer is taking so long!  WOW!  Then I realize it is the computer in my brain that has slowed down for some reason!  Oh well.  Dave had today off from work because they did not have the necessary supplies on the job site.  Hopefully this problem will be taken care of by tomorrow.  So... today we bonded!  HAHAHA!  Actually we went and got some wood.  It was a good day, because the physical excercise felt good and I really do enjoy spending time with my husband.  I think with my help I may have cut his work time in about half.  We cooked a chicken on the grill for dinner tonight.  Delicious!!!  I was hoping to have leftovers for tomorrow, but no such luck!    Well, that's the update from around here!  I hoped to run into some family on line tonight, but it doesn't look like that will happen.  Catch ya all later! O&O!!!

      Well!  What do you know?  Here I am, blogging again, on the very next day of my last post!  WOW!!!  I had planned on coming on line earlier tonight, but I ended up watching a goofy movie with my hubby.  We watched "Groundhog Day".  It's one of those almost slapstick funny types of shows.  I had heard about it a long time ago, and really I thought the premise was pretty stupid.  I'm probably the only one who hadn't ever seen the movie before, but if you fall in the same group, the movie is about this weather guy who goes to the town in PA where the official groundhog lives to cover the report.  The get snowed in town so he thinks he is staying an extra night, but everytime he wakes up.....it's still Feb2!  The movie ends when he finally gets the day right.  Anyway I started watching and got hooked!  We had a couple of good laughs together!  I love that about my hubby!  We can still laugh together, and talk too.  It is good!  The only problem with watching it on TBS is the commercials!  That last commercial break was 7 minutes long!  And that didn't count the Dinner and a Movie part of the break!  They took a 2 hour movie and stretched it out an extra 1/2 hour!  Anyway, some of the commercials were pretty good too, so all was not wasted, plus the good time we had watching the show together.  That's it for now! O&O!!!

      Hi! Well, it is the end of a busy weekend.  However, I'd say we have a great note to end it on!  Melissa had her baby this evening.  She is a little girl named KaitLynn and her birth weight is 7lb.4 oz.  Melissa and baby are doing fine, in fact I guess they'll be coming home tomorrow!  We are looking forward to pics and a visit!  Hopefully we'll be able to get there sometime soon!  O&O!!!

      Hi!  Yesterday I was accepted onto the "Blogs for Women" web ring.  I'm #910!  You can check out the web by going to the link on the side of my blog.  It is in the blue area under my license plate.  There are some really interesting blogs that come up when you hit the random button, but I would not recommend all of them.  Anyway, if you have some time to kill (HAHAHA), That could do it for you!     Well, I made a big decision last week about church.  My niece asked me to sponsor her for confirmation and her church does a pretty good check of the sponsors to see that they would really be good role models.  Since my school closed, I haven't been to church.  In fact, I was a long time member of SJS, so of course with the closing of the school, I pretty much let my membership slide.  Anyway, I decided that this is important enough to go back!  I'm joining the local church up here, and I plan to be an active member.  I already talked to the women in charge of getting letters, like the one I need, put together.  She was very understanding and stated that after a month or so, she would take care of it for me.  I mentioned that I felt like one of those Catholics that only go to the church when you need something, but she could understand my reasoning.  Anyway, I'm signing up.  Dave is ok with it too, even though he is not much of a church goer.  Well, that's it for now!   Stay warm!!! O&O!!!

      Ok, in case you're wondering, I took the music off my blog.  The reason for this is, I'm going to try to get involved in the web-ring for women's blogs.  My good friend (and mother) got me hooked on checking out this web ring, but they do not accept blogs with music.  Mom was wondering why her "granni" blog didn't get accepted.  I'm glad I was able to figure it out for her!    I'm a little bummed out that this is the second day the tag-board has been down.  I hope it is up and running again soon!  Things are very quiet around here.  It is sooooo cooooold out!  Of course it is January, so that is to be expected in Michigan!  Well, that's it for now!  O&O fellow bloggers!

I can't believe how COLD it is here!  Man!  I froze just walking out to the garage!  I guess next week is going to be the same.  Bummer.  Here's an update on that poor female cardinal who kept flying into our bathroom window.  We haven't seen her for at least a week.  Maybe longer.  It's good!  I hope she got herself figured out.  She didn't die at our window either, because I checked it out.  I wanted to make sure she didn't run hard into the window and kill herself.  She really didn't have the room to do that though.    Well, that's it for now! Catch you all later, blog buddies! O&O!!!

      Hello All! Well, I thought I'd better blog, as I just posted on 2 tag boards that I missed 2 of my friends blogging!    YIPEE!!!!  My computer room is about as organized as it is gonna get!  It looks pretty good, but I still want to get all my photo album stuff in order.  I finished on Tuesday.  As Martha Stuart would say, "It is a good thing!"    Tuesday evening Dave and I went to the Lion's meeting for the first time since June.  I'm glad we went, but I wish the club was a bit more productive.  We did talk about some upcoming projects, and I will post info on some of them as the come up.  Last night one of Dave's buddies stopped over.  We had a good visit in the kitchen.  If they had visited in the pole barn I would have missed out, because I get antsy out there.  We were in 'cause the garage was too cold!   Oh well,  Matt stayed longer than he planned and as a result, I didn't get on here much so I didn't get around to blogging yesterday.    Well, that's it from here! O&O  Blog Buddies!

      Hi All! I hope everyone had a good weekend!  I almost got my computer room organized.  It should be completed by tomorrow.  I also organized all my coffee cups!  For those of you who know me, you know that I have LOTS of cups!    I'm glad folks are tagging my board.  I hope to see more messages, and I want to encourage folks who just stop by on a whim to sign in also.  I think it will be neat to see where people are from, and if there are any visitors outside of family.  Well, that's it for now! O&O!!!

Hey, remember that delicious homemade pizza mom used to make when we were kids?  You know, the kind with frozen bread dough and assorted toppings of our choice?  Well, that's what I made for dinner tonight.  DELICIOUS!!!  I forgot to buy pepperoni and mushrooms, but there was enough other stuff on it that Dave didn't even notice what was missing.  There's even enough for breakfast and/or lunch!  Yum yum!  Well, that's it for now. O&O!!

      Hi Friendly Blog Readers! Once again, I did not realize that it had been so long since I last blogged!  .... And I even told Natwi last night I was going to blog last night!  To quote my sis... "I lied!"  Sowwy!!!  Anyway, I think about all this time I've had off work, and I wonder where it all goes!  I seem busy every day, and that's good, but the task of running a home is, well, boring!  I guess when you work full time things like dust don't really bother you as much, at least in my case it didn't.  Now I see it, and it seems I just dusted a day ago, but really it was a week ago, and I have too many little things to pick up and dust under, it takes about 3 hours to get it all done.  Oh well.  I'm doing other things too.  For instance, my computer room is finally taking shape.  I'm finding places to put stuff so everything will eventually have a place of its own.  Saturday we are going to move my BIG desk so we can clean the window and vacuum under it.  It hasn't been done in well over a year or 2!  OOPS!!  See what I mean!  It never bothered me before, but now I really feel a need to clean under the desk!  I'm sure this feeling will pass, but hopefully not until after the job is done!  HAHA!  I'm also making real progress on my wall hanging for the new grandbaby.  It won't be done by the time she is born, but it should be done shortly after.  I find stitching to be very relaxing and I'm trying to get at least an hour a day doing it.  It usually happens during the Letterman show.  I'm also getting some done in the morning, because I decided if I'm watching tv, I may as well be stitching.  Well, I hope you enjoyed my ramblings, and hopefully I'll blog again soon! O&O!!!

      Well, well, well.....  This is my first post of the new year!  We have had a couple of busy days around here, and believe me, I was ready for the relaxing day I had today!  It was good, VERY GOOD!!  Nat, Mom, and I spent the day at Patti's.  We were supposed to be cropping and working on scrapbooks, but I did not have any time this week to get stuff together so I brought my cross stitch!  It was a good day of stitching for me and I enjoyed visiting with the family.  Very enjoyable!  I got some laundry done when I got home, so I was also a little productive!    THANKS, PATTI!  FOR THE NICE TIME!  O&O!!!

      Hi! I just wanted to plug a new web-ring.  It's called BlogSnob and you can find the link to the left.  Every time you visit my site there will also be a link to a blgsnob member.  I checked out some of the blogs last night and they are pretty good.  Some were quite funny.  I'll be starting a recommendation list soon.    On another note, that crazy female cardinal is back!  She tried several times to bang her way into the house through our bathroom window!  Poor thing!    Not much else going on here.  Last night one of Dave's buddies stopped by to use some of Dave's equipment.  He stayed way too late, and tonight he is coming to finish up.  I hope he doesn't stay that late tonight!  O&O!!! and happy surfing!

      Hi all!    Friday night was the great date!  We didn't do much, movies are out, because for one I think Dave would fall asleep, but really you can't talk or anything, so we just went out to dinner.  We went to Applebees.  There food has been consistently good, and Friday was no exception.  We started off with an appetiezer and told the waitress that we would order our dinner when we were done eating the appetiezer, because they usually bring the dinner way too early.  It turned out to be a nice relaxing time for us.  We just talked about stuff and laughed.  We didn't get home until 10:30, but that's ok.  Saturday it was back to the grindstone!  Oh well, the oil is changed in the truck.  I'm glad my hubby can do that sort of thing.  Well, that's it for now! O&O!!!

      Hi All! Last night I went to several blogs, but they were gone!  Anyway, today they are back so that is good.    Tonight my husband and I have a date!  Nothing fancy, but we are going out to dinner, and NOT to the BT!  The BT is ok, but you can get tired of their food.  It's Mexican and tastes pretty good, but after living her in Beaverton for almost 8 years, and that being the only game in town, it's good to have a change of pace!   I cooked a half a turkey on Tuesday, and we've been chowing on that most of this week.  I like turkey and find it to be a very versitle food.  For the weekend I am making turkey soup.    Ok, enough about food!  Ok, well, that seems to be all I could think of, so I'm done bloggin' for now! Catch ya'll later! O&O!!!

      Hi! The weather is really nice today!  I went to Midland and had to wear my sunglasses!  Even thought it is still in the 30's it feels great after the weeks and weeks of sub-zero temps we've had.  One thing for sure though is I'm glad I'm not out east!  Those folks really had the snow to dig out of.  My step daughter lives in Maryland and she sent us a pic of her car.  Well, she said it was her car anyway!  It just looked like a huge pile of snow.  And to think, she thought she would be getting away from some of the bad winter weather by moving out there!  The ice had finally cleared off of our driveway.  That's nice!  Well, I'm going to try to figure out what kind of stuff I can put in the lower blue area of my template.  It looks empty down there!  Maybe later you will see some changes.  O&O!!  and Have a great day!

      Hi All! I spent a pleasant morning yesterday with my nephew.  He was a little under the weather and his mom had to work so I stayed with him.  After taking his medicine he started feeling a bit better so we watched a movie.  I had never seen "Ice Age" before, so that's the one we watched.  It was a pretty cute movie.  Patti's dogs also were very well behaved.  Well, she had one locked up, but she said that she would have been locked up anyway, and because of that, Lady was very much the lady, as far as dogs go.  And those of you who know me, know that dogs are not my pet of choice!  Anyway, Lady stayed calm all morning.  Another pleasant aspect of the day was Patti stopped at Subway and got herself a salad, so she picked me up a sandwich while she was there.  It was nice to have lunch with her and David.    I got part of my house cleaned today, and will finish tomorrow.  I wonder how I ever did it when I was working!  Oh yeah, I had Natalie come in once a month and we made sure the house was cleaned from top to bottom!    Well, I will go now!   O&O!!!

Mom, this is one we didn't match up on, but after reading the description, I guess it could have been me, in high school, that is!  I think I've changed since then though!

      HI All! Well, I thought I'd better blog while I was thinking of it.  Otherwise, I'll think I blogged, but really didn't !  WOW!!    I never really thought of myself as much of a joiner.  But, I decided to join the choir at the church I just joined!  It's kind of a laid back deal, and that is good, because even though I majored in music in college, instrumental is my forte' not singing.  Anyway, it gets me out of the house and it is close.  I went to my first practice last night.  It was pretty interesting, and the people seem nice.  The good thing is they are not critical!  I will also get a chance to play my flute, and maybe my sax.  Tonight my husband and I are going to the Lion's meeting, yes, another "thing" I joined.  The club is a good cause, but not very active.  Hopefully that will change.  There are now 4 women in the club, and even though the Lions International has been allowing woment to join for years, the Carrollton Lions just opened it up to women last Spring.  We are hoping to get the club more involved in some projects.  Well, that's it for now! O&O!!!

      Hi! I can't believe it's been a week!  A week doesn't seem that long anymore, at least while it's happening, but then when you look back, it seems like last week was only yesterday.  I've been going to blog on a few different occasions this past week, but whenever I sat down at the computer, it seems I'd draw a blank, and suddenly have nothing to say!  I know, I know, that seems odd to those of you who know me, but **** happens!  The week was actually not that eventful.  I picked the crappiest day weather wise to travel to Saginaw.  That was Monday and the day ended with an ice storm so I didn't even attend the meeting Monday night, which was the main reason for making the trip!  I did have a chance to visit with Nat, and then I had a wonderful dinner at the folks!  The stir fry was delicious!    Because of the rain on Monday our driveway has been a solid sheet of ice ever since!  I went to Midland on Thursday to get my hair colored, and I actually had to use the 4 wheel drive to get out of the driveway!  The roads were fine though.  I did a lot of stitching this week, and I also spent some time playing around with a new program.  It will be fun to use it once I get the hang of it!    Well, that's it for now!  Hopefully I'll be back sooner this time! O&O!!!

      .... And... Even though the weather today was beautiful, the day was darkened by the crash of the space shuttle.  What a tragedy, and it really brought back that day in '86 when the Challenger exploded.  My thoughts and prayers are with the families as they try to get through this terrible occurance.  I am glad to hear that terrorism has been tentatively ruled out.

      Hey!  What happened to my archives???  Hopefully they'll be back tomorrow, not that there is anything overly enlightening in them, but still....  What a beautiful day!  I have to admit, I'm not really all that fond of the snow, but ist sure looks pretty on the first day.  There was a nice look on all the trees and buildings.  And, it wasn't even that cold out.    Dave started working on the 5th wheel again.  Last winter he replaced the floor in the back and he made a new counter top and table.  It was a pretty extensive job, but the floor was rotting out and it had to be fixed.  I made curtains for the kitchen and dining area and the lower part of the camper looks just like new!  Well, the bed area in the upper part was also leaking and the floor was getting wet, so that's this winter's project.  It won't be as extensive as last winter and that's good.  I will have to make curtains for that area, but it is only 2 windows and the divider curtain.  He is also going to replace the counter top in the bathroom.  Then the whole camper will look like new!    That's it for now! Keep on bloggin'! O&O!!

      Hi all! Not much going on around here, but Melissa and Jeremy are in town this weekend.  We got to meet the new baby.  What a doll!  Actually, she looks just like JacLynn at that age.  And speaking of JacLynn, she is getting cuter by the minute!  We probably won't see them again until June, so we are going over to Walt and Sally's tonight for dinner.    Well, Dave got his garage pretty cleaned up today!  It looks good.  Time to do a good cleaning on the house I guess.  Well, I'll start that project on Wed most likely!  That's it for now!

      Ok, well, I'm a little upset with the Upsaid server.  I posted my Friday Five on Friday, and early in the afternoon.  I even checked it later on, and it was there!  There were 2 comments, one of which came from my own good friend, granni39!  Well, they still are not back up, and I don't really know if I'm going to redo them.  I hope this is not going to be a problem, because I will have to change my spot to blogger or something.  Well, I'm going to post my Saturday Scruples now, and I hope my Friday Five shows up!  If I end up losing my Saturday post, I'm changing that portion of my blog, because I want it up and running good, for the Monday Madness!  Well, I vented and I feel better!

      Ok!  I'm almost a web geek!   I messed up part of my blog today, the part that has "Friends and Family Blogs and Websites"  When I added my links I accidently deleted a simple little character.  One little character can make a world of difference, I'll tell you!  Anyway, I spent some time this morning trying to figure it out, but to no avail.  Then I had a brain storm.  I went to one of my sister's sites and viewed her page source.   By comparing her's against mine, I was able to figure it out!  It only took a few minutes too, I thought I'd be here all afternoon trying to figure it out!  Anyway, it looks like I can still learn some new tricks!  O&O!!!

      Hi all! I've been doing yard work for the past few days!  It's good to be out and cleaning up the flower beds.  Things are shaping up around here!  wow!  Not much going on here though.  The band I play in, The Baytones, finally got a gig!  We will be playing at the casino in Mt. Pleasant on May 10.  I will post more info as it becomes available.  I'm not sure if it is a private party or open to the public.  I should find out tonight.  Only problem with the date is one of my friends is getting married that day.  I already told her I will attend the church part, but will have to skip out of the reception.  A person can go for months and months without anything on her social calendar, then as soon as one date fills up, 2 or 3 more other things come along for the same date!  Story of my life!    Be sure to check out my links section.  I'm adding the on line games I'm participating in.  You can read my answers in my other blog, also linked to the right!  O&O!!!

      This is an email I received from a friend.  I thought more people would get a chance to read it here rather than as an email forward.  I'd say there are some pretty good points made in this letter. Just my opinion though.  Samuel Thompson wrote: I don't believe in Santa Claus, but I'm not going to sue somebody for singing a Ho-Ho-Ho song in December.  I don't agree with Darwin, but I didn't go out and hire a lawyer when my  high school teacher taught his theory of evolution.  Life, liberty or your pursuit of happiness will not be endangered because someone says a 30-second prayer before a football game. So what's the big deal? It's not like somebody is up there reading the entire book of Acts. They're just talking to a God they believe in and asking him to grant safety to the players on the field and the fans going home from the game.  "But it's a Christian prayer," some will argue. Yes, and this is the United  States of America, a country founded on Christian principles. And we are in the Bible Belt. According to our very own phone book, Christian churches outnumber all others better than 200-to-1. So what  would you  expect---somebody chanting Hare Krishna? If I went to a football game in Jerusalem, I would expect to hear a Jewish prayer. If I went to a soccer game in Baghdad, I  would expect to hear a Muslim prayer. If I went to a Ping-Pong match in  China, I  would expect to hear someone pray to Buddha. And I wouldn't be offended.  It wouldn't bother me one bit. When in Rome...  "But what about the atheists?" is another argument. What about them?  Nobody is asking them to be baptized. We're not going to pass the  collection plate. Just humor us for 30 seconds. If that's asking too much, bring a Walkman or a pair of ear plugs. Go to the bathroom. Visit the concession stand. Call your lawyer. Unfortunately, one or two will make  that call. One or two will tell thousands what they can and cannot do. I don't think a short prayer at a football game is going to shake the world's foundations.  Christians are just sick and tired of turning the other cheek while our courts strip us of all our rights. Our parents and grandparents taught us to pray before eating, to pray before we go to sleep. Our Bible tells us just to pray without ceasing. Now a handful of people and their lawyers are telling  us to cease praying. God, help us.   And if that last sentence offends you, well..........just sue me. The silent  majority has been silent too long.. it's time we let that one or two who scream loud  enough to be heard, that the vast majority don't care what they want....it is time the majority rules!  It's time we tell them, you don't have to pray.....you don't have to say the pledge of allegiance, you don't have to believe in God or attend services that honor Him. That is your right, and we will honor your right.....but by golly you are no longer going to take our rights away....we are fighting back.....and we WILL WIN! After all the God you have the right to denounce is on our side!  God bless us one and all, especially those who denounce Him... God bless America, despite all her faults.....still the greatest nation of all.....God bless our service men who are fighting to protect our right to  pray and worship God.  May 2003 be the year the silent majority is heard and we put God back as the foundation of our families and institutions.  Keep looking up......In God WE Trust

      Hi! Not much going on here today!  Dave finished a huge side job on Saturday, so he took it pretty easy yesterday.  I just thought I'd better blog because I'm always hasseling others to do the same!  One of my bloggin' buddies is keeping a list of her pet peeves on her blog!  I think it's a great idea, but I'm afraid I'd run out of space!  wow!  I may put a list like that up on my other page, "Some Fun by Windy".    I cleaned the house really really good last week, almost as well as Nat used to do it, so that's good because this week I just have to maintain!  I like that idea!  Even though I have the time, cleaning is certainly not one of my favorite things to do!  Believe me I can find all sorts of things to do instead!  Well, that's it for now! O&O!!!

      Oh, by the way!  Be sure to check out the links to the right!  A few friends and myself started an idea page for bloggers.  It's called  urlLink bloggin' seeds    Also, I'm now planning on participating in a few on line games such as "This or That Tuesday" and "Saturday Scruples".  You can find my answers to these questions, and possibly more at the following link.   urlLink Some Fun by Windy   Check 'em out! O&O!!!

      Yesterday was a great day!  Some of us spent the day at Foggy's house for a scrapbook cropping day, but because I'm so behind in getting my photos developed, I went to stitch!  I got a good amount done, and it was fun to visit with Foggy, OttO, and Awex.  We had a great lunch due to the wonderful discount coupons from the bagel place.  Later I went to Sanford to pick up my hubby.  He spent the bulk of the day finishing a job, and him and his buddy ended up at another friends house.  I'm glad he called me because it was good to visit with the friends I hadn't seen in a while.  All in all, it was a great day, followed by a good night!

      Ok, Now that I can finally post some links, be sure to check them out as I add them.  Of course you can find family and friend's sites also.  I'm happy with my new template.  It took almost all of my changes without any trouble at all.  I didn't like the way the tagboard was loading, so I'm going to add comment boxes to end of each post soon.  I have to do some searching first.  I want to thank OttO and Ladosia for all your help.  I was beginning to feel like I had some sort of a problem, but now I see that it was only blogger that was causing the troubles.  By the way, I made these changes much quicker than I thought I'd be able to.  Ya gotta love the old copy and paste feature!  That's all for now! O&O!!!

      Howdy Blog Fans! Things are still quiet around here.  And I'm still trying to get that link up on my site!  Not sure why I'm having a problem with it.     Lent  Lent should be a time of reflection and a time in which we are to draw closer to the Lord through some change we've made in our lives.  I have always thought that it would be nice if these changes could be permanent.  One time, a long time ago, I think I did Lent right!  I gave up watching soap operas, and I haven't watched them since.  I've been tepmted a few times this year, but I refuse to get drawn into that addiction again.  I was flipping through the channels one day during the General Hospital hour, and I must say, I stopped for a few minutes on channel 12, but I'm glad to say, none of the characters were familiar and I quickly moved on!  Anyway, my  big improvement for this year is to cut salt out of my diet.  I'm just talking about the use of table salt, but for me it is quite a sacrifice!  I know in the long run it will be better for my health, and may even help to lower my blood pressure.  Now, how can cutting salt out of one's diet bring one closer to the Lord?  Good question, but I do know that our bodies are temples, and I should do everything I can to keep healthy.    Well, that's it! O&O!!!

      Ok!  I just wrote a long entry, and guess what?  It didn't publish.  Said I had some kind of timed out error!  That's the first time I've ever had that happen, and lo and behold!  I did not save a copy to my notepad!  Oh well, I'll try again!  About Yahoo -   I finally got into my email on Friday.  I'm not sure if the hotbar I downloaded had anything to do with it or not, but when I deleted the hotbar, I was able to get into my yahoo mail.  I liked the hot bar, so I may try to download it again.    I realize on Thursday I said I'd be posting a link to an idea page for bloggers.  Well, I have tried, and I'm still trying.  For some reason, it won't publish.  I know I got the code right because I had one of my web techs. check it out.  She had the same problem I did.  I also keep trying to change the number of post showing from 5 to 10, but that won't seem to change either.  I have tried that for over a month now.  Maybe blogger just doesn't like me!    I spent the better part of today and yesterday cleaning up some aluminum that Dave brought home from work.  We are going to cash it in at Rifkin's in Saginaw.  Dave thinks with that and with what we have in the garage, we might have about $200.  That would be nice!    I'm loving this weather!  Hard to belive that just last weekend we were digging out of a snow storm.  I had my windows open yesterday and today.  I love the smell of Spring!  Well, that's it for now1 O&O!!!

      Hopefully I'll be posting a link to an idea page tonight.  I didn't set it up, but my good friend "granni39" did.  I'll be adding ideas to it along with granni and OttO.    I wonder what's up with yahoo!  I haven't been able to access my yahoo mail all day.  I can get to all the other features but no email.  Didn't have a problem with it yesterday.  Hopefully that will be straightened out soon.  My inbox was pretty full last night, I'm guessing it is overfilled tonight!  Oh well, I tried, and will most likely try again!  That's it for now!  O&O!!!

      Hi all! We just got home from the Lion's Club meeting.  I'm glad we're getting back into it, but it would be easier if we lived in the area.  We will help out with the "White Cane" Drive in May.  That is a fund raiser to help the blind.  We were going to help out at the road race at the end of March, but that is the day Melissa, Jeremy and the kids are coming.  We'll be having a small birthday get together for JacLynn at the time, and it will be the first time we get to see KaitLynn.  Can't miss that!  Not much else going on around here.  I'm going to work on an idea page to link to this site. Look for it soon!  O&O!!!

I can't believe the snow we've gotten this month!  I do believe we have had more snow in March than we have had all winter!  I got to do some shoveling again!  Yay!  I hope it is the last time.  Things are quiet and cold here.  Well, the house is warm enough, but outdoors... brrrr.....  I'm ready for Spring!  Have a good Monday everyone!  O&O!!!

       The News:  Local vs. National   I'm all for being informed.  I like to watch the news or at least listen to it, but since I've been off work, I've become really annoyed by the local news anchors.  It used to be you'd get 1/2 hour of local news in the morning, again at noon, at 6pm and then one more time at 11pm.  Then the morning news was changed to one hour and now its up to 1 1/2 hours.  Which would be fine, if they had that much news to read, but they don't.  The same thing has happened with the evening news.  When this change first took place  I only caught about 20 mins in the morning and I was lucky to see any of the 6 pm news.  Now of course, I'm home.  I like to be informed, so I watch the news.  Well we have a local station up north where the anchors  try   to act goofy so they have something to run in their Friday morning wrap up.  They call it "The Week in Review" but they only review their stupid jokes.  It is the single most annoying spot of the day!  If the news anchors just read the news they would be able to do the whole show in 1/2 hour.  I find myself turning off the news after just 15 mins because these people act pretty goofy!  Thats the local news.  I will say that the new anchor team on TV5 is pretty tolerable.  I think because they are both new they don't have much to joke around about.  TV 9&10 is the worst!  Nationally, in the evening they have one anchor and guess what?  He reads the news!  That's it!  And, it's done in 1/2 hour!  Amazing!  Sometimes the anchor inserts his own opinion but usually he just reads the news.   I can handle that.  The national morning news, i.e. the Today Show, or GMA, is a little too fluffy for me, but at least they have a whole nation to draw from.    Well, I just had to vent.  I would probably never have been so annoyed by this if I was working this year.  WOW!!!  O&O!!

      Well, OttO, it looks like you got your snow day today!  We got some here to but not as much as you guys must have because nothing is closed around here, just as far north as Sanford.  I shoveled of the cement slab in front of the garage today for my workout!  wow!  Our neighbor was using his new snow blower.  Well, Dave will do the driveway and that will be a big workout too!

       03-03-03   Of course I had to blog today!  I always used to point dates like today's out to my students when I was teaching.  Just a fun kind of date to write out on your paper, or whatever.  I went to choir practice tonight.  I'm glad I joined.  I was telling mom about the fact that one of the flute players really didn't want to share.  Well she is way up in front, and the choir director gave me copies of all the music tonight.  I enjoyed playing, and it was fun playing with the gal next to me.  It was kind of easy to pick out parts that blended with her without playing the same part.  It sounded pretty good.  Well, that's about it for today!   O&O!!!

      I just want to take this opportunity to thank the earthgoddess!  Actually, I'm now calling her the web goddess!  I had to make a small change in my template and somehow completely messed up the format of my blog.  She tells me it was no big deal, but I'm glad for all her help!  Thanks again, web goddess!    A note about the Michigan web ring.  According to their rules, you have to live in Michigan, or else at least have been born in Michigan.  So... little sis, in GA, you could join this ring.  I think we are in on the bottom floor as their member list is under 10.  OttO, I think your site well qualifies too, because even though you do not write about MI that much all your pics were taken here, right?  Anyway, the sites I've checkout so far are pretty interesting.    Take care, O&O!!!

Currently there are 7 members, so I encourage all you Michigan bloggers to check it out and submit your urls!   Mom, I got this one from one of your recommendations.  Thanks for always keeping us posted!    ....and speaking of mom, everything went well today for her.  Her heart doctor is a really nice guy, but he won't be needing to see her anymore!  He told us her heart is perfectly normal!  What a relief, our mom is still perfect!    Well, it's late, and really it is tomorrow already, so I'll blog somemore later!  O&O!!!

       What's On My Desk Right Now?  This great idea came from  urlLink Blogger Seeds  ~ keyboard, monitor, mouse pad, and mouse  ~ pencil cup ~ a letter organizer with a mouse pad, note pads, and some pics of my grandchildren ~ a book, "Apples and Chalkdust"  and a dictionary ~ Print Shop Art CD's ~ scissors ~ pens ~ a brush to clean my key board with. ~ 2 pairs of earrings ~ blank CD's ~ a bunch of post-it reminders posted above my work space.  That's my desk, what about the shelves above?  Well, not today folks!  Mostly they are filled with books and CD's anyway!  What about my big work desk?  Well, I really don't feel like staying up that late!  wow!!! It is a huge desk, made bigger by my hubby so I have a really great space for working on my scrap books!  O&O!!!

      Well,  it sure was a busy weekend!  Busy but good!  It started off at Patti's place for a weekend crop.  I did get some pics sorted, but mostly I cross-stitched and visited.  I think everyone there had a good time and got a lot done!  Then on Sunday we had people over for cards.  We had the games start at 3 and we took a break at about 6 for a cook-out.  It was a good time and everyone was gone by 8:00.  That way we all had time to get ready for Monday.  The bonus to having people over, is I cleaned and the gathering was outside, so my house is still clean!  wow!!!  Here's hoping everyone has a good week! O&O!!!

      Hi! I've been pretty busy yesterday and today.  I helped a friend clean her house.  Those who know me might think this is kind of funny, but my house is pretty clean, I'm just not very good at organization!  Anyway, this friend is a a worse pack rat than I am!  She has sooooo much stuff!  Sooooo many collections!  And lots of dust.  Of course having two long haired cats doesn't help!  I was there 9 hours yesterday and 5 today.  And we only did the main floor.  Oh well, that was my good deed for the day, even though she did pay me.  Tomorrow I'm going to be working in the yard!  I'm looking forward to it, actually!  The weather should be nice, and all in all, I am looking forward to a pleasant day.  Friday and Saturday will find me at my sister's house.  We will be crafting!  Most will be working on photo albums.  I'll be organizing some pics, but I also plan on doing lots of cross stitching.  Should be a fun weekend.  Dave was going to stay home on Saturday and do yard work, but he is going fishing instead.  That will be good for him, I hope he gets some fish!  They say the perch are biting!  O&O!!!

      Howdy! Well, today is a dreary day, but yesterday, the rain held off long enough for us to get a really good walk in!  We had a great dinner at mom and dad's place, followed by a 2 mile walk.  (I'm guessing on the distance.)  It was great to get together with everyone.    Update on my new page:  It has some more stuff on it, so I'm going to post the link in the links section.  I will be adding to it as time progresses, so check it out!  That's it for now! O&O!!!

That one is empty now though, so the link will show up later.  I'll be posting my new links in the link section today or tomorrow! Have a blessed Easter! O&O!!!

       Lemonade  You all know the saying, "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade!" Well, tonight we were supposed to have band practice in Bay City.  Now that is almost an hour drive for me, but I went because we are not having practice next week.  Well, I get all the way there and find out that the person who was supposed make arrangements to get us in the building to practice neglected her duty!  Soo.. there are 8 of us sitting in the parking lot waiting and getting angry.   Big Lemon!  right?  Lucky me!  I have a sister who happens to live in Bay City, and because of the distance from my house, I don't see her that often.  Well, I stopped by, and they were actually home!  We had a very nice visit!  Thanks, Patti, for your hospitallity!   Lemonade!  I'm glad I went, because I debated being that the weather twinkies were predicting an ice storm.  It didn't come, so all is well!  Good Night!!

      We're in Michigan for sure! Two days of beautiful, almost summer like days, and today they are predicting freezing rain for the evening!  Yesterday we had record breaking highs of 80+ degrees!  Well, as the saying goes, if you don't like the weather, wait a few mins and it will soon change!  That's Michigan for ya!  And another thing!  Why does a pile of dishes in the evening look unbearably huge, but when you get them done in the morning, it really wasn't that bad!  I am probably one of the few people on the planet who has to hand wash their dishes, and sometimes after dinner, it just doesn't get done!  We have very hard water, and the water will play havoc with the plumbing and workings of the machine.  It's really not that bad, because it is just 2 of us, but sometimes my preparations for dinner makes such a huge mess, I just don't feel like tackling the task!  Looking forward to some decent weather for the holiday! O&O!!!

      Howdy Well, my head is just about cleared up!  That's good!  Yesterday we took the aluminum to the junk yard for $$$.  Dave was hoping we'd get $90, but we ended up with $125.  It took him about 4 years to save it all up, but it was worth it!  Not too much else going on here!   O&O!!!

      Hi All! A note about the flowers.  The snow has mostly melted and it looks like all the flowers will be ok.  The ones that were coming up were close to either the house or the pole barn, and therefore protected enough from the elements.    About my mood!  I haven't changed it because it hasn't changed!  I'm still stuffed up!  I bought some Aleve cold and sinus medicine and took one at 7pm.  I'm feeling much better already, and only hoping I can sleep with my mouth closed!  wow!!!  The past 2 nights were terrible because I was so stuffed I couldn't breath right, and then woke up with a dry throat in addition to the stuffiness.  Aleve works wonders, and I'll really be putting their 12 hour claim to the test!    Well, that's it for now!  O&O!!!

      Hi Blogger Fans!  We've been keeping busy on the homefront.  Saturday night we played cards with some friends.  We each put in 5 bucks to play, and then the top 5 scores get the $$$.  I actually came in 4th place.  Everyone thought I'd get 1st or 2nd, but for some reason the scores were all really high.  We play 12 games with random partners, so anything can really happen during the night.  I was glad to place!    I can't believe the crappy weather we had over the weekend.  Our tulips, daffodils, and irises were starting to come up, and they were all completely covered in snow.  Dave says they should be ok, I hope he is right.  All our flower beds are cleaned out but one, and the one not cleaned isn't really flowers.  It's peppermint.  I'll clean it as soon as the snow melts.  I can't believe it is April, and I'm talking about melting snow!  Ah well, this too shall pass, as the saying goes!  Well, that's it for now! O&O!!!

      Well, I'm back! Too bad the weather is so crappy!  I  just have one more flower bed to clean, and I was going to brave the weather, but it is just too darn cold!  Plus, by the time I walked out to the mail box my glasses were too hard to see out of as they were covered by freezing rain.  It's days like this that I'm glad I'm not driving to Saginaw everyday.  It wasn't too bad this morning, but our driveway and sidewalks have become slippery now!  Anyway, I decided to bake cookies instead!  I'm making molasses cookies that crunch.  They remind me a bit of ginger snaps.  O&O!!!

      Howdy All! I haven't blogged for a while, and I was going to use for an excuse that I couldn't think of a thing to blog about.  Well, guess what?  That excuse won't fly anymore!   Check out this new site:   urlLink Blogger Seeds   This site is full of ideas!  The topic below is just one of the many ideas found, and new ideas are being added weekly!   A Pet Peeve  Well, I have many pet peeves, but one that I find most annoying is people who drive while talking on their cell phone!  They just are not paying attention to the road.  I have been cut off on US10, cars have pulled out in front of me on busy streets, and on several occasions, I have noticed that these folks were talking on the phone.  When my sister and I drove to GA together there were times when I told  her  not to talk to me, because I needed to concentrate on the signs and traffic!  And she was sitting in the car with me, but when driving on unfamiliar roads and highways, a person needs to concentrate!  Fortunately she understood, and played the part of the navigator.  People using car phones have caused accidents, and I for one, would support a law that bans you from using them while driving.

      I received the following from a good friend of mine.  In fact it was the thought that led to today's  urlLink Random Question    A JUST WAR or JUST a WAR?      Apr 1, 2003 A LESSON TO MY SON by A PROUD AMERICAN, Irma Chambers      The other day, my 9 year old son wanted to know why we were at war.  My   husband looked at our son and then looked at me.  My husband and I were   in the Army during the Gulf War and we would be honored to serve and   defend our country again today.  I knew that my husband would give him a   good explanation.  My husband thought for a few minutes and then told my   son to go stand in our front living room window.    He told him: "Son, stand there and tell me what you see?" He answered "I see trees and cars and our neighbors houses." "OK, now I want you to pretend that our house and our yard is the United States of America and you are President Bush.  I want you to look out the window and pretend that every house and yard on this block is a different country.  Pretend you see that man come out of his house with his wife and he has her by the hair and is hitting her.  You see her bleeding and crying. He hits her in the face, he throws her on the ground, then he starts to kick her to death.  Their children run out and are afraid to stop him, they are crying, they are watching this but do nothing because they are kids and afraid of their father.  You see all of this son, what do you do, son?"      "I call the police, Dad."  "OK.  Pretend that the police are the United Nations and they take your call, listen to what you know and saw but they refuse to help.  What do you do then son?!"  "Dad, but the police are supposed to help!" My son starts to whine.  "They don't want to son, because they say that it is not their place or your place to get involved and that you should stay out of it."      "But Dad, he killed her!!" my son exclaims. "I know he did but the police tell you to stay out of it.  Now I want you to look out that window and pretend you see our neighbor who you're pretending is Saddam turn around and do the same thing to his children. What do you do?"  "Well, if the police don't want to help, I will go and ask my next door neighbor to help me stop him." our son says.      "Son, our next door neighbor sees what is happening and refuses to get   involved as well.  He refuses to open the door and help you stop him."   "But Dad, I NEED help!!!  I can't stop him by myself!!"  "WHAT DO YOU DO SON?"      Our son starts to cry.      "OK, no one wants to help you, the man across the street saw you ask for   help and saw that no one would help you stop him.  He stands taller and   puffs out his chest.  Guess what he does next son?  He walks across the   street to the old ladies house and breaks down her door and drags her out, steals all her stuff and sets her house on fire and then he kills her.  He turns around and sees you standing in the window and laughs at you.   WHAT DO YOU DO?!!!"      Our son is crying and he looks down and he whispers, "I close the blinds,   Daddy."  My husband looks at our son with tears in his eyes and asks him "Why?" "Because Daddy the police are supposed to help people who needs it, and they won't help.  You always say that neighbors are supposed to HELP neighbors, but they won't help either, they won't help me stop him.  I'm   afraid I can't do it by myself.  Daddy I can't look out my window and just watch him do all these terrible things and do nothing, so I'm just going to close the blinds so I can't see what he's doing, and I'm going to pretend that it is not happening."      I start to cry.  My husband looks at our 9 year old son standing in the window, looking pitiful and ashamed at his answers to my husbands questions and he tells him "Son, Open the blinds because that man is at your front door.  WHAT DO YOU DO?!"      My son looks at his father, anger and defiance in his eyes.  He balls up   his tiny fists and looks his father square in the eyes, without hesitation he says: "I DEFEND MY FAMILY DAD!!  I'M NOT GONNA LET HIM HURT MOMMY OR MY SISTER, DAD!!!  I'M GONNA FIGHT HIM, DAD, I'M GONNA FIGHT HIM!!" I see a tear roll down my husband's cheek and he grabs my son to his chest and hugs him tight, and cries "It's too late to fight him, he's too   strong and he's already at YOUR front door son, you should have stopped   him BEFORE he killed his wife.  You have to do what's right, even if you have to do it alone, before it's too late." my husband whispers.      THAT scenario I just gave you is WHY we are at war with Iraq.  When good   men stand by and let evil happen is the greatest EVIL of all.  Our President is doing what is right.  We, as a free nation, must understand that this war is a war of humanity.  WE must remove this evil man from power so that we can continue to live in a free world where we are not afraid to look out our window and see crimes on humanity.  So that my 9 year old son won't grow up in a world where he feels that if he just "closes" that blinds the atrocities in the world won't affect him.      "YOU MUST NEVER BE AFRAID TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT!  EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO DO IT ALONE!" BE PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!  BE PROUD OF OUR PRESIDENT!  BE PROUD OF OUR TROOPS!!  SUPPORT THEM!!!  SUPPORT AMERICA!!  SO THAT IN THE FUTURE OUR CHILDREN WILL NEVER HAVE TO CLOSE THEIR BLINDS"      We will fight for the right to live in freedom!

       Random Questions; Random Days... Thursday, May 29    The rainforests are important to the earth's ecological balance. What are some things we can do to help preserve the rainforest?   Well, I'd like to think that I'm a conservative person when it comes to our ecology.  I cannot directly do much to save the rainforest, but I believe if we work together to reduse, reuse, and recycle we can make a difference.  Our school also had a fund-raiser one time that sold t-shirts and the proceeds all went to the rainforest efforts.  I think we can also not use products made from materials from the rainforest, but that might be easier said than done if things aren't labeled, or if we don't keep ourselves informed.

       Random Questions; Random Days... Wednesday, May 28   Todays idea comes from a calendar called "Bright Ideas, 365 Creative Thinking Activities"    We've all heard the saying, "You are what you eat." What if that saying suddenly came true! What possible problems might be created, or on another note, what might be some humorous changes that might occur?  Hmmmm..... Who comes up with these?!?  wow! I agree, if you eat well, you feel well.  If you are my age and eat not too good, I mean junk, then you feel crappy!  I try to cut the fat from my cooking and baking.  I enjoy baking because my hubby likes the stuff I make.  I also try to eat salads daily as the extra fiber is good for the digestive system.  My body type tends to have heart problems so I am working at cutting down on salt.  I know I could do a better job, but for the most part, I feel pretty good.  I'm healthy, and I can get around.  Kids on the other hand seem to be able to eat junk and get away with it, but it will catch up to them.  Better to start good eating habits at a young age.

       Random Questions; Random Days... Tuesday May 27   Do you garden? Why or why not? How do you feel about fresh grown vs. store bought fresh? Do you think there are advantages to growing your own veggies? What about flowers?    We like to plant a garden.  I think the veggies taste better from the garden than from the store.  Even the fresh veggies at the store are not as flavorful as the garden ones.  I think the nutritional value is better too.  Farm market veggies are just as good as garden fresh because they are usually from someone else's garden.  Flowers?  We all need beauty in our lives!  The smell and the colors!  What beauty!  Well, I don't have as many as I'd like, but we do plant flowers too, but mostly we have the type that come back year after year.      Random Questions; Random Days...Monday, May 26   Humor is good for the soul. What is the funniest thing you ever saw or did?    I think one of the funniest things I've done was with my friend Donna.  We were just driving around and happened upon a real estate building in Bay City.  They had a sign out front that said, "We have calendars, come on in and ask for one!"  So.... We went in and asked for a calendar.  The gal working there could not believe we were not looking for a house, or selling either.  She had a really surprised look on her face, but she gave us each a calendar.  I've never seen that sign outside their building since!

       Random Questions, Random Days....   Today we're going to ask you a question AND invite you to add links to ALL the websites you own/manage that you would like to share with us! The question is.................How many websites (including blogs) do you manage? Do you feel 'overloaded' sometimes with keeping them updated? PLEASE share links here. We'd LOVE to visit your sites and leave a comment!!    Thanks, OttO, for posting the question, and now that I'm home, I can answer!  wow!!! I will list my web sites here:  urlLink Windy's Page for Thought  of course you are reading that one now!  wow!!!   urlLink Some Fun by Windy  - This link is where I post most of my meme answers.   urlLink Windy's Quizzes and Other Fun Stuff   Here is where I post my quiz results, and I'm also planning on starting a blinkie page.  I also have some might fine links here.   urlLink Blogger Seeds   I co-manage this page with Granni, OttO, and Bug.  It is where you can find Random Questions, Random Days...  and also many more blogging ideas.   urlLink Nowak's Notes  A web site with teacher info ans well as info for students.  I also manage two private sites, and co-manage another.  Those are private 'cause they are just for family.  Sometimes I feel a little overwhelmed, and I know I don't have half the sites that OttO has!  or Granni either!  Well,  I enjoy it, so I'll keep doing it!  Good Morning! Today's questions was suggested by Granni at Grumbleeze  Random Questions; Random Days... Friday May 23 From the cover of Time Magazine (May 26, 2003)... 'Hey, Where's my Raise?'..... 'Paychecks are shrinking for millions of Americans. What that means for your future.' So, what does that means to your future?... and that's if your lucky enough to still have a job! Please comment. Well, I'm one of the many Americans without a job!  It has hindered our life style a bit, but I'm thankful for the unemployment benefit.  That has really helped.  My paychecks were already pretty small because I worked for the church, but I really did enjoy my job, and I miss it.  I'm hoping to get another job soon, but it has not been easy.  I feel thankful that we are able to pay our bills.  I know that some people have lost their homes.  I am pretty sure I'll be able to get a job, but it will most likely not be in my field.  It also will most likely not be the pay I was getting.

       Random Questions; Random Days... Thursday May 22!    Color is all around us. People often define emotions using color. What color is love? hate? Or whatever other emotions you care to discuss. Tell why.   Hate:  When I think of hate, I think of anger.  Anger is seen as red in my mind, so I will give that color to hate.  Love on the other had produces many different emotions and images.  I know the color is pastel, but it could be pink, green, purple, yellow.  Love is soft and caring, but it is also strong.  Love in itself is a rainbow of colors in my opinion because there are so many different kinds of love.  The love of a spouse, a child, a pet, a friend, a sibling, a parent, and the list goes on!

      Ok blogger fans, I have some catching up to do!  I have been quite busy making curtains, doing yard work, and looking for a job!  Sorry, I haven't answered these great questions yet!  By the way, you can find them at  urlLink Blogger Seeds     Random Question; Random Days... Wednesday May 21    How do you feel about your alarm clock?    I have a love/hate relationship with the alarm clock.  It is there when I need it, and for that I'm thankful, but it is there everyday of the week for my dear hubby too!  Now since I'm not working at the moment, I wouldn't mind a day to sleep in once in a while, but I get up with the clock.  It's really not all that bad though, because 9 times out of 10, I'm up before it even goes off, so why complain?         Random Questions; Random Days... Tuesday May 20    Once again, today's question is inspired by my calendar! "Joy comes from within." Do you feel you are joyful, why or why not? Or, just comment on the quote.  Usually, I feel joyful.  I agree, it has to come from within.  I believe you can have inner joy even when you are going through difficult times.  I don't think a good job, big $$$, or funny jokes can make a person joyful, happy on a short term basis, yes, but joyful, I don't think so.

       Random Questions; Random Days.... Monday May 19    Let's say you stopped at a party store for a quick purchase. You gave the clerk a $10.00, but the clerk gave you change for a $20.00. You are aware of the error as soon as the clerk counts back your change. What do you do?   I would give the 10 bucks back to the clerk.  I'd hope that if the roles were reversed, the customer would do the same.  It has happened that I've gotten back to my car and realized that I was given the incorrect change.  If it was a considerable amount of $ I'd go back in and return it, or if I was shorted, I'd go back in.  If it was a few cents off, either way, I'd let it go.   O&O!!!

      Visit us at  urlLink Blogger Seeds   for great blogging ideas and a random question almost every day!  We even have a place for you to post your answers if you don't have a place to blog.   Random Questions; Random Days.... Friday May 16!    I found the following quote in my daily calendar. There is no author noted, but I thought it would be a good thought to comment on. So...  "Of all best things upon the earth, a faithful friend is the best." Write a bit about your best friend, how did you become friends, etc...    I have a good friend.  Donna and I went to college together and I met her through a good friend I met at Delta College.  That means I've known Donna for almost 30 years.  We used to do a lot of things together before I got married, but I still see her several times a year.  She has been there for me when I've needed her, and also I've been there for her.  We often get silly when we are together.  She is a fun person to be around.  I also consider among my best friends, my sisters and my mom.  Again, we are all fun people to be around, and always there when needed.    O&O!!!

If not, how do you relieve stress?   Well, I do have a habit of shaking my leg or my foot.  I really don't think it is a nervous habit, it is just something I do without even thinking about.  Sometimes I'm not aware I'm doing it until it has bothered someone enough for them to ask me to stop!  I've never been a nail biter, just a person who fidgets! O&O!!!

       Random Questions; Random Days .... Wednesday May 14    Today's question ...  How do you like to spend your down time? What would your dream vacation be?    I have many hobbies, but lately I've been finding myself either on the computer or cross-stitching.  I also enjoy reading, scrapbooking, bike riding, camping, and even working out in the yard.  Especially when the weather is like today!    Dream vacation?  I guess it would be camping somewhere in the mountains with my husband.  There would be plenty of hikes and bike rides.  All meals cooked out, and answering to no one!  No phone, no pool, no pets!  Well, I wouldn't mind the pool, but that's what I would call a dream vacation!  Actually, I had one of those when I got married.  We went out west for 5 weeks and had a wonderful time!  I have three photo albums to prove it too!

       Random Questions; Random Days... Tuesday May 13...  Today's question...   How do you divide your household chores? Including yard and vehicle maintainance.   Let's see.  I do the inhouse stuff and my hubby does out... No, that's not really right, actually I keep the house up on the inside, and I cut the grass.  I enjoy the grass part!  Hubby does other yard work and maintains the vehicles, and that includes oil changes in the trucks and yard equipment, lube jobs, and other garage work.  It seems to work for us.  Hubby also washes windows twice a year.  I also do the shopping.  When I get a job, I'm sure I'll be able to hire my sis back to help with the housework.    When we were kids we often thought that mom and dad had kids so they would have someone to do their work.  How dumb were we?  If they wouldn't have had six kids, there wouldn't have been all that work!  wow!!!  Anyway, our good upbringing helped prepare us for running our own houses.  Thanks mom and dad! O&O!!!

       Random questions; Random days...   Please check out  urlLink Blogger Seeds  to play along!   Do you like games? If so, what kind, video, board, online, online interactive? Why?   I like games!  I never really go into video games, even though we had an Atari game when we were younger, but I was never very good at it.  Most board games are fun, but I hate to play word games with Sharba!  She  always  wins!  I don't mind playing Trivial Pursuit because I always feel like I have a chance to at least do better than the last time.  I also enjoy playing Spider and Free Cell on my computer.  The thing that really surprises me, is I've gotten hooked on Internet games.  My favorite site is  urlLink Pogo   They have a wide variety of games that include, Poppit! FreeCell, and Sweet Tooth, just to name a few!  You have the option to chat with other players, but I find it hard to play the game that way, so I pretty much keep to myself.  However, when I play Euchre, I do chat with the other players at my table.  I haven't played that one in a long time though.    O&O!!!

       Random questions; Random days Day 2:   When is the last time you 'felt like an idiot' and why? Did you do something about it?    Hmmmm.....  Good question!  To answer honestly, I must say it happens more times than I care to count!  I do remember one time when I was a kid staying at my Aunt Barb's house.  It must have made an impact on me 'cause I still remember it!   She lived close enough to the store that we could walk to it.  I was invited to stay over night there and watch the kids, my cousins.  Aunt Barb asked me to go to the store and get some pop and she proceeded to name about 4 different types.  Well, I went and bought an 8 pack of each kind, and when I got back to her house she laughed because I was only supposed to get one bottle of each!  I felt pretty dumb, but she gave me enough money to pay for it in advance, and I don't think her directions were all that clear!  Oh well,  Now lets see... recently? I guess it was the other day when I picked up the chickens.  I was supposed to get the feed also, and I knew we needed 250 lbs of starter and 250 lbs or grower.  The starter of course has to be medicated because the little guys have to build up an imunity, but the grower should be nonmedicated.  The fellow at Rocket J's (feed/chicken store) sold me medicated grower too.  I reallly should have remembered to ask, because Dave made the same mistake last year.  Did I do something about it? I sure did!  The next day I took it back and exchanged it for what we needed.  It worked out ok, though, because one of our turkeys died the first day, and so I picked up two turkeys too.

You will find interesting and thought provoking questions here on an almost daily basis!  Check it out! Today's question:   Wednesday May 7... Random question...   Who is the oldest person you can remember... and what do you remember about that person? How old was he/she?   My grandmother is 87 or 86.  I'm not sure, but I think she is the oldest person I know.  I'll probably read some other family member's blogs and discover I know someone else, who may be older, but at this time, she is the only one I can think of.  My grandma still gets around pretty good.  She is an active crafter who can be found at many bazaars around Christmas time.  She does ceramics.  She is my mother's mother.  We used to go over to their house on Christmas when we were young.  I remember that my grandpa used to yell at our other cousins because they ran around the house and were loud.  We never got yelled at!  We knew how to behave, and of course were reminded how we should behave on our way there.  Even though there are 6 kids in our family and we are all close in age, we are older than our cousins, and all girls.  I don't know if that made a difference, I'm sure the age thing did, but anyway, that is one story from my childhood I remember.  O&O!!!

       The Chickens Have Arrived!  You know it must be mid-Spring when we get our chickens!  I had to go to beautiful downtown Crump today to pick them up.  It's a good thing the chickens are cute when young, because I had to take them out of the box, one at a time, and introduce them to the water and food locations!  They seem pretty active and healthy.  I hope the stay that way!    O&O!!!

      Well, now that I'm in the editing mode, I might as well blog for real!  wow!!!  I LOVE this great weather we were blessed with over the weekend.  Nice sunny days, but temps low enough to be comfortable!  I don't really mind that it got cold out at night, because it makes sleeping easier.  Dave got another chance to go fishing this morning, but alas, there were no fish!  I wonder where the fish are hiding?  Oh well, he got to enjoy the boat!    I did some stitching and some cleaning, inside and out!  Really just a laid back kind of a weekend.  Not much really going on here!  So.....  O&O!!!

       Random Questions; Random Days... Thursday, June 26     Name some colors that clash. Why might a person use these colors together?   I've never cared for orange and blue together.  Red and yellow is another combo I really don't like.  It reminds me too much of mustard and catsup!  wow!!! I think someone might use these colors together to make a point.  I think I even used blue and orange together in my photo albums once.  It seemed to work!  Maybe it draws attention to certain things.

       Random Questions; Random Days... Tuesday, June 24     Who had the greatest influence on your life? Why? Have you made an impact on anyone? How?   Ok, well, a lot of people have made impacts on my life.  I'd have to say the greatest impact is from my parents.  From them I learned discipline.  I learned the difference between right and wrong.  ...And many other important lessons.  Today I turned 47.  That's old enough to have met many many people who have influenced my life.  Another person would have to be the 1st principal I worked for at SJS.  She believed in my teaching ablilities, and even though it was difficult to get a compliment out of her, I know she respected my teaching because I worked there for a long time.  Mrs. M. would never have kept a person on staff that she didn't believe in.  As for someone I may have influenced?  I'd have to say there are 21 classes of my ex-4th graders running around!  I'd like to think I've made a difference to at least some of them!

      Hi all! It was a busy weekend.  We traveled to Muskegon for my nephew's graduation party.  As usual, Sharba put on an excellent party!  We had a good time, and stayed late.  Got home kind of early on Sunday.  My hubby and I worked in the yard and garden most of the afternoon and had a quiet evening in front of the television.  We were bonding because today is our 8th wedding anniversary and my hubby is working up north.  I'll be hearing from him later tonight, but we had a good day yesterday and got lots done.  Well, time to get caught up on my  urlLink Random Questions     Random Questions; Random Days... Monday, June 23    What is the best book you ever read? Why did you like it? Who is your favorite author?   My favorite book depends on my mood!  I love to read, and I have read lots and lots of books in my day!  I love Stephen King, James Michner, John Grishom, Danielle Steele, Mary Higgins Clark, among many others!  I really can't pick a favorite book today!    Random Questions; Random Days... Friday, June 19    White reflects all color. Black absorbs all color. Do you consider black and white to be colors? Why or why not?   I do consider black and white to be colors!  They do have interesting properties, but as far as I'm concerned, they're colors just the same!

      Getting caught up on my random questions!    Random Questions; Random Days... Tuesday, June 17    Write about your family.    I'm married to a good man.  He has 2 children who are both grown and out of the house.  My husband works in construction.  I'm an unemployed teacher, but I am working as a chashier to pay the bills.  My step-daughter is married and has 2 children and one step child.  She is studying to be a nurse.  What fun to spoil the grand kids, but too bad they live out of state!  We are in Michigan and they life in Maryland.  We usually see them 3 or 4 times a year.  My step-son lives in Arizona.  He absolutely hated our Michigan winters and he is loving it where he is.  He does body work on cars and he loves his job!    I'm the oldest of 6 girls and my parents are still married.  They have almost 48 years together!  My husband is the oldest of 7.  With large families on both sides, we seldom run out of things to do!   Random Questions; Random Days... Monday, June 16    Do cats really have 9 lives? Why do you think that saying came to be? What if we had more than one life?    I think it just seems like cats have 9 lives!  They get into many predicaments, but always seem to come out on top!  If I had it to do over, I'd probably live my life in much the same way.  The only thing I'm not happy about in my life right now is the state of my career.  I hope that changes soon.

       Random Questions; Random Days... Saturday, June 14    When was the last time you moved? What if you were "the new kid on the block?" Describe how you might feel before meeting your new neighbors. OR List 10 ways to make new friends. OR Write about a moving experience. OR About how you feel about moving, and why you haven't recently!   Ok, the last time I moved was when I got married.  I was pretty excited about that move because of the start of a new life.  I wasn't really worried about the neighbors because I was still working in Saginaw and that's pretty much where all my friends were.  I have met the neighbors but we are not very social with them.  They are not the people I would choose for friends.  I do, however, have many friends in the area, and I still have my friends from Saginaw. 10 ways to make friends: 1.  Smile 2.  Be yourself! 3.  Invite them over for coffee 4.  Listen 5.  Share 6.  Be yourself! 7.  Listen 8.  Help out 9.  Do things together 10. Be yourself!  I really think if you are just yourself, and you are a good listener, friendship will happen.    Random Questions; Random Days... Friday, June 13    Each day brings us a chance to do better and to make good. It is as though our slate has had the smudges of yesterday wiped out. ~L Bevan Jones Please comment on the quote.   I think this is true!  If you make a mistake one day, and it has affected someone, the next day you have a chance to apologize, make it better!  Even if your mistake hasn't affected anyone, you still have a chance to fix things.  God is all forgiving.  Sometimes we are so hard on ourselves, we can't forgive ourselves.  We need to learn to do that.  If we can forgive our mistakes, we can move on.  Each day is a new chance to do that!

       Random Questions; Random Days... Thursday, June 12    Ancient Greek and Roman gods were often associated with symbols that represented them in paintings. What animal or object do you think would make a fitting symbol of yourself? Explain your answer. Today's question comes from a book called "Art JOurnal Topics" by Terri Tarr-Schweitzer   As noted above I got this question from a book I have, but when I read it, I knew I had to post it!  I had to do a project similar to this when I attended college in an art appreciaton class.  I decided a music note in the middle of a symphony score was the perfect symbol for me.  All the notes played before my note represented the past and the notes after represented the future.  If you know any thing about music you know that a music score shows all the notes that are played at the same time lined up and down vertically.  The notes in line with me were the present.  I chose not to be on the top or the bottom line, but in the middle somewhere.  Nothing very important, but significant to the composer.  If my note happened to not be played, I really wouldn't be missed by the audience, but the notes around or near me would notice.  The composer would certainly notice if I were missing.  One of the reasons I chose this theme was because I was a music major, but I also felt it was a great way to represent me compared to the rest of the world.  Anyway, I still think it is a good symbol for me, as I still love music and play when I can.

       Random Questions; Random Days... Wednesday, June 11    "When you make a mistake, admit it, learn from it, and don't repeat it." ~Bear Bryant We all make mistakes.... What's a lesson you learned from a mistake you made?   I've made many mistakes in my life.  I think one of the biggest mistakes was buying an old run down house from a so called friend.  I say that because this person claimed to be my friend, but if it were truly the case, he'd never have sold the house to me.  The foundation was in very poor condition and the roof was in great disrepair!  The siding was so bad that when we tried scrape it so we could paint it, it was falling apart.  The plumbing was the straw that finally broke the camels back!  When the toilet water was coming up in the bathtub, and the rotor-rooter people told me that it would cost lots and lots of $$$ to fix I sold the house!  The lesson I learned;  check things out before you buy!  Don't get something just cause you want it!  I was blinded by owning my own home and couldn't see the problems until I moved in!

       Random Questions; Random Days... Tuesday, June 10    Today's question is from our sidebar of suggestions: Pet Peeves! We all have them! Write about one of yours.   Well, I just answered this and for some reason it didn't take!   I have tons of pet peeves, but one that really bugs me is how many people mispronounce the word "often".  THE "T" IS SILENT!!!  It is now to the point where even respected news anchors and radio announcers mispronounce the word!  I expect to hear the "t" pronounced from a beginning reader.  They are just learning to sound words out, and they are learning about all the rules of english.  I have checked 3 dictionaries and it is agreed.  the t is silent!

       Random Questions; Random Days...    On this date in 1979 Michael Cariney set a world record for toppling dominos in Poughkeepsie, New York. It took him 13 days to set up the dominoes and they fall in just 114 minutes! Have you ever wanted to set a world record? What might be something you could try? Or just comment on the above!  Today's fact comes from the book, "Dates with the Greats" by Susan Ohanian   Well, one year at the school I taught at we tried to set a world record for the longest bookworm.  Our principal at the time was in charge of contacting the world record people, and they told her that we weren't even close.  It was interesting though and the students really got into reading that year so in that way it was a success!  Personally, I've never thought about setting a record.  I'm not sure even what I'd do.

We also usually attend 2 annual canoe trips, however we can only make one this year.  I enjoy sitting around a campfire on a cool summer evening, bike riding, and of course spending time with my hubby on the boat.  He fishes and I read and run the trolling motor.

       Random Questions; Random Days... Thursday, June 5    Describe a place. Discuss the feelings associated with it. Tell an event that happened there.   Boy, there's so many ways one could go with this question!  I'm going to talk about a little school in a small town in Michigan.  It is an old and tired looking building, but it was in opperation for almost 90 years!  When I first saw this building I thought it sure could use a lot of work, but as it turns out, it is a sturdy and well built place.  But what made this building special was the people inside it!  I first entered this place in the fall of 1981.  I was a nervous young teacher then, but all the staff and students soon made me feel part of the family.  Even the parents of the students were generally kind and usually helpful.  I had my own room to decorate and prepare for the students.  I had all the textbooks I'd need to help them on their journey through their education.  It didn't take long before they had captured my heart.  I loved that job!  I really do have many happy memories of that old building.  Then on a very sad day in July of 2002, we were informed that the building would no longer be used as a school, and our services were no longer needed.  I felt much saddness about that, and yes, even bitterness towards the people who I thought were responsible.  Twenty-one years is a long time to invest in a place, and I must say, I really miss it.  I will always remember the kindness of the students, staff and families I worked with.  I'm working on forgiving certain people who lied to us.  I'm looking for another teaching job, but with budget cuts, it hasn't been easy.  I will do what I have to do to get by.  ...And, I will remember the place as a happy place.

      Well, it's been a long time since I just blogged! I have been a little busy.  My unemployment has run its course, so I had to take a low paying job to get us through.  I start tomorrow, but I'm still looking for something better!  The job market is tight though!  My hubby is working out of town during the week, well, Monday - Thursday so things are quiet around here.  Our yard looks good, but I think I need to cut grass tomorrow weather permitting.  The chickens are doing well and so are the turkeys.   Last weekend I went to Muskegon for my neice's confirmation.  It was a beautiful service, the music was awesome.  Of course, Lisa, Shar, and Geoff all played handbells, and Shar and Geoff were in the brass ensemble.  It's a beautiful church, too!  Then Sunday Geoff and his friend Paul had their high school senior recital.  They were great!  I wish I had half the talent those two possess!  Geoff played piano solos and a Fr. horn solo.  Paul played piano solos too, and then Geoff and Paul played a duet.  I'd say the recital was as good if not better than some college recitals I've seen!  Now for a question from  urlLink Random Questions; Random Days...    Random Questions; Random Days... Wednesday June, 4    There's a saying, "You learn something new everyday!" What is something you recently learned? Write about it. Is there an age when we might stop learning?.   Recently we learned that we need to put water right in the little brooder box for the chickens.  Especially when it is cold out.  We picked up 40 chickens on May 6th and it was still quite chilly here.  We put the water and food just outside their box, and even though it is all enclosed in a building, it is much chilly outside the brooder box.  The stupid chickens stayed in the warmth and some of them must have dehydrated, cause we lost about 12 of them in course of 2 weeks.  Then, since we are raising some for our daughter and her family, we had to get 18 more chickens.  We put the water dish right in the box, and those chickens are flourshing.  A lesson well learned!  Also, we should try and get the chickens a little later in the spring, but the year we tried that, we had a bad hatch and ended up with egg layers instead of meat chickens.  They did not get very big and weren't very flavorful either.  They make good soup though!  Are we ever too old to learn?  Boy, I hope not!  Learning is what keeps us young.  I believe if you don't use your brain, you'll lose it!  Exercise is good for the brain as well as the body!  :)

       Random Questions; Random Days... Tuesday, June 3    Today's question is about creativity. Do you feel you are a creative person? Why or why not? Why is it children often seem more creative that adults? Were you more or less creative as a child? Feel free to elaborate on any or all parts of this question.   I think I'm more creative now than I was as a younger adult.  I became more comfortable with my creativity as a teacher.  As I grew in my teaching, I also grew in my creativity.  I can't really remember if I felt creative as a child.  I remember thinking that I'd like to draw as well as my mom.  I'm still not much of a drawer, but I express my creativity through many avenues.  Scrapbooking, cross-stitching, web-page design, and so on.  As a teacher I was blessed with many creative students throughout my years.  I hope I was encouraging to them.  I always tried to be.  Some of these students could draw as well as any adult, while others were very good story tellers and writers.  I hope these students continue.  I think in many ways children are so creative because they haven't been stifled.  Sometimes other kids are mean, and they may discourage their peers, but for the most part, the students I worked with were very encouraging to each other.  That help too.

Couldn't the mirror at least make them less obvious?  First thing in the morning, I'm sure my mirror would suggest combing my hair and washing my face before confronting it.

      Hi all! I thought I'd blog a bit about our weekend.  We left here early friday, but by the time we stopped for gas, breakfast, ice, and beverages, it was noon when we got to our camping destination.  We were camping in a little camp ground at Smithville, just a bit north of Lake City.  The weather Friday was perfect!  We set up camp and declined the invite to go tubing down the river.  We had made the sign for our trip and we wanted to post it unbothered by others.  Dave worked pretty hard on the sign since he did the original artwork.  I just found clip art on the computer to complete it.  It turned out pretty cute though.  Later that evening we cooked dinner and enjoyed the company of the other canoers around the campfire.  We woke up Saturday to rain, but we really weren't concerned because we were sure it would clear up by 9 or 10 am.  It didn't clear up till about 2.  It was ok thought cause we set up at tarp and had a dart game, then we went down the river at about  2:30.  We took a shorter trip, but still didn't get back to the campsite until about 8:30.  We showered and ate a late dinner and again enjoyed the campfire.  Today we just got up early and packed.  Then we visited and broke camp at about 12:30.  We stopped at the Budd Lake Bar for a burger and got home at about 4:00.  It was a good relaxing weekend!

      Hi all! We are going canoeing this weekend.  I'm hoping for good weather on Saturday.  So far the weather twinkies have predicted rain for Saturday afternoon, but I'm hoping they are wrong, after all, the are wrong more often than right!  wow!!!   Our garden is doing great!  I've already picked peas (in fact they are just about done), beans, zucchini, beets, and radishes!  The radishes are done too.  Our tomatoes look good, and soon we will have some cucumbers.  I've also picked a small bowl of raspberries.  Yumm yumm!    Well, that's about all that's been going on around here, I guess I'll catch up on my random questions.   Random Questions; Random Days... Thursday, July 24   Seems to me like there have been many holidays "made up" just to sell cards, flowers, and gifts. Also to promote sales in retail stores. Currently we are hearing a lot about "Christmas in July" sales. How do you feel about these holidays (Sweetest Day, Grand parents Day, etc.) Do you participate?  We really don't do any of those made up days!  I do make a card for my hubby on Valentine's Day, but the rest of the made up days we pretty much ignore.    Random Questions; Random Days... Wednesday, July 23   What do you think about the bottled water craze? Do you drink bottled water? Why or why not?  I am fine with it because my water tastes crappy!  We have well water and it is very full of iron and other minerals.  I do not go crazy over the big fancy names of bottled water, I get what is ever cheap!  The best place for me to go is my parents house!  Not only do I get my water jugs filled, I usually get a very good lunch or dinner!  I also do the refill thing at Meijer's because it only costs 29 cents to refill the jugs.  Of course if I'm not going to Midland, I will just get the jugs we sell at the store cause they are pretty cheap too.

How addicted to your computer are you?  I have a Hewlett Packard.  It works well, and does all the things I need it to do.  I am pretty addicted to it!  I like to surf the net, blog, and play games on my computer.  I used to use it for work too.  I also like to make things on the computer, but I'm not as talented as my sister!  I really don't know how I got along without one!

      Getting caught on my  urlLink Random Questions    Random Questions; Random Days... Thursday, July 17    What is somthing that you think is beautiful but others may not agree? Why do you feel that way?   Beauty is truly in the eyes of the beholder!  Sometimes when you look at newborn babies, they are really not that beautiful, but to the parents, the baby is the most beautiful thing in the world!  Likewise, I know that I am not the most beautiful person every born, but when my husband tells me I'm beautiful, I know he means it, and it makes me feel more beautiful.     Random Questions; Random Days.. Friday, July 18    Do you have a collection? What do you collect and how did you decide?   Yes!  I have a collection!  I collect coffee mugs.  I started when I was single and I bought a mug from every state that I had ever been in.  It is a pretty cheap souviner, but some of the mugs I've collected are really unique.  Then, as a teacher, it is a gift that was often given to me by my students.  I have a rack on my wall that holds 60 mugs, and it is full.  I have that many Christmas mugs, and that many more mugs to go on the rack!  I still get mugs from friends and family as gifts, and I sometimes have trouble deciding which mugs to display.  I change my display before Christmas so I can put up the Christmas mugs, and then again shortly after.  Sometimes, if I'm feeling ambitious, I'll change the display during the summer too!   Random Questions; Random Days... Saturday, July 19    Who is a famous person you would like to interview and why? What would you ask him/her?   Hmmmmmm.... I'm not really sure.  I think it would be interesting to interview Roald Dahl, a very good author of children's books, but he is no longer among the living.  I'd like to ask him how he came up with the idea for some of his outlandish stories.  I'm sure there are other people I'd like to talk to, but at the moment I can't think of anything profound!

      I don't usually answer  urlLink What's On _____ Right Now? , but I can't seem to get into my meme page.  Plus, OttO, I just wanted to let you know that I almost forgot it was Wednesday today!  Anyway, I remembered in time, and now for the answer!   What's On your bedroom floor Right Now?   Well, being that I just cleaned the whole house on Monday, the bedroom floor is still pretty cleaned off.  I have a little pillow that keeps our door open, one pair of jeans, that aren't dirty, the afghan that goes with the pillow cause it is too hot to have it on the bed, and Dave happens to be in bed right now, a teddy bear, but he is in his right place, a wooden bike, 2 dressers, our bed, and under the bed is Dave's hunting rifle (unloaded), silverware in a box, a silver spoon collection, and that's about it!

       Random Questions; Random Days... Wednesday, July 16    This quote is from my daily calendar, "Thoughts of You". "Delight yourself in the sruprises of today." What are some of the little surprises of the days?  I find delight in little things like a pretty sunrise or sunset.  I enjoy the pleasant days like today.  It was a perfect 75 degrees today and a nice breeze.  Sometimes I look at the clouds and I'm amazed at how beautiful they are.  I also enjoy the quiet times with my husband.  Times when we just hang out and chat.  Running into my sisters or mom on line is always a delightful surprise too!

      Time for some real bloggin! Last Friday I picked my first zucchini!  Actually I got 2 of them and they were yummy!  I cooked them with some tomato and mushrooms.  We have 5 plants and I know they will get the best of me, but I'll bake and cook and try to keep up!  Such a versatile vegetable.  Today I picked the first peas too!  They were also very yummy.  Our garden is looking great.  The tomato and pepper plants are flourshing.  We got a handle on the deer so they are leaving our beans alone.  The liquid fence seems to be working.  We also have some cucumbers, onions, beets and carrots planted.    Time for some Random Questions:  Random Questions; Random Days...

I almost always give myself at least 2 hours of computer time in the evening, but sometimes I choose to watch a sappy movie instead!  wow!  I think the thing that gets most neglected is my house!  I can keep up on the yard pretty good cause I like being outside in this weather.  Plus, it is somewhat enjoyable.  Today I spent most of the day catching up on my cleaning!

       Random Questions; Random Days... Tuesday, July 8    Remember when you were a kid? We got away with asking all sorts of "Why?" questions. What is something you wonder about now?    Yeah, I remember!  I remember asking all kinds of questions as a kid, and I remember hearing my younger sisters ask what I thought were silly questions, but were probably the same ones I asked!  wow!!!  What do I wonder about today?  Lots of things!  I'm working as a cashier at a food store right now, and I wonder how all those folks can qualify for food stamps!  ...and the stuff they buy!  I know there are lots of people displaced in the work force, I'm one of them!  But come on!  Do you really need bags and bags of chips to survive?  and pop? and not the healthiest breakfast choices!  I wonder why there isn't some restrictions on what you can buy with those food stamp cards.  Oh well, it's what came to mind.

      We had a great weekend!  I'm glad we were able to get away!  We needed the quality time together.  We went out on the boat Friday and Saturday.  Dave caught a few fish Saturday morning, but we had to give it up when the rain started.  We were glad that the sun came out later in the day.  We cooked over the campfire and enjoyed just relaxing together.  We missed the fireworks because the closest show was about 1/2 hour away, but that's ok!  Some folks were setting off fire crackers in the campground.  I don't really think that was such a good idea though, as it was quite a wooded area.    We returned home Sunday early enough to  get the garden in order and laundry done.  Dave got all the weeds out so it looks pretty good right now.  The deer are eating the tops off our bean plants, but I bought a product called Liquid Fence, it is supposed to repel deer, rabbits and other pesky creatures.  It is non toxic and will not harm the animals.  I guess the smell repels them.  It will also not harm the plants.  I sprayed it on today and we'll see how it works.    Today I got all the grass cut.  It is used to take me about 6 hours to finish, but today I got it done in 4!  I'm getting faster!  wow!!!  I'm glad we got some rain last night cause now the grass is green, of course it's really the weeds, but it looks pretty good now that it is mowed.  The weeds were getting pretty shaggy!  Well, that's it for now!  O&O!!!

       Random Questions; Random Days... Monday, July 7    What inspired you to keep an on line journal? Do you, or did you journal in a book?    I've never been much of a journal writer.  I made feeble attempts in college when it was required.  I also tried a couple of times as an adult, but was never very faithful about keeping it up.  I always felt like writing exposes part of my inner self.  I'm still not very good at revealing my inner most thoughts, but I do write a few times a week.  These random questions help give me a starting base.  My mom is the one who got me started, and I did resist at first!

      Hi All! I'm actually blogging tonight!  wow!!! Things have been a little busy around here.  Our garden is in, and doing great, but we do have to water it by hand once a day, unless it rains.  I have a job at a store as a cashier.  It's good to have a job, but the pay is really low.  It helps out though.  I was lucky enough to get this weekend off... and even luckier to find a place for us to go camping!  We haven't camped at all yet this summer, and we're really looking forward to getting the camper out.  Dave did a lot of work on the camper this past winter, and the winter before.  And.. I made all new curtains for it!  It's a new camper inside.  Also, he washed and waxed the camper so it looks pretty good on the outside too.    Well, time to get caught up on my  urlLink Random Questions!    Random Questions; Random Days... Sunday, June 29    Tell how you met your husband/ boyfriend/significant other.   I actually met my hubby through a Christain dating service.  My friend had joined this service and they offered a free introductory version.  I signed up for that, and believe it our not, I had the wrong phone number down!  No wonder I hadn't had much luck with dates!  wow!!!  Anyway, Dave, called my work number and finally got ahold of me.  We talked on the phone a few times and finally met at Ruby Tuesdays in the mall.  We hit it off pretty good right from the beginning.      Random Questions; Random Days... Monday, June 30    Today's question was inspired by the book, "Dates with the Greats" by Susan Ohanian On this day in 1964, Maurice Sendak accepts the Caldecott Medal for his book, "Where the Wild Things Are." He states the book is not meant to please everybody - only children. What is your favorite childhood book? Do you still have a favorite children's book author? If so, who, and why?   My favorite children's author is Roald Dahl!  He wrote many books that children just love.  "The BFG", "Matilda", "James and the Giant Peach", and many many more!  I used to read the first two books to my 4th grade students, and most of them couldn't wait to get their hands on those books or any of his others.  I would recommend this author to anyone who has children!  As a child, I just loved to read, and can't really remember what books I liked the best.  I did read a lot of biography books.     Random Questions; Random Days... Tuesday, July 1    What are your plans for the 4th of July?   We are going camping at a small campground about 45 mins from here.  As I wrote earlier, we are really looking forward to some quality time together.

       Random Questions; Random Days... Friday, August 29   What are you doing this holiday weekend?  You can find the link to this meme on my side bar.  Mostly I'm working.  I know I have to work through Sunday, and I'll find out tonight if I have to work on Monday.  My hubby took some extra time off work so he decided to make a trip to the Upper Peninsula.  He is visiting an old High School friend.  I'm glad he took the extra days off because he is missing the big travel time.  He left yesterday around 1:00pm and will come home on Tuesday.  My secondary plan is to get some zucchini put up, (dried, baked, and frozen) and clean the house if I have time.    Ok, now I'm going to tell a true story that happened on Wednesday.   My dear husband raises chickens and turkeys.  We had a rough time with our chickens this year, as I think we got them too early, but they are all butchered and in the freezer now.  The turkeys have not ever been a problem.  Until Wednesday!  Dave was working up at Higgins Lake and he stays there until the week is over.  Tuesday morning the turkeys were fine.  I watered them up good and went about my daily business.  Wednesday morning I went out to water them up and I noticed one turkey had a sore face.  And I mean sore!  Half of his face was ripped away from the bone.  It was pretty gross to look at.  He seemed fine otherwise though.  Well, I had some errands to do, so I went ahead and did them.  Because of the one turkey, I was a bit concerned so when I returned home, I went out to check on them.  He was standing in the corner with his head hanging down.  To me he was looking pretty poorly, so I called my hubby.  He told me I had to get him out of the coop and put him in the other side.  They had to be seperated.  Well, this was not something I really wanted to do, but I went out to give it a try.  He wouldn't move with the rake coaxing, and I wasn't about to touch him so I went in and called Dave again.  He said just keep an eye on him and hopefully the turkey would make it ok until the next day.  Well, Dave knew he wouldn't be home until late on Wednesday because they were putting in 12 hour days because of the days off.  He had second thoughts and called me back, and suggested I call his dad and have him come over to butcher him.  What a relief!  I called Walt and even though he was planning on going fishing, he came right over.  He took care of the turkey and Dave brought it upnorth to share with his friend's family.  The problem was of course, if the turkey had died before he had been butchered, the meat would have been ruined.  Also, his face could have gotten infected which would have also runied the meat.  Walt said the liver was a healthy color and there was feed in its stomach so he was fine for eating.  I was just relieved to have him out of the coop.  As it turned out, it seems we had 2 toms in the coop and they must have gotten into a fight.

       Random Questions; Random Days... Tuesday, August 26   What is the most important life lesson you've learned to date?  So many lessons in life, and so many of them are important.  I think one must be prepared for anything.       Random Questions; Random Days... Monday, August 25   Do you buy lottery tickets? Have you ever won anything significant?  I used to buy lottery tickets.  I think it is mostly a waste of money.  I did win $75.00 one time, but that's it.   Random Questions; Random Days... Saturday, August 23   With school starting for many next week, and some students are already back, today's question is about school! What kind of school did you attend and did you enjoy it? Why or why not?  I attended a public school. The same school system from Kindergarten through 12th grade.  I think when I was young I enjoyed school, but as I got older, I didn't really care for it.  I was never a very organized person so I didn't keep notes in order or homework assignments either for that matter!  I remember at graduation lots of my friends were crying about how much they were going to miss the place, but I was just glad to be out!  I did enjoy college.  I went in with an open mind, and I made a commitment to myself that I'd sit in the front of the class and ask questions if I didn't understand something.  I didn't want to sit in back because that way I couldn't see if my classmates were upset with me and my questions.  As it turned out, many of them were glad I asked because they had the same question I did.  I did well in college.   Random Questions; Random Days... Thursday, August 21   What kind of shopper are you? Do you look for bargains, or do you just go in and get the job done? Do you like to shop?  I usually just get in and get the job done!  Shopping is not one of my favorite activities!   Random Questions; Random Days... Wednesday, August 20   Here's another cooking question for you! What would be the perfect sandwich?  For me, the perfect sandwich is a grilled ham and cheese on whole wheat bread!

      Ok, Ok!  I caved! I'm going to play this little blog game my  urlLink sister, OttO  and my  urlLink mom  found!  It's called  urlLink Obfuscation: The Blog Game   I am getting ready to post my 3 stories and you have to pick the false one!  Then leave me a comment with your choice.  That's all there is to it, and thanks for checking out my blog!  Oh yeah, if you want to play too, just click on the name of the game above.  1.  We have a mouse in the house!  I saw him once just recently, and my hubby saw him yesterday.  Last night while I was at work the little critter came out in the living room so my dear Hubby set a trap for him.  The mouse proceeded to the trap, licked off the peanut butter and ran off!  He was able to do this without getting caught!  As a result, we still have the mouse in the house!  Yikes!!!  2.  We have not had very good luck with used cars.  We bought a used Lincoln Town Car several years ago.  That lemon was nothing but trouble since the day we got it.  It had to have the transmission worked on twice, a new manifold seal, the AC had to be recharged at the start of each summer, the starter went out on it, the anti theft system went out on it so bad that the car would not start until we figured out the problem, the heater core needed to be replaced, and I could go on and on!  Anyway, when the car went out on us the last time, my husband spent about 3 weeks working on it to get it fixed, but to no avail!  We broke down and decided to buy new.  We got a very nice 2002 Chevy Silverado, and would you believe 2 weeks after I started driving it I got a flat tire that couldnt' even be fixed?  Well, it's true, but at least that's the only problem we have had with it.  Turns out, buying new worked out for us this time!  3.  We really enjoy  camping and try to go as often as we can.  On our last trip we were with a bunch of cousins on my hubby's side of our family.  Imagine our surprise when Dave's brother Wally announced he was taking us all to dinner!  Wally typically does not do this sort of thing, but at dinner he announced that he and his family just won $100,000 on an instant win lottery ticket!  I could hardly believ this happend to some one I knew, let alone someone I'm related too!  Oh happy day!  Please read the 3 stories carefully and leave a comment with your pick for the untrue story.  Thanks!

      Hi Fellow Bloggers! I haven't been on line much lately, as I started a new job  and  I'm keeping up pretty good on the garden.  I am going to make my final batch of pickles tomorrow!  If you know me and would like some cukes for pickles, let me know!  The tomatoes will be coming in soon also, and I'll be making some salsa and also some stewed tomatoes.  The rest will be made into juice, and my dear hubby always helps out with that project.    We went camping last weekend, but it was cut short because of my job.  I was supposed to have Friday and Saturday off, but they changed the cashier class and I ended up having to work until 11 on Friday.  We were on the road by 1:30, so it worked out pretty good for us anyway.  I had to be back by noon on Sunday so I could be at work by 2.  Oh well, we packed lots of fun into the short time we were there.  We floated down the Rifle River in tubes and we had a horse shoe tournament.  My partner and I actually won!  Believe me, it was my partners doing!  It was fun though.  We had a campfire on Friday and Saturday evening.  That's always a good time too.  It was so hot on Friday though we couldn't sit too close!  wow!!!    We finished cashier training on Sunday and will be running registers the next time we work, which for me will be Wednesday.  We will have a cashier buddy as a bagger so we will be able to have any of our questions answered.  After 2 days of that we'll be on our own.  It is actually going to be a bit easier than working at Save A Lot, because we just have to be cashiers.  We will not be stocking or getting carts!  Now I just have to work my way up the seniority list!   Now it's time to get caught up on my Random Questions.  Random Questions; Random Days... Monday, August 18   What if you were lost in a book? What book would you like to be lost in and why? How might you get out? This idea was taken from a little book called, "Bright Ideas, 365 Creative Thinking Activities" Authors: Ginny McDonnell and Sue Mogard  One of my favorite books as a child was a book called "The Velvet Room"  That is one of the few books I read more than once.  I remember thinking at the time how cool it would be to be a character in that book, but I really don't remember why.  I do remember the room the book was centered around and I always thought it would be cool to have a room like that. It was a tower room with windows all around.  The curtains were made of velvet and there were window seats in each window.  I'd get out of the book the same way I got in.  I'd just sit back and dream myself in and out of the book anytime I wanted.   Random Questions; Random Days... Wednesday, August 13   What's your favorite word processing program? Have you ever wanted to try something different? Why?   My favorite program is MicroSoft Word.  It is my favorite because it is the program I am familiar with.  I really don't care to learn another program but if I had to I would.     Random Questions; Random Days... Tuesday, August 12   Today's fact is taken from the book, "Dates With the Greats" by Susan Ohanian On this date in 1859, Katherine Lee Bates was born. She is most famous for writing the words to the song, "America the Beautiful." I remember learning this patriotic song (among many others) in elementary school. Do children still learn these songs? How important do you feel these songs are? Please comment.  I think these songs are vital to our heritage.  Many of them tell a story.  When I was teaching I taught many patriotic songs to my class.  I would hope the children are still learning these songs today.

       Random Questions; Random Days... Monday, August 11     What is the farthest you've been away from home? Have you ever been out of your country? If so, where and how far?  I've been to Europe twice.  Once in high school, I traveled to Germany, Denmark, and Holland with the Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp Concert Band.  It was wonderful!  We stayed with families while we visited and played to large crowds.  We were treated well.  The second trip to Europe was a bus tour with a friend and coworker.  We were gone a month.  We stayed in hotels, but got a good tasted of the culture while we were there.  It, too, was a wonderful trip.  As far as travel in my own country, we do lots of camping within our great State of Michigan.  But when I got married in '95, we took a 5 week honeymoon out west.  We visited Roosevelt National Park, Glacier National Park, Yellowstone, The Grand Tetons and Mount Rushmore and Crazy Horse monuments in South Dakota.  When we retured we took the kids to Cedar Point for 3 full days of fun and excitement!  That was really the longest vacation I ever had, and what a relaxing time it was!

       Random Questions; Random Days... Friday, August 8   How did you learn to cook? Do you use a recipe for everything you make, or do you just throw stuff into a pot and hope for the best? Do you enjoy cooking?  I learned to cook by doing it.  I remember when my mom went to work when we were kids she would leave dinner started in the fridge.  She also left directions on what to do to get it done.  We followed those directions and learned how to make many family favorites such as swiss steak, pork chops, stuffed green peppers, and many many more.  Most of the stuff I now cook for dinner I do without recipes, however I'd have to give my mom credit for the recipes because as I said, I learned it from her.  I do enjoy cooking, but sometimes find it difficult to plan dinners.  As long as I know what I'm making, I enjoy it.  I also like to bake, but I use recipes for that.

Pretty much took me all week to get caught up!  Also, I got a new job, a little better than the current one, but still a cashier.  At least this place offers benefits and a consistent raise schedule.  Well, I think I'll answer the Random Questions, then I'll do the memes I like!   Random Questions; Random Days... Thursday, August 7   Today's question is inspired by my GARDEN!!! Do you like zucchini? What are some of your favorite ways to use it?  I like zucchini!  One time I made a whole dinner out of it!  That was several years ago, but it looks like it may happen again this year!  We have FIVE plants!  A bit much if you ask me, but obviously the planter of the garden didn't ask.  Oh well, he means well!  He says he cut back a bit!  wow!!!  Any way, I've made zucchini lasagna, I serve it as a side dish cooked up with any combination of the following, corn, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, and various seasonings.  I make lots of zucchini bread and freeze it for the winter.  I have a delicious recipe for a zucchini chocolate cake.  I dry it and use it in soups. We have grilled it on the grill, and yes, I've fried it too, but it is not my favorite.  The great thing about this vegetable is how versitile it is!  I'd have to say it is my favorite summer crop!      Random Questions; Random Days... Wednesday, August 6   Write about your all time favorite commercial.  I'm not sure on this one.  I find a lot of commercials amusing, that's for sure.  I've always liked the old scrubbing bubbles commercial.  One of the funniest ones first ran with the Super Bowl last winter.  It was the Pepsi commercial featuring the Oswalds, you know, the one that says. "We're not the Oswalds, we're the Osmonds!"  I've never seen the show these people play in, but I thought the commercial was pretty funny.        Random Questions; Random Days!... Monday, August 4   How accurate is your clock? Are you one who has to set it 5-10 minutes ahead just so you can get there on time? What about you? Are you prompt or habitually late?  I try to have my clocks in the house pretty accurate.  They are sometimes off, but it is because the battery may be wearing down or something.  When I stayed with my sister I was confused because all of her clocks were set to various degrees of fast!  It was pretty funny, but my niece always knew what time it was.  The clock in my truck is 2 mins fast.  I like to get to meetings and work and important things about 10 minutes early.  I hate to be late!  My husband is the same way about work and stuff, but for family gatherings, (my side and his) he really doesn't care if we're late.  I'm working on him though!      That's it for now!  I promise to be a little better about updating!  Thanks for stopping by and feel free to leave a comment. O&O!!!

      I wanted to post a link to one of  urlLink OttO's  blog posts, but I really can't figure out how to do it, so check out her post for September 29.  Anyway, she wrote a very good entry about a family I know.  The news was very disturbing, as it seems the father killed the mother, then turned the gun on himself.  They have 5 children and unfortunately, this was done in front of them.  I taught the 3 oldest boys, and they already had some problems, now they will have this to deal with for the rest of their lives.  Please keep these children in your prayers.  O&O

      Howdy folks! We had a great weekend at the lake in Scottville.  We took the short ride to Ludington State Park and were lucky enough to be there on a rare day when they had a shuttle bus going to the light house.  Dave hadn't been there before so it was pretty cool!  We climbed the 130 stairs up the narrow tower and saw the fantastic view of Lake Michigan.  And we walked around the area while mom and dad took lots and lots of pics.  Earlier we did the Skyline trail too.  I always enjoy that walk.  Mom and dad stayed by the river while we took that walk because the salmon were swimming upstream to lay their eggs.  They got lots of good pics of the fish and the fisher people.  The day was perfect.  Pam, Mike and the kids also came up while we were at the park so we enjoyed a delicious dinner with them and the folks.  Dad out did himself cooking the roast on the grill, and mom's potato salad was a hit as usual!  I donated homegrown tomatoes and some salsa and chips, also a hit!  We finished the evening with a campfire by the lake.  Very relaxing.  Dave got up early both days to do some fishing and even though the fish weren't biting, he enjoyed his outings.  We also had a couple of boat rides around the lake.   Of course when we got home, there were lots more tomatoes that needed to be picked!  I made some more salsa yesterday and today I did some yard work.  The wind blew lots of pine needles around and I raked them up and put them around the pine trees.  I also cut some grass, but didn't get much of it done before it started to rain.  At least I got the deep stuff!    O&O!!!

       Random Questions; Random Days... Monday, September 22   Have you ever thought about being invisible? What would be some advantages? How about some disadvantages?  I haven't really thought about this recently, but I used to think about it all the time as a kid!  Advantages would be knowing what's going on, or what others might be saying without them knowing you were there.  Disadvantages?  Well, not too many folks would really believe you have the ability to be invisible!  wow!!!   Random Questions; Random Days..... Sunday, September 21   It's Sunday and a lot of people reserve this day for special family time; or maybe just a day to relax. Please complete the following sentence............... Sunday is a good day to   Sunday is a good day to get caught up on stuff!  Sometimes we use Sunday to get caught up on yard work and such, but sometimes we use Sunday to just relax!  This past Sunday was used to drive home from an excellent weekend up north!  Then we relaxed!   Random Questions; Random Days.... Friday, September 19   Autumn is almost officially here........This leads me to today's question. Are there any activities you enjoy doing specifically in the fall?   I really enjoy walking in the fall.  The weather is usually perfect, and I love looking at all the changing colors of the trees.  I like baking in the fall too, because I like the way the house smells!

       Random Questions; Random Days... Wednesday, September 10   What is the perfect pizza? Do you have to make it at home, or can you actually get one from a pizza shop? If so, where?  The perfect pizza!  I learned how to make this when we were kids, I loved it then and love it now!  I use frozen bread dough for the crust.  I let it thaw and rise a bit, then roll it out on a greased pan, usually a jelly roll pan.  Since I like my crust crispy, I bake this for about 15 mins to insure it gets cooked once I add my toppings.  I then put on some sliced mozzarella cheese followed my by sauce.  I just use canned spaghetti sauce.  Then I top it with scrambled hamburger seasoned to taste like Italian sausage, crumbled and precooked bacon, pepperoni, green peppers, diced onions, mushrooms, ham, and shredded cheese.  I bake this until it is cooked through and the cheese on top is bubbly and even starting to get golden brown.  I find that even though I use meat, it is way way less greasy than a pizza from the local shop.  We do have a place near us that makes a pretty good pizza, JP's on M30, but it is still not as good as homemade!  I really don't make this very often, but when I do, it's a real treat!

       Random Questions; Random Days... Tuesday, September 9   Do you have a favorite TV show? Is it one you never miss?   I don't really have a TV show that I have to watch.  I like to watch some movies on Lifetime, I enjoy watching Biography on A&E, and I like to watch David Letterman.  I usually have the TV on when I'm home alone for background noise, and I kind of got hooked on watching The Weakest Link in the morning, but I really don't revolve my plans around what's on TV.   Random Questions; Random Days... Monday, September 8   Did you know that the "Pledge of Allegiance" was first read on this day in 1892? Some people would like to see the words, "under God" taken out of the pledge. What do you think about that? Why?  I think it would be a grave mistake.  One of the reasons this country came to be was freedom of Religion.  People are making too big of an issue of God, as far as our country is concerned.  Should we remint all our money?  "In God We Trust" is printed on each bill!  There are a lot of things I don't agree with that go on in this world, and I tend to just ignore them.  Why can't the folks who don't believe in God just ignore that?  I would never try to force my Religious beliefs on others, but I wish the non believers would give us the same respect.  The squeaky wheel always gets the grease, and in this case, I think some of us believers need to do a bit more squeaking!

       Random Questions; Random Days... Wednesday, September 3    September is National Better Breakfast Month! What do you usually have for breakfast? Is breakfast really the most important meal of the day? Explain.   I really think breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  I usually eat some fruit and some toast, but on the weekends, I'm bad (but only sometimes)!  Dave is home and I sometimes I make pancakes or waffles.  He likes eggs and breakfast meat.  I try to steer clear of buying bacon, cause when I do I like to fry my eggs in the grease!  A major no-no!!!!  Otherwise I don't eat eggs!  I will sometimes just make me toast and melt a thin slice a cheese between the breads.  I do not butter the toast when I do this.  If I don't eat breakfast I find myself munching on junk all day, so I usually try to start my day with breakfast.   Random Questions; Random Days... Tuesday, September 2    What is your zodiac sign? How much stock do you put into your horoscope?   I am cancer the crab.  I usually don't read my horoscope because I don't get the paper.  I know there are lots of on-line ones, but I think they are written in such a way that they apply to most people most of the time.  I really don't put any stock into my horoscope.

I cannot stand runny snotty eggs!     Random Questions; Random Days... Sunday, August 31   What is/are your favorite website(s) to visit? Why? Feel free to share the link. I  have lots of favorites.  I like to visit the family blogs, which you can find listed on my side bar.  They are either in the links or in the drop down menu.  I'd have to say those are the websites I'm most faithful to.

       Random Questions; Random Days... Tuesday, October 28    Halloween is right around the corner! Do give out treats to kids? Do you get many visitors? Do you dress up?  Living out in the country, we rarely get a trick or treater!  I used to have some candy on hand just in case, but I think it was just an excuse to buy candy!  Now I don't bother.  This year I'll be working.  We are not allowed to dress up at work, so I'll not be dressing up.      Random Questions; Random Days... Monday, October 27   CELEBRATE TEDDY BEARS! On this day in 1858 President Theodore Roosevelt was born. The teddy bear was created in honor of him. Do you have a favorite teddy, or stuffed animal. Please share.  I have a teddy bear that I got from the school I worked at for selling something.  I have a furry cat that I won somehow, and I have a few other lilttle things.  A couple of little doggies and kitties from my hubby too, when we were dating.       Random Questions; Random Days... Thursday, October 23   Do you know any interesting trivia about your state/providence/country? Please share.  I know lots of interesting facts about our state!  Michigan was the first state to have paved roads.  Our great lakes hold the majority of the world's fresh water, with Lake Superior being the largest fresh water lake in the world.  The Kirkland's Warbler only nests here in Roscommon County, they like to nest under the pine trees.  We have the longest coastline in the US, (because of our 2 peninsulas) and also have more registered boaters than any other state in the US.  In Michigan, a person is never more than six miles from a river, stream or lake.  When Michigan applied for statehood, we were in a dispute with Ohio over a strip of land that included the city of Toledo.  Congress finally helped to settle the dispute when Toledo was given to Ohio and Michigan recieved the Upper Peninsula.  We were granted statehood on January 26, 1837.  Well, as you could guess, I could go on and on!  I comes from teaching 4th grade for 21 years!   Random Questions; Random Days... Wednesday, October 22   Today's quote comes from my calendar, "Simple Thoughts" No author is given. Every day holds the possibility of a miracle. Please comment.  I believe in miracles.  Every person is a miracle if you ask me.  Also God works through people to heal the sick and cheer up the lonely.  This world is a a miracle too, I see no way it could be an accident.

      Now I'm going to post a response to a question I found on  urlLink OttO's  blog.  It is copied right from her post below.   I heard on the radio while driving to work this morning that in 125,000 years, the male species will be extinct. Interesting, eh? They are the only ones that possess a y chromosome and they say it is 'weak and decrepit.' I thought this may interest you. What would you NOT miss about men? What would you miss?  ~OttO's blog of Friday, October 17.  Hmmm.... It seems to me that sometimes men lose their tempers a little easier than women.  I wouldn't miss that.  I also wouldn't miss the fact that sometimes the men I know speak before they think.  Things I'd miss?  My husband is the handiest guy I know!  He fixes cars and almost anything with a motor.  He is currently working on our drier as the bearings are worn out in the motor.  We are just waiting for the part which should be here by the weekend.  He changes the oil in all our stuff, including the lawnmowers and rototiller.  He can fix the car or trucks when anything goes wrong!  One time the heater went dead on my way to work.  This was when I worked in Saginaw, and of course I was only about half way there when it happened.  It was a snowy slushy day, and very hard to drive with no working defrosters!  So.... When I got to work, I called Dave.  We decided it would be cheaper for him to buy the part and take the day off to fix it.  It was an all day job and would have cost over $600 for a mechanic to do it!  He came down to Saginaw and picked up the car and left me the truck, then he got the part and went home and fixed the car.  By the time I got home from work he was just finishing up!  I would really miss stuff like that!  He also remodels rooms in the house, currently the 2 bathrooms and our bedroom is finished, Nick's room is next, then hopefully in 2 years he will do the kitchen and living room.  But the best thing about this man I know and love is that we still laugh and talk together!  He has been working out of town a lot and when he comes home on Thursday evening, or even sometimes on Friday, we spend several hours in the garage getting caught up on what each of us did that week.  We also laugh about some of the stuff that happened.  He is not only a handy guy to have around, I'd have to say, he is my best friend!  I believe the world would not be around for long if men were not here!  Just remember, it takes two to reproduce!  Thanks OttO, for giving me this topic to write about!

       Random Questions; Random Days... Tuesday, October 21   Today's question was suggested by the Bug!  How do you refer to each room in your house?  Of course the most common rooms being the kitchen, bathroom and bedroom are referred to as such, however, we still call the bedroom on the driveway side of the house Nick's room and the bathroom at that end is still referred to as the kid's bathroom even though Nick moved out sometime in the fall of 1999!  I guess some habits are hard to break!  The room I'm in right now is my computer/craft room even though it was originally added onto the house as a bed room.  The living room is just that, and the back room is the room you enter when you come in the back door.  We also have our washer and drier in there.   Random Questions; Random Days... Monday, October 20   How was your weekend? Write about something fun or productive you did.  My weekend was good, even though I had to work each day of it.  Something productive I did was laundry!  And, something fun was going to a friends house Saturday night after work for a campfire.  The weather was just beautiful around here so that helped make the weekend good.  Dave dug up irises and replanted a bunch of them.  He still has many more to do!   Random Questions; Random Days... Thursday, October 16   The Phone: Do you use your phone a lot? Do you make lots of long distance calls? What type of long distance service do you carry and why?  I use my phone frequently, but I wouldn't say I really use it a lot.  Most of the people I know live in areas that are considered long distance by the phone company, but we do not carry a long distance service on our line.  I buy phone cards from Sam's club and we only pay 3.47 cents a minute.   I think we do pretty well with that plan as I buy 1,000 minutes at a time and they last me several months.

       Random Questions; Random Days... Thursday, October 9   This week is Fire Prevention Week. Do you have fire alarms placed in your home? Do they work?  We do not live in a very big house, but we have 2 alarms.  Both work.  They are electric, but we test them out once a year anyway.  One is by our bedroom and the other is down the hall by the bathroom.  That one goes off on the rare occasion I burn something in the oven, and it is a pain to turn off, but we still leave it plugged in!  We also have one in the camper.   Random Questions; Random Days... Wednesday, October 8   Are you a fan of late night television? Do you prefer Letterman or Leno, or, do you have another favorite? Share.  I must say, I enjoy late night TV.  I think David Letterman is the best.  His brand of humor really makes me laugh.   Random Questions; Random Days... Tuesday, October 7   Here's a fanciful question taken from my book called, "Bright Ideas Calendar Activities" by Ginny McDonnell and Sue Mogard. What if colors could talk? Describe a conversation between two of your favorite colors, or, Name the colors that have the silliest, happiest or most serious personalities.  I can't really think of a conversation, but my favorite colors are hunter green, navy blue, and maroon.  I love those colors together.  I also like purple.  These are not really what I'd call happy colors, but I think they are calming.  I remember as a child I used to love to use those colors on pictures in school.  My house was always maroon and the other colors fit in as I would make the picture be night.  Happy colors are yellow and orange.  Red can be a happy color, but it is also the color of rage.  I do not like to mix yellow and red in the same picture!  It reminds me of mustard and catsup!     Random Questions; Random Days... Monday, October 6   With the Internet and email going strong, do you still write letters or send cards the old fashioned way?  I am not very good at sending out letters or cards the snail mail way.  I really should try to do better!   Random Questions; Random Days... Sunday, October, 5   This weekend's question is a bit late, but last night when I was going to post, my computer kept freezing up! Bummer! Anyway, all seems well today! Are you a religious person? Do you believe in a higher power, or God? Please comment.   I am not what you would call a "religious" person.  I believe in God, because there is no way this great earth, or even the solar system could have happened by accident!  And what about people?  How could these complex bodies of ours ever happened accidentally?  I also pray, because I believe God wants what is good for us.  I used to be a bit more religious than I am now, but with finding out how un-religious the people running the church were, I really didn't want to have much of a part of that anymore.  I think organized religion can help us learn discipline, but we really need to develop our own relationships with God.  He is the one who helps us.

       Random Questions; Random Days... Thursday, October2   October is National Popcorn Poppin' Month! Do you like popcorn? What is your favorite snack?  I LOVE popcorn!  Of course my favorite way would be with butter and salt, but that is not the most healthy way to eat it, so I also enjoy it sprayed with butter flavoring and lightly salted.  My favorite snack would be anything chocolate!  wow!!! Talk about healthy!   Random Questions; Random Days... Wednesday, October 1   Well, fall has definitely arrived! Do you have lots of leaves in your yard to take care of? What do you do with them?   We have lots of leaves, but the clean up job isn't too hard.  I run the lawn mower with the bagger hooked up and that sucks them up and then I just deposit them in the way back yard and they turn to mulch.  When I lived in the city we could just rake them into the street, and the city workers would come by and clean them up.     Random Questions; Random Days... Tuesday, September 30   What part of the world would you most like to visit and why?  I'm lucky enough to have been to Europe twice, and even though there is a world of history over there I'd have to say, I'd most like to visit each one of our states, here in the good 'ole USA!  I've been to many, but not even half yet!  Also, there are many many beautiful places right here in my very own state, of Michigan.   Random Questions; Random Days... Thursday, September 25   The experts say that the average credit card debt is $8,000! How do you feel about credit cards?   I think credit cards are necessary for some things, for instance, they sure make traveling much easier.  We try to keep our credit card debt down, and I'm glad to say, we are way below the national average where this is concerned.        Random Questions; Random Days... Wednesday, September 24   Today's question is inspired in honor of my parents wedding anniversary, which is today. Happy 48th, Mom and Dad! Are you married? If so, how long, if not, is there a significant other in your life? Write about it.  I'm very happily married to a great man I met in 1993.  We got married in June of '95 so we have been married for over 8 years.

      I'm back! Once again I can't believe it's been a week!  There was one night though, that I did try to blog, and I could not get into any of the blogs I visit.  I think it was, well, I can't remember, but I was frustrated, and I finally gave up.    My work schedule looks ok for this week.  I am at least going to be able to have dinner at mom and dad's tomorrow.  I will have to leave early though, but I plan on coming early too.  Sharba, I'll call you about Saturday.    That's it for now! O&O!!!   PS, OttO, I wanted to let you know I'm going to work on a friendship wall, but I'm still waiting for that email from you.

      Good Evening Blogging fans! Once again I have neglected my blog.  Actually, I've neglected all the blogs I usually visit too!  So Sorry!  I will try to fix that situation tonight!  I really don't have an excuse either.  Oh well, moving on....  It is good to have water again!  You may think I've dwelled on that topic, but just try it sometime.  It's very difficult to function without, as I'm sure you all know.  The only good thing was I actually had a good excuse for not washing the floors!  wow!!!    I have a job at our Miejer Store in Midland.  It is a pretty interesting job, and there is room to grow, so that's good, but the starting pay is not so great.  I have been training to work at the Service Desk and also at the Lottery/Tobbaco counter.  That makes it more interesting because in a week I am usually working at 2 different places, and this week I was actually scheduled at all 3.  (The 3rd being a cashier at the regular check out lanes.)  I expressed an interest in training chasiers to the head of the service department.  She agreed that that would be a good move for me, but told me that it would probably take until the Spring before I'd be ready and before we did much more hiring.  I guess if I can't be in a classroom being in a job dealing with the public is the next best thing.    Another good thing is I finally got a Saturday off!  Yipee!!  I didn't ask for it, but since it happened, I decided to go up to deer camp Friday after work.  I'm glad to get to spend some time with Dave!  Also, I'm told I have a late shift on Thanksgiving and also on the Saturday after.  I will know for sure tomorrow when the schedule is posted.  I should be able to spend some time with the family then, so that is good.  That's it for now! O&O!!!

      Here's the update on our water situation. We have water!  Yipee!  Tuesday was our promised day.  But they left without any luck.  So, on Wednesday, the guy told us he would not leave until we had water.  I was glad to hear this so I did not do laundry.  We were supposed to have it by noon.  Well, at 11 am they told me that they could not get the pump back down the well because there was a build up of rust on the water line.  They had to get something to fix it.  They didn't return until almost 2pm.  I was starting to worry, but when they got here the assured me that it was going to work.  By the time Dave got home from work, we still did not have water, but they had broken up the rust line and were beginning to drop the pump.  By 6pm or so we were pumping water, but it was slow going.  There was still lots of gunk down the well from the acid treatment, but the gunk ended up plugging up our pump.  The well guy told us that we might not have any water down there, and he went somewhere to check on that.  Whoever he checked with told him that if we had a strong well for 14 years, it was unlikely that it dried up.  Wednesday night, we still had no water, and I was beginning to get discouraged.  Dave was thinking we might have to drill a new well after all.  I'm not sure what happened on Thursday, but when I got home from work at about 7pm we were pumping water big time.  The well guys were gone and Dave had all the spigots in the house opened up.  He said he ran the water for about 3 hours straight.  The well guy ruined our pump, so we had to buy a new one, but Dave says after 14 years we might have had only 1 or 2 more years left in the old pump anyway.  We have lots and lots of water, but because our water is so crappy Dave had to put new faucets in both bathrooms and he had to clean the shower faucets and shower head out in our bathroom.  We spent most of last night getting things straightened out so we could take showers.  I still went to the laundry mat because Dave wanted to change the hoses on the washer.  This he did this afternoon before he went to deer camp.  Dave was kind of ticked at the well guy because of the pump, but the guy gave us a bit of a discount.  Dave also asked for a 2 year guarantee but they guy gave us a 5 year one!  He promised to stand behind his work.  Believe me, that pump will get a test this summer when it comes to watering the yard and garden!  Well, needless to say, we are happy to have water!  O&O!!!

      Howdy fans! I apologize for not blogging sooner, but things have been a little harried around here!  A week ago Saturday, we discovered we didn't have any water.  This of course came to our attention after we returned home from playing cards at a friend's house.  It was about 2 am.  Well, try to find someone to work on a well on a Sunday!  For that matter, try to find someone to work on a well at all!  Everybody we first talked to wanted to drill a new well!   Anyway, last Friday we did find someone to come over and discuss a repair.  The guy seemed to think it would be no problem.  He was supposed to come on Saturday to work on it, but of course he didn't show up until sometime on Sunday, and that was just to drop off his rig so he'd be ready Monday morning (today).  I guess well guys run on their own time zone!  They showed up sometime between 9 and 10 this am, but I'm not sure what time, cause I had to run an errand.  They were here when I got here, but were having some sort of trouble with their equipment.  They finally got the pump pulled at around 2pm, and then told me they were going to do something different than what we had agreed to on Friday.  Needless to say, we still don't have water but they guys are telling us that we will have it for sure by tomorrow night!  I sure hope so.  Going over to the inlaws to shower and do laundry is getting old fast!  Thanks, Mom, for letting me do a load at your house on Friday too!  I'd rather do it at your house, but it is kind of out of the way.  If we get water tomorrow night, I won't have to do laundry at the inlaws this week.    Well, that's my story and I'm sticking to it!  I will be updating my meme's page tonight too, so feel free to check it out.   O&O!!!

      Good evening! I just want to let everyone know that I have not fallen off the face of the earth!  I know I don't work as many hours as some, but for some reason, it seems I have spent all my time lately at work!  When I get home, I'm often tired, and if it is early enough I cook some dinner.  Today was a treat though, cause I got home at 6:00 and my dear hubby had the grill ready for steak, and on top of that, he cooked it.  I picked up some potato salad at work, so that was dinner!  Very little effort on my part!    I'm thinking of making some changes on my blog.  I think I'm going to let my meme's page go, and just do my memes here.  I really have to get going on Monday Madness, cause I really like that one.  I also like the other one, called "What's On... Right Now?"  I need to come up with some good ideas for Blogger Seeds, RQRD's too.  If anyone has any great questions, please send them my way.  If you don't know my email address, you can just leave a comment below.    My next really big project on the internet will be a friendship wall. Thanks to OttO for sharing some space with me!  I think I'll post some pics on the spot soon, so I can get my wall put together.  Well, that's it for now, and sorry for not posting something sooner!  O&O!!!

      Monday Madness!!! 1. The one kitchen appliance I just could not live without is my ________,  Hmmmm..... Of course the obvious answer would be the refridgerator or stove, but lets consider we get to keep these two item...  Then I'd have to say my FoodSaver.  I use it daily and it really works as well as the ads say! 2. My desk always looks like a mess!  Well, not always, because I try to clean it up on a regular basis, but it does tend to be a collecting ground for things I want to get out of the way quickly from other rooms. 3. The clocks in my house are always are usually correct!  But, the one on the VCR is a little fast.  The one in the truck is 3 minutes fast and that's about it. 4. The one television program I just can't stand is .... Jerry Springer and other stupid talk shows.  I'd have to rank Dr. Phil and Maury Povich among stupid talk shows, and I'm sure there are more. 5. The one television program I try to never miss is....  Don't really have one, but I try to watch "Strong Medicine" on Lifetime on Sunday's.  I don't worry about missing it though. 6. When it comes to housework, I really hate cleaning and dusting the living room!  All those little things to do!  What a hassle!  When I lived with Seeeester OttO, I cleaned the kitchen and bathroom and she cleaned the rest of the house.  We were both happy!  For awhile she cleaned here for me too, and we pretty much had the same arrangement.  I wish we could do that again! 7. If I could re-design my living room, the first thing I would do is the walls!  This of course is our plan when we do redo it. 8. I wish I had a bigger storage place in my house. 9. When someone points a camera at me and says 'Smile!' I usually do. 10. I expect I'll have my income tax done by March.

      Hey!  How about this fans!  Here it is Monday, and I'm actually doing  urlLink Monday Madness !   . I often wake up before my alarm clock goes off.  True!  I have been like this for as long as I can remember!  Now I don't even have to get up but I'm always up before my hubby!  2. I love to drive; in any kind of weather!  False!  I hate the really dark rainy nights, and I also hate driving on icy roads.  I must say that now that I'm driving a truck with 4wheel drive, the snow hasn't been bad.  3. I'd rather have to worry about staying warm than staying cool.  True!  I've always said in the summer you can only undress so far, but in the winter you can pile the clothes on to your hearts content.  4. I wish I lived in another state.  False.  Michigan is a fine state.  I just wish winter weren't so cold.  I do enjoy the variety of the 4 seasons though.  5. Multi-tasking is what I do best!  False!  6. Flying is the only way to go!  True and False.  If you are going on a loooong trip flying is the way to go, but sometimes the getting there is half the fun.  7. Budgeting my money is one of my downfalls.  True.  I never even recorded a check in my check book, let alone balance it before I got married.  My hubby is setting me on the right road though.    8. I wish there was 8 days in the week!  True!  As long as I wouldn't have to work on that day.  9. I get at least 7 hours of sleep a night.  False.  I like to stay up late, but just get up early.  Now that I don't have a job with regular hours though, I do tend to take a nap once in a while in the afternoon.    10. I'm a night owl.  I'm a wannabe night owl!  wow!!!  I'd like to stay up later, I usually end up going to bed around midnight or before.

      Howdy! I just wanted to make a quick post today.   We had a great time last night with foggy and her family and also OttO and Awex!  We went out to dinner and came back to Foggy's house for games.  Well, I guess we found out we are not as smart as we'd like to think, cause we played Cranium and I think we might still be there if we hadn't set a time limit!  Next time I think we're going to play the kids version!  wow!!!  Anyway, we had fun and lauged a lot.    I can't believe we are getting more snow!  I have to drive to work in that crap!  Oh well!  See you all soon!  O&O!!!

      Here's some  urlLink Monday Madness!!  on a Tuesday!  Slang.........this week's questions are all about slang.  1. Do you use any slang words on a regular basis? Not really, but I do use it.  2. Is there any one slang word that really bothers you when you hear others use it? I'm bothered by the use of the "f" word.  Especially seeing how young the kids are that use it.  Lots of folks use it in their common everyday language.  3. Do you have a favorite slang word? Not really  4. What are your thoughts on adding slang words to the dictionary? As long as the word is labeled as slang it's ok with me!

      I want to start this post with a great big  THANK YOU!!!!  to mom, who put the cute graphics and updates on my page, and to Nat, who made most of them!  THANKS!!!!!  It looks great!   HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE!!!   Hi all!  I just wanted to post a regular post today.  I'll tell you about my New Years Eve, as I did not participate in the photo version.  I had to work until about 6:30 that night.  That was fine, cause we had plans to go play cards at a friend's house, but didn't start until about 8pm.  When I got home I had to grab a quick shower and then put together my dish to pass.  I cheated this time because I discovered that the fine people in the Meijer deli put together a potato salad that is  almost  as good as homemade.  That's what I brought since I didn't really have time to make anything, and no one seemed to mind either as most of it was eaten that night.  We played cards until about 11:58, then we broke out the noise makers and champagne.  We brought in the New Year with lots of noise and hugging of friends.  We did have to finish our final game after that, and suprisingly enough, Dave took 4th place.  He was tied so he only got 5 bucks, but it was better than nothing.  We hung around there for another hour and got to bed in a timely fashion.  Now for those of you who wonder what we do about drinking and driving, don't worry, we don't.  I usually have just one glass of wine early in the evening, and that particular evening, I also drank a small glass of champagne, but mostly I drink water and pop.  Then, I'm the driver.  That eliminates any possibility of drinking and driving!  Now, onto New Year's Day.  I had to work that day also, but only for 51/2 hours, and the good news is, being a holiday, I got time and a half!  But now that the holidays are over, and shopping is slowing down, my hours are being cut a bit.  That's not good, but hopefully they'll pick up soon!    Well, That's all for now!   O&O!!!

      Howdy fans! Sorry I haven't been around much.  I had Tuesday and Wednesday off, and Tuesday I cleaned house and did laundry, but when I tried to go on line yesterday, I discovered that our phone was out!  Bummer!  It was out for most of the day, and when I was finally able to come on line in the evening I couldn't think of a thing to blog about!  wow!!!    OttO, I just want to mention that I didn't do Monday Madness this week because I read too many answers and I would not have felt original!  I'll catch ya next week.  I had to work Monday when we were getting all that snow, but I wasn't worried too much about it because the weather twinkies kept saying it would end sometime in the afternoon.  Well, I had to work until 10:00pm and it was still snowing when I got out!I must admit, it was one of the prettiest snow falls in a while, but it was slow going on the way home.  Once again, it makes me glad for our big a$$ truck!    About work, Meijers is changing the whole way they keep track of the drawers and $$$ and such, and I've agreed to be a service coordinator.  The job of the SC used to be to just tell cashiers where to go and when to go on break.  We also had to decide if we needed to hold anyone over.  Well, now in addition to that, we have to get change for the cashiers, do cash pick-ups, do audits on drawers, of which there are at least 6 per day, and sometimes as many as 10, and collect the $$$ from all the different departments.  On second shift, we also have to collect all the lane drawers by a certain time and put them in tomorrow mode.  This may not sound like that much, but it is an effort to get everything going on time and keep up with cashier breaks.  On Monday it was my first day to actually work 2nd shift, and I had to be out by 10 because that was my 8 hours for the day.  I was lucky to have a very helpful cashier who used to work in the cash office to help out.  Also the service manager helped me a lot.  It is an interesting job, and the time does go faster, I just need to get the hang of it.  I'm working tonight until 11, and because it is a busy night, I'll have a second SC to help out.    That's all for now! O&O!!!

      Hi! I just wanted to post an update! Sorry I haven't been around much, but I've been training at work for a new position.  This had me working more hours than I was used to, and at strange times.  Yesterday I planned to update and do MM but I was too tired as I had gotten up at 4:30 so I could be to work at 6.    We spent superbowl weekend in Maryland and when I returned home I discovered that my work schedule was all changed.  Meijer's is going to a new format for cashiers and it requires more Service Cooridators.  Our manager decided to start training last Tuesday.  That was good but I haven't had any days off until today.  Today I'm spending most of my time cleaning house!  Tonight we are going to go to the Lion's Club meeting.  Busy times around here.  I also have tomorrow off, so I will catch up on my meme's tomorrow.  See you all soon!  O&O!!!

      Hi Blogger fans! We are here in Maryland visiting grandkids and having a great time.  We left MI early in the morning yesterday and arrived here about 4:30pm.  No problems with the roads, weather, or traffic!  Let's hope we are that lucky on Monday when we head home!  Yesterday we went out to dinner when we arrived, then we just chilled in front of the TV for the rest of the evening.  We watched Finding Nemo, which was the first time I had ever seen that movie.  It was really quite entertaining.  Today we some shopping in the am then prepared for KaitLynn's 1st birthday party.  She is a super bowl baby as her birthday is actually Jan 26, the day of super bowl last year.  Melissa had a nice party for her tonight, and the last of the guests,(except for us) just left.  The cute kid got all sorts of baby dolls, and clothes for her birthday.  Tomorrow we will just take it easy as we have 10 hours on the road Monday.  Tuesday will be back to reality for us!  Dad! So sorry I didn't call you yesterday, or even send you an e-card!  I'll call you when I get home on Monday, unless it is late, then I'll give you a call Tuesday.  I hope you had a great birthday!  You must be what?  69?  That's my guess, and I'm sure I'll find out later if I'm right!  Take care and I'll post MM most probably on Tuesday! O&O!!!

      Monday Madness on a Monday!  Yipee!!!!    1. Describe what you believe is a "good" driver.  A good driver drives defensively.  You must always be aware of what is going on around you.  You should not be distracted by talking on a phone or eating.  Drive for the conditions.   2. Describe a "bad" driver (your opinion of course).  Bad drivers are not very considerate.  They don't use blinkers, they drive to close behind, pass unsafely, and often go to fast for the weather conditions.   3. Which category do you fit in? Please back up your answer. Feel free to use examples!  I feel I'm a good driver.  I have never been involved in a traffic accident.  I try to pay attention to what is going on around me.  I follow the rules of the road.  I think my driving record speaks for itself!

      Well, here it is Thursday already and I'm just now getting to  urlLink Monday Madness!   Oh well, better late than never!  I really thought this week was going to be a light one as far as work was concerned because we got our hours cut big time.  I was originally scheduled 21 hours but some people in the seniority list above me complained because I had more hours than them, so I was cut to 15!  That was a bummer!  Anyway, I always sign up for extra hours, and I was held over twice, plus I picked up an 8 hour shift from a full timer so I ended up working 34 hours this week.  Getting called into work in the morning does tend to change my routine, but I'm always game for the extra time!  Well, enough of that, and onto Monday Madness!   1. What was your favorite TV show as a child?  I really enjoyed watching "Bewitched"  I also liked "Timmy and Lassie" and "Gilligan's Island"   2. What show did you hate?  I never did care for the westerns like "Gun Smoke" and "Bonanza"   3. What show did your family gather around the TV to watch?  Hmmmmm... Not sure, but I think the above mentioned shows we watched as a family.   4. What show is currently your favorite?  I don't know that I currently have a favorite show.  I started watching "Judging Amy" in reruns on TNT.  I like that show, but I'm not home enough in the evenings to make it a weekly watch.  I catch the show in the daytime when I'm home.   5. What show do you hate now?  My husband enjoys the old movies on AMC.  He especially likes John Wayne movies.  I don't like them at all!  I find lots of other ways to amuse myself when he's watching them!  wow!!  I also do not care for the  reality  shows!

      These great questions come from  urlLink Monday Madness!   1. What is your solution for cabin fever - you know that feeling of being penned in the house all winter? On the first sunny day we open up the entire house to air it out.  This helps a lot!  Sometimes we do this as early as February.  2. Who are the people in your neighbourhood...in your neighbourhood, in your neighbourhood.....? We live in the country.  The people who used to live right next door got a divorce and the man gave the house to his kids.  The kids were stupid and didn't make any house payments for 3 months so he sold it to this guy with tons of cars in the yard, and about 3 dogs.  We don't know him at all as he moved here in the middle of the winter.  3. What's the best thing about spring? I think the best thing about spring is the smell of the flowering and blossoming trees.  4. Any Easter traditions? I try to have dinner at my parents house.  5. How old were you believing in the Easter bunny? 47?

      Hi all! If I were the type to name my entries, this one would be called,  "I Must be Crazy!"   Yesterday I had to be to work at 6:30am.  That was no problem because I used to set my alarm for 4:30 all the time.  I got up at 4:30, showered and went to work  an 8 hour day.  When I got off at 3 I had to go to Car Quest to get some parts for the truck, then I went to the credit union.  I got home at about 5:00.  Not bad, because I thought that was my total day, but at about 9:00 pm I got a call from my boss at work.  Seems a 3rd shifter called in sick at the gas station, and wouldn't you know it, I was the only one who signed up for extra hours who knew how to work out there.  At the time it didn't seem bad to go  into work at 11pm.  So, before I knew it, I did!  That was crazy!  There was enough to do there to keep me awake, but the time really did drag.  I got home at about 7:30 this morning.  See what I mean?  I must be crazy!  wow!!!Well, I got some sleep this morning, but now I'm awake.  Well, that's it for now!  O&O!!!  P. S.  A big thank-you to the blog goddess, who updated my page!  It looks wonderful!

       How many hours do you spend per week doing the following things? Have a great week!! And thanks for playing Monday Madness!! =)    1. Watching television ~ More time than I should that's for sure, I'd say about 20. 2. Sitting at the computer. ~ Here I'll say not enough!  My answer is 14. 3. Reading a book ~ Again, not enough, but I do try to get in about an hour a day, so I'd have to say 7. 4. House work ~ Not enough!  wow!!! Probably around 7-10, but most of it is daily maintenance like dishes and laundry.  Probably only about 3 hours doing the actual cleaning. 5. Cooking ~ 7-10 6. Eating ~ 7?  I'm guessing here, as I've never really timed us, but it would be less than the cooking time. 7. Driving ~ 10 8. Working outside of your home ~ 25-40. 9. Blogging ~ about 2-3, which really isn't enough. 10. Sleeping  ~ 42, averaging about 6 per night, but some nights more and some less.

      Hi Blogger Fans!  I'm afraid I may have lost a few due to the fact I haven't blogged in more than a week!  OttO, sorry I missed  urlLink Monday Madness  last week.  Anyway, I'm actually doing this weeks on Monday!  Here's hoping everyone has a great week! Using the letters in the word 'blogger' describe your blog for us.  Boring, sometimes, but not always!  I just need to do this more often. Light hearted Often forgotten about!  Sorry!!! Good place for me to jump start my web surfing! Great links to some other blogs. Easy to read Red!  At least on top!  wow!!!   Now here's a post for the day! I have been working some really strange hours at work.  I've had to work a couple of 3rd shifts over the past few weeks, and that really messes up my schedule for doing things at home!  It's not really an excuse for not blogging, cause I know some people who are lots busier than me, but that's what's been going on around here.  We got part of our garden in already though!  We planted peas, onions, beets and radishes.  The peas are already starting to sprout.  Dave tells me these plants do well in cooler weather.  We've also been eating some fresh asparagus.  Yum!  That's it for now! O&O!!!

      Howdy Blogger Fans! I don't really  want  to be a once a week blogger, but lately that's what I seem to be doing!  Oh well, sometimes I just can't think of a thing to blog about and when I can, I can't seem to find the time.  I know it is a poor excuse, but that's my story and I'm sticking to it!  wow!!!   Anyway, we had a great weekend getting things done around the yard.  We cleaned flower beds, and we also thatched and vacuumed up the lawn!  Sounds funny I know, but once we pulled up the dead grass we had to suck it up!  It all went into the garden, which Dave is already starting to prepare for  peas.  I really enjoyed working out in the yard with my honey!  Sunday I was supposed to work from 10am to 6:30, but got called in at 6 am.  Of course I didn't get there until about 6:30, but they were glad I made it at all as the morning service coordinator called in sick.  But it was good for me as I got home from work 3 1/2 hours earlier than planned.  The only problem was I was just too tired to blog that day, and as one of my blogging sisters already noted, Sunday was 04/04/04.  I really planned to post an article that day, but went to bed instead.  I had today off, but I have to work the next 6 days in a row.  I'll get 40 hours this week though, and that is a good thing.  Now for some Monday Madness.  1. What makes your country special?  We are blessed with many freedoms and priveleges that others don't have.  I appreciate my right to vote, and am disheartened by the number of adults who don't vote because they feel their single vote doesn't really count.  Many people fought for this country to gain the rights we have, and we should be sure to exercise them!   2. What makes your hometown special?  My parents still live there.  Freeland is a nice community and they usually have the cheapest gas in the tri-city area!  But, I'd have to say, that fact that family still resides there is what makes it special.   3. What makes your neighborhood special?  I love our little piece of land!  We have nice flowers and a big garden in the summer.  We are already seeing the tips of tulips, daffodils, and irises!  I love spring!  We raise chickens and turkeys in the summer too.  The coop is way in the back yard so the smell does not affect us, and it looks quaint in the back yard.   4. And your loved ones - what is it about them???  My husband is special because he takes care of most of our repairs and he does special things for me.  We still sit around in the evening and chat like we did while dating.  He is caring and loving, along with being quite the handy man!  My parents are great people!  They raised a great group of kids, 6 girls to be exact, and we all turned out pretty good.  My sisters are special each in her own way.  We are spread out, but we do keep in touch.  Many of us blog and that helps!  Then I could go on and on about my wonderful nieces and nephews, because they are, but I'll save that for another day.  I'm blessed with a great family.   5. And finally you - what is it that is unique about you...???  I think I am a good communicator.  In other words, I work well with people.  I'm a musician, I play flute, clarinet, and tenor saxophone.  I also play the baritone sax in a big band I'm in, but we haven't had any jobs lately.  Oh, and I'm a pretty good cook too!

      1. I started blogging June 23, 2002.  (I just went to check it out.) 2. I try to post a new entry in my blog about every few days, but it usually ends up being about once a week. 3. I read about 10 blogs on a regular basis. 4. I change my layout about once a year, but the last few times our favorite blog farie took care of it!   5. I used to watch a lot more TV, and now I blog instead. 6. I spend more time blogging than I do cleaning house. 7. I tend to blog (and visit blogs) most in the early morning or evening. 8. The thing I enjoy most about blogging is the fact that it is a good way to keep friends and family informed. These great questions are from  urlLink Monday Madness!!

      What a rainy day!   When is a person supposed to get the grass cut?  Well, I started this morning at about 11:00 am.  It was a bit iffy because the grass was still damp and we had sprinkles until about noon.  I was able to get the whole front yard cut before the rain started at about 2.  I hope it dries up soon, as I still have the back yard to do!  Oh well, at least the grass is green!

      I found this list at  urlLink OttO's .  She found it someplace else.  I thought these were pretty good for a post.  I am: a wife, sister, friend  I think: too much about some things, and not enough about others.  I know: a lot about some topics and not too much about other things. I want: a better job  I have: many blessings I wish: our school could have been saved I hate: MILK!!! I miss: teaching I fear: the unknown I feel: good today.  The sun is shining and it's not too hot out. I hear: the tv in the background I smell: popcorn I crave: chocolate I search: for my keys, often! I wonder: how much longer I'll be able to think of questions for Random Questions; Random Days... I pretend: to be happy sometimes when I'm not. I regret: not acting sooner when we figured out the problems at our school would eventually close us down. I love: my family, and chocolate! I long: for freedom of money worries. I care: what happens to this earth when I'm no longer on it. I always: try to look at the bright side of things. I am not: perfect I believe: in God I promise: to be a better house keeper I dance: for the fun of it I sing: for the fun of it too, and I don't think I'm as bad as I thought I was when I was a youngster I cry: at sad movies.   I am not always: right! I fight: verbally I write: not enough I try: patient I never: thought I'd get married, until I met Dave I confuse: (can't really think of an answer, but if I do I'll post it.)  I listen: 99.7, and easy listening, jazz, and soft rock I can usually be found: at Meijer's or at home I hide: my gray hairs, but not very well  I am scared: of rats!

       1. Do you collect anything?  Yes!  I'm really a collector of stuff, lots of it!  I have a coffee cup collection.  I would like to one day have one from each state.  I have a huge collection of cross stitch books and other craft stuff too.  I have lots of photo album supplies.  I started collecting apple themed items for the kitchen.  hmmmmmm.. I'm sure if you asked my husband, the list would go on and on! 2 . How many items do you have in your collection?  Let's see, I'm sure some would think this ridiculous, but I must have close to 300 coffee cups.  That would include my Christmas mug collection.    3. What is the most unusual piece in your collection?  It's not that easy to find an unusual coffee cup.  I have a cup from every place I've been since about the age of 25.  I also have many teacher themed mugs because they were gifts from students.  One year I asked my mom for a cup that had my name written on it, first and last, and that's a unique mug.  I have it by my desk filled with pens and pencils.   and one more for good measure...  4. Is there anything you don't collect that you would like to collect?  Where would I put it?  wow!!!  That concludes this weeks Monday Madness, compliments of OttO!   Here is my post for the week:  Things have been going pretty well at work.  I've been working about 38 hours per week since about mid Feb.  This is a good thing.  Today I got called in, that brought me up to 38 hours this week.  The only thing about this job is I have open availability, which means I'll work any hours they need.  So this past Sunday I worked from 2:30 pm to 11pm.  Then on Monday I had to be there by 6 am for another 8 hour shift.  Considering road time, I only got about 4 1/2 hours of sleep on Sunday night.  Boy was I tired when I got home from work yesterday!  I did get a second wind sometime around 11pm, and checked emails and stuff, but that was really all the computer time I could do.    Things are going pretty well around here.  Dave is just about finished with the remodel of Nick's bedroom.  Of course the decorating stuff will have to wait a bit, but at least we will soon be able to get some of the stuff from that room out of the living room!  The garden is looking pretty good.  We have been eating fresh asparagus for about a week now.  And yesterday Dave dug up some sweet onions for dinner.  Very delicious.  Well, that's it for now!  I'll post the list Otto has tomorrow.   O&O!!!

      Howdy blogger fans! Oh My Gosh!!!  I can't believe it has been so long since I last posted!  I must apologize to my readers, I hope you haven't given up on me. I've been working quite a few hours at Meijer's, but I know that is no excuse.  My hours are kind of crazy though.  Sometimes I work until 11 at night, then I'll have to go in at 6 in the morning.  That doesn't happen too often though.  Sometimes I work 9:30 pm until 6:00 am.  That's the worst because I always feel like I wasted too much time sleeping when I get home.  Well, enough of that! I have today off, and as many of you may already know, it is my birthday.  I decided to spend at least part of the day doing stuff I want and not stuff that needs to be done.  Later, if the weather cooperates, I will cut grass.  That needs to be done, but it is something I enjoy doing anyway.  Dave and I are going out to dinner tonight.   Now it's time for some  urlLink Monday Madness!!!  Do you prefer.... 1. Long hair or Short hair - on the longer side 2. Contacts or Glasses - glasses 3. Spring or Autumn - Both really, but I think spring comes out on top. 4. Mittens or Gloves - gloves for working and driving, mittens for keeping warm. 5. Car or Truck/SUV - truck 6. Mac or Windows - windows 7. Cats or Dogs - cats 8. Rock or Jazz - jazz 9. Pen or Pencil - pen 10. DVD's or VHS's - vhs  Now I'm going to do last week's!  This one is in honor of MM 1 year anniversary.  Congrats to OttO who has developed a great following!  Using the following letters, name birthday-related words; nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, phrases; they are all allowed! Have fun!! =)  H - honor A - aging P - party P - paper hats Y - yearly  B - big cake I - independence R - remarkable T - totally cool! H - personal Holiday! D - delicious treats A - acquiring wisdom Y - yummy dinner

We have planted peas, corn, onions, radishes, beans, cucumbers, zucchini, pie pumpkins, musk melons, and lettuce.  We still plan to get some tomato plants, many types of peppers and some celery.  3. What is your favorite summertime beverage?  An ice cold glass of diet cola.  4. How many times a year do you rearrange your living room?  I don't rearrange because we have a small space to work with.  5. How fast do you drive in a '55 mile-an-hour' zone?  59mph  6. How many minutes per day do you usually talk on the phone?

Lots, but no where near what my sister Sharba owns!  9. How many memes do you participate in on a regular basis?  This would be it, but hopefully I'll get back into some of my other favorites.  10. Name 3 blogs that you have on your 'blogroll' list. (any 3.)  I don't really have a blogroll list, but I have listed links to all of my family blogs.  The can be found to the right.

      1. What was the name of the last movie you watched (dvd, vhs, theatre, or tv)? Hmmmm....  I've been getting ready for my rummage sale, working, and running the rummage sale since about Tuesday of last week.

Are you a morning person or a night owl? I'm a morning person, but I'd like to be both!  wow!!!  10. Did you enjoy your weekend? Even though I was either working, running the rummage sale, or sleeping, I did enjoy the weekend.  These great questions are from:     urlLink Monday Madness!!!

I promised to share some info about a possible new business venture.  My friend Deb and I are thinking of selling gourmet doggy treats.  We think it will be successful.  We are looking to get into stores like 7-11 and other convience stores.  We are also looking into pet shops and vet offices.    Well, I will now do  urlLink Monday Madness!!  1. I like my job.
