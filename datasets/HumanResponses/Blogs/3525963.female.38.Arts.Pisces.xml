      I am barbaric at times. I want to see the cop get kicked in the head and hit 11x by the same flashlight.  there is a new "Zero Tolerance" policy regarding festive parties of more than 50 people! - welcome to L.A.- if you are tan, brown, dark brown or olive skinned...not wealthy- you don't get to gather and celebrate.

      fruity fast strange sleep morning pre-coffee caught myself dancing to hold muse- ack going to teach in an hour would rather lay on the couch and listen to the construction next door- it(construction) sounds like heavy rain today.

      bad news Many Americans desperately clinging to the middle class (in debt), and the fast growing lower classes, are feeling a dis- ease. Feeling things are spiralling out of control in this country...like our pockets have been picked and the thief has our house keys...  It's just not safe for any of us(please, I know safety is an illusion- consider this a warning)if the Republican Party goes about the election the way it happened 4 years ago. They have to lose and Kerry has to be better. The (un)patriot act must be removed.   these days I am reminded of Hand Maids Tale and 1984. The have and the have mores...the media control...the media control....the media control...small bookstores have been pushed out of existence like cord phones, my sons generation has never seen...no need to burn books when you can prevent the printing of them. Certain Governors (Arnold) preventing lower income students from University education...if there is a draft...the financially poor (spiritually rich) must fight...  "News" programs owned and run by 4, or are we down to 2 companies now? Very wealthy companies...wealth gained in sick, twisted ways I've glimpsed. We are listening to music and "news" they want us to hear. Notice there are no popular rap artists who rap about the carpool in Calabasis (Dre', we know all about your suburban, family man existence). Why portray intelligence and soulfulness...?   skillful...professional manipulation....  conglomorates need to be taxed...regulations need to be imposed on them...  aren't any of the skilled intellectuals they've hired thinking to prevent REVOLUTION? Or do we seem more numb than we are?   My intuition works with my instict to fight "conservative", televised reporting. Bush joked "A dictatorship would be easier"....not in this country, not if I have anything to say or do about it...and we do we do as Matriarchs do... 1/2 off my YOGA classes with every voters registration or shared political information... the teens I volunteer with create art with information provided by the Yoga students...We walk door to door sharing the art and asking for books to share...the spiral contains within it REBIRTH

      Los Angeles loves a good car chase- there is one happening in Carson right now- we televise them - un cut unashamed at how ridiculous the whole scene is as driver,pursuer, viewer...(turned TV off)  Once in awhile, we get to see police brutality...authorities involved feel the need to investigate what is obvious from yesterdays show.  I'm off to see Faherheit 911  none of this is cheerful...only some of this feels real

      My desktop was plugged into a surge protecter that didn't (protect). I was out for less than an hour and left her to sleep, rather than shutting her down all the way. Aaaargh, this could have been prevented (guilt)...it could be reeeeaaaaaal bad. Suddenly I'm too busy to get to Sant Monica and visit Mac Doc. Suddenly I am  a scared little girl....me, the woman who has travelled to "third world" countries alone and with just my son...I've started and run businesses...led groups...STRONG WOMAN me ...hiding...I need to go to the Mac store. I will call a friend to hold my hand as I take my baby to the Mac doctor/genius'. Pray I can keep all the software I have...and my work that I haven't copied to disc yet...hours, days... weeks of work...see! I'm scared! Writing this makes me laugh..this is nothing in the scheme of things...see how strong actually works...  More important things need to be dealt with as well. Like a big mothering mistake I made recently. Projecting. I am frustrated with myself for not adjusting to the plastic culture of L.A. not outwitting the negatives of the entire film and media industry - yet...I want to give up and go home (New Orleans) where I fit in and am happy...where there is more ease with the grace...I am responsible for Hanz as well though...he is in a good school...his first year at highschool has been his worst grade wise...and here it is: the stupid thing I said that I must correct somehow...correct all the way into his soul (thank you, Archaela, for identifying the elephant with love). I told him he must do better with his grades by end of Nov. or we are moving...well, the truth is I must do better with my career by Nov. or I will consider what is best...Nov. will be a time to evaluate...and as Benson suggested, maybe I just need a day off and a visit home...Eliza- lou, we will have a funky gooooood time!

      I have worked freelance and as an independant contractor for decades. Juggling all sorts of creative and not so creative work...sometimes pimping my skills (doing research, editing, coaching, training, teaching, leading workshops, taking stupid gigs, showgirl stuff, video taping weddings) like all artists who are, as Archeala put it "not happy with the idustry that has grown around our art form". The film industry is evil, not mother friendly at all (what is?)the dance industry requires a vow of poverty, unless you go the showgirl and exotic routes and then it is crazy. I have not ever known what my exact income would be by the end of any month. I'm tired of it. I have rent and utilities covered for july...my savings were spent during my bout with pnuemonia...rent is ridiculous here and I have not owned a home since I sold the one I bought in Mich. I need to own a home again. Now that singulair and advair relieve me of asthma most of the time, I'm going to look for steady income. At least for awhile...I will miss the flexibility of schedule...I am such a pro at turning a small budget into a rich life...I'll decide in Nov. if Hanz and I are moving to New Orleans or staying in Los Angeles...I'm tired and somethings gotta change.

      We were both born the year of the firehorse...we both danced...in addition to that she acts, I direct...we have cast circle together...I was there when she banished a bad man out of her life...through the years she has made some ignorant comments about mothering. I am a mother. She was making generalized statements and has not experienced what she spoke of so I let it go...many times. She has not learned to be selfless or to sacrifice...these things do not make a person better or worse they make a person different. Our lives are different.  Now, at 38, and in a relationship, she tells me she really wants to have a child. She is concerned she may be infertile. She speaks to me about this because I apprenticed with a midwife...odd since what I learned then has to do with what comes after conception...I share the questions I ask women when I think it is crucial to make a choice one way or the other. She dismisses that line of thought. She is really just scared that she is infertile and is completely against adoption. this confuses me...I've heard this before...I still feel confused...that 9 month trip is over in a blink. It is not the most important aspect of the experience, the responsibility. I have loved and cared for children who have not come through me...equally...She is angry at me for suggesting that she might not really want a child to raise. QUESTION for pregnant women: If you knew the father, his family and your family were going to die in an airplane crash before the baby is born...would you still want it? QUESTIONS for those who want to have their first child later in life: have you volunteered to babysit at shelters? held addicted newborns? found a foster mother who could use a day off?..spent 48 hours alone with an active 2 1/2 year old? a weekend with a teen?  Are you sure this is not just a need to be less self-centered? how much of this biological desire is narcissism? are your genes so special?

      I am so happy to have my sense of smell again. A veil has lifted. Access to another form / layer of joy. And it is summer, the best season for scent. Things are in bloom.

      "being called exotic is being called all those worse things in school there is no Real difference because what it all comes under is the value placed on and the creation of Other it is the assumtion of normal and who views themselves as normal is the ones who control the images and have placed category and who think the rest of us are our dance and food and sex and clothes those "exotic" things are devalued and viewed from this distance the keepers of life connection that is who we are with our faces and ancestors i love you what a beautiful knowing face i see you i see home to bad those name callers feel so homeless they must exist only by comparison to what they are not exotic humans thats funny oxoxo" FORK so there! nah...hmmmph

      there is an African saying that goes something like "the trees saw the axe and noticed the handle was one of them" Since the begining of Patriarchal rule, many of the stones thrown at women, (often the first stone) were thrown by women. So I ask women I encounter and I ask myself...did you look at the origin of this?...did you look at this from her perspective?...did you look at this through matriarchal eyes?  I know there is no perfect scenario for a modern woman. I also know what lacks most is value. I don't give a shit about roles...I care that we see the grace in every one -as simple as it sounds...it is.   ...when you lift a stone to throw at my sisters I WILL HOLD MIRROR and ask that you - we - look closer.  Women within the strip industry have been known to say that every form of female beauty has it's appreciator...each woman in there is an individual.    Making a FERTILITY DANCE a TABOO is what has kept it barely alive...She is not a product of your abuse, she is not deserving of it, she did not cause your abuse. She will dance for your village planting and again at your harvest...she will teach your women how to birth...she will bless your creations...celebrations...she will sit in council...she and her children will be fed, clothed and housed...educated... SHE IS IMPORTANT you want to know her because she is you.

      that tall beautiful dancer with the ballett folklorico..at the International Dance Fest/ Competition....when she came out of the bathroom stall and discovered me attempting thier intricate foot steps, waving my imaginary skirt...she held eye contact and a huge perfect smile,  "you are a natural dancer" she called others from her troupe over to watch...helped me learn the step  and in a matter of 3 minutes changed my life for the better....  the belly dancer backstage at a Greek Festival- had been around Greeks enough to know this style of dance was NOT for Greek girls...on the sneak, teaching me most of her routine, the whole time saying " you are a natural dancer...such a gift, such a gift"  she meant it / I felt it  the Traditional Native Dancers lead man- held eye contact saying  I SEE YOU - you are of us- US my heart my drum  Anne Holdrieth saying "you create the space for us...I feel safe with your direction...you're a natural director..."  John Sinclair saying Welcome Welcome  blessed  I have blessed someones path...everyday...no holding back...when I see good-  there is no filter- I see that in you - you are a natural

      If I was to have a band we would put out a cd or an album titled  "Suck my clit !"  and when peopleyell out to us from the audience, saying " you've got BALLS!" we would remind them that we have better than that-  we have "SUPER COOCH!"  I haven't thought of a name for the band yet......

      independant mother I am a natural beaver creating support systems and ways out everywhere...so, connected- independant...not single. If I was single I would have a one bedroom or a room mate who shares the rent. Hanz was raised without paternal childsupport, with extra maternal support - FORK and a spirit brother Sasha for the first 7 years... We did well. Late 80's early 90's in the states,  it was unpopular and even controversial to breast feed,  whole foods was a way, not a chain of stores, no TV was considered negligent...we listened to our inner wisdom, supported eachother and waited for the day....today...when they ask us HOW? and say WOW ...we did not wait for the government to fund the reasearch to tell us what we knew. we knew. We know. Thank GOOODNESS.  we are all benefitting from children who were allowed to be healthy.

      has anyone noticed? is anyone saying something?  before we push it away  coming soon...the wonderful list...meanwhile... say something-  about commercials while waiting for the movie we paid $10 each to see.... 10 years later- after a murder- after 17 years of evidence- of abuse- and a few sweeping lies make it ok? No. OJ, you can't fool everyone that easily. Can you? how many legal careers did that change? Kobe's defense. morning shows with young beautiful blondes sitting next to old, old, icky - look close, old men...morning TV is a strip club with the lights on and more make-up. there are young children who are not protected from TV (like Hanz and Sasha were protected, more about that later) catching clips of Abu Graib. there is a "medication" for children, that lasts ALL DAY if they are "hyper"...long after school lets out. Hanz and I enjoy the morbid humor of the side effects lists for drugs sold AS SEEN ON TV, for the drugs adults choose to take. The lists for the drugs they force on children (cause they were tooo old when they had 'em)...we are not laughing.  "Its about money...If Simpson had been poor he'd be in prison" Johnnie Cochran to any pirate women who take that money- you go! Reagan, OJ, Bush, etc. taught us- get to the media- with a slogan - a news clip phrased catchy like a jingle and you'll win. you'll win. Martha, talk to your masses.

      I have had that "flash within that tells you this is the one" that Joseph Campbell spoke of. More than once....I have been blessed with the   US   experience.  In my most recent loving, the removal of ego that usually comes...allowing an US,  worthy of some sacrifice, for wonderful rewards  -   didn't. I waited, I looked, I pushed and prodded, I wished for what could have been   -   wasn't.   Within the US 's of my past, we enjoyed tremendous growth, great sex- lots of great sex....I miss that....we knew each others birth families and some chosen family/friends...we bathed in the glow of Eros meets Agape (romantic meets universal love)....each US has it's own life span..it's a sweet life. Now,  4 1/2 years since an US -  I enjoy alone. ...I've said before that casual sex is an oxymoron...then I had a fling...technically, it was great. As a physical exercise  - a rite - to separate my physical being from the man I loved, who chose not to be of US...and I have dated...which doesn't really make sense for someoe with a path like mine. I know within an instant if there is anything worth cultivating...then come the standards and the red flags and the fact is:  I would rather be alone than be involved in something less than US.   the standard is that feeling of essential bliss.

      "you like those roles" she said...referring to having the man I was with at the time handle things like the trash, the drill, repairing doors and such...she doesn't seem to get that these are things I am not thrilled to do and would have anyone do them for me...the guy I was sleeping with at that time, was motivated. It's not about specific roles, it is about knowing that the things I do with ease and joy...the nurturing, coaching, directing, making things beautiful and tasty...are extremely VALUABLE to me....as a sensitive, sensual being...I know how awful life is without these things...and KNOW...how valuable it is to have it flow thru naturally... I do these things with a fair amount of disipline and tough love, swift kicks in the arse when needed...and to a girl like the one who spoke those opening words, it must be confusing to expect feminine to mean soft and sweet all the time...

      I want an accurrate warning/rating. I am not entertained by rape scenes, I don't want to see actors having sex- unless it's designated porn. The film Halle Barry recieved an Oscar for contained more than one sex scene I can do without having in my memory...so about the Chloe whats her name film? I'm glad for the negative press...If I want porn, I'll look for the X rating. By avoiding the film they forgot to label porn, I am at least not contributing to more exploitative work for the women who feel a calling to act. Paying to see an art film or major motion picture where the "actors" are engaging in explicit sexual acts, is participating in blurring the line the between what is a film and what is porn.

      "conservatives"- we really need to re-name that group...they tend to be the most wasteful...and when did we allow the word liberal to be a negative? Our rights and freedoms (what is left of them) are the result of Liberals work. Will we ever have objective, fair or anything even close to honest televised "news" in this country again? The change from investigative reporting, to info-tainment, to outright "conservative" propaganda began in the mid '70's...Now our media is owned by how many companies? Who owns them?  It is like what happened to small bookstores and it's dangerous.  It is dangerous to allow newsprograms to re-hash Clintons sex life while Bush committs ATTROCITIES in our name!  The activism I am engaged in is not enough to change this...and still I am not willing to just accept it as the way it has to be...so, NOW WHAT?
