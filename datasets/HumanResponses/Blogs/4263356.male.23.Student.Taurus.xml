      Our class finished up our first week yesterday.  I was done around 2.  I did not studying yesterday as well and it felt great.  Instead I cooked dinner (grilled out) for a few friends.  Mike and Jess went to Grove City, David and Sarah were both in the Air Force training with Mike.  I'm still getting to know everyone but it looks like we have a good group.  Sarah went to Penn State and is quite loyal to that school.  So we hung out at my place for a while and then around 830 Mike, Dave, and I went to a med school frat party.  I didn't even now they had frats at medical schools.  It was a decent party.  I happily drove because Dave and I got up this morning to run 8 miles (yes, we are crazy).  Anyway, there were a lot of 2nd year students at this party.  It wasn't really like a true frat party because basically if you went to PCOM, and even if you didn't, you were allowed to be there.  This other girl Sarah, whom I met during the pub crawl last Friday (good times were had for all) came later in the evening and we talked for a bit.  She is a friend of Andrea's (another grove city grad) and is from Erie, PA.  She seems to be down to earth and in the very least I hope to hang out with her and her friends sometime.  I am not actively pursuing anyone to date but we shall see what happens.  There are a lot of girls at the school with boyfriends/engaged/married and so it is a little difficult seeing what you are getting yourself into.  Priority numero uno is doing well and learning the material.  I studied for about 3 hours today and went over things we learned this week and tomorrow I am going to the gross lab to brush up on a few things and then I'll have to read for Monday's numerous lectures.  So far the material is manageable.  The key is to just stay on top of it.  Simple right?  I think I'm going to cash in early tonight, sleep in a bit and get to church in the morning.  Ok, enough narative...night.

      Fourth day done.  I wasn't quite as tired today as I was yesterday.  I went on a run with the runner's club and that was nice to actually  run with other people and not alone.  I just keep reminding myself that I am indeed still signed up for the Philadelphia half marathon about a month from now.  Yeah, smart move-I know.  Anyway, as promised-some of my feelings right now.  I am finding myself entering into the school mentality, even at this fourth day.  By that I mean school basically envelopes the individual and a new perspective is formed and that is one of constant academia.  It is something I am really going to try and avoid because even though it may foster awesome learning it may annoy those who I still need to keep in contact.  And that would be my friends and family back home.  When I call home and talk with friends and family I really don't want to dwell on everything that is happening in school.  Yes, it is interesting to hear stories about a med school experience but life is actually more than that.  And yes, I believe it will be possible to have a life outside of this med school experience.  As such, I have made some rules for myself.  As much as humanely possible I will not be studying on Friday or Saturday evenings.  Tomorrow I already invited some friends over to my apartment for some grilling and then there is a frat (yes, a med school frat) party over in Manayunk that I believe we will be attending.  That will be my attempt at socializing and getting away from school.  I think that will be a necessary part of decompressing from the intensity of the weekdays.  I've already made it a priority to do some sort of physical exercise-be it running or biking or lifting weights before I even begin studying.  So far I have started studying around 7 each night and can make it to 10:30 or 11 with a few interruptions.  I believe that will be adequate for now and of course things will pick up in two weeks when we have our first exam.  A delicate balance is the name of the game here.  I actually want to have a Philly life.  What motivates me is a chance to avoid what happened to me for the first 2 years at Grove City.  There was a whole lot of learning how to do work and play, and as most of you know I wasn't the most social being for a couple of years there.  But like most things, you learn and move on.  I'm very excited about this new journey, I have already met some different people and enjoy learning their stories.  I suppose that is part of the reason I want to be a doctor.  To be able to hear a person's story and help them in any way possible is a great feeling.  To be in total humility and service to another person is what brings joy to life but unfortunately it seems not enough focus is placed upon that philosophy.  I mean, allow me to bring in to the arguement what I believe the best example of that is; the life of Jesus Christ.  Reading the Gospel accounts of what He did for humanity blows me away.  And He kept things simple, serve others and you will be rewarded, do unto others as you would have them do unto you and you will be rewarded with joy and happiness.  These things seem so self-evident yet most of us continue to look inward and then to material fulfillment to bring about "happiness".  I could probably type for a very long time about humility and what it means to me and how I've seen its power in my life and how I fall short of its fruits all the time but I think I'll save more ramblings for a later date.  My bed is calling out for some lovin and I must oblige in the hastiest way.  Peace.

      Hump day.  I always found it somewhat amusing that Wednesday is called that.  But today it was a bigger than normal hump.  I was  tired .  I actually stayed partially awake this morning in lecture but this afternoon for 2 hours I was in and out of conscienceness and my notes looked like I was having seizures.  But on to the "fun", nerdy part of my day.  Our class spent 3 hours in the gross lab today.  You must understand that our class has about 270 people in it and we all fit into the lab.  It is quite a huge space but still pretty tight when that many people are in it.   Our group was behind from yesterday as far as dissecting simply because the one girl got sick and I wanted to make sure she was O.K. and also because we were being very careful (slow) when reflecting and cleaning all the goodies we were supposed to look at.  So today we rock and rolled our way back to being on schedule.  I performed my first and probably last laminectomy on poor Ruby.  I don't think she enjoyed it as much as I did.  I believe I did have a weird grin on my face as I took a bone saw to the spinal column.  As one guy in my class put it, he felt like scorpian from Mortal Kombat.  Oh how I miss those childhood memories of playing that game ad infinitum.  I didn't get nearly enough studying done tonight mainly because I fielded a few phone calls and my friend Mike came over to study.  And when I say study I do mean watch the Olympics with it on mute.  And when I say on mute I mean that it really doesn't matter if there is sound or not, our eyes were not in our books.  Oh well, it's only the third day :-)  I'm exhausted and looking for a good nights rest.  I'll share more feelings some other time, today just took a lot out of me and tomorrow is going to be equally trying.  You can see why I live by the philosophy of only taking one day at a time as it comes to you.  Otherwise I think my mind would blow.  God Bless.

      Yeah, that's right, I'm blogging.  I saw that my friend Seth (from Grove City College) had a link to the blog site and well here I sit typing away.  We'll see how this goes for a while.  Who knows, maybe it will be good for me?  I arrived in Philly August 8, 2004.  After a wonderful day of moving in and being completely exhausted and slightly sick from eating something which did not agree with me that weekend I was officially in the city.  Last week was orientation.  Last week was fun.  Last week went way too fast.  I really like my class because there is such a variety of people represented.  Black, white, asian, indian, christian, jew, islamic, atheist...you name it I am sure someone of your description goes here.  And another interesting thing is that a lot of people are either engaged or married trying the whole med school thing.  I'm really glad my social attachments do not involve anything remotely romantic right now.   Anywho, I'm writing this at the end of my 2nd day as a MSI (med student).  And how do I feel?  Rather relaxed to be honest.  The key is keeping up with the material each day.  That requires about 3 to 4 hours of study once you get home from classes which normally run 8-4/5 each day.  A typical day for me involves lectures beginning at 8 and normally going through 11 or 12.  At that point, at least in this trimester, we all heard up to the anatomy lab and dissect our cadavers for 2 to 3 hours at a time.  Being only the second day, I am still getting used to gross.  Our lady, Ruby, is a large black lady who graciously donated her body for the sake of society hopefully receiving compentent doctors in 4 years.  There is nothing more surreal than looking at the shell of a person, and then violating that shell in order to learn all you can about whatever section of the body you are on (right now it's the dorsum).  I really don't want to make this an extremely long entry because I will write again and touch on other things...but real quick; found a great church about 20 minutes away on Sunday, very young, very contemporary, nondenominational.  I'll probably check it out again this Sunday.  God got me to this point in my life and I know He will carry me through this stage as well.  Ok, bed time-I'm trying to be ambitious and will be getting up before lecture tomorrow for a bike ride...God Bless.
