      So the other day me and my friends went downtown chi town to go to a party. We hung out at the party for a little, then we decided to go get some food at the Weiner Circle. (Named one of the top 10 hot dog stands in the US by the food network.) So we get directions to go down there. Not more then 3 blocks down we find our selves in the heart of the projects. Oh sh*t. There ghetto people everywhere with du rags and shit every where. They were all giving us dirty look and flashing gang symbols at us. We were in a jeep with no doors or a top or anything. It was pretty freeky. These projects went on for about 4 blocks then all of a sudden there's a car stopped in the middle of the road and we couldnt get through. So we were stopped there sitting there. Everyone was like yelling fuckin white boys and shit and were all just like lookin forward. Lucky the stopped car was a cop car searchin some guy for somthin, and the cop told us to get out of there. We dodged a bullet one that one. Litterally. So we got out of there and we realize were totally lost on the west side of Chicago. eventually after about an hour of driving we get to the Weiner Circle. Yes!! And let me tell you, it was awesome. I get in there and order my food and when im done paying the lady bangs the tip can and says leave a tip dont be scared. But this is like a fast food joint where you dont really leave tips so I just put my spare cahnge in there. And walk away. Then I hear get over hear you cheap mother F*cker and leave some dollar bills. So I went back and left some more money. My friend goes up to order and he orders a chili cheese dog. The lady says to him. We ain't got no chili but I can give you some chili outta my ass. HAHA. Well that place is known for that kinda stuff and they do it as a joke to get tips. The food was great. So we all get in the car and try to start finding our way home. But nce again we get completly lost. My friend sees a cop car behind us and he says "haha theres someone in the back of the car. So we all start lookin back and back agian to see the person in the back. Next thing we know, the cops lights are on and we get pulled over. Oh Sh*t. He comes up and says" What are you guys all lookin at me all scared like?" And my friend who was driving said "We're lost and we were hoping you could tell us where to go." So the cop winds up leading us to the highway. Don't worry this long story is almost over. So we finally find the high way and we are on the way home. Then all of a sudden this pimped out croch-rocket motor cycle goin like 80 pulls up right next to us like 2 feet away from me. I could have reached out and touched him. He looks over at us, nods and then slowing drifts back. Two seconds later we hear his engine get really loud I look over and there he is doing a wheelie at 90 miles an hour and a couple second later like 20 other motor cycles come over and they just take over the street. It was a f*ckin crazy night.

      Well the 4th was pretty boring... started off the day with the boring parade... then went over to Jon's for alittle to chill. Then later we went to his girlfriends BBQ. The food was good and the girls were pretty. Then we went out to the fireworks. Pretty much everyone was drunk... I don't really dirnk and I especailly didn't drink cause I didnt want to crash the Porsche. After the fireworks most of my friends went home cause they were bored. But I went over to the playground cause i saw some people I knew. We wound up climing over the fence and skinny dipping in the pool with some girls. It was a ton of fun and we were out untill like 6 in the mornin. Then I came home and went to bed. It felt really good to sleep. So pretty much the 4th wasnt to great, but when the clock hit midnight the partay started and it was a lot of fun.            -Dogg
