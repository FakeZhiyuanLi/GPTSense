       I'm thoroughly enjoying the comments from my posting.  (You don't have to be related to me to post them!)  My sister Marcy is a linguist, and my brother Rick has studied Czech, so they have some interesting things to say about the Czech language.  I learned that a fun, very basic way to acquaint yourself with a language is to drive on its country's roads and play the Alphabet Game.  (This was actually my 9-year-old's idea, and not because of the educational value.)  I thought it was funny how instantaneously we found the letters "K" and "Z."  The two letters that were nearly impossible were "Q" and "W."  Steve and I finally found "Q" simultaneously--me on an Antiques store, and him on the ubiquitous ad for "Urquell" beer.  Both are foreign words.  As for "W," I found that in a name on a German truck just as I was about to give up.

       There we were, in Germany in the summertime, two parents, a teenager, and an almost-10-year-old, with two weeks off work, but low on money.  We were being lazy--reading, watching videos.  I was working madly on writing the second draft of my YA novel and making great headway.  Yet it seemed a crime to not make the most of the opportunity and take a trip somewhere.  So we decided to head for the Czech Republic, where the dollar isn't so weak as in other parts of Europe.  On a whim, I bought a copy of National Geographic Traveler's guidebook on Prague and the Czech Republic.  I'd already seen that hotel rooms in Prague are pretty expensive, but a place in Melnik, listed as a "Day Trip" from Prague, caught my eye.  The listing sounded nice--right next to the castle, with kitchenettes and comfortable accommodations.  It said "Some of the rooms have four beds, making the hotel a useful option for families."  We decided to try it.  It was listed as from $50 to $80 for a double room, so we were disappointed when we calculated the price in dollars and it was $150 a night, but at least we could all be in one room.  We booked three nights.  Incidentally, I so wish that someone would publish a European hotel guide for families!  The guidebooks always list the price for a double room, but we've found that that has little correlation to how much a hotel is going to cost us.  If the hotel doesn't even have rooms that fit four, we usually have to pay twice the price.  If they do have rooms, it depends on whether or not they give a discount for children.  How nice it would be if prices were listed for families of 3, 4, 5, or 6 members!  (Though we'd settle for the price for a family of four.)  We left at 10:30 in the morning.  It was a cloudy day, and the temperatures were perfect for driving.  The green hills, fields and forests didn't change much as we passed from Germany into the Czech Republic.  The main difference was that now the signs appeared as gibberish.  (What kind of language has one-letter words that are consonants?  I saw the word "k" here and there.)  There also was more advertising across the overpasses than in Germany.  The Czechs seem to have embraced the capitalist spirit.  The highway was smooth and straight and well-maintained.  At 5:00, we were just coming into the city.  Timothy was hungry.  Steve asked we should stop and eat, but I wanted to press on to Melnik (on the other side of Prague).  What a mistake!  I hadn't been thinking about rush hour.  We crawled forward.  What had looked like a simple ring road around the city ended up being a complicated series of turns and exits.  My map showed that several different route numbers were involved in the ring around the city, but it didn't tell which route joined where, and we took a detour south for a bit.  Well, we finally made it to Melnik and found our hotel, "U Rytiru."  It's a rather old building, but had nice furnishings downstairs.  There was no elevator, so we hauled our bags up two flights of stairs, hoping we weren't paying all that money for some dive.  We opened the door and all said, "Wow!"  It wasn't a room; it was a suite.  The door opened into a huge living/dining room with a balcony and window with a grand view.  The "kitchenette" was about twice the size of our kitchen at home, and more modern.  (Though it didn't have any dishes or utensils, and we never asked if we could borrow some.)  There were three bedrooms, all big and with nice chests of drawers and desks.  There wasn't one simple bathroom.  There was a shower room, a room with a toilet and sink, and another big bathroom with a toilet and bidet, a double sink, and a jacuzzi!  Needless to say, we suddenly felt much better about spending three nights in this place.  The price wasn't high at all for what we were getting.  After settling in, we roamed around the town a bit.  There was a palace and a church next to the hotel, both high on a ridge overlooking the Vlatava River, with grapevines growing on the side of the ridge.  It was a lovely evening, still cloudy but at a perfect temperature, not too cold and not too hot.  Melnik reminded me strongly of Pordenone, in Italy.  Both towns had galleries in front of shops with Romanesque arches.  The Czech shops were a little shabbier, with some peeling paint, but the idea was similar, a nice place for strolling.  The next day we slept late, then drove into Prague.  It only took about a half-hour, though then a bit longer for me to navigate the one-way streets and get us close to the Castle.  Prague reminds me a little bit of Edinburgh, with a big castle complex on a hill overlooking the city.  Only Edinburgh's castle and hill are more rough and rugged.  The dominating feature of Prague's castle is St. Vitus's Cathedral in the center of it.  We were there just in time for the Changing of the Guard at 12:00.  Rather than push our way through the crowds, we went into the National Gallery next to the castle, located in Sternberg Palace (and so is our 158th Castle).  We only saw one wing, with lots of masterpieces by Dutch painters, and also a beautiful painting of Christ by El Greco.  We had lunch at the museum.  In the castle, we wandered through the cathedral, the old palace, and the lanes of shops.  I bought a couple of books by Kafka--It seemed the right thing to do in Prague.  We visited the Toy Museum, which was having a special exhibit of Barbie through the years.  I spotted a couple of Barbies my sister used to have.  Remember Walking Jamie, Becky?  She was there.  Most of the costumes I recognized were from the early 70s.  You know, pinks and oranges.  On Saturday, we visited the part of Prague on the other side of the river.  We started with the Charles Bridge.  It reminded me of the Rialto Bridge in Venice--crowds of people, and lots of things to buy.  Saturday, the weather had turned to glorious sunshine.  It felt good to be over the river in a great city, with bright sunshine and cool breezes.  We went across the Charles Bridge, with me madly snapping pictures.  So many towers and spires in Prague!  We ate lunch in a nice cool and peaceful Italian place, away from the crowds, before going back to the other side.  Then we made our way slowly to the Old Town Square, stopping in lots of shops along the way.  A marathon was going on in the Old Town Square, so we couldn't examine too many buildings too closely.  But I still managed to take lots of pictures, and we even found an English-language bookstore in which to go nuts.  After that, we walked on, heading for Wenceslas Square and the National Museum, which Timothy wanted to see.  We had passed its imposing building the day before, and he liked the sound of it in the guidebook.  We ended up taking too long to get there before it opened, distracted when we saw the headquarters of the Cowparade.  Did I forget to mention the Cowparade?  Cowparade 2004 was my almost-10-year-old son Timothy's favorite thing about Prague.  All over the city, there were cow statues in three different poses, all decorated in different ways.  Timothy's favorite was the Matrix cow, with letters and numbers going down its sides.  I liked some of the pretty designs, but I also liked the cow that was reading a book.  Timothy also enjoyed the cow that was surfing the Internet.  I took pictures of all of them, planning to make a Cowlage when I'm done.  At the Cowparade office, we got a map of the Cow-ordinates of more cows and Timothy got a Cowparade T-shirt.  Josh also got one that said, "Make Cows, Not War."  I was amazed that, no matter how long we walked, the buildings continued to be grand and palatial.  I loved the carvings and statues on the fronts of the buildings.  No matter where we were, we couldn't forget that we were in a grand old European city.  Our final day was Sunday.  We stopped at the National Museum on our way home.  It was nothing special, but a nice excuse to go into Prague again.  I liked the collection of Rocks and Minerals.  Or at least the first 500 or so were interesting.  We decided to drive on another hour to Plzen for lunch.  Steve (my husband) has been there twice on trips with the band.  He took us to a nice restaurant where their sponsors had fed them while they were there.  The food was wonderful, and the prices were low.  Plzen is another lovely little town on a river.  It has a beautiful cathedral in a grand town square.  It was a Sunday, so none of the shops were open, and it was slightly shabby, like Melnik, but seemed a beautiful place.  Now we're back home in Germany, enjoying our cool summer weather.  And I've got about 300 more pictures to develop.  (I'll try to figure out how to post some on this site.)

       When I was back in California at Christmastime, a relative asked me what I liked about living in Germany.  I was so surprised by the question--I thought I had more than answered that over the years--that I hardly knew what to say.  As I'm starting this blog, I thought it might be nice to begin by talking about why I love living here.  I'm also going to try to keep my postings shorter, more readable in a small amount of time, so I may only begin on that topic.  We moved to Germany at the end of 1996.  My husband, Steve, is in the U. S. Air Force Band, and he got transferred as a volunteer to be part of the U. S. Air Forces in Europe Band.  About a year before, I had read an article in "Postive Living" magazine that suggested writing down your dreams.  On a whim, I wrote down several.  These weren't goals.  They weren't things I thought were likely to come true any time soon.  They were simply neat things that I would love to have happen.  When we moved to Germany, 9 of them came true all at once.  How could I not be happy?  The biggest dream was that I got to quit teaching Math.  I have a Master's degree in Math, and since I got that, I had been teaching at the college level.  First, I taught full-time at Biola University in California, where I also did my undergraduate work.  When Steve joined the Air Force, I began teaching part-time at night for Burlington County College in New Jersey.  We moved to Illinois in 1991, and within a week I had a job teaching part-time at night for Belleville Area College.  I learned to enjoy teaching somewhat, but it was never something that came naturally to me.  I love doing math, but teaching people who don't like it simply isn't as much fun.  I'm an introvert, and I don't like facing a classroom full of people I don't know.  (After the first night of a class, it only gets better.)  I don't like having to prepare lectures--You can't possibly prepare enough to make sure you'll "perform" perfectly.  My favorite part was probably sitting at home grading papers, though that's a drag when they don't do well.  When is it the teacher's fault and when is it the student's fault?  I wanted my students to do well, but you can't make them study.  Anyway, with moving to Germany came something wonderful called COLA--"Cost of Living Allowance."  They pay servicemembers in Europe that to make up for the expenses they have in another currency and the extra cost to living overseas.  When we moved it was about $150 per month.  Now it's more than $750 per month!  (It goes up when the dollar goes down; it's tied to the exchange rate.)  (We're going to miss it horribly when we go back to America.)  That was just the little bit we needed to enable us to squeak by without me working.  There are American colleges here, so I could have found a job teaching, but Steve would be traveling more than ever and I didn't want to have to find babysitting, and I wanted to be home with my then-two-year-old son and maybe, finally, make some progress on my dream of becoming a writer.  (I found that teaching math isn't a good side job for trying to be a writer.  When I had extra time at home, I spent it preparing lectures and grading papers, which didn't leave much time for writing.  Better is a job you can leave at work.)  So, the first dream that Germany fulfilled was the chance, for a year and a half, to be an at-home Mom.  Timothy and I thoroughly enjoyed that time!
