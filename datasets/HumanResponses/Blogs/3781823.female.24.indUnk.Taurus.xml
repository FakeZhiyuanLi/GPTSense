      Sometime back in March I guess, I made my first ever trip to a yarn store -  urlLink The Woolie Ewe.   I was so overwhelmed by all the beautiful yarns that I didn't know what to do. But I really wanted to buy something, so I bought two balls of this yarn from the Plymouth Italian Collection. It's called Siam. Go  urlLink here   and click on Siam to see what it looks like. The yarn was on sale for 50% off, and it had such pretty colors and fluffy bits sticking out that I couldn't resist.  I wasn't sure if I had enough to make a scarf out of it, but I took a chance and paired it with one strand of Caron Simply Soft in black and a size N hook. It's made in single crochet with chain 1 spaces. Luckily, I did have enough to make the scarf with fringe. It ended up being 3" wide and 60" long with fringe. It's really thick also.   I don't know think anyone on my Christmas list would like this scarf, so I'm going to keep it!

      Let's see if I can figure this blogger stuff out.   I crocheted another scarf today, but this one is definitely for me. I made a list of all the people I need to crochet Christmas presents for. The list contains 10 people. I've made one of the presents. Luckily, I know what I want to make for everyone, and I have most of the yarn I need.

      I finished the baby blanket I'm making for my friends Heather and Chris. It's the first baby blanket I've made. The baby isn't due until October, so I got it done in plenty of time.  I will post pictures of the blanket as soon as I figure out what's wrong with the digital camera.   I ordered a bunch of yarn last night. Some of it is to make Christmas presents, and some of it is to make this scarf for myself that I am completely in love with from the Vogue Knitting Crocheted Scarves book.

      I finished the granny square scarf on Saturday night, or actually Sunday morning at 5:30 am while I was watching the Olympics    This zig-zag scarf is for my mom. This pattern was very very quick to make.    Okay, this has nothing to do with crochet, but there is something very hot about men's synchronized diving.

        These are all going to be edged in black and then sewn together to make a scarf.    Finally, a place to keep all my crochet accessories.  I used  urlLink this pattern.

      I'm in some kind of crocheting slump. Every time I start a pattern I end up stopping and ripping it out because I'm either disatisfied with the way the pattern looks or with the way the yarn looks in the pattern. I think I want to make my grandma a shawl for Christmas, but I've looked at every shawl pattern on the internet and in my books and none of them are appealing to me. Sigh.   Maybe I should just use my cotton yarn to make her a potholder or a dishcloth . . .   The only thing I have been succesful making are some little granny squares. I think I'm going to edge them in black and put them end to end to make a scarf for someone.   Christmas Update:  6 down, 5 to go (if I can ever settle on patterns/stitches for them)

      I've been trying to update this blog for awhile, but I couldn't actually type in the text box! I don't think Camino likes Blogger.  Anyway, here are the long awaited pictures.    My first attempt at intarsia. I want to make my future sister-in-law a scarf with an airplane on it because she is going to be a pilot. But this is too wide to be a scarf.    I finally made some hats. The orange one is for the fiance. Orange is his favorite color. I hate orange . .      This is for my little sister.    The color is off in this picture. The blue is really sage green.    Here's the baby blanket I made for Heather and Chris. They came over last week, and I gave it to them. They seemed to really like it.
