      ~~~August 4, 2004~~~  Getting so exciting about going on a vacation with my family, my sisters' family and my parents for family reunion. I got up at 6:30am to finish one last dirty load then start packing. Mathew and his daddy was still asleep! I was thinking.... Man, I wish I could sleep longer! But I had so much to do to get ready to go on road. We finally left at 10am which I was hoping for 9am. Then we find out that the truck tire was very low. UUgghhh!!! Plans don't always work the way u want. So, we had to go to walmart to have the tire patch up the hole and said it'll only take 20 minutes. So we decided to eat at McDonald which is inside of the Walmart. Then we went back to where the truck was. Find out they havent start fix our truck.. GGRRR.. Finally they started working on our truck. They told us that they can't patch the hole since the tire was worn out! So unbelievable!! Cost money to buy a new tire! I wasn't very happy and Mathew was starting to be very restless and cranky.. Finally, we left 2 hours later.. We had to drive to Scott City for 3 1/2 hrs. While I was driving Mathew and his daddy passed out! Jeez! Don't I get any sleep?!? In about half way to Scott City, I couldn't keep driving since I was getting sleeping. So, I woke Mauricio up so he can drive the rest. Finally we arrived to Scott City. It was so good to see my parents. Mathew was happy to see his grandma! But not sure about grandpa. It took him a while to let him grandpa hold him. My oldest sis, Nikole and her family haven't leave Salina yet. We were planning to hit on the road to Colorado Spgs, CO at 5pm. (The famous thing about the Gruver family is that we are never is on time!) NIkole and her family came and then we all were ready to hit on the road. My middle sis, Heather, and her family already left before us. Heather doesn't like to be late and must be stick to plans. Grandma and I were looking at baby names in the book. Mathew and daddy was sleeping. Grandpa was driving. It was raining and lightning. All of sudden, I woke up and freaked out! There was flood on the road and we couldn't see the road. I screamed "OH MY GOD!" It really scared the shit out of me. Grandpa managed it thru! *sigh* My heartbeat was beating so hard! Grandma was like calm down and its ok. PPHHTT at her! Finally we got to Colorado Spgs and up the mountain. Grandpa got lost several times up the mountain. We couldn't find the motel. I keep freaked out how fast Grandpa was driving thru the mountain since it was soo curvy road. *sigh* I was pretty grouchy since it was pretty late. We finally found the motel around 1am! Then we all went to bed. AMEN! More to come--August 5th, 2004
