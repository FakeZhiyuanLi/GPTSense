      Howdy America.  I'm back by popular demand.  Yee-Ha.     Don't piss on my face and tell me it's raining.   Since my last article, a lot has happend in the world.   Seriously. Things have occurred.  Actions, and in some cases...get this..."Reactions". I know so, because I watch the News, and it blows my friggin mind.  I watch the News, and I think, "This is amazing, something happens in the world, and my trusted News friends let me know!"  Thank you News!  This is for you!   Thanks to the News , I know right away if somebody has died, and whether it was gang-related, or just a garden variety killing-spree.    Thanks to the News , I always know where I stand with Terror, too.  Like a few weeks ago, when the Terror Alert Level was lowered from "Orange" to "Yellow".  Boy was I releaved, and I felt much less terror.    Thanks to the News , I always know the score of the game.  Last week thursday, I missed the late News, it was a freak occurrence, so I didn't know the score on Friday Morining.  I felt empty inside all day.  Some other guys knew it, but they wouldn't tell me.  Thanks to the News , I always know what's new and sexy in Hollywood.  Like last week, when I found out that Laura Flynn Boyle has lost ten pounds from not eating, and Ethan Hawke is considering growing a goatee.  Wow. Finally,  Thanks to the News  I always know the temperature and barometric pressure, and I am privy to the zany and witty anecdotes of Tad the weatherman (he's only right half the time, but he has good hair).  The other night after watching the News, I was having my bedtime snack Of Grape Shasta Cola and Funnions, and I had a thought:  What about those people who can't understand the News? You see I went to college, so I can comprehend this high-level information serivce.  I'm one of the lucky ones. Unfortunately, people who didn't go to college can't read, so I figure they might be having probems with the heavy vocabulary.  Poor saps.  They must be really confused and scared.  I see them everyday, walking around with a fake smiles on their faces, and only I know the real truth; these people are petrified.  I can't imagine a world without the News.  It would be chaos.  Terrorist groups could be plotting right now, and I wouldn't know about it!  Even more firghtening, I could walk outside expecting sushine and it could be raining! Raining, people, raining!  How would I survive?  I'm suficating!  As a matter of fact, I could be missing something right now!  Why am I writting this?!  I am wasting valuable time!  Martha Stewart could be appealing the verdict!  El Nino could be making a comeback!  Saddam could have escaped!  Julia Roberts might be eating at a new restaurant!  Gay men could be getting married!  Straight men could be getting divorced! IT COULD BE BLACK HISTORY MONTH RIGHT NOW AND I WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW IT!!!!!  THE VOICES ARE STARTING AGAIN, AND THEY WON'T STOP!!!! PLEASE, SOMEBODY GET ME STONE PHILLIPS WITH A SIDE OF SHEPARD SMITH BEFORE I LOSE MY MIND!!!!!!  See you next week, please tip you waiters.

       Pop quiz hot shot:  Who's smarter, Arnold Shwarneneger or George W. Bush? If you guessed "Avocado"...you're right!!   But seriously folks, do you think the four hours of TV you watch a day, and six hours on the weekends is actually improving your life?  Well, if you are considering that question, the answer is no.  If just the mention of the letters "T" and "V" has led to a paralyzed-like-state in which all you can think about is Kelso from "That 70's Show", then I may be too late. Rather than preaching, I will just recommend the following:  When you go home, don't turn on the television. Change clothes, put on some music, make some dinner, read a book, and then try having a conversation with a friend or loved one...or for you assholes out there...try the homeless guy around the corner.  Give it a shot.  Or, continue to subject yourself to the following:   There is a new commercial on television that gives me that urge to shove a sharp object in my eye.   No, it's not the "Are you Gellin?" Dr. Shol's commercial (thought that has led to a record 8 suicides in Utah and Delaware over the last six months), but the one with the animated oranges on treadmills, and in a juice-filled swimming pool.  In this piece of raccoon-shit advetisement, Jamie Lee Curtis says that, thanks to those fine people at Tropicana,there's a new Orange Juice out there that's, get this, "healthy". Say that sentence out loud, and let it sink in.   Dont' worry I'll wait.  Take your time.  I don't know about you, but I'm pissed off.  My hackels are up, fuckers. Somebody's ass is grass. This isn't like a few years back when some quack-fuck doctor said you could eat a jumbo bag of Doritos and not gain weight...because all of that weight just dripped out your ass.  This is entirely different.  Orange Juice has always been an essential part of any balanced breakfast, am I right or am I right?  Now we are to believe that it has all been a lie?  No way.  I don't buy it. This is a ploy my friends...and you wanna know who is behind it?  Yeah?  Do ya?  Yeah?  Well so do I!  And since I don't know, I'm just gonna specualte!   It's those g-d damn terrorists.  I'll bet that over the last few years while Osama has been held up in some cave some where, sweating his balls off, he's been scheming and plotting about how he can destroy the american infidels once and for all.  So what did he do?  What did he come up with?  He went straight into the heart of Americana, and poisoned O.J. Can't you feel it, America?  He's preying on our consumer weakness to keep a healthy refridgerator!  He's playing with our minds and bodies like a toddler with ADHD!  He's throwing us around like the four-square-ball at recess!  It's insanity.   But let's be logical, friends.  Let's reason this out. Maybe these are all clues that we could send to Tom Ridge at Homeland Security?  Maybe these are hints to the real identity of Bin Laden?  For all we know, Osama could be Dr. Atkins.  Think about it....have you ever heard Atkin's first name?  No, you haven't!  It's a friggin pseudonym, a nom de plume, an alias, an a.k.a...a pseudonym!!   I'm convinced, that's it, I'm convinced!   This is all a joint venture between two front companies; Atkins and Tropicana to destroy the American spirit with "health food"!    Any you know what else is really spooky?..."Tropicana" is an acronym for "S-C-R-E-W-A-M-E-R-I-C-A".  Crazy.    If I was you, I'd kick the orange stuff.  I'm moving on to grape juice.   Hey buddy, it's your life.  Sincerely yours,  Sol Lieberman

       Dr. God   Okay, before I delve into this topic, I will provide a brief preface for all you close-minded morons out there, and rather than patronizing you with a definition of the word "opinion", I will simply state the following: "If you don't appreciate what I say, click the little 'x' up there, and go watch re-runs of Seventh Heaven...you twit.  At the same time, if you do infact like what I say, please refrain from regurgitating these thoughts of mine to your cronies like they are authentically yours.  That's stupid.  And then you are stupid.  Stupid.  And away we go...  Finding the right plumber can be a difficult undertaking.  I imagine finding a good Undertaker is complicated as well.  But thankfully, those of us that own or rent property are provided with the means to meet these ends.  As for those of you on the street: It sucks to be you.  Yes friends, I am talking about the  Phone Book .  Whether white or yellow, this tome brimms with half-page ads to gain our trust, and brilliantly worded passages to draw out our consumer instinct.  Have you ever been physically attracted to the Jiffy Lube logo?  My point exactly.  The Phone Book has in many ways defined what it is to be an American.  Want a donut?  I know I do.  Just pick up that trusy book and make the call.  Maybe you want a massage?  Just find that M-tab and you're on you way, friend.  Are you hearing voices? The answer lies under "P" with Dr. Greenstein.  Ahhh, the pleasures of freedom.  But, unfortuanatley, there is trouble in paradise...  It all started with the "numbers of deception":  411.  They call this "information", but for those of us in-the-know, this number represents all that is evil in the world today.  It started at 25 cents, with a free connection.  Now we're talking an even buck, and that woman on the other line has become even more threatening:  "For an additional 35 cents, I will connect you to...".  Scary, isn't it.  Luckily, the facists behind 411 let their greed get the better of them, and the Phone Book survived.  But that was just the begining. Now, the real enemy has emerged.  Thanks to the meniacal and wicked Genius of people like Al Gore, our country is now overrun by the "Information Super-Highway".  Our sacred Phone Book, crafted with tender-loving care, is now battling the dreaded "http://www".  And, though it pains me to say it, the book is losing the battle. The great Phone Book is on life support, friends.  Just look out in your hallway, or on your stoop, and you will surely see our old friend Phone Book sufficating under plastic wrap. And unlike so many others,  I've got the sand to say what is really going on here :  Al Gore has put a contract out on the Phone Book.  The Phone Book is getting whacked-out, friends, and when the great book is gone, a hush will fall across this land of ours, and we will be lost, forever.      So what do we do?  To find the answers, I went to the Founding Fathers of the Phone Book; Chiropractors.  The following conversation was taped on October 12, 2003  So, Doctors Miller and Johnson, how's business?  Miller:  Couldn't be better.  Johnson:  Dido.  Me:  Wait a minute, I thought you were struggling due to the plight of the Phone Book?  Miller:  Nah, we chiropractors adjust to the world around us, we are capitalists through and through.  Johnson:  I concur.  Me:  Let me get this straight, you don't need the great book to survive?  Miller:  No.  It's the message that counts.  Whether internet or paperback, it makes no difference to me.  People will always need adjustments, and once they come, unless they fall in-line with our detractors, they always come back.  We don't even care if they even read the book.  It's just for show, it brings them in the doors.  Johnson:  Couldn't have said it better myself.  Me:  But what about the other businesses out there that are failing because of the struggling Phone Book?  Miller:  Apparently, they lack the inherent virtue of our noble profession. We are about truth.  Johnson:  Good stuff, Miller.  You do me proud.    Me.  Well, this is all quite unexpected.  I'm stunned.  Thanks for your time Doctors.  Miller:  Will I be seeing you on Sunday Morning?  Me: Yes Doctor Miller.  Miller:  Good.  Now go out into the world my son.   Well maybe I have some thinking to do.  I thought the Phone Book was and is the key to true enlightment, but it seems that the message will continue no matter how it is transfered.  It also seems like the real wisdom behind the book is found on the adjustment table?  Maybe so, and maybe I just need some more information, but I will tell you this, I will not rest untill I find the answers.   -Sol Lieberman

      There is a new "Male Supplement" out there giving Viagra some   stiff   competition.  Yes, I wrote "stiff", and yes, that is the worst pun of all time.  Blow me.  This new   stroke   of medical genius is none other than Cialis, and as it shows in the commercial, it's perfect to use when lounging with your lover in matching bathtubs full of steamy water, in the middle of the Florida Everglades.  If you read the script on the bottom of the screen(which is called "We don't want you to know this, so we write it small and only show it for a second" script), you will see the following side-effects, and precautionary warnings:  1. Do not use errection as a weapon, unless to fight off attacking alligators in the Florida Everglades. 2. If errection changes color, please dip dick in apple juice to prevent explosion. 3. Errection may remain post-sexual-intercourse, and if this occurs, either request Blow-Job, or use errection as a carpentry-tool. 4. Ejection-velocty of sperm can reach up to 255mph. We don't know if this is good or bad. 5. After taking Cialis, refrain from consuming either Sunny Delight or Nutra-Grain Bars. 6. Also, refrain from listening to Clay Aiken while on Cialis. 7. If erection does not occur within 30 minutes of ingestion, touch your partners boobs. 8. Rafael Palmero is a communist dog and not to be trusted. 9. If errection lasts longer than 3 days, duct-tape dick to leg and watch old footage of either Janet Reno or Sandra Bernhardt. (Listening to Clay Aiken is recommended, too) 10. Special Thanks to the inmates of Riker's Island and 17 Hookers who requested to remain nameles, whom assisted us with the testing of this product, leading to a 99% success rate.  In closing, I will note that I used my errection to type this piece. I haven't left my apartment for days. Send food and/or snapshots of Elanor Roosevelt.  AN' M' Out  -Sol Lieberman

       Hello.   My name is Richie Meyer.  I am a "dweeb".  I am a "nerd".  I am a "pansy".  I am a "wimp, loser, dork, idiot, hoser, lame-o,waste-of-space", and I am also a "four-eyed, fat-assed,  carrot-topped, goody-two-shoed, mama's boy".  Apparently, “I will never kiss a girl, because I suck.".  Also, I "will never get picked to play basketball, football, baseball, or soccer, becuase I suck". Additionally, I better keep my mouth shut, or I will find myself "stuffed in a locker like beef in a burrito...and I suck.".   To say the least, I am finding the social aspects of the 8th graderather...challenging.  And it's all because of Steve Zepner, or "Big Z" as he calls himself.  Just last week, "Big Z" pulled my pants down in the cafeteria. Steve shouted, "Looks like a toddler".  Everyone had a good laugh.  That was really fun.  At times, I wonder how it would feel to punch him repeatedly in the face, for ohh, let's say, 7 to 10 hours. My hand would get sore, but then I could switch to a nine-iron or a billy-club.    Here's another good one:  Three months ago, we were in Ms. Bonaquisti's math class, and Big Z didn't do too hot on his test, I whispered, "looks more like 'Big F'."  Luckliy, Steve heard that.  So after school, he relieved himself on some snow and happily made me eat it.  What an experience.     But yesterday, Big Z really out-did himself.  You see, there is this Girl Suzie Derkins, and like me, she isn't the most popluar kid, victimized by ridicule and truly underappreciated for her smarts and charm.  I like her. I like her a lot.  So I am talking to her in the hallway, getting up the nerve to ask her to the spring dance, and I feel an arm come around my shoulder. "Well I owe you ten bucks man, you were right, she is the ugliest girl in school!" Said Big Z. Suzie Derkins started crying and ran away.  Then Big Z took my pants down again.  What a kidder.  Good Times.   I went home yesterday, I called Suzie Derkins and apologized, and Swore I'd make it up to her.  Big Z was going down.    April the 10th, 2004     7:50am--  First Period.   I give my daily announcement over the school loudspeakers...."The girls volleyball team has made the sectional tournament, so let's give them our support, the Science Club will meet in Mr. Lanin's room, and Steve Zepner, a.k.a Big Z, is inviting all you guys over after school for cookies that he baked with his mommy last night."    9:20am-  First passing time.   Steve is hunting me in the hallways.  He doesn't find me, because I am breaking into his locker, and spraying down his gym clothes with cat piss.    9:35am--  Second Period.   Steve is summoned to the office for an urgent phone call: "Hello?", "Hi Steve, it's Richie Meyer, just wanted to let you know that your mom is banging the principal, and your dad wants a sex change.  Oh! by the way, when you are working at the corner gas station in twenty years, I am going to buy it just so I can fire your dumb ass.  Ta ta."   9:27am-- Back to class.  Steve returns to class to find his bag missing, and replaced by a pink "Hello Kitty" bag, filled with Britney Spears notebooks, rainbow stickers, unicorn folders, etc.      9:28am--  Steve is mad.    10:55am--  Second Passing Time.   Steve organizes his underlings for a group hunt.  They see me in the nurses office complaining of a stomach problem.  I moon them when Nurse McClintock turns away.    11:10am-- Third Period.   I eat five raw eggs, three pickels and drink a 1/2 gallon of milk & beet juice in the bathroom.  I get to class late, with a note from the nurse, I walk by Steve in the aisle, he is threatening me.  I throw up on him. I am sent home for the day.  Steve is sent to his gym locker for a change of clothes.  Good times.    3:50pm--  Steve rings my doorbell, his lackies in tow.  Suzie Derkins answers, and kicks him in the balls.      May 5, 2004   10:00pm--   I kiss Suzie goodnight after the dance.   11:00pm--   Big Z gets arrested for drinking and driving.      October 11, 2024 9:07am--   I purchase the "Kwik Stop Gas & Chow" on Pleasent Street.    Good Times.

       TODAY'S ROLE MOMOS   Citizens of the world, we are all asleep in the backseat!  It's time to wake up and say, "Hey!  It's my turn to drive, bitch!".  If we don't, this road trip will take a wrong turn on Gas & Food Exit 86, sending us to a secret Nazi Township in Montana where "Deliverance" becomes our reality in a dirty basement.  Ain't that something to look forward to.  I don't know about you, but I'm tired of sleeping, and at the very least, I'm riding shotgun for the duration, and for those of you still slumbering, I'm gonna throw CornNuts at your foreheads until you come-to.  Today, we will talk about today's Role Momos, or "models" as some people call them.  These are the people who we love to love, or hate to love, or love to hate.   And away we go...   Pope John Paul II...  ...is sleepy.  Somebody get the Pope a Caramel Macchiato.  Either that or a good blow job.  You would think a man in his position would at least smile a little bit, no?  I mean he has G-D on speed dial, that should be slightly comforting!  The Dahli Lama has a happy face, why can't the friggin Pope? Maybe he's just constipated all the time, or maybe he's bloated, cause he does have the look of "Man, I can't hold this fart in any longer."  He just looks so tense!  Come to think of it, I'm not sure if I have ever seen him move his arms or legs.  Maybe he's just a head attached to a synthetic body? Next time I see him, I'm checking for stitches.   George W. Bush...  ...is dumber than pigeon shit.  I'm sorry, but watching this man do anything is like watching a toddler wander through a hardware store.  The President exemplifies the phrase "impending disaster".  I watch him walk across the White House Lawn, and I'm just waiting for him trip over his dog, and fall into Laura's boobs. I watch him give a speech, and I'm waiting for him to slip up, followed by that awkward moment when he searches for his place on the teleprompter. Those technicians gotta be on their game.  When Clinton was president, they could just smoke a doobie and eat some Cheetos, no worries.  But with this character, they must be sweating like a snake's ass in the Gobi Desert.  But what is most entertaining is watching Bush "listen" to somebody.  It's like watching Homer Simpson at a Harvard Philosophy lecture.  Hilarious, simply hilarious.  This man should have his own sit-com, and no laugh-line would be required.  You remember when he had that Band-Aid on his face?  How about the incident with the pretzel?  This is great comedy, baby!   Arnold Shwarzeneger...  ...is the Govenator.  Did you know that in the same week in which Arnold became Governor of California, some poor woman was fired from NPR for using the "F-Word".  Mr. Universe was accused of 15-acts of sexual-perversion and harrrassment, adultery, steroid-use, making "Jingle all the Way" and "Eraser", and being a fan of Hitler, and he was elected to one of the most important offices in America while this poor woman was fired because of a little swear-word?  We're talking three consonants and vowel here!  And the best part is she was simply quoting a book, and the producer was supposed to bleep it out!  Somebody, please, kick me in the nuts!  This man has had more orgies than Wilt Chamberlain, and can't even pronounce the state he represents, and now he's in Public Office?  I feel bad for Maria Shriver, she should go find Uncle Ted and get plastered.    Dick Cheney...  ...is a money-grubbing piece of cow-sh!t.  Just wanted to see how that looked in print.   Mel Gibson...  ...was so much cooler as Martin Riggs.  That Riggs was a bad mother-fucker. Now, he's more like "Multiple Miggs" from "The Silence of the Lambs".  Screw Dianne Sawyer, let's get Mel to sit down with Hannibal Lecter.  But I digress...Mel Gibson is a big disappointment.  I mean, I think Jesus was cool, a real soulful-dude, but he gets enough press already!  Last time I checked, Christ is doing pretty well.  I'll be honest and say that a small part of me really wants to see "The Passion", but that is only because of the off-chance that Danny Glover might pop-out of a Shwarmah and say, "I'm too old for this shit."   ...Just to name a few, and plan on me bringing the thunder with another  list in days to come.    Keeping it real,  Sol Lieberman
