      hello,  well i hope everyone's summer is going as well as mine.  i had my first thai massage yesterday and it was awesome.  cheap too.  i'll give you a brief description if for no other reason than to encourage you all to speed up your vacation to bangkok plans.  -  first i walked into a curtained off area  and changed into a pajama set they provided for me.  then a very nice thai women came in and brought me hot tea, i'm not sure what kind i think it was caffeniated though, then another woman came in and washed my feat with a scented oil,(for those of you who know about how awful my feet are you can imagine how bad i felt for the poor woman) then the massage began.  it is very different than the ones i've had before.  thai massage involves the giver using their entire body. at times i felt i was being stretched more  than anything.  at one point she flipped me on top of her with her feet in my back, it was very amusing, we both laughed.  i'm still a little confused on the exchange rate but i only paid a few bucks for an hour.  o.k. so who's coming to see me?!?  other than that not much to tell i didn't make it to lumphini park yesterday so i think i'm going to go today.  i've been looking forward to seeing some trees.  btw i love pineapple now.  i don't know if it is that much better over here or if being in asia changed my taste in food. either way i eat two or three helpings of it everyday.  wendi and karen (friends for oxford) got into town last night.  they invited me to go to the beach with them and i accepted.  we are going to a full moon festival on an island.  that's all the details i have at the moment i'll let you know when i find out more.  once i get back then the job search will commence.  wish me good luck.  i've got a few ideas and phone numbers so i'm  hoping it won't be that hard.  most people i've met seem to think i can find one extremely easily.  let's hope they are right!  bye,  jane

      well i missed the bus to cambodia this morning.  which means i got up at 5:45 for no reason.  now i have to do it again tomorrow, but the good news is it gets back at 4:00 OR 5:00 in the afternoon so i will have plenty of time to rest for my next week of schooling.  i hope everything goes well. oh and i didn't miss the bus because i was late. i missed it because i had the wrong soi.  btw soi means street.  for example i was supposed to be at sukhumvit soi 21 but instead i was at sukhumvit soi 14.  it really pissed me off because i'm sure the woman told me 14.  anyway....  i'll be at the right spot tomorrow for sure.  i'll even be atleast 1/2 an hour early to make sure and i'm going to call the lady if anything looks suspicious.  i'd hate to  have to miss my first day of a real week of school if i have to do it on monday.  plus those nuns might go nuts on me.  well nothing else to say.  i have my camera but not my usb connector so no pics today either.  i promise to send them soon. gotta run since i have the day off i'm going to do laundry.  love ya.  jane  ps.  for some reason i can't send emails to more than 50 people so shelly will you please forward my messages on to donna, melissa, maryann, etc.  also to whoever would like them.  especially anyone thinking about coming to teach in thailand.  they might find some of what i've said useful.

      hello,  well another day at school.  this one has been extremely slow, but the good news is that i got my new schedule this week.  i'll be teaching many more classes from now on,but since i'm just splitting other people's classes i don't have to do much of the paper work.  yeah!  i'll also be tutoring during part of lunch break, but apparently it is optional for the students and most teachers who have done it before say they usually don't show up.   anyway... i guess i'll just have to see.  nothing else to tell really.  i substituted for 1st grade this morning.  they were so cute but hard to understand because they only speek basic english.  i've got to learn to slow down when i talk to them.  other than that it went great.  some of the kids are extremely shy, but if you make it fun they will participate more.  i've almost got my work wardrobe complete.  i just need one more skirt and another shirt.  hasn't beeen as hard as it seemed at first.  love ya, jane  ps i'm joining a faculty basketball team next week.  yeah!!!  i'm excited to be on the court again.

      hello,  well today was an interesting day.  apparently i got hired just in time for teacher's day.  it was an experience.  the kids all set up in trinity hall which similar to fulton chapel at ole miss or any other large auditorium.  the kids all stand and sing as the teachers walk single file to the stage area where there were chairs for us to sit in.  then they prayed in thai so i have no idea what they were saying.  then one girl read a poem, another  sang, and one read a speech in english.  the speech was about the importance of teachers and how they are second parents to all the students. next one girl for every teacher walked on her knees to present the teacher with a flower arrangement.  the arrangement were so beautiful and the air in trinity hall was filled with the fragrance of fresh flowers.  glad i'm not allergic. anyway.   unfortunately i didn't get to keep the flower arrangement given to me.  also, i found a place to live.  it's extremely close to the school.  i move in on june 25th.  i'm ready to have my own space.  molly's place is nice but i won't miss the commute.  plus most of the teachers i work with live in the same area.  well gotta go.  love ya'll.  jane  ps.  i know how to send pictures i just keep forgetting to bring my camera with me to work.  i promise to send some soon.

      hello all  well sister erlinda is definately a nutball.  she purchased a program for nilza (a brazillian woman) and myself to figure out and teach with.  only she got ripped off becasue the copyright is from the 1970's and the program is not very reputible.  so pretty much i spend all of my day at work correcting papers and figuring out good exercises for the kids to be doing.  another thing that makes it difficult is that i only see the kids once a week so learning names and faces is going to be close to impossible.   anyway...  honestly i only spend about two to three hours in the classroom.  that's going to change soon.  they've already noticed that i have too much free time and they are adjusting my schedule.  yuk. but atleast i won't be sitting around pretending to work.  i must pretend because since i'm new they are keeping a close eye on me.  i think they must have hired incompetent teachers in the past or maybe ones that tried to get away with doing as little work as possible.  honestly i can already tell that once i've been there for a few weeks i'll probably be able to do as i please.  i'm looking forward to those days.  other than that no real complaints.  i never have any work to take home and all the other teachers assure me that this won't change.  gotta go i think i'm going to eat indian food tonight. yummy in my tummy.  love ya'll  jane

      hello all,  well i didn't get to finish the last email because sister erlinda needed to see me.  i'm not quite sure how far i got into my description of the school.  anyway...  one problem i'm having is pronouncing the girls names and telling them apart.  they all wear the same uniforms according to their grade so it makes it even more difficult.  they think i'm funny because i'm so tall compared to them.  one girl even called me big.  it didn't hurt my feelings but i hope those comments are kept to a minimum.  i'm off to cambodia this weekend for a border run.  which means i have to leave the country in order to not pay a penalty for overstaying my tourist visa.  then the school will pay for my work permit next month.  unfortunately i have to pay for the trip to cambodia but from what i've heard this is what every school does.  i guess they want to make sure the teacher is going to stick around before they fork out the cash for a work permit.  anyway.....  not much else to say.  i've got the word on a place to live for extremely cheap very close to where i'm working so hopefully that will work out.  the commute this morning was longer than i'd hoped it would be.  one thing someone asked me is about an example of the improper english used in various t-shirts and what not.  i think my favorite is a bumber sticker that said "do follow me i'm not going"  whatever that means also they commonly confuse wax with vax. i see beauty salons like that everywhere.  the thai people are very nice and friendly which makes things easier.  the only problem i've had so far is shopping.  they are all so small that it is difficult for me to find clothes to wear.  i'm working on the problem.  oh well gotta go.  hope ya'll are having a great summer.  jane

      hello all,  well the job seems to be going o.k. so far.  it's an all girls school run by thai nuns.  kinda crazy.  so far everyone has been extremely nice and helpful but i haven't had to do any real work yet.  the hired me on as an extra teacher so the class size could be reduced from 30 to 15.  gotta go.  jane

      hello,  well i found a job.  i am working at st. joe for a nun named sister erlinda.  guess we will see how it goes.  i am a little scared but not much i can do but give it a try.  one funny thing i forgot to mention about thailand is that you see kids with english written on their shirts but it is usually improper english or does not make sense.  kinda funny.  guess i will be trying to help with this problem.  i have a cell number now so if anyone wants to reach me i have free incoming calls.  it is  010081407.  i am not sure what kind of international numbers go along with that or if that is all you will need to dial.  well gotta go.  jane  ps.  i can not wear pants or skirts that do not cover my knees at the school.  those of you who know me well can probably imagine the pain it was for me to shop today.  but i got enough stuff for a few days.  love ya.

      hey,  sorry for the generalization.  i know not all french people suck, but the party last night turned out to be nancy, me, and a bunch of french people.  they were o.k. at first, but then politics entered the picture.  what's amazing is that i agree with them on most of what they were discussing about bush and the abu gahrib (spelling?) prison abuse scandal, etc...  anyway... they still seemed very attacking.  so since they generalized me i'm just  going to assume they are all shitty.  o.k. enough negative now on to positive.  a few of them were very nice and friendly and when they weren't lapsing into french we had very good conversations.  also, they enjoyed the wines i brought.  which were a couple of australian syrahs. all in all i had a good time vs. a bad time.  i'm planning on moving into vicky's place sunday and then my room will be available on friday.  i'm excited about having a place to call my own.  what's also great is that since it's basically a hotel with special deals for st. joe teachers i get my room cleaned for free.  i'm going to be so spoiled when i get back to the states.  which if i stay as happy as i am now it might not be for awhile.  well gotta go.  jane

      hey everyone,  well i think i'm starting to enjoy teaching.  hard to believe considering all the teachers i tortured in my day.  anyway...  i have a few i'd like to apologize to if i could.  today i've taught cross-stitching, english, reading, and substituted for an art class.  i've learned that being flexible is very important.  there is no organization at st. joe so as long as you look busy it's easy to get away with doing whatever you want.  sister erlinda, the head crazy, caught me on the internet today in the computer room which is supposed to be for students only.  i played dumb and since i'm new it worked.  anyway...  i'd say the most important thing a person needs for teaching is an imagination.  i didn't even know i had one until i realized that if i didn't keep the kids busy they would be going wild.  anyway... another comment on the level of just how spoiled these kids are:  they are extremely well off by thai standards.  they all have maids and other workers doing everything for them.  in one exercise that they had to complete about the environment and preserving energy a question asked them what they would do if a worker left the refrigerator door open.  most of the answers involved the worker being fired. like i said before these girls are brats.  well other than that not much to tell basketball was loads of fun yesterday. i enjoyed playing with the teachers and and the kids.  my skills with the ole b-ball hadn't completely left me.  i even managed to teach a couple of the girls how to dribble behind their backs.  i think i might make it a regular activity for me to play with them every afternoon.  god knows i need the exercise.  love ya'll jane

      hey folks,  well i had to sub for the music teacher today.  ya'll would have loved seeing me trying to sing "three blind mice" and "old MacDonald had a farm" to the first graders.  it was hilarious.  one good thing about teaching kids is that they love it when the teacher acts silly.  also, it makes them pay attention.  so i quacked like a duck, oinked like a pig, and everything else.  the kids are soooo smart they pick up on everything i say and do.  it's really amazing to see how fast their brains can work.  however the older ones are a different story.  they are going through puberty and can be real bitches.  anyway... i didn't have to teach them music lessons.  they just had to do an extra english lesson.  i made the handout extremely difficult so it would take most of the class time for them to complete it.   gosh i'm a mean teacher.  jk.  also, i went to an art opening last night.  it was interesting.  the work was patchwork tapestries done with thai silk and various other fabrics.  of course the ones i liked were sold, but i'm not in the 12,000 baht income range anyway.  wish i were i would have loved to own one of his works.  also, wish i could remember the artist's name.  i'll try and find out.  he's having an opening in nyc next month.  other than that there's not much to say.  i'm going to a party tonight.  nancy, another girl i work with, is having people over.  she's from virginia and very cool.  also, she's a great teacher.  i'm forcing her to help me be more effective with the kids.  i'm determined to make a difference.  hopefully my dedication will survive the neurotic nuns who are trying to  keep me down.  jane

      hello all,  well things are going pretty good here.  i'm still substitute teaching this week.  it's going o.k. they actually had me paired up with another teacher, vicky, to help teach first graders how to sew.  like i said befor these nuns are nuts.  anyway... my only complaint at the moment is that i get told what to do by several different people and all of them contracdict each other.  i just do what i think is best for the girls.  i have had one problem student the same one as yesterday.  she has some sort of emotional problem and i was told by everyone (the first time i've heard a general consensus) that as long as she is not being a major disruption in the class to just let her do whatever she wants.  since she wasn't yelling at me in thai today i let her color instead of do her homework.  well i'm playing basketball this afternoon with some of the other teachers.  i'm looking forward to being on the court again.  it's been awhile.  i'm sure i won't last long.  maybe i can talk them into playing horse instead of a full court game.  anyway... someone sent me a comment about having an advantage over the other teachers because of my height.  well this isn't going to happen.  i'm playing against western teachers male and female and  only one of them is shorter than i am.  actually i'm even intimidate by her because she is actually i good shape.  oh well i'll let you know how it went tomorrow.  wish me luck.  hopefully i just won't sprain anything.  love ya'll.  jane

      hello,  well it's official i'm the designated sub.  i'm actually becoming o.k. with it.  the girls hate me because it means one more english class a day but i've learned how to make them behave a little better.  i did have one serious run in today with a girl who i was told later has emotional problems.  anyway... other than that it was a good day.  i've been meaning to mention a few things about thailand that stand out in my mind.  1. the escalators move faster here than they do in the states. 2. they use corn in lots of their desserts.  for example corn shakes at kfc and the dessert today at school was some sort of corn jello mush.  i thought it was disgusting. 3. almost everyone speaks some english.  even poor looking vendors on the street know numbers. 4.  people seem to eat all the time here.  i've never been out and not seen atleast a few vendors selling all types of thai dishes.  anyway... i got an email asking more details about the school i'm working at so here are a few things that might interest you.  first of all there are 5,600 girls (btw it's an all girls school) most of them are very wealthy by thai standards and many of them would be considered  middle class by American standards.  i found out today st. joseph is one of the most respected thai schools (this does not include international schools which are considered in a different class) in bangkok.  the girls wear uniforms  determined by what grade they are in.  starting with jumpers and ending with skirts and button up shirts with ties which are all in blue and white.  well that's all for today. i've got lots of internet research to do so i've got to go.  love ya'll  jane

      o.k. so i can't figure out how to send a digital picture.  honestly, i haven't taken very many pictures. anyway i'm just not a picture taker.  wish i could for ya'll but my patience is up.  something about the size of the file i'm trying to send.  anyway...  guess i lugged my camera and usb connector to school today for nothing.  oh well,  i'm sure i'll figure it out eventually.  well today was another boring day at school.  i think they hired me so they would have a built in substitute teacher.  i spent all day covering for the thai teacher which basically meant i was a baby sitter since i can't teach thai.  the kids got a chance to catch up on homework in other subjects so they were happy.  this schools loads the kids down with work so any chance to get ahead is usually welcomed.  they are basically good kids a little  spoiled but only a few are real brats.  not much else to say really.  i'm tired.  i think it's from not doing anything all day long.  that's more exhausting than actually working i think.  well hope everyone is having a great summer.  jane

      hello fam and friends,  well.  i made the bus this morning.  i got to the station 45 minutes ahead of time just to make sure and i called and harrassed the woman to tell me exactly where i was supposed to stand and what the bus would look like.  anyway... i got on it just fine.  it was a very nice aircon bus that served us sushi (not great but edible) and constantly provided us with a our choice of pepsi, tea or water.  i'm glad i went with one of the services that does everything for you instead of just going to the bus station and arranging the travel myself.  the part of cambodia we went to, poi pet, was very scary.  i was encouraged to keep my bag in front of me and the tour/border run guides kept a close eye on anyone coming up to me because i was one of only two westerners on the bus and the only western female.  there were beggars everywhere many of  them children running up to me asking for a single baht. also, many people missing arms or legs laying around and one man with only his right leg.  i was afraid to take out my camera to take a picture even. well honestly i didn't want a record of the event.  what's more amazing is that after crossing into cambodia they put us in a van and took us maybe 1/4 of a mile to a casino where they was a full buffet a all types of food available.  mainly asian food but some american style items also.  strange how people were starving just right down the road.  made me feel guilty when i went back for second helping.  well gotta run.  i'm a little depressed now that i put the experience into words.  jane

      hello,  well i went to a going away party last night for an english girl named miranda.  she's moving to chiang mai to study a form of massage.  we had a great time.  almost all of the people i know in thailand were there so it was nice to be around a large group of people and know the names of more than one person.  also, i met a few new people who were all wonderful.  the club was playing awful american music.  i even caught myself dancing to  britney spears!  i can't believe i just admitted to that.  no laughing.  i'm going to blame it on the singha (thai beer).  which btw is pronounced sing.  i have on idea why they add the -ha to the end.  i've been being a good girl and going to the gym everyday.  it's actually an american branch called california.  they have gyms in hong kong, sydney, dallas, and california (imagine that).  it's nice because they use pounds on all the equipment.  well i think i mentioned the large sex scene in thailand in my last message. what i forgot to include was that there is a long history of katoeys (or ladyboys) in thailand.  personally, i always have to have them pointed out to me.  i'm so naive about things like that.  also, with many of them it is impossible to tell.  i would think they could fool most men.  that's all the thailand details i can think of for now. however, i have noticed a few changes in myself:  1. i now say university instead of college because that's what everyone else uses.  this is worldwide not just thai. sometimes i get confused looks from europeans when i say college.  also, an american girl, nancy from virginia, and i were talking today and we both laughed at ourselves for saying university to each other.  2. i've begun to say i'm doing well instead of i'm doing good.  i've always known that it was improper english but it's just so accepted in the states.  3. when asked where i'm from is say america because most thai have only heard of the mississippi river.  i'm just as bad with their geography.  i going to get a big map of thailand so i can look up all the places i hear people talk about.  it's annoying being so ignorant about the country i'm living in.  i really should have done more research into the culture before coming here.  i have begun reading a book about the history of thailand so i guess that's a start.  4. my accent in going quickly.  since i teach conversational english i have to work on enunciating every word.  now it only comes out after a couple of singhas.  i do however still use many southern phrases such as ya'll and fixin' to.  it makes my coworkers laugh.  well, i've gotta run.  i'm not sure what my plans are for tonight.  i might just stay in and read my book.  love all ya'll.  hope you mississippians are enjoying the summer.  it's actually been very nice the past few days here.  i hope it stays that way.  jane

      hello everyone,  school is going great.  i'm subbing today, but the teacher left work for the girls to do.  math.  ugh. anyway... i'm sending this message out a little early today because i have plans tonight.  today the girls put on a play by sunthronpu (spelling ?) anyway... it was in all thai so i haven no idea what exactly was happening.  however some of the outfits the girls were wearing were western looking so i'm assuming the play isn't very old.  i really need to learn more about thai history.  i have a book, but i've been procrastinating.  anyway...  here are a few things about thai culture i've learned recently.  some of this might be a repeat.  the girls believe that the darker a person's skin is then the more ugly they are.  exactly like the high yellow aspect of african american culture. also, in most of the ads and commercials they use asian people with western looking features instead of traditional thai looking people.  i think it's sad.  it's also weird because most of the westerners over here are more  interested in asian looking people.  you see many male farangs (foreigners) with thai women or men.  there is a large gay community in bangkok.  imagine that.  ha. ha.  well gotta go.  love ya'll.  jane

"mr. ibrahim"  it was based on a book.  anyway it was good. i won't give away any details, but i'd recommend it to all ages to see.  school is going fine.  i had a good time with all of my classes today.  also, i got to sub for the p.e. teahcer this morning.  i watched the girls play a thai version of tag.  they all stand in a circle, but they are in pairs.  one girl chases another girl who runs inside or outside of the cirlce. the chasee tags a girl and that girls partner has to run without being caught.  once someone is tagged they are "it" and the chase is reversed.  o.k. i hope all that made sense.  i'm moving into my place tomorrow.  i'm excited to have my own space.  also, it's great to know people in the same building so all i have to do is knock on a door to have someone to hang with.  i worked out at the gym today.  it's a really nice gym.  also, the equipment uses pounds so it's easy for me to know exactly how much i'm lifting.  well i've gotta run.  hope everyone is enjoying their summer.  it's actually not been too hot here so all ya'll in mississippi enjoy. ha. jk.  i miss you very much and hope whoever would like to will come see me.  jane

      well no substitute teaching today.  i had the first graders three times however.  they are wild.  vicky and i are attempting to teach them how to sew.  it's a nightmare.  thirty kids running around with needles!  why the school made this part of the curriculum is beyond me.  anyway... other than that i had a great day.  some of the teachers and i met up for a game of b-ball after classes.  it was great.  i love being on the court again.  the girls love playing with the teachers too.  i'm looking forward to friday when i'll be moving into my own room.  however vicky and i are considering some other options that might save us more money.  i just don't want to commute ever again.  well gotta go. i'm off to the gym.  jane

      hello everyone,  well school is going great.  i didn't have to substitute teach today so it was nice being on my actual schedule.  the only problem i had was with the 1/2 class which is the first graders.  they have so much energy and i wasn't sure how to handle them.  also, i'm still in the habit of talking to fast.  i have to make myself remember to slow down.  other than that the day went by very smoothly.  tomorrow i'm playing basketball again with the teachers and girls.  i had so much fun last week.  the kids love playing with the teachers too.  hopefully i won't twist an ankle or worse hurt one of them.  their only complaint last week was that we were throwing the ball a little to hard.  anyway... i'm ready to hit the court again.  went shopping today.  i hate shopping but this was o.k. because i'm soooooo tired of wearing the same clothes all the time.  i got a couple of things for work and one shirt for going out.  i guess it's nice going on a shopping spree every now and then.  i still have to pick up a few t-shirts, but after that i should be set.  well maybe one more pair of jeans would be nice.  this is one item of clothing that will be especially difficult to find.   thai women are short, small, and have zero hips.  the last time i tried on dresses they had to go to the back and find the largest size for me.  kinda embarassing. so i joined the gym today to work on this issue. jk. i just want to keep in shape and there is a very nice gym very close to where i live.  i'm looking forward to getting on a regular workout schedule.  in oxford i had faye's hyper butt getting me out to the park everyday, but since i've been here all i seems i do is eat.  well gotta go.  love ya'll.  jane

      hey everyone,  well, today was a good day.  i got to sleep an hour later.  well actually i still woke up at six, but it sure was nice to be able to stay in bed until 7:15.  it's only a six or seven minute walk from  silom city court, where i now live, to st. joe.  also i'm probably the most familiar with this area so it's nice to know exactly where i am.  bangkok can be extremely confusing at times.  anyway... i substituted again today. it was o.k. i've devised a way to keep the girls in line so i mostly just get to read a book or do work for other classes.  well i thought i'd give everyone an idea of what a day at st. joe is like. the day starts off with the girls lining up outside of their classrooms.  then an announement is made thru a pa system, always in thai so i have no idea what is being said, then the national anthem is sung by all the girls.  St. Joseph's is a large school 5,600, but it is spread out so while the girls from one side are singing the sound travels from the other side creating an echo effect. then the girls say something in thai which i haven't asked but i'm assuming is something like the pledge of allegiance.  next they turn to the a statue of the virgin mary and pray to her, again all in thai.  finally they bow down on one knee and wai. it was extremely weird the first time, but now i'm getting used to it.  then it's off to the classrooms.  which each grade stays in all day unlike in the states where the kids move from classroom to classroom.  at st. joe it's the teachers who trek around from one room to another.  we do have our own homeroom with a desk and file cabinet.  my home room is 4/1 there are 60 kids in each grade but in the elp (english learning program) which is the  side of the school i teach at they break the kids down into groups of 30.  so for each grade you have 1/1 and 1/2 and so on.  anyway... in the thai section, which is much cheaper to attend, all 60 kids are in the classroom at the same time. i don't have anything to do with that section, yet that is, so i'm not sure what it is like.  i can say that instead of having all of their subjects taught in english like the elp girls are they only have  one course in english.  i guess similar to the way most american schools are set up, well except for the class size.  after lunch the kids line up again and the teacher leads them back to their classroom.   oh i almost forgot this; at the beginning of every class all the girls have to stand up and say, "good morning miss jane" then i have to give them permission to sit down.   then at the end they all stand and say, "good-bye and thank you miss jane".  the first time it happened i had no  idea what was going on and the girls ended up having to tell me to give them permission to sit.  however, despite all the differences a school is a school and everyday i see behavior that would be common anywhere in america or perhaps even the world.  such as teenage girls can be real bitches and the kids will do whatever necessary in order to get out of doing work.  well gotta go, jane

      hey friends and fam,  well i went to a concert last night with vicky and nancy (friends from st. joe)  we had a great time on khao san but the music in the park that we heard sucked.  good songs but terrrible covers. if you can't do a song justice i think you shouldn't even try to sing it.  anyway... i met someone.  so that's good news.  we had a great time and hung out all night together.  i'm looking forward to school next week believe it or not!  also i'm moving into the place i'll be living in at for today.  sunday for ya'll in the states.  if anyone needs my new address just email my mom at REDHILLSWEAVER@MCHSI.COM  she's got all the info on address and phone numbers.  love ya gotta go.  jane

      hello,  well i've been here long enough to miss a few things about mississippi.  here is a list of things i hope everyone down south is enjoying:  1.  taking long country drives with friends, while listening to the grateful dead. 2.  fresh tomatoes from the garden (even though the deer ate my entire garden last year) 3.  having a tomato garden. 4.  fresh air.  bangkok is extremely polluted. 5.  playing ball with faye in the front of oxford apartments while cooking veggies on the grill and drinking a budweiser.  bud is as expensive in grocery stores over here as it is in the bars of mississippi. 6.  my family and friends.  i know it's cheesy but i do miss you.  hope everyone is having a good time.  i love ya.  jane  ps i got my first paycheck today! go me.

      hello,  well this has to be a quick message because i'm running late.  i've been helping out with sewing again today.  first graders with needles!  i think that is all that needs to be said.  surprisingly they haven't taken one another's eyes out.  yet.   anyway...  i also had the first grade for reading class which went very well because it was all about magic.  they loved it.  actually, school has been great today because sister erlinda is  busy with parent meetings.  when the cats away!  so i took a two hour lunch with a few other folks.  on fiday the school is moving into new facilities.  it's going to be anarchy.  nothing ever works as planned in thailand especially at st. joe.  i'm looking forward to the chaos.  i just hope i don't get hurt in all the running around.  gotta run. jane

      hello,  well i finally bought an umbrella just in time for a real downpour.  unfortuantely i left it in the room so it was of no help.  guess i'm still learning.  hell i know i'm still learning.  i had an interesting encounter with a crazy person this afternoon.  i didn't notice her, but some woman followed me home from the gym.  she was already in the hall of my apartment building before i saw her.  then she started talking to me in thai.  i noticed that she seemed a little off so i rushed to my room and got in just in time.  she tried to open my door which i had locked and latched VERY QUICKLY.  she didn't bang on the door or anything super scary but she moaned in the hallway for about thirty minutes.  finally she harassed someone coming down the hall and they informed the front desk about her presence. i'd tried calling the front desk, but they don't have very good english skills.  the guy thought i was trying to rent a room for  one of my friends.  anyway... i'm o.k. the front door guy apologized to me and said that whenever that happens to just tell him "crazy in hotel".  hope this doesn't make anyone worry too much about me.  really i'm in a safe area and i have a safe place to live.  i was just rushing home because of the rain and not paying attention to my surroundings.  so i don't want any emails about being careful.  o.k. love ya'll.  anyway onto my day.  well i substituted for the high school girls again today.  they hate me because i'll only let them speak in english.  even when the lesson is over i tell them they can do homework or talk freely as long as i don't hear any thai.  we actually read a story about oprah winfrey in their book before i let them have free time.  they were amazed that she was from the same area of the world that i'm from.  well i know for a fact that nilza, the woman i co-teach with, is leaving.  she's very unhappy in thailand.  also, she's from brazil so i think the fact that they have her teaching english is a little overwhelming for her.  anyway... hopefully i'll be given her schedule.  then i'll actually have something to do when i'm at school.  right now i just have to guess as to what the teacher i'm subbing for wants me to do.  while i've gotten used to it i would like a regular schedule where i can actually get to know some of the girls.  hope everyone is enjoying their summer.  love ya.  jane

      hey all,  well i got a compliment from one of the other teachers today.  she told me i did a good job keeping the girls in line.  it's a big problem at st. joe because most of the girls are rich little snobs.  they've never had to work for anything and they have awful attitudes.  well most not all and it gets worse as they get older which makes the compliment even more meaningful because it was grade 10/2 which is the final grade.  it really made my day.   it's kinda sad how i go about getting them to shut up.  all i have to do is threaten them with an english assignment and they go completely mute.  which is amazing since they've been studying it since they were six.  unfortunately st. joe tends to teach through handouts and vocabulary lists as opposed to conversational or any other style that makes the girls actually have to think.  anyway... everything else is going great.  i'm starting to fall in love with bangkok.  oh! also, i just found out that i'm getting a week off in july the 12-16 or something like that.  they just bothered to tell us last week.  the farang teachers are always the last to know everything. very frustrating.  right now i have plans to go to the beach or i might go with vicky to hong kong.  ahh!! so many possibilities.  i'm so excited.  we always have a good time together.  well i've gotta run.  hope ya'll are stayin' cool down there is mississippi.  love ya, jane

      hey all,  well it's official.  i'm a fruit.  i can't believe how wonderful all of the fruit is over here.  i like everything i've tried.  i'm on to durian next.  i'm not sure if that is how you spell it, but anyway... it's stinky.  hey i'll try anything once.  i think the only thing i've eaten here that i did not like was a tamarind (again spelling ?)  it tastes similar to a raisin.  well not much to say today.  i went to brunch at kuppa's in sukhumvit.  which is only yards from molly's place.  it was nice to be in that area again.  we bummed around at an art gallery for a while and then went shopping.  i'm slowly collecting a wardrobe.  things are cheap here but i have to force myself to think in baht instead of dollars since that's what i'm being paid in.  ohhh!!!! payday is soon.  i'm going to open a bank account here so it will be easier to put myself on a budget.  well gotta run.  i hope everyone is doing fine.  jane

      hello everyone,  well it feels great to be on vacation.  i don't have to work again until  next monday.  there is a big aids conference here in bangkok and i think  they are trying to encourage people to leave town to cut down on traffic.   anyway...  everything is going great no poop incidents yesterday.  i've  begun playing games that encourage the girls to work on their pronunciation.    thai children/people have difficulty with the r and l sounds so words like  river and liver come out sounding the same.  i think the girls enjoyed it so  i'm going to continue with as many games as possible.  other than that not much to tell.  i might miss a message or two this week  but my mobile should work if anyone needs to hear my voice.  love ya.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ FREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar  get it now!  http://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/

      hello,  well i'm back in bangkok at my favorite internet cafe thanking god that red  ants aren't running all over me.  that was one reason my emails from koh  chang were so short.  the other reason was that i didn't do anything other  than see the waterfall.  i love doing nothing.  i was basically laying  around a covered pavillion on coushions all week.  we played cards the  entire time. spades and chaw di de (i have no idea how to spell this one)   anyway...  chaw di de is a game from hong kong that vicky wong taught us to  play.  i taught everyone spades and between the two games we played several  rounds of cards.  i guess it might sound a little boring to some of ya'll  but it was exactly what i needed.  tonight i have a dinner cruise on the river.  it should be fun i'll let you  know the details tomorrow.  so now that i'm back i have to stop talking about taking thai lessons and  get started.  i've heard of a few people willing that are qualified so  monday i'm going to start calling.  wish me luck.  i know i need it.  love  ya.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ MSN Toolbar provides one-click access to Hotmail from any Web page Â FREE  download! http://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200413ave/direct/01/

       Jane,   &nbsp;   This is Michael Cravens from Louisville - I haven't seen you in years! Your dad has been sending me your emails from Thailand. What you're doing is fascinating!&nbsp; Your last email about showers, squat toilets, and mosquitos made me laugh - because it brought back many memories of my missionary trip for two months to South Korea several years ago.   &nbsp;   It sounds beautiful and I'm sure that this&nbsp;will be a&nbsp;great experience for you.   &nbsp;   God bless. Write only if you have time. Otherwise, your dad will keep me up to date.   &nbsp;   I'll be praying for your safety and a fun experience.   &nbsp;   Michael &nbsp;    Mayo2bog &lt;mayo2bog@telepak.net&gt;   wrote:   From: "Mayo2bog"   To: "Michael"   Subject: Fw: no running water Date: Mon, 12 Jul 2004 17:59:11 -0500    ----- Original Message ----- From: Jane Mayo   To:  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;   ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  Sent: Monday, July 12, 2004 7:48 AM Subject: no running water   well hello everyone,  i'm down on koh chang (i've been spelling it wrong) for the next few days. we got here last night and are going to head back friday. anyway... vicky told me that it was a very basic place where we were going to be staying but not many other details. i'm o.k with squat toilets and staying without aircon but i do have a small issue with no where to take a shower. i basically have to stand next to a pool or standing water and use a bucket to rinse myself off. thankfully some of the other people we came down with, christian from new zealand and kee from bangkok, were unwilling to live that way and got a very nice room  right up the beach.

      hey all,  well it is official the woman running my school is crazy.  apparently she  has a problem with the farangs.  the women she has hired have breasts.  in  her words, "too bulky up top, wear loose clothes, when you look in the  mirror in the morning say am i going karaoke or to school." as you can  imagine i busted out laughing.  also, she has a problem with how we cross  out legs.  we can only cross our ankles.  WHATEVER!  with all the problems  at that school i can't believe she is focusing on how we are sitting.   nutcase.  i'm just amazed someone like her is allowed to run a school.  actually, i take that back mr. cole, my principal, was just as crazy and  unqualified.  maybe this profession just breeds lunatics.  oh well, i plan  on sitting how i please.  she can't afford to fire me right now because she  just had three people quit. HA!  i don't blame them.  one of them was a  really nice Filipino woman named grace.  they pay filipinos slave wages for  doing more work than anyone else.  it really sucks for them here.  well i've gotta run.  i'm meeting a friend for brunch. love ya, jane  _________________________________________________________________ DonÂt just search.

      hello,  well i found a bootleg copy of farenheit 9/11 on the street yesterday.  even  though i don't like micheal moore i thought he did a good job on the  documentary.  definately one sided but not as over the top as he usually is.    anyway... i know some of you have seen the movie.  what did you think?  oh  yeah i only paid $3 for the dvd btw.  ha!  all you silly americans paying $6  dollars to see it in a theatre! jk.  well anyway....   i went to a street vendor yesterday that i used to go to  all the time, but have not visited recently.  i realized while sitting there  that i could see convent rd. (where st. joe is) and my gym from my table.   it was very surreal to realize that when i first got here and was walking  around not knowing where to eat or what to do or even at times where i was  that i ended up at a place that would become so familiar.  now the vendors  all recognize me and are attempting to teach me words in thai.  i'm a  terrible student!  well i've gotta run.  there is a teacher's meeting today in sister erlinda's  office.  yuck.  no jk she's been so busy lately she hasn't had time to  harass the farangs.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ Overwhelmed by debt?

      hey everyone,  well considering it is monsoon season i really haven't had to deal with much  rain.  knock on wood.  however yesterday i did get stranded at a friends  place for a couple of hours.  the rain here is different than in  mississippi.  it comes down very hard and very fast.  it rarely drizzles or  mists all day long like it does for days and sometimes weeks in ms.  every  time it happens i'm always without my umbrella.  i've just got to start  carrying it eveywhere with me.  other than that not much to say.  i just found out two days ago that i do  have to give summative exams.  just another example of how disorganized the  school is.  so now i'm stuck in the computer room all day making an exam for  a class that i have only taught once.  crazy nuns.  well one more thing i've started to notice about myself is that some of the  things that amazed me a first in thailand are now either annoying or passe.   for example on silom rd. i often see elephants hanging out with their  handlers at first i was amazed, then i was told that the elephants are  mistreated and that it is bad for them to be in the middle of a busy ,  pollution filled street.   so now i feel sorry for them.  anyway... gotta  run.  tests to be made.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ FREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar Â get it now!  http://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/

      hello,  well things are going o.k. here.  moving to new facilities has caused the  chaos that i imagined, but i means that sister erlinda is to busy to bother  the farangs.  thank god.  also, she has it in her mind that i am an  exceptionally good teacher which means i am flying under the radar right  now.  i can pretty much do as i please in the classroom which is good and  bad.  since i don't have any books to go by i really have to be creative and  sometimes it works perfectly and other times i have to abandon the lesson  plan and wing it.  some things i've started to notice about thailand recently:  1.  there are some very large thai people.  at first i thought everyone was  a size one but now i'm noticing that there are quite a few obese people  walking around.  i would be willing to bet that this is due from the  american influence here.  2.  people aren't as strict about their cultural rules as i thought they  would be.  i often see people wearing sleeveless shirts, pointing at people,  and changing in front of one another at the gym.  (when i first joined i was  told that only farangs change in front of others and that i should go to the  changing room)  3.  while the thai are buddist this does not mean that a fight won't break  out.  two days ago i saw a brawl in the middle of the street.  men and women  were fighting and throwing things at one another.  i'm not sure what was  going on but i think it has to do with a new food vendor moving into  another's territory.  well i've gotta go teach some little monsters.  hope eveyone is enjoying  themselves.  also anyone headed to the neshoba county fair think of me.  i  hate that i'm missing it.  love ya, jane  _________________________________________________________________ MSN Toolbar provides one-click access to Hotmail from any Web page Â FREE  download! http://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200413ave/direct/01/

      wow,  it is amazing how easy it is to spend money in thailand.  eveything is so  cheap that i justify every purchase by saying that it would be three times  as much in the states.  i've got to stop doing this.  i'm making baht so i  need to think in baht instead of dollars.  anyway...  everything is going  great here.  we moved into the new building yesterday.  it is very nice and  all the rooms have aircon so no more standing in front of thirty kids  sweating my ass off.  thank god.  i'm doing more computer research this afternoon.  hopefully i'll have a new  laptop by the end of the week.  well gotta run.  love ya, jane  _________________________________________________________________ Planning a family vacation?

      hey everyone,  well i've gone from the calm of koh chang to the chaos of st. joe.  the  school is moving into new facilites today.  why they didn't move everything  on our week off is beyond me!   now there are 7 year olds moving boxes which  i wouldn't carry up four flights of stairs.  anyway...  i'm glad i don't  have very many classes this morning.  other than that not much to tell.  i almost bought a computer that i would  have regretted purchasing yesterday.  very hi-tech and way too much money.   the internet really is wonderful sometimes.  i went to a site that warned me  against that model.  yeah me!  thank god the woman couldn't get my credit  card to work yesterday or i would have a crap computer.  well gotta run before sister erlinda catches me in the students only  computer room.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ Is your PC infected?

      hello,  well i went and looked at laptops today.  fun fun.  i basically got a crash  course in computers from a friend.  thank god for computer geeks.  anyway...    other than that not much has been going on i ate some great food on the  dinner cruise.  unfortunately i was seated on the end so i missed some of  the sights, but hey the wine was good.  also, the food was great and the new  people i met were all cool.  there were lots of canadians on the trip for  some reason.  well school starts tomorrow.  yuck.  i'll be doing lots of research and also  we are moving into a new building so i'm sure it's going to be anarchy.  gotta run.  love ya.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ Discover the best of the best at MSN Luxury Living. http://lexus.msn.com/

      hey everyone,  well i got my new laptop.  yeah it is an hp.  so far i'm extremely happy  with it, i still have to get it hooked up to the internet.  contrary to what  most people believe it is not that cheap to buy technology here.   i mean  you can but you have to sacrifice things that are now standard on my things  at home.   anyway... yeah!  i have a new toy.  last night i watched crouching tiger hidden dragon on it to check out the  quality of the screen and it was awesome.  i'd forgotten how much i like  that movie.  if anyone hasn't seen it i highly reccomend it.  anyway... i'm at the school right now.  i have to do some work they just now  told me i was supposed to do.  the organization a st. joe is so incredibly  bad i'm not surprised by anything anymore.  well gotta run.  love ya.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ MSN Toolbar provides one-click access to Hotmail from any Web page Â FREE  download! http://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200413ave/direct/01/

      well hello everyone,  one thing i've noticed about thailand is that everything takes twice as long  as you are told.  so therefore i'm still waiting on my laptop which was  supposed to be in on monday or tuesday.  a little aggrativing but i know i'm  getting a good deal so i guess it is worth waiting for.  anyway... other  than that i've just been invigilating all day.  which is the most mind  numbing thing i've ever done.  i just sat there and watched kids take exams.    ugh!  last night i went out with aurora to a place called the londoner.  it was  great.  also free which made it awesome.  her landlord was there so he  picked up the bill.  between him and niles withers i've eaten two extremely  good meals this past week.  it's so nice to be treated to good food.  anyway... i've gotta run.  nothing else much to say other than erlinda is  back.  she was gone all for the first three days of the week and it was  wonderful.  now she is back raising hell.  i think she thinks that when she  is gone we do nothing.  not true we usually get more done because we don't  have her bugging us about stupid things.  well gotta run.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ Planning a family vacation?

      hello,  well i caught a girl attempting to cheat yesterday.  i was invigilating  (which btw means standing in front of a class a looking at them take a test)  anyway... on one of my trips around the room i saw thai writing on a girls  leg.  i couldn't read it and i didn't want her to know that i saw it so i  just watched her during her math exam.  she wasn't looking at her leg so i  figured it was for her next exam which was in thai.  anyway... i told one of  the thai teachers and they busted her.  apparently it was for her next exam  and i caught her just in time.  GO ME!  my question is WHY CHEAT!  you can't fail so why bother to cheat.  hell, the  school does it for you! i just don't understand this place sometimes.  i'm  also not looking forward to grading my exams.  the kids take them tomorrow.   who knows if they even studied.  well other than that things are going great.  i had three things to attend  last night, but i only made it to two.  i guess that's o.k. the first was a  b-day party for a guy from london.  it was lots of fun.  almost everyone  that i like from work was there.  the next was a going away party for a girl  from france.  she went with me to ko chang.  eve is her name and i think i'm  really going to miss her.  we had just started to talk and now she is gone.   well thank god for the internet.  i've gotta run.  i hope everyone is enjoying the fair.  love ya.  jane  btw if anyone wants off of my email list let me know.  since i have the blog  set up it might be easier for you to just check it periodically.  if you  need the link i can send it to you again.  _________________________________________________________________ DonÂt just search.

      hello,  well dinner with niles withers went great.  he is a very nice man with a  great sense of humor.  it was wonderful to hear old names from louisville  that i haven't heard since i was in high school.  also, he seems to be  keeping up with ms news so we talked about the neshoba county fair and eli  manning.  nice to talk about things i'm so familiar with.  anyway... i have  three different parties to go to tonight.  first is a b-day party for a  friend from work, then onto a presentation given by my friend christian with  free food and drinks, and finally a going away party for a french girl who  is a volunteer here.  well gotta run.  wish i could write more but i'm giving summative exams  today and i CANNOT be late.  love ya.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ DonÂt just search.

      well,  summative exams are pointless and boring.  since you can't fail a kid at st.  joe becasue of the whole losing face thing then why bother with tests.   anyway... all i've been doing all day is standing in front of grade 4 making  sure they don't cheat.  o.k. enough bad now some good news.  yesterday i went to the weekend market  with aurora, teacher from st. joe, and had a wonderful time.  she has lots  of thai friends and they speak very little english so it forces me to use  thai to communicate.  but hey immersion is the best way to learn i think.   well i've gotta run.  oral exams are next and i have to figure out what i'm  doing.  love ya, jane  ps dinner tonight with niles withers  _________________________________________________________________ DonÂt just search.

      hello,  well i went to a fun cool place last night with a group of friends.   actually, two places the first was H1, very cool.  all of you artist on the  list would have loved it.  anyway... the second was a place called zantika  which was also very cool.  i liked it because i finally felt like i was  hangin' where thai people hang.  everyone was dancing to a mixture of music  which was unfortunately bad american pop, but still it was loads of fun.   thai people seem to all dance the same to me. it is very fast and i just  can't move my body that quickly.  anyway... they all thought i was dancing  crazy so they laughed but i didn't care.  anyway... i was there with aurora  (from oregon hippie parents whole name aurora dawn wood)  she attempted to  teach me a few salsa moves. i think i was a poor student.  at least i tried.  well other than that... i was thinking of a few things that i miss about the  states.  1. jon stewart  2. driving  3. good music  4. all you guys  gotta run.  love ya.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ Planning a family vacation?

      hello everyone,  well tgif!  i went out with some folks from the school last night.  we  started at the irish exchange and then moved on to a place called noreiga's.    it was lots of fun.  they were having an 80s night which isn't my favorite  music, but it is tons of fun to dance to.  anyway... i was supposed to met  up with aurora only but tons of people i knew just happened to be there.   some friends i met through molly and others from the school.  it was weird  eveytime i looked up i would see someone i knew.  it reminded me of how in  oxford, ms that would always happen.  other than that i don't have much to tell.  it's been raining more lately.   i think i'm understanding the meaning of monsoon season now.  actually it  think it is starting to rain right now.  i usually just stay in my room  until it stops, but i always end up being caught out without my umbrella.  oh also, i finally got the internet connection in my room working.  yeah me.    i guess i'm not quite as computer illiterate as i thought i was.  o.k. maybe i have more to say than i thought.  sister erlinda called an woke  me up this morning. crazy nun with a bad habit. i programmed in that number  as well, but the sneaky lady most know this and use a different phone  everytime.  she might be nuts but she is no idiot.  well gotta run.  love  ya.  jane  ps i have a little room on my email list now so if you know of anyone who  wants on it let me know.  also you could give them the address for the blog.  _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

      hello,  well yesterday i almost had to take a cell phone from a first grader.  i  couldn't believe it. i mean i've seen the older kids with them, but a first  grader!  she even had the nerve to make a call during the middle of my  class.  i wish i had of taken it from her because it was a really nice  mobile phone.  jk.  anyway...  things are going o.k. here.  i'm glad the  week is almost over.  i have a fairly easy day today so i'm just looking  forward to getting everything done.  this weekend i'm going to a party for a french girl named ermine.  she's  been here for one year and is now headed back to france.  i think she is  going to continue her studies there, but i'm not sure what she will be  studying.  anyway... lately i've spent a good bit of time with her and some  of the other french people.  also, i don't think they suck anymore.   acutually they are very cool once you get to know them.  i think the problem  at first was that their english is not that good so they might feel a little  intimidated when speaking it to me.  my french is even worse so they enjoy  teaching me things that i cannot say and laughing at my drawl when i do  attempt it.  well i've gotta run.  ya'll be good.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ FREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar Â get it now!  http://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/

      hello,  well i went to the hospital yesterday.  bangkok christian hospital right  acroos silom road, which is very close to my school and my apartment.   anyway... it was great.  no long wait and the doctor said just as much as  they always do.  i have an ear infection, that i've had since ko chang, so  he gave me penicillan and ear drops.  probably exactly what they would have  done in the states.  only hear it was very inexpensive, about $22.  not bad  for a hospital visit i think i should get sick while i'm here. jk.  other than that i don't have much to say.  school has been keeping me very  busy lately.  i actually feel guilty about writing this email because i'm  supposed to be grading papers, doing research, and completeing my lesson  plans.  ugh.  i have so much to catch up on i'm not sure where to start.   they sure do keep us busy around this place.  also, sister erlinda is  freaking out about everything today because the ministry of education is  coming to visit the school.  however, the kids are behaving even my least  favorite class was manageable today.  wow.  i wish they were like that  everyday.  gotta run.  love ya.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ Planning a family vacation?

      hello,  well the inevitable happened sister erlinda found out my cell phone number.   damn.  i thought i had hidden it well, but someone must have told her or i  accidently put it on one of the half dozen forms she has us filling out  every week.  anyway...  she called last night to see if i could take an  extra class today.  since i'm more than willing to pick up a few extra  classes a week i wasn't pissed about the phone call just the fact that now  she has my digits and i know it won't be the last time she calls.  ugh!  oh  well nothing i can do now i programmed the number she called me on into my  phone so hopefully i can screen her out, but she is very determined when she  wants to talk with you.  crazy nun.  anyway...  i'm having nun of that. ha.  o.k. i know i'm a dork.  well school is going o.k. i'm working with the girls.  i wish i new more  about teaching phonetics because i think i have a rare opportunity to really  work with the girls.  since i don't have a book and i am basically creating  a class as i go i have lots of directions i could go but i'm unsure what is  the best for the girls.  also, i have so many ages that it is also difficult  for me to complete my lesson plans.  i just don't know until i get into the  classroom what is going to work and what is not.  but hey i'm staying  flexible and even when i have to scrap a lesson plan i still come up with  something for them to do.  well i hope eveyone is enjoying that mississippi heat.  i love ya.  oh wait one more thing.  i've been getting lots of emails saying things  about thailand being so exotic and third world.  oxford, ms is third world  compared to bangkok.  there is everything here that you can imagine, well  except good soul food.  i think some of your perceptions about how and where  i am living might be a little off.  with six million plus people bangkok has  a little of everything.  i hope anyone who wants to can come over for a  visit.  i'd love for ya'll to see the place.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ Planning a family vacation?

      hello,  well things have been going great here.  i'm really enjoying thailand.   yesterday and today are some big buddhist holiday so eveyone seems to be  smilling even more than they do regularly.  i can't remember the name of the  holiday.  i really need to get another book on thailand.  i've read one but  it was just a historical narrative that explained why thailand was never  colonized.  anyway...  i went to soi 4 last night but they weren't serving alcohol because of the  holiday.  which worked out great for me because i'm trying to drink less.   i've figured out that if you don't drink it is easy to save money here.   well you can't save much but it will certainly make the ends meet.  thailand is becoming more and more familiar to me.  i think i could be here  for ages and never know everything but i'm starting to recognize more and  more.  the fruit vendor on the end of my soi (street) recognizes me and  teaches me a new thai word every time i buy fruit from him.  i feel so  healthy here.  i work out at my gym, eat fruit and som tam, spicy papaya  salad that still sets my mouth on fire, also i walk almost everywhere.  if  it wasn't so polluted here it would be paradise.  unfortunaley the pollution  can almost be unbearable at times.  i especailly hate it when i'm eating at  my favorite tofu street vendor and a tuk-tuk comes by blowing carbon  monozide right at me.  ugh!  other than that i've just been chillin' out with friends at the pool and  trying to make myself do work for school.  i actually went in yesterday but  not today.  sister erlinda was so surprised to see me that she didn't even  say anything about my shoulders not being covered.  wow. anyway... i didn't  know on our days off we still had to abid by all the rules.  crazy  catholics.  jk.  love ya, jane  _________________________________________________________________ Discover the best of the best at MSN Luxury Living. http://lexus.msn.com/

      hello,  well i woke up yesterday with a sore throat and instead of being a good girl  and staying in last night i decided to still go to soi 4.  btw soi means  street.  anyway... as you can imagine it was awful when i woke up this  morning.  i don't really feel bad it's just annoying.  so now i'm not going  to be able to make it to a friends gig tonight.  i really wanted to go  because this is the third time that he's invited me to see his band play,  but i just don't think i should.  anyway... today i stocked up on orange juice, ice cream, yougurt, and fruit  so i can be sure to get all of my vitamins.  i also layed out for a couple  of hours to try and sweat any tokins out.  hopefully tomorrow i'll be back  to 100%.  well gotta run.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

      hello,  well tameron, the girl from south africa, was put on a different schedule  today.  st. joe had two people quit in one day.  tanya a science teacher  from australia quit because she got a job at an international school where  her three children can attend.  i think this is a good thing because she was  trying to home school them on top of teaching at st. joe.  also, ultan a  irish man with teaching experience is off to a different international  school.  he was offered 2 1/2 times the pay at st. joe so i can't say i  blame him.  now sister is on the hunt for more teachers but for the time  being i'll have all 30 kids.  honestly i didn't expect to have tameron for  too long, but i was hoping for a few weeks.  people come and go at these  school's all the time so a teacher has to be willing to be flexible.  other than that not much to tell.  i'm going to soi 4 with friends from  school.  that is one benefit of st. joe eveyone is cool and we enjoy hanging  out with one another even when we don't have to.  soi 4 in silom is a gay  area with great music and good drinks.  i'm looking forward to tonight.   it's fun seeing people from work let their hair down and party.  well gotta  run.  i'm off to the gym.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ DonÂt just search.

      hello,  well i'm just hanging out at my favorite internet cafe.  i have internet in  my room now, but i need to get a bunch of downloads and i don't feel like  waiting hours.  my connection is fast enough but downloading songs takes  forever.  anyway... i love my new computer.  i need to figure some things  out and get a digital camera so i can send ya'll pictures but other than  that it seems very userfriendly and reliable.  well knock on wood you never  know when these things are going to die on you.  well today is the queen's birthday and also mother's day.  thai's take the  royal family very seriously.  i've even heard it is improper for them to say  their names outloud.  i'm not sure if this is really true.  also, one of the  thai teachers looks a little like the queen so one of the farang's, ronald  from south africa, told her so and she thought it was the best compliment in  the world.  ronald is a very nice guy with a funny accent though.  he sounds  more european at times to me than south african.  anyway...  school is going o.k.  i'm looking forward to the weekend.  being able to  sleep in today spoiled me so i hope i''m not dragging tomorrow.  one good  thing is that tameron, the girl from south africa who is splitting classes  with me now, is going to take a couple of classes tomorrow.  i think she  needs to get a feel for what it is like to teach thirty girls in case she  ever has to run the class by herself.  i'm sure she'll be able to handle it  she seems like a bright creative girl.  gotta run. jane  _________________________________________________________________ Check out Election 2004 for up-to-date election news, plus voter tools and  more! http://special.msn.com/msn/election2004.armx

      hello,  well i was wrong about when monsoon season starts in thailand.  it's not the  middle of monsoon season it is the start of it now.  well as you can imagine  it is pouring down rain.  apparently it lasts till september and sometimes  into november so lots of rain is coming my way.  i don't really mind, but  sometimes when i absolutely have to leave my house it is a bitch.  also, i  lost my umbrella for a day so it caused me to be a hermit.  i just couldn't  deal with getting wet anymore.  anyway... tameron, the girl from south africa who is splitting my classes  with me, is working out very well so far.  she has tons of good advice and  is very active in helping me plan the classes.  i think she will actually  turn out to be a great teacher if she doesn't lose her drive.  sometimes st.  joe can take the drive out of you without you noticing.  there is just so  much paper work and lots of needless bitching it can take a toll if you let  it.  i try to stay positive, but at times i find myself complaining over the  smallest things.  anyway... the queen's b-day is tomorrow so no work.  yeah!  i'm glad because  i need a day off.  i'm still adjusting to this wake up at 7:40 business.   ugh!  just when i think i have the schedule down pat something happens to  mess with it.  i just have to roll with the punches.  fortunately, having  three older brothers has made me accustomed to this.  jk.  ya'll be good and i hope you are having a good summer.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ On the road to retirement?

      hey everyone,  well i got some great news at work today.  i'm splitting all of my classes  with a new girl from south africa.  her name is tameron and she seems pretty  helpful so far.  it's going to be nice to have fifteen instead of thirty.   especially since i'm working on their pronunciation and the smaller the  group the better to ensure that all the girls are participating and  improving.  having thirty means that some of the more outgoing girls can  really dominate the class participation.  i had one girl flat out refuse to  talk today, but i'm hoping with a smaller group some of the shyer ones will  feel more comfortable speaking.  yeah!  other than that i don't have much to tell.  we have thursday off for the  queen's birthday and also mother's day.  mother's day is always on the  queen's b-day so when i informed the girls that in america it is in may they  immediately asked me why.  why is it in may?  i told them because spring  symbolizes the birth, but honestly i have no idea.  i guess us crazy  americans just picked a month without much going on.  anyway... i don't  think they understood my answer which is for the best since i made it up.   well gotta run.  love ya.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ DonÂt just search.

      hey,  well things are going good here.  i'm a little tired because i couldn't go  to sleep last night.  anyway... long day of classes today too.  also i  learned that no matter how prepared i think i am a class can still go to  shit.  i ended up just making grade 1 write words all day.  i think they  were bored.  actually i know they were bored because they asked to clean the  room. ha.  well gotta run i have people over.  emma, from england and aurora  from oregon are over to play cards.  love ya.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ DonÂt just search.

      hello,  well it's been a busy weekend.  i went to a going away party for ermine,  french volunteer, and had a great time with all the french folk.  a bunch of  germans were there as well so english was the dominate lauguage. yeah.  it's  nice knowing what is going on.  today we took her to dreamworld, a thai  amusement park and tonight she goes back to france.  i'm a little sad  because i was just getting to know her.  the amusement park was lots of fun.  i'd forgotten how much fun it can be to  ride rides and act like a kid.  i'm also looking forward to telling my girls  about it tomorrow because i know it will get them talking.  they love to  hear about what the farangs do with their free time.  well the weekend is almost over for me.  work tomorrow.  ugh.  i've been so  busy i think i need a weekend to recover from my weekend.  well gotta run.   love ya.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

      hello,  well it has been raining like crazy here.  i think i know what they mean by  monsoon season.  i guess it could be worse i could be in bangladesh or iraq.  jk.  no not really i love thailand and especially bangkok.  anyway... school  was a little difficult today.  i'm starting new subjects with a couple of my  english composition classes and it is proving extremely difficult.  also,  while i haven't moved into my new homeroom yet i've been spending more time  in there and trying to get to know the girls.  it's funny when i first  started teaching i couldn't tell any of them apart and i didn't think i  would ever be able.  now i notice all the little things that make them  unique in looks and attitude.  i'm excited about actually being able to call  names in class and not just numbers or by pointing (actually gesturing  because pointing is rude however they don't take offence at the farangs).   while i can learn the names in that class i'm still going to stick to the  numbers in the others to save time.  wish i could learn the all, but with  the number of students i have i don't think it is possible.  maybe next  semester i'll be able to work on this.  sewing class was the most challenging today.  i don't know how to sew and i  told sister erlinda this but she decided to give me the class anyway.  also,  she said the girls already knew how to sew i just needed to make sure they  were doing their work.  NOT TRUE.  a few of the girls can sew and cross  stitch, but not all.  so i was sending the ones with questions to the ones i  thought were doing the assignment correctly, ALSO WRONG THING TO DO.   finally the thai teacher for that homeroom, who incidentally i'll be paired  with as soon as i move into grade 3/2, came in and explained to the girls  how to complete the assignment.  thank god.  love ya, jane  _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

      hello,  well sister erlinda has confirmed it again.  she's crazy.  now she's on back  on her kick about what teachers wear and how their hair is cut.  which is  one thing, but she's lost several teachers this month and i don't think that  alienating the other ones is a good way to keep the staff happy.  also, the  computer teacher might be looking at another job as well so that will mean  that six teachers have left since i started.  anyway... you would think that  she would leave me alone about my shoes.  other than that school is going great.  i'm enjoying the lesson this week  and grade one is going to be absent friday.  yeah.  i love them, but they do  try my patience especially on fridays.  also, i've figured out a way to get  everyone involved in class.  it's a little impersonal but since i have so  many students it is the only workable way.  they all have assigned numbers  which they have to put on every scrap of paper in every class, so i simply  call out a number and that girl has to answer the question, read, or  whatever other task it is that they are doing.  i like it better because it  keeps the extroverts from controlling the class time.  the only other thing of interest i can think of is that they are moving me  into a new homeroom.  which is good and bad.  bad since it is in grade 3/2,  the ones i'm always bitching about, but good because they are finally going  to get me a cabinet which i need desperately.  anyway... i'm hoping that by  being their homeroom teacher they will like me more and maybe pay closer  attention in class.  o.k. i'm trying to be positive, but really i need you  to pray for me.  love ya, jane  _________________________________________________________________ Check out Election 2004 for up-to-date election news, plus voter tools and  more! http://special.msn.com/msn/election2004.armx

      hello,  well i'm doing great.  today's lesson at school went very well. i played 20  questions with them and worked on how to properly ask questions.  it went  great and the girls loved it.  it feels great when i actually get to teach  them something and they enjoy it.  other than that i don't have much to say.  i also had a great dinner with nancy and cammie at a local thai restaurant.  also, my cold is much better.  yeah.  well gotta run.  i'll write more later.  love ya.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

      hello,  well i still have a runny nose and i'm coughing up lovely green colored  phlegm.  i'm sure all of you wanted to hear that.  honestly i don't feel bad  so i think it is some sort of allergy thing and not a cold.  i was a good  girl and stayed in last night.  i slept for around 15 hours.  i kept waking  up and putting in a new movie thinking that i wouldn't be able to go back to  sleep but then i would pass back out before i was ten minutes ito the movie.  anyway... i guess i don't really have much to say.  if i still feel like it  i'm going to the weekend market to pick up some things i desperately need.   things out there are cheap and they usually have sizes that fit so i'm going  to go on a huge shopping spree.  i need so many things such as bowls,  plates, cups, lamps, shirts, shoes, etc.   just about anything i buy would  be a huge addition.  well gotta run.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ Get ready for school!
