      When I was prompted to give the name for this blog I typed down wereallgonnadie. Perhaps there are those of you who are the type who like to know why somethings have the names they do. Like why is the Williamsburg Bridge in NYC named "The Williamsburg Bridge". Or why the McDonalds red-haired dude is named 'Ronald' instead of 'Weird-scary-clown-dude'.&nbsp; Whatever, I'm going to give you the insight to why this blog is named the way it is.   Probably soon before I had started to created this blog I had thought of the many things that may kill us Americans in the years to come. I thought about  urlLink near earth objects ,  urlLink famine ,  urlLink AIDS ,  urlLink multiple wars and unrests ,  urlLink global warming ,  urlLink environmental degradation ,  urlLink the end of fossil fuels  and plain old stupid people. Oh yeah and don't forget todays popular favorite:  urlLink Islamic terrorists . By the way there are other possible causes too, these are just the ones I though of right away today. There's nothing like waking up to another bright new day full of endless possible ways that you can meet your demise. Damn Dog, You feel me? Back to the subject, so in the moment right before hitting submit on the blog creation I thought: "We're all gonna die". That's it! Tie this little tidbit into the time a few days ago when I typed in wereallgonnadie.com and a website came up (for a rocking metal band) and there you have the name for me. I even have a band named after my blog. Ok I know they did come first.   So, we're all going to die. It's true, I swear. I guess your mommy didn't want to tell you this but she didn't talk to you about sex either did she? She's was always trying to keep the good info from you, that and where she hid the Halloween candy.   Anways, I'm putting all of my money on Jesus. Any takers?

      Yeah so that little love fest with my landlord, apparently whatever was good is now bad again. It looks like my landlord has taken off from his family and he really hasn't been around. I don't know if I was able to talk any sense into him, but I feel it may be too late. Him and his wife are not very committed to looking for a solution to their marriage problem. At least that's the way it appears.  As a side note, there once was this time when Frank (my landlord) was in my doorway of the apt. keeping me locked in one of those break-less conversations that you can never get out of. This time he was ranting about how the hispanic day laborers that live in our town are turning the place to crap. Except he didn't say crap. Anyways, one of his more forceful statements was a list he was trying to compile of the options they should investigate instead of hanging around all day waiting for someone to pick them up for work. It went like this: "Either get a life or ... or find a life". Wow, these day-laborers have so many options! "Bievenidos, my friend from south of the border, welcome to the land of freedom known as the US of A. Start your USAmerica experience off right by selecting from the many choices you have. So get a life or find a life. Enjoy your stay."  I suppose we really could dissect the syntax of his statement for there are differences. First of all the difference between 'finding' and 'getting' a life. We could go on for days talking about the philosophical framework for the two words and their ontological consequences. It would probably be stupid though, just like the original&nbsp;statement in the firstplace. Sometimes my landlord is just pure dumbarse. We could have a whole blog devoted just to some of the retarded things he says. But we could also have a blog for all the stupid things that I say. Wait a second, I think that's what this blog is ...

      Me and my landlord had a little love fest today. He was very burnt out from the problems he's having with his marriage. When he first came in he seemed dead-set to go to a lawyer and divorce his wife, and when he left he seemed more intent on seeking counseling and even considering some of his shortcomings. Man, he's a talker though. Anyways, hopefully something better/different will happen but we'll see. BTW, he gave me a hug. :) I think (and hope) that God's spirit was there with us. At times it definately felt like something bigger was going on while we were talking.

      Please allow me to intro-blog myself, and welcome me to this world that I have skirted the perimeters of. I decided to take the step and walk right in. Excuse me if I seem the novice, I'll catch up quick enough. As to the purpose of this blog? I don't know yet, perhaps I'll develop a mission statement of sorts in order to focus the material I post. For sure, nobody needs another stupid blog about just another stupid person. Now thinking about it, I think there'll probably be plenty of journal-like moments. In addition, this blog serves a two-fold purpose, the second purpose being to test the technology for my wife. Beware, be very ... aware.  -Stupid

      I went to this  website  targeting christians that discusses the alleged anti-christian behavior of the current professing christian president George Bush. While some of the stuff I knew beforehand, there wasn't much to get very riled up about, even if you are a follower of Jesus. Don't get me wrong, it puts the President's faith in Jesus into question but it just didn't come as a surprise to me.  Something on the website did bother me though, although it had nothing to do with the intended purpose of the website itself. It was about a  urlLink Msnbc article  in which the President was being asked about different political issues. A question brought up was about the President's involvement with a secret society at Yale known as Skull and Bones. Before this article, I didn't know that both  George Bush  and  John Kerry  are members of this stupid club.  Does this bother anyone else? I guess I just an a little bit concerned that this Skull and Bones is a mite too powerful. Albeit this may be just in my imagination. But there are questions about this secret club. What kind of society is this? What is the influence in American society like? Are they doing illegal stuff? Is there any truth to the wacky conspiracy theories? I'm not willing to go as far as they are and write a  urlLink book  about it based on suspision and hearsay. That probably plays right into the hands of the 'Bonesmen' (members of Skull and Bones). They must love it.  Still there is a problem with a public figure having such a secret, don't you think? Of course people in public life need to have some privacy and everything doesn't need to be known by every Tom, Dick and Harriet in USA. (Are there people named Harriet anymore? Probably not) But shouldn't there be some kind of transparency when it comes to politics. Perhaps I'm asking too much of politicians; to be honest.  And the politicians are asking too much of us as well. We're being asked by these candidates running for Presidential office to trust them with the most important things a nation can posses and the power of the strongest nation of the world. There should some honesty here. Don't keep secrets that can give the impression that I can't trust you to protect the liberty and freedom of the United States or use it's power wisely for the good of it's citizens. The X-files type dudes are going crazy with the connection theories as a result. Now who has more credibility? Jeez, all the drama is enough to make you not want to vote at all, or maybe just  vote for Nader . OK, maybe I got a little carried away there...

      Did you ever take drivers ed? What is the first thing that you're supposed to do once you get in the car? After, putting on your seatbelt and adjusting your mirrors, yeah we know those. What I'm referring to is that you are supposed to put BOTH HANDS ON THE WHEEL. Hold onto this thought because it's the theme for this post.  Anyways, I drive about an hour from home to work and then another from work to home. I get to see plenty of people driving alongside me. And just like any other nosy American, I watch other people. And many people drive with one hand or maybe half a hand firmly on the wheel. And not even close to the 9 and 3 positions. And, yes I do it myself too.  Well, first I thought about the reasons why we were all told in driver's ed to put both hands on the wheel. The reason: incase you need to manuever quickly, especially in the case of an emergency situation or one that could quickly become an emergency. I once saw this internet video of a guy in his car driving with one hand on the wheel and no seatbelt. Of course the video wouldn't have been interesting if he didn't get into an accident, so he did. Yikes. No blood, but you could see how he desperately tried to manuever around his then potential accident with one hand (not very well mind you) before he finally was hit and thrown into the back seat after slamming around the cabin of the car. Hopefully he survived.  So we're supposed to keep our hands on the wheel and our belts buckled. Not because we're planning on getting into an accident, but because it just may happen. Observing the driving behavior of fellow Americans I was thinking that most of the time we are lulled into a false sense of security that would convince us to only put on hand one the wheel and forget to put on our seatbelt.  If you can't tell, this is not just about putting both hands on the wheel while driving. It's more about an American mind-set that's got us all convinced that we're on the good ride and that everything is only going to get better. Being part alarmist myself, I find it hard to buy into this way of thinking for long, although it does get to me sometimes. There are plenty of issues that confront us as a global neighborhood that put us at great risk to ignore. These issues range from the depletion of the world's supply of oil (which by the way is what our economy runs on and how we get our food), environmental issues (global warming, pollution), and stuff like the cost of government, medicare and medical insurance. And lets not forget personal choices too like racking up personal dept, avoiding saving, eating poorly, and bad choices on sex and relationships. And this is not an exhaustive list. Hopefully you can see how the act of taking our hands off the wheel indicates the thoughts going through our minds.  We're all convinced that we are invincible. The majority thinking of USAmerica must be the equivalent of an 18 years old kid who's got it made and never thinks he's going to die. I know that things in American are great, their awesome, and I wouldn't want to live anywhere else in the world. However, we need to be thinking about the future in a manner that makes sense, being politically, financially, morally and personally responsible in the decisions we make for today and the future. In addition, we need to have more concern for the global community that we live in. Let's not forget stuff like the fact that the average age of a civilization is 200 years old and we have only just passed this very meager benchmark. What America needs now is an attitude of diligence and desire with awareness for the unknown ahead. We need to put our seatbelt back on, get both hands on the wheel, and start looking at how much gas is in the tank and preparing for the road ahead by watching out for our passengers and all those commuting around us.
