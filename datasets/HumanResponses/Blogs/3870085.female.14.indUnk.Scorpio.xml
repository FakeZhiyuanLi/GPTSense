        ~Heading towards the New York lights,     fighting for something more in life..     kneeling down against my bed     praying for everything to turn out its way,     wishing on a shooting star     to give me grace until we part     knowing that i will be ok..~

        ~There i was, walking alone     On my own... where do i go?     In a small town like this,     Its hard to find a place to be alone..     Searching deep inside my soul     For who i really want to be,     I guess i have a life to live     and a future right in front of me!~       &nbsp;   Today i went to the movies, and found out that i really wanted something...something that i have not yet had... "how come it is so hard just to find that right man??"       i would love to sit under the moonlight, watching the stars... by an ocean, or by a lake...on top of the dock with our feet hanging over the edge in the water, with a beautiful breeze, making my hair flow.... cuddling with them under blankets outside under the stars just when it started to get cold. i want to be able to share my feelings with them..talk to them about anything and anyone. why is that so difficult?       everyday i find something new about my self, and who i really am becoming!.......

      Hey, ok... Today i have a Photo shoot at 5, and its going to take me a while before to get ready and do my hair, make-up and find something to wear.. cus my parents didnt want to pay $500 dollars so pictures. so we have to do everything ourselves except for the "pictures" lol! make any sense? Even tho it would be awesome if i had hair dressers, and people doing my make-up for me!! oh well. Anyways, i have Cheerleading after, and this time its not 3 hours! It's only 2! But i had some problems with flying and all last time. So I'm going to try and fix them this time. But yeah... thats all for right now, ill blog later on!! *kisses* ~dd~

      ok...So i was at Cheerleading the other day with my bestest buddy meri! for a long ass time. SORRY MERR! 2-8 we were there!! it wasnt suppose to last that long.. but it did! We wanted to hang out with Josh, Tyler, and Jesse because merr was leaving the next day and she wanted to say "bye." It didnt turn out that way, so i get a call from Josh on his cell and he is with Tyler at Mcdonalds.. we say "we are almost home u guys should chill out there and we will meet you so we can say "hi." He says "ok..try to get here quick" so we do! Then we see them pulling out of the fastfood drive way!!... i was starting to get pissed. And i scream at my mom to beep and have them turn around...so she does, and they pull back around, all i wanted to do is say "hi" to Tyler (my boyfriend).. so i do, and Tyler isnt talking or looking at me, and here i am talking to Josh the whole time with my mom, sister, and meri waiting in the other car. (akward huh??) then i finally chose to go over the the other side of the car and give tyler a kiss and tell him to call me later on. He says "ok ill try." then when we got home i called him and he was watching a movie in his room by himself. i asked him what was wrong and he said he didnt want to talk about it right now. so i was freaked out.. i didnt let him know that i was tho.. so i am just waiting for the phone to ring, and it to be him wanting to tell me what the hell is going on. and i still dont know! Oh well... i gotta go take a shower now! *kisses* ~deedee~

Alright is any of this making sense? i dont even know, im just typing along! ha, yeah so lately i have been working out like none other! working my hardest to get in shape for this pageant coming up! yes i almost have good looking abs. awesome huh? well i dont know about you but i love working out and being in shape, it makes me feel better about myself. hmm... well is everyone ready for school? shit im not! i still need to go school shopping and stuff. doesnt it seem like summer went by so fast? psh it sucks ass. anyways, its almost 10:30 so im gonna get going to bed and ill blog later on! alrighty? kk *huggles* sweet dreams everyone!     ~Mea~
