      where is everybody.  We were having so much fun with this thing and now it is no more....Do we need a conversation topic....How about Roller Coasters...    I don't like roller coasters that go upside down or backwards.  I prefer the white water intertubes

      she checks her e-mail when she's at her mom's house which i believe will be tonight and/or sunday night.  so send her an e-mail so that she can join and also so she can look through the site to see if she can access it at her work.  i like the new title, but when i first came on, i was confused (not surprising). i didn't know why i was in this blog instead of at the burd-itti one. now i understand...

      Still bored. The mail came in, but it just doesn't look interesting enough to give up reading and playing on the web.  My brother's not coming to the bar tonight, so hopefully it won't be too boring. Verla, why don't you just come up to Baltimore for the rest of the weekend and I'll take off tomorrow also, making a five day weekend.??  I made Cindy and Pookie watch Kill Bill last night and even though Pookie can't stand tarantino, they both liked the movie, not as much as I did, but at least they enjoyed it.  Netflix should be sending me dickie roberts & scary movie 3 tonight but they are slacking on the indie movie i want.  i mailed all three dvd's back to them at the same time, yet they've only received two.  now i definitely believe they are located in maryland and that their employees must be from the area also since they can't seem to count nor conquer their illiteracy problem ;-) I'll probably post again in a couple hours, but for now, it's time to dig into my boring subway sandwich.  (The woman who makes my same sub every week was laughing at me more than usual today.  And when I say laughing, I mean hysterical, as the other english-speaking employees and I were as well.  She was trying to get me to try something different or add a few more veggies.  She even said she would give me a separate sample cup.  But to no avail, I can only have so many veggies on my veggie sub!)

      So Verla, is this so we can chat without my boss knowing i'm on a personal call? If so, it's perfect! ;-)  Seriously though, i cannot wait until sunday night. i'm drinking and drinking some more. monday morning, don't wake me up ;-)  hey, is the room a smoking room??? And if so, do you mind if I smoke this weekend-days
