          Ladies and gentlemen, may I proudly introduce to you..  me.. as Robin Padilla! ehehehe. Gosh.  I was raised in an environment where most of the people around me were men (well, boys..). I guess nakuha ko yung boyish attitude (and haircut!) sa kanila. Take note: in most of my childhood pictures I had boy-cut hair. Hihihi. Oh well. Can't blame it on anyone, can't I? And I can't really turn back time.  Grabe, those were the days. Hehe. Nakikita ko pa naman sa pic na yan yung facial features ko ngayon. Like the eyes, the chin, the smile, the nose.. Hihihi. At teka, naka-spags pa ako niyan! Hihihi. God, if i was just thin, I  will  wear spags all the time. Hehe. Pero di bale, lahat naman ng bagay may dahilan.  Ayan. You've seen one side of me you've never seen before.

       Gosh. Ang saya saya ko talaga today. Kagabi kasi may nangyari. Sobrang unexpected at spur of the moment. Lupet talaga. Thank you Lord!  "There's something in the way you look at me It's as if my heart knows you're the missing piece."  Grabe. Ang saya saya ko talaga. Ganadong ganado na akong pumasok bukas, kahit ipag-exam kami ng lahat ng subjects, okay lang. Gosh! I am sooooo inspired. Sana umabot tong pagka-inspire ko for the rest of the week para astig. Hihihi.  I wanna fly.. And shout... and sing... "I LOVE YOU 'TOL!"  siyeeeet.  Iba na talaga pag inspired.

Sorry talaga, my dad is leaving on July 1 so the least thing I could do before he leaves is to spend time with him. I'll miss him a lot. Sigh. Oh well. ganyan talaga ang buhay, pre!  How the hell do I friggin' post pictures here? O gosh. Sorry, conyotic ewan ako today. Bakit ganooooon!? Sila nakakapost ng pictures. Tapos ako hindi?! That's sooo not fair. (CONYO!)

       Hm.. I just moved from Easyjournal to Blogspot. Ewan ko kung bakit. I guess mas okay dito, because at least i get to have a different layout. Unlike Easyjournal, na if you're not subscribed to it, yung basic layout lang yung puwede mong gamitin. But maybe from time to time I'll visit the site or write my blog there, pero most probably dito na. I dunno. Whatever. Hehehe.  http://untitled26.easyjournal.com  Grabe. Meron akong teacher na sobrang hate. Grabe... ARGH! ewan! gosh..  I am currently working on our class website. Ehehehe. So mejo busy ako ngayon.   Hm.. la na ako masabi.   Bye!

       "So raise your hands to heaven and pray That we'll be back together someday..."  Sigh. Hopeless romantic nga ako. Nawalan na ako ng pag-asa.. wala. Walang wala na.  'TOL! ANO NANGYARI?!  Gosh. Meron kayang nagbabasa nito? If ever meron, post ka ng comment ah.. Para at least alam ko kahit papaano if someone's reading this.  26 bukas. July 26. Super memorable day. That day, two years ago, was the day naging crush ko si 'tol. Haha. What a name. 'Tol. Kasi naman.. the smile.. the smile.. pare. grabe. Ewan. Ano bang nangyayari sa akin.  Sobrang frustrated ako this weekend. Monday pa lang, I was counting on something to happen. Right before I expected it to happen,   MY world turned me down. My world. My world.     &nbsp;  Lesson number 1: Never expect. Kasi if you expect for something and you won't get it, you'll be disappointed.  You'll be sooo disappointed.  Buhay naman talaga. At some point you're at the top and the next thing you know you're kissing the ground. What is it with high school crushes that make us so attached? Sana hindi nalang nag-exist ang love.. and crushes.. and likes. Para hindi na masasaktan ang bawat nilalang sa mundo. Diba ganun naman talaga ang love? Oo, masaya.. Pero eventually it'll hurt you. Gosh. Ano ba...  'Tol.. ano bang ginawa mo sa akin? I've been dying to talk to you.. Ano ba..&nbsp; I want you to experience how it feels to wait..  Masakit. Masakit talaga . May gusto akong sabihin, pero hindi ko alam.. May gusto akong gawin, pero hindi ko din alam. Grabe. I wish you knew how I feel.  My WORLD turned me down. Shit.

       Wahaha. Perfectionist daw ako. Daw. Ehehehe. Onga naman. Ngayon ko lang narealize yun ah.  Anyway, ang busy ng week na 'toh. Galit ata ang mga teachers sa requirements. Tapos yung isang teacher ko sobrang disappointed sa akin. Oh well. Paminsan din pala nakakainis kapag officer ka o you excell academically. Ang taas mashado ng expectations ng mga tao sa iyo tapos pag hindi mo naabot madidisappoint na sila. Gawsh. Tamad kasi ako eh. Sorry na lang, per ganun talaga ako.  Gawsh. Yun lang. La na akong ibang masabi. Hehe. 'Till then!

        "I think I'll never get over you" is one of the sweetest statements a person could ever tell you. For me that statement indirectly says, "I still, and always will,&nbsp;love you."  &nbsp; What the h*ll is happening to me? This past week has been an emotional rollercoaster. At times I find myself with a tear on my face, and sometimes I smile all of a sudden. &nbsp;Ano ba? Bakit ba? Ano ba yung dahilan kung bakit ako nagkakaganito? Nakakainis na eh. Kung sino man ang nagbabasa nito (and I doubt kung meron), grabe, ang hirap. Hindi ko alam kung bakit. Ang bigat ng feeling at sobrang frustrated ako for reasons that I don't even know. I need a break. I need&nbsp;a new prospect kasi the more that I keep thinking of him, the more that the feeling pushes me down. Kaya people, say "I love you" to the people that you love. Do it for me.  &nbsp; Sigh.  > &nbsp;  "since we met&nbsp;   we never let our feelings go too far&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   from being just friends&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   i always thought how good you are to me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   could we be much more?&nbsp;&nbsp;   where do we begin?...  &nbsp;  it's said that friends can be the best in love&nbsp;&nbsp;   i believe that it's the best way to start&nbsp;&nbsp;   every part of me feels that i'm complete&nbsp;   wouldn't change a thing i love you as you are.."  &nbsp; Kaya pare, if you're reading this, I think I'll never get over you.

       Sigh. Talaga naman. Ang luffet. Senting senti na ako ngayon. Kasi naman.. yang kanta na yan..  Palihan daw bukas. Hehe. Sana hindi ulit nila ako ipag-lead ng prayer on the spot. Sana lang naman.. Hehe. Pero planning lang naman daw tomorrow kasi pupunta kami sa community. And guess what, yung pupuntahan naming community ay yung pinuntahan namin nung first year - BUKLURAN! Yehey! Hehehe. Saya nun. Gosh. Napareminisce tuloy ako. Hehe. We had this story telling session. (at pinagkainteresan ng mga tao yung mga librong dinala namin..) Si teters ninanakawan na.. At may nahuli akong taong nagtetext.. Wahahaha. Hehehe. Anyway, it was fun. So shempre I'm really looking forward to it.   Gawsh. Tapos leadership training sa Saturday. Tinatamad akong pumunta, in all honesty. Gawsh. Lupet talaga.  Anyway, pare, this is for you.  "if i never get to heaven then at least i will have known i had an angel here that I could call my very own and if this world should end tomorrow,  girl this much i know is true i found my piece of heaven the day that i found you.."  -If I Never Get To Heaven (Javier)

       I miss my crush. Grabe. I miss him sooo much.  Tinatamad akong magburn ng cd.. (Yes, gagawin ko na yung cd 'tol!) Pano ba naman, Lea Salonga.. Ayos. Oh well. Respetuhin na lang natin sha. Ganun talaga ang life no. Gawsh.  Ayoko pumasok bukas. Tinatamad ako. Gawsh. What's happening to meeeee????!!!  "Young girl, don't cry I'll be right here when your world starts to fall.."  Gosh. I wanna hug someone. Awww...  Okay. Better make those cds or else he'll kill me.

       Grabe. Emotional ang araw na 'to para sa akin. I cried my eyes out in front of the whole class, (and yes, some teachers saw me cry..), and.. grabe. Ang dami kong natutunan. Poeple fear me. Omigosh. Ganun pala ang aura ko. Gosh. Guilty tuloy ako. Daming may masamang loob sa akin.  Quite frankly, my perceptions of a true "friend" changed. Now I know who my friends are. BIATCH! hehehe. Nakakainis lang, kasi nakakainis lang talaga ang ibang tao. Basta. Anyway...  Gosh. What a... BIATCH!

       Gosh. I am facing x hours of nonstop studying. Meron daw long test sa English tomorrow tungkol sa English Literture (including all the periods and writers). Okay. So sana by the end of this week buhay pa ako. Meron ding short quiz sa Filipino tomorrow. Kelangan ko mag-aral kasi nabagsak ko yung first quiz. (tsk tsk, Kara..) And so before I lose my nerve studying, I decided to write a blog entry. (Hehe. Parang mejo obvious na maling mali yung priorities ko..)  I am now officially selling bags. Puntahan niyo! www.picturetrail.com/drei7 Remember my post about someone having ill feelings towards me because I still haven't given his CDs? Grabe. Nagkita kami kanina. Gusto ko nang magtago sa hiya. Ayoko naaaa! Gosh. Oh well. Ganyan talaga ang life. He just sort of smiled at me.. Ewan ko kung ngiti dahil sobrang naiirita na o ewan.. Gawsh. Anyway..  Okay. Hell day starts in 3...2...1.

       (Okay, I guess I have to apologize for the uber big picture. I still don't know how to resize pictures here. So, if anyone knows how to do it, please do teach me."  Anyway.  Have you read the book, "The Blairbitch Diaries"? Grabe, that book is hilarious! Must read yun!!  After my looong hiatus, I must strike again! Wahahahahaha.. Gosh. A lot of things have happened during the time I stopped blogging. My dad left for the States last July 1, which left me very emotionally unstable. My mom had to bring me to school that day.. God, I remember finally gaining composure, and my dad called, and I cried my eyes out! What a day.. what a day..  I am 100% sure that someone has ill feelings towards me. Sino? Ewan ko. Hulaan niyo! I was supposed to give him his CDs last week.. ..And i doubt if i can give it to him this week. Gosh.. Grabe na talaga. Ewan.  I have officially started selling bags. Baka gusto niyo bumili, just go to this site: www.picturetrail.com/drei7 .. haha. Tell me if you want to buy anything

        Haha. I cried my eyes out today. But I'm feeling much much better know.. So.. Ayos na.        Not all people who smile at you are your friends..       Anyway..      I still don't know who anonymous is. And I'm starting to think that pinagtritripan lang ako ngayon. So.. okay.. wish ko lang..      Haha. suprsingly, wala akong crush ngayon... right now.. haha. weird.      anyway, wala lang..

       Gosh. I've been thinking about you all day. Grabe.. Who could you possibly be? You have to be my friend in friendster, kasi dun ko lang naman pinost yung url ng blog na 'to. I only know one person who writes names in all caps, but then hindi naman sha gumagamit ng comma.. Omagosh.. I feel.. violated (?!?) Who are you? Hehe. Although somehow kasalanan ko din iyon kasi sabi ko before to post a comment.. Ahahaha. Anyway.. Ewan ko nga at baka pinagtritripan ako..  Exams pa rin namin bukas. Geometry at Filipino. Geometry is quite easy, so no need for thorough review. Pinoy ang major concern ko.. Honestly, Pinoy is one of my weakest subjects. Pati soc sci.. Mahina kasi talaga ako sa tagalog eh.. Yung mga malalalim na words.. wala. hindi ko maintindihan lahat. Kaya hopefully through intensive studying and memorizing ay mapapasa ko yung test..  Anyhoo, gosh. I should be studying by now...  ANONYMOUS! sino ka? please email me or text me your true identity.. (yak, parang sci-fi film..) pero serioso, sino ka ba talaga? Kasi if you are the person that I think you are.. WE DESPERATELY NEED TO TALK.  Gosh. I hope your get to read this.

       Grabe. Tadhana naman talaga. One minute I'm kissing the ground, the next minute I'm in heaven. Gosh. I got to talk to 'tol today. Pero sandali lang naman.. Mga 30 minutes. Nonetheless, 30 minutes pa rin yun. And we talked about a lot of things.. He calls me lola; I call him lolo. Wahaha. Pareho lang kaming bangag ngayon. Sorry na lang..  I crave churros. At take note, pareho kami ng craving. Wahoo!  By the way, my algebra test sucked. Hindi na ako magugulat kung hindi ako OS this quarter.. Haha. Uber depressed ako kanina, tapos after i talked to him, heaven na! Lupit talaga. Take note.. uh.. nakalimutan ko tuloy yung sasabihin ko..  Wahahahaha. I should be studying right at this moment. Ahahaha. Talaga naman ang buhay..  Ayun! Lam niyo ba, nagkaroon na naman ng pressure to tell him na.. yun na nga. At hindi ako nag give-in.. thank God..  Sabi niya, imimissed call daw niya ako so i can call him ulit. Naputol yung conversation dahil kakain daw sha. O sige, fine. At take note, anong oras na? Wala pa ring missed call. Ayan. I hate people who don't stand by their word. Anyway, whatever. At least i got to talk to him..  Grabe. Destiny talaga.  Love you 'tol!

Punong-puno na ang utak ko ng information related sa Home Ec. Goshers... cooperatives.. partnership.. marketing.. entrepreneurship.. waaaaah!  I need a break. I need a kitkat.  My dad already has a friendster account! ahahaha. Yay! At least updated sha sa mga happening sa buhay ko, at updated din ako sa mga happening sa buhay niya. Wahoo! ahahahaha.  Pardon me for laughing too much. Sugar rush yan 'coz i've been eating too many sweets lately.. Gaaaaa.. Sugar! Sugar!  Bangag na talaga ako.  Something has been telling me na iiyak ako this week because of someone.. Ewan ko kung bakit.. I just have this psychic feeling na hindi ko maexplain.. Gawsh. this sucks..  Kinakabahan na talaga ako.. Hindi. Kaya ko yan! If only i had a little bit more of some inspiration. Ahahahaha. Alam ko na! Sesendan ko si 'tol ng quote. Bwahahaha.  'Twas the night before the exams. and what am i doing? blogging.

       Haha. I now officially write songs. Pag meron akong nabuo, I'll post it here. Haha. (as if someone is actually reading this.)  wala lang. Trip ko lang magblog ngayon bago ako matulog. Haha. La akong masabi.  As for my crush, I still miss him. I've dreamt of him lately. Haha. Ewan. Tagal na naming di naguusap.. Busy lang talaga. We really can't make both ends meet, so la talagang time na puwede kaming magusap. If i'm free, he's busy. But when he's free, ako naman yung busy.  Damn it. I think I'm hungry. I think..  Churros! god.. I'm getting fatter by the minute.  Exams na namin this week. Crap. Ibig sabihin, wala na naman akong pag-asang magkaroon ng tulog. I really need to make good kasi gusto ko talaga maging OS.. third year na. I need to take things seriously to achieve my dreams.. (naks!)  Teters and i are planning to make a class album. Yes, kinacareer talaga namin.. Ang ganda kasi talaga nung mga songs na cinompose ng class. The best.. swear.. Hanga talaga ako.. Galing natin iii6! Ayan, testimony yan that our class just keeps getting better and better. ahahaha. sa mga taong nayayabangan, sorry na lang kayo.  I can already hear it.. "now in cds and cassettes.." La pa kasing name yung album.. meron palang dream.. But i'm sure pag sinimulan na namin ay tuloy tuloy na yan..  I have no intention to burn CDs this week. Sorry na lang sa mga taong nagpapagawa. Hopefully if i finish studying early i could finally make them. Ahahaha. Oh well. After exams na lang.  Speaking of after exams, some of my friends are planning to go ice skating in Megamall. Sama ka? Naku. Megamall makes me think of someone.  Speaking of someone, haha. grabe. I learned something new about a particular perosn this weekend. Grabe. People really do have their dark side. And when I say dark, I mean DARK. Grabe. Sorry, i'm still suffering from aftershock. Grabe talaga. Lupit. Buti hindi ko nadaanan yun.  Senti na ako ngayon. "If i never get to heaven..."  Gosh.. A former uber uber uber close friend texted me last night. Actually i sent him a quote, tapos he replied. Tapos kinamusta ko.. At hindi na nagreply.    I hate people who don't reply to your text messages.        Ayan. If you want to get along with me, magreply ka para hindi ako maasar sa iyo. Isa akong taong madaling magtampo.  ..And i hate people who don't stand by their word.  "Girl I know we'll make it through the rain together..."  ----  "and when all is said and done the world will not stop turning and still i will always love you until the end of time.."

Pero mukhang busy sha, at in fairness busy din naman ako.. So.. ewan. (ang labo ano?)  Damn it. Alam niyo ba na I wrote an uber long entry last july 26 tapos hindi napost? Ayoko nang ulitin yun kasi wala na yung thrill at inspiration. Bad trip. Oh well. Ganyan talaga ang life.  Hell week alert! Hell week alert! Wahahahahaha.  Gosh. Bago ako tuluyang maloka, sige, bye na.
