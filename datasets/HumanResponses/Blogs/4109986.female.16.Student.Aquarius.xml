      So the past few days have been kinda really wierd. Starting with Saturday...so we had a family get-together and that went great then we went back down to our boring ol' Skaminia Co. Fair and that was all going to good untill about two hours into the dance...my cuzin from washougal was down and she decided to run off with one of my friends that she didn't hardley know which was fine until her grandma called me and told me she was coming to get her and then we all ran around until midnight trying to find her. I'm glad we finally found her. Then Sunday I had another family get-togther and my crazy cuzin which I hadn't seen in five years was up from Texas. Yeah so we ended up getting into a chockolate cake fight and whipped cream fight and let me tell ya it was a load of fun. When Monday finally rolled around my cuzin's Mandy & Carlie spent the night at my house which was a lot of fun until my cuzin Mandy decided she wanted to get all but-hurt because someone that she likes found out and I sware I didn't tell him but he found out and she thought that I told him so she got all pissed off. But we some how worked things out which was really good.    Anyways to Today Tuesday...when my mom left the house this morning I didn't know that when she would be getting back I would have a really big mess to clean up because she tore appart her bathroom looking to the hairspray which I might add was on the bathroom sink!!! Oh-well but anyway she started telling me these stories about when I was young about how I liked this boy a lot and he ended up moving to New York because his mom was model and his dad was a very high payed business man. Anyways Alisha (his mom) called me today and told me that he was in town on a business trip and he wants to meet up with me! well I'm off for now I got a long day a head of me tommorow!! Ta Ta for now~  *"Dont Know What To Say Or Do"*

      Ok so yesterday was totally amazing!!!! During the day was kinda boring but when 4:30p.m. rolled around everything got better. First-off my tahoe wasn't running right and that really sucked. But then we kinda got it fixed. Secondley we ended up borowing my grandparents vehical. That was cool. Then we were off to the Clack Co. Fair for some Freestyle Motocross some Quad War's &amp; some Mini War's it was awesome. I wasn't really into the Mini War's but the Quad War's and the Freestlye WAS AWESOME!!! Clark Co. got there first backflip and tons of amazing tricks. And I got to get it all on camera. I have got some of the most awesomest pictures that I never would have imagined capturing of my digital. And I had a really great time!! The Quad war's were awesome too there was the Washington team .VS. the L.A. team and of course for the third or fourth year in a row WASHINGTON KICKED ASS!! It was awsome! well anyways off for now. I'm going to go get into a little bit of trouble today! Tata for now!

       I was sitting here thinking about everything and I came to the conclusion that eventhough the world goes round most things are square and or rectangle . What I mean by that is everyone lifes in a house and almost eveyone drives in a car. There fore when a person wakes up in the morning they are in a square which is there room rather it be the same room the grew up in or not they all look a like unless they are painted which is a totally different story. But when the terms everyone uses start with "well that's what makes the world go round" it makes me want to say everything in the world is square or different and oddly hardley anything in the world now is round. Anyways if you get what I'm sayin great but if not oh-well its all good!!! ta ta for now!      *feeling really confused*

        So. Today was a lot of fun...haha! Its been a long, long day. Today I woke up at like 7:30a.m. to babysit a really good friends kid. Its was a lot of fun. He has so much energy, he loves to run run run!!! But its been great.  Working for once is keeping me out of trouble instead of getting me into trouble. Anywho I'm off for now.

        The past two days have been a shit load of fun. My cuzin whom looks a lot like me except shes a lil' bit skinnier has been staying with me. We are like sisters. What is really cool is that she looks up to me. So pretty much everything I have she wants or sometimes its the other way around. Its awesome. Well I'm off for now!

        How come it is that every time I do something right I think about you? I think it is all because I love you. It feels like I'm loosing my bestfriend when your not around. When are you ever coming home to me? Is it over between us? I hope not because that would be so very sad. I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART!! Please dont ever give up on us. It would be terrible. Thank you for always being there to listen to me even if it didn't make to much since. You are the one that has held me together. You have truely had me from "HELLO"! :)          Well I hope that you got what I'm trying to say! Thanks Honey!!

       So today was a lot of fun. I spent the day with my mom. We went to the mall! I spent so much money. Over $500.00 I think! The damage me and my mom can do when we are alone. My dad, uncle, brother, & friend went to the AMA Motocross Nationals they had a blast. A part of me wishes that I would have went with them but I think it was great for me and mom to spend some time together without killing eachother. It was great. Well off for now!
