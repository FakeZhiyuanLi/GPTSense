       listening to: the hives - b is for brutus  nothing thoroughly interesting, except that i'll start up my own website probably, if broedom continues at this rate ! well got my hair cut, because it used to be really and now it's really short, which is quite nice in summer, because it's not so hot and dries quicker after swimming, and after that i visited denise and sonja, for a good hour and a half and phoned around with flip and chris&nbsp; and thomas and sonja and arranging a meeting in the park, cora and bianca and markus 8 a drummer we got to know last week, really nice guy) and ralph were there too, again ! michi also came along (she is my neighbour and a friend of mine) and told us about her week in the czech republic !but this time we all&nbsp;went home earlier ! then watched the beginning of 'cats & dogs'&nbsp;at michi's house !&nbsp; next day i just sat around and watched the average '8 mile' and then went to see the highly anticipated 'spiderman 2' with sonja ! and then drove home by bus with her and had a long phone talk with michi because she was bored ! today i sat around again, played guitar, but got my glasses fixed, went to get the magazines more and the gap and a spiderman action figure, which i wanted to doat the last movie already, but they were sold at that time ! then got myself ice tea and listenend to fm4 and now i'm recapturing the previous days and right now i'm gonna call thomas and christian and ask what we're gonna do tonight ! cheers, thomas !    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      wow, at last, something to do ! last day for denise in graz because she'll go to italy for a week ! hmmm, what am i gonna do without having the chance to go for a walk ? anyway so we went to drink something at 'stern' (ice tea and summer just go hand in hand) and after thomas went, we wanted to walk around and ended up at the playground in the huge city park, and played around there ! later sonja and me had to drive back together by bus, because she was sleeping over at denise's house ! and our relationship is really strange, we used be really close friends and now we barely talk, and if about our school time together and about this guy who used to be my best friend, whom she meets regularly, but we found some subjects ! nothing more special, cheers, thomas !

       listening to: the hives - love in plaster  oh god...from the promising and eventful start of this summer (or a s you might call it-raining time)&nbsp; it all went downhill, and now i sit around bored and do nothing mostly ! all i did on the last 5 weeks, was just play guitar, read and swim...i mean, yes, pretty cool i get to play a lot guitar but...everyday ? at least i do something at night, went to see wondrboys (excellent movie with michael douglas, best movie with him) and drank my first miller beer, which is amazing ! and yesterday i had a long walk again with denise, and when we went to my house a little i beat her with almost every character in street fighter 2, cause she was complaining i always used blanka and his shock abilities&nbsp;and so i had to fight her with all of the bunch ! but she's a lot better at super mario bros. 2 ! then yesterday i got the new hives album which i am listening to now, which is amazing ! gotta get a new haircut tomorrow, my hair is all grown out...cheers, thomas !

       listening to: the hives - hate to say i told you so  bah...i did absolutely nothing yesterday, except maybe for guitar practice ! and that was it ! then i collected some of my favourite text pieces froms ongs for a blog ! yes, i am that bored ! then i stayed up, and at about midnight i wanted to go sleeping but mtv's 'spin', the only show with actual taste on mtv, kicked in with a the hives special ! i was kinda disturbed to see a kraftwerk video, but nevermind, then followed a the hives live concert, which was cool, and then suddenly my cell rang, and it was denise again, but we didn't break our record, thougb i think we made about 20 minutes for sure, adna was on the phone,too ! today i might go to the mall with denise because we want to go into the sex shop and buy a card game and an inflatable man for adna (not that she actually needed him..but...you know) , looking forward to this, if she'll ever call back ! gotta get out my hives records now...

       listening to: david bowie - rebel rebel (classic)  phew, so i better look up what was last first ! nothing to special happened, alright so i had a picnic with denise, because she swears there is some strange car driving around that looks like a battered tank and i said i wanted to see it, and in time we developed the idea of a picnic, later went out for a beer !  oh btw, over and the nice label that is matador you can check out the shiny new interpol sleevework ! looking fine ! well i played quite a lot of guitar the last days, in songs: break on through, c'mon c'mon, i just don't know what to do with myself (because it was fitting), little acorns, clash city rockers (today), the new (intro so far), where are we runnin', and i'm currently trying to&nbsp;figure out how to play 'jail guitar doors' right !&nbsp;i also developed some strange,really weird intro, and played it to chris yesterday and he totally liked it ! alright so in terms of going out, i went out to stadtpark the passing days (think it was thursday) , once with denise, sonja, thomas but i just can't recall how lang we stayed and what happened, but thomas and i were hired to, i don't know exactly, for a small job which is being bringing torches marching into graz or something along the lines of that ! on saturday, it was stadtpark again with sonja, chris and thomas and in there we met cora and bianca (friends of ours we know for quite a long time now), and they sat themselves to us along with ralph (former classmate of thomas) and markus, a guy which should turn out to be a drummer, so we exchanged numbers and probably meet him sometime this summer, what a nice bloke !&nbsp; later, thomas' bike was stolen and way later denise invited us to her fathers house in andritz because she was home alone, and we watched some weird computer animated bunny that was reading out sms, and so much of them were related to weed ! later we all got really tired, and i had to sleep between denise and sonja, which was a little bit unnerving when they started talking like babies...yesterday christian was around the whole day we tried to figure out what to do, and we went to the cinema later to see shrek 2, which was hilarious, and then to the continuum to drink a shake, but i got sick of it, because there was too much coco in it ! then later denise called and we talked about 2 hours on the phone ! probably my longest call ever ! today i don't know yet what i'm gonna do, but i think it'll be surprising !

       listening to: joe strummer and the mescaleros - coma girl  (one of the most beautiful songs ever given to mankind by one of the most interesting people in music)  ahem, so budapest, i'll sum it all up into a blob of words and activities just so you knwo what happened i'll try to put it in chronological order blah... crossed border, slept in, woke up when already in budapest, sleeping around for another couple of hours, eating in a restaurant with my father and a friend of his, bad back problem that caused me watching intelligence-destroying personality-absorbing mind-numbing talkshows, but went on to read something in order to try to recapture a faint bit of braincells, wento the cinema, saw 'secret window', shot zombies (um...nevermind that one,actually), went to sleep unbelievably tired, woke up, wandered around budapest alone, found shopping mall (ga-hey what a nice way to destroy environment and transform us all into consumation-fixated polyviduals, and i want copyright for that word), ate a burger and fries, failed to speak hungarian properly and had to eat a brain-freezing ice instead of a nice coffee, rested, got new albums (the cure and the killers, no punk there, folks !), went to got to a neat second hand store named ciankali (oh the irony of having a rat as your logo), went to a chinese market and found an incredibly stylish absolut vodka tie, went to see the excellent ladykillers with a pretty solid tom hansk whom i normally despise and drank beer on the way home with my father, next day got up late, ate mexican with my dad and his friend who gave a huge staple of nme's to me which is absolutely fantastic,packed in stuff from my dad because he's moving away, got out of budapest an hour and a hald too late but arrived in time for a party at home with my friends, drank czech beer which was absolutely fantastic (i don't know why i'm so enthusiastic about things today) and got a little wasted !  so yesterday i spent my time reading some nme's ( n ew  m usical  e xpress, you amateurs) and then had a about 4 hour walk with denise, full of nice conversation and laughter, just like your favourite dialogue movie !  today probably had the longest sleep of my entire life with 11 hours ! read only one nme (gotto save them up a little more) played guitar,battered the drums, rode around with the bike, read fm4 articles, cleaned my room, and went out with thomas, sonja and chris for a beer at a pub (flann o' brien to be detailed 'she swears i'm a slave to the details)') and cruised home, on bike ! now i had nothing to do and decided to update this lonely, sappy blog with an almost epic entry ! looks like they're getting longer and longer

      i'll pick up with the rest of yesterday ! i went there and thomas, sonja, adna, denise, christian and various other friends were already there and i chatted with all of them ! later i went home to get some guitar picks for sepp ! back again we wandered around the whole area, and found anna, julia, miri and some others from our parallel class whom were pretty wasted ! we got ourselves some beer later on but unfortunately it was warm, which made it near the untastable ! not to mention i get drunk easier by warm beer ! three beers in i was a little drunk already, though one of the beers was cold ! later our italian teacher asked if the situation on czech republic and chile is good, and we said yes and then she asked how the situation is overall, then she looked into our classroom with the beer cans of other guys in and she said i suppose the situation is good ! pretty funny...later that day i got pissed at denise, which was mainly because... i don't even know exactly mainly because they refused to sit around with us ! but that was cleared later on !  at 2:00 in the morning today i had to get up, because my brother travelled to america (salinas near san francisco) and my father drove him there and he asked if i'd like to go to hungary with him (he works as a teacher and worked here for about 9 years and now he'll return to graz and this will be the last time for me to come here) and i slept nearly the entire drive ! so now we arrived here and my father sorted out clothing he'll give away and stuff he'll keep, which brought me some cool vintage jeans ! phew, just checked the cinema program and i'll probably go see 'secret window' tonight, though i can imagine how it will end !  best part of the travel was to drive on the 'autobahn' (similar to the highway) without any car on the road, the lights on the road flashing and passing by within one look and interpol is providing the soundtrack for you (and only for you at this moment) through headphones

       listening to: alkaline trio - queen of pain  it is 13:10 now and because i was bored i decided to visit my blog once more. school slavery reached a new level as we were 'forced' to paint our classroom which was pretty boring considering you didn't have much creative freedom ! my suggestion to paint it all black with a red door was appreciated much, we certainly would have come to write great but depressed thing in favor of kafka or nick cave..or radiohead ! so today there will be a school ending party, but i'll probably only go there to meet my friends as itwon't provide much entertainment ! all for now, cheers, thomas

      so...after starting to read tons of articles about blogs and live journals etc., i decided to start up my own blog just to try it out ! i'll probably not post on a regular basis (if anyone apart from me actually reads this pile of mental waste) but yeah it's just for fun, maybe it will have some sorts of therapeutical effects on me ! anyway, today was a pretty crappy day, i didn't get much sleep because i visited my friend chris(tian) yesterday and we watched stephen king's 'it' which i found unbelievably creepy as a kid, and now rather funny ! but this is definitely one of tim curry's best performances ! later we started to watch 'the big lebowski' but i started to fall asleep and called my dad if he would be able to pick  me up...well so i got to school five minutes to late and i greated a new guy to our class, his name's mohammad and he's from benin,africa ! his native language is french but he speaks german, though i didn't speak to him much ! later we had a huge debate on wether to travel to chile next year or to travel through poland and the czech republic ! the rest of the day was pretty boring but i'll continue bragging about it ! i sat around all day and read about three chapters of michael moore's 'dude where's my country' (-> 'volle deckung, mr.bush' in german), a the current x-men comic book and the first ever spider-man comic book (i loved comic books ever since i was a little child and my godfather gudrun brought that 'habit' of mine up again and so i got pretty hooked !) later she visited me, after that i played guitar, i learned interpol's 'roland' and iggy pop's 'the passenger' and after that i wanted to go back to reading but fought with sleep and drank an espresso, but after that i fell asleep anyway and woke up to a movie where a cop said "his dick's even bigger than mine" to a transvestite...strange...later a friend, denise, rang me up and asked if i had her special compilation ready and naturally i was able to answer this question with yes ! so we met, and went on for a walk and chatted about sveral things, our days, the last three days (we went camping with others at the röcksee), rain etc. then i read an article over at the fm4 (austrian radio station, very cool, features streaming in case of interest) homepage that included blogging and then i clicked around and landed here ! so as my  interest/blogging/writing abilities continue i'll post more and better written and include photos from my beloved digicam ! cheers, thomas
