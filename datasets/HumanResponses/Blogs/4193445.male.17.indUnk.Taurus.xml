      Dear Megan and Kerry:  You were right to assume that I am a kickass person.  All your tail-wagging, begging to be touched by my graceful hands and general brown nosing were worth it, just because my species is that much cooler than yours.  I also appreciate all the times you scared the shit out of Chris Park when he came over, which I look back on fondly as one of our most enjoyable experiences togethor.  I have not forgotten this and all your other noble actions.  Still, I need to inform you that I am not God.  However much you bark at, nuzzle, or try to hump my leg, I will not be able to make the storm stop.  I know that you believe I have a mystical power to make sunny days and lush green lawns for you to leave piles of shit on; in fact I am just opening the side door, and cannot control what's on the other side.  Any I only do it because I you shed everywhere when I let you inside.  I would further like to inform you that I have pursued extensive theological research, and studied many texts.  To my knowledge there never has been 'nor wil there ever be any diety that stops rain and thunder in exchange for the saccrafice of a dead squirrel on my door step.  I know you bark and whimper because the thunder scares you, and I sympathize, but it's fucking annoying.  Love, Andrew  *nb: Some people will find this funny.  They are stupid.  It it stilted and cliched.  While I just wrote it and am fairly certain it's not has not become a quasi-amusing mass email people like my mom circulate (yet), it's forced irony screams that it could soon be.  I also might have ripped off someone else's bad jokes.  In any event, it is the textual equivalent of Jay Leno and Bill Engevall.  And no, those people are not funny.  This was a cathartic exercise for myself, and you are strongly cautioned against any other use of it.  It is ok to occasionally vent all the pent up cliched irony in you, just like it's ok to masturbate.  Just think about whether you would send the results of either to your friends.

      Hard to talk about potential futures that sound silly if they don't happen.  But I'll try - for the above I mean.  Any event, it's why, and bye.  Otherwise... well, it's all above just the later.  I know this is cryptic.  I think I can explain it whatever happens.

      Today's news: you losers gayed up our govenor while I was gone.  I guess that's yesterday's news.  I'm not gone anymore, I expect the state to start getting straighter immediatly (as a result of my having gayly run away from hurricane Charlie.)  To save a lot of typing:                                            1. Euro                                            2. Brit. Lit.                                            3. Art. Hist.                                            4. Latin                                            5. Gym                                            6. Chem.                                            7. Eng.                                            8. Music  And here's to my utter lack of any mathmatical acumen!  I'm in to good a mood about being home to really talk, but I'm sure issues 'll come to my mind presently - late night I mean.  Well, I've got about 5 000 more pages to read before school starts, so peace out (later aligatorz!)

      My Grandparents fled the beach today, on the heels of tornado warnings. Just packed up and left. Wish I could do that sometimes, most times.  See I'm feeling so bad about hating all these people. So high and low. I mean, they're objectively horrible. They have these twisted values, sometimes make racist comments, but somehow I think I'm more offended by their general lack of taste. I really wish I could get up more righteous indignation about even the whole meat thing, when what really pisses me off is that they listen to bad music, and tell bad jokes, and spend their days playing stupid card games I can't beat them at.  Maybe ultimately it's their rejection of my culture, which is crass and pert in an old people sort of way, even if I should brush it off condescendingly. I can understand if people don't want to watch PBS documentaries, but using your grandparental authority to order that Fear Factor be shown on one of the beach house's six TVs is a little base. To be fair this is a general anger about general things - parents, uncles are doing as much, in different ways, these are hypothetical examples of how I feel. This didn't even happen... but it feels like it did.

      Surf lessons today - verdict? I might as well have sat in the kitchen and drank salt water for two hours, whilst eunuchs scrubbed me with sand paper and laughed at my girlish pale physique... sigh. I know Cappo was bummed some other guy (a big, hot guy no doubt) taught liz, maybe he could help me; it's not quite the same sure, but it could be like male bonding. I can hear a (FAKE) Texan drawl about my gayness already.  In other news, I was getting all paranoid about being talked about behind my back with Gorny and god knows who, so I tried to retaliate, to no avail. I was like "My friend Erin knows that I don't know your name." and my cousin was like "What the hell are you talking about?" and I was all like (stares at feet and mumbles). Hell yeah I'm gangsta... peace out.

      Dear god, it's me, Margret.  I could mean this if I believed my name was Margret, or I believed the internet was a god.  In a way though, I do, because if I pray here for something it could happen.  Consider all the weirdos out surfing the internet now who will probably one day go on a killing spree just for fun.  Could I not politely ask one of them to direct the products of their having been molested by their fathers at people who happen to legitimately annoy me?  I mean just sort of randomly blog: "gee, I wish Lauren would come down with cancer" and perhaps someone who needed someone to kill would take this oppurtunity?  I don't know if this is morally wrong... I mean if you have this serial killer who's going to kill somebody, and you happen to know somebody who's (in your judgement) marginally more grating than the average human being, wouldn't having your buddy killed have a statistical probability of sparing the better person?  Hmm, this is all rather bad for my whole vegi-pasivism brain and all, so I have to stop thinking about killing people.  But for the more perceptive of my readers, we all know it just means it's that time again... no I'm not pmsing you sexually frustrated ^$#&#(*s! (I don't know why I dont want to type fuckers... but there)  Anyway, it's the annual family vacation... oh and a great one at that, the stories I have... but, real information is so... well adjusted.  And this isn't.  Anyway, I'm in the Outer Banks, and on aim with my 56ks of fun occasionally, so shoot a line.  I feel so sad and neglected.  Thus began my blog.  Did I forget my introductions?
