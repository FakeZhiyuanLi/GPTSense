      So Beth said I should blog 'bout moving down here. Down here is Memphis. I'm from Illinois. They call it the mid-south, but it sure seems south to me. I went to see Steve Earle the other day (http://steveearle.com/) and he was booed [boo'd?] when he said that the civil war was fought over slavery and not state's rights. Really. Who booes [boo's] a pretty well informed entertainer whom you have just slapped $30 down to see over what most historians on the subject would agree is a pretty accurate statement (slave driven economy and all)? Southerners, that's who. Don't tell me this is the mid-south, its not. Its the damn south. Deal with it.   Anyway. Moved down here. It is kinda strange. Not always like you would expect. I'm not going to be trying to define the new south or the new, new south or the whatever. I'm just giving myself an outlet to write about what makes down here different in my view and how it effects my perspective.   I guess I'm getting a late start on it, but now is better than tomorrw, right?

      Not really. Friday we were meeting with the vet. He said (among other things) winters here are terrible because on one day it may be 78 degrees and on the next it can be 20 (he actually gave dates and examples, so this rates only just above "hmmm" on the hyperbolie scale). Sounds better than Illinois where it is 20 and 20 and 20 and 21 for the month of January.

      So my truck is acting up a little. Specifically, the intake to my catlytic converter has a crack in it. The pipe is holding on with just an inch or two of the three inch pipe still connected. So yesterday when Dewey Day (more about the neighbors later) came over to inspect my fence. I asked him if he knew of any mechanics in town who could help.   Now Dewey is a southern man down to his core. I'm only using his real name because, well, isn't it just cool as can be? Anyway, Mr. Day has retired from a career in auto-body work and I thought he might know some mechanics. Well, true to his profession he recommended I put bondo on it.   I didn't know exactly what he meant at first as bondo sounded more like funion than anything. As he said it more and more it started to sound like fundo and there - right there - is where I made the connection. Which brings me to an observation.   Everyone here likes to do things well enough to work, but not right. Tennessee has clean air regulations and as such requires inspections when an automobile is registered with the state. (And it's about time as Smokey mountain national park is one of teh most poluted places in America.) Anyway, they do emissions testing and, I'm told, take a good look at the underside of your vehicle to make sure everything is on the up and up.   Now Mr. Day knows this. I mention it to him again. He asks if the car sounds funny (it does, as cars with holes in their exhaust are wont to do), but is more concerned with appearance. He then proceeds to explain to me, in detail, how I could spend about the rest of my life working on this one hole with some bundo and some sand paper so that I could deceive the inspectors.   I'm pretty sure that it never crossed his mind to send me to a mechanic.  Now, I know I'm new, but this seems like a cultural thing to me. Everyone operates like that down here. The house we bought is full of that kind of little stuff from the painting to the electrical to the plumbing (oh, was that fun). The city recycling program is like that; it takes the bare essentials - newspaper, glass, and tin cans - but nothing (and I mean nothing) else. The parks, the roads, the lawns, the cars, the resturaunts, ad infinitum.   This more than anything, will be the death of me here.
