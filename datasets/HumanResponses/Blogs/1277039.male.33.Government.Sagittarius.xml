      Well Folks , I have had a little problem with this blog not wanting to post , so I had to delete it and start all over. A few of my posts got lost and the rest never got published. I plan on regularly blogging again. I need to keep * BF * informed since this is her last Day!     BF -Obviously not her real name --changed to protect the   GUILTY  !  I sure am gonna miss those 25 minute breaks! ( since I am a government worker I will still take those 25 minutes... now just by  myself ! )  I think I should just  say goodluck and congrats  to , BF, you got the hell out of  COUNTY - and you've done your time. Don't look back, otherwise you might turn into a pillar of salt.  As to complaining today--well wouldn't you know today has been kinda slow, so there has been no need to get angry at anyone. Although a nice, older lawyer needed me to show him how to use the mouse on a computer like 24 times and yet he still does not quite have it down. He was born before TV, so I  guess I won't hold it against him. Next, I got yelled at by a women who insisted that I sold her the wrong forms and then proceeded to bring me up the exact same forms to buy again. It might've helped her cause if she hadn't needed her 12 year old daughter to make all of the decisions for this family. This kid acted more like an adult than her mom. Dressed in a pink power suit ,   Powder-Puff-Teen  -  Attorney-Action-Girl  , proceeded to read all the fine print in the Self Service Center Guides and then point out how retarded  her   MOM  is.  Now For your Daily Counts:    number of hotchicks..............................................................................9    number of hot chicks under 18 seeking child support...........1    number of people asking whether I am a notary or not........2    number of crossed eyed people encountered at court........................1

      . Wednesday, March 05, 2003       It's 4:35 and I should probably be working or something, luckily no need as of yet. It's finally kinda quiet. Nothing to incredible happened today.  Let's  just say no one has really pissed me off or anything. I hand out divorce forms all day, so I meet the nicest people having the worst fucking day of their life.      People sure are jerks, always demanding ..."I know your not allowed to give legal advice,but...?    " Your gonna go ahead and ask anyway aren't ya buddy.  This is not the DMV, I do not provide answers,  get a friggin lawyer you cheap ass.  The only people who make it in to this place seem to be retarded, insane or both.     Just yesterday I overheard a some FAt middle-aged woman talking on her phone " I should go tell them " (she's talking about a co-worker of mine) "that I have been diagnosed with Multiple Personality Disorder, that's why I can't remember instructions."  I guess one of her personalities forgot to tell the other, because she never made it over to tell us.     Ahh shit... Thursday is free LAWYER day.   A civil servants idea of hell.  Satre wasn't kidding --hell  IS  other people!

       Me: Sir, you have to read the packets.         "I don't have time to read"        Good thing your in a library then, buddy. I think you have made the right choice about not reading. It's not like your were gonna understand anything. Just buy all the packets that could possibly pertain to you.  Ok, I'll try be  nicer , if you try being  smarter!     Daily counts:       2 cross-eye's       7 babes      1 underage teen seeking child support

       First, let me tell you ,  there   is  something  strange  about cross-eyed people. I am as liberal as they get , so I feel bad about spreading a stereotype. But honestly folks , they are kinda creepy, also a bit crazy. Point in case, they ask for  large quantities   of rubberbands . They return repetitively, acting as if their very lives depend on obtaining rubberbands. Family members scream for their attention, "  for god's sake   I'm trying to get rubberbands. Let me concentrate on one thing at time."    I mean for GOD'S sake people, leave her alone. Can't they see she's doing something important?  For the love of god , she needs rubberbands.  Don't worry, I have plenty of   rubberbands  for all of you!      I don't like to pick on people with physical deformities, but the court seems to get more than it's fair share of visitors from the evolutionary scrap pile. I'll just mention in passing that the guy's arm looked like it went through a blender from wrist to his elbow.      I am sitting behind a desk.   I am working on a computer.   I am wearing a name tag- court ID.   I am handing out forms or money.      What makes this person ask  " do you work here?"

        I never did get around to posting for Monday afternoon. I nearly had to come to blows with a guy who wanted a refund for 90 cents from a copy card purchase. "well there's no sign that says I can't get a refund"  -- Thanks asswipe. Once you buy the card it's yours to keep. Why the hell would you buy a card if you only needed one copy? Why would you argue for 11 minutes for 90 cents?      Biatch alert -- BF thinks 90 cents is worth arguing about.    Later that day, a wonderful encounter with a scab picking pyscho. Scab Picker insisted that he needed to get his guns back. You see, he was arrested for  Domestic Violence  and that damn bitch of a girlfriend of his had the nerve to ask the judge to take his gun away. "  just cuz   he had one. " This was very unfortunate, as it led him in maniacal fashion to pick continuously at his open wounds.      DAILY COUNTS:       babe count at zero    Five  " are you a notary?"  inquiries    one cross-eyed freak

       Well it's Monday. My mood? I am annoyed and angry. Why? Somebody had the nerve to try and make me feel guilty regarding my customer service skills. He could not not figure out how to get to a location here in the court by the directions I was giving him. He kept insisting he had never been here before; therefore , I suppose he is no longer familiar with concepts like north and south. Pointing and gesticulating were of no help either. " oh, but sir...I am not sure where North is." So my hand pointing you in that direction was not enuff huh?  It amazes me that  Creationists can insist we do not come from monkeys, when  there exists so much evidence to the contrary.      Have I mentioned that it's 11:35 (am) and not one single BAbe Count has been registered.  Disaster of a DAY.  More later perhaps.
