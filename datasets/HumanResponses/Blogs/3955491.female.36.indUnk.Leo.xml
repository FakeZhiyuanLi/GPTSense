      Okay so i had to stop last night because it was getting late and things just kept flooding my memory.I told you about my brothers dad.By the way he was a very young guy when he got together with my mom,he told her he was out of school,but he failed to say it was junior high school untill she came up pregnant.Back to where i ended.He never touched any of us in a wrong way other than that strange need to ask me for permission to have sex with my mom.they lasted about 6 years i think,or at least i think i was six.Things get fuzzy trying to remember how long they were together.Anyways,she finally caught him cheating on her and kicked him out of the house,which broke my heart because as i said,he had been a good dad to us all.He left and took my brothers with him and my mom ended up with a professional bowler named andy who disliked kids so she sent us to live with my real dads parents.My grandfather was an alcoholic and my grandma was just mean.That lasted a few months and she came to get us,she got my brothers and we were all together again and living with an aunt and uncle.Before too long the happiness did not last.I noticed changes in my mom,like violence towards us,me mainly because i was the oldest and was to keep an eye out on my siblings.She even busted my nose with a hot wheels raceing track one day cause i wanted a drink of water.We could feel the tension everyday when we woke up.It was just there.Then came the day when a lady came to see us,she told us our mommmy was sick and needed to go to the hospital and would we go with her for a bit untill she got out.We of course agreed thinking that it would not be long.We were put into foster homes,seperated,my brothers went to one and us to another(me and my sister)but eventually we were all put back together.We were there for over a year.my real dad wanted to give us up for adoption to these people and that broke my heart because he had not even seen us in years and he was so willing to give us up.Eventually my mom got better(or so they said)and came and got us.We moved back to L.A and things seemed to be going well.My mom had a new boyfriend who was good to us and so were his parents.He was a chef so some of my favorite memories are of sundays with him,he always cooked a big meal on sundays and it was things we never tried,stuffed mushrooms and baked alaska,he was wonderful.But of course fate has a way of slapping ya down and he was caught cheating on my mom after about 2 or 3 years together and the girl(who is now my aunt,she is my stepdads sister)came up pregnant.ahhh but back to when he was with us.my mom started this pattern of hysteria where we could not say or do anything lest she have another breakdown and we get sent off again.My brothers dad started coming around to see them and us and we started spending time over at his and his new girlfriends house.She had kids who were gang bangers and in the begining they were very nice to us.But as time went by things started going wrong.They started hitting us and making us drink and fight one another,and were not allowed to stop untill one of us fell unconcious from too much drink or someone lost a tooth.And when we were bad or did not comply we were put into the dryer and it was turned on.And things still got worse,i remember them taking my sister into the garage,where the son stayed and he had a friend in there with him,and they raped my sister.I could hear her screaming and i could not help her.The same as when i walked in and saw the boy making my youngest&nbsp; brother give him a blow job.You may wonder why we never said anything and it is because we did not want our mom going nuts anf losing her,plus noone ever believed us,we went to my brothers dad several times but he thought we were making it up..........to be continued again so i can catch my breathe and not cry so much.

       Okay,as i said i would eventually start from the begining.This is turning out harder though than i thought it would.I guess i could start with the standard&nbsp;I was born.When i was born&nbsp; my parents were traveling with the carnival and we traveled with them until i was close to 3.I have vague memories of this,i mainly remember a woman takin care of me alot.Well that and my dad hitting my mom and the other carnies taking up for her.My mom was 16 when i was born and had married my dad when she was 15.she did this to escape from her own father who had molested and dragged her around while he did whatever.My moms mom died when she was 14 and i am finding out lately that my moms mom was not what i had always pictured her to be in my mind.In my mind she was just a tired,always pregnant woman with bad health.I am finding out lately that she was just the opposite.She was mean and uncaring to my mom and her brothers and sisters.Anyways its not really about her,but in some ways it is because this was how my mom was shaped as she grew up.And later these were some of the only&nbsp; things she(my mom)&nbsp;could look back on to raise us up.and maybe luckily she died when she did because maybe things would have been far worse than they had for me and my sister and my brothers growing up.By the way did i mention i think my mom also has bpd?well i think she does.ok back to where i started before i derailed with details.My mom and dad fought alot,mostly my dad beating my mom and finally one day she hit him on the head with a skillet and took us away.I can still remember him pounding on my moms friends door and my moms friend telling him she had a gun and would use it if he did not leave.He left,not to resurface again when i was 12.actually i think we may have seen him twice in all those years,but for like a whole 5 minutes(10 if we were lucky)and he seemed disinterested in us,my sister and I.My mom soon met up with my Brothers dad(I have 2) and they were together for quite sometime,well long enough for them to have the boys and raise us for a bit.He was very good to us except he had one very bad habit,and that was to wake me up,he would be stark naked and ask me permission to go have sex with my mom,to which all i could reply not understanding was yes.....to be continued    &nbsp;

      Well my first time for doing any of this.I used to journal on my puter,but there is only so much space for holding it all.Its been a long day so far and we are barely finishing lunch hour and i am at the point all i wanna do is curl up and forget i or anybody or anything exists.I hate this life.sooo many things and almost every day turns into what the fuck now.I know i should be glad for alot of things,new grandbaby,joboffer,but there so much shit that goes on in the interim that it just breaks what little bit of happiness i get.I am so sick of hearing*get over it* or *it will get better*i will scream if i gotta hear that one more time.I feel like i am always bein punished for something,yes i do alot of self punishing,but still why must i be punished if i have not committed any real crime.The self punishment is my own doing yes.But the other that i feel is like so unjustified.I guess i will eventually go into my background ,my history,how i grew up(or didn't) so maybe there is some modicum of understanding for anyone who reads this(prolly make ya say no wonder she is bpd).For now though this is just my begining to start my blog,untill i feel more comfortable in doing this and posting it. &nbsp;

      Ok so it takes me awhile before i make new posts,but like i said in the begining this is hard for me because i have to relive bits of it when i remember.Ok so where was i,oh yes.We could not tell anyone because A.noone believed us and B.we were afraid of losing our mom again,and that was hard enough on us the first time.these people that we stayed with as i said were cruel beyond cruel,andf we spent so much time with them,at least a couple of years off and on.My mom became a dancer after her boyfriend scott(the chef)left her and we moved to hollywood.that seem to go well at least for a bit,Then my Grandfather showed up out of the blue and my mom sent us to live with him and my aunt in amarillo texas,he had a friend that came with him named richard(Richard is dead now)anyways i should have known something was up when my grandfather was taking a *nap* in the back seat with my sister and i heard this strange groaning and giggling coming from her,i think i was 9.Anyways other than that the trip was pretty uneventful other than that and e made it to texas.We got there and i was so glad to see my aunt whom i had not seen since i was a little girl of about 4 or 5.She had a little boy and they live in a small 1 bedroom apt.The little boy kept calling my grandfather daddy and i could not understand that,but i figured that maybe thats what he always heard my aunt call him so that how he picked that up,they were also sharing the bedroom,but again i thjought it was because the apt was so small.Later that night my granfather woke me up and asked me if i wanted to go get a piece of pie at the truck stop(my grandfather was a truck driver at the time)so like any kid i said yes.We went we had pie and he visited with his friends.Trouble started on the way home as he put me on his lap so i could steer the car.He then started fondling me and i would let go of the wheel to which he would accelerate and tell me to steer or we would crash and die,i was terrified of both things but the dying part scared me more so i steered and he molested me most of the way home.When we reached home he took out some money from his pocket,threw it in the mud and told me to tell my aunt that i found it,and so the molesting and eventual rapes began.I found out that my aunts son was fathered by my grandfather and that he had her so brainwashed&nbsp; that she could go nowhere.He moved us out into the country ,he did that alot so as to keep us away from real people and he continued to have us all,my aunt came up pregnant again with her second child(she had 3 in all by him)and thats the way it was for quite awhile.One night my grandfather was working on his car and needed a flashlight,my aunt gave it to me and told me to take it to him and i said no,she told me several times to and i still refused.I will never forget the look that came into her eyes,like a light went off,as she realized why.She then began asking me if he had been touching me and i told her everything,including how he made me watch him fuck her on the floor of the living room after he had given her some medicine in her soda pop.So she came up with a plan,the plan was she was going to act like she hated us and tell him she would leave if he did not get us out of her house,so he took us.She had no idea what the trip would come to as we left,it was the worst trip we ever had,nothing but raping us and making us drink in the heat the whole way,the trip which should have taken about 18 hours took 3 days,first the car broke down then he just spent the extra time doind hat he wanted with us.We made it back to my mom,and we could not really tell her for once again the fear came that she would leave us...Again i will have to continue later as this is sooo draining for me,believe me this is nowhere near the end.
