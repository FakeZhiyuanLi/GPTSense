      I am single.  Let's get that out of the way.  Alleah's now angry at me for asking the girls to convince her to break up with me.  I'll admit that that was low, and cowardly.  I did it only to prevent Alleah's wrath from being unleashed upon me.  Unfortunately, it backfired when the girls told her about said plan.  I was trying to get some kind of neutrality about the whole thing, but it appears I misjudged the girls' inability to keep secrets from each other.  But, is it the right thing to tell one a secret involving them when it only causes everyone involved harm?  I think not, but...whatever.      In other news, Drew's starting a new band, called Chasing Chester.  It seems the current line-up is him on vocals, someone named Spencer on bass (Schachtel?), and no word yet on a drummer, but Nolan has apparantely volunteered or has been asked.  Who knows how far this thing will go, but I'm looking forward to the results.  And shazbot to all you who think Drew will just flake and be a jerk, because he's a nice guy.  You all are living in the past.  You know who you are.       So, I'm lonely and tired, and going to the Comox Folkfest tomorrow.  Naramata is in a week.  I'm stoked for everything.  Everything except being lonely and tired.  Perhaps I'll put up a personal next time I blog...not that I'm...pathetic or anything...yeah.  I can't fool them.  Well, you know what?  You..y-you're crazy, aren't you?  Ha..ha, y-yes, you're certifiably insane!  Gastrointestinal cancer with a side of genital warts!  This is the Rather Insane Dark Horse, signing off.

      My father phoned this morning, and said the family was probably coming home tomorrow.&nbsp; Noooooooo!&nbsp; They were supposed to be gone until Saturday or Sunday!&nbsp; Monkey must be missing his computer and his girlfriend.&nbsp; Boo on Monkey.&nbsp; I just beat Metal Gear Solid, but my game froze, and I couldn't save it!&nbsp; I don't remember where I saved last.&nbsp; Probably a long time ago.&nbsp; Sux0r.&nbsp; Anyway.&nbsp; I still haven't finished my paper on the TBoLaD, but I've got until&nbsp;August 8th, and then the 14th til the 22nd to finish (Naramata, no computers there.)&nbsp; 12 days until Naramata, btw.&nbsp; To bad Brianna can't go...but Laura is, so at least I can show someone the awesemity that is Naramata.&nbsp; I wonder who we'll attach ourselves to this year?&nbsp; Beth and her troupe?&nbsp; Lloweyn, and Karen, the couple who aren't *actually* a couple, but really should be.&nbsp; They're just so perfect for each other, but I guess they don't want to risk a relationship for fear of messing up the friendship, besides the fact that she lives in Okotoks, Alberta, while he lives in Van (that's Vancouver, BC, for anyone reading who doesn't live on the West Coast of Canada, as if anyone reads this but my friends).&nbsp; Or perhaps the random group of whoever from wherever that I hooked up with three or four years ago, and still see around Naramata.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; The only guarantee is fun.&nbsp; I really need to do more job-hunting.&nbsp; I need to check back at the places I've already been.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; I'll find a job sooner or later.&nbsp; I hope.&nbsp; Well, this is the Tired Dark Horse, signing off.

       I demand that the author of Konsekai: Swordwaltzer draw faster!!&nbsp; I love that comic, but the site got hacked at the beginning of June, and he's updated the comic once since.&nbsp; It sucks.&nbsp; Anyways, here in Nanaimo, we're having ourselves a heatwave.&nbsp; It's fucking hot.&nbsp; I'm going to strip nude and sit outside under the sprinklers.&nbsp; But then, you'd like that, wouldn't you?&nbsp; So I won't.&nbsp; I'll just take the dog for a walk and get even sweatier.&nbsp; Haha...so tired...heat must be getting to me.&nbsp; It's baking my brain.&nbsp; I need to finish my presentation for the Symposium.&nbsp; It's on the Tibetan Book of Living and Dying by Sogyal Rinpoche.&nbsp; I don't really have alot to say.&nbsp; Road trip tomorrow, it'll be more interesting than stuff here.

      I've become totally obsessed with watching Hellsing on Web TV.&nbsp; It's an anime series set in Britain&nbsp;about a vampire called Alucard (or Arucard, depending on whether it's the show...or the credits.), who works for the Hellsing organization for unknown reasons.&nbsp; The Hellsing organization is a black ops force of 'Religious Knights', trained to killed vampires.&nbsp; It is led by Sir Integra(l) Wingates Hellsing, daughter of the founder, I believe.&nbsp; In the first episode, a vampire masquerades as a preist and kills a police unit&nbsp;and almost decimates a D-11 force, one of the members of which is Seras Victoria, or "Police Girl".&nbsp; She is captured by the vampire, and Alucard has to shoot through her to hit the vampire in the heart with his holy high caliber pistol.&nbsp; So, he drinks Seras' blood, making her his servant, but saving her life...in a way.&nbsp; She is now a vampire, and works for the Hellsing organization as Alucard's servant, and of course, using her&nbsp;Mad Vampire strength and skill to put the human members of Hellsing to shame...and so, they battle the forces of&nbsp;evil&nbsp;every episode, and I enjoy it immensely.&nbsp; I know, I'm a nerd, but I looooooooove Hellsing.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's my little spiel, because I love anime.&nbsp; I apologize to everyone who might think I'm wasting my time watching animes about vampires in Britain, where everyone coincidentally speaks Japanese.&nbsp; It's just so awesome.&nbsp; Alucard has the ability to become some kind of Hellhound to defeat the more powerful of his enemies, and wields large&nbsp;dual handguns, loaded with bullets made from melted crosses, which somehow kills vampires.&nbsp; Maybe they were silver crosses.&nbsp; Silver kills vamps, right?&nbsp; I know this is all very pointless, but I feel the need to rant about awesome things I come across.&nbsp; Also, Walter, the butler, is also known as the 'Angel of Death', and has the ability to spin threads from his fingers&nbsp;which can cut right through flesh and bone!&nbsp; Isn't that the coolest thing ever?&nbsp; Not to mention the gigantic gun that Seras recieves, which uses some kind of artillery shell, not kidding.&nbsp; And of course, she can wield it, even though it must weigh 50 kgs, not including the shell, because of her ultra vampire strength.&nbsp; So cool. &nbsp;&nbsp; I've probably bored you all enough.&nbsp; I'll slink into the shadows and watch my vampire anime.&nbsp; Peace out, this is the Dark Horse, signing off.

      My family is going away!!&nbsp; Mom, dad and Monkey (my little bro, Mike, for those unfamiliar) are going camping til Wednesday, then going out on the boat for another week and a half.&nbsp; O, sweet deliverance!&nbsp; It's going to be great.&nbsp; I don't even know what to do with all the free time I'll have!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, all is not well.&nbsp; If you've read Alleah's blog lately, you know that she and I got into a little tussle about maturity.&nbsp; I was a little upset at some of the things she said about me.&nbsp; I'm not really not going to get into that, because I'd rather it be between me and her, not broadcast over the entire internet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Thursday, I got to go with Kevin to Tai Chi, and watch&nbsp;ten old people, and two young ones, do Tai Chi for two hours.&nbsp; Kevin, and his friend, Zed (neither Kevin nor he told his real name, unless Zed is his real name)&nbsp; were the only ones there under 35, I swear.&nbsp; Well, maybe one other woman who didn't look too too old.&nbsp; Anyway.&nbsp; It was interesting to watch, but I don't know whether I want to get into that, or back into Aikido.&nbsp; I really don't know what to talk about.&nbsp; I guess that's it right now.&nbsp; This is the&nbsp;Bored Dark&nbsp;Horse, signing off.

      ok, ok.&nbsp; I get the idea.&nbsp; I'll bow to the people's will, and give at least once a week, something about me, ok?&nbsp; This week, we'll reveal that I am, in fact, human.&nbsp; Thanks, that's your personal post.&nbsp; Check back next week to discover my gender!&nbsp; Ok...insufficient.&nbsp; I understand.&nbsp; So, me...what have you been up to lately?&nbsp; Well, I've been...going to driving school!&nbsp; And learning to drive!&nbsp; Took me long enough, eh?&nbsp; I'm 17 years old, graduated, no job, no driver's license.&nbsp; Good job.&nbsp; Soon, yes, soon I'll have my N, and I'll be free.&nbsp; The instructor for driving school was named Ian, and he was one of the funniest guys ever.&nbsp; I wish my high school teachers had been like him.&nbsp; He claims that all pedestrians are at least 50% insane, and totally insane and on copious amounts of crack if they wear hats.&nbsp; Also, every other road user is either driving with a big mac in one hand, a crackpipe in the other, and a cell phone wedged between their shoulder and head, or going 130 km/h doing everything but smoking crack.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because they need more crack.&nbsp; And we watched the videos, oh...the videos..."Why?&nbsp; Why not!", to quote Ian.&nbsp; Oh, good times.&nbsp; Anyway.&nbsp; I also had an interview at RMH, it looked as though they were going to hire me, but...their training schedule goes into Naramata, which I can't miss.&nbsp; UrGfH!&nbsp; Maybe, they'll have another training course after the 14th of August...probably not, knowing my luck.&nbsp; But my family is going away for two weeks!!!!&nbsp; Hahrahra!!!&nbsp; *rubs hands together in a mischevious fashion*&nbsp; Erin Windross is planning a road trip for Tuesday-Thursday.&nbsp; I don't know if that's going down, hopefully, it is. &nbsp; It'll be kick-ass.&nbsp; And apparently, there will be alchohol.&nbsp; I plan on participating.&nbsp; You heard me, I plan to PARTICIPATE!&nbsp; I'm graduated now, it's something I suppose I must experience.&nbsp; Alex said he wanted to see me drunk, so we shall see.&nbsp; So, I shall do that which I have boycotted, but not because I'm a hypocrite, you bastards!&nbsp; Because I'm going out with myyyyyyyyy fr-iends.&nbsp; So there.&nbsp; This is the Drunk-er, Dark Horse, signing off.

      A road stretches off into the distance.&nbsp; It is long and winding, and in place of the yellow stripes we are all familiar with, dotting the middle of the road are golden bars.&nbsp; The mark of an Officer in the US military.&nbsp; The caption beside the closest bar reads: 'This is the bar of a Second Lieutenant. You earn it by taking ROTC in college. It means Officer, a leader of the United States Army. If you can acheive it, people will follow you.' The yellow bar underlines the picture, reading 'AN ARMY OF ONE' I found this ad in a magazine.&nbsp; You could squeeze the page and it would ooze red, white and blue.&nbsp; Really, how many American boys are pulled in by this?&nbsp; We've gone back to 1914.&nbsp; 'The Grand Adventure, War.'&nbsp; The boys, hardly out of school, go off to fight in the great war for freedom and heroism.&nbsp; They don't think that, in a few day's time,&nbsp;they could&nbsp;be lying in a ditch, cold, dirty, bloodied, begging for their mother as their bowels empty themselves through their ruptured gut.&nbsp; Or that they might come home short a limb or two, or not come home at all.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's the same today.&nbsp; Young men enter military service not&nbsp;realizing that they are giving their lives into the hands of an armed force, that is in conflict with another armed force, one that isn't clearly distinguished and easily fought.&nbsp; One that set explosives in cars, buildings, and just about anything they can get at.&nbsp; That includes the boys.&nbsp; In fact, their favorite target is a young American boy wearing those nice desert camos and wielding an M-16 and infidel ideologies.&nbsp; It all seems so far away when you hear it on the news, or read it in the paper.&nbsp; 'Four American GI's killed in Baghdad bombing'.&nbsp; We hear it almost every day.&nbsp; I ask you, how many people do you know who are in the military?&nbsp; Alleah has a brother in the Marine Corps.&nbsp; Will he be going to war?&nbsp; I don't know, actually.&nbsp; I'll have to ask her next time I see her.&nbsp; What's the point, people?&nbsp; To protect liberty and freedom?&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; Just think about how liberating and freeing you'd feel pointing a deadly&nbsp;weapon at people who didn't know you, didn't speak your language, or understand why you were shooting at them.&nbsp; So just think twice before you listen to that man with the shaved head and the army greens, my neighbor Americans.&nbsp; Think before you kill.

      Well well well, my first weblog.&nbsp; How fun.&nbsp; So this is the place on the WWW where I get to rant and rave about the goings-on in my life, and everyone else's.&nbsp; Oh, we're going to have some fun with GWB and his Dick and...er, Colin.&nbsp; And I suppose I'll take some time (because that's what this is made for) to talk a little about my life as well...I suppose.&nbsp; Today's post will be mostly for introducing...none other than...the one and only...for one lifetime only...you know him....you love him...yes, it's time...ladies and gentlemen.........boys and girls....it's....the man himself...me.&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let down?&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; I'm not too exciting.&nbsp; I'm a hippy, an activist, anti-war, -bush, -corperations, etc etc.&nbsp; By the way...didn't the Iraqi government get handed over to the Iraqis...?&nbsp; So why are we still nosing into their business?&nbsp; They're now a sovereign nation again, why is America still around getting its boys killed?&nbsp; What really is the point of having American, and&nbsp;British boys over there being human bomb fodder, and not really doing anything but distracting the terrorists while the Iraqis try to solve their own problems?&nbsp; And now we have evidence that...oops, Iraq wasn't financing Al Qeida after all.&nbsp; It was the Saudis...hehe...whoopsie!&nbsp; Sorry, hundreds of Iraqi civilians who got caught in the crossfire!&nbsp; Oh well, one more dictator off the seat...but people of the world, who is it that's going to get invaded next?&nbsp; Is it the Saudis?&nbsp; No, of course not!&nbsp; Don't be silly!&nbsp; We're going after that crazy Asian Kim Jong-Il!&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because he doesn't have oil, just nukes!&nbsp; Well, George, we're all pulling for you...and by pulling for you, I mean we're trying desperately to pull you away from the big red button that you think is so shiny that you have to touch it.&nbsp; This is The Dark Horse, signing off.&nbsp; (Cheesy, but I like it, so... you know what...screw you.)

      Well, I'm back from Naramata, and it was great!  Got to see all of the gang again - Karen, Lloweyn, Beth, Christa, Megan, Rosey, Chris, Alan, Kyla, Angie, Scott, Patrick etc, etc.  And I also met some new people- Whitney, Riley, Hannah, Wavy (spelling?) and Ben.  We sang all kinds of awesome music.  Go gospel, African rounds and hymns.  I told everyone about my new love interest, of course.  I asked Spencer and Aden to go to Piper's with Nicole and I.  It ought to be fun.  And no, I'm not using Aden and Spencer to get to her.  I like those siblings.  They're highly entertaining, and getting out of the house is getting out of the house, and I might as well get as many people as is convenient out with me.  Although, I do admit, it is an opportunity to be out, with her.  I'm totally smitten.  She has the most wonderful smile, a great sense of humour, a beautiful face, and an amazing personality.  *sigh*  This is the Lovestruck Dark Horse, signing off.

      Well, isn't it just my luck that I find a great girl that I really want to get to know better, hit it off great, have great conversations with her, and then...have to go away for a week.  So, on Monday, I went to Rose's birthday party.  And when I was there, I met some great people from Arts Alive.  Some knew me from Music Man.  I remembered some of them, but didn't quite recall others.  That's besides the point.  There was one I knew I hadn't met before, and I knew right away that I wanted to get to know her.  Let's call her Jane.  She was, how you say, 'bubbly'.  She had that bright smile that just resonated happiness.  She had a great personality, and was energetic and bright, and I could see the intelligence in her eyes.  She was also at the Random Party at Laura's, and the jamming at Nolan's.  It was here that I simply couldn't keep my eyes off her.  She was beautiful, and the feelings I had were only encouraged by Mel's 'I could see that', and the conversation following our visit at Nolan's.  I also talked with her after M gave me her email address.  (If she happens to come upon this blog, then I'm so blown.)  We talked for quite a long time, and it was very nice.  I enjoyed talking with her.  I really want to get to know her alot better, and perhaps one day I can find the courage to ask her out.  I really have no idea if she feels at all the same as I do, but I would be thrilled to find out.  In other news, as I said, I'm going away for a week.  Naramata, in the Okanagan, right on the lake.  A singing camp organized by the United Church and Naramata Centre, called Music Week, but commonly referred to simply as Naramata.  We're taking Laura along with us, this will be her first Naramata.  Ought to be fun!  Anyway, that's enough for now.  This is the Excited Dark Horse, Signing off.

      well, I promised a personal.  Hey, why not, eh?  Well, I've never written a personal, so obviously I haven't a clue where to begin.  How about physical?  I'm a WAS.  White Anglo-Saxon.  Not Protestant, however.  Just under six foot, maybe 5'11".  Medium build, not alot of fat, but not exactly skinny, either.  Only very slightly muscular.  Not quite shoulder length dark brown hair, blue/grey eyes, sporadic full beard/goatee when I decide to shave (which is not often).  Usual dress includes jeans, occassionally shorts during the summer, sandals whenever possible, t-shirts, and corderuey jackets.  Always cord.  I don't wear any casual overcoat that isn't cord.  Including my new cord trenchcoat.  At the moment, I sometimes have a slight limp due to the three or four gashes in my left knee and shin.    That's physically me.  Now, how about personality?  Well, I like to think I'm a nice guy, but sometimes I sure don't feel like it.  That's why I'm writing this.  Besides that whole fiasco, I'm generally a great guy.  I'm about as thick as a rock,  like most guys, I'm oblivious.  But I'm sensitive and I actually listen when people talk to me.  I'm passionate about what matters to me, and I'm very understanding about what matters to others.  I'm not greedy or needy.  I like having space sometimes, but others I just need to be with someone.  I am constantly flirting, whether the person be female, or a theatre person.  I'm not gay or bisexual, but I think gays and bis should have their rights, and I'm cheering for the other side, even though I don't play on it, haha!  Anyway.  I am a Buddhist, and I'm very into the philosophy of it.  As such, I'd say I'm more tolerant than most people towards conflicting philosophies or religions.      In a girl, there are a few things I am looking for.  Basically, I'm looking for a soul I can bond with.  I'm in it for a good, solid relationship, one that's comfortable, and casual.  She has to be able to hold a conversation with me.  Looks don't hurt, but it's the personality I'm looking for.  In terms of looks, however, I'm not looking for someone who's anorexically skinny.  I'm a sucker for a pretty face, especially nice eyes.  Personality-wise, I'd like someone who shares some of my views.  An activist, who knows something about the world and cares about it, and isn't afraid to be different.  Someone like me, but not exactly.  I'm definitely not looking for high-maintenance or materialistic.  Someone spiritual and reflective that I can relate to and talk with.      Obviously, I like to have fun.  I like to go for walks in the Linley Valley, particularly Arbutus Bluff, where one can look down on Departure Bay and the surrounding area for kilometers.  I also like to just hang out with friends, you know, usual teenager stuff.  When I'm bored and alone, however, I like to head down and play some video games, preferably with someone else.  Yeah, I'm a gamer, and something of a consumer whore for it and I'm sorry.  I just like video games, what can I say?  Other than that, I listen to alot of music, and talk to friends.  I'm looking for a job, and I'm learning to drive, should have my N by the end of August, hopefully.      So, that's my personal.  If you fit me, and I fit you, and live in the area of Nanaimo BC, why don't you drop me a comment?  I'm not being desperate, I simply psychicly knew this was what you wanted.  Ahem...I guess this is just my way of giving you all a glimpse of me, I'm not really expecting anything out of it, but hey, you never know.  This is the Single Dark Horse, signing off.
