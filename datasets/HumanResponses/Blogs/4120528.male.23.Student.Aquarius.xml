      Well today has been another wonderful day of doing nothing but working and thinking. I get to think about alot of different things. One is where exactly I am going to be moving and what I am going to be doing while I am there. That and I will have to leave two good friends here one of which I care about. The other thing of work is about as fun as anything anymore. I go I work I leave its all good or to quote my friend misty "K Good". At least yesterday wasnt too bad. I was at my friend larry's house again to try and get the rest of the tree down. We got the two biggest sections down and it was scarry as shit being thirty feet in the air with a huge tree limbe that is about 25 feet long coming down at what looks like the neighbors house only to fall right in-between the two houses. I was sooooooo thankful for that one. Then when we limbed another one it was pulling my safety lines so that scared the crap out of me but when that was all done I had a really cool seat at about thirty feet a nice view of the valley and a good chance to watch the thunder clouds come roling in. Yea that wasnt fun. As soon as I heard a rumble I was like Yea IM done for today. I was on the ground in about 8 mins, usauall it took about 15. Once I was on the ground I was getting my stuff together and out in my car I walked over to see what else had to be done and not much else has to be done but while we where looking the big drops started to fall and we were like ok its time to go. All that night the biggest thing I wanted to do was take a shower but that didnt happen because it was thundering and lighting out and you are not suppose to do that because the lighting could come up through the water lines from the drainage. So I had to go out with out a shower and felt really gross. One a good night to that night I was able to talk to misty a little bit and that was good. I really enjoy talking to her. It seems wierd but it feels like all my other problems just fade away when I am talking to her but then again we talk about all our problems. So it is like mutual therapy. I just hope that I am helping her deal with her stuff as much as she is helping me with mine. I hope that things turn out good for her. She has had soo much bad stuff go on in her life that she deserves better. Well that is aboot all that is going on here. I will be going home for a few days. So I will probably posting again soon.

      Yea so I feel like crap today.  Yesterday I was out limbing a tree at Dr. Larry's house and one of the limbs desides to swing back and bite me right in the middle of my left thigh.  It didnt hurt much at the time.  But today it is as sore as hell.  So that sucks.  I have alot of mixed feeling right now.  Pretty much the only person I can talk to is having a really hard time dealing with a Ex.  While I am having simaliar problems.  Although I do have feelings for this person I cant come out and say it.  Either besauce I am affraid or I think that she doesnt need me adding to her pile of stuff going on.  Which she really doesnt need.  I thinkt that is more why I dont say anything becasue I dont want to add to what is going on.  I just wish I could help more.  She had a really bad day where the ex called and in a long form called her a whore.  Which is the farthest from the truth.  Sometimes I really dont understand how a guy can be such an asshole.  I know being a guy sometimes being an asshole is necisary but this time I really just want to punch this guy out and ask WTF was he thinking?  I dont know I think I need to do something or I am going to think about this too much today.

      Well a good bit has happenned since my last post.  Lets see Tuesday was the day that my family and I went out to New York to drop off our stuff at a cousins house then went right into the city to a viewing.  Which was the first time in a long time that I saw any family.  It was ok.  Not much can be said about a viewing.  Then on wendsday we had the funeral.  Yea that was a funeral and of course after the funeral was the burial.  I was amost shocked that I really didnt cry through the whole ordeal.  It wasnt until I got to the grave of my fathers parents that I really cried.  They passed away when I was only about 1.  I dont know maybe the idea that I never met them and that I lost what could have been there.  I dont know.  After that we all got back in the cars and went back to my cousins and packed to come home.       Thursday I drove back to my apt.  It was really freaking rainning so it was a little bit of a trek.  But I got home ok.  So I got home and make a desion to unblock leanne from my list.   Which soon got a response.  I told her to call me and talk.  I finally got to tell her that things where finally over between the two of us.  Surpriseingly she took it better then I could have hoped for.  It wasnt pretty but she took it better then I though.  We where on the phone for about an hour and a half.  She had to go due to haveing to drive for 8 hours the next day for New York.  I didnt hear anything from here till tonight which I though was a big surprise.  I figured she would have called before today.  She said that she wanted to talk more and I was just like, O god.  So I know that another call will happen shortly.  Then after we got off the phone feeling shitty and numb.  I left and went to talk to one of my really good friends.  That helped a good bit.  For some reason I feel better after talking to them.  So I left there fairly late.      Friday I had work and got back to the swing of things.  At least it was good to see some things will not change.  I got a good deal of stuff done and so on and so forth.  Friday was also the same night that two of my other friends were having a party.  So I had two parties to go and then I found out that my one friend had a really wierd/bad day.  So I went over there and talked with them till about 11:30.  From there I went out to the party at my friend/coworkers party.  It was interesting.  I got to follow/chase my one friend because he was a good bit inebriated.  So during the night I was drinking something called absinthe. Check here for more details on absinthe.   urlLink http://brewery.org/library/absfaq.html  Most of my friends didnt like it but I though it was pretty good.  While all of this is going on Kill Bill vol I and II are playing.  So that just adds to things.  So about 3:30am I decide to head out of the party due to most of the people are now asleep.  So I go to my other friends party.  It still had some people sturring around so it was cool.  I got to see my one friend nick  urlLink http://www.gliscameria.blogspot.com/  who is now living in Phoenix Arizona.  So that was really cool to see him again.  So what is he doing when I get there he is playing Madden 2005.  That was wierd but ok.  At one point all I see is a girl wareing nothing but a towel run by.  So that was cool.  aka She was HOT.  So I left there about 5 ish to head home.  The best part of all this is that I have work at 6:30 the next morning.  So I get about a 40 min nap before I have to be at work.      Saturday was like a wierd half lack of sleep induced dream.  I was really out of it for most of the day.  I actually found myself waking from falling alseep while standing.  That was trippy.  So when I got home I went to bed.  I was like ok I will set my alarm for about 7 pm (I went to bed around 4ish) so if I wanted to do something I could.  So yea that didnt happen. I got out of bed around 9 thinking it was like 9 am so I am like ok I have about an hour before I have to be at work.  So that is cool.  I go to put my head back down for about another 10 mins.  I then get up again.  Walk out into the kitchen and see it is still dark out.  Thinking god you are such a schmuck.  So I am up at 9 pm so what else is there to do I watch tv till about 1 then go to bed again.  So I can get up for work at 10 on Sunday morning.      Sunday was another day of work and then I come home and get a good hot shower and feel better.  I think I went out to visit my friend again to see how they where doing and to talk about things.  It went fairly well.  After which I cam home and went to bed for work at 12 monday morning was quickly going to approach.  That leads into today.       Monday which was today now yesterday.  I had work and that was work what else do I have to say.  I got home and then went out to shoot some pool with my other friend mike.  That was cool.  So here I am now home from shooting pool and hungry (I have ramen cooking.)  it is about 3 am and I have work tomarrow at 8 so I think I am about out of material to write about.  So g'night everyone.  I didnt get to see my other good friend but I will hopefully get to see them tomarrow.

      Well lets see saturday night I get a call from my rents telling me that my great grand mother has passed away.  To quote a good friend "K`good".  So for the last few days I have been in a wierd type of la la land mood.  I dont know how I really feel.  I have been out and about with a the few friends that I have.  I went out that night and played the best pool of my life.  After that I quit for the night.       The next day I was like a zombie.  I didnt know what I was doing I think I was just going through the motions.  This was sunday.  I got home and took a nap mostly because sleep is not coming easy nor has it ever.  After that I just stayed home.  Feeling numb.        Today was wierd I woke up not feeling like I slept a wink.  So I got up and tryed to check my email but my comp wont let me conect to the internet.  I get im but that is all.  So then I go and pack my stuff to come home.  I get in my car and go to cal. to deposit a check and see if misty is around.  Thank god she was.  If I didnt see her I would probably have gone nuts.       Misty is a whole nother story.  I can't start to say how much she has helped me these last few weeks.  There are other things but not for this posting.      So here I am at home with nothing going on but my mind at full throttle.  So I am typing things out to try and say something I dont know what but something.

      Ok, so   I just read an email from who I know consider the EX.  If you read the last one then you know that I havent talked to her in over a month.  Here she is emailling me with a question on weither she should change what county she is working in so we can find an apt together.  What the muthr F!!!  If you havent talked to someone in over a month wouldnt you get the hit that either they didnt want to talk to you or that things are over.  Well then again I know who I am talking about and it usual takes about me telling her something about Six or seven times to actually hear it, not understand it but hear it.  SO I am going to go out tonight and get some wings and shoots lots of pool.  I am really trying my hardest not to really get mad.  Casue you wouldnt like me when Im angry.   czech U l8r

      Well this has been a wierd few days.  I have been in a really wierd funk the last couple of weeks.  I have not talked to my technical girlfriend in over a month.  That relationship is going to end here really soon.  I recently recieved an email from her but as soon as I saw it I just got soo mad.  I know that I will have to talk to her soon mostly just to tell her that it is over for good.  But anyway before I want to put my fist through my monitor I am going to change the subject.  One a wierder side note.  I have been talking a friend of mine.  We have known each other for a while but we never really got to talk much until a couple of months ago.  More recently we have been hanging out a good bit.  I know that she is not ready for someone else but I just have this feeling about her.  In alot of different ways it feels like it did the first I really cared about someone.  The only problem is that she is still getting over a long relationship.  I know that it will take her some time to get over it.  Its the wierd part I know she needs time but I just feel so alone anymore.  The other really wierd thing is that I know "the talk" is going to be coming up soon.  The only thing I dont know is how she will take that.  Mostly I know that after that talk then most things get really wierd and out of control.  I really don't want to loose her friendship but I just don't know what is going to happen after that talk.  That is what I am mostly afraid of.  The only have two other things that are really going on.  One is work.  Work is always the same WORK.  The other thing that is going well is my Pool game.  I am really starting to get the hang of things but I still have alot to work on.  I am really enjoying playing now that I can actually win sometimes.  I have been trying to play agaianst alot of other people so I can test myself in differnt ways.  I just need to get out and keep practicing.  Well that is about all that I have to talk about today.  I just needed to get most of that off my chest.  Just keep checking in on this place to see how badly I f#*$ things up.
