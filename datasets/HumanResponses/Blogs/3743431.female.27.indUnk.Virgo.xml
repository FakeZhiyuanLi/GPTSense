      I have been a pretty unbiased person in regards to Michael Moore's latest film. I even gave it a half-assed positive review, although I was honest in reporting some inaccuracies that I found.  After visiting http://www.moorewatch.com after hearing about the website on the news, I decided to take a wander over there.   It seems the Michael Moore has taken an article about his film, posted it on his site, but removed a sentence or two from the article.  Below is what was written by JimK at Moorewatch.com:   urlLink Mikey Is Afraid of Us - MOOREWATCH - Watching Michael Moore's every move : "Case in point?  Just like we do here, Mike has been reposting articles on his website that pertain to F911.  On this page he reposts the entire text of a column from Canada's CTV News.  Here's the way Mike quotes it.   CTV.CA: Missing Fahrenheit 9/11's Forest for the Trees'  Bill Doskoch, CTV.ca News Staff  Updated: Wed. Jun. 30 2004 5:51 PM ET  Both the critics and the audiences have come out for Fahrenheit 9/11. Pulling in almost $22 million US in its first weekend, the film has set a record for a documentary.  Not surprisingly, the mainstream media has cast a skeptical eye on the left-leaning film. And U.S. conservatives are absolutely apoplectic about it.  Both the mainstream news media and conservative advocates have harped on inaccuracies in the film.  Now, here's the way it appeared on the CTV News website.  Missing Fahrenheit 9/11's forest for the trees  Bill Doskoch, CTV.ca News Staff  COMMENTARY&#65533;Both the critics and the audiences have come out for Fahrenheit 9/11. Pulling in almost $22 million US in its first weekend, the film has set a record for a documentary.  Not surprisingly, the mainstream media has cast a skeptical eye on the left-leaning film.

[Emphasis added]So, even in an article sympathetic to his cause and his message, he feels the need to delete the names of two websites.  As a writer, I am appalled. As a person, I am angry that someone would go to these lengths, as well as, deceive, in my opinion, people who believe in him and his ethics.

      The F word has become such a dirty word in our society. It is filled with stereotypes, derogatory remarks, and, in some cases, pure ignorance and hate. Now, I am not talking about THAT F word, I am talking about the word Feminist.  Does anyone actually know what a feminist is? Ask someone and their answers may include the term woman's libber, or a comment about burning bras, or even a comment questioning one's sexuality.  They may believe that being a feminist means you are anti-marriage or anti-name change after marriage. They may believe that being a feminist means that you are men haters or belong to a different era. To some, it means intimidation. To others, it means weakness.  I am a married woman, who took the last name of her husband, has three children, cooks dinner for her family, cooks for her family, and takes care of her family. I stay at home with my children, and for a time of four years, was always barefoot and pregnant. And I am a feminist.  Feminism is believing in social, political, and economical equality for all sexes. Many of you reading this are probably feminist without knowing it. Some of you may hold bad feelings towards feminist, but have wives that hold this belief.   Feminism is just another example of something positive that has been spun by the media to gain the negative stereotypes that it has.  So, the next time someone tells you that feminist hate men, ask them to name one. The next time someone tells you that feminist are the enemy of all women, ask them how, when all feminist really want is to be treated as an equal. You will be surprised at how many individuals will not be able to answer you back.  Be proud of being a woman. Be proud of being a feminist. Stand up for yourself and take back the dirty associations with the word, and show how it is a positive force striving for positive things. And raise your daughters to believe the same things.

      Did anyone catch the news blurps on Saddam in court today? What am I thinking? This is America! It was on every channel, every five minutes. Some emphasized his statement that President Bush was the real criminal, some minimized it, not wanting to give him the opportunity to allow anymore anti-bush 'propaganda' or because they are republican-based news sources and didn't want anyone to get wind of what he said, because some people might actually agree with him.  I have to admit to you all, if there even is an all, that the legal transfer of Saddam to the brand, spanking new Iraqi government makes me extremely apprehensive. I mean the Iraqi government had only been a 'newly sovereign' (as stated by one news source) country for a couple of days. And today with Iraqi guards escorting him into court? Can they be trusted? Is there some inside information on his where-a-bouts that extremist and loyalist could possibly hijack him?  Now, don't go accusing me of being pessimistic or unpatriotic. That couldn't be further from the truth. But, those questions, those quandries, and those concerns undoubtibly have not only entered my mind.  Personally, and please don't tell me how inhumane I am, I think they should have killed the S.O.B when they had the chance. Why? To insure HE would not be a problem. He is a sneaking man and as dumb as a fox. That is the truth. Did he give all those he ordered to be tortured a chance? No. Did he give the thousands of men, women, and children that he gassed to death a chance? No. Does he care about the human condition? Only when it applies to him. So why give him the honor of living another day? After all the horrible things he has done and the monsters he has raised, why give him another chance?  And now we have one of his defense lawyers here in the good, ole U.S. of A. telling people that he was tortured and injured, telling people that the affects of prison abuse were also felt by Saddam Hussein. I don't know if that was true or not, but I will admit to two things. One - if it did happen - good. Two - talk about a good public relations attempt to capitalize on an unfortunate and embarrassing situation.  I hope that I am proven wrong in my fears and that he does go to trial and is executed by the Iraqis - the people that he harmed, tortured, and ran a government on fear with for many years.   I also hope that the man from the United States that has joined his defense team realizes what he is doing, being a member of society in America defending a monster like that.

       urlLink WorldNetDaily: Bush to screen population for mental illness : "President Bush plans to unveil next month a sweeping mental health initiative that recommends screening for every citizen and promotes the use of expensive antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs favored by supporters of the administration. "  Does anyone else see anything wrong with requiring every citizen, from pre-school age and up, to have mental health screenings?  This is absolutely ridiculous. Those who have been diagnosed or who have undergone the process knows that it is a sometimes complex and confusing process. I had five misdiagnosis before they realized that I had Social Anxiety Disorder. FIVE. 1 -2 -3 -4- 5. That experience is not uncommon. Not to mention the medication process. Prescriping a certain dosage, monitoring of this dosage is appropriate, re-evaluating the dosage, etc. And who is going to pay for this? WE ARE, the Taxpayers.  So, President Bush can require every citizen to have mental health screenings, but cannot take the money that would go into this, including the money through corporate lobbying and sponsorship, and insure that people have something that they need, like preventive health care?  I am disgusted by this. Why? Because more and more of our rights, our freedoms, that are shouted high off the mountain tops are being invaded. Government isn't getting smaller, it is getting bigger. It is creeping it's ugly head into all aspects of our life.  Perhaps Orwell had mistakenly named his book 1984 when he did intend it to indeed be 2004. One thing for sure, Orwell would sure be proud that although 1984 was a written work of imagination and fiction, it is beginning to prove to be a foreshadowing into what life is like in America at this moment.  And life, right now, is stranger than fiction.

      At the grocery store, I found Carb-Friendly Hamburger Helper. Yes, you read that correctly, Carb-Friendly Hamburger Helper. As I was watching television, I saw an ad for a carb-friendly menu at T.G.I.Fridays. Whether it is the Atkins diet or the South Beach diet, I have two words for you when it comes to low-carb diets - rip and off.  It is amazing how many people are getting rich from the low-carb craze from these 'experts' who create these diets to the companies that manufacture these foods to the book publishers putting this reading material on the shelves to the restaurant chains, even McDonalds, cashing in on the now low-carb, food-watching society we have become. I swear, if I see another low-carb food related commerical on television, whether it is for Applebees or Bacardi, I am going to create a new term for going postal, not to disrespect the disgruntal postal workers around the world, I am going to go carb on these television station's asses.  These diets are fads. Plain and simple. They create a false sense of accomplishment because weight is lost rapidly - AT FIRST. Then it comes off very, very slowly. Until you decide to get off the diet, then you gain it all back, plus some. I have witnessed it for myself, not only buying into the Atkins diet three years ago, but watching my husband fluctuate in his weight so much. The claims made by the Atkins cat burglars that ketosis helps burn fat has been proven untrue by medical researchers. In fact, prolonged ketosis can cause bones to become brittle. You don't hear the experts at Atkins telling you that though. Of course they aren't going to tell you that. Why? They would all be out of jobs.  And this whole South Beach Diet about good carbs and bad carbs. What exactly are good carbs and bad carbs. According to Mayo Clinic, one of the top rated hospitals in the world, there is not such thing. A bad carb is a sugar based product high in calories. You mean eating a candy bar isn't all that healthy? You are kidding me! A good carb is a carb in products that are lower in calories. That's it! Yet people SWEAR by this diet. It isn't a diet, it is common sense that is taught to use with the food pyramid. But put a different spin on it and make millions of dollars.   The Mayo Clinic also states that a red flag should be lifted when diets: Promises of a quick fix  Dire warnings from a single product or regimen  Claims that sound too good to be true  Simplistic conclusions drawn from a complex study  Recommendations based on a single study  Dramatic statements that are refuted by reputable scientific organizations  Lists of "good" and "bad" foods  Advice given to help sell a product  Opinions based on studies published without peer review  Recommendations from studies that ignore differences among individuals or groups  http://www.mayoclinic.com/invoke.cfm?objectid=5F0EFE07-2043-411C-A49B407640B28BFE  Both the South Beach AND Atkins do all of these.  But, what do I know. I am a bad mom who allows her children to eat according to the food pyramid and require limited computer, television, and video game time and require outside play. *sigh*  The low carb industry has played brillantly on two things: a. a society of women that feel the demand to meet some kind of definition of what is accepted as beauty and b. the fear of obesity and the increasing obesity rate in this country.  Sure, you are going to gain weight if you eat and McDonalds and only eat at McDonalds as was done in the documentary Supersize This, an over the top, but hilarious documentary about a man who gained twenty plus pounds by eating at McDonalds three times a day. If you do not exercise, do not allow your body the fruits and vegetables it needs, and do not practice portion control, gaining weight is going to be easy to do.  There are two things that I have notices that have changed since the time I was a child to the ways of our society now: 1. Less people sit down and eat a home-cooked meal together as a family 2. Less people are active because they are too busy.  And, of course, let's not forget our addictions to the internet.  Do yourself a favor, go eat a nice plate of spaghetti with bread sticks and get over your low-carb self.

      Critics. Critics are the biggest group of snobs that I know. Why? Because they try to act like their opinions are unbiased and they simply are not. I can cite two specific examples: My Life by Bill Clinton and Fahrenheit 9/11. I want to state that I have my own political views and what I speak has not-so-much to do with party ties. I do not believe in the two party political system, which I am sure I will rant on about at another time. It has to deal with the fact that individuals use their own political beliefs to dictate whether or not something is 'good' or not.   Over and over on the news, on the web, and in newspapers I have had to hear how horrible Bill Clinton's book, My Life, is. Of course I had to go pick up my own copy and discover for myself. The book is not horrible. The book is not boring. The book is not a self-promoting tool thought up by Mr. Clinton himself.   The book goes through his life, which is perhaps why it is called MY LIFE, and documents important moments of his life. Some critics have said that they were disappointed by how little about Monica Lewinsky was in that book. I hate to disappoint people, especially those that are party whores and use their party ideology to justify every single belief that they have, or as I like to call them, Ba Ba Sheep, but Monica Lewinsky was not all of Clinton's life. He had a life before and a life after Monica. And there are over 15 pages devoted to Monica. Don't believe me? Go to your closest bookstore, look in the index and count them for yourself.   Most of the critics went into this book with preconceived notions on what it should be about, what tales should be written, and how the story should have unfolded. Sorry jerkies, this was HIS book, not yours.   Other idiots, like a few talk radio show hosts and cable news show personalities criticized the book on the first day that it came out, after admittedly only receiving a copy of the book that day. Hate to break it to you, but they did not read all 900 + pages of that book. They decided to thumb through it and base their biased, republican bought butts on a few chapters. Again, more jerkies.   Now let's move on to the Michael Moore film. I went and saw it because I was asked to write an unbiased review on the movie for publication. The movie was ok. Got people thinking. Wasn't lacking Michael Moore's dry humor during the commentary or his in-your-face-style. Wasn't his best work. I leave his best work to Roger and Me. But it was ok.    Now the backlash begins for Michael Moore, having to back up every statement that has been made, which if you are going to present a movie with a topic as serious as this, you better be prepared to. Do people, and by people I mean individuals paid to write about this movie, blindly miss the fact that this movie is going to be based upon his own opinions and will most definitely be biased towards that? Michael Moore has never apologized for himself or what he believes in. Why should this movie be any different.   And then there are idiots like Christopher Hitchens who debunk the movie. If anyone has read his column, it is more than obvious to anyone with two brain cells in their head working in harmony that this guy clearly does not like Michael Moore. And, while he is trying to debunk and prove with 'fact' the inaccuracies of Michael Moore in Fahrenheit 9/11 (which the 9/11 Commission, if being facutal in their reports, have already proven) he gets a few of these 'facts' he states wrong. Like that Iraq was the only country in that region celebrating what happened on that horrible day in September, almost three years ago. Iran, in fact, celebrated as well. Among others. His ranting and raving about Michael Moore is the same ranting and raving that republicans have done on websites like freerepublic.com or in various message boards and political chats. I am sure that I could find a transcript of Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh saying the same things that Christopher Hitchens did in his article.   What happened to unbiased reporting and truth in journalism? Now everyone has a vendetta or parties in their pockets, making them nothing more than literary whores. Cheap whores at that! And those literary whores do a great disservice to the writing community.

       Groupthink:  The act or practice of reasoning or decision-making by a group, especially when characterized by uncritical acceptance or conformity to prevailing points of view.  Yesterday, the U.S Senate Committee on Intelligence reported that the war on Iraq was fought on the basis of absolutely false evidence. The report, over 500 pages ( urlLink read the whole report here)   proves what many have suspected all along,  THERE WAS NO REASON TO GO TO IRAQ!  At least no rational reasons. At least no reasons dealing with Iraq being an immediate threat. At least none of the reasons our President gave this country.  So,are the allegations that were made previous that George Bush said to find something on Iraq, because that was where we were going true? Was this a complete intellegence familiar? Or is the intelligence agencies of the United States taking a fall, much like they did immediate after September 11th, for being ineffective and unneeded. The strange thing about all of this is this:  WE HAVE THE BEST INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES IN THE WORLD; WHY WOULD THESE MISTAKES ME MADE? WHY WERE THESE MISTAKES MADE TWICE DURING ON ADMINISTRATION   Now, I know that Saddam was trying to buy nuclear weapons on the black market, at least that is what we have been told. Guess what!  urlLink So were United States!  Don't believe me? Go ahead, click that link.  Sorry, but my faith in this administration is lost. In some cases, in certain aspects of this country.

      Although some realized before Fahrenheit 9/11 was released that a plane of Saudis and bin Laden family members were rushed out of the United States after the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. What I question, however, is if this half brother of Osama bin Laden was one of them. Even if he wasn't among the siblings living within the United States, it is a bit disheartening to learn that his half brother would not turn him in, and makes me question how many others in his family share this point-of-view.  The article appears below. It is an Associated Press article, which appears here at  urlLink nj.com.  You can see the link for this article at the bottom of the page, along with the link to  urlLink The Raw Story , which is where I first learned of this story.   Half-brother of bin Laden said he never thinks of turning in al-Qaida leader  The Associated Press  7/9/04 11:48 AM   NEW YORK (AP) -- A half-brother of Osama bin Laden said in a television interview he never thinks of whether to turn in the al-Qaida leader and questioned which court would try him.   Asked hypothetically whether he would turn in the al-Qaeda leader, Yeslam Binladin replied: "What do you think? Would you turn in your brother? Or half brother? Tell me. I put the question back to you. You answer it."   In the testy exchange broadcast Friday on the "Today" show, NBC's Matt Lauer responded by saying that someone accused of murdering thousands should have their day in court, to which Binladin agreed.   He then asked "Which court?" when Lauer again questioned whether Binladin would turn in his brother.   "We will go in circles if you want to continue the question," Binladin said.   More of the interview was scheduled to air on "Dateline" Friday night.   Binladin, a Swiss banker who spells his name differently from his half-brother, previously has said he condemns his brother's actions. Yeslam and Osama are among the 54 children of the late Saudi construction magnate Mohammed bin Laden and his 22 wives.   Binladin has been under scrutiny in France and Switzerland during a money-laundering investigation but has never been charged.

      Our president, George Bush, has denied venomously that he and Ken Lay had a friendship, that lay just happened to be a supporter of his and contributed to his campaign. The Smoking Gun has obtained correspondence between Ken Lay and George Bush that goes much further than Ken Lay just being a contributed to his campaign. In one letter, George Bush tells Kenny Boy "Dear Ken: One of the sad things about old friends is that they seem to be getting older - just like you! 55 years old. Wow! That is really old. Thank Goodness you have such a young, beautiful wife. Laura and I value our friendship with you. Best wishes to Linda, your family, and friends. Your younger friend, George W. Bush."  There are 40 pages of correspondence exchanged between the both of them available on The Smoking Gun Web Site. You can find it here: http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/bushlay1.html  This first appeared here: http://www.therawstory.com  I don't know about you, and I am sure his staunch supporters will defend this, but this is another example for me on how the President has lied to me. I really admired President Bush at one point, now I feel betrayed and duped. This is particularly important now that Ken Lay has officially been charged with the Enron scandal. Today, President Bush would not comment on the situation with Ken Lay when asked. Instead, he rushed past the reporters when questions began to be asked in relation to Ken Lay and Enron.

       urlLink    US warns Sudan over not honoring pledge of immediate action in Darfur  20 minutes ago      WASHINGTON (AFP) - US Secretary of State Colin Powell (news - web sites) warned Sudan to honor its pledge of immediate action to stop the bloodshed in the troubled Darfur region or risk facing global action.    AFP/US Embassy-HO/File Photo         "We need immediate improvement in the situation, and if we don't see that, then the United States and the international community will have to consider further measures," Powell said at the release of a US Congress-commissioned report on Africa policy.    Powell said the United States had drafted a UN Security Council resolution seeking sanctions on militia leaders behind the violence and noted that it was being discussed with selected council members.    He said the resolution called upon the Sudanese government to immediately fulfill all of its pledges and give access to aid workers and international monitors.    "Too many lives have been lost and we cannot lose any more time," said Powell, who pressed for action after seeing the deteriorating situation in the region for himself during a whirlwind visit to Darfur and a refugee camp there last week.    More than 10,000 people are estimated to have died in Darfur and more than a million have been driven from their homes since a revolt against the Arab-dominated government broke out among indigenous ethnic minorities in February 2003.    In retaliation, the pro-government Arab Janjaweed militias have carried out what UN officials say is a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing against black Africans.    The Sudanese authorities had promised Powell during his visit that Khartoum would immediately send more government forces to provide security, ease restrictions on humanitarian groups and speed up negotiations with rebel groups.    "The situation on the ground must change and must change quickly," Powell warned.    "We will continue to press them, will continue to monitor them. We will continue to make sure that we are not just left with promises but we are left with actual action and performance on the ground."

      PAKISTAN FOR BUSH. July Surprise? by John B. Judis, Spencer Ackerman & Massoud Ansari          Post date 07.07.04 | Issue date 07.19.04     Late last month, President Bush lost his greatest advantage in his bid for reelection. A poll conducted by ABC News and The Washington Post discovered that challenger John Kerry was running even with the president on the critical question of whom voters trust to handle the war on terrorism. Largely as a result of the deteriorating occupation of Iraq, Bush lost what was, in April, a seemingly prohibitive 21-point advantage on his signature issue. But, even as the president's poll numbers were sliding, his administration was implementing a plan to insure the public's confidence in his hunt for Al Qaeda.   This spring, the administration significantly increased its pressure on Pakistan to kill or capture Osama bin Laden, his deputy, Ayman Al Zawahiri, or the Taliban's Mullah Mohammed Omar, all of whom are believed to be hiding in the lawless tribal areas of Pakistan. A succession of high-level American officials--from outgoing CIA Director George Tenet to Secretary of State Colin Powell to Assistant Secretary of State Christina Rocca to State Department counterterrorism chief Cofer Black to a top CIA South Asia official--have visited Pakistan in recent months to urge General Pervez Musharraf's government to do more in the war on terrorism. In April, Zalmay Khalilzad, the American ambassador to Afghanistan, publicly chided the Pakistanis for providing a "sanctuary" for Al Qaeda and Taliban forces crossing the Afghan border. "The problem has not been solved and needs to be solved, the sooner the better," he said.   This public pressure would be appropriate, even laudable, had it not been accompanied by an unseemly private insistence that the Pakistanis deliver these high-value targets (HVTs) before Americans go to the polls in November. The Bush administration denies it has geared the war on terrorism to the electoral calendar. "Our attitude and actions have been the same since September 11 in terms of getting high-value targets off the street, and that doesn't change because of an election," says National Security Council spokesman Sean McCormack. But The New Republic has learned that Pakistani security officials have been told they must produce HVTs by the election. According to one source in Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), "The Pakistani government is really desperate and wants to flush out bin Laden and his associates after the latest pressures from the U.S. administration to deliver before the [upcoming] U.S. elections." Introducing target dates for Al Qaeda captures is a new twist in U.S.-Pakistani counterterrorism relations--according to a recently departed intelligence official, "no timetable[s]" were discussed in 2002 or 2003--but the November election is apparently bringing a new deadline pressure to the hunt. Another official, this one from the Pakistani Interior Ministry, which is responsible for internal security, explains, "The Musharraf government has a history of rescuing the Bush administration. They now want Musharraf to bail them out when they are facing hard times in the coming elections." (These sources insisted on remaining anonymous. Under Pakistan's Official Secrets Act, an official leaking information to the press can be imprisoned for up to ten years.)   A third source, an official who works under ISI's director, Lieutenant General Ehsan ul-Haq, informed tnr that the Pakistanis "have been told at every level that apprehension or killing of HVTs before [the] election is [an] absolute must." What's more, this source claims that Bush administration officials have told their Pakistani counterparts they have a date in mind for announcing this achievement: "The last ten days of July deadline has been given repeatedly by visitors to Islamabad and during [ul-Haq's] meetings in Washington." Says McCormack: "I'm aware of no such comment." But according to this ISI official, a White House aide told ul-Haq last spring that "it would be best if the arrest or killing of [any] HVT were announced on twenty-six, twenty-seven, or twenty-eight July"--the first three days of the Democratic National Convention in Boston.      The Bush administration has matched this public and private pressure with enticements and implicit threats. During his March visit to Islamabad, Powell designated Pakistan a major non-nato ally, a status that allows its military to purchase a wider array of U.S. weaponry. Powell pointedly refused to criticize Musharraf for pardoning nuclear physicist A.Q. Khan--who, the previous month, had admitted exporting nuclear secrets to Iran, North Korea, and Libya--declaring Khan's transgressions an "internal" Pakistani issue. In addition, the administration is pushing a five-year, $3 billion aid package for Pakistan through Congress over Democratic concerns about the country's proliferation of nuclear technology and lack of democratic reform.   But Powell conspicuously did not commit the United States to selling F-16s to Pakistan, which it desperately wants in order to tilt the regional balance of power against India. And the Pakistanis fear that, if they don't produce an HVT, they won't get the planes. Equally, they fear that, if they don't deliver, either Bush or a prospective Kerry administration would turn its attention to the apparent role of Pakistan's security establishment in facilitating Khan's illicit proliferation network. One Pakistani general recently in Washington confided in a journalist, "If we don't find these guys by the election, they are going to stick this whole nuclear mess up our asshole."   Pakistani perceptions of U.S. politics reinforce these worries. "In Pakistan, there has been a folk belief that, whenever there's a Republican administration in office, relations with Pakistan have been very good," says Khalid Hasan, a U.S. correspondent for the Lahore-based Daily Times. By contrast, there's also a "folk belief that the Democrats are always pro-India." Recent history has validated those beliefs. The Clinton administration inherited close ties to Pakistan, forged a decade earlier in collaboration against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. But, by the time Clinton left office, the United States had tilted toward India, and Pakistan was under U.S. sanctions for its nuclear activities. All this has given Musharraf reason not just to respond to pressure from Bush, but to feel invested in him--and to worry that Kerry, who called the Khan affair a "disaster," and who has proposed tough new curbs on nuclear proliferation, would adopt an icier line.   Bush's strategy could work. In large part because of the increased U.S. pressure, Musharraf has, over the last several months, significantly increased military activity in the tribal areas--regions that enjoy considerable autonomy from Islamabad and where, until Musharraf sided with the United States in the war on terrorism, Pakistani soldiers had never set foot in the nation's 50-year history. Thousands of Pakistani troops fought a pitched battle in late March against tribesmen and their Al Qaeda affiliates in South Waziristan in hopes of capturing Zawahiri. The fighting escalated significantly in June. Attacks on army camps in the tribal areas brought fierce retaliation, leaving over 100 tribal and foreign militants and Pakistani soldiers dead in three days. Last month, Pakistan killed a powerful Waziristan warlord and Qaeda ally, Nek Mohammed, in a dramatic rocket attack that villagers said bore American fingerprints. (They claim a U.S. spy plane had been circling overhead.) Through these efforts, the Pakistanis could bring in bin Laden, Mullah Omar, or Zawahiri--a significant victory in the war on terrorism that would bolster Bush's reputation among voters.   But there is a reason many Pakistanis and some American officials had previously been reluctant to carry the war on terrorism into the tribal areas. A Pakistani offensive in that region, aided by American high-tech weaponry and perhaps Special Forces, could unite tribal chieftains against the central government and precipitate a border war without actually capturing any of the HVTs. Military action in the tribal areas "has a domestic fallout, both religious and ethnic," Pakistani Foreign Minister Mian Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri complained to the Los Angeles Times last year. Some American intelligence officials agree. "Pakistan just can't risk a civil war in that area of their country. They can't afford a western border that is unstable," says a senior intelligence official, who anonymously authored the recent Imperial Hubris: Why the West is Losing the War on Terror and who says he has not heard that the current pressures on Pakistan are geared to the election. "We may be at the point where [Musharraf] has done almost as much as he can."   Pushing Musharraf to go after Al Qaeda in the tribal areas may be a good idea despite the risks.
