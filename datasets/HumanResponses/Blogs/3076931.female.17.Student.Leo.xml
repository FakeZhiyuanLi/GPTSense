        well..yes..I did give in to his whole online journal thing. I do feel like a dumbass tho..cuz I really can't figuire this shit out. Maybe it's because I just didn't go to sleep last night..hmm.... I think i might keep this for my own private viewing for a little while..and then i will show myself to the world..ha yeah.   Yeah well...speaking of weed...? yeah i dunno..my parents recently found out that I have been a "shmokin da reefa". Yeah it was pretty bad.  Damn those blood tests. My mom was really mad. Well more sad than mad. She cried. I cried. We all cried.  I had to keep assuring her that I was not a drug addict and that i did not need to go to drug rehab.  I feel really bad.  I'm not a bad person. It's really weird when your parents know that kind of shit about you. I'm not going to smoke anymore.  I get random drug tests now! YAY! Everything's cool now.  My mom jokes around about me being a pot-head (which i am SO not). I just can't lie to her. She is extremely against lying.    "He" hasn't called in 2 days. Damn those boys.  I swear..i have the WORST luck with guys.  They all either A. have girlfriends          B. are cock heads ( like the certain guy with thick ankles bah)          C. aren't even interested          D. are ugly (sorry but hey..i guess i'm shallow..i dunno)          E. or ALL OF THE ABOVE! and i know there are more choices!   I give up on guys.  Seventeen years old, and i have NEVER in my life had a boyfriend.  I have finally come to the conclusion that i don't want one. I don't need one. Yeah..i'll just keep telling myself that. I'll stick to the flings and the random hook ups...they're fine with me.   I looked for chalk again today. Not a single peice. Really pissed me off.  What does someone have to do for chalk around this damn house.  Sorry..i will stop venting about chalk.    I must go work on yearbook. ahh yes..designing spreads..mmmmmmm..i think i'm hungry too....

      I have finally decided we're over. Well we were never a "we", but whatever it was..it's over.  If he calls anymore, I'm gonna either not answer..or just tell him straight up that it's over. I dunno. He was my weakness. I'm sick of dealing with all the shit...waiting for phone calls and knowing that i'm the other girl. I was just a booty call i guess. But NO MORE! and it feels really good that i have finally come to the conclusion that this has to end. I guess i'm glad that I was the one that made the decision. it feels pretty damn good. but at the same time kinda sad. I really do want a guy. and it sucks. blagh. oh well.   in other news! YEARBOOKS ARE IN! wahoooooo they come out friday..but staff gets to see them tomorrow night at our little party. weeeeeee. I'm so excited. Other than that, everythings been boring. nothing exciting.   I feel so empowered! i dunno why...i guess for the first time, it has been my decision to end something with a guy. i feel strong! wahoo so there will be no more boring entries about "him". yay

      Boys never cease to amaze me. They don't call for days. Then all of a sudden your phone goes off at 1:45 am and it's him.  crazy.  I don't know what to do. Crazy that he can always somehow be the topic of almost every entry I write. Does that mean I'm thinking about him too much? hmmm.. So I sit here..and I'm waiting for him to come over...like he said he was. Which is awful..I don't know if I should be waiting eagerly with anticipation or waiting with dread. What I'm doing is SO wrong..and I know it..and that's the bad thing. But I'm doing it anyways. HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND, TRINA! It's so hard for me not to give into temptation. Why can't he not have a girlfriend? then I wouldn't have to deal with all this guilt. why did he even have to tell me he had one? well I guess it's good that he did...cuz I'd be pissed if I found out later that he had a girlfriend. Oh well..as far as we're concerned we are just friends. Good friends. No more. right? right. right. right. RIGHT. aghhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Sometimes I wonder if he's sober or not when we talk on the phone. he's all into the drugs and shit..which worries me. and its not like the average guy..where he only does it a little...it's like his way of life.  He does it WAY too much..and I do NOT need to deal with a druggie. bah. oh well. everything will work itself out. hopefully. i'll be waiting for it to work out and all fall into place.

      I feel so alone. And it's such a foreign feeling to me because i have really never let myself be alone. For the first time in my life i really do feel alone and i am alone. And i know i've done it to myself. I've always constantly had people around me. And now things have changed so drasitically that it's awkward. I don't even know what to do. I really need someone. anyone. i'm not talking about boyfriends or anything like that. I just wish someone would understand. I don't know why i did what i did. Maybe it was that i just felt lost with everyone. I felt like i was getting lost. god this sounds like i'm trying terribly to sound all deep and shit but it's nothing like that. Things have changed so much. It didn't really bother me at first. I think i may have liked the change a little. But now i think things just finally caught up to me and hit me in the face.  I want to pick up the phone and call someone to talk to about everything, but then i realize that i really truly don't have anyone to call. No one would understand, and i don't really think people would really even want to hear from me and/or give me the time. I feel so out of place with "them" now. don't get me wrong, i know i've done it myself. it's just such a weird feeling. I don't know what to do with it.  and i know i can't change things and go back to normal cuz things just don't work that way.  I mean i try to focus on the positive things..all the things i have going to for me..but it's just so hard to focus on that and not let my mind wander to all the other things. things that i wish didn't bother me. I wish i could be strong. I want to be seen as a strong person, but honestly inside i feel like the weakest person out there.  I want to feel wanted. And i don't feel like i'm wanted by anyone. and it really really hurts. why have i done this? I keep asking myself the same question.   I drove by her car today in the back row of the junior lot and i saw the tennessee sticker in her front window..and i knew it was her car. I drove up by it and stopped. I got out my pen and a piece of paper, and then i chickened out. it was the pad of paper that says "from somebody pretty damn important". The one she was going to leave on a person parked in the handicap lot that we thought didn't have a handicap pass. haha. I was going to leave a note..but then i realized i didn't know where to start.  I don't know what happened.  I want to know what happened myself, believe me.   i know i've distanced myself from some people..and by doing that..i've distanced myself with other people that i didn't want to be distanced from. i guess it's just because they're all together..it's the crew. but sometimes when we would hang out on the weekends, i just felt so out of place and unwanted. i know i say that and some may not believe me..but it really did come out that way. Sometimes the things people said or did really did hurt me. and i was just sick of all the negativity and having to deal with that. i dunno. I keep trying to search for answers...but i don't think i will ever find them.   Lick -i miss you and it hurts. i dont know why. i don't even know what happened. I want to call you but i'm too scared. I don't know why. I guess i'm afraid that you have resentment and anger towards me and i'm too afraid to deal with that. I never wanted to lose you as a friend. so many things have changed. I didn't want it to be this way. I just wanted some things to change..i didn't want a totally different life. I think i'm saying this all to you because i always felt like you were the one i felt most comfortable with and that understood me. and now that i don't have that person, it feels so weird. i'm so sorry for whatever i did. I may have wanted to distance myself from other people, but i didn't want to distance myself from you. I'm sorry. i don't know what happened.  I don't even know if you'll see this.

      In exactly four months from today, I will be 18 and legal! wahoo. I suddenly got excited about turning 18 today.  And I've actually decided that I am going to get a tattoo. or two. Well..I'll start with one. My first tattoo I want is a four leaf clover. so I'll have good luck always and forever. The other tattoo I want is one that says lucky 7 like they do on the slot machines in casinos. yay cuz 7 is my lucky number.  These tattoos are def gonna be hidden..no places that are going to be visible while I am fully clothed..cuz if my dad found out..he would KILL me. Not so much my mom. She wants to get one but my daddy-o won't let her. I guess she doesn't do it out of respect for him. Hmm..I still have respect for my dad..but come on, it's my body.   So today was incredibly uneventful.  I decided not to go to school today, so I pretty much sat around the house and ate. My parents left for New Orleans today. wahoo no parents. hit me up if u wanna party. haha. This is a really boring entry. So i'll stop writing.  oh yeah..shout out to my brother...he's the big 13 today! weee happy birthday, bro!

      Yearbook editor positions are in!             Co-editor in Chiefs: Taylor and Me!             Designing editor : Chesney             Photography editor: Stephanie             Writing editor: Lauren             Business editor: Amber  Congrats to everyone! I'm looking forward to working with all of you and i'm SOO ready to get started on our awesome yearbook!!  well enough yearbook stuff! Nothing too eventful has happened to me. That could be a good thing or a bad thing. Prom is this weekend! yay? well..not really..for losers like me who don't have dates. heh. oh well. My parents leave for New Orleans tomorrow. yeah..party at trina's. They're going to my 3rd favorite city, but it's okay..i get the whole house to myself.   This weekend when i was hanging out with my friend carrie...my old friend david called and he came over and hung out with us.  David's a really nice guy. I liked him for maybe a week..and then confessed to him and he told me he didn't want to lose the friendship we had. I cried to him on the phone, and now as i look back at that, i feel so stupid and embarrassed. Oh well.  I think he's the only guy that i've ever liked that's actually a "good guy", so that was a change. Well after our talk..we stopped talking. And i did realize that i actually didn't like him..i now see him as more like a brother. So it was a nice surprise when he called me. It was nice. He's a really good guy. One of the few i know. which leads into my next thought....  Are there really ANY good guys out there? Because i'm seriously starting to think that all guys are assholes. Maybe i'm just meeting all the wrong ones. I don't think i could ever trust a guy, no matter how nice he was. Guys only want one thing..and one thing only..SEX. ahh yes..it's so TRUE!! I guess guys can't help it.  It's like this hunger that they have to feed. I'm starting to think sex is the only thing that's on a guy's mind. I mean okay sex is great (so i hear..)...but come on..there is more!! I dunno. It sucks. Guys suck. I need more luck in the guy department. I need a guy. bah. SOMEBODY HELP ME

        Could I  BE any happier right now? Hahaha I am just ECSTATIC because me and Taylor are both editors-in-chief for the yearbook next year!!! BOTH OF US.... TOGETHER!! Editor-in-chief. That is just so amazing. I'm sorry it may seem like nothing for some people, but for me it is everything.  Yearbook is my life, and it means so much to me..and now I (with taylor) am editor in chief. This makes me happier than anything in the world. I could care less about prom or stupid boys. Editor-in-chief is all I have to say! Wow. This is just amazing. This seriously makes me happier than anything else right now.  Someone could come up to me and punch me in the face and I would still be happy. The way I see it is that this is one more step closer to my future. It gives me great experience for the journalism world. Especially since I've seriously been considering majoring in journalism. GAHHH..I'm freaking out...I can't even type I'm so excited.    alright..more good news. haha..enough already i know! Well....this summer i'm quite possibly gonna go to boston university (my DREAM college) for one month!! wahooo. I'm not 100% positive yet tho. But still..it would be amazing.    I swear this day could not get any better. I love today! Long live today!

      It makes me sick that I sit waiting for his phone call.  Sometimes I just want to pick up the phone and call him, but i know better.  I don't think I'm falling for him, but I do think i'm "falling into his trap".  I find myself actually believing the things he tells me.  And he makes me feel good about myself. I like the things he says about me.  I like how we are alike in the smallest ways.  I like how he holds me.  I like how he introduces me to his friends and takes pride in me. I like how we can talk on the phone for hours at a time.  That makes me sick that I like all these things. I'm not like that!  I don't want that to be me.  I don't want to be that girl that needs attention from guys just so she can feel good about herself. Maybe I don't like him.  Maybe i just like the attention i'm getting from him.  I don't know what is wrong with me.  I wish I could just brush him off and treat him like all the other guys.  All the meaningless nothings i've had with different guys that don't mean anything to me.  It doesn't bother me that he can't give me a relationship(we won't get into that), it's kind of a relief that he doesn't want a relationship. Hell, all i want is fun. I'm seventeen, i need to live life.  I don't want to stay tied down to one guy. But sometimes i feel like i'm competing for time with him with the other girl... THe girl that's been in his life for a year and a half. Yeah. talk about drama.  DAMN! I really do think that i only like the fact that he likes me.  i don't know if I like him. I feel bad leading him on...but i want to have fun.  There's nothing wrong with having fun. I dunno, maybe he won't call ever again and i won't have to deal with him. Isn't that awful? Why do i think such things? But it's so true...if he doesn't call, then i don't have to deal with all the shit and i can get over it and move on. LIke i've done all my life...the story of my life. BAh i don't knwo what to do. SOmetimes i wish i had someone who could make all my decisions for me and tell me what to do so i wouldn't have to stress over shit. Well, actually, no i wouldn't want that. That would really suck.  Well i'm off. Night.

      Today was such a happy day. I could seriously not stop smiling! And i swear it's not becuase "he" called (okay maybe it adds a LITTLE to the happiness). It was all the little things that made me happy today. It all began with a wonderful Wednesday morning when i get to sleep an hour extra..rock on, i love my sleep. English went well, it was a fun class. Then in ap bio, spencer gave me a pack of big bunny chalk! Which totally rocked my face off! That was so sweet of him to do! THe little things are what counts! and that was awesome! thanks spencer! you are the coolest! SOooo of course during yearbook i went outside and chalked up the school's sidewalks...hope i don't get in trouble for that, oops.   ANd it's not just today that made me happy. Last night during work, megan handed me the cutest little note ever that made me feel all warm and happy inside ( and maybe misty hahahahha). It made me so happy. I love the little things people do. And i know that i need to do little things for other people too. I don't need to get absorbed in my own little world like most teenagers do. I'm going to make it my goal to do random acts of kindness everyday. Oo and compliment people also. And when i say compliment i mean compliments that actually do mean something, not just a compliment that someone says just so they have something to say to you. Because what if someone is having a crappy day. So many times i've been having a crappy day and then someone will do a little something and it will just make my day and makes me happy. SO i must return that favor. It's all about the karma. RIght? i hope i used that right. The little things really do matter. I think i began to realize this when i had surgery and was on crutches. The little things that people did helped me SOOO much. I cannot thank you all enough. All the people who would stop by and visit me. It made me realize who all actually cared and who all didn't. And it wasn't just the people that would stop by and visit me. There were also the random people who i had never talked to in my life before that would help me out at school, like opening a door. Opening a door sounds like such a small thing, but when you're on crutches and you're carrying a 40 lb backpack, it is the nicest thing a stranger can do. It's all about the little things, people! I'm so glad i'm a happy person. If i wasn't a happy person...i would be mad. Haha i hope that makes sense. It makes sense to me, but i'm weird..  I was also happy because i finished my ap bio packet before 8! it was such a relief!! we were in the library for 3 hours! haha. O and i also found my purse! yay!   so.. the lesson here kids is : do little things. Make someone's day. Bah i'm so cheesy. it's okay i like being cheesy. ooo which reminds me, i had the best peanut butter today. I had like too spoonfuls of peanut butter and i NEVER do that. I don't even like peanuts.   ..i wonder how many times i said "the little things" in here...

      I don't want people to think I'm a shallow person and i'm really afraid that people think that i am. Sure i'm loud and goofy blah blah...but there is more to me. I dunno it just upsets me that NO ONE really knows me except for a few people like my mom.  And i know that it's my fault. There are so many things people don't know about me.  I write. I love writing..(haha my writing skills may not be all that great in here..but i do write other thoughts somewhere else, believe me) i also have realized that i actually do have somewhat of a passion for the yearbook.  Just working on designing my own yearbook made me realize how important to me that class is. I really enjoy what i do.   I guess no one would guess that i'm an insightful person (or at least i think i am). I actually do THINK about things. I'm not stupid. I don't know why i suddenly started thinking about this.  I've been thinking a lot about things like this the past few months.  Maybe it's because i had somewhat of a "revelation" recently.  That may sound cheesy, but honestly i think that was what it was.  bah reading that makes me laugh. oh well ANYWAYS... so i had this "revelation" and i started thinking a lot more about things.  Just certain things.  Things that i'm going to keep private for myself.  I'm really glad though that i started thinking about all these things, because it helped me figuire out who i am.  I am just now figuiring out who i am.  I don't care what anyone thinks anymore.  I am so sick of pleasing other people.  Yeah it's my fault that no one really knows who i am, yeah its my fault people think i'm shallow..but i guess it's good that i know that i'm not.  Maybe that is all that matters.  That is all that matters.  i know that the ONLY people who REALLY care about me in this world are my parents and  my brother.  They    are the people who will be there until the end. They are the only people that truly, honestly matter to me right now.  They are the only ones who know me and the only ones who will ever know me.   I guess i'm just really upset that it took me so long to figuire that out.  I spent too much time with others who don't give a shit about me and ignored the people who really do care.  And i feel awful for  doing that.   WoW.   Night.

        Yearbook presentations are over! WHEW! I was totally stressing over those things.  I was designing spreads night and day. I was eating, sleeping, and drinking yearbook!  That yearbook's my baby. I really like the spreads i designed...and i may try out to be an editor next year..hmmm...... Now I get to stress out about AP bio. woohooo.   My weekend was grand! I got to see Lisa! I LOVE LISA! It made me feel like old times. We reminisced about 6th grade and old times.  It's always the same when we hang out. I never feel weird around her and that is awesome.  I'm glad that we can go without seeing eachother for like 2 years, but then see eachother again and be the same as we were in 6th grade.   It's so odd that it's Monday and i'm in such a giddy mood. Maybe it's the weather. Maybe it's the whole yearbook thing. Or maybe i'm just weird.  It's one of those. I should be like stressed out over school and college and shit.      Oh yeah...the shitty four letter word...prom.  Oh well.  I really want to go with a guy that i like, but yeah i don't like any one, so that could be a problem.  It really sucks.  I already returned my dress cuz i figuired i'm not going to be going anyways. I've just talked myself into that.  I'm preparing myself for prom night.  Me,Myself and I.  It would be awesome if someone asked..but that is not going to happen.  It's okay. I'm a better person than that.  I shouldn't let stupid things like prom upset me right? I guess some people deserve to go more than i do.. i dunno. It's okay.  I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go. I'll just keep telling myself that.  My parents will be out of town..so maybe i could just hit up the liquor and get drunk off my ass, all by myself. Ooo i'm excited.  Oh no, look at wut i've done. The giddyness is going away....bring it back..bring back the giddyness..   haha it's funny how little things are so funny.  Megan and I will leave random 5 minute messages on eachother's phones and we FREAK out and pee in our pants about how funny we are. ( 3/8's megan hahaha)  hahaha i love little stupid things. Without them..i would be upset about stupid things..like prom. BAH! ohhhh nooo..i also need a date for presentation..bah. guys have it sooo easy.    i think i'm gonna go outside and wash my car. and play with chalk. and eat. eating is good.

      Being grounded really sucks. I only got grounded for this week though..which is pretty cool since i'm grounded for smoking weed.   My parent's understand that i'm a good person.Which i LOVE.  My parents really are awesome. THey understand that i'm a teenager and i will be a teenager.   I've really changed the last like 2 months and they see that.  I've actually put forth effort on being a family member, cuz i realized that soon i'm going to be away to college. and that made me really sad cuz i have to leave my little brother who is going to be 13 in a few weeks and i realized that i barely know him. That just made me really sad. It's hard when you have a 4 1/2 year age difference. Back to being grounded...   at least i haven't been completely grounded...i still have my car, i can still do stuff after school, i just can't go out tonight..and tonight is FRIDAY. bah. Well it's kinda okay cuz i have ACT's tomorrow..yeesh. I made a 26( i think?)  both times i freakin took that thing..yeah i'm stupid...my dad's like you better make a 30 this time. No pressure there.  I absolutely HATE tests! But tomorrow after i take the test, i get to go down to Hot-lanta to visit my bestest friend in the whole world, LISA! i'm so excited! it should be really fun. I still can't believe i'm sitting at home on the computer on a friday night. HA. Oh well.  Maybe i should just get used to it. I never had any hot dates on friday nights anyways. Speaking of hot dates.... "HE" still hasn't called. But i know why....because he's WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND. gah.it's okay..it's okay i'm cool, i'm calm. I feel like such a loser today. I don't want to be a loser..PLEASE DON'T LET ME BECOME A LOSERRRRRRRRR

      Goodbye Knoxville. Goodbye Tennessee. Goodbye USA. Goodbye North America. Hello India.  I leave today in about 45 minutes. I thought i'd sit down here at the computer for a bit. I don't know if this will be my last entry before i get back...i might update while i'm there.  I hope i have a good time. I'm excited but at the same time i'm not.  It should be a great learning experience. Wish me luck in India! I come back June 22! yay! E-mail me and stay in touch, homies! I love you all!

      according to www.deathclock.com I'm going to die Friday, December 18,2082. lol. i thought that was really funny.  ANYWAYS...yesterday was the last day of SCHOOL! hell yeah. i went out to eat and then played volleyball with my cool yearbookies. we realized that we SUCK at volleyball. They're all going to the lake w/o me next week. :( last night was fun as well. Hung with my coolest homies ever! i love you guys! We did girly things and then went to sundown..which was fun! Next time tho..we're gonna be those hippie dancers we've decided..and if someone isn't having a good time, we're not gonna let that ruin it for us. We wrote all over our cars "SENIORS 2005" just cuz we're losers like that. We ended up in some random park with some random guys..and got bored with that so then went to Shakie Shake to get some FROOD. we decided to have piggy back races in the parking lot.  I have to say i am so proud of my parents. We got in at 2:53 am last night (err this morning), and my mom was even in the kitchen getting water, and she didn't care. I am SO HAPPY that they finally trust me again!! so happy!

      I'm having mixed feelings about my trip to India.  I want to go so bad because I haven't been back since I was 8 and I want to see my family, but also I feel as though I'm missing out on a huge chunk of my summer.  But then again, what would I miss out on? Who all I would hang out with...since I really don't have a true definite group anymore...just sparatic friends. Who I will miss greatly. I hope they don't forget me while I'm gone. So maybe this trip is for the better. Or maybe not. I can't make up my mind. Oh well I'm going and that's that. Nothing is going to change about that.   Enough on India! BAH! So school is over..pretty much..I only have to take one final. SO that is pretty exciting. Seniors next year. Wow. I still feel like I'm 14. I really feel like I'm stuck at 14. But that was almost 4 years ago. wooooo time flies. It's kinda sad seein how all the seniors are parting and I just keep thinking that that's gonna be me next year. SCARY! I still remember the first day of 9th grade like it was yesterday. I wore my short denim skirt and my three quarter length navy and yellow striped polo shirt. How weird that I remember that...  High school has been an amazing experience. I mean sure it had it's shitty points and it had its awesome points..but overall it's been awesome. I really have learned so much..about myself..about people...and about life. It's gonna be a little sad next year leaving all of those memories behind.   wow..i'm not even a senior yet....haha

      Clothes Clothes clothes and suitcases are EVERYWHERE! My house is a freakin looney bin with my mom going crazy about packin it up for the big India trip. Yep. Going to India for 1 month and we're leaving this Saturday. My house is crazy.  It looks like someone broke in and just ripped our whole house apart. So upon my mother's craziness..i've been packing and cleaning my head off. And as much as i love cleaning (ha) i would so much rather be outside in the nice weather and just kick it back..maybe with some chalk...but NO i must clean!  Last night was fun. I hung out with Cherry, Jennifer, and Jessica. We went bowling. Had good clean fun. We came home at like 3am and my 'rents didn't care..so i really do feel like they're starting to trust me again, which is VERY nice. It was nice hanging out with all of them. They came back and we scratched backs, even tho Jess sucks at it haha. it's okay jess. haha i'm wearin her bearden shirt to school tomorrow and she's wearin my farragut shirt..we're gonna see our fellow peer's reactions, it should be great. well i'm gonna go. i have a hot date..with the vaccumm.   OMG--i almost forgot...last night when we were passing by the Rush..i decided i would be stupid and call up Jason, cuz i wanted to see him..just cuz i was curious. So i went by and said hey. Nothing more just a hug and some small talk. I have no Freaking clue why i did that.  I felt like such an idiot. It may have been cuz i was all like dressed up and i just wanted him to see what he was missing out on. HA. okay i'm OFFF  Me + Vaccum = HOT DATE!  VROOOOOM VROOOOOOOm. god i'm a nerd

      i had forgotten what a hang over feels like until today. it sucks.  especially since i can't sit around and do nothing...cuz we have to celebrate mother's day agh. i swear...never drink burnette or whatever the fuck you call it vodka. cheap ass shit... tastes like cheap ass shit too. nasty.  my head hurts. and i can't get that fucking taste out of my mouth  took 3 advil. waiting for the results. nope..none. maybe i should take more? how many advils can you take?   i was proud of myself..i told my mom yesterday that i wasn't going to clean my room just because she was telling me to. I'm almost fucking eighteen years old. i'm so sick of being told "you can't do anything until you clean your room". so yesterday i was like fuck it. so i told her. and i didn't clean my room. one more step toward adulthood....haha.   poetry time!  Laura becomes a poem: hey peter i think you're weetaaded oops i think i just faahhted oh no i think i just caught it. .. a cold...that is.   ----by "shid"

           When I was in kindergarten some girl called me ugly because of my skin color. Its so odd that I remember that because I don't remember much from when I was younger.  I remember coming home and crying to my mom about it.  Lucky for me, that has been the only account (that I remember) that I've had to deal with that kind of stuff.  Especially since I've grown up in farragut...a small close-minded town.  And that really makes me happy.  I really don't feel skin color is an issue when it comes to my friends or whatever.  I never feel out of place because of the color of my skin. And I love that.  I am comfortable in my own skin and I don't care that I'm a different color nor do any of my friends care. That's why I can joke around about my "brown-ness" with people and people can call me brown.  It's a fact...I'm brown..So why should it not be spoken of? When my family goes out to eat with another couple ( usually a white couple) and the waiter asks, "how shall the check be split"..My parents just simply state "We brown people on one check". It's funny cuz the waiters never know how to react..They kinda nervously laugh it off and they're like oooh okay. We know we're brown, you know we're brown...So why not just state it point blank?       That then brings me to the whole southern pride, rebel flag deal. I mean I know I'm not black... But it's just so offensive to me. It makes me so angry to see all that around..And it's everywhere cuz we live in Tennessee. I saw a kid wearing a shirt that said "The South will Rise again". Seriously, people...You anger me. The other day me and my friends were walking down the hall and some black guys walked by and passed us..And then I heard these guys behind us go "fuckin n****** ( I don't like to say that word), I got so angry that I turned around and I said " Don't ever fucking say that ever again." I mean usually I just wouldn't say stuff like that to random people, but it just made me so mad that I couldn't even bite my tounge and it just slipped out.  It pissed me off so bad. It ruined my day. I mean I know I'm not black..But I just feel so strongly about it. Maybe it's because I'm a different skin color also but I really think I would feel the same even if I was white or yellow or red or purple or green.  When I see someone with the rebel flag hat or t-shirt or whatever and they show a strong dislikes in blacks...It makes me wonder how they feel about me...I mean I am brown.  I will never understand those people. Nor will I ever try to.  If I see someone who has a rebel flag hat on or t-shirt..I know that I do not what to get to know that person..No matter how nice he or she is or whatever.  I know I'm being judgmental..And I'm sorry. That's just how its gonna be.

      So I realized the other day that I have taken being a girl for granted.  A girl can get whatever she wants...because she's a girl. And if you use your "traits" correctly, you can get away with anything. Maybe it's because I'll be 18 soon...but lately I've started to feel  sexy . Is that bad? Not sexy in a dirty way...but sexy in the way I feel. And because of that I've realized that I've been holding back a lot.  Suddenly  I have the urge to wear the lowest cut tops I can find...but not to the point where it's trashy, but so it's sexy and classy.  I mean come on..I know I'm not very gifted in the boob department...but I have a some..and hey I'm young..and now's the time I can wear those kind of things. Even though sometimes it is a bit awkward when you're trying to have a conversation with someone and they're looking at your cleavage instead of your face..."hello, I'm up here!" but I guess when you wear tops like that, you're asking for that sort of attention. I've always been the jeans and t-shirt girl. I think I'm finally growing out of that. Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe I'm just going through a weird phase.   I'm finally comfortable with the size of my breasts! and that makes me happy! I don't want them any bigger or any smaller! I like them the way they are.   Okay enough about boobs.

      I don't understand why we have to  clean  before the  cleaning  lady gets here.  That defeats the whole purpose of a  cleaning  lady...because a  cleaning  lady, last time I checked,  cleans . So therefore, if you  clean  before the  cleaning  lady gets to your house, the  cleaning  lady has nothing to  clean . Poor  cleaning  lady, you love to  clean  but have nothing to  clean .     This is for you, cleaning lady. 9:00 A.M. Wake up. The cleaning lady is coming. Pick up. The cleaning lady is coming. Make up. The cleaning lady is coming. Take up. The cleaning lady is coming. Rake up. The cleaning lady is coming. CLEAN up. The cleaning lady is coming.

        ALONE  .  A word that scares me more than any word in the english dictionary. And it scares me even more because the feeling of being alone has been visiting me quite frequently. Actually a lot frequently than I want it to. And it really REALLY scares me. I'm past the point of feeling sorry for myself. Sometimes I want to go lock myself into my room and cry my eyes out, but for some reason I can't. I can't cry because it's so far beyond crying. I just feel sad about it. And I'm not a sad person. I'm a happy, positive, optimistic person. And it makes me sick that I'm sad about being alone. After all, I'm not entirely alone- I have my family. But sometimes that just isn't enough. I want more.  Maybe if I had a boyfriend I wouldn't feel entirely alone. A guy that would be my boyfriend and my friend at the same time. A boyfriend that I could just hang out with and talk. I'm so sick of being alone. I'm ready to find that one person...mentally and emotionally. I'm ready for that person to find me. I hate waiting. It makes me sick. I don't want to be alone anymore. It's not that I need a boyfriend to make me feel better about myself..it's just that now is the perfect time for me to have one. I need one now more than ever...since the falling out with my little group of friends. I want someone to want me. I'm sick and tired of feeling alone, and it makes me sick that I can't do anything about it. All I can do is wait...

      A hippy guy walked past me and he saw his friend. His friend stops him and said, "Where are you going?" The hippy guy said "I go wherever the breeze takes me, man"  These are the people that make Sundown in the City interesting... Going where the breeze takes them...   Sundown was pretty fun. We were only there for a few hours though...we weren't really feelin' the bluegrass music. After that we ended up in numerous parking lots...Wendy's,Krystals, Wal-Mart, Ingles, St. John's, Weigel's. Yes..Knoxville is such a happening city.  We finally ended up at this guy Bama's house. Where I felt totally uncomfortable. Right as I walked into the rooom, there was an emormous confederate flag hanging on the wall. Yikes. So I just sat for a little while...acting like an awkward, shy little girl. As much fun as I was having sitting around and staring at Bama's collection of Confederacy items, I decided to go home around 1 A.M. And that was when I stayed up until 3 am sitting in my bed and staring at my ceiling and thinking.....  There are times when I feel as though I am so much older than some of my friends...and then I realize I am actually a year older than them. And maybe a year's a year..but a year difference makes a lot.  These girls do things like drink or smoke to make them seem like badasses. And maybe I did go through that phase, but I have grown out of it. I may drink from now and then but not to be like "Oh look at me I drink and smoke weed, I'm such a badass." And kids come on...you took  Caffeine pills .. not SPEED.  I don't know how to put what I'm feeling into words.  I think some people just need to  grow up .   So maybe going with the breeze isn't a good thing. Sometimes you need to turn around and go against the breeze, people. Don't be afraid to be who you are and be something else. Don't get lost in the crowd.

      Wow it's 9:11 in the morning and I'm awake. The things jet-lag makes you do! Well I am finally home in the good 'ol USA! and it feels so good to be  home ! We flew First Class like rock stars all the way to New Jersey and that was where my dad picked us up and we drove the rest of the way home. My mom's back is doing better. My dad took her in last night to get an MRI done and he couldn't find too much damage and she is at the doctor right now. Hopefully she won't have to have surgery. Last night I hung out with jennieee and we got pulled over because my tags were expired. But he was a nice and HOT cop and he let me go. That makes me happy.   I really don't have much to say...only that there's no place like home and the feeling of sleeping in your own bed! I have to call Ed Brantley today about working at the radio station. If I don't work there, I'm going to try to get a job with a news station..and if either of those don't work out..i'll just go work somewhere at the mall or something! bahg!  After living in India for a month, I have learned to be appreciative for all I have. Now I feel so guilty about complaining in the past. I will not complain anymore. I have food, shelter, clothes, friends, and a loving family. There's nothing else in the world I need.  I have everything I need and everything I want. I love my life. I love living my life.

      Hello! It's is exactly 8:00pm here in India..so that means it's probably sometime early in the morning in the U.S. My mom's back is still the same. She can get up to go to the bathroom but that's it. I feel awful because i can't do anything. Well my dad is looking into getting First Class tickets all the way home so my mom can fly comfortably or somewhat comfortably. She's def. going to have surgery when she gets back home. Now that all this has happened I'm SO glad that i decided not to do the Boston University thing. The $5000 that was going to go for that is now going to go for the first class tickets.   I am so incredibly ready to come home. I go to bed every night with an empty feeling in my stomach..aching to be back home. I have loved my stay here and have enjoyed every minute, but for once i'm starting to feel like that 10 year old girl that goes to Summer camp and gets homesick and calls her parents crying.."Mom, I wanna go home!!"  Sometimes, I feel so alone here. Even though i'm not- my mom, aunt, uncle, and cousin are all here. But I only know how to speak Bengali, and here they don't speak that..most people speak Hindi. SO most of the time i feel really left out and i feel like a dumb mute. It's frusterating because i can't do anything on my own. I couldn't even help my mom at the hospital cuz i couldn't converse with anyone there, my uncle and cousin had to do everyhthing. and it was really hard for me, so there in the hospital i had an emotional breakdown. it was bad. But it's okay, i'll be coming home soon ( hopefully). It's really sad here also. Poverty is everywhere. It's like poverty came and hit me in the face and gave me a bloddy nose. It's so depressing and it depresses me even more that I can't do anything about it. There's no compassion in the country. It's one man for his own here. Here it really is a dog eat dog world. If i could describe USA with one word it would be COMPASSION.  Jenna-I'm so sorry you're having to go through all that shit. I feel so bad that i can't be there for you. I love you girl and now that you are the best.  I would also like to thank a man named Bernie who did a small thing by writing a short uplifting e-mail, but meant so much to me. I'm all about the little things in life and that little thing made me feel so good!

      Hello! well yes i did get into the Boston University summer program, but i cancelled it. Due to the the fact that it's $5000 and my mom has her back problem right now..she's bedridden right now ( i don't feel like getting into that right now) but i also cancelled it because i've been away from home for so long that i've gotten really homesick, so it would erally suck having to go back home and then leave again. but ANYWAYS. I come home june 22nd. I'm still enjoying it here....but i'm just homesick. i miss my home. i miss my bed. i miss my shimmy. i miss my car ( haha) i miss my friends!   but i have to go now.  JENNAAAAAAAAAAAAAA is my friend.

Everything is revolves around living life, eating, food, music, and colors! I love it! and i'm living like a queen cuz there are servants and we have our own personal cook! But i must go..there is much to do! I will write more later when i have more time  I miss home! haha jenna is the only one reading this probably..so this one's for you jenna! I miss yoU!! You can talk to me about all the stupid stuff you want when i get back!  MUCH LOVE FROM THE LAND OF BROWN! A Part of the majority..no longer a minority. hahaha.

      Man boobies documentary is going pretty damn well.&nbsp; I think we should call it something else than Man BOOBIES, though...becuase we only get the hot guys to flash us none of those fat ugly gross men that really have man boobies. We can't call it man tits..ugh. I dunno...we'll have to brainstorm.&nbsp;It's kind of like a guys gone wild thing...&nbsp;Sometimes we have to explain that by saying that we want the guys to "flash" us, we mean we want to see their pecs...not their  family jewels ...guys seem to be confused by that.&nbsp; Some nights it's a total let-down though...I don't understand why some guys don't...you can walk around without your shirt on, but when you have a shirt on, it's hard for you to give a peak to some girls?&nbsp; And it's not like we're not hott enough...me and ren are pretty damn hott..haha. hmmm ok...but geeez! it's so frustrating sometimes!  Last night I think we got the best flash of our lives.&nbsp; It was at a gas station and WOW.&nbsp; Nice body.  VERY  nice.&nbsp; I had dreams about him last night. Wherever you are...I think I'm in LIKE with your body....  I thought this was funny from the other night...  Lauren: "I only want you from the waist up." David&nbsp; : " WHATTT?!?!?" Lauren:&nbsp;"Some girls just don't want the penis, David."  hahaha.

      I'm finding myself bored with everything lately. Bored with boys, bored with everyday, and just bored with life.&nbsp; I'm not depressed or sad by any means at all...just BORED.&nbsp; Maybe it's just a phase. I'm not used to being bored.&nbsp; I'm one of those people who have to constantly be entertained, it's really hard for me to sit around and do nothing.&nbsp; Maybe when I start my internship tomorrow at the radio station that will spice up my life. HOPEFULLY.&nbsp; I need something to keep me occupied.&nbsp; I even gave in to a babysitting job...and I don't like kids all that well.&nbsp;&nbsp;My boss for my promoting job&nbsp;at the radio station told me that most of his interns end up working at the radio station. So I thought that was pretty neat.&nbsp; We'll see tomorrow.&nbsp;   I found a Lexus IS300. It was beautiful.&nbsp; Slate gray and just oh so perfect.&nbsp; I need money.&nbsp; I need a job.&nbsp; I need that Lexus.   Oh, and I was right.&nbsp; All boys suck and they are all jerks.&nbsp;

        Holy Shit   is all I have to say. Soooo much has freakin happened.&nbsp; So I've been hanging out with an old friend lately..and so we decided to hang out last night..and as me and my old friend were "watching a movie", my mom decides to walk in on us.&nbsp; Yeah it was not the best of times in my house last night. But my mom's cool now.&nbsp; Aghhh how embarrassing. I'm scarred for life. Moms just aren't supposed to know those things about their daughters. I feel so bad for the guy, I think my mom scared the shit out him...cuz she&nbsp;can be a&nbsp;pretty scary lady.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Maybe I should&nbsp;take a break from all this...I don't want to say&nbsp;promiscuity..but it's something like that. I need to just be good again for a little while. Just sit back and kick it. I dunno.&nbsp; Easier said than done right?&nbsp; It's weird because I've found that lately when I get the thing I want, I don't want it anymore. Why is that?&nbsp; I guess I just want what I cant have, and when I realize that I can get it, I'm just over the idea of it and want to move on to something else. aghhhhhhh.

       Okay so I say I don't want a relationship, right? But does that mean I really don't? Or do I?&nbsp; I really think that sometimes I say things and think that if I keep saying them, then I will eventually start to believe them myself.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; I feel bad for guys. Girls are so damn confusing! I confuse myself!!  Actually, I think I don't want a relationship.&nbsp; I don't think I'd make a good girlfriend. I'm just so used to doing whatever the hell I want with whoever the hell I want, that having a boyfriend would be such a drastic change for me and I wouldn't know how to deal with it.&nbsp; I'm young, right? I need to live life.&nbsp; GAHHHh I hate it when I start thinking about these things. I shouldn't analayze every little thing. The thing is, I like this guy..a guy who I've been talking to for awhile...and he doesn't want a relationship because he works so much and what not. And it doesn't bother me...at least I don't think it does. Should it bother me? WHY AM I BEING LIKE THIS?! But I mean I guess if i liked him A LOT I wouldn't be wanting to do stuff with other guys...but I still do..So I guess I don't like him enough. SO it's a good thing for me and him both that he doesn't want a relationship. WHEW.

      It's not that i'm jealous of my cat...I  envy  my cat. I envy my cat's lifestyle. She just sits, sleeps, eats, walks, and gets treated like the queen of the house. What I would give. No worries on her mind. Well, I feel kind of bad because she got neutered, but oh well, she didn't need sex anyways, right? I like my cat. My cat's my favorite. Sorry shimmy. Cocoa could kick your ass anyday.  I'm such a loser. I need more interesting things to write about. My cat and dog just aren't going to cut it.

      So the stats on the  CAR CHALK  war is GIRLS:3  BOYS:1  Tonight was filled with driving around chasing and running from the boys. This war is getting scary. The shitty thing is that the boys are taking it out of hand. We were stopped on Parkside and we see Cody pull up behind us...Ian RUNS out of the car and pours sprite on my sunroof, thinking it would be open(luckily it wasn't) and then throws the can in the windows. GRRRRRRRRR. So our whole night consisted of WAR. this is full blown war, boys. watch your backs, or cars that is.  GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR I"M SO MAD!!!!! THE WAR IS JUST GETTING STARTED!

      okay. so yesterday was one of the shittiest days ever. and i don't even know why...that's what's bothering me. welll i did get into this really big fight with my mom..so that probably was what made my day so bad. The rest of the day I was just in a god awful mood.   So i went by and saw jeremy at work...it was frustrating because I couldn't talk to him that much and I couldn't even give him a hug or anything cuz he was working and he would get fired. and on top of that I wasn't having a good time there anyways so me and cynthia left at like 10.  And so of course me and jeremy were supposed to hang out today. guess who cancelled on me?? jeremy! Maybe that's the downfall of dating an older guy. He is just so damn busy with his work and school and shit. He works too much. He called me today and was like I just wanted you to know that you looked beautiful last night. I was like oookay how about lunch? And he's like yeah I have to go to Chattanooga for work, but I will take u out tomorrow..we'll see a movie. Damn jeremy. you suck. you really do suck. Maybe i'll just find someone else to take me out tonight...ha easier said than done.  my thoughts right now: fuck you, jeremy. fuck you.

      yes. well I was supposed to go to lunch with jeremy but he cancelled on me because he has to work. He felt really bad. gahh he works so much. oh well. We're supposed to go tomorrow..but we'll see about that..if he cancels on me or not. oh well. i'm not gonna be a girl about it. it's cool...he's a working mannn. I hope he's not one of those guys that you can't take his word for anything. That's one of my pet peeves. My dad used to always do that.  He would be like yay let's go car shopping! and i would get all excited and then after a little while he'd be like wait no..i'm tired. ah it pissed me off.  So i'm still unemployed. which sucks. I have no money and asking for money from my parents sucks. They're not used to me not having money. I've had a job every summer since i was 15, so they're like what? you don't have money? of course I don't have money..I Don't have a job!!! But today I'm going to go by some places and apply. gah. if they'll take me.

      I don't think I believe in the word love. Not at my age. Maybe when I'm older, but not now.  OKay so I try to think of myself as a happy, optimistic, friendly, blah blah.. person, so I guess it hurts me when someone calls me a bitch. I mean yes..i can be a bitch, but I'm only a bitch if you give me a reason to be. If you treat me like shit...well you know what I'm going to treat you like the bacteria that grows on shit. No I'll treat you like the bacteria's shit and I don't even know if bacteria takes shits..oh well. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I'm not a doormat. I'm not going to let everyone walk all over me. I personally think there's nothing wrong with being a bitch. Some of the coolest girls I know are bitches. Jenna and Ren are my favorite bitches. And it's not like we're constant bitches...we know when to turn our bitch switch on or off. You bitches rock. ha. This entry is dedicated to the fucker that called me a bitch. Thank you for the inspiration. But anyways. I must go clean. bitches.  Words to add to your everday vocabulary:   Grasspile ; ex: "That's not what your  grasspile  said last night."  Fond ; ex: "I'm  fond  of his insides..not outsides."  Fellatio ; ex: "While I was giving my boyfriend  fellatio  last night.."  Fuck ass ; ex: "Cody Brown is such a  fuck ass ."  Ahoy hoy ; Say that next time you answer the phone, like Ian does..it's so much better than saying hello.

      How come guys don't like to cuddle? I'm such a big fan of cuddling, but guys aren't. Making out and cuddling are soo much fun..but then the guy always tries to go down your pants. grrrr. I just want to cuddle sometimes! it's nice! I WANT TO CUDDLE.  cuddle is a really funny word if you think about it.

      I feel as though I'm at a point in my life where I feel so lost.  So lost about everything.  And it's really weird.  Sometimes I get caught up in my own thoughts that my thoughts are only what I see and hear and I really don't pay attention to what is going on around me.  I've had this empty feeling in my stomach (and no, it's not hunger) for the past week and I don't know what it is. Maybe I just don't know what sadness is.  I sat up waiting for his phone call...and when he did call it didn't even light up anything.  I wasn't sad about that.  I don't know what I'm sad about.  And it really bothers me because I usually have a specific reason of why I am sad.  It's scary that I don't know.  The feeling won't go away.  I've never really been too good with my sadness, I guess.  Correction- I've never been too good at  expressing  my sadness.  And I guess thats a good thing. But sometimes I guess it could be a  bad thing. I don't know.   I hope to be seen as a happy and optimistic person, because that is what I am 99% of the time.  Even if I'm upset about something, I usually don't let it show.  I don't know why that is.  I need to freakin get over this sad and alone feeling.  It's making me sick and ant-social.  It's making me a different person that I don't want to be.  I still want to be the same happy person as I've always been.     I don't know what to think of myself half the time.  Don't misunderstand. I am   NOT   depressed by any means.  Everyone goes through a period of sadness and I think it's just my time.  And I'm not doing the whole take pity on me deal either.  I don't need other people's pity.  I just need to get over this stupid sadness feeling. It's just a point in my life where I'm starting to think about everything: my future, my past, my relationships (that have been non-existant), dumb-ass things I've done, EVERYTHING.  I've been over analyzing everything about myself.  And it needs to stop.  I just need to sit back and breath for a little bit.

      Well, I realized that I was getting pretty bad at updating, ALAS! here I am...sitting in front of my computer at almost 2:00 in the afternoon in my jammies UPDATING!  The other day I was taking my dad's clothes to the dry cleaners and I was crossing the road...right next to me there was a mother and her son.  He had to be about 5 or 6 and as they were crossing the road she told her son, "Now, you have to hold my hand when we cross." And the little kid throws a fit. He did NOT want to hold her hand.  It was so weird because here I was almost 18 and   I   could cross the road by myself without having to hold anyone's hand.  But at one point, I was like the little kid...having to hold my mom's hand whenever I cross the road.  It was just so weird to think of that in a different perspective.  Soon that mother will have to let go and let that kid cross the road by himself one day, as I was.  It's just so crazy.  How does it happen so fast?  Where is that fine line where you stop holding on to your mother's hand to cross the road?  There were two kids at the mall...one dressed as spider man and the other as bat man and they're running around, because they're kids it's okay...but if I did that...I would probably be taken up by the police.  When did this happen?  When did we grow up?  It must be so weird for parents to see their children grow up in front of their very eyes.  It's amazing. It boggles my mind.
