        Political Debate          based on my latest anti bush thing, my friend responded with this  omfg....i cannot stand people too young to care about this talking like that. first off. Irag never attacked us, and bush did say they had WMDs but that wasnt the only reason we fought...theres this small thing called genocide (were you kills millions because you pretty much dont like somthing about them) in iraq. Osama bin laden did attack us on sept 11, 01 and so that gave us the right to attack him...now if anyone says we shouldnt have attacked iraq because there genocide isnt our problem is stupid, Although it wasnt affecting us they are still people and deserve to live with out being hsot in the night time...that gave us the right to attack Iraq. and if u say it wasnt... u must think that the holocust was somthing we shoulda let fly by.  "its better to die on your feet, than to live on your knees."  well i responded with this  well that wasent nice (no eprops) but as i have said, many times, we had no  urlLink legal resons for war with iraq . i do not believe we had the right, or purpous to attack iraq, and by the way, the holocost and iraq are two different things entirley, sadam decided that was the way to run his country, thats the way dictoatorships work, now hitler, he decided to take over the world, and kill millions of jewish people, inlcuinding those of the countries he deciced to take over, hitslers plan was to take over the world, sadam just wanted to run his own contry! yes sadam was evil, but NO it was not our responcibilty to take care of him!just becuase we are the usa that does not give us the right to invade a nation for oil, yes  urlLink OIL , what the hell was it supposed to be for? to free the iraqi people? for  urlLink WMD'S ? NOPE actualy we dident free anyone, we forced a new goverment on them, that they may or may not have liked. we puprpoulsy diliberatly attacked  urlLink Civilion Targets , where civilions had to die! the official reson for war was for, and i say it for hopefuly the last time  urlLink WMD'S  absoulty none were found at all, and even if they DID have wmd's they couldent attack us! iraq has a very poor  urlLink missle program  and none of them would be able to reach the us anyways! it was not to free the iraqi civilions, actualy it hurt (this link contains graphic image of blood and viloence, viewer decretion is advised)  urlLink them  sadom also did not know, or had no links to  urlLink terrorists  so he was absolutly no threat to us! btw that has nothing to do with what im talking about, the war wasent about freeing iraqis, it was about (oil) but officialy we were looking for those darned wmds, but none were found during those un searches, they say, uhhh man theres no wmds here, so what does  urlLink bush  say? " urlLink Bring it on " and what abot that  urlLink patriot act  we have turned into a  urlLink dictatorship!  we dont get out basic rights if we are accused of being a terrorist or a possible harm to our country, even if we dident to it!  urlLink they  can search your home, you dont have the right to a trial anymore, do you? NOPE! do you have the right to talk to your family? no you dont! you just  urlLink rot in jail  for doing nothing! what does bush do on 9/11 whyle out country is under attack? he  urlLink reads!   urlLink a secirity official tells him "our nation is under attack"  what does he do? hop into action, get on plaining? nope he  urlLink reads  for a few more minutes! and on that last note, i believe we should  urlLink impeach  bush, he does not deserve to be our president! sean roberts  please click on all the links (things in a different color, i think orange), they are real

      Well, uhhh if you want to know why I haven't posted, its because uhhh nothing has happened, I reached 1000 posts on g4ttv boards though....  urlLink http://fourms.g4techtv.com  uhh I stared at my computer, did some stuff with my server.. played games watched tv, boring, starting school so il talk about that later! lets see, my job is to complain so I will start! ok im going to hononegah high school! It’s a wonderful school were in debt! we decided to build a 2 million or so dollar bubble, when we had NO money!! since i was a freshmen last year, we had 3-4 bomb threats! i lost count now instead of getting us out, like any other school, hononegah said hey! lets move them to a possible safe but large area of the school! who cares about they’re safety! and those were the lucky times, usually we would keep going on with normal school because they didn’t think it was dangerous enough for us. a short time in the school year, all the teachers decided to go on strike! why? Payroll cuts? unsafe working area? nope. the teachers did not want the option to have the option to have one less hour, yes you heard me right, they had a optional one less prep period, they didn’t want that option, so there goes a 3 week strike! so it was fun, but, well we stayed in on our few breaks, and got a lot less summer break as well... now when there’s a fire alarm, no one knows what’s going on, I ask, they say uhh I dunno.  maybe school officials should know? so after the many other problems, it was near the end of the school year... we were out of money and in debt, we tried too pass a referendum to get some money, well no one wanted to pay a extra 5 cents on they’re taxes because they can almost buy gum, if they save up for a few months! So now parking is about $200.00 I think, drivers ed is about the same, everything will cost a lot as well.  the school also can not afford the power bill.. my school cut study hall and I get about 30 mins extra sleep! Well that’s all for this entry, talk to you later! wait, before i go... take a look at this... i think it looks like a jail! my school!
