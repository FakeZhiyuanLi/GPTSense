       Features of a Depressive Episode  Persistent sad, anxious, or empty mood  Feeling helpless, guilty, or worthless  Hopeless or pessimistic feelings  Loss of pleasure in usual activities  Decreased energy  Loss of memory or concentration   Irritability or restlessness  Sleep disturbances  Loss of or increase in appetite   Persistent thoughts of death     Features of a Manic Episode    Extreme irritability & distractibility  Excessive "high" or euphoric feelings   Sustained periods of unusual, even bizarre, behavior with significant risk-taking  Increased energy, activity, rapid talking & thinking, agitation   Decreased sleep   Unrealistic belief in one's own abilities   Poor judgment   Increased sex drive   Substance abuse   Provocative or obnoxious behavior   Denial of problem   (http://www.psychologyinfo.com/depression/bipolar.htm)  Yes- I am Bi-polar. I have lost my personality because of it because the way I act is because of the disorder. Make sense? Well, unfortunately, I am going through the depression part of it right now and it has paralyzed my life. I can't get up to go to school, I just want to sleep and keep all the doors and windows closed. I cry over stupid shit and I think weird stuff. I can't remember shit or focus on anything. I just want the world to go away and wait til I'm better- but that is an unreasonable thing. I see the doctor Friday so he can add Prozac to my daily Lithium ritual. That's tha part I hate- I gain weight or have a weird reaction and have to keep trying to get the right stuff and there are still all kinds of weird side effects- headaches, dizzy spells, nausea, weird dreams, tremors. Fuck- I hate my life.

      I so remember what I was going to say before but forgot.... I am looking for a new (new to me) car and I came across and ad for a 1972 Cadillac El Dorado. The ad says - convertible, former Laker selling his toy- blah blah blah- $10,000/obo 310-521-0330. I really wanna call but not to buy the car cause Lord knows I will never have 10 grand in my hand at once.... but I just wanna see who it is. LMAO I know this post is pointless- but my time would only be wasted in other ways so I might as well entertain myself. Let's call that Laker guy!

      LMAO@Ponderance. I just got a phone call from a long time friend and I have been avoiding her phone calls for so long because she's all about drama and I don't have time for it. Well- she said she loved me on the message and the whole thing made me feel a little bad and childish but then again- I know why I'm acting the way I'm acting. I am simply avoiding the bullshit that I don't need in my life. So my ponderance is- shall I or shall I not call....... Another thing- there is a VERY nice guy who I met in school and he no longer goes there but he's ALOT older than me and he is very interested in getting to know me but the age thing really poses an issue with me. He's very nice and good looking and obviously (if he likes me) he has his head on straight...LMAO! Just kidding. I like him and am interested in getting to know him but unwilling to make the time for him (or anybody for that matter). I might miss out on a good thing...... I got a prank call this morning. I think I know who it is because the only fucker who is immature enough (even at 36) to prank call me at the crack of dawn is RAY. Hmmm. I wonder if it could be. I KNOW it could be. Fag.  My back hurts.  I'm hungry for some fattening food (i.e. Burger King) Today in group, Jo*** was getting on my nerves. She is too much. She is rude, loud, obnoxious, a tweaker, a user, and she irritates me. I am thinking of complaining because I am there for a reason and I am beginning to think that I am the only damn one.  Grrrr. I'm going to go.

      To pass the time I decided to write an entry. See, I haven't written in a while because I have an uninteresting life! I do the same thing every day.  Yesterday, however, I had a nice time after school. I went to Thelma's and we and 2 of her kids went to Yoshinoya for dinner. We ate chicken and rice and Thelma had a side of Hello Kitty. It was delicious. We went back and got on the internet for a while and then I went home. Now that I think about it and read what I wrote- I realize that my day won't sound that exciting to most people- and that just proves how boring my life is.  I wonder if what I was waiting for is ready to be read yet. Hmmmm.... I wrote a poem that I would like to share with you.  Dear Mr Block-  Fanatical infiltration plagues me Damn near daily However I'm on some other shit Keeping my guard up My vulnerability in tact Waiting for the truth Truth So I can write a fuckin poem For everyone's ear  to hear My hands are petrified And my mind is bemused  blank And for some damn reason My heart produces no ink And no man fabricates inspiration  My pen has since dried my paper now a relic I can't read poetry I can't hear poetry And fuck!  I can't write poetry I curse you Writer's Block!  The impedance you instigate I want my ability back So I don't have to write to  Your  ass anymore  Peace & Poeticness, Poet

      This is obviously my first post and so I guess I should take this time to introduce myself to you all. My name is Michele and people close to me call me Chele and people who respect my talent call me or refer to me as Crazy Poetic. I am a poet and I am currently working on a book- hopefully it will be published in early 2005. I've been working on it for three years so far and have almost 80 poems that will be included in it. I've been currently doing spoken word and posting my audios on a website that I frequent. It's exciting to be expanding my art.  I'm 25 years old and I have a son, Hayden Nethaniel, who is 9 years old. His father has only seen him once or twice and chooses not to be in his life. It's fine- because that way- we don't have to deal with him! My son and my poetry are my life! I think of only those two things all day long.  I live in Bakersfield, California and I hate it! I wish that I could get the resources and the strength to move. Bakersfield is known to many as a trap. You come here or you're born here - and you never leave. Who knows the reasons- but I am a victim.  I'm single. Partly by choice and partly due to the fact that there is no one that I have met worth my admiration! I'm seeing someone but who knows where that will lead. He easily irritates me and he's been cut off before- this is his last chance. LMAO Really- I'm not that mean. Well...maybe.  I have Bi-Polar disorder, also. I was diagnosed a few years ago but I've suffered from the symptoms since I was a child. My dad had it and it is thought to be genetic. I currently take Lithium and was also prescribed Zyprexa but that made me fat so I stopped taking it. Living with Bi-Polar disorder is hard because you seem to lose your identity. You begin to realize that you act the way that you act because of the disorder so you're left with "what is my REAL personality?". It's hard and exhausting- but I maintain my medication regimen and know the signs of the ups and downs and keep my doctor informed and updated on my progression and regression. I like to think that I am doing well.  My goal right now is to start classes at the community college in my city for jewelry making courses. Hopefully obtaining an AA in the process. My long term goal is to own my own business. I will complete the jewelry making classes and obviously do something with that but ultimately I want to open a poetry cafe. Poetry venues are pretty much non-existent in Bakersfield and I want to change that!  Let me take this time (and last paragraph) to tell you about my two best friends. My friend Rachel- she's been my friend for 11 years now and I love her very much and would do alot for her. We've had our hard times and I've seen her go through bad things and she's seen me go through bad things. We've supported each other and we knoew pretty  much everything there is to know about each other. She enjoys my poetry and encourages me to write and take it as far as it will go. That means alot to me- and I think that has alot to do with why we are still friends. I have some negative feelings toward her right now because I feel very strongly that she is dealing with her problems in the wrong way. But I figure- she is 25 years old, with 2 gorgeous children-she'll find the way. And if she can't find it on her own- I'll most likely be there to help her find it. Thelma- I met her at school 2 months ago and what a wonderful asset to my life she has become! She's also a poetic princess and she has 3 kids that are so funny and beautiful! We have alot in common and I can see our friendship going very far! We were discussing today going to college for jewelry making and maybe starting a business together! I LOVE HER!!! In computer class we never do our work. We just look at poetry sites on the internet, write poems, listen to music and talk about people. Memorial Day weekend Hayden and I went over to her house and we had so much fun! We ate pizza and the kids played dress up and acted silly and we played on the phone and bullshitted. It's been a long time since I could relax at someone else's house like that. I look forward to doing that alot with her and our kids. Ok- now that I introduced the HELL outta myself- I will bring this first entry to a close. I hope you plan on keeping an eye out for me and feel free to check out my poetry!  Peace & Poeticness!   urlLink
