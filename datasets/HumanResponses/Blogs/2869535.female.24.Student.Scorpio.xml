      OK, everyone needs to be on the lookout! HotKimmy called me this morning crying and screaming that her baby is gone! Someone done snuck in and stole her baby! So be on the lookout for him. He's about a foot tall, and wearing a diaper. He will give you the finger if you look at him wrong, and he answers to "Rupert".

      This is Dirty Sanchez. He used to be white, as in this picture, but since he never bathed, he was pretty brown. He was also very, very fat. Rest in peace, my rabbity friend. My fat, fat rabbity friend.   urlLink     Posted by Yossarian

      So today Kim and I were walking our pet rabbit dirty Sanchez in the park...you know...on a rabbit leash. And Kim had this willllddd idea. She says to me...she says "you know what....lets take dirty Sanchez for a swim in that pond over there..." and before I could remind her that he is on a leash she was already to the pond. Well...kimmy can't swim so she just kinda let the rabbit go in while she was still holding on to its leash....well....poor dirty Sanchez didn't make it....he was floating.... So I had to go into the dirty pond and get dead dirty Sanchez out....AND I had to carry a dead rabbit all the way back to our trailer since Kim was crying so bad.... then we had to leave the rabbit on the front step and wait till everyone was sleeping bc we aren't suppose to bury animals at the trailer park.... so....Never take a rabbit on a leash for a swim.

      This is Hot Kimmy's boyfriend. He's drinking a beer and laughing about something. He is laughing about the fact that he got so drunk he drove his car right on top of his house.  urlLink     Posted by Yossarian

      Hi. This is another friend of Hot Kimmy's. She called me this morning at 4:30am and said this:  "And I did not shit my pants yesterday - that little slut is telling lies about me. She shit her pants and then asked me to switch pants with her, not telling me about the shit. So we switched pants, and as I pulled them on I noticed the poop, but by that time she was running away, dirtying up my nice clean pants with her shitty behind."   Who is "she"? Well, "she" is Victoria, a little slut friend of Hot Kimmy's. She is constantly doing shit like this to Hot Kimmy, apparently. Why do we hang out with her? We do it because she is the only one we know with a crystal meth hookup.

      Well today I was out with Kim and she really had to take a shit...there was nowhere to poop so she decided to go in some near by woods....well....kimmy was wearing white pants...and well lets just say there was a little brown mess on them....it was nasty...and i made her ride in the back of my pick up truck because i didn't want and dookie on my seat...and i didn't wanna smell it.  moral of this story .....don't wear white pants and always carry toliet paper.

      well...this blog is all about kim...written by someone else. Who it is written by you will never know...but i will tell you everything that goes on in the beautiful kimmy's life. The other day, Kim was hit by a car....it was tragic...but funny. She didn't get hurt or anything....it was some old woman driving....really slow....well....this woman needed new glasses....and when she hit kim she got out of the car and asked if the cat was ok. SO i was like "hey lady, that was no cat! That was my friend!" She was a little upset...then she went into how they would send her back to the old folks home if we told on her. So...we let her run wild and free...but we did make her promise to buy new glasses. So we got her number and we called her the next day....welll....she answered and she was breathing all heavy so i was like Mildred...whats wrong...and this old lady...like 80 years old....started telling me how she was having sex w the lawn man. I was like "Mil, how old IS he? She told me 50...."so i says to Mildred, I says Mildred....thats just nasty..he is young enough to be your son" so she says to me she says....WELL I am paying him well and tipping him!" So needless to say....kimmy got hit by an old granny perve. more to come later....
