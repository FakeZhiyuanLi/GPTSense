						    I've seen a number of incidents of ppl giving up their seats to other ppl who need it more than them... Well, it's actually quite consoling...that we're not that bad after all... Well, the feeling of doing that is just too gratifying...   Kindness begets kindness...   well actually the satisfying feeling u acquire after that is good enough... haha.. Well then again, giving up ur seat... there're 2 perspectives u can look at it from- "wow very kind of him..." or "omg...how dumb of him giving up his chance of resting his legs..." just hoping that most ppl do not have the latter thinking...   There are two sides to everything... Choose to look at the brighter side, and your life will naturally be a little happier...   guess thats all...    &nbsp;   But&nbsp;thou really hope a positive response is being transmitted... Heartbroken&nbsp;thou shall be if it is the reverse...

						    well my chemistry teacher hates this word.. =/ You can ask her why...but just dun tell her shes nice... coz wrath will befall on u... use some other synonyms... =) Oh well, wad would u do if u experience (touchwood) the demise of a loved one, or if ur b/gf ditches/rejects u? Certainly u'll feel bad...perhaps miserable... but dun throw urself&nbsp;into that state of despair for a long time...not wise...   Time heals all wounds...   just live on a normal life... coz u'll hafta pick up urself one day... so...y not like as soon as possible? get some yield out of wad u do, and not let liquified fungus be found on a rotting u... Speaking of bgr, when can u tell a boy/girl likes u~? Is   letting nature take its course   the best solution~? well its for u to find out, for im no professional in this field of knowledge...    &nbsp;   Time flies... People change... Feelings change too... This never-ending torment/joy will continue to haunt/stay on with humans for as long as eternity lasts...

						    Physics SPA today...sux big time...damn retort stand...i really think its the retort stand...the clamp that is...oh well... nvm...   A good worker never blames his tools...   =/ well its over...guess its ok now... lolw.. as we proceed on in life, we find that we face more difficult challenges... (duh~) well just take it as grooming u into an adult...or preparing for greater challenges in life... (-_-")   Do not despair when encountered with a difficulty... Take it as a lesson, an experience, for you to handle such problems appropriately in the future...   Remember,   life is full of ups and downs... So don't expect your life to be smooth-sailing all the time...     If you can't make it, try try again... Dun worry... Be happy...      &nbsp;   I'm getting from bad to worse... The world is getting brighter by the minute, and the people around me are getting smarter by the second... I don't literally mean this...

						    Theres a chinese saying: "Qian li zhi xing, shi yu zu xia." Translated, "  A journey of a thousand li   (a chinese unit of measurement...similar to yards?),   starts with ur feet  ." or wadever it is...basically means that in order to be successful, u needa start off small?? then there're other chinese proverbs too...like, "ben niao xian fei", meaning stupid birds fly first... doesnt literally mean that... it means that   since u are lacking behind, u shld do something to catch up with the rest of the gang...   hmm...wad else... and this one, "liang hu xiang dou, bi you yi shang", translated, "  when 2 tigers fight, there'll be at least 1 injured  "... well... if 1 gives in? maybe the fight wouldn't have happened.. but then again whos so magnanimous to do so... u'll juz be bullied and mocked for it... not worth it, so to speak...i guess thats about what i remembered from my chinese class today.. lolw... oh ya...  Life is beautiful with the many sights and sounds... Treasure them, and not waste them, nor restrict them... If one day you lose either your sense of hearing or sight (touchwood), you'll fall into deep regrets...          &nbsp;   Weeks passed... Nothing seems to have changed... Should I wait and see? I know I can't take any actions now... I know for sure... Oh well... Life's beautiful... = )

						     Another long day has passed... phew~ so darn tiring... well, i gotta put thru all these, since      you reap what you sow...   Well i dun really trust that statement...i guess ppl around me will noe y... not boasting but er... if u analyse wad i do everyday, u'll noe y i say that... =P anyways, like every friday, proj work at the end of the day... well...in the middle of the whole process already...must perservere... it really feels good to see the GPF thicken as the weeks go by... to achieve good results for pw, its just like being   a man who wants to move a mountain but starts off by moving small stones...   Lil' stories, everyday... Everyone has their own story to tell... and each of their story in unique in different ways... Laugh? yea laughing is good... so they always say   laughter is the best medicine...   guess its true... pw has been made an enjoyable experience by it... at times, laughter enables us to advance... oh well, keep smiling~!    &nbsp;   Getting it? I'm not sure at all... When can I tell? I have to be vigilant then... Or I'll never know the answer...

						    Well different ppl have different characters, styles, attitudes, etc... When it comes to learning style, it shld be left to the student to decide... Or at least thats wad i've always thought... And apparently some teachers have some problems with that... All teachers are the same... They always think that their method of studying is the best... well with the exception of some tchers... Hey,   everyone is unique in their own ways... If you change your personality because of some trivial reasons, then I really don't think you shld continue calling yourself by your name...   wad continues on? BGRs always cause ppl to change their personalities just to "pacify" their partners... what for? then he/she doesn't really like u, coz she likes ur changed personality, and that wasnt from u...originally... then again,   love is blind... Sometimes love can't be explained... Love is a complex structure in which many people gets themselves trapped...   what a burden...what a joy?    &nbsp;   Still cant forget... wait...juz started how to forget... oh well... it'll last for as long as i start losing hope... which wun be that soon...i think...

						    Yea... Another day... How boring can life be... Well it depends on how u look at it...&nbsp;  To everything ,&nbsp; there's always a good side and a bad side to it  ... However, ppl always chooses the latter and often land themselves in despair...&nbsp;what can i say.... nth to say... Often, we give up when faced with difficulties... Wisdom states that we shld come up with solutions and not avoid it...   Reality is there and there... There is no use running away from it...  &nbsp;Thats the truth...but many a times ppl cant accept it... Brooding over past mistakes and not learning from them... Failure to advance further in life... Self-pitying in every problem encountered... why bother existing...   Be it happy or sad, still we have to live on... So why choose the latter? Live life well and enjoy life...   Life is short... we ain't got much time left on earth... how daft to not make use of the chance to create exhilarating moments in the scarcity of time... though fate and destiny has it all in for us, we can do but little things to help improve/enhance whatever we're experiencing...on this lonely planet...or this iridescent world...    &nbsp;   The little secrets... It's meant for someone to find out... But will it be known by the correct person? Guess I'll never know... Fate has it planned already...and I am waiting for astonishing moments patiently...

						   We dun cherish wad we have huh... well thats quite true for most cases... ppl take for granted wad they have with them currently and dun quite cherish them...not till they lose them... but how exactly do u show appreciation for wad u have now??? thats one big question...or maybe it isnt... =/   Treasure your loved ones while they are still around... Everyone has to go one day... It only depends on when it is their turn... Don't regret when one leaves, nor land yourself in despair, for it is done by one with no absolute wisdom... Live a happy life... Live with wisdom...     It all depends on destiny anyways... So I'll let nature take its course for now... But hopefully I'll be bestowed with a positive response...
