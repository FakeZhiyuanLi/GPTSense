        im warning you now if you dont want to possibly cry then dont read these...    ~When all the parts of the puzzle start to look like they fit... Then I must remember there'll be days like this   -Oh, love is real enough, you will find it some day, but it has one arch-enemy - and that is life. -- Jean Anouilh, Ardele   ~I know someday you'll have a beautiful life.I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky but why, why, why can't it be, oh, can't it be mine?   -There is only one happiness in life,to love and be loved   ~you said you never wanted to see me get hurtsoo did you just close your eyes when you made me cry?   -you asked what was wrong, i smiled and said nothing...then you turned away, a tear fell down my face and i wispered, everything   ~it takes someone special to make you laugh...   but it takes someone really special to make you laugh   when you have tears in your eyes   -You learn to like someone when you find out what makes them laugh, but you learn to love someone when you find out what makes them cry.    ~tears are words the heart cant say   -i walk in the rain . . swim in the pool . . i pretend im sleeping    soo noone notices that im really crying cuz of you   ~i'll be smiling when i see you    The tears wont ever show    i know i'll always love you    And yet you'll never know    -Take the blinders from your eyes, take the padding from your ears, and confess you've seen me crying, and admit you've seen my tears     ~I'm trying really hard not to cry over you cause every tear is just one more reminder that I don't know how to let you go     -Inside I’m slowing dying but the rain will hide my crying    ~The weirdest thing happend to me the other morning...I woke up with tears in my eyes....and one rollling down my cheek...and I knew I must have been dreaming of you again.    -have you ever had that empty feeling` inside of you...   ..like no one cares or loves you back feeling,    as if you would of c r i e d .. no one -    would be there to wipe away the *tears*    ~ I couldn’t help it when I started to cry      I told myself life’s a lie      You know love sucks when your dreams slip away      I’d trade all my tomorrows for one yesterday    -Life goes on the same, bury the pain    And hold on to love    Hear the song, sing along    But what does it change    Oh this life is so confusing    Feels like I'm always losing    ~*Let me ruin your life, let me break your heart, then I'll ask you why we can't be friends. Let me rip your world into little pieces, let me destroy who you thought you were, and then I'll ask if we can be friends*    -Does it hurt when you think about me   And how broken my heart is?   ~now im drowning in a sea of salt sorrow    wishing that id never fallen in love with you    hoping that tomorow there will be no sorrow

      I know that other post was kinda depressing and im sorry if i made any of you sad or w/e but i dunno it just helped me to get it kinda outta my system... ttyl love ya more than you know, ............... well here are some more 'up beat' ones...  The real test of friendship is: Can you literally do nothing with the other person? Can you enjoy together those moments of life that are utterly simple? They are the moments people look back on at the end of life and number as their most sacred experiences.  As I lay awake last night Contemplating the day just passed Suddenly you popped into my mind I said, “This thought won’t last” But the clock kept ticking Hour after hour You were still on my mind With so much power Why was I thinking of you? Why were you on my mind? I’m not really sure The answers I want to findA friend you are to me This I’ll always treasure How much I’ve thought of you lately I just could not measure  If it weren't for you, where would I be? I truly do not know But I just hope you all can see Each day, our closeness grows You cheered me up with smiles Or hugs filled up with love And as the time goes by, every day.. You're the ones I'm thinking of Of course when many years go by We'll remember all the times. When we encountered crushes, parties, break-ups, pick-up lines. All of those make up the memories of true best friends And now I know deep in my heart Our trust will never end.  You are what a friend should be Someone honest and someone true You've always been there to lend a shoulder Whenever I've been feeling blue. You've been there to make me laugh When I am not in a good mood You're so kind and considerate So polite and never rude You've been there when I need advice Whether its about family or boys We've known each other since we little kids Since kinder when we used to play with toys. We might not have grown up together But we become closer each day You've been part of making me the person That I am today. Thank you for being there For always being by my side over n over again You all mean the world to me Cause you are my best friends.  With clothes the new are best, with friends the old are best.  True friendship is like sound health, the value of it is seldom known until it be lost.  A friend drops their plans when you're in trouble, shares joy in your accomplishments, feels sad when you're in pain. A friend encourages your dreams and offers advice--but when you don't follow it, they still respect and love you.  A true friend is one who overlooks your failures and tolerates your successes.  When a friend is in trouble, don't annoy him by asking if there is anything you can do. Think up something appropriate and do it.  A friend is one who knows us, but loves us anyway.  My best friends are the ones who bring out the best in me!  Friendships begin because, even without words, we understand how someone feels.  The human race has one really effective weapon, and that is laughter.  A friendship can weather most things and thrive in thin soil--but it needs a little mulch of letters and phone calls and small silly presents every so often--just to save it from drying out completely.  To be capable of steady friendship or lasting love, are the two greatest proofs, not only of goodness of heart, but of strength of mind.  A friend is a person with whom I may be sincere. Before him (or her), I may think aloud.  okay well i think thats enough for now...love and miss you guys tons! Caitlin

      some of these i just copied from other places and some of them i altered a little bit...but i thought they kinda expressed how i feel, so here they are...  Why do I feel so sad and lonely, even though I've got friends? Why do I feel that no guys like me, even though I had a boyfriend? Why do I feel so ugly, when I know that looks mean nothing? Why do I hate myself so much, when I dont know what there is to hate about me? Why do I feel like everyone else hates me, when I know it's only a certain few? Why do I feel so much pain, even when I'm happy? Why can't I let him go, even when he has already let me? Why do I feel this way?  I love you now, I always will You're my best friends. The times we spent together Will never leave my memory. I hate it that you're so far away And every time, I had to say goodbye. I thought it would get easier But it never did. I know you cry for me, But not as much as I cry for you. Remember, you're the ones I come to you for advice, I need you though you're far away And I will always love you xXx  I found out i was moving I told you all I cried for hours knowing i was leaving all my friends behind I know you didn't believe me but when that day came you cried for hours knowing it was real I Wasn't sure how i was going to live my life in a different state Knowing there were new people to face Now all we have is a phone no more going to each others houses for a day I miss the good old days Of everyone so happy knowing i would be there forever but not realizing that i really wasn't going to be. but thats ok because i know i have you! I got in the car that day and all i thought about was all of you!!!! This is dedicated to all my friends who live in California  I was always really happy Spending time with youI thought you really liked me But I guess that wasn't true You said you'd call me back So I waited by the phone But you went out with your friends And left me all alone So I waited for a week And still you never called The day I found out we broke up I became appalled You told your friends you dumped me But you didn't let me know Since you and I are over I guess I'll just go with the flow I need to just move on To change around my life To find another person We need to end this strife There is no more us That point has been known I hope that I find someone else I hate to be alone  Me and him are completely done, But sometimes I find myself missing him and wishing we were one, He was my first, but not my last, For everything that is good must pass, Life does not go on forever, And we must do everything in our power to make our time here better, Now im on my path to someone else once again, Hopefully this time I wont feel pain, Now I feel a droplet of light rain, The storm is coming quick and fast, All feeling is gone the moment has passed.  Letting gothen moving on its the hardest part it takes so long.. forgetting the love the memories and all forgetting the times you shouldnt recall the memories bring tears the tears they flow you dont want to remember its so hard to let go! its so hard to move on and forget everything youd take him back you'd give anything! just for him to hold you.. to kiss you, and love you you miss his smile.. you just want him to hug you.. its moving on that hurts the hardest part of all.. but luckily your friends are always there to catch you when you fall!

      well i didnt go to bed until like one this morning cuz...well i really dont know why. anyways, i woke up at like eleven when my brother was banging on my door tellin me that my mom said i had to get up, i wasnt too happy about it.  so then my mom tells me to get dressed cuz we gotta go get josie some stuff for her birthday and then we went to leave but my mom, being soo bright, left a light on in the car last night. so the battery was dead. so she decided i would sit in the car and she and my brother would push it out of the garage and to the bottom of the drive way and i would stomp on the brake when it got too fast. gah. i didnt like my first 'experience behind the wheel' but im gunna drive sooner or later... but wow it scared me. so then we went and got josie some balloons and some school supplies, hmm just what i always wanted for my seventh birthday! so then we got back to the house and my mom was like ah shit we gotta get danny in the car and his car seat, cuz she told my older brother she would take him to the 'party' if he gave daniel a bath and so i said 'its not my fault you told james that' and she got sooo pissed and yea you dont need to hear all about that...so we finally got to caleb's house and he opened the door and said what do want? and shut the door, what an idiot...so then we watched finding nemo, (soo many memories of water polo season.) while our moms went shopping for food or something...and then we started watchin texas chainsaw massacre but only got like five minutes into it before they got home and so we all were gettin crap outta the car and i went back and my mom said that if i wanted food(i hadnt eatin all day and it was like 4) then i had to go home or i could just stay there and eat when they got the bbq set up.  but i was hungry and so we ended up leaving and now im here...tellin you what ive done today... okay im done...

      well today was an 'A' day i guess it was better than wednesday, but still not very comforting. i had a really bad headache all day and to add to the pain of that my back was killing me from carrying like ten pounds of book in my back pack and sitting in the weird chairs that are completly different from the ones that i got used to at MMHS. anyways, at lunch i was sitting at the table i have sat at everyday so far and it got really crowded for some reason and a guy at the table in from of me pushed his backpack on to the ground and it like hit my feet and he looked at me and i looked at him and went back to reading and a girl at that table, im assuming it was one of his friends kinda pissed me off. she said in a really bitchie tone 'why the hell is she reading at lunch? god, i just hate the kinda of people who do stuff like that.' argg i wanted to just yell 'STFU you f***ing rude bitch'...but i kept calm and acted as if i hadnt heard her, arent you proud? the rest of the day went okay though as far as people and the classes went. we had our first lecture in history, watched a pottery movie in ceramics, took a diagnostic test in biology (i didnt know  any of it , it looked familiar but i didnt remember it from seventh grade) and in english i read the summer reading book that i didnt know i would have to read and all the other people were writing their AP essays... kinda awkward but whatever works, right? well im gunna go now, maybe i will post on my xanga, maybe not... love ya and ttfn(tatafornow) Caitlin
