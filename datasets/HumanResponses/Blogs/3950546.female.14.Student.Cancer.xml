         Hello again Lou.  urlLink I miss you , please come back.~ urlLink Snifflez ~ The  urlLink oldest one  is watching a video out in the lounge room at the moment. She is watching  urlLink Love Actually.  I thought she may like it, it is a nice movie. I went out there before though and she was sound  urlLink asleep  sitting there.~Laughs~ So...no doubt she will not let on that she was asleep and say the movie was either good or bad.  urlLink Bless her !    The  urlLink Biggest one  is outside  urlLink working on his car  I think. Doing something boyish anyway.~ urlLink Rollz eyes ~. Me, well, I am bored actually.    So you have gone  urlLink fishing  hey. Hope you and the boyz don't fall in and get eaten by any  urlLink nasty sea creatures . Ewww how horrid would that be. I wonder if ya  urlLink Dadda  would jump in and save you? Not long til ya  urlLink mum  arrives home from  urlLink Bali.  Bags full of goodies for all of us hopefully. She had better bring me back a  urlLink Bali hut  or I will be  urlLink pizzed off  I can tell you Lou.~Grinz~   Anyway Loua I will run away again and hopefully catch up with you later.   See ya, love ya.    &nbsp;  ~ urlLink Cartwheels out the door ~

        Hello Loua!  urlLink I'm  here having a look around to see if it may be the place for you chicky.~Smilez~ Now I am here I don't know what to write! OOh we had a good time at  urlLink lunch  yesterday hey. The great thing is that I can write about it on here and NO ONE will ever know about our secret lunch date. (Well no one but Rick,  urlLink the weazel )~Laughs~ Its Saturday morning 9.30 and I am sitting here listening to the gardening show on the radio, listening for some tips. The  urlLink old girl  is still in her room, I know she is awake as I heard her mulling around in there earlier, doing whatever it is that&nbsp;old people do in their rooms.~Chucklez~ The&nbsp; urlLink biggest one  is in his room also. He is playing on his pc inbetween doing his washing.&nbsp;He is all excited about&nbsp;the party tonight I think, looking forward to dressing up as a  urlLink pimp . Lets hope he finds himself a  urlLink HOE !~Laughz~ &nbsp;I don't know what to do today  urlLink Loua . I might play around with this for awhile, call you and tell you to get on and have a look. I cannot be bothered doing anything else. I feel a bit guilty already coz I am sure the oldest one will want to do something. I am sure she will be feeling a little better and be ready to get out and about. I have no  urlLink money  and cannot be bothered driving anywhere to do 'I don't know what' with her!~Sighz~ Oh well. Maybe I could rent her a  urlLink movie  to watch.(It will probably only put her to sleep). I don't know, makes me all uncomfortable just thinking about what to do to be honest.~Laughz~      I wish I could shoot! I wish I had a  urlLink gun ! Yes, that bloody  urlLink cat  from next door keeps trying to get  urlLink Henna . Three times yesterday it tried. Then this morning when I let her and Licken out the bastard was down the back skulking around. One shot is all it would take Loua. Ready....Aim....Fire.  urlLink One dead cat ! I am getting to the stage where I don't want to let them out of their cage. GGGGGrrrrrr. I will just have to get a  urlLink trap  and catch the horrid thing.      Anyway Loua that's enough to test this all out I think. I will publish and see how we go from there. Maybe we could get together today and add a few more things. I will need your help though I think.      Something to look @ urlLink http://www.mbayaq.org/efc/efc_smm/smm_cam.asp?bhcp=1            See ya, love ya.    &nbsp;    ~ urlLink Back flips out the door ~

      Hey avril haterz and booty shakerz! LOL Dont ask why I named my blog this, I guess its cos of my strong hate for Avril Lavigne, lol, its not just me that hates her skanky guts though, I was looking through the msn groups the other day and found heaps of Anti Avril army's, I even joined one! Yes, well enough the so called "punk" and more about me! (-: Well, my name is Alex and I live in the great country of Australia, where it's very hot, ~wipes her brow~, and no, I dont talk like Steve Irwin and have a pet Kangaroo. I am into all sports except tennis, cant stand it. I play soccer and netball, my positions are left wing, goalie and defense for soccer and I only started playing netball this year and am experimenting with all positions but my faves so far have to be GA and WA. I really like eminem, 50 cent, Chingy, Simple Plan, Outkast, good Charlotte, Avril Lavigne (just kidding), Evanescence but my favourite is Blink 182, they rock ma socks! Well, thats all I can think of right now, cyaz p.s. - its my bday on Tuesday! Cant wait!
