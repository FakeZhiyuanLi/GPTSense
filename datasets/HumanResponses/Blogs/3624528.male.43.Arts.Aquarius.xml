      &nbsp;About a year or so back, I wrote in another blog about the absurdity of the term/concept of  urlLink metrosexual . In that brief essay, I figured I semi-qualified: though&nbsp;semi-urban, I was somewhat interested in appearance (if only I could remember to get a haircut more than once every decade),&nbsp;I can make a mean Chicken Marsala, and pick a great wine to go with it, my house is MOSTLY clean and uncluttered...&nbsp;However, having 3 little ones definitely takes me out of the metrosexual running. Is that fair?  &nbsp;  As I wrote in that previous&nbsp;blog, who cares? I don't think Salon or GQ would find me very metro and not just because three little lovelies are tugging at the tail of my Versace shirt.&nbsp;The ability to fix&nbsp;a leak in a washing machine is probably not on the metro resume and you probably won't find replacing the clutch cable on a 68' Bug on there, either (much less doing a full tune-up). Making a pretty cool set of shelves out of scrap lumber is also not part of the metro mystique. Fops don't fix things and fops don't make things.  &nbsp;  Part of figuring all of this out is navigating this new identity. It's not something I asked for but it is something I have gladly taken on. I've always been for a new adventure and I have to hand it to my kids, they keep things interesting.  &nbsp;  Necessity has been the father of invention, as a single dad, and just like my children I'm learning by baby steps. “Google is my friend” (is my motto) and typing in “how to” along with ket symptoms of my problem always gets me a solution. Oxyclean is likewise my friend. Most importantly, I know what wine goes well with ironing (although I prefer beer -&nbsp;India Pale Ale - to be precise) and how to get a 22-month old through washing his hair without shattering glass.  &nbsp;  I've wondered what Single-Dad support groups are like, what they talk about. I mean, I really can't find a reason for attending something like that but I would have some questions. For instance, how do you get the little stopper-thingies from sippy-cups good and clean? Yeah, yeah, I know the pat "Well, don't let it sit all day so the gunk doesn't build up," but really, kids are wonderful with "Hide the Sippy". If time really is money (and I've never figured out that equation) then spending 10 minutes sticking a toothpick into sippy-cup parts is just about equal with tossing it and buying a new one.  &nbsp;  For whatever reason, the little sippy-cup brushes are as elusive as the sippy-cups themselves. No matter where I keep them, they seem to escape, almost immediately. Or maybe the kids are hiding them. That would make sense because for each minute I spend toothpicking a sippy-cup, there's another minute for taking fish out of the fish tank and taking them for a swim in the puddle in the sandbox.  &nbsp;  I’m pretty sure the other dads are with me on just tossing the sippy-cup, so maybe I’d ask them how to get mashed-up Pop Tart out of anything, short of scoring it with a razor blade.&nbsp; The rule has always been, “No food leaves the table” but it seems Pop Tarts get pocketed; I find fruity-goo everywhere.&nbsp; And once it’s there, it’s part of the furniture. Maybe I need a jar of liquid nitrogen.  &nbsp;  Now that I think about it, I see no reason to go to a Single-Dad support group. I doubt metrosexuals need a support group, they seem like a pretty self-satisfied bunch (emphasis on “pretty”) and I doubt they have to deal with their hair-care products spilled all over a bed spread. Too bad for them; maybe their lives would be interesting.

      Marni is on the LEFT  urlLink

      Marni is my middle child, my 2nd born, my 3-year old, the little reiteration of my soul. I knew how bound we were almost from the time she was born. She had an affinity for daddy almost from the beginning as she looked to me, constantly, rose in her crib when I got ready for work, scuttled across the floor to greet me when I got home. In her infancy, she saw things I could not.  Asking me who my favorite kid is like asking me what my favorite song is - it's unanswerable because it is such an absurd question. Zeke was good as gold all day while the girls were fighting, fighting, fighting and then Zeke takes a favorite houseplant and turns it into a mound of mud on the carpet... there is no playing "favorites" on this journey. There is only a heart a-glow with three little burning fires, sometimes one outshines the others but only for a moment and then only because it is another's turn to shine. That's just how it works out, just like music.  Ten years ago I couldn't imagine that I could split this kind of total, unconditional love three ways but now I can't comprehend how I could have been so miserly with my love. Before I became a father, friends of mine talked about how parenthood "transforms" a person. I thought, yeah, you have tons more to do and zilch for social life. There was no possible way I could have known what they really meant, just how profound that change would be. Learning to love without limits is just one of the many gifts brought to me by my kids.  Although Marni resembles me in temperament, personality, love of music, so many things, she is not my "favorite", she is just the most like me. She is also very willful and brave (two qualities I do NOT possess) and that can be frightening. Today she ran out into the street and I flipped out, running out to grab her (and proving a poor example for the other two by not looking both ways) and then scolding her with no undue frustration. She cried, not because she had been yelled at, but because she was not getting to do what she wanted to do.  I fear she's going to be the kid who runs into traffic, blindly. Just like I was. I hope she also has my blind luck.   She has my creativity, for certain. She has a talent for making something from nothing and letting that entertain her for hours. In The Dulcimer Shop, she is immediately drawn to the strings, plucking, strumming, making music - she has a natural rhythm. I've wanted to get her into Dance Camp. She is tiny, nimble, a sprite. But Lilly's not getting Acting Camp and Zeke's not getting... well, Zeke's too young for camp and prefers sticking close to daddy... no Dance Camp for Marni but swimming for everybody in the fall. The creativity of compromise.    Interestingly enough, Marni was born on the day I was due to turn 40 (I was a preemie by almost a month). I'm an Aquarian, she's a Pisces. I don't know what that means but plenty of other people say they do and I'll leave those people their assessments. There's coincidence and there's spooky coincidence but I'm a skeptic and call it all Just Coincidence. Spooky thing on the genes, though.  Anyway, since she was about to turn three she's said, "I'm Blue." "Blue" the cartoon dog, she loves that show. Has a "Blue" stuffed animal, "Blue" pajamas. "Blue" is a girl puppy and she sets up puzzles for her friends to solve, so I don't mind that she's "Blue". She can have her Blue Period, like Picasso or Miles Davis, I don't object.  I took the kids for a short stroll through downtown tonight, all 700 Yards of it. A hot summer night, tourists looking for a way to stay cool, bikers filling the frosted mug of The Royal. A friend of mine, Joe, about to be a dad himself, saw me on the street, came over to shake my hand, meet the kids.  "I'm Marni," Marni said.   A small part of my heart broke at that moment. A precipitant sigh of loss, her Blue Period over. As I am cursed and blessed with an almost photographic memory, I can recall all of these moments, in all of my kids, the snaps of development where I see their lives pass before my eyes, arriving back in that point of their becoming, emerging, Marni, not "Blue".   If she's anything like Lilly, she'll be "Blue" for a couple more months and then the fascination will fade. Only to be replaced by another obsession and more of it, but a fascination of more complexity, more depth, more things in it. Marni already tells stories, plots, themes, intents; listening to her integrate more of her world into those stories is astounding to hear. I know she's already gotten a lot of mileage from being Blue and she figures out Blue's puzzles pretty easily.  Then again, Marni is a fighter, persistent, maybe she'll be Blue into Middle School. It wouldn't surprise me; like me, she's also eccentric. However, I'm betting she'll soon find something else to become, more Marni, less whatever it is she fancies herself to be.  Tonight just saw her blaze a little brighter on the street, her flame high in my heart.   OK, your first clue is, she was a baby. Got your handy-dandy notebooks? Your second clue is, she was "Blue". Now, we just need one more clue and we'll have figured out "Blue's Clues".  So, here's the third clue: Daddy is elated.  Answer: Bittersweet.

      Getting along with your X is helpful; I wouldn't have the energy to deal with the manipulation, greed, the petty games played out in court and out of school, everywhere unwinnable games matter. Too much work for me, my friend. Agreeing to not be disagreeable while trying not to disagree, accepting compromise at times... it keeps things serene.  "I'm compassionate if nothing else," I told a friend at TAM (The Ancient Mariner) last night, explaining why I let X (The X) have the kids a night.   "Yes you are," my friend replied, giving me a hug. I'd played barroom therapist for her one night, helped her resolve an issue with her father, she's always been gracious. But yes, I'd been compassionate with X.  X knows she has problems and needs to work those issues out. She also knows that the kids can't be around while she's getting it together. When she called the other day, I could hear the heartbreak. She missed her kids. She said she'd been staying sober, felt OK, she wasn't feeling manic. Her voice said it was all true.   Her last episode she'd been doing scrips, Xanax, Vicodin, the former she got from a doctor, the latter on trade for a few of the former. Third mental health/substance abuse hospitalization in a year. It was too much; hell, the first time was too much. I had to take the kids on by myself, indefinitely.   Fortunately, among all the things X and I agree on, that the kids come first is foremost. So when I said I would keep the kids indefinitely, she didn't fight me.   When I dropped the kids off, her place was pretty clean; when I picked them up, it was trashed, stuff everywhere. My kids have a gift for wrecking a place in a few short hours, if left unchecked. Not entirely compassionate, she gets no sympathy from me.  It's 3 A.M. and my youngest will be up in 4 hours - if I'm lucky. A diaper to change, a bowl of cereal to pour, an intermitent cup of Orange Juice to be monitored. More Apple Jacks on the floor, stickiness on the kitchen floor to be cleaned. The girls will be up soon after and although no diapers, plenty to clean. Their ceaseless chatter at the table will tell me that my day has irreversibly started.  I wouldn't have it any other way. At least for today.  X will start her own day in her own way, I suppose, but there's no way for me to know what she does. That's fine, too. I just hope it's another day of her getting her life together, I want what's best for her. However, what's best for the kids takes precedent over X's welfare, in my eyes. When she's ready to be a mom again... there's no telling. Until then, here I am.

      Bottle of beetles beside me, twenty or so bugs in a jar, an instant zoo, captured examples of a species thick at the front of my house and wild on my lampshades. My neighbor claims they feed off the Honey Locust that grows near the garbage cans but I’ve seen no evidence of that. I didn’t see a single bug in the tree and I didn’t find anything like these beetles when I went to look up Honey Locust-feeders on Google. They just seem to be around here. Indeed, I’ve caught one or two almost weekly since I moved in back in January but it’s turned into an infestation. One is crawling up the hair on my legs like a monkey treading atop a jungle canopy.  The bodies of these bugs are like exclamation points without the period, dark gray wings rimmed with lines of orange that form a chevron on the bug’s stern, separating a shiny black dome at the tip where the wings terminate. Although deft climbers on the south-facing windows of my house, their long, spindly legs appear almost useless for ascending the concavity of a marshmallow jar’s interior – they make it about half way up and then tumble to the bottom. There, on their backs, their patterns of orange and black bellies belies a variegated individuality, genetic diversity not otherwise evident.  I’ve been thinking of buying Lilly a hamster but these beetles have become instant pets on the fly. There’s no chance for emotional attachment to a beetle that, given its demise (my preferred method being the clockwise exit down the drain), can be replaced by any one of hundreds of candidates crawling on my lampshades. For now, Lilly thinks they’re cute, Marni snatches at them like a kitten, and Zeke, when he can catch one, summarily executes them with his overly enthusiastic scrutiny.   Nominally Buddhist, I try to teach my children respect for all life. However, I must admit some admiration at how adept Zeke is at expediting a beetle’s brief spin on its mortal coil. It beats Raid for God’s sake and at least Zeke is fascinated with our local fauna. His hasty dispatch of the little bastards is efficient and immediate; his sisters know that once between Mister’s fingers, the beetle is toast. He’s all, “Uh OH!” and onto the next beetle.  This zoological exhibit at my elbow is likewise ephemeral; tomorrow, the beetles go free, to the Colorado State University Extension Office where I’ll find out what these damn things are. The kids will love the trip and I’ll get to find out how to deal with these visitors. We’ll march right in there and demand to know what these are and what I need to do about them while the kids are doted on. That’s the American Way.   My way is to look at this jar while listening to Enrico Morricone, eyeing the insects like I’m the Man With No Name, a squint of cold disregard and contempt. A twist of my hand on the lid and these little buggers would be surfing the toilet to the sewer. But that’s not my way. I figure they have a reason for being and until I know they’re the reason for trees falling down or my foundation crumbling, they’ll get a fair chance to thrive. If the CSU Extension Office deems them benign, they’ll be free to fly and find themselves another lampshade.  I suppose the point of all of this is that I try to maintain a certain amount of consistency with my children, consistency of thought, purpose, conducting myself with other beings in the universe. If I don’t know, I look it up, ask the experts, find out if our little menagerie is not part of some malignant scourge. If I intend to teach respect, I’d better practice it in my own affairs. If I say that everything deserves its chance – as long as it’s not impinging on my chance – then it deserves its shot (Yellowjackets, bill collectors, and nazis need not apply). “Do as I say, not as I do” gets nothing done.  The kids can have their little zoo for now; maybe a hamster or a kitty or a puppy later on but for now, beetles will do. I’m not concerned with Zeke squeezing the brains out of beagle, more me dealing with three small children  and  a baby animal. I only have so much patience. As long as my brood is content with bugs in a jar and aren’t tossing the creatures into the microwave, I’ll continue to count my blessings.

      For those of you who've just joined me, so to speak, you may be under the impression that I'm some old skool Democrat of the Proud Donkey tradition. If that's the impression you've gotten, pack it in, it doesn't fit. Long-time readers know I don't have any affiliation and have said some rather unkind things about the Democrats in past posts; I really take them to task. Necessity has made me an  urlLink ABB voter  and anti-Nader, something I wouldn't have said a year or so ago. The preznit has driven this far-left crackpot to the center.  With that said, one of the things that is infuriating me is the Dem's/Kerry's inability to deal with issues head on. The same damn thing that's been happening for over 20 years, since Jimmy Carter got shellacked by Zombie Ronnie. With few exceptions, Democrats have been hiding from the "lib-ruhl" label and playing conciliatory games with the Right at the expense of working people and the progressive agenda. The latest hide-the-sausage slight of hand they've been shucking is addressing the economic growth of the last 10 months.   It's a ball that Bu$hCo believes is in it's court, Kerry won't bother to steal it, they got the ball, Democrats have no balls... huh? Well why not steal the goddamn ball?   First of all, the Cabal of Thugs report some pretty hinkey numbers in order to justify the tax cuts - new jobs, blah blah blah. Yeah, but this is an administration that will still have an aggragate loss of almost 2 million jobs (after adding in the jobs created) and  urlLink almost 10% unemployed  (in  urlLink REAL numbers , not phoney-baloney DoL numbers). 1 in 10 is out of a job, you'd think that might hurt Bush. And it's not like Kerry is running away from those numbers.  Still, there is a "recovery" going on, a scintilla of economic growth that the Kerry camp kind of coughs and rubs their hands at before they change the subject.  urlLink Pipsqueak growth, in fact,    The Commerce Department surprised economists with a downward revision to first-quarter gross domestic product, cutting economic growth to a 3.9 percent annual rate from the 4.4 percent reported a month ago. Wall Street analysts had not expected the Commerce Department to change the GDP estimate.   but enough for the Thug Cabal to point to and yammer, "See? SEE?!? We told you tax cuts for the rich would boost the economy!" What they aren't telling us is how much of that growth is attributed to a  Wartime Economy .  Remember that? Remember how, before the war started, a few protesters insisted that this administration was going to war just to jump-start the economy? And how a lot of pro-Bush/War pinheads pulled the argument of Wartime Economy out as their last refuge, scoundrel-wise? Thing is... it's TRUE.   Hell, anybody with access to The History Channel knows that when this country goes to war (Civil War included), people get  rich  - with or without the benefit of being vice-preznit. After people  right and left  bitched about our  urlLink troops not having sufficient body armor  and that  urlLink humvees were vulnerable to roadside bombs , our patriotic corporate executives got to work on those problems... see?   Never mind that a sizable chunk of the money is being sheltered off-shore... hell, mer-kins are at work again, got it? Haliburton is  urlLink hiring like crazy ... sorry if you just got  urlLink pink-slipped from MCI  but you may want to think about a  urlLink "short-term commitment" with the National Guard .  Now it seems like EVERYONE, Right and Left, mull this economic upswing, either overstating it or looking at it like it was some bastard child come to grub, mumbling about it being 'cyclic' or praising it as a "miracle of free-market economics" (cuz, you know, no one has yet to provide me proof that tax cuts for the rich have led to long-term economic growth). Lip-service all around and no one wants the reals when the answer is  right there in their fucking face .   The problem I have is that the Right isn't honest enough to admit that this small blip is due to deficit spending allocated towards war material while the Left (and the Democrats who once held a place on the Left) isn't honest enough to acknowledge that, yes, there's economic growth but it's only because we're killing a couple dozen or so American women and men every week, if it wasn't for wartime development we'd be happy to be shining the hubcaps of some asshole's Rolls Royce.   WHY ISN'T ANYBODY SAYING THIS?    If Bush stands a chance in November, it's because he's diverted attention from the failure of the war to the "success" of the economy. Therefore, all Democrats need do is point out that the economy is  urlLink  PROBABLY  due to the war  (I'll explain in a minute), thus... POINTING BACK TO THE FAILURE OF THE WAR. It didn't take me five beers to figure that out, believe me. It's obvious that the Administration has no say on national security, comparing war records is absurd, during the debates Bush is going to look like the stoner kid in geometry class... all they have left is the economy and... well, I just told you how this all comes full circle.  "PROBABLY due to the war" - make it a soft sell. Let people decide for themselves if the lives of their sons and daughters are worth the creation of jobs... "Yeah, well EVERYONE knows  urlLink war drives an economy  but look at the war  you  took us into...", an apparently ( urlLink by today's polls ) increasingly unpopular war. Mer-kins can see that this economic recovery is half-assed (1 in 10 chance they're unemployed, hell) and that the numbers they hear on the nooze are baked, abstractions, utter shit.   All the Kerry ads in Colorado have been positive, "I'm John Kerry, this is my plan, yadda..." but all the Bush ads are negative: "John Kerry wants to use your paycheck to finance a peccadillo between your wife and Bill Clinton." Something like that... anyone anywhere else see it differently (is Kerry only going ALL POSITIVE in Colorado?). So the Kerry campaign is already into the soft sell stuff, as I see it, there's no need to hammer this issue; people can see it for themselves.  On the topic of seeing it for themselves, I didn't get to go see  FAHRENHEIT 9/11  (got the kids, too young to take) but friends have and  all of them  say it was excellent, better than  BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE , take someone who's sitting on the fence for this election, they'll be PISSED.  urlLink Get your tickets  and go to the show...  Show? In Denver at Eck's Saloon....

      I give you a glimpse of my new hottie wife, Janeane Garofolo - kneel down and adore her, all of you. And kneel down to thank me.   Janeane says it... well, WELL.  urlLink This interview  (on  urlLink The Advocate  via  urlLink Buzzflash ) explains why she is having my children. Sort of. Well, not at all, in fact, but read it, she's too cool, my kids or not.  So, if you read her, you'll see what a dumbell I really am. Really. I'm not that smart of a guy.   This isn't fake humility (although I fake it well) because it's true. There's a bunchabetter web sites dealing with politics (and I link em' over on the right... well, they're LEFT but they're linked on the right, I kinda' doesn't matter where I linked em') and I hope my readers are reading those links. They're all excellent sites, some well-written, all informative, every single one funded by the vast left-wing conspiracy to further flouridate water and make Hillary Clinton Queen of Queer As Folk.   Well, maybe my readers don't ALWAYS click links, I think, and maybe my site educates those who don't - well, don't look at those links. They want the perspective of some half-pint pundit punkrockerwannabe. Pathetic, I know, but you have to look at all sides of the argument.   I know I don't know.   I don't know but I think, think this is going to be a suprising summer,  not dead newswise. In fact, I think there's going to be some unreal shit going on: a middle-east more de-stabilized by our arrogance and aggression, a veritable field day for terrorists in Athens and Boston (site of the Democratic National Convention), wildfires in the west (of course) but BAD fucking wildfires, Michael Moore's movie, playing "Don't Plame Me" in the whitehouse... if there isn't a meltdown in this country this summer, particularly, a meltdown in this administration, and I don't see a bunch of tightasses holding there rectums as they run for the head - well, fuck it, I'm heading to France. Read me in October and tell if I'm I'm wrong but I'm NEVER wrong about this kind of stuff.  My question is, do you need to hear it from me? I say no but I don't want to do a disservice to Boondoggle by taking up their space with my political rants. My argument is, you can get all this political stuff elsewhere. So maybe I should just use this space to "muse" (like a cyber Peggy Hill) and leave the politics to the pros.  What do you say?  If you're reading me on  urlLink  Everything You Know Is Wrong  , you can just comment at the bottom, click on the 'comment' link, it's not rocket science. If you're reading me on  urlLink  the Boondoggle web site  , you'll have to  urlLink email me  as usual... if you can't figure any of that out, the email address is  urlLink chaosofmind@msn.com  (for Boondoggle readers, I know it's the same addy for blogger readers). I guess I'll take votes and input until, well, July 4th - what a day for free speech, while we have it, at least some semblance of it, eh, Herr Ashcroft? Heil, Bush.  If you're reading me... and I feel like I'm on a Ham-fucking-Radio in the thirties, "IF YOU'RE READING ME, this is dangerous and our country is in some serious shit!"... if you're reading me, you  KNOW  I'm not going to sit still when Junior insists on fucking up. Just can't do it, wouldn't be prudent. If you have a barrel full of fish, I have a thirty-eight. Just naw naw naw on political stuff ALL THE TIME, that's what I'm Sayin...  BTW, I've got a date to be in Denver at Eck's Saloon on the 29th, this Tuesday. If you see me there, you can weigh into me with your vote. In fact, just see me there, the girl and the boys will be happy you did.

      Wish in one hand, shit in the other, yeah, yeah, yeah...  I guess  urlLink Cheney thinks we're all children  in this country, that if he insists Santa Claus exists, we're all going to nod and say, "Yeah, Uncle Dick, there is a Santa Claus." Cheney should have bailed when the going was good and  urlLink dumped the Preznit  before he ended up looking like a short-changed chump.  So the 9/11 Commission reports there's  urlLink no link between bin Laden and Saddam  but Cheney and Bush hold tight to the lie and say, "Is!" Hmmmmm... now, if I can recall this playground game, either you answer "Isn't" and continue on this infinite regress or you demand, "Prove it!"  A gambit I don't think Bu$hCo is prepared to confront. Bush, Cheney, and Rice insist that there's "ample evidence" that significant connections can be made between Iraq and Al Qaeda... uh, so where are they? Is this some kind of magic trick? Pull a rabbit out of a hat or pull your head out of your ass?   urlLink Andrew C. McCarthy at the NRO  seems to think he's got all the evidence Bu$hCo needs and... well, golly, am I the only one who thinks this palaver is  WEAK ? If this is the extent of the evidence (and it's hardly evidence, it's more like "he said, she said"), then the administration needs to just rat itself out and admit, "Yeah, we were just making shit up, we bought Chalbi's crap and realized we were fucked. We got screwed, folks.... sorry about your kids  DYING ..."  Look, just because Bush/Cheney says it's so, don't make it so... alas, the same is to be said of myself and Brody Dalle. However, me not actually getting laid by Ms. Dalle doesn't  urlLink play into Al Qaeda's hands  as Bu$hCo's shit is about to do:   A senior US intelligence official is about to publish a bitter condemnation of America's counter-terrorism policy, arguing that the west is losing the war against al-Qaida and that an "avaricious, premeditated, unprovoked" war in Iraq has played into Osama bin Laden's hands.    Wonderful. Get ready for the next big thing from angry arabs. At least with Brody and me, we make love, not war.

      You can get the transcript from  urlLink Tonight's Dateline here  or you can get a  urlLink partial transcript from Drudge  and see what that dumbfuck  wants  you to read. It pretty much doesn't matter; what you get at NBC is what those whores want you to see and no more (excuse the pun). You know they edited the shit out of this thing.  Matt Lauer was a pip, though; I thought he was going to bust a vein in his head, blast off the ugly chair and start wailing on fat ol' Mike. Christ, with that pseudo-skinhead faux wannabe soldier boy haircut, he was the poster boy of the Right Wing thugs I wrote about in the last post.   Lauer was visibly PISSED; so much for "objective" journalism. If there were any doubts about how far NBC was up Bu$hCo's ass, all you had to see was how frothing-at-the-mouth-shut-yer-goddamn-pie-hole-ya-commie-faggot Mr. Matt was in this interview. I bet he was double-timing it at the gym to get his piddling reserves of testosterone pumped for THIS interview.  For his part, Fat Mike took Lauer to the mat (again, sorry for the pun) and pinned his puny ass:   Moore: "You know I've been sitting here for like the last 20 minutes thinking, man, if he would have only asked Bush administration officials these kind of hard questions in the weeks leading up to the war, and then when the war started, maybe there wouldn't be a war. Because the American people, once given the truth, you know the old saying from Abraham Lincoln, give the people the facts and the Republic will be safe."   Obviously, this got by the NBC editors after they'd squandered their meager intellects slicing and dicing the previous 19 minutes (which amounted to about 12 minutes of video on the floor). The seven minutes we got amounted to Michael Moore saying, "Yeah, I just don't like Bush," and Matt Lauer growling like he thought he was a real man or something.  It was unfuckingbelievable. What was more unfuckingbelievable is that I held out to watch  urlLink Tweety interview Ron Reagan  and ask the hard questions, like:  Tweety: Have you noticed that the sun doesn't shine nearly as bright since your dad's ass is underground?  and  Tweety: Don't you think, in this light, with my head turned this way, that I look a little like Jane Wyman?  Ron said he'd like history to remember that his dad was a "good man" which I think translates into "a simple man" and yes, we can all agree on that (post translation). Likewise, NBC obviously wants us to remember that it has left its mouth open for any Right Wing cock to insert itself at its pleasure.

      Maybe it's summer time and there's not much to report. Maybe the incompetence of Bu$hCo thugs has become so banal it almost seems redundant to comment on their latest fuck up. I can't figure what's up in my kitchen much less within the blogosphere but it seems that recently I've seen some whining here and there about the sorry state of discourse in this country.  Clinton  urlLink brought it up , a bit, when he spoke at the White House for the unveiling of his portrait, that we need to "return to vigorous debate about who's right and wrong, not who's good and bad". David Brooks at the NY Times has threatened  urlLink he'll weigh in  with his insight on this matter. The Daily Howler  urlLink takes Brooksie to task  most of this week and points out the fairly obvious...  Are you getting the sense that I'm going to piss in this campfire? Yeah, well, if you've read me for the past three years in  urlLink my other blog , you know that I'm not convinced there's a lot you can say to someone on the right unless you first hit em' up with a load from a tranqulizer gun. As I've maintained these past few years, Progressives tend to base their arguments on  reason  while the Right is informed almost entirely by belief and emotion (and indulge in numerous  urlLink logical fallacies  in order to endow their arguments with characteristic stupidity). Ergo, discourse is impossible because  "discourse"  is based on - REASON.   After I started writing this last night, I began to realize it was looking like a thesis and not a blog. Screw that, I don't need a grade. But if I was going to grade Conservatives, whiny bitches they are, on the sorry state of discourse they moan and gnash teeth over, I'd give them an  'F' . Because all you have to do is look around and see that they're behaving like Nazi SS thugs.   Remember the "spontaneous protest" in Miami after the 2000 Presidential election that helped  urlLink stop the announced manual recount  of the 10,750 undervote in Miami-Dade County? I remember  urlLink the images  so well, Oxford-shirted Power-tied no-necked dittoheads frothing at the mouth and acting like drunken frat boys on a rampage. And we were supposed to believe these were outraged citizens who had spontaneously come together to riot  AGAINST  the democratic process... remember?   Instigated by an order from New York congressman John Sweeney to "shut it down," dozens of screaming GOP demonstrators pounded on doors and a picture window at elections headquarters.  The mob gang-rushed a local Democrat carrying a blank sample ballot. They threatened that a thousand Cubans were on their way to the headquarters to stop the count. Several people were "trampled, punched or kicked," according to The New York Times. The canvassing board chair at first conceded that mob pressures played a role in the shutdown—which cost Gore the 168 votes as well—but later reversed his position.    Yeah, it was such a "spontaneous" show of support for Bu$hCo stealing an election except that the  urlLink Bush organization spent about $1.2 million  to fly operatives to Florida to riot.   For me, that was a hint at how civilized these apes would behave, in the interest of "discourse".  Now fast forward to the past few weeks. The picture at the beginning of this entry should be enough to make your stomach churn, it's the image of Lori Haigh, owner of Capobianco Gallery in North Beach, San Francisco, was  urlLink spat on and knocked unconscious  for exhibiting artwork highlighting the torture of Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib prison. The assault came after two weeks of escalating threats by extreme right-wing elements.   Or just this past week when  urlLink Bon Jovi raised $1 Million for Kerry  and got death threats for his trouble:   Musician Jon Bon Jovi says criticism and intimidation won't stop him from speaking out in support of Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry, who raised $1 million at the singer's home Monday night. ``I've received hate mail at my house. I've had people drive by my home and shout things out,'' Bon Jovi told guests gathered outside his home along the Navesink River. ``And I think that they question my patriotism because I decided to stand up and have a voice. And I stood up to have a voice because I think that's the most American thing that you can do.''   Oh, those brave, noble conservatives, calling up rock singers and making anonymous death threats, while still making time to whimper about the polarization of discourse in this country...   Discourse? You mean there's discourse?  Who's defining "discourse"? When we get the next Nobel Laureate (NOT)  urlLink Bill O'Reilly comparing Michael Moore and Al Franken to Goebbels  while comparing Hollywood celebs to the Nazi faithful, as his listeners drive around New Jersey making threats or punching women out in San Francisco. It seems pretty goddamned stupid to ask, "What happened to civil discourse in this country?" Drudge asks  urlLink ESPN to censor Hunter S. Thompson , followed by the fuckwits in Freeperville taking HST to task with what amounts to name-calling without providing a single, cogent counter-argument... I mean really, REALLY, do I need some shit-for-brains wingnut to give me a black eye to get the sense of what's happened to discourse in this country?   YOU  tell me....

      There's nothing like the feeling that I have my finger on the pulse of SOMETHING... I don't care what it is, organic or abstract, it at least gives me the sense that sometimes I know something.   If you got a look at the last post on my   urlLink other blog   (06/10/2004 7:59 PM -- Lies), you saw the text of a letter that I sent to the  urlLink CSIndy  and the  urlLink News Director at KKTV  pretty much saying:   The noble thing, the truly journalistic thing would be for KKTV to report what it honestly knows: "Look folks, we're aware that most of you believe Iraq had something to do with terrorism but it just ain't so - we were ALL lied to. We're not the smartest news station but we have some integrity and we're here to tell you that Iraq had nothing to do with terrorism, well, that is, at least not until we "liberated" that country. So we're sorry for repeating the lie and we hope you'll quit believing it."    So today we get a report from the 9/11 Commission that there was   urlLink no credible link between Iraq and Al Qaeda  . Well, surprise, surprise, the major news outlets are all over the story looking like they're reporting, with awe and enthusiasm, that "Scientists affirm that Oxygen is a colorless, odorless gas!".   OK, so I was right, yeah, so what. Nobody likes Mr. Smarty-pants when he's playing "I told you so". No, I'm not here to show off my woodie on being right, only because this is not the end of the story. Because, according to a recent  urlLink PIPA/Knowledge Networks poll , 57 percent of Americans believe Iraq was substantially supporting al Qaeda or was directly involved in the 9/11 attacks and that   (t)hese beliefs are highly related to support for the war. Among those who believed that Iraq was providing support to al Qaeda, 70 percent said that going to war with Iraq was the right decision and 54 percent said it was the best thing to do. Among those who did not have such a belief, only 35 percent said it was the right thing and 22 percent said it was the best thing to do.   This has to relate to our prestige in the world, as if the rest of the world could point to us and say, "Most Americans believe in Santa Claus." That's embarassing - or should be. Honestly, I get the sense that a lot of Americans just don't care, that Preznit Chimp caught a sense of some very scary zeitgeist by pissing all over our alliances and going about this alone.   What's scariest about Bu$hCo is the determination to follow through on what he thinks is right, fuck what anybody else thinks. He believes Jesus is his guide and he really doesn't give two shits about Democracy or the Constitution. What we need is for most Americans to believe THAT, that Bush is bad for this country and more dangerous to the US than Saddam Hussein or Al Qaeda could ever be.

      See... stick to your goddamn guns and the Universe turns and nods, "Yes, you're doing just fine, son (daughter), this thing  EVOLVES  despite the machinations of the ludites and philistines."  As  urlLink Bartcop  calls it, "The Invisible Cloud Being" answers our prayers in many ways - for instance, I just won the fucking powerball and now I'm a mega-fucking-millionaire. No shit. I can buy Halliburton and still have change to pay  urlLink Rush Limbaugh's alimony  AND a sack of Herr O'Winn to tide Vulgar Pigboy over until his next jones.  What I'm talkin' about is the endevour proscribed in the last post: writing to theatres to not let them think that wingnuts aren't the only webmaniacs who give two shits.     This is FUCKING IMPORTANT   because Skip Huston writes back to me in response to my email (hey, fuck you all, I walk my talk) with   Thanks for your support! We need to hear from more of the good guys!   Which says to me that  ONLY THE BAD GUYS HAVE BEEN WRITING , y'know what I mean? So get off yer' apathetic asses, read my last post, and  EMAIL  fer chrissake... don'tcha bitch if Dubya steals another election through Brother Jeb when  ya' didn't WRITE!

      Let me get this out of the way  quickly  before I get back to biz-ness, K?   Welcome to all my readers from  urlLink the boonie blog  and I hope you'll keep coming here. The boonie blog had some technical issues that 'webmaker' didn't have time to address - and I wasn't inclined to hold back and wait for those issues to get fixed. I hope they  will  get fixed, it would be nice to be able to post in both places.   There. All the niceties are out of the way and I can return to being the asshole you all know and can barely tolerate.  After grabbing my morning Barrel-o'-kawfee and stuffing the kids with Pop Tarts and stale burritos (steeped in milk - I am a good dad, afterall), I went surfing to my standard stops on the web. One of the first things I saw on  urlLink Blah3  was this tidbit about how the  urlLink wingnuts are trying to shut down Michael Moore's new film  through their  urlLink crappy little website . As Blah3 recommends (and I concur):    On that site, there is  urlLink a list of email addresses  for theater chains which have committed to showing the film, as well as chains that are still undecided.   Use the list. Send thanks to those who support freedom of speech in this country, and encouragement to those who have not yet made the decision to do so. Thank you.   Ever notice how a pathetic number of Conservatives are all too willing to call an anti-war American "un-patriotic" and "coward" without a second thought? Folks,  urlLink in Psychology this is known as "Projection":    Projection is one of the defense mechanisms identified by Freud and still acknowledged today. According to Freud, projection is when someone is threatened by or afraid of their own impulses so they attribute these impulses to someone else. For example, a person in psychoanalysis may insist to the therapist that he knows the therapist wants to rape some women, when in fact the client has these awful feelings to rape the woman.    Honest, open discourse  frightens  these conservatives, so they seek to shut it down. Cowardice? That's what I call it; "Intellectual Cowardice", to be specific. Anything outside their narrow, black & white view of the Universe disgusts them, scares them, sends them running into a pack to organize a boycott or babble mindlessly on their freeper discussion board.   If you wish to see the precedent for this, you need not look any further than the Preznit and his administration.  urlLink Atrios  trenchantly points this out in  urlLink today's post looking back at AssCrack's testimony  regarding ThugCo's policy for "information extraction" of Iraqi prisoners. Essentially, AssCrack indulges in a bit of Inter-rectal Cranail Insertion while one could cook crepes on the White House document shredders.  The country I grew up in was touted as a place where my  Freedom of Speech  was not only potected, it was sacrosanct. The Founding Fathers knew that free speech would not only make our country  strong  (through the infusion of new ideas, a 'new idea' being the philosphical underpinning of our country) but would keep the country  honest  - honesty is not the hallmark of any dictatorship. The anti-free speech Conservatives have either forgotten this or prefer a dictatorship (there is a compelling reason to believe that many Conservatives would like nothing more than to institute a Theocratic Christian Dictatorship). As such, eschewing free speech (and attempting to stifle free speech when it contradicts their own ideas) makes these Conservatives  un-patriotic .  I'm calling myself Mr. Master-of-the-Obvious today because all of this seems awfully fucking self-evident; it's not a stretch. Likewise, it should be painfully obvious that it's high time to take our country back, the anti-free speech Conservatives have dominated our national dialogue for too long while their boy in the White House wipes his ass with our Constitution on a daily basis. All we have to do is take a little action...   Things to do TODAY:  Take  urlLink Blah3 's suggestion and email a note of support to the  urlLink theatres listed by the Fuckwits  and show them they have much more support than the unpatriotic cowards would lead them to believe. I wrote:   Subject: I support - and want to see - “Fahrenheit 9/11”!!! I was appalled to learn that the tiny minds at http://www.moveamericaforward.org/ were attempting to pressure your theatres from showing “Fahrenheit 9/11”; I was DISGUSTED to learn that some theatres and their employees had received threats from idiots who had less interest in the forces of the free market and our Constitutional right to free speech than in wrapping themselves in a flag of fear.  For myself, I applaud any theatre that decides to show “Fahrenheit 9/11” and I can assure you that theatres that DO show “Fahrenheit 9/11” will appreciate the ticket sales this movie will certainly generate. I have faith in the American people and their commitment to the truth. Unlike the unpatriotic cowards at http://www.moveamericaforward.org/, I believe most Americans aren't afraid of knowing what their government is up to and resent it when the truth is withheld from them. As such, “Fahrenheit 9/11”, although a documentary, will probably set records.  Please don't allow the forces of these closed-minded and un-American thugs influence your decision to show this important and award-winning film.   Don't copy my text (I don't want them to think they're being spammed), I have faith that my readers, if nothing else,  think for themselves.  If you want a quick-and-easy 'BCC:' list,  urlLink email me  and I'll send you back a Notepad file that you can copy and paste into your 'BCC:' fields.  While you're at it, and emailing folks,  urlLink Email the fuckwits , as I did:   "Un-American" is, shit-for-brains, stifling free-expression; remember that little American document called "The Constitution"?   If Conservatives had the mental wherewithal to produce their own movie, say, "Bush in NOT a Liar", I wouldn't call for a boycott.  See, Progressives thrive on the free exchange of ideas. Conservatives fear it.   You intellectual cowards...   You can copy that if you want, I could care less what those Fucktards think (hell, I'm not convinced they CAN think!).   2 things to do today - I think you can handle it. Get emailing...

      I happened to catch Rep. John Culbertson, (R) Texas, on  urlLink Lou Dobbs Tonight  saying that Arabs are coming over the border, changing their Arab surnames to Hispanic surnames and then “blending in with the illegal alien population”, specifically:    &nbsp;The issue today is, we are at war with individuals trying to sneak into the country under false identities. And I have new information from federal law enforcement officials in Texas who are very alarmed by a growing trend of Islamic individuals coming into the country, changing their Islamic surnames to Hispanic surnames, blending into the thousands of illegal aliens coming into the country. &nbsp;  What a trick. I suppose that, to Culbertson, those monkeys not only all look alike, they all SOUND ALIKE. Granted, there’s probably some Arabs who also speak Spanish, probably more than a few. Maybe even a few who speak it flawlessly, without an accent. But, um… well, what are the chances that an Arab speaks fluent, accent-less Spanish AND is a member of a terror cell. Oh yeah, plus we have all the cultural considerations.    To me, what the airhead is saying is, “These illegal spicks are too goddamn stupid to tell an Arab in their midst.” Really. Think about this. Culbertson&nbsp;honestly believes that illegal aliens would be oblivious to an Arab posing as a Latino.   Ask any Spanish-speaking Latino,&nbsp;Hispanics&nbsp;know accents. Furthermore, the illegals are a pretty tight community. I’d pretty much bet the kid’s change jar that Culbertson didn’t talk to anybody but other white boys about this whole “thing”.   It could work; they all look alike to me. Culbertson and the rest of those freepers, I mean.   All of em’ looking alike has to be the focus of the rationale because it would have to be  impossible  pull it off (realistically), at least on a large scale. Al Qaeda (or whomever) would have had to start schooling hundreds of operatives in the Spanish language and Latino culture – and start this evil plot almost two decades ago - with the intention that those operatives would eventually slip over the border to pose as an illegal Mexican laborer.   Wow. If you thought coordinating hijackers to fly airliners into buildings was tactical genius, the whole brown-skinned confusion-thing is a master-stroke.   A few years back, before the war, I can’t really remember thinking, “Are you so stupid that you think the rest of us are going to believe that HORSESHIT?” at least not as much since a little before the war. But now it hits me, well, like today, TWICE A DAY, maybe more on other days. Back in the day, Falwell or some other intellectually impoverished clown would mouth off and pretty much ninety-percent of the population kind of laughed the whole thing off. Tinky-Winky is gay, OK Jerry, thanks for the heads up, I’ll tell my 2-year old and she’ll be as concerned as me.   Reaching for a two-year old’s mentality, I guess. It has a sense of a two-year old’s sense of uninformed plausibility, “Did you do that?” “No, it fell.” “How did it fall?” “I dunno, Tinky-Winky pushed it!” “Where are the WMD’s?” “I dunno, somebody said they were there and maybe were thinking about WMD-like programs.”   Twice today, I said, and although Annie Jacobsen didn’t flip out over Arabs on an airplane today, it was today that I  urlLink heard about this :     The passenger, later identified as Annie Jacobsen, was in danger of panicking other passengers and creating a larger problem on the plane, according to a source close to the secretive federal protective service.   Jacobsen, a self-described freelance writer, has published two stories about her experience at womenswallstreet.com, a business advice web site designed for women.   “The lady was overreacting,” said the source. “A flight attendant was told to tell the passenger to calm down; that there were air marshals on the plane.”   The middle eastern men were identified by federal agents as a group of touring musicians travelling to a concert date at a casino, said Air Marshals spokesman Dave Adams.   &nbsp;  I read the article (heh) and you’ll notice I didn’t link the site. There’s the URL if you want to go there and read her harrowing account (brrrrrrrrr) but trust me – I’m positive you’re not as stupid as her – you’ll find several pages of hysterical uninformed plausibility. Oh yeah, Tinky-Winky was on the plane, too, off to Massachusetts to marry his long-time partner, Top Cat.   Overwhelmed by my own pre-adolescent mentality, I was moved to write the following email to the editors of womenswallsteet:     RE: Terror in the Skies, Again?   I'm amazed your site continues to run this bilge water (equally amazed that you'd consider Ann Coulter a legitimate citation). It's all over the web how this cunt over-reacted. I'd think you'd have a vested interest in creating an aura of credibility for yourselves but maybe readers gullible enough to buy Jacobsen's histrionics are exactly the kind of rubes you need to sign up for your half-assed service.   Congratulations on becoming this week's "Joke of the Web" site!   &nbsp;  So I throw a firecracker, they throw a turd; same behavior but I’m smarter. Obviously the Air Marshals were too smart to be anything but pissed at Insane Annie. Maybe I was too harsh on womenswallstreet, they’re acting out of enlightened altruism and running Annie’s crack-up only to prevent her from falling further over the edge. Yeah, and there are Arab implants “blending into the thousands of illegal aliens coming into the country,” and fooling&nbsp;all of em'. Nope, the only ones that are getting fooled are stupid white boys&nbsp;and crazy white women on airplanes...&nbsp;uh, yeah.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    OK, you gotta  urlLink check this  out:     During a prime time press conference on April 13, President Bush was asked to name a mistake that he has made since taking office and what he has learned from it. Bush, who was unable to answer the question, admitted "maybe I'm not as quick on my feet as I should be in coming up with [a mistake]." But weeks later, Bush still hasn't answered the question. In the interest of assisting the President with this surprisingly difficult task we've compiled this list of 100 mistakes he has made since taking office.   &nbsp;from  urlLink http://www.americanprogress.org/ . At least a two-year old can admit&nbsp;she's wrong.   &nbsp;Also, you can save youself $10 and get the&nbsp;9/11 report&nbsp;from  urlLink Patridiots &nbsp;(tell em' sorry for stealing bandwidth) but you'll spend more than that if you print it out.

Actually, it turns out that this guy raised funds for Kerry (among others) and then got popped on this totally unrelated charge. Let the witchhunt begin...

      I saw Rice saying, with all the conviction she's shown with talking about WMD's, that no, there's  urlLink no way the elections will be delayed  due to terrorists or Michael Moore or whatever, we've had elections during wartime.   Uh huh. So why say it?   Because Karl Rove is trying to insinuate to Democrats, "Remember what we did with the last election? Don't think we can't pull a bigger and BADDER stunt this time around. Hell, we might just cancel the whole goddamn thing and call this country OURS! If you thought State Troopers keeping a few Darkies in Florida from the polls was slick, just wait until you see us draggin' off folks to  urlLink one of Rumsfeld's secret prisons  just for TRYING to vote for Kerry!"  You might as well pay  urlLink See the Forest  right now if you took his bet:   I'm willing to bet $50 at 30-to-one that we'll see problems in the 2004 Presidential election as bad or worse than those in the 2000 election. Your $1500 says everything will be OK, my $50 says that there will be major problems -- as bad as or worse than 2000. (via  urlLink Atrios )   We're still two weeks away from the Democratic National Convention and the Ministry of Discombobulation is already working with the Ministry of Homeland Security to game the vote. Except they're more transparent this time - hell, they just don't give a shit, anymore, they'll do ANYTHING!   Like last week, when Kerry announced Edwards. Next day Ridge announced "new intelligence" that al Qaeda has "Big plans" (or something) for the election. And then says we won't elevate the terror level from Yellow (Vague and Persistent Feelings of Anxiety) to Orange (4,000 Air Traffic Security Workers Laid Off), just prances off like Aunt Jess, "Well, a little bird told me..."   And so I ask again... why say it?  This isn't sneaky, it's peurile, "Ha Ha, made ya' look!" kinda' crap. Don't wonder where your job went, wonder what you think about Gay Marriage and for God's sake don't worry about what we said regarding anthrax oatmeal Usama Scott Peterson smallpox dirty bombs and war good in Iraq or we wouldn't be telling you about warheads WMDs X-Files blackbox towel-heads out to gitcha' playground suicide bomber automatic rifle... it's like sneaking out of the NAACP gig in black face, just plain adolescent.  We've got changing the constitution to ban Gay marriages and then rescinding the assault weapons ban coming up in congress immediately, plenty enough distractions to make the "Made Ya' Look" game interesting. In the interim, I assume more "new intelligence" will come to light, another blackout in Athens, lights flashing... are you ready?

      Some new readers contacted me this week, a welcome is in order for them. Danielle, with the intoxicating smile, hellooooo. Tandy (of the extremely intriguing emails), I'm going to address one of the issues you raised in an early email, so just wait. Travis, the local anarchist agitator, we're going to hit on your stuff immediately. But first I want to deal with some feedback from an old acquaintance, Scott.  Scott tells me that he and his wife are planning to drive to New York City at the end of the summer to  urlLink protest the the Rethug convention  Aug. 30 to Sept. 2 and he invites all of us to make that road trip with him.   I think that would be cool (although I wouldn't be taking my kids for THAT). For THAT I'd put on my blackbloc uniform and take a shot of tear gas. Hmmmm, maybe it's better that I do stay close to home. At least for now. I predict that Kerry/Edwards are going to blow Bush/Cheney out of the water, anyway. No need for my head getting smashed into Big Apple concrete when my money's on the winning horse (that was not a slam at Kerry's looks, I assure you).  Anyway, Scott, thanks for the invitation and I call on everyone who can to go to NYC and show Bu$hCo that we mean to kick his sorry ass to the curb.   In return, Scott & family, I invite you to the  urlLink Anarchist Social Retreat 2004  August 19 - 22 in  urlLink Del Norte, Colorado  for what Travis describes as, "...a 3 day weekend of networking, relaxing and fun - all FREE!" It's also a kid-friendly event and I intend to take my brood. If you're interested in going, helping out, whatever, you can email Travis for more information  urlLink loveliberate@yahoo.com  or get involved on the discussion boards at  urlLink http://www.groups.yahoo.com/group/asr2004  or at  urlLink http://www.dbom.net/mhrbb  where folks are getting all the details together.   Hang out in the San Juans at the end of August with some anarchists... what else could you ask of summer?  Now to address something Tandy said about blogs being an exercise in self-revelation. I have to admit that I've been entertaining the idea of making this thing a bit more personal, a little less political. I asked you all for input in my entry   urlLink So This Is What You Get   but nobody weighed in with any advice; not a soul. Now I know a few people are reading this even if they're not commenting. So I think I'm going to get experimental on your ass, see where that goes. I haven't been blogging much of late mostly because I've been working on my writing. That's what I'd like to share here, keep my damned opinions to myself.   We'll give it a month, k?

      Gawd... I mean   God   but it rankles me when the Presidential campaign gets to be about this: "Family values". That Gawd-Thing that leads candidates to thump their chests self-righteously, jest like me de-voot Katlick mudda at Mass, and makes me wonder, as it did when I watched me mudda do it then... "Why?"   Kerry,  urlLink at some 4th picnic in Iowa , defending his stand and beliefs,   "I oppose abortion, personally," (Kerry) told the newspaper. "I don't like abortion. I believe life does begin at conception. But I can't take my Catholic belief, my article of faith, and legislate it on a Protestant or a Jew or an atheist ...who doesn't share it. We have separation of church and state in the United States of America."  made me pause (briefly) and remember  urlLink why I supported Dean  at first - I knew Dean wouldn't have been stupid enough to say "I believe life does begin at conception." I mean, Gore lost my vote to Nader in 2000 because (among many other things) I couldn't forgive Tipper and the whole PMRC fiasco, smacking as it did of walking into the Moral Majority's playpen. But I see what Kerry was trying to do and I am so ABB at this point, I put my dudgeon aside.  Exceptionally more vile was the Rethug response:  The Bush campaign reacted strongly to Mr. Kerry's statement of personal opposition to abortion. "John Kerry's efforts to mislead voters in the heartland are offensive," said Kevin Madden, a Bush campaign spokesman. "His rhetoric is at odds with a long record of opposing common-sense measures like the ban on partial-birth abortion."  probably effective for the few million or so shitwits who'll  urlLink shell out cuz' Falwell said so  but screw them - their minds are made up (and they're welcome to them hush puppies). Funny how Mr. Madden didn't finish up with just how far Whistle-Ass goes with his commitment to anti-choice and include stem-cell research but, uh, that's  urlLink a little contentious in the Senate right  now, so...  Put the Gawd thing aside for a moment and put your money on which candidate would outscore the other on a 10th-grade Science exam. Uh huh; see? Christ, conservatives claim to know the value of a Dollar... add in charisma (a quality Gore sorely lacked until he grew a sack this year) and you get an idea of how the debates are gonna' go. It's pretty clear where the smart money is.   Besides, the lugnuts are popping off of this administration like Limbaugh's shirt buttons, so George is gonna' be rattled. In fact,  I see a relapse coming, a huge sack of blow and lots of Jack Daniels.   Coked to the gills and drunker n' Aunt Ginny at Bingo, George'll appeal to gawdamighty several times in the debates (I'll take book on THAT FACT as well, the gawdamighty thing, at least), prattle a bit about economy and taxes; Prolly drag out Reagan's corpse and jangle it around like some fetish; and then he'll go to the last resort of any geekin', stinkin' scoundrel.   Well, I say bring on the war records and hours spent wrapped in the flag. Hell, bring out the skeletons, the spooks, and the cooked books. Bring em' on (yeah, people tend to get hurt REAL BAD whenever that's said, see?), Skippy, the only way Kerry can fuck this up is if he makes it look like he's bullying a retard.   When you, on principle, value a zygote over a soldier, what do you think you're going to look like? You're gonna' appeal to your creator for some intervention, light a candle for the dead, jabber mindlessly like an Alabama Baptist. You're gonna' have to do some toot and a couple a' shots before you heading out to the lions. You're going to get your ass kicked, George, you might as well break out the Brillo and spark up the Bic NOW.   If Kerry's gotta' wear his religion on his sleeve, at least you know you that sleeve won't be around your neck dragging you to the river. Kerry's got his "family values" and you know he isn't going to tell you to Go Fuck Yourself when you ask him what those values are. At this point, Kerry doesn't need God's help, the Bush camp does, and I don't think God's up to the challenge. If God indeed looks out for idiots, drunks, and little children, then God has got himself a hat trick.

      Today is my friend Usa's birthday and I thought I'd take some time to wish her well. Usa's had a REALLY fucked up year, folks, and she's trying to get back on her feet.   The people Usa worked for were actually pretty cool (by and large); they invented jazz and rock n’ roll and some incredible food (they actually came up with a boatload of cool shit) and although they were always bickering in the company, people seemed to work around it pretty well. Hell, it was a company that was founded on conflict and even though it seemed that it sometimes strived on strife, when everyone put aside their differences, they could pull together and get some incredible shit accomplished.   Christ, I used to work there (until I was let go earlier this year) and I can tell you, it was great. I hated losing my job but I can tell you Usa took it really hard; she was heartbroken. Outsourced, both of us, South American slave labor getting it done. What a load.  Problem is, new management kind of snuck in the backdoor a few years back and started screwing shit up bad. Really bad. And I say “snuck in” because usually people who worked there pretty much decided who would manage. But these bozos just kind of marched in, took over, lied and cajoled and cheated their way into management so they could run things the way THEY wanted.   What was totally fucked up is that nobody really said anything. It was kind of like, “Well these seem like nice guys, we cant get reamed too bad, etc., etc.” Heh.  Next thing you know, 3 million people lose their jobs while the top tier gets a hefty raise (and obscenely good scratch it was). I mean, most of these folks weren’t making the greatest wages but hell, at least they had jobs, they could get by. The slimebags who took over told everyone that by boosting wages for the uppity-ups, the uppity-ups would invest more into the company.   Uh huh. Most of em’ are drunks and perverts and have habits to feed. All they care about is being uppity-ups, fuck the little guy. But that’s not all. The company was in the black just a few years back and the boobs have run it so far into the red, you’d think they were commies. No shit, just like the old U.S.S.R., saying all kinds of phony crap, wacky statements that totally contradict reality, trying to make everything rosy. Yeah, it’s rosy alright - awash in red ink, ya’ turds. Just making shit up as they go along, playing “Lookee’ there” while they lift your wallet.  So you’re thinking, “Yeah, Usa’s hurtin’, we should do something,” and I’m thinkin’ yeah, you haven’t heard the whole story, yet. Stay with me because what I got to tell you about these clowns is simplyfuckingamazing, it’s that insane. Let me finish and then you decide how bad Usa really needs our help.  Usa’s pretty religious, for the most part, but she’s fallen in for some pretty wacky ass crap. I guess a lot of people turn to spirituality when shit’s weird but Usa… well, let me tell you what else went down at the company and you’ll see…  This new management, I mean they’re not even supposed to be there but there they are, and they totally bullshit everybody working there about this other company. You probably heard about those jackoffs hijacking planes and flying them into company buildings (killing over 3,000 people!)? Well, management blamed some company that had nothing to do with it  - and then decided they’d go and do a hostile takeover. But not just buy it out, oh no, no, these crazy fucks decided that people had to die – in both companies!   DIE!!! And for a goddamn LIE!!! What the fuck is THAT?!?  Usa was kind of torn up over that, even though she had been pretty gung-ho about it at first (what with believing the lie and all). Other people in the company were against it from the git-go… and you heard a lot of, “Well, they’re not ‘company men’, they don’t support the company,” horseshit, mostly from management but also the people who were with them.   Hey, fuck that. The people I knew who spoke out against it LOVE the company, looked at the direction the company was going (and how badly things were going), saw through the lie, and asked… “Are you out of your fucking minds?!? Because no one’s taking care of business and important SHIT NEED TO BE DONE. Management wants to piss away MORE money on something that has no justification and… HELLO?!?” Maybe I’m goofy but that sounds like people who have the best interests of the company in mind.   Anyway, as you know, Usa’s always been kinda’ religious, not in-your-face annoying but pretty devout. Well, when new management came in it was with this attitude of, like, “Don’t worry that rules almost as old as the company were broken to get us in here: GOD says we’re supposed to be here!” I guess because they know most of the people there are religious, after a fashion. Blowing smoke up keesters, real televangelist kind of shit, all about the damn money and nothing else.   Pathetic thing is, a lot of people still believe all of it, every lie. Well, maybe not EVERY lie but still willing to… I dunno… I can’t conceive of how anyone with a couple of functioning neurons would still want those worthless twits still running things.   Anyway, things got so bad at the company that the cops were sniffing around about some serious shit, I mean some REAL SERIOUS shit. Embezzlement and giving away company secrets and influence peddling and other stuff, felony don’t-drop-the-soap shit, not just lying about blow jobs in the office kind of kindergarten crap but bus you up the river hard-core stuff. Like Enron  - or like Enron should have been.   So you gotta’ figure that, after all this, Usa would lose it a little to God. Except, now, all these charlatans and false prophets are vying for Usa’s allegiance, trying to prevent her from having an abortion (I won’t go into THAT), telling her she can’t marry a gay partner if she wants to, telling her that she’s the “steward” of the earth and she can do whatever she wants with it… real loony, flat-earth shit. Fortunately, with the way things are going, I don’t know if Usa’s totally buying it.   In the meantime, a lot of Usa’s friends have turned their back on her. She bought into the new management’s bullshit and they’re saying, “We thought you were better than that.” Kinda’ crappy, considering all the good things that Usa has done (she’s bailed out a few friends) but they’ll come around eventually.   Will she get her job back? I don’t know. I do know that if management stays the way it is in the company, there ain’t much hope for her. Management’s already shown that they don’t care what the company does and how it does it, so why would you put your faith in them? Because God is on their side? Uh, well, every religion I’ve ever studied says God likes winners and NOTHING on this management team’s balance sheet shows that they’ve a single goddamn thing.   I think that most of you know Usa and love her like I do. I also think that most of you agree that Usa has had a horrendous year, one of her worst. I believe all of you wish her a much more prosperous, healthy, and sane year ahead.   Swell. You can think all that but you gotta’ DO SOMETHING. Help Usa get her job AND sanity back. If you’re still working at the company, make sure those meatheads in management get shitcanned. Do everything you can to get em’ out of there and I mean EVERYTHING. If the company is going to go back to the way it was and the principles it was founded on – progressive, innovative, egalitarian – and in order for it to continue to prosper, evolve, and provide promise… well, EVERYTHING you can do benefits us all, Usa included.  And if you’re not still with the company… well, I hope you’re OK with that Top Ramen diet.

      Vacation? Nah, nothing to write about. I wasn’t too inspired by the convention and the rest of the news has been nitpicky. I’m just going to indulge in synopses and work on my other blogs…  Terror Alert? To me, that’s a win-win situation for Bush. If nothing happens he can take credit for putting out the alert and preventing potential disaster. If something does happen the rethuglicans will use it as a reason why we need our war time preznit to hold the helm. Look folks, Amurkins are motivated by fear and Dubya’s got us by the balls on that account.  Swift Boat Veterans For the Truth? Sure dudes, I’m going to believe your Fred Flintstone asses. First of all, all the guys who actually served with Kerry on that boat are the ones telling the story, for the most part, NOT Kerry. So you’re calling THEM lairs but you’re too chickenshit to say THAT. And for that, I call you chickenshits. Cowards. Liars.   Secondly, Kerry got THREE Purple Hearts and you’re saying he lied about one of them? I mean really, why lie for one of them when you have two others? “Well, he really wanted that first one” doesn’t fly; earning the other two honestly shows he had the cajones and didn’t need to lie about the first one. And thirdly, a couple of the so-called Swift Boat Veterans have equivocated statements in the ads – I mean they can’t even get their own little bullshit story straight! To Mister and Missus Halfabrain Amurka, this still looks like a Right Wing smear job.   Bad economic news? Only  urlLink 32,000 jobs created, substantially less than the 243,000  that were projected. Of course, Dubya spun it “…the economy has responded to tax cuts and is still growing,” My hunch is (and seems to be backed up by these numbers) that the tax cuts have given rich folk plenty of time to vacation this summer and they’re dropping a wad on snow globes. Unfortunately, they have yet to substantially turn that tax dividend into new jobs or capital investment.   Sadder still is the Bushy response to the news. First Talking Point was BLAME CLINTON… “we were handed this recession by that bad, evil man.” Actually, fuckwits,  the  urlLink 2000 economy was strong until the end of the fourth quarter  and… well, I don’t know if there’s any way to prove this but could the US have been responding to a stolen election? Could consumer and business confidence have been shaken by the fact that their country had suddenly become Nazi Germany? Just asking… but it seems pretty infantile that this administration time and again indulges in finger pointing rather than taking responsibility for its fuck ups.  And the finger pointing persists as the second Talking Point is BLAME 9/11 and begging the question, didn’t 9/11 happen on Bush’s watch? And didn’t Bush ignore the warnings that were handed to him? Do the Democrats not see the opportunity here to bring up the obvious, the conclusions of the 9/11 Commission’s report, the reams of reports from other sources showing that  urlLink Bu$hCo was asleep at the switch … so there’s no use in blaming 9/11?   To rip off The Daily Show, I’m ending this post with a “Moment of Zen”, Bush doing his usual Bush-speak gig at the signing ceremony for a $417 billion defense spending bill.  "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we," Bush said. "They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we."
