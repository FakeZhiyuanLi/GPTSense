      Well I managed to figure some shit out with this blog.  Another day of waiting for people to send me shit so I can finish processing my loans.  But now I am off to the music store for 9.5 hours.  So must take care of shit from there.  In my spare time tomorrow, ha ha, I will need to come in the office for the rest of the shit I need for this other loan.  Tonight I must work out, failed last night.  Luckily I didn't over eat yesterday since I did not manage to workout, but did however manage to drink quite a bit of wine.  Is it Friday yet???

      Well I got an update from Burton on the black out period I had Saturday night.  I don't remember anything after we started to leave comfest.  The last thing I remember is Dan grabbing my cooler for me.  Burt said by the time we got back to the car I dropped down on the grass between my cousins drive way and the street, and apparently was on the phone.  This must be when I was talking to Helen.  Burt had to help me change my clothes, really like put my pants on and get the skirt off.  He said he even had to zip and button up the shit.  That is a bit embarassing, yet funny.  I hope my cousin didn't see me, I would hate to have embarassed him in front of his house.  So on the way to the bar I peed in someones yard, Burt said Robert helped block the view.  Thanks Robert.  Burt said some guy picked me up at the bar and we were doing some crazy dance shit (like literally picked me up.)  I don't remember any of this.  Very sad.  The next thing I remember after leaving comfest was being in the bar thinking I can believe I am standing here dancing right now, and soon after sat down.  I had several men hitting on me, don't know why, can't immagine I looked too good sitting there wanting to throw-up.  This happens to me everytime I go to that place, not as gay a bar as it should be.  Some dude was trying to tell me he wasn't gay (I always enjoy this) but his gay boss was there and he had to make him think he was gay, What?? I asked him to get me water as I couldn't stand, he didn't come through.  So Gerardo (I think that was his name) got me water.  Then I had to get out of there, too much smoke.  Of course you can't leave the bar with water, heaven forbid it is vodka.  So I had to sit thirsty as hell on the curb thing in front of Axis until I was able to stand and walk down to Betty's.  Wasn't too smart of me not to have drank much water all day sat.  I think the severe dehydration did not help my drunken situation.   As for the rest of the day it was great, I saw tons of friends, had a great time.  Was happily shit faced the whole day, until later when I felt sick.  Of course I worked my way through that, and did not get sick.  I am still unable to drink liquor after our last cook-out, but luckily I did not ruin my wine drinking experience Saturday by getting sick.  I don' think I'll be getting drunk for a while however.  But here comes 4th of July weekend.  I could give a shit about it really, only another reason for people to drink, and usually have the day off.  So it is Sunday this year, does me very little good.  I won't have to teach Monday night, but the first week of the month is when we get paid by the students, so I'll have to wait a week for the monday students $$. I am not sure yet if the banks will be open Monday, which could potentially be a pain in the ass.  In the mortgage bus. banks being closed is not beneficial.  Not sure if I have to work at the other job.    In Italy they get 2 days off for their independence day, which is more of a celebration of when Italy unified.  If we are going to have a day off, 2 would be better.  It only took Girabaldi and 1000 men to unify Italy.  We managed to wipe out a good portion of the native population and have a war on our road to "freedom".    Ok time for a bowl then bed.

      So it looks like I will be getting a new cell phone since the assholes want a payment in full, tried to tell me I haven't paid in 90 days, which isn't correct.  Fuck AT&T Wireless.  Or half a payment maybe they will re-activate.  Fuck it.  So new phone will be on the way soon, new number. No more roaming bullshit, there is definitely no roaming charges on the new plan.  This has been a long ass week at work, too many hours.  But I did have a relaxing weekend last weekend, enjoyed the weather.  Hope to have a good weekend this weekend.  Lots of people to see.  So I am ready for the first full week of July when I get paid by all 3 jobs, should be a good week that week.  Barrister still owes me money, don't know if I'll get that.  Don't know who is in charge now, apparently Lisa and Rich are possibly splitting up, so Steve, another bartender, is in charge of scheduling, I don't know about pay, and I don't know why he is in charge.  Lisa was better than him.  Still I liked it better with Rich in charge.  Whatever.  I need to find another bar job.    Anyone going to see Rufus Wainwright next month??? I need to get tickets.   If anyone is interested my cousin Teresa is having a party at her house July 3rd.  There will be a keg and live music, jello shots.  No neighbors to worry about. OK I am outta here.

      Ok haven't had time to blog lately.  First of all the computer has been unhooked at home since molly has been painting and re-doing her room.  Not much time now, at the office cramming shit in between jobs.  The unthinkable has happened, and this week I started back at Dial Hell, 20 hours a week, to make extra $$.  Unfortunately it is the easiest daytime partime job.  If my mom can give me 25 hours of regular store work besides teaching I may consider doing that however.  Problem is I will be gone for the entire month of September, one of their busiess months, and she already has to find subs to teach my students, and would have to have people sub my other hours.  So I may hold off and work there full-time after I get back.  Still doing the mortgage shit on the side, working on loans currently.  So doing that between jobs.  I am thinking of finding another bar/serving job since business at Barrister slows down in the summer.  Not making as much as I was. The next 10 weeks will be shit, but I want to have as much $$$ as possible for my trip to Italy.  When I have a month off all of this will be worth it.  I am still interested in creating some kind of site I can traffic people to to donate $$$ for my travel funds.  It would be nice. Maybe I could donate part of the $$$$ to some charities, so that way I not just a total begger.  OK, I will write more when I have time.    Ciao

      OK, my patience for figuring out how to add shit to my blog lasted about 3 minutes, on top of interuptions from work, etc.  It will be easier if someone shows me how to add shit on, like links, etc.  Maybe this weekend.

      I was reading in Time magazine about these people who make a living off of their blogs.  One guy raised 25,000 dollars in 5 days John Kerry's campaign. Maybe I can make money off of my blog.  I guess I would have to find a way to have that many people actually reading my blog who want to give me money.  One chic had 30,000 visits a month.  I better start making this shit more interesting.  Helen can start her "pimp my ride blog", I can start a "give me money to leave this damn country" blog.  Maybe I can get myself exhiled.  Is it possible for an American citizen to be exhiled?    Another crap day at work, waiting, shit and more shit.  I am leaving after this little update here.  It is nice out, so I need to enjoy some of my day.  At 3 I go for a job interview, I need to do something else soon.  I actually have a job interview Sunday to work for the Democratic National Committee to work on Kerry's campaign.  I'm sure it is canvassing of some sort, but $500 bucks a week, and I would be doing something worth while in the meantime.  Only problem is the time conflicts with teaching.  Teaching the kids pays pretty well, takes up less time.  So we'll see.  I am going to figure out how to update the blog so it is more interesting, if I don't figure it out quickly however, I will be needing someone to show me.  Helen seems to have the most interesting blog setup.  If I am going to make any money it has got to be more interesting (haha).  I am working tonight if anyone wants o visit me at the bar.  The Latino Fest is this weekend, I will probably go down there for a while tomorrow.

      We went to see Super Size Me last night.  It was a great flick, everyone should definitely see it.  It was funny, informative, and well done.  I don't have too much time to get into details, and wouldn't want to ruin it for some of you.  But I highly recommend it, you won't be sorry.   Some good books for reading that relate to the movie are: 1. The Next Trillion (I forget the author, but it speaks a little on our fucked up food industry) 2. Several by John Robbins, A Diet for a New America, and The Food Revolution.  He has also written some others, great books.  He is also briefly in the film. 3. What you Doctor doesn't know about nutrional medicine may be killing you. (don't know the author's name off hand) This book speaks about vitamins and antioxidants and how the lack of them in our diets relate to varying diseases in our society.  You can see from the movie how having a diet relatively free of true nutrients, and that is high in sugar and fat can lead to many of the health problems we have.    OK off to a long ass day at work, and running late.  I don't really care though. Still thinking about quitting soon.

      I had a great time at the festival.  Got a lot of sun, little sleep, saw many good bands, smoked a lot of pot.  It was very relaxing, my back and knee don't even hurt after sleeping on the ground under tress and what not.  I think stress causes tension which helps to contribute to my back pain, maybe it is my shitty bed.  The camping bed I brought is more comfortable.  The ground is more comfortable. I can't wait to go next year.  I have very little desire to be working, and in fact I have already left that place, the internet is down there, need to forward an appraisal, still won't work from home, long story.  I am going to go enjoy the hot weather for a while, then come back and deal with work shit before going to teach.  I am really close to quitting this job after this week.  Bonnaroo gave me time to relax and not think too much, to be honest I could have relaxed more if I didn't still have job stress, but it helped.  Some serious re-evaluating has occured over that past week, now it is time to get it together and prepare for my Italy trip in Settember.   I will try to figure out the link thing, I went to the help screen, I will deal with it later.

      I am having fun here at bonnaroo, I waited forever to get in here to email.  I slept 45 minutes sometime yesterday morning after a long ass drive.  Got some sleep last night but am still tired.  I woke up at 6am central time today and have been out and about.  There is a 24 hour movie tent, we watched clash of the titans.  This internet tent was suppose to open at 9am, but didn't until 9:40, but I was at the beginning of the line.  There are a million grasshoppers at our campsite, crazy.  Those bastards bite too.  The camp neighbor set up this big roof tent thing so we have shade.  He is nice but keeps hitting on me, he is short, so no chance there.  Rachel, this is funny, Gus said I should hook up with Ryan (he's not here) and I started laughing.  He said why not, I said I heard about that shit.  I didn't say it was you I heard about the pencil problem from.  It is suppose to be 90 degrees today, and it is sunny.  The comedy tent has AC so I will be in that shit later.    I went to the template, but it has a bunch of writing in it, no icons, I don't knw how to expain it, like when you get an email that is suppose to be a pic or something and it was sent wrong and it is just writing.  I will try to figure it out.   ok lots of people are waiting, so i am going to get off.  BYE!

      It is starting out to be a long as day.  First here at the office then to the music store.  12 hours!  Still waiting on shit from these banks.  Hope shit gets worked out today because for the next 4 days I will be thinking about very little.  I got shit for sleep last night, unfortunately for myself since we are leaving at 1am tonight to drive to Bonnaroo.  I am going to quit this job after the end of summer.

      Now I have to figure out how this shit works.  Bored here at work waiting for a bunch of idiots to send me shit I need for these damn loans. This job sucks. I was inspired to create a blog by all you that have one.  It is nice and hot today, my kind of day.  I need to get the hell out of here.

      I am at home wasting the free 2 hours I have between jobs, working from home on the mortgage shit.&nbsp; At least I can do it from home.&nbsp; Got the printer/fax all set up here.&nbsp; If I don't have to go into the office then at least that is something.&nbsp; But it would be nice to be out side a little since this is the first day with sun since Saturday.&nbsp; Nice, warm and humid, just how I like it.&nbsp; It sucks working 12 hours a day, by the time I get off it is almost dark, especially since the days are getting shorter.&nbsp; Next summer I really need to work less.&nbsp; Still thinking about what I am going to do when I get back from my trip.&nbsp; I need to either find one good full time job for a while, or work more at the bar, but that wastes my evenings, but the money is good.&nbsp; I definitely want to work less.&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll see.&nbsp; Faxing this shit from home is taking too long.&nbsp; Well need to quickly clean the kithchen and water the plants, and off to more fun!  &nbsp;

      I am tired as hell today and definitely need a nap before I go teach.&nbsp; I have some shit I need to do, but my concerns for all of it are low.&nbsp; I don't feel like mentioning work further than saying it is a pain in my ass.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel like it should be Thurday, but it is only Wednesday.&nbsp; I am looking forward to the weekend for sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK I am too tired to say anything of interest right now, off to nap time.&nbsp;

      Well I decided to call off sick today.&nbsp; Mark decided yesterday he wasn't going, I had the full intensions of going, but when we woke up this morning going in didn't seem too appealing.&nbsp; I still have to teach tonight, and will have to make up the hours Friday, but that's OK.&nbsp; And&nbsp; do a little mortgage shit for maybe an hour.  I had a good weekend, I mostly hung out with Mark, but I saw alot of friends too.&nbsp; Friday we went to dinner and then I had to go work at the bar.&nbsp; Conspiracy played and it was busy as hell, but the time passed&nbsp;quickly and the music was good.&nbsp; Mark, Triple, Adam, Molly and her new man Brian all came to the bar so that was cool.&nbsp; Saturday we took the boys shopping.&nbsp; Brian bought alot of new clothes, so Molly was happy.&nbsp; I picked out some jeans for Mark, and they looked great on him.&nbsp; He picked out a cool shirt on his own at United Colors, and he got new shorts, dark blue.&nbsp; He is up for going shopping again soon.&nbsp; We started to get tired after a while.&nbsp; But we went to Easton and the weather was perfect Saturday so it was nice walking around there.&nbsp;  Sat. evening we went to a cookout at Mark's friend's house.&nbsp; Then we went to Burgandy Room and met up with Lajuane, Triple, Molly, Helen, Ben, and Adam.&nbsp; Then after that we went dancing at Carlisle.&nbsp; The music there is shit, some better than other, but the crowd was OK, and we still had fun dancing anyway.&nbsp; I still prefer to go Latin dancing, which I think I will do tomorrow night.&nbsp; Sunday was relaxing, we went to the Library, the Park of Roses, and then to Triple's parent's house to eat.&nbsp;&nbsp; It almost 11, I think today will pass by quickly too.&nbsp; I definitely need to work out alot today.&nbsp; Ate too much this weekend, along with the drinking Sat.   OK time for a shower.

      Another long ass day of work.&nbsp; I have a ton of shit to accomplish here at the office and not enough time.&nbsp; I will be so glad when I am done with this mortgage shit.&nbsp; This is the last loan I plan on doing, and it will be and has been a pain in my ass.&nbsp; I don't even feel like getting into it execpt to say I can't wait until this shit is finished.&nbsp;&nbsp;The phone is just ringing off the hook here, and I am not answering it.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;   But on to a better subject.&nbsp; The first night Mark and went out we were talking about perfumes and colognes, and I was saying the kinds I like, and which men's colognes I liked.&nbsp; He doesn't (or didn't) wear them, and I am not too concerned about it, but last night we were hanging out and he showered and came down wearing Aqua di Gio.&nbsp; Way to pay attention.&nbsp; That cologne is one of my favs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also he has made efforts to make the sleeping arrangements at his house more comfortable for me, which is also very sweet.&nbsp; My back hurts most of the time and comfortable sleeping is key.&nbsp;   Well must get to work.&nbsp; I will be at Helen's after work for wanton's.&nbsp; I am looking forward to it, and for this day to be over.&nbsp;

      I am in a bit of a pissy mood today.&nbsp; Two very long days of work are getting to me.&nbsp; I can't wait to get home tonight and smoke a bowl, but that won't be until 9pm.&nbsp; It isn't even 2pm yet.&nbsp; I am about ready for this week to be over.&nbsp; I am in the office trying to get shit done, really really not in the mood to socialize today or have people asking me questions about myself to make small talk.&nbsp; A pet pieve of mine anyway, &nbsp;people I don't really know or acquantances, asking me personal questions, or any questions about myself.&nbsp; Look, fuck off, I don't want to talk to you.&nbsp; I am here at the office obviously busy (not too busy to stop to blog however) and&nbsp;a man&nbsp;from a title company stops in and keeps trying to make conversation with me.&nbsp; I tell him, I am really busy, does he get it? No.&nbsp; Finally he left, I think he's bugging Sharon now.&nbsp;&nbsp; I swear, if you are not my friends or family, don't get in my business.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have a drink before I start teaching the children if I wouldn't reak of alcohol.&nbsp; I am teaching longer than normal today, because I had to work at the bar last night so I had to reschedule my Monday students, and shove them into today.&nbsp;&nbsp; To bad I can't just drink through all of the lessons.&nbsp; I would probably be much more pleasant.&nbsp; Ok bad to work.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I though it would be easier to comment in my blog on Helen's statements on marriage and health insurance.&nbsp; I have never personally agreed with legal marriage myself and think it is a bunch of crap for a variety of reasons.&nbsp; Aside from that we shouldn't have to worry about whether or not we can have health care because we do or do not have a spouse and/or same sex partner's health insurance to be covered under.&nbsp; The fact that we have to rely on health insurance in order to go to the doctor pisses me off.&nbsp; I am a big supporter of socialized medicine and we should all have the same benefits and access to health care despite our jobs, marriage, social class, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; The insurance industry controls the quality of our health care, and still doesn't provide the best coverage.&nbsp;&nbsp; God help you if you have a pre-existing condition.&nbsp;  When I had health insurance I was paying just over $100 dollars a month to have 2 doctors visits a year with a $25 dollar co-pay,&nbsp; a prescription decutable of $250, but wait birth control&nbsp;was not included in that,&nbsp; and that is the only prescription drug I ever plan on taking.&nbsp;  If something major would have happened I still would have had to pop $4000 out of my ass to go to the hospital.&nbsp; And I am healthy and don't smoke.&nbsp; Another male music teacher at the store who is 10 years older than me, over weight and smokes had lower health insurance payments.&nbsp; Why? Well because I am a woman and may have children.&nbsp; Oh and thanks for not covering my birth control.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I said fuck it and dropped that shit a year ago.&nbsp; I am not spending $1200 dollars a year so&nbsp;I still have shit medical benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Molly graduated from college and had to go on Cobra until she could find a real job that provides benefits is spending over $400 dollars a month on health insurance, not to mention what she has to pay in co-pays for doctors visits and prescriptions.&nbsp; With her pre-existing conditions if she would have said no to the COBRA insurance and waited to find a job that provided insurance she may not have been able to get insurance or it would still have been extremely high.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  On another note and speaking of Molly, this morning Molly came downstairs and asked me if Mark was in the bathroom, I said no he left, and she said it must be LaJuane then.&nbsp; I thought LaJuane was gone too because I had heard him in the shower earlier in the morning.&nbsp; So she goes up stairs and I hear the water turned on and figured she was in the shower.&nbsp; Like 15 minutes later she come back downstairs bitching about LaJuane being in the bathroom too long.&nbsp; Then a few minutes later I am upstairs and she is like he has been in there for 20 minutes, and I told her I thought he already showered and left.&nbsp; I said knock on the door and tell him to hurry up.&nbsp; So she knocks on the door a few times, no answer and is flipping out because she is late for work.&nbsp; I am pretty positive LaJuane is not home, and wondering what the fuck, with the crazy neighbor we are always a little parinoid.&nbsp; LaJuane's car is not outside, so I called him and he was at work, and I told Molly, he is definitely not in the bathroom.&nbsp; So I ask her, did you turn the water on?&nbsp; Which is what I orginally assumed a half hour earlier.&nbsp; She said I don't think so.&nbsp; So I go in the bathroom, shower is on, steamy as hell in there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe she was still asleep when she did that, I don't know.&nbsp; Lay off the Ambian.&nbsp; She said well I took two last night to sleep, and she couldn't get out of bed this morning, which contributed to the being late factor, aside from the fact she thought LaJuane was in the bathroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Just thought I'd share that.&nbsp; Well must be going.

      Oggi ho deciso a scrivere in italiano cosi voi potete usare Babel Fish.  Benche' le traduzioni di Babel Fish non siano bene.  E anche un'altra dolore nel culo e' devo scrivere volcali con ' separatamente perche' non so come fare tutte e due insieme. Oggi il mio stomaco e' un "bottomless pit".  Ho gia' mangiato tanto, e ancora ho desidero a mangiare.  Ho fatto bene con la dieta questa settimana e con le ginnastiche, e penso il mio corpo non vuole essere piu' magra, e cosi si vuole mangiare di piu'.   Oy Vey! (non italiano)   Ok non ho tanto a dire ora, ho bisogno di camminare un po' prima di ritorno a lavoro.  Godete usare Babel Fish!

      Well we saw farenheit 9/11 last night.  It was good.  Alot of the information I already knew or assumed.  Any one with a brain knows that the whole mess in Iraq is a bunch of bullshit.  But what I really liked was how he explained how the Bush clan is tied up with the Saudi's and their oil.  Saudi Arabia owns 8-9% of the money tied up in american banks.  They own a large part of Citigroup.  I have always thought that the corporation was fairly corupt just on what I know about it.  I remember long before I ever heard about this movie, my stepdad talking about how he read right after 9/11 a bunch of arabs leaving this country with the help of the Bushes.  24 members of the Bin Laden family as the movie indicated.  It is a good movie to see.  However I think almost anyone who would go see the movie would not likely be someone who would ever consider voting for Bush.  Those people are still being brain washed by the Media, the Christian Right, and Bushes adminstration.  Let's just hope this asshole is not re-elected to cause further damage.  But I think he has already done what they forces behind him wanted him to do.  Bush himself is a mindless idiot, and a perfect puppet for those who are really running things behind the scenes.    Also interesting in the Film is when they were addressing the issue of the recount and varying people were speaking to congress as to why it needed to be done.  Al Gore was presiding over this session and was cutting off people who were speaking in his favor for the re-count with the gavel.  Maybe the Bushes paid him off to back off.  Who knows.  We can't trust any of them really.  So if you haven't seen it, I would recommend it.   I still recommend seeing Super Size me as well, you will like this one better.  Funnier and well done.  There are alot of things I dislike about the United States, and seeing farenheit 9/11 helps remind me why I want to leave.

      I am feeling like a slacker this week.  My loan closed yesterday, and other work is needing to be done at the mortgage office, but I am MIA this week.  I don't think my bro is to happy with me right now, but I don't really care.  Tomorrow I need to swing through, it will be my one weekly appearance this week because I am busy with the other jobs and keeping my sanity.  I am trying to care, but have given up on that.  I am getting sick of all this work, same old crap all the time.  Nice hot summer days ruined by meaningless jobs.  But my main concern in life is still having enough money for my trip in september, so that keeps me focused as much as I can be.  A month off will be worth it in the end.    Hung out with Mark last night.  We tried to watch the Butterfly Effect but had a hard time paying attention to it.  Varying distractions and the fact we both like happy, funny, and predictable movies.  I am not sure what the plot was exactly but I have a vague idea.  We missed the end completely, maybe I'll watch it later.  I am mildly curious as to what happened.  Tonight I think we are going to see Farenheit 9/11.  Apparently Mark hasn't seen a movie in a theater in like 5 years.  I think we are going to go to the cinemark theatre over in hilliard.  Student tickets are $3.50 there if you still have your student I.D.  I have never been to that theatre so I hope it isn't too bad.  I prefer the Arena but the movie starts too late there.  OK I must accomplish some things before I leave for work.

      So no one blogs on the weekends huh?  Just getting ready for work at the bar, figured what not blog while I drink my vino.  I enjoyed waking up late today, and not doing much productive, except figuring out my budget for the upcoming trip.  Tomorrow I must go in to the office for a while, the music store, visit G-Ma, and hopefully layout.  I will try to be semi-productive tomorrow.  Jackie was in town for a bit today, and the Family got to hang out for a minute, and meet Molly's new man.  I am happy she is with someone besides Derek. She seems happy.    Hung out with Rachel yesterday which was fun.  We laid out and went shopping.  I can't believe she'll be gone in a month.  It will be weird.  We'll have to put the anytime minutes to good use on the cell phones on weekends.    Ok I should finish getting ready.  Blah.

      Wow the weeks fly by.  Just talking today about Molly burning up shit at home and my fear of the house burning down, to return home from work with all of the windows open because she left some shit on the stove that eventually caught fire and stunk up the house.  So all the windows are opened, but does the AC get turned off I ask you, no it doens't.    Stalkers, Stalkers, Stalkers.  So I found psycho had been calling a few more times than I realized when I filled Molly in on the reason for the home phone # change.  And the neighbor, another crazy, knocked on our door tonight like 2 minutes after I get home, to hand me my house key that he supposedly found in the parking lot in front of our house.  He said someone dropped it, or something.  That is pretty fucking weird I thought, a single key, off the key chain, he found, and somehow knew it was ours.  So we have this rock, fake rock, Molly hid a extra key in in case she looses her keys and gets locked out of the house.  It looks like a rock I guess, it is in the corner in the dirt in front of the house.  Anyway, I look in it and it is empty.  Well the key he "found" obviously came from there.  I asked her if she had used it lately and she said no, I sure as hell haven't.  The only other people I told about it to are Amy and Rachel.  Wait Daniel may know, but I don't think so.  Anyhow, why the fuck is the key on the street, if that is the truth.  Did the neighbor try it out to see if it worked, I would assume so.  Either he is lying or some other pyscho fuck is messing with our shit.  Unless the weird fucking neighbor kids found the rock in the dirt in the corner of the house and porch and decided to take the key out and through it on the ground, I really am at a loss for ideas here.  Good thing LaJuane is staying here.   Hung out with Mark last night, we went to eat at skyliner diner, that's the name of that place right? and hung out afterward.  We are having a good time together.  He is a funny guy.  We get along well, and our personalities seem to click.  Much better than some other recent people.  We had lunch today before he headed down to the All Good Festival for the weekend.  We have seen alot of each other this past week actually, it has been good.    Work still sucks, nothing new there.  Still plotting on ways to make more money.  Next weekend the spamming sessions will begin.  I will have to get this paypal shit setup and the donation link on the blog Sunday or Monday, and then acquire a OSU student directory.    Well need to clean my room up and shower.  Italian phrase for the day: (to those who don't already know this one :)  "non me ne frega un cazzo"  translate that babel fish.

      Ho trovato come mettere un link a babel fish sul mio blog. Ora posso scrivere in italiano e tutti possono usare babel fish a tradurre tutto da italiano a inglese.  Anche voi potete tradurre da inglese a altre lingue. Avete divertimento!

      Don't you like my uncreative titles?  Well I haven't blogged for a while, might as well as I sit here at work waiting for bankers to call me back.  I have a feeling this loan is not going to close tomorrow at the rate these slow fucks are going.  Hope it does since these people had to take the day off in order to have their loan closing.  Hope it works out.  I tried to talk these people into doing it Friday, but they wanted to do it tomorrow.  Still have no hud, since I am still waiting on the clear to close.  The holiday weekend really backed shit up at the bank.  You know who cares about this shit. Work, blaaahhhh.  So anyway that Gerardo psycho managed to find my phone#.  He stopped by a few days ago and left some note on my car and $20 under my mat, for dinner, whatever. My drunk ass ate nachos at Betty's, it was no dinner, I am lucky I remember being there. He didn't even have anything.  I thought it was weird he stopped by, but like Molly said it's $20, you'll never see him again.  Well that was fucking wrong, since I have ran into him several times in the short north, ignored him by the way.  I never gave that guy my ##, I learned it was better not to give that shit out after the "stalker".  So anyway, there was a message from him on the answering machine.  So he managed to find our # which is listed in Molly's name.  The only way to do this is to go online and put in the address to a service that you have to pay a fee to obtain the #.  Well today I had our number changed to an un-published number which will be active starting tomorrow.  I will just call people with this.  And our # won't be showing up on anyones caller ID, and no I never called this guy.  Fucking crazies.  Of course it is my own dumpass fault.  Someone should have better control of me next time I am that drunk.  Of course I don't plan on being that drunk again for a very long time.  So Mark and I have hooked up, not to the suprise of some of you I hear. We are getting along well and had fun together this past weekend.  I am so glad Daniel is done with.  He stopped by Barrister Sat. when I was working, I didn't realy talk to him since I was busy.  He gave me some crazy looks, and then was gone after a while.  I am afraid to be talking shit on my blog, I am afraid someone may locate it.  But I did not give out the blog address to anyone who doesn't already read this, and my sign in name isn't terribly obvious.    Still waiting............  Not much more to say too much work crap on my mind.

      Well I am feeling mildly better today, less anxiety.  Still trying to decide what to do tonight.  My brother is having some cookout thing at his house, and I am still pondering watching the fireworks.  We'll see.  I will be working tomorrow morning for about 3 hours, and at the bar tomorrow night.  But am looking to relax and be outside as much as possible besides.  Well not much to say, want to get the hell out of here!!  For all you on Vacation still have fun!!!

      For some reason I am feeling some high anxiety this week.  I don't know which stressful thing it could be, so many to choose from.  I just keep having this crappy feeling, like something going wrong.  Who knows.  All this work is getting on my nerves, and the mortgage shit is on a day to day basis stressful.  I am used to that.  I really hate it, alot. I will be so happy when this shit is done.  Just need to get through the summer.  I hate having to waste the rest of the summer working like crazy, and it doesn't seem worth it at times.  I just keep telling myself, a month off in Italy.  Hopefully I will have enough.  A month off is costly.  I will be planning shit a little differently for next year when I leave, and will be done with this mortgage shit.  I need to figure out what I want to do when I get back though. A temporary career change may be in store.  I won't be eating too many pot brownies/cookies.  I want to be able to talk still, and not feel retarded.  I really need to have a drink, I need one now.  But have to start teaching the kiddies here in an hour, so that is out.  Can I mention again how much I hate this job??  I am hoping for a relaxing weekend after the work day tomorrow ends.   ok I am getting out of here, maybe I will have time to go home for 10 minutes before the next job, hahaha........

      Well figured I might as well blog quickly.  I have a lot of other shit to do, including showering before going to teach the kids.  At least time is not going by slow as hell today like yesterday.  Going to work an hour late helped.  I am working at the bar tonight and tomorrow night which is good and bad.  Money is always good, but I really don't feel like it.    I don't have too much to say, b/c I have seen all of you this week except for Amy and Rachel,  and really it is the same ol' shit.  Amy, I hope that you are working out a plan to come down here next weekend.  I will find Jack a babysitter if I have to!!  We may just have a few extra part favors with your name on them :)     I checked out the exchange rates today, I now can get 81 euro cents for a dollar instead of 80 cent, who-hoo.  I need to pay my deposit soon, and am watching to see which day I may get the most.  Ok time to go.

      Well not much time to write.  Today is LaJuane's B-day by the way, we are going out for drinks later.  Yes we are having a party on the 21st of August to celebrate all the August birthdays.  I need to start inviting people and getting together the party favors, but my time is limited, so maybe this weekend.  I couldn't find my old resume of course, so I need to do a new one by Friday.  I am going to be applying for various jobs hopefully this Friday, and next.  So the little spare time I have the next few days will be focused on this, and exercising.  I lost 1.5 pounds last week, but gained a pound this weekend.  Ate way way too much, going out to eat, late night eating,  and over at  Triple's parents house, oh and the drinking.    So I am back on track this week and will stay on track this weekend.  Friday I will have to work and Saturday we're heading up to see my Dad's side of the family.  Well, I need to leave for work in 5 mins.  So got to go.

      Well last week was busy as hell at work, and I had no time to blog.  I have a little time now.  I had a good weekend.  I saw many friends and had fun hanging out with everyone.  Too bad the weekends go so fast though.  I am already ready for the weekend again and it is only Monday.  At least I am not working 12 hours today.  Hopefully this loan will close without a hitch on Friday.  The processor is out of town until Wednesday, this better not screw anything up.  I just want this crap to be over with.  I need to get my resume together this week and then next week I am going to be looking for a new job.  Maybe I will get lucky and find something before I leave.  Well I must get back to some mortgage crap now.

      Well I would be in a pissier (is that spelled right?) mood, but I don't have to teach tonight, yeah!  so at least my day will end at a reasonable time.  (however tomorrow will not be so pleasant) It is nice and hot out, so I will be spending sometime outdoors getting some exercise.  Dealing with the loan shit, hopefully everything will go smoothly on this one so it closes next Friday without a hitch, but that never seems to happen, this is probably just wishful thinking.  As for the fuck that owes me $550 in appraisals, he is trying to get out of paying, long story.  This guy doesn't want to fuck with me.  I have signed documents by him stating he will pay these in the advent the loansdon't close, but it looks like we are going to have to send it to collections.  Luckly Jeremy's best friends own a collection agency, and he used to collect when he was younger.    This asshole is really pissing me off.  He makes like $10,000 dollars a month and can't pay his fucking appraisals?  I would like to receive the $$ before I leave for my trip, since my pay was  docked for these fucking appraisals.    Well I have shit to do, so will write more later.
