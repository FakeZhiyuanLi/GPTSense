      What is the most animalistic principle of human life?  The need to continue our species.  As we have evolved, we've added extra components to this, the main one being the need to and to be loved.  Now what if you are completely repulsive to the opposite gender that you are unable to be loved and therefore unable to continue the species?  Surely you have failed as a human and therefore have no purpose in the world.  We are constantly told to be the best we can, do well at work, be sport stars... whatever... but that all means shit if you can't be loved.  Anyone reading this will be 'oh get a grip you'll find someone'... to you people I ask you this... have you EVER been told by someone that they love you? (I don't mean by someone who HAS to say it, like a parent or family member but someone out of their own free will and who's own feelings tell them to say it.) Well for those of you have answered yes to that... well congratulations, sit back in your smug world and laugh at my moment of self pity and realisation that I am a failing human.  In case you've not worked it out I've never heard those words from someone who didn't have to say it... 24 years old and never been loved... to be honest if I did hear those words now I'd probably just not accept that it was truthful, why should it be? Why should all of a sudden things change for me?  Admittedly, not having any self-confidence isn't the most attractive thing in the world and is possibly one of the main factors for my lack of being loved. Just try and work it out though... constantly being told you're good enough to be a friend but not anything else, or not even being given that privilege. Add to that the constant derision and 'jokes' about how you look, I don't think I'm too bad looking not Brad Pitt by any strech of the imagination but not worthy of being on  urlLink mingers.com , yet I've constantly had abuse because as we all know, men with red hair are ugly by default and open to abuse.  I know, ya'll smug bastards out there will be saying I'm making excuses, I've heard all that shit before, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE BEING ME!  The last time I talked to my biological Dad he told me I was a failure... I guess I'm finally realising that he was right.  I believe it was the Manic Street Preachers (or maybe the Manics quoteing the Clash) who said that bands lose their relevance once the band members reach 35. Why should this principle not apply to my life? That's just over 10 years for me to a) find some relevance and b) have a reason to live longer than that.   There 4057 days until I reach 36. Depending upon your outlook on life, that'll either seem like a long time or it won't. To me it just gives me a deadline (quite literally) for me to find my relevance and hopefully stop failing as a human. It also gives me plenty of time to plan my exit.
