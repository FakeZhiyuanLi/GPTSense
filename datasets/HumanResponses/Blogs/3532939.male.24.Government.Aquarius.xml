      Well It's been a busy day...I've finally caught a break at 3:45pm...45 minutes before I'm off of work...lol. Oh well hopefully the rest of the week will go smoothly...Well one of my other practices started yesterday and man I swear we need to put some A/C in the gyms...lol..I'm feeling much better today...I think the stoomach virus has come and gone...thank goodness...Well i guess I have to decide what is going on this weekend....We might hold a few BBQ's, but we are having a huge B-day party for like 3 of my friends and my brother all of their b-days are back to back...so i think from Friday to Tuesday we will be celebrating...hmmmmm...I think we may need a beach type atmosphere...Well see what the kid can cook up!

Well I have some tournaments coming up these next few weekends so I'll be getting back into shape for those...I went to the gym on Sunday when i got back and wrecked shop I was surpirsed that I had only a little bit of rust left...lol...I guess I shook most of it of this past week with all of that running...I got to conitinue this week....Before I forget...HAPPY BELATED BIRTHDAY BRITT....I hope everything turned out well for ya!

      Well today I was extremley busy this morning...I had to change the acid bath and when i say that mess stinks...man my nose is still burning. Well I'm not sure if anyone knows but the NBA draft is tongiht and I'm hoping my man Okefor goes to Orlando... I just heard that Shaq (my favorite player) wants to be traded...and right now the only team that could actually give a good run at him is Dallas...now I like Dallas cause they have Nowitziki and Finley...but if Shaq goes then it's so long Lakers...I'd hate to do it but Kobe can't have his cake and eat it too...I hope it works out that Shaw and McGrady end up on the same team...I decided I was going to take the rest of the day off today and just chill, relax, catch up on some old work, and sip on my Tropical Fruit Fury Twister (my fav). I also found some old songs that i had written a few years ago..man I'm really talented I think I may give this songwriting thing a chance...well see!

      Well it's almost that time for me...Did you all see the new Vibe cover with Brandy...Man I really didn't care for her too much but I had to go buy the magazine just for the cover...she is just too sexy on there....Well I'm just sitting here listening to Public Announcement...remember them? They actually helped R. Kelly blow...well a few years ago they came out with a CD called All work and No play....by far one of my favs...I forgot how much I liked that Cd....no flashbacks to this one...this is just one of the classics that I enjoy listening to. Well I have practice later and I can already tell I'm not in the mood for it today...I guess it'll be cool to see some of my teammates again....Did anyone Buy the Mario Winans Cd? if so let me know how it is....

I'm looking forward to my trip to Italia this weekend but I have a funny feeling I may not go...oh well if not then it looks like I'm off to Holland this weekend...oh yea Basketball practice starts up again tonight...oh well it was a nice two months off...back to the hardcourt!

      Man I swear...I consider myself to be pretty intelligent, witty, bright,,,whatever you want to call it..but there is one thing that I will neverr get...and that's women....Women are the most complex creatures on the planet...they're so indecisive but yet they know what they want. They can tell you to do one thing and be adamant about it but then they switch the script on you and tell you to do the exact opposite making you think your in a trap. Maybe some of you out in Blog world can help me...Can someone please tell me how to figure out a woman's mind? I mean when she says something is it the what it means or is there a subliminal message that we're supposed to decipher? I try I really do but I guess it's just one of those things I'll never come to understand......oh well....

      Well the weather has turned once again...lol...typical German weather. I was going to add some more pics to my webpage today but I decided I'll add them tomorrow...they're really good..and I have to take a few more pic sof my cars as well....you know show you how we do it out over here in Germany...;o) I think today after work I'll go tot he gym...I just got a call this morning from my coach telling me that practice will start again on wednesday...we have a few tournaments over the 4th of July weekend....but I'm still in my off season..lol..I play for two teams so I'll  play in the tournaments but I'm not trying to win them...there is just too much season to try and kill myself before we even start. It's been kind of dead today at work...I think the military had a day off. The funniest thing happened to me today when I went to lunch...I was sitting down at the table by myself (as I do everyday) and I was watching CNN when this girl that just came from Iraq came tot he table to sit with me...she was telling me about all of the stuf they had to overcome over int he desert...but what was funny was that she recognized me fromo BP..lol...she was like I rememeber seeing your pic on Bp and then she asked me what my screen name was..I then told her and she started to break down a little of my history..(well she knew I used to be a teacher and that I was from Tampa)....of course she was injured she had been in a bad humvee accident where the other two people in her hummer had died...she was a really nice young lady and I know I made her day byu just sitting and having a conversation with her...she's off to Texas where she'll be going back to her husband and little boy...Sometimes I think we forget that those soldiers that are in the desert are our age...I hope they all return safely...

      Well it's back at work...lol...man what a relaxing weekend...On friday I got drunk off my ass..lol..I seriously don't rememeber what I was drinking...but I know it was good..;o) It was our (myfriends and I) friends from the states (Dread) first time to a club in Germany so before we rode out we were at the house taking shots, smoking a bit, and playing NCAA 2004...we did that for about a good 3 hours and then hit the club at 1:30am...when we got there we forgot that it was supposed to be a Pajammmy Jam, all we see is little skimpy outfits and whatnot..lol..man so you already know it was a rough night...after we got inside Dread went buck wild...I got him a long island and told him to go hang out for a while...I had to go make my rounds and say what's up to all my folks in the club. when I got back Dread was sweating up a storm and having the time of his life...the Dj then started to play some crunk music; now normally I don't dance (I've gotten to old to be throwing bows) but my crew jumped out on the floor and I did too..man we were out there having a good ol time...after that things started to become a little hazy...we started to drink some more...all I really remember is having so much fun in the club and the ride home...man the ride home was a mess...one of my friends thought it would be cool to see if he could open the door and close it while we were drining at about 160 km about 110 mph...well let's just say the door didn't close back..lol...man imagine 4 drunk fools a sober driver, an open door, rain, and it's like 6:30 am. Lol it was fun......needless to say I slept all day on saturday...in fact i didn't wake up until abou 7pm...I ended up going to my boys house..we talked about the night before..pplayed some cards and watched a Bronx Tale....On Sunday I went to Church...normally I sit in church and I wait for the usual women to catch the "ghost" and start wilding out...but for some reason the preacher was giving a good sermon and a lot of things hit home...it really wasn't about changing your life but about men becoming fathers...how one generations downfalls can follow thorugh many generations...it explained a lot of things that happen in my life that I never knew the answer to. I know when I have children (now how many 24 year old black males can say that?) a lot of things that have been going on in my family for generations will come to a stop...I know I can make the change...  There were also a lot of things the pastor was being hypocritical on as well...how are you going to preach about children misbehaving, not listening, acting the fool and what not...when half the time the parents don't give a damn about the kids..and trust me i know I taught these children for over a year and I know them better than they're parents do..when i was running the Teen center (boys and girls club) those kids never were home...I would ask sometime don't you all eat dinner as a family...why are you all out at 12am? they would always reply ..oh my mom just gives me money to go get something to eat ...or she doesn't care if I'm out....there is seriously something wrong with the family structure now a days..Parents need to watch some of these bad ass kids out here...I''m quick to put these kids in line and they'll tell you...I'll take my belt off in a second...;o)  but other than all of that it was a very peaceful and relaxing weekend...now I can't wait until this weekend...I'm going to Italy on Friday and I'll finally get to go to a beach...man it's been too long since I've been to a beach....you all know I'm an Aquarius so I gotta be near my water...

Oh before I forget...Congratulations Rana, Joe, Jerry, D, Brittany, Train, Ron, and Cheryl...Detroit won I know but I just wanted to say Congrats! (See I can be the bigger man..;o)

      Man it's been a rough morning.....Everyone here has been getting on me about the Lakers....I swear I was the only Laker fan here...lol..I know whent he series first started we were strong in numbers, now it seems as if everyone has jumped on the Piston's Bandwagon..but that's alright I'll bleed purple and gold...but I know they'll be back to win next year...forget all the hoopla about what the nes is saying that the dynasty is going to break up...are you sick? Besides worst case scenario I see Kobe leaving and going to Memphis...but that'll be cool because McGrady wants to leave Orlando and guess who'll have the most money to lure him...LA! Detroit Fans go ahead and wallow, bask, and enjoy this victory because before you know it the Shaq will be hoisting the Golden trophy once again...I was watching the news (as i always do) and I seen that this black guy wanted to blow up a mall in Ohio...now come on people...we can't be doing these white people crimes..lol...I mean damn we're becoming snipers and suicide bombers now...I know we wanted to take over everything but damn! Well let's see today I think I do one of two things...go home and go to sleep..or get into some trouble...lol..for some reason I'm feeling a little devious today...maybe I should play a cruel joke on a detroit fan....hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...;o)

      I'm not sure what the hell happened between Detroit and La but this was supposed to be "the Game" Payton never showed up...and I now truly believe that Karl malone is cursed...he will join Barkley, ewing, stockton,and plenty others that never won a ring because Jordan cursed all of them back in the day...now they can all still come back next year and pull it off but they're going to need a bench and they're going to need that killer instinct that got them their first three rings...I'll give respect where it's due..I'm all about defense when I play basketball so I can appreciate what Detroit has done....savor the moment because you only have 364 more days before you'll have to hand that trophy back to the real champs....;o)

      Well I have about 30 minutes before it's lights out...I guess I'll go work on my game a bit today at the gym...hopefully if I play well i'll bring the Lakers some luck..I'm dead serious if they lose tonight...no one talk to me tomorrow..because I'll really be in a foul mood...I may call in sick...I'm sorry folks but when it comes to basketball I'm really passionate...Man I miss listening to this Cd...I'm doing a little bit of remisicing right now listening to "The Best Man" soundtrack...it brings back a lot of old memories of my real "ex" this was our favorite CD..but I should have paid attention to the words of some of the songs...man they sure tell the truth...oh well even though she is no longer existint in my life whatsoever..I love this CD...especially.."Liar", "As my girl", "the best man I can be"..the whole CD...lol...awwwwww....oh yea Germany play Holland in Soccer tonight...go Deutschland!

      Alright tonight is the moment of truth...I have been praying profousley for Shaq, Kobe, Payton, and Malone to pull one out of their asses...because we need this game and then the momentum swings back in LA's favor...Man I'm so tired today...I was in a boring ass meeting all morning. We discussed what our work will consist of this week and guess what I get to work on some top secret shit...lol..sorry I would tell you all all about it but I gotta keep my lips sealed...The lady that works in our office had her baby yesterday...2ft long and damn near 10lbs...now that's a big baby...lol..well I better appreciate her when she brings himin because your truly isn't having any youngins for a little while...;o) I'm sort of relaxed right now listening to Fortunate by Maxwell...now ya'll know you love that song...Well I guess I should finish this report...I'll be back...;o)

      Man I'm starting to get a sick feeling to my stomach...Kobe is ball hogging like crazy...I mean 8 for 25 shooting is really horrible...hell I could do that with my eyes closed...lol..I hope they get their act together and win these next three games..If they do I want apologies and props for the Lakers for the rest of the year...;o) if they do happen to lose..then I will have to be a man and just admit it...but I'm not giving up hope I'm a Laker fan to the death...Come on Shaq...show'em the diesel!

      Well I've just finished processing samples for the morning...I think my afternoon should be a little slow...which is good because I want to redo my whole blackplanet page..so well see if I can accomplish that today...well this weekend was off the chain...lol...I went out on thurday night but I didn't stay out too long..I seen a girl that used to be infatuatied with me get booed right off of the stage at a dance competition...I must admit it was pretty funny..lol..On friday we had the huge cookout...man there wa soo much food and drink...I think we overdid ourselves..lol..I went to holland earlier that day and I wanted to stay the night but we decided to come back because on saturday we were supposed to go to an amusement park...but the weather was lousy so I decided to sleep in all day...besides I didn't come in from the club on friday night until about 6am...the club was jumping until that late so I wanted to party a bit more..lol...well saturday night I sort of chilled until one of my friends came in the house yelling lets go tot he Natrix....so we went there..it was ok I guess...I'd say they highlight of the night had to be when this guy wanted to win about 250 dollars...so they made him drink 4 cups of spoiled coconut milk and two glasses of vinegar.lol...and then on top of that i think he had to drink a glass of piss...lol...it was really funky because I could smell it on the other side of the club....on sunday...I tried to go to church but I ended up oversleeping...I know I know I feel really bad about it....Well one of my friends had a birthday yesterday as well so we...once again...BBQ'd and had all the fellas come over..play a little nfl streets and spades...some ish talking...and we had to put a few in the air...so overall I'd say it was a pretty nice weekend...only 5 more days until the next one..lol..can't wait!

So my day has been pretty lax you can say...Great time for me to catch up on some past reports....well the Lakers play tongiht and I'm hoping Gary Payton decides to show up tonight and finally prove to everyone that Chauncy Billups is garbage...I mean I know I can defend him and not have him score twenty something points on me...maybe in a few years I'll be able to prove that to people...Well I'm just siting here listening to some old R&B...changing faces...do you mind if I stroke you up? For some strange reason I'm getting back to the early 90's mid 90's music...man we used to jam back then...remember cross coulour and Paco...lol...I'd hate to see pics of me back then...I knwo I was such a dork...but that's alright the ugly duckling turned into a magnificent swan...let me stop..lol..well only about 2 hours left before the weekend begins...oh before I forget...Hey Rana I know your reading this so I just wanted to give you a special shoutout and to let you know I'm trying real hard to come see you...miss ya babygirl!

I was sweating for a minute but I knew my boys would be able to pull it out...I can't wait for game 3....Well it's hot as all hell over here today...I think someone let the devil come to Germany and chill with us for a while because it doesn't get any hotter than 85...well today it's easily 95 and the weatherman said it's going to continue to get warmer...how the hell does it get warmer..lol...more like it'll get up in the eternal damnnation numbers...I just found out that I'll be having a three day weekend this weekend....so you know what that means...we gettin fucked up on friday....lol...I'm talking about from the time we wake up to the time we pass out...My riends and I are all going to go to the pool and BBQ out there on Friday...we'll have drinks, food, music, small bikini's...lol...it'll be a lot of fun..I may take some pics..I think this is the party to start everyone's summer off right! Well yesterday I had a lot of errands to run and I think I accomplished most of them...I do have to wash my car today though.

      For some odd reason I'm not really feeling like myself this morning...I guess I'm having an off day or something...but I do feel like writing something now....hmmmm let's see.....  Betrayal  How do I put into words the hurt and agony you've caused? The many times I've stood by your side, watched your back....only to find out you stuck a knife in mine. Not once, did I forgive, but twice and you still haven't learned form your mistakes...I'm not sure of what to do anymore....Greed is what it seems you live for....can't be content with just the perfect one for you...no no no...you gotta have your cake and eat it too. I should have seen the signs a long time ago but I was naive thinking that our love would grow....but now I know! Trust me; from now on when you claim to be my friend I rather see you as an enemy ...and not speaking any more would be a means to an end!   hmmm I'm not sure if i like it but that's what I was feeling right now....it's sort of hard to explain but for some reason it seems that when I think I have things under control and in my grasp someone I truly care about always comes by and screws it up for me.....I'll be back later...got to go to a meeting...

      Well i finally caught up on all of my work today...sorry I was so busy but they must have had some important mission going on in Uzbekistan (I think that's how you spell it) Well one of our beloved presidents died over the weekend...Ronald Reagan was our 40th president...he served two terms during the 80's...there were many positive and negative outcomes during his terms in office but most notably he started the fall of the soviet union and put an end to the Cold War. Not many people were affected by this war but because of it I was created...my dad joined the military only to come overseas to Germany to meet my mom...they married 3 years before I was born. We moved back to Germany when I was going to elementary school and I must say Europe has really changed a lot...for the better since the beginning of the cold war regime...It took a while and lots of people thought the war would never end but after almost 45 years it finally ended in 1989...Hopefulyl this war on terror will be shorter....

        Man what a weekend....Well let me start from thee beginning...On Friday night my friend calls me telling me that he wants to ride out to Holland.....Him and his wife were having some assuages and he wanted to go blow off some steam so I agree and we ride out....Well we stay until about 10:30pm and then we hit it back home so we can hit the club up...Well by time we get to the club it's packed I mean it's so packed I couldn't park anywhere...So I had to fire one up and take a walk...LOL..well he club was fine there were so many people in there..I chilled most the night danced once or twice but mostly chilled...Well Saturday I slept until about 2pm and then I had all sports of errands to run. I had to wash my car, do some grocery shopping, and I had to mail some bills off..LOL...Well I was finished with everything about 7pm so I decided to stop by my boys house to see if he had gotten into any trouble from the night before...(you know it's funny but I'm starting to think that my friend's wives are a little skeptical of me...hmmm...;o) I'm just trying to help them out I know they have no life being married and everytime I go over the wives always have the "waiting to exhale" group over (this is a group of women maybe 4 or 5 and all they do is talk about how no good men are.) Well I go over being the only single guy and I have to break down to them that look sometimes a man needs a break....Too many women in the house upsets the hormonal balance thus causing tension and resentment throughout the household....I love being right...;o) Well needless to say they didn't understand what I was saying (typical women..LOL) and they wanted to be right so I just agreed and brought my boy with me...We went over to another one of my friends house and played dominos....On Sunday I went to church....No when I go to church I go with good intentions...But the devil was sure moving around in there...LOL...I mean some of the girls really didn't have to wear some of the things they were wearing...LOL...Well after church I see my assistant coach and he's all panicking...Apparently I wasn't informed on this weekend's tournament and they were in the final four with the game starting in&nbsp; about an hour and a half...Well I told him I'd hurry up there as fast as I could...But when I get there it's too late...We were down by 20 with 5 minutes left in the he first half...Well I played the second half and had 10 points and 10 boards but was really limited to what I could do...This was with my Base team and on that team I'm the tallest person everyone else is under 6 ft. So I'm trying to box out and guard four other guys my height&nbsp;and you talk about tiring...LOL..I was popped.        &nbsp;    well&nbsp; I made it to the crib after that...Watched some movie called the "Big Bounce" and fell out...LOL..But the movie was really good...It had Morgan freeman and Owen Wilson...

        Well this morning was a trip...I start my day off shaving in a rush...Which is never a good thing.....So I end up cutting myself...A small cut...But blood was present..LOL...Well as I continue to rush out of the door...I'm tying my shoes and I don't pay attention to where I am and I look up and WHAM......Smacked right into the corner of the door...I had a huge lump and a cut on the bottom of my left eye...It was a pretty good hit..LOL...I could feel it for a while this morning....Well after I iced my eye on the way to work..I'm glad I keep an ice cold sprite with me.....The swelling went down....In fact it's nonexistent now...But I still have a little cut and a scrap under my eye...So I have a band aid on now!        &nbsp;    Not to mention this morning we had a Commanders Call...Lord knows those things are the boringest meetings in the world...Well today was ok ...The commander tried to crack a few jokes...We have an organizational day coming up and we had to vote on who's going in the dunk tank.....Fear factor...And a pie in the face......You already know your boy skated out so quick...LOL...I'm too pretty to get a pie in the face..(I'm kidding) I ain't fallin for the fear factor bull ish and I ain't getting my hair wet in no dunk tank...And that's real...LOL...        &nbsp;    well I have another boring meeting to go to at 3:30pm today and it'll take me until I get off of work today....        &nbsp;    I'm not too sure about this weekend....I'll have to update you on Monday to let you know what has been going on....        &nbsp;    I also want to apologize....I've been really busy lately and haven't had the time to update my blog...But bare with me the writer is back!!!!

      Well today has been pretty busy...at least it made the day go by a bit faster...;o)  I'm so ready to leave...I just found out that if I want I could transfer to Kosovo in April instead of going to the states...now normally I wouldn't even entertain the idea but we're talking about a major promotion if I do go...let's just say Ill be making six figures a year if I do decide to go. I haven't decided on what I'm going to do yet...I still am keeping my options open but the offer is enticing. I think I could sacrifice another year....I mean it's one step closer to my goal of retiring by the age of 33. I also put in a request to be traded from my team so we'll see if anything works out by the end of the summer. There is supposed to be this huge NBA challenge in Cologne this weekend.. I think our team is in...if not I'll bring my own team up....I really don't expect to win against some NBA players but I'm not gonna back down either! I'm up for the challenge (as soon as this groin heals)...well folks I have an hour and a half left.....

      Well it's been a miserable day outside....the weather is just crumby (what the hell was I thinking using that word) I'm telln ya it's so cold out now I swear I just seen a few penguins stroll by and throw me the peace sign...I'm feeling a bit better today...I'm not sneezing as much and my head is a bit clearer....  Well yesterday I went ahead and got my first injury in a while..I pulled my grion. Now I've done it before and let me tell you that it's no fun. I sort of stretched it out but it is really sore./ I'm not sure if I'll be able to play in the tournament this weekend. But we'll see maybe I need to move around a bit more.   Well I need to get my hair braided today and I need to shave...I look a terrible mess today..lol...but that's ok I'll be GQ later on tonight..;o)  Man I just laughed my ass off... you know we're supposed to be working but all of our bosses are in a meeting so we're sitting here watching Chappelle on the net. Man we just seen a sex ed video by him and I swear I was on the floor rolling....  Well I think tonight I'll go out for a bit...I don't think I'm going to drink but I do need to meet up with a few friends to discuss our trip to Prague in a few days...  Well let me get back to the lab before the boss hears us laughing down here....

      Well I've had a semi busy day...it would have been easy had it not been for these damned allergies....I've been sitting at my desk looking pitiful with a box of tissue and a trash can full of used ones...I hate when they get like this...I feel all irritable and uneasy...I have basketball practice today but I really don't feel like going...but I have to go...I got the new Brandy Cd...it's alright...I thought it would be a lot better...but it sounds like typical Brandy...I've also been listening to that Old R. Kelly "12 Play" I'm trying to get some inspiration...but I must admit I like Dave Chapelle's "I'll piss on you" a lot better...;o)

      Well Folks out in Blogger land I have to let you all know about one of the best weekends I've had in months. It all started on Friday after work...I went home and cleaned up a bit (shaved, edged myself upp, washed my hair) then I went to my hair braiders house and she hooked me up...;o) After I got the braids fresh I went over to my man's house and we started to drink...man I tell you some dominoes, Paul Masson, a few J's and we were lit...lol...we strolled in the club around 1:30am fully lit and ready to party...When i stepped in the club things were different...I mean normally I know everyone that's in there but that night there had to be all sorts of new faces...I really don't remember too much but I do remember dancing with all sorts of women...I swear I was being passed around from friend to friend....all of them telling me how cute I am ( like it's something I haven't heard before) After the dancing carousel I had to get me another drink...but I had a basketball game in about 6 or 7 hours so I had to make it a light one...Heineken Brew...;o) Needless to say I don't know what time I left the club or where we went afterwards but I do remember waking up at 10am feeling brand new! I had a basketball tournament in Nieder-Ulm (which is about an hour from me) Our first game was really sloppy...only 6 people showed up (I'd say about 5 out of the 6 were still pretty hungover) and we had to play a pretty good team...needless to say we lost that game...but we lost in overtime playing 5 on 3 ( 2 players fouled out and I was one of them) so we ended up losing by 5 points...oh well first game....had to shake some rust off...I had 9 points and 13 rebounds...  the second game was a lot better...the competition was a lot better which made us play better ...we won the game 63-51...I posted 14points, 11 rebounds, 3 blocks, and 4 assists. not bad since I was still recovering from the hangover and I fouled out (once again) Well after that game we had a long break..so you know ya boy went straight to the car and took a power nap...afterwards we decided to go ahead and eat a bit. We had some sort of steak...man all I can say is that it wass off the chain...I had like 3 of them. As we were eating a few women from one of the girls teams that were there came over to sit with us...they were cool and we found out one of them used to play ball at URI (University of Rhode Island) She really wasn't that cute but it was good to see another American out there...Well we headed to our third game of the day and when we got to the court I almost died laughing...the competition was a joke...they didn't have a guy over 6 foot...lol....so you know I had to take advantage...man I felt like Shaq out there...I'd say it was pretty good until about half way through the first half when one of my teammates shot the ball missed and I caught the rebound and dunked all over there star player...I'm talking nuts in his face tye of dunk...lol..after that he sat down and never came back in the game...we won 88-42 by far the worst ass kicking in the whole tournament...it would have been a lot worse but we were playing around trying to make up dunks and missed a bunch of shots....I had 27 points, 22 rebounds 7 blocks, 9 assists. Well that sums up day one....I'll be back to give you the scoop on what happened that night and the following days when i return from lunch!

      Well that night I went out with a few of my friends...I dind't drink really a few Heinikens but that's about it...we went to the military club. It was ok...it was packed with all sorts of women...for some strange reason we just had a slew of new women come in over the weekend....so once again the dancing carousel was on and poppin...after the club this young lady tried her best to get me to go home with her... I must admit that she was really cute and she seemed like a really nice person...but I told her that I wouldn't respect her in the morning if I went home with her that night...(lol) yea right...;o) For real i told her that I couldn't because of the basketball game I had the next morning...but I told her that we'd go out to dinner sometime. Sunday morning arose and I was sore as hell...I forgot that playing three games in one day can take a toll on your body...our first game was against the home team...I had played against them earlier during the regular season and they knew that I'm one of the only reboundes on my team so they tried to get real physical with me...I swear there were times when I was about to fight...I barely made it through the game...I had 4 fouls before I took myself out of the game....I had to go sit down on the sideline..if I didn't there were going to be consequesnces and reprocussions going on. We ended up beating them by 24..even though the refs cheated and they fouled on every play..13 points, 9 rebounds, 4 blocks, 4 assists. Well that leads us to our Final game. We had about a good four hours to wait so once again...power nap in the back seat of the 7 series...lol...When it was game time oone of our other players (pops) decided to show up...he missed all the games but the final one...lol...he's a mess...well we went into the game knowing that they were going to foul me out and we weren't going to get any calls by the refs...sure enough withing the first ten minutes of play they had called three fouls on me...that really pissed me off....I mean the entire game I'm guarding this big fat nasty , stanking German dude , he had to be about 6'10 275 lbs, and he's constantly using his elbows and hooking....now I'm only 6'6 and I weigh 210lbs so I'm no bodybuilder...lol...but because I can jump so damned high he had a tough time trying to shoot over me...Well I sat down most of the first half...the second half I made it until about 1 left in the game...they called a foul on me for blocking the guys shot...which was a clean block I threw the ball against the back board...well as I sat there trying to explain the the female ref (hmmmm) that it wasn't a foul she just blatantly ignores me...so i call her a bitch under my breath and walk away...well I didn't think she heard me but apparently she did and she gave me a technical foul on top of me being fouled out...I just turned around and laughed at her...I really wanted to take that ball and throw it full force at her...but I figured a smile would hurt her just as hard...well we won the final game on a last second three pointer by one of the veterans on the team...I thought ffor sure it wasn't good but it went through....During the awards ceremony we could tell that everyone there didn't want us to win...we were the only minorities in the whole area so we collected our trophies, champagne, and got the hell out of dodge..lol...but before we left we had to take some of those steaks and beer with us...so we gave the cook about 20 euros and he hooke dus up with like 35 steaks.... When i finally got back into town my firend was having his birthday party/BBQ so I stopped over there for a while and burned a few with him...after we come out of the back room...guess who is over near the grill? The chick from the night before...and she was looking rather enticing with thoe little ass shorts and the belly shirt...completley got my attention...not to mention th victoria secret body spray (love spell) she was wearing...aww man I almost melted...but I had to be cool you know...so i walked over and began talking with her..she was thanking me for not wanting to come over the night before...she said that she had a little too much to think and that she though I was cute and just acted off of impulse...I toold her it was cool and that I'm not the type to take advantage of drunk women...my mama taught me better!  Well we began to chit chat about all sorts of things. she told me that she was only here on TDY and that she would be leaving in two months. She's originally from Greensboro N.C. and that she planned on moving to New York after the military to pursue her singing career...I told her I had a firend that wrote songs (couldn't tell her it was me) and that i would let her see one one day to try out. Before I knew it time had flew by and it was almost 3am.....well I went home and slept all day on monday ...I think I woke up around 3 or 4pm.....went to my man's house and burned a few with him, ate a few ribs and then went to the movies with "the singing girl" we watched Dodgeball....man that is a funny ass movie...lol...I must admit that I really wasn't paying too much attention to what she was saying because I couldn't stop laughing at the movie...Afterwards we went to get some Ice Cream and just sat and talked some more...I then told her that I had to go because I had to be at work at 7am....so I dropped her off and told her that she was a really cool perosn but that I wans't loking for a relationship right now....she said she understood and that she hoped we could be friends...I told her sure...Now I don't know how this woman really acts but from what I've seen so far , she's secure of herself, doesn't argue, laughs, has a pretty smile, and she's a cool person.....but like other females I'm sure the jealous side will appear once I talk to another female...oh well....for now I'm not looking for anything..just going to live life to the fullest and enjoy each day as if it were my last!

      Well I've officially given up on trying to figure out women...lol..I know I've said this before but this is the last straw...;o) naw I'm just going to take a break this weekend and have some fun...You know when you think you've found someone and you try your best to be faithful and caring no matter what the circumstances....but you always have to hear about...who is that girl, why did she do this and why sis she say that? I mean damn if you females aren't secure enough in yourself then why go after a guy? All it does is cause tension and stress.....let me give you a little life story...   I have a friend over here (we'll call him E) ..Well E has been going out with this girl for a little over a year or two...both him and his girl are good old friends of mine...well his girlfriend lives with him and has been for a while....well the day before yesterday he decided to show his ass.....his girl had been nagging and harrassing him for months...because she saw him talking to soem girl int he club...now we all know that it was innocent and nothing was to come out of it....well she never let him live it down...calling him a dog, accusing him of having too many friends, cheating, just your basic insecure female...well after months of hearing this he finally said Fuck it and went and found him someone else...he ended up briniging the new girl to his house....while his old girlfriend was at home...well you can guess what happened next...now I agree the manner in which he chose to pursue this action might have been wrong...but the moral is for you women to stop being so insecure...if you have a man...believe me he is with you for a reason and he's not going to go throw that away...he chose you remember...sometimes a man just gets tired ofanswers the same questions and tired of being accussed of something he didn't do...have you ever heard of self fullfilling prophecy? Well that is what'll happen if you women don't stop.....now I knwo not all men are angels and I can't say that I am either...but I do know that I've been hurt before in a relationship and I don't want to go back through that heartache and pain again...nevertheless cause heartache for my woman.....   oh well I just felt like getting that off of my chest...I think I may go write a song about jealous women....for now I'm thinking about what I'm going to do tonight....can't get too messed up I have 4 games tomorrow....but I know I'm going to have me a good time tonight...it's much needed and much deserved...;o)

      Tracy McGrady is officially a Houston Rocket now...awww man...I was hoping Shaq came back to Orlando...but it's all good Houston will be my second favorite team now...Go Rockets...lol...Well I had a terrible day at practice yesterday...I mean I've never gone a whole practice or game nwithout hitting a jumpshot...and when i say i missed them all...I missed them all (except for 3 dunks but that doesn't count) I think it had to do with the addition of three new players on my team...these guys swear they're Iverson..lol..no defense whatseoever...but that's ook it's still early and trust me by the end of this summer if they're defense doesn't pick up I doubt they'll be playing any...Well I have anotherr eventful night of practice...but this is the last one for the week. We have a pretty big tournament this weekend in Nieder-Ulm, where we get to face at least two of the teams we'll be playing this year...I predict we come out on top unscathed...but you never want to be too cautious (look at my lakers)!
