      Tomorrow my parents are making me drive to Wisconsin, which means I have to drive on the freeway and merge with all the trucks and cars going 65 mph!  That will not be good.  Well I guess everyone has to have a first time.

      wow group blog! so exciting. i was lucky enough to have this webpage load after about 20-30 minutes. our movie/starbucks/funky munky extravagant escapade was superb. i love harry potter. well actually rupert but thats not the point. i'm so incredibly happy that school is over. man now that i have an oppurtunity to blog i cant think of things to say. saturday is the car wash and the despite popular belief/diminished concert! driver's ed is almost over and im happy about that. im afraid of the approaching texas vacation. i won't have contact with anyone for  2 weeks  yikes. too much togetherness if you ask me. but my input doesn't count in my family. so i have to go. next year of school will most likely be better. i have a feeling that some of the incoming freshman will try to rebel and overthrow the hierarchy that is jacobs high school. it will be funny. and annoying. i think we need to go to an ashby furlough concert very soon because i miss them. well thats all from me for now, who knows when i shall post again. adios

      HOLA! i am home and so is katy! we are going to save this blog! the mission trip was beyond what i thought it would be. my normal blog is up and running again because i am on my laptop and it is faster than my normal computer. i'm so pleased to be blogging again. it's a good feeling. i'm slightly looking forward to school because i want to see people again and try to make new friends and be a better person this year. looking back at last year, i didn't try to find the good stuff. i just decided everything sucked and there was no way to change it. but i was wrong. so hopefully this year i can be more joyful and cheery even in those early mornings at the bus stop and 1st block. it hurts me to think about it though. sigh i need my copeland CD back from val. Oohh and i may be getting my pictures developed today! and cheryl said she is going to try and have a picture party and i think it would be cool if you all came and checked it out because it was so great. so i will be calling you all in the near future because aside from just having a shindig, i believe that PAPRIKA NACHO DAY IS A-COMING!&nbsp; (note-paprika nacho day was invented by none other than kate kirkish and myself, meghan keyes, and doesn't yet have a set date) But anyways, this holiday will be celebrated by EVERYONE and i mean   everyone   so expect either me or kate to call you with a date. betsy's and miles's birthdays are coming too and i need to try and get/make them something. i like making presents because it is way more fun and thoughtful but it's hard to think of a good thing. so! i am going to do other things now.   adios amigos!

Califrniadrmin21 [1:22 PM]:  no   SantaClaus [1:22 PM]:  The elves and I are just asking so that we can better understand what you're saying, that's all.   Califrniadrmin21 [1:22 PM]:  okay then   SantaClaus [1:22 PM]:  You got it! That's great!   Califrniadrmin21 [1:22 PM]:  I am confused by u    SantaClaus [1:22 PM]:  Mm hm.   Califrniadrmin21 [1:23 PM]:  so whats ur favorite movie?   SantaClaus [1:23 PM]:  Oh, I cannot pick a favorite. ;-)   Califrniadrmin21 [1:23 PM]:  whats ur favorite reindeer?   SantaClaus [1:23 PM]:  Santa doesn't play favorites when it comes to the reindeer. I love them all equally. ;-)   Califrniadrmin21 [1:23 PM]:  its rudolph isnt it   SantaClaus [1:23 PM]:  All the reindeer are doing fine. They're very excited! :-)    Califrniadrmin21 [1:23 PM]:  I knew it    SantaClaus [1:23 PM]:  Oh, Dear. It's the elves again isn't it? Try typing "To Do"; I've got a plan to get you in the Christmas spirit.   Califrniadrmin21 [1:23 PM]:  What about the reindeer?   SantaClaus [1:23 PM]:  Hmm... What, what?   Califrniadrmin21 [1:23 PM]:  How could u just forget them    SantaClaus [1:23 PM]:  Oh dear, how should I know?   Califrniadrmin21 [1:24 PM]:  u always r thinkin of urself, santa   SantaClaus [1:24 PM]:  Well you could try putting your finger on the side of your nose -- but it took me 400 years of practice. ;-)   Califrniadrmin21 [1:24 PM]:  what are you talking about? trying to change the subject eh?   SantaClaus [1:24 PM]:  Oh dear, I am Father Christmas. You really don't remember me?   Califrniadrmin21 [1:24 PM]:  Um Yeah i know who you are    SantaClaus [1:24 PM]:  You are the same child you were when I first visited you. Same spirit inside.   Califrniadrmin21 [1:24 PM]:  Sure..   SantaClaus [1:24 PM]:  Without a doubt.   Califrniadrmin21 [1:24 PM]:  yeah so anyways back to my life    SantaClaus [1:24 PM]:  Yes.   Califrniadrmin21 [1:24 PM]:  do u like me?   SantaClaus [1:24 PM]:  It depends if Christmas is coming or not. ;-)   Califrniadrmin21 [1:25 PM]:  What ? that doesnt make sense   SantaClaus [1:25 PM]:  What, indeed!   Califrniadrmin21 [1:25 PM]:  um no'   SantaClaus [1:25 PM]:  Alright now. I'm here to spread Christmas cheer -- so use this time wisely and type carefully. ;-) Here's quick way to get in the Christmas spirit; type, "To Do".   Califrniadrmin21 [1:25 PM]:  i dont think so    SantaClaus [1:25 PM]:  Well, we won't get very far with this conversation then will we?

      eh thanksgiving isnt much fun if u think about..its too much family time and i always feel sick after i eat but im expected to be happy and wonderful for every1 and i feel like sleeping..... tryptophan i tell u. so my brother got a bass guitar and i got $50. so i asked for an electric guitar cuz i already have an acoustic. i could play my dads, which is what i do know, but its his and expensive and he thinks i might break it or something. which is likely. so i will hopefully have an electric guitar for christmas! yay! and it will hopefully be a good one. oh well if it isnt i guess.

      "the ancient Egyptian farmers believed that when they harvested their corn, they should weep and be grief-stricken. This was to deceive the spirit which they believed lived in the corn. They feared the spirit would become angry when the farmers cut down the corn in which they lived." http://www.holidays.net/thanksgiving/story.htm

      the talon was sad today. it just wasnt as good as usual. miles didnt really criticize any1 and the other articles were reeeally repetitive. and pretty boring. theres too many sports articles. and PT was in there like twice and i hate PT so it was gross. (pt meaning pierre thorsen) jeff meyer said funny things about tracy today, it was interesting hearing some1 who actually went to her school talk about her and tell how she acted and stuff. cuz i dont really know many people that do go to her school. i just know a few girls who uh dont like her much and now jeff. its just different.

      i didnt burn my board because i wasnt allowed to. friday i went to noodles and funky munky ( i bought the coolest ring ever) and starbucks with meghan and katy and then those 2 and betsy came over and we played disney trivia and i showed em my yoga moves and we looked at colin farrell. then katy changed the disney game and we all lost our voices and then watched that 70s show and they went home. today i slept in and went ot the mall with my mom for christmas lists and i think im getting alot of good stuff. i know for sure i got a rolling stones shirt. omg i asked for the best pjs ever..they r led zeppelin and they have a shirt that says "led zeppelin"and has some little pictures inside them and then has little shorts with the pictures on them. they r wonderful and awesome. i got a skirt to wear on christmas that is really cute, its pink then it has a sheer black lacey thing over it.  yeah.

      okay aside from the fact im a total nerd (see yesterdays entries) life is boring. i had to present my science fair board and every single time i have to present something by myself, for some reason i turn bright red. i hate it with a passion but i do and i cant do anything about. then everyone feels the need to tell me. even though i know.  I HAVE SCIENCE FAIR TONIGHT AND I HAAAAAAATE IT WITH A PASSION AND I WANT IT TO DIE. IM BURNING MY BOARD AND PAPER AS SOON AS I GET HOME NO QUESTIONS ASKED. THERE IS NO WAY IM GOIN ON ANYWHERE, I DONT CARE IF ITS NATIONALS! sigh. just had to get that out.

      just a thought- if life were like the sims....... i would be the happiest person u ever met. my love would be in love with me, we would have happy little children. any1 i didnt like would be put into a swimming pool to meet their death. you could bargain with the grim reaper. fires are the most common cause of death. you never have to drive anywhere. you can be any job you want regardless of college. NO HOMEWORK. to get promoted all u have to do is work out a little and read a few books.  ----you would never ever grow old.-----    just a thought.

      "some people" in my guitar class are mad cuz we r playing chords and scales. they think we should already be playing whole songs. those same people cant read music to save their lives. they dont know what a dotted quarter note gets (count wise) and they cant read the notes on a treble clef. how do they expect to be able to play anything at all if they cant even read music??

      i have just been feeling... very sad. i know why and it isnt anything serious. i feel like everything is over. done. nothing left to do or look forward to. christmas and timber-lee were my thoughts for the past month. i want to see jon andy joel and joe again. and talk to them. now what? nothing i tell you. i must find something.

      i do not understand how people can live without God in their life. He is so incredible. He gives a point to life, something to live for. without it, whats the point? how can people who dont believe get along in life? they have no one to trust, talk to, or just know they love them. seems sad to me.

      this weekend has been one of the best of my life. i went to timber-lee for a weekend camp (winter xtreme) i go every year. the band  urlLink Ashby Furlough  was so hot i could not stand it. honestly, they were so nice and sweet. we were going to play broomball with them but the counselors/referees wouldnt let them so instead they were our fans. they were very hot. i took some pictures and really want them developed but my mom isnt home. then there was the culprit and the culprits and jeremiah and his story and karaoke and everything just feels so wonderful and right..its sad though. i dont know when i will see them again.

      this day has been too long too boring and just plain old stupid. i have nothing to do so i either go online (or play some computer game), think, watch tv or eat. i just sit thinking about christmas and happiness. because right now i have absolutely nothing better to do. i realized i had a fun game though. i forgot i had it and its addictive. its called pharaoh. its exactly like age of empires except it is all egyptian. eh. oh well. im goin to sleep in till 12 again.

      the madrigal dinner was really cool. it was alot different then what i thought it was going to be. it was actually fun. they decorated the commons all pretty like a castle. it wasnt a total waste of a night... then i had to wake up for church though and that was tough. i havent been able to sleep enough yet and it is makin me "crabby", thats what my mom said. but that isnt my problem now is it..

      i hate this weekend. it is one of those i have to do what my family wants cuz its better than what i want to do. example- babysitting last night, play rehearsal this morning, madrigal dinner tonight, tomorrow i have to perform that play. i dont really want to do any of those things. but i havce to mostly because my mom decided i should. not me, her.

      today has no value. it is just another basic day with nothing exciting. like every other day. i have to babysit b/c my mom decided for me that i have to. she just told the person i would without asking me so now i have to. and that means i cant do anything. which is terrible. then tomorrow im playin at madrigals. which means no night time fun. I HATE BEING BUSY ALL THE TIME

      had a funny conversation w/ sam today about how we dont like winter and how summer is better. we both like summer nights when the temperature is perfect and ur free to stay out and do whatever u want to. we hate how in winter all u can do is basically ski or snowboard otherwise ur inside all the time and no1 ever wants to do anything. it was interesting. then he found a pin by his house that said "Hoofbeats-My favorite music"

      Okay if anyone watches average joe, she picked the wrong man. obviously. so i hope that her and her pretty boy r happy. katy u shouldnt judge adam on his appearence. argh people r gettin on my nerves. not specifically certain people just the way people are. it seems like there arent people experiencing what im going through. i dont mean to sound like whiny or that i dont like my friends because i love them and they do what they can. i just feel like i cant say what i want to other people. i think i care too much about what other people think about me. i wish  i could just say what i wanted to whoever and be done with it. and then not care if those people thought i was really weird. sigh..im just a confused soul..

      sry  betsy about posting that....  today was .. funny u could say. some1 was wearin a tunic that made me chuckle. haha that sounds stupid but its just something i think is funny. tunics r hilarious. they r so weird looking but everybody has them. then in orchestra hot drummers came in and they r playin w/ us in our concert. BuT one was in jazz band and couldnt go. sooo yeah. and i had string ensemble and it was okay i guess. elyse is the only person that i talk to the rest think they r better than us or something just cuz we r freshman. oh well. gym class tomorrow! ! i actually like gym. last year i hated it with a passion and always had a way out of it. this year i basically look forward to it. not to mention we r playin volleyball. i cannot wait till we start the peace club!!!!!!!!!! yahoo!

      whoa well it took me about half an hour but i can play a bit of stairway to heaven. im not allowed to print out the whole thing cuz its 15 pages so i only have 4. but i can play the first 1 1/2. so i took a break. cuz i have to practice for string ensemble too. ick i really dont like orchestra this year.anyways today in gym it was great. i got hit 3 times and we were getting into it and then we lost a player to injuries. so the person in front had to play the whole front area and it was great i dove for a few and idk but it was real fun. it was tied alot and we ended up winning because i missed a ball...lol if i had hit it we probly would have lost. but hey it was great fun. my gym stories r always really boring to every1 else but i love em. im gonna ask to be in ledfords class all 4 years cuz i will  always get an A and i love it. its the easiest gym class i have ever had. seriously.

      today was finals and finals are useless. i am pretty sure i didnt do good on my history final and orchestra was pretty easy. "someone" showed me their drugs at school today..it made me feel sick. drugs seem so stupid and harmful that i dont know how people can do it. i guess you just have to really want to do them, and be rich. Anyways i am totally happy to be going to the concert tonight. it will be very fun, i can tell. if it isnt i will be shocked. but i mean come on chris will be there and that makes it fun!

      finals are muy stupido. i believe that means very stupid. im not in spanish yet. but anyways. i went to church tonight and it was only me tracy dann nicole and brittny. so i must say it was fairly boring. we watched a video about this guy falling off a rock and getting hurt and how God gave him a miracle. it was pretty amazing. umm i cant wait till friday alot. i dont want my brother talk to joel. so i wont at all mention it. at all. (he is going to timber-lee this weekend). yes because he would say something ummmm along the lines of "my sister thinks your hot" and it would not be good considering he will be here in 35 days. i am counting down. its a month till my birthdaaaaaaay

      if finals were only over the major stuff we learned i would ace them. but they arent. they are about stupid little facts i would never remember then i end up getting a C on it.  all because of teachers. and then thorsen told us he isnt reviewing. isnt that nice. all i know is that it is over the french revolution to world war 2.

      phew well sorry i havent posted but its been a little crazy.. sunday nights i went skiing which was pretty good. it was very very very cold and windy and i felt like i was going to be frozen a few times. i have nice bruises though. i love bruises. then katy and meghan slept over but we didnt do anything because i was dead tired. seriously i still am. monday i just layed around and did my homework. we were going to go to the thrift store but it got postponed to this weekend. along with the despite popular belief concert. which i am extremely excited about. especially since the other concert (l.z.) got screwed up thanks to Matthew.  so now i really wanna go. i hate finals i hate finals i hate hate hate them. pointless useless stupid waste of time. i want to burn every single one.

"baby bash" was there, i have never heard of him but alot of people were being psychotic and annoying about him. he is some sort of rapper. eh. oh well.

      no jonny for me. my mom wont drive. eh i will see him eventually. just not anytime soon. anyways guitar is almost over and i cant believe that i can play. its so happy. i can play most of the song good riddance (time of your life) by green day AND sing along. well the singing is lacking and i cant play the beginning but its a start! i can read tabs well so it makes it a ton easier to learn but sometimes i dont know what the rhythm is so i have to try and download the song. which isnt fun. but all in all, guitar is good. so take it.

      wow i'm sorry that i havent said anything in so long..  i got incredibly great pictures of andy and jon from tracy. they are hot stuff. next week im (most likely) going to one of jon's concerts! i am very excited about that. of course. i wanted to go tonight to their starbucks concert but my mom said that would be impossible because no one wants to drive to lake geneva without warning. so we are going to a movie instead. i went shopping today. last night i went to betsys because everyone elses parents wouldnt let them go to the silent fighting/ourselves/the famous hiyah concert. im not sure why. but anyways i was psycho and we dressed up. i was a hobo pirate. then we did each others hair and make up. i am sure we were hotties. we even got her brother to get on the fun. so we made a music video for a strong bad song. it was hilarious. aaand yes. i dont know. have a magical day

      floor hockey is the best sport that we play in gym i believe. its like anger management for free. you just run around hitting a ball or a person with a stick! and its legal! pure genius. and i get some nice bruises too. bruises are like conversation starters. they are really cool. im not sure why but im in a pretty good mood. yay. im trying to think of something to say...  oahu tree snails= awesome.

      meggie got an email from the band and she told me what it said and although it was funny, it was terribly sad. jon said that he thought the only weekends he was playing next year at timber-lee were junior high. which i started thinking about (of course) and then it just kept going and i got so sad. if i never see them again i would be devastated..

      another wonderful thing i have thought about in thorough detail today-  my parents are 8-9 years apart in age. soo i could marry someone that is 22-23 years old without any difficulty. That is a wonderful thought. :)

      okay two things- 1.) i watched queer eye for the straight guy last night. it was hilarious. i feel bad for the straight guy because there are 5 gay guys hitting on him and it is probably overwhelming. i noticed that. and that the straight guy never really gets it all together for whatever event he is doing.  2.) "some1" said something today at flex that really got me thinking... "you are praying for nonsense" That sentence is a pure lie because anything you pray for isn't nonsense because you yourself believe in it enough to tell God about it. That alone makes it make sense. Even if it something that doesn't make sense to others, it does to you. It is impossible to pray for nonsense. When you really think about it, it is actually rude to say.

      well lucky us we had school and it was stupid and i hate it just as much as i thought i would.    ashby furlough emailed me back again..well it was jon but he said it was on behalf of the band. :) It made my day a whole lot better. because it was pretty much stinky. literally. ever notice how much jacobs smells? it does. i had a bad time today. i wont use any names. but anyways these two people were having a nice little conversation about doing drugs, doing it with people, stealing, drinking and porn. it just made me think about how truly terrible some people are no matter what they look like. i just sat there and became so sad. if that makes me this sad God must be crying. He doesnt want people to act like that but it is their choice i guess. it just seemed so wrong to me..

      i have had a fun little weekend. we had this nonstop monopoly extravaganza until 3:15 a.m. it was spectacular. we played chicago monopoly, pokemon monopoly and monopoly junior. it was special. i went sledding today with betsy! we got garbage bags and put leg holes in them and then sled on our butts and stomachs. i looked like a penguin/marshmallow. it was grand. farewell till tomorrow..

      what is truly an obsession? people always say they are obsessed with johnny depp or the o.c. but that isnt really an obsession, you just like that alot. i think an obsession is like something taking over your life. it has to be all you think about. why am i even talking about this?

      i got a little email from the band.. it made me happy for a few minutes. i went to b's for new years. it was a grand ol time. we had magnum poppers. they r basically confetti guns. they really shouldnt sell those. little kids would shoot people. oh well i like them. we stayed up late. i wrote something last night! its really quite bad. you will know what it means if you know what i mean.  you never know what to expect on that endless drive once you're there you can just feel it.  energy and love  for the same reason. God. you feel together getting to know each other all over again. new friends join in Even if they arent allowed. ;) In the back of your mind that small feeling  you know you have to leave. And just maybe never see them again. it draws closer but seems far away. Then its over. Back in the car trying desperately to keep memories. you dont want them to fade. convincing yourself  you will see them again.  A year  thats all you have to wait. its not that long...  its a bad thing. i wont call it a poem because it isnt. i was bored at midnight last night so i turned on a CD (take a wild guess which one) and wrote all my feelings and stuff like that. happy new year.

      i forgot to talk about my duct tape jeans. i put duct tape on my jeans and wrote ashby furlough on it and andy wanted to buy them and then he goes "hey jonny t. you gotta do the duct tape next time!" and when we talked to andy he told us why he plays in socks and that jonny always wears red shoes because they are good luck.

      okay so after that.. we made a paper chain and then we watched bruce almighty. i fell asleep but i really wanted to see it. oh well. then i slept in but was awakened by billy kuhns talking about food, swishing, and playing a drum. not exactly fun. okay lets see..um..i dont really remember what else we did..but we broke the fast with communion...it was really sweet and meaningful. and then i went to betsy's after eating like 20 pounds of food. i was there for like six hours. haha. we watched her ashby furlough footage. it was nice. and then we talked to her sister who is the luckiest person in the world because she got to meet switchfoot. ahh. i want to meet them. anyways we watched it alot and listened to music and looked at yearbooks. and then the toaster caught on fire. it was hilarious.

      oooooooooh this will be a long post. famining wasnt too hard, today was pretty tough but i think yesterday was harder. i absolutely love ashby furlough. sorry but i do. andy came at 6 and i got to hug him and then the other guys came and we unloaded their cars. i got to climb in andy's car and unload his bass. so hot. and then i got to carry in a drum. of joes. who is also hot. then i got to take their orders for scoobysa and they were really nice. joe asked me what my name was then. he is actually really really nice. last time i didnt talk to him. they played and they were amazing and awesome and spectacular and (insert an adj. that means good). and extremely hot. i love when jon dances. its soo cute. and i love um everything that andy does. they played this song i really love and andy was like she was on my broomball team and he high fived me. so so so hot. then after the concert me and betsy got to talk to andy for like half an hour. he was really nice. he wanted to buy my pants and then trade shirts with me. but then i found out he was married. and i wanted to cry. but he is so sweet. oh and i took a picture with them and joe said hey its meghan! i remember your name! and i was like yeah! i love you! (not really, hes married and has children.) soo anyways we got to pack the cars back up and i hugged them all goodbye. jon was sweaty, joe smelled good, andy was hot and joel was trying to whip me with a towel. they drove the cutest minivans. ever. we were inside after and andy pulled up and i opened the door and he yells "hey we're getting some food want anything?" (note- this is during the famine) so i yelled "come on dont even" and then he said im just kidding.. and then he drove a little and then he said actually im not. that was the last i saw of them. ya know ill post again the rest cuz this is so long.

      now back to today.. half day.. um......aric was either joking, being mean, or playing hard to get and made me quite sad. but i dont really care about him because i barely know him. hes just a drummer. wait ... just a drummer? man thats pretty hypocritical. that word sounds so smart. hmm anyways umm i dont have a quote of the day yet because no one said anything funny weird or anything. i barely talked to people today. strange. maybe later.

      the passion is a movie that you will either love or hate. i really dont think you can be in the middle. i could be wrong. if you dont know the story of jesus, read it before you go, otherwise you will have no idea what is happening and mostly why it is happening. i cried from the time they whipped him until the end. if i wasnt crying, i was shaking. i want to see it again. that movie makes you think about how Jesus did that for me, for us. He went through the worst pain you can think of just so we can go to heaven and be with him. i dont really know how to put into words the feelings i had because they were so .. amazing.

      well i returned to jacobs today. it was mostly good. i was blessed with a talon (great job miles) and aric butler waving to me in the hallway. my group in kobza, however, was not so blessed and chose not to do anything meghan or myself said. soo we have to present tomorrow with next to nothing. (i like this intelligent talking im doing...must be the medicine..) i was out of gym and some nice jacobians let me play cards with them. fairly good way to spend gym might i add. math was stupid spanish was usual. that mostly when i read the talon. and now for the  Quote of the Day  "You are incapable of having a normal discussion because you are too wrapped up in yourselves." Mrs. Taylor to my fellow Spanish classmates. aint it the truth

      i will try to put these amazing pants into words. they are jeans, and they are medium-dark and tight. they flare out a little bit at the bottom. they were so tight you could see his calf muscles as he walked out onto the crowd..yeah he crowd surfed but he was walking. it was amazing. so now i want to go to the concert and support him in his crowdsurfing..so   amazing.

      this weekend has been just crazy. sunday i went to church then i had to go to my great aunts birthday. then i got home with a half an hour to spare before skiing which meant i was running around throwing things and then getting yelled at which made me late. skiing was great, the very last run me and meghan finally got on the biggest hill in the park and it was fun but incredibly scary. but i survived. then we went to the hotel. it was funny. we wanted to swim but it was locked and tracy and britt ate bananas and threw them in this candle and we ran around dancing in the hallways (this is at midnight) so then we were called in our room and told to be quiet. we didnt do much else. in the morning we went in the hot tub becuz of our muscles and then we had breakfast. i ate too much. then we went home. i got to go to guitar center and pick out this gorgeous acoustic guitar for my birthday but i hafta pay for part of it. but it is beautiful.

      my day improved as time went by. miles said nice things that made me happy and other things that made me think. alot. then i went out to dinner with the family. which is always an experience. the food didnt come for about an hour so i was putting my head down on the table so they thought i was like sick or something. then i only ate three bites of my burger. it was 9:30 at night, i wasnt hungry. but no im anorexic now. apparently. at least i have a family and food. and a house. good night.

      i accidently left it on all night......eh. the basketball game was fun, aric is hot. ha. we went to betsys after and it was grand, even though we just talked the whole time. but thats why we are friends. because we can sit and talk and not hafta worry about what we're saying. sooo i think i have to go to the mall because my brother is in some sort of gaming tournament there. which is so disgusting. ha actually i dont care what hes doing as long as it doesnt involve me or my friends. usually it does. soooo umm i guess thats it.

      in st. lucia they make this beer for kids. it has less alcohol than regular beer and its flavored. i had some. it didnt taste that bad but i dont know its so strange that things like that are legal. there isnt any law against drinking and driving in any place i went except puerto rico. the whole trip made me think alot about how lucky and well-off i am to have a family that loves me and is able to go on vacation.

Cuz I don't belong here Please Won't you let me down?  --switchfoot.

      today was a pretty good day. but it wasnt as good as it could have been. miles was styling in his green pants. he also took pictures of orchestra. i smiled at aric butler twice today. hurray. kind of. sugg's backpack said either " i hate christians" or "down with christians". i dis-heart him now. blah. then in espanol we had a conversation about parents and how nowadays they dont care as much and how if parents were jsut a little more inquisitive and strict kids wouldnt get into as many problems and drugs and such.

      i was thinking about meghan and greg with the hair's argument about heaven and there is a heaven, despite what he says. there has to be something after we die, i mean we dont just die and be done. we go somehwhere else, do something else. i guess if you dont believe in God you might see things quite differently but i cant see where we would just die and that is the end. i could be wrong, but i doubt it. God is there and in control. and once you die, you get to meet him. this is hard to think about.

      so first betsy's backpack was stuck in her locker and she couldnt get it out so she had to carry her books. so we ran downstairs and talked to miles, who was one of many who enjoyed my anaranjado pantalones. so we ran outside cuz our bus is usually first and we were a bit late. but we didnt see it so we waited for the second line of buses to pull up but we didnt see it. so then we (me natalie betsy and sam) waited awhile, realized no one else from our bus was still at school, and decided to call. well sam was talking to people i dislike greatly and wont talk about..but anyways, mrs. melchers was gonna pick us up so she drove sam home too. a bit uncomfortable.

      i was doing my math homework in espanol and not exactly paying attention and then i just caught a bit of what ms. taylor was saying and it was something about rap music. so i started listening and they were talking about how words have changed meaning. like gay used to mean happy, certain words used in rap music used to mean female dog and how terrible it is that these words have become so common and it doesnt affect people when they are used nowadays. and it really is true. you walk down the hallway in jacobs and you can hear just about every swear word ever created but no one really seems to understand what they are saying. or that it is a sin.

      "Monkey Don't go bananas — in your former life you were a tiny monkey named Oompa. Here's what we know about you: Adorably sweet demeanor and sharp as a tack, you found success working with a street performer named Juan, who worshipped you and treated you like his own child. He bought you a gold satin jumpsuit with royal blue ruffles, a matching top hat, and a sequined bag for donations. He would play your favorite disco tunes on his accordion, prompting you to dance around and flirt with the crowd while you collected spare change and picked pockets. Everybody loved you. And you loved everybody. You and Juan took your gig around the country and raked in the riches. You were one happy little monkey."

      i cant stand people who act like they are something they arent. i dont care who you are or what you look like or what you do(or dont do) or what music you listen to or if you are a football player, writer, singer, or athlete. if you like to sing along to britney spears, sing it loud. if you have a secret love of volleyball or some other sport, play it. you dont know how much time you have left so do what you want while you still can. why do you need to act like you are really popular or really special? you can see through people like that, it's obvious. you arent any different than the rest of us. hm this stuff is nice but im not sure where it came from.

You're really growing on me (or am I growing on you) Any fool can see Sleeping in an empty bed Can't get you out of my head I won't have a life until you're dead Yes you heard what I said I wanna shake you off but you just won't go And you're all over me but I don't want anyone to know That you're attached to me, that's how you've grown Won't you leave me, leave me, leave me alone

      Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always perseveres. Love never fails. 1 Corinthians 13: 4-8

      im in a very blah mood. i dont really have any strong feelings for anything. i feel like i need to do something with my life instead of just sitting around on the computer and worrying about unimportant little events or stuff i want. i dont understand what i am supposed to do though. but i know i gotta do something. i just have this feeling that i need to do something and do it now. i think this is really interesting, maybe its God trying to tell me something. i need to think..

      i have quite a bit to say .. my mom and brother and me went to this mall in chicago because we had gift cards that could only be used there. the mall was pretty stupid though because it did not have any good stores. so i ended up getting a skirt, a pair of shorts, a magazine for spring break, a book about guitars to read on the plane, and the darkness CD. then i had to buy with my money switchfoot CD and jet CD. im listening to jet right now. its pretty good stuff. anyways i bought a watch and then a bit ago i bought amazingly cool shoes. they are red converse high tops. i already like them. oh yeah, i went to the thrift store too. that place is crazy. i got a backstreet boys tshirt, this black shirt with a fish on it and it says something about reading, a shirt about jesus and orange pants. they are pretty darn cool. i saw some red pleather pants there and i laughed. i got some pearls too. haha. i will be styling on monday. yes and my film is being developed as i type this. yay. i got the blindside CD too but i might take it back because i have gift cards at borders and i could easily buy it there but i dont know if they have it. but i heart blindside.

      at flex today, me and meghan and betsy (when she came) decided to wave at people since we sit at the top of a stairway. jacobians did not seem to like that. we got flicked off, most people thought we were waving at someone else, and the rest gave us dirty looks. a small number actually waved back or said something. most of those people we knew. it shows how nice people are, doesnt it?

      #31: Sometimes when I feel like killing someone, I do a little trick to calm myself down. I'll go over to the person's house and ring the doorbell. When the person comes to the door, I'm gone, but you know what I've left on the porch? A jack-o'-lantern with a knife in the side of its head with a note that says "You." After that, I usually feel a lot better, and no harm done.

      those black jeans have lasted me since 7th grade..amazingly they are 3's and yet they fit. red shoes are the coolest of the shoe world. red shoes are owned by many people who are amazing-- for instance, jon foreman; jon troast; miles pfefferle; betsy melchers; meghan barrett; matt bruner used to until he got his new ones. i personally have red shoes but don't consider myself amazing. also today a boy was wearing a neon green suit jacket at jacobs, the same suit jacket i almost bought at the thrift store last time i went there. i tried it on but it was large and it reflected neon-ness onto my face and made me look sick all the time.

"about miles" "he wasnt there" "well i know" "why would they say anything?" "since he's expelled and all.." "WHHHAAT???!!!" "you mean you didn't know?" "NO" "oh." not very fun. so i called betsy. and miles. we walked a little and drew parks drove by in his minivan again but he was with someone, we believe to be greg, and it scared us. im tired of talking already. everyone call me. i want to talk to people.

      so back to jacobs once again. i'm just glad theres a break in the middle of the week. for us freshman at least. english was frightening. we had to watch the animal farm movie. orchestra was different. i was lucky enough to be told from someone how the orchestra room will be burned with everyone in it. except me and the person who told me. because i talk to her. flex was boring, had to ask questions about term paper. math was stupid. spanish was sleeping because we had to do one very simple vocab worksheet the whole entire block. i was peacefully trying to sleep when i suddenly hear "the past does not exist. the future does not exist. time does not exist." and then there was a loud discussion between a few people about this. for a very long time. and i really didn't want to think deeply at that moment so i just plugged my ears so that it sounded like i was underwater. and then afterschool katy was being strange. and now i'm here.

      well i'm done now. not exactly. i don't know what the conclusion is so i didnt do that. but anyways. sunday stew is on tonight. i love bam margera. my printer is making me really angry because it doesnt work. and if it does work, it messes up. this day has been lazy and boring. at least its raining. i love the rain. nobody's really talking to me either. no one ever really talks to me online cept my good friends. i suppose those are the only people i actually want to talk to though. hm.

      at church, matt thorsen said goodbye to me and his whole family was there and i was thinking about how him and brittany used to be my best friends.. we would always go to each others houses and our moms would babysit each other's kids. it was so great. i loved it. but then suddenly it just kinda stopped. they moved closer to us and we went swimming alot there and sledding in the backyard..ha good times.. but then like i don't even know what happened but we just didn't get together anymore. it's actually quite sad how that happens. you just grow apart and that's it. i miss our good times of barbies and duke nuke-em and ice skating on the pool and concussions while sledding.

      well my taco bell wish was fulfilled except it was today for lunch. church was blah, its hard to listen. i feel bad but i usually don't understand what p.mike's saying or it is something that i don't think about like taking care of my kids. considering i don't have any. sometimes i wish that i could have timber-lee experiences about once a month but then i figured they wouldn't mean as much if they happened that often. the reason they are so great is because they happen once, maybe twice a year depending on how much we go. it makes it that much better.

      walking is now a sort of routine. we barely even walk anymore. we just sit. i'm listening to pink floyd "dark side of the moon" CD right now. its some cool stuff. i havent really posted anything today but i dunno what to say. in math this girl i don't really like said 'i have that shirt' to me and then this other boy put his hand on my shoulder and said 'don't worry, it looks much better on you' and then the girl kicked him. i said thank you. after school this hot man had no shirt on. me and betsy walked home simply because we hate the bus. it was a little difficult with my clogs but i managed. i just got back from the mall, i didn't really buy anything cept food. luckily we didnt really see anyone we knew either. we just sorta wandered in and out of stores. i posed in the bathroom and on the escalator. it was fun. and then me and betsy were bouncing along and meggie joined in and it was great fun. this CD is quite weird. a worker in pacsun thought betsy forgot her size. but we were just petting clothes. nothing to worry about. ha

      "As I recall with my stomach turning I was hiding away from myself, away from you Like nothing, though something was terribly wrong And I admit that I was only waiting for the right time Night time, the right moment for you to look away Though you never did, I pretended for a while So I could walk where I don't belong  And I remember every word you said Come back in time, come back And I remember I would soon be dead Now so pitiful, so pitiful  But I know as I hammered those nails into your beautiful hands Your eyes still try to search for mine, but I look away Now your eyes are the only thing that can save me I'm still so afraid of them piercing You're breaking into my prison Just pretended for a while My soul is dying I won't look away  And I remember every word you said...  I'll remember every word you said This time I won't look away" __blindside

      okay so last night we were on the coach bus home and i was lucky enough to have two seats to myself so i was comfortably laying and listening to switchfoot since there wasnt a movie. i stayed awake through the whole CD till twenty four and i just started to really listen to jon's voice and i fell asleep. it was  so  beautiful i cannot even tell you. earlier some other stuff happened with that too. i listened to the whole thing and then the CD stopped cuz its supposed to but then it suddenly started playing "ammunition" without me pressing buttons so i figured this meant i was supposed to listen to it. so then i did and i don't know why but during the part when jon yells the last chorus i got the good chills. like when it makes you feel like something really really good just happened. i have no idea why. but i really liked it.

      "On this day, year 2000:   Reading my journal I realized that I almost forgot this storey, it's kind of fun so I'll share it with you.   Exactly four years to this day, us and our friends in plastic pride were in the middle of a tour in Sweden. After sleeping for two hours and then driving the 13 hours to the show in Linköping, we realized that the show was not promoted at all (only 6 people turned up at the show). So we called the promoter "biffen" (Swedish for "the beef") and complained. His reply was that we were a bunch of brat kids complaining and that he were going to bring some friends and baseball bats and come down and beat us up. After talking to some people down there and realizing the the guy probably was serious we decided to leave, so we nicely packed up our gear and left.    Looking back at that, ... It really puts things in perspective. Much love to the few people that came out to the show four years ago, I'm sorry that we did not get to play.   /T "  story from a swedish man in blindside. i like it.

      today was a nice day. i slept in till about 10:30-11 but i stayed in bed and listened to the storm for awhile. betsy called and we all went and saw the day after tomorrow and it was quite good. right now i'm listening to pink floyd because my daddy is playing it loudly. tis good. after the movie i went to betsys and we i dunno sat around and watched christian lindskog and aaron marsh and a little switchfoot, relient k, bleach. kutless? actually no kutless. i don't like them. anyways, i just found out my brother is having a sleepover with his little buddies even though he went to a sleepover last night. isn't that special. so i'm listening to copeland again. it just makes me happy and sad at the same time. happy because its aaron marsh and sad because some songs are sad. i dunno what i'm talking about anymore. haha.

      i wish i could be insightful and full of crazy stories and that i could just listen to God and do what he says. just follow Him, like Brian. it would be so cool and amazing to just go on impulses to go downtown and play guitar with random people or go to mexico simply cause God said be a servant. it would be beyond amazing. hopefully my mission trip this summer will be fulfilling. we are going white water rafting thought and i am a bit scared of that. i'm sure it will be okay. it's midnight and i'm going to sleep on my crispy teepee. "sleep now sweet princess" sing it, aaron marsh..

      i really do wish i was a fire ant. and i also wish an amazing man would call me at night and simply ask "if its not too late for coffee, i'll be at your place in 10". for sure, i wouldn't mind it. not at all. actually thats another life dream, adding to my list of about 50. yay!

      miles dropped by for a bit and it was nice to see him. then i went to betsy's and we ate pizza and spiked our hair. right now i have my bangs sticking sorta up and the rest of my hair just looks strangely dirty, but tis crispy. we watched switchfoot in all of its amazingness and i watched the christian lindskog home video. i am most definently going to sweden. to see that vocal studio... those swedes! they are beyond amazing! and aaron marsh pictures were involved in tonight. and the copeland CD. i'm listening to it now. its on heavy repeat in my house.

      okay, so i can't say i'm surprised that aaron marsh has a girlfriend that he writes songs for and is completely devoted to. or at least had one.. i really hope that that girl is the best girlfriend in the world though. i'm sure she is though.

      so i woke up at 12:30, and i haven't done much of anything. i have been trying to find interviews with aaron marsh, and i found a few (including the one about starved for attention). he is one sensitive/emotional man.

      sleep new moon. i'll watch over her while the sun is up and you'll have your eyes again soon. it's a glorious day and my lonely heart is tired again and i am starved for her attention. that's when paula sparks a little light in my eye. sleep now sweet princess i'll cheer for you silently and carefully not to disturb. i'll be ready on that evening when you're starved for my attention you'll say, "wake now, prince; there's a brilliant sky above and a jealous moon in love and they are starved for our attention."

      so we got to chicago fine, and we walked to grant park but we couldn't find it so we missed the first maybe two songs. it was really great though. after it was over we waited for aaron and he talked to us and took a picture with us and said "happy same pants day" to betsy. it was amazing. he told us about how his band, copeland, and switchfoot had a sleepover because copeland's trailer broke down! i was dumbfounded that such amazingness was possible. later after we got subway, we were sitting in the grass and eating our dinner and aaron walked by and betsy and me waved at him and then he kept walking but then he turned around and came back and sat with us. he already ate fajitas though. he was really really sweet and genuine and nice. and really amazing.

      library is cool. a wrench in the copeland situation- after telling me i could go, my mom chose to go back on her word and inform me i needed to appeal to my dad because she won't be home. therefore it will be lucky if i can go now. while driving home from the library i noticed a terrible smell emitting from my brother's hair and i almost threw up. it was disgusting.

      i'm not gonna talk about how incredibly stupid my brother is right now because i simply don't want to waste my life. i'm beyond excited about copeland. the talon today was heartwarming, in a sense, most of it was useless to anyone other than the seniors but there were a few great things that brought a smile to my face. senior awards are tomorrow, and are looking like torture. already. as if jacobs isn't torture enough, let's throw everybody in the school in the gym like sardines, make kids play orchestra music, and then talk about seniors whom we really could care less about. sounds like a plan!   i was in such a good mood and suddenly i'm not. i got my permit a bit ago. now my driving is legal. i'm going to the library tonight since i'm being forced to go on a family RVing trip and none of my friends could go. so i'm going to do my plan from yesterday.   i dunno what else to talk about. i need to take pictures of everyone.

      no one is talking to me even though i'm trying to talk to them. i'm eating rainbow sherbet in a waffle cone. earlier, i ate a plant. "cool people are cool because they make their own coolness." i like my hair when it behaves how it is supposed to. my bangs are out of line and need discipline. this weekend could possibly be terrible because i have a family vacation to attend. i'll just steal away into the woods and write deep thoughts in a secret journal. then scatter them piece by piece into the lake. at night. during a storm. this keeps getting better and better...

      people liked my haircut and color. i got "your hair looks good, you are gorgeous, i love your haircut, brown looks better, your hair is marvelous" etc. all day. which was nice. its a little weird sometimes though. like when teachers compliment me..  ah im just so tired of blogging sometimes, it seems pointless and stupid and time-comsuming, but then somebody will say something nice about it and i like that. but then theres other times when people are too concerned, and they think i'm depressed, and i'm not. calm down people. i'm a pretty happy person. as of right now i could care less about this website. growl

I'm sick of being someone i'm not Please get me out of this slump I'm sick of clapping  When I know I can do it better for myself I'm sick of waiting  Sick of all these words that will never matter  I'll wire these nerves together Hoping for a chance to think on time And I'm tracing over your letter To see if your intentions are as good as mine  But you're getting worse  I swear it It's hard to prove you're an understatement You're getting worse and I know That you'll be calling me again  I'm done with everything That had to do with you Don't worry you pictures are already burned I'm done with new friends Don't sell yourself short You'll lose it in the end  I can't help how I feel

      so this morning we had a lovely groundbreaking for our church. we stood on a muddy piece of land and people dug. i got to throw a little dirt. twas fun i suppose. i rode the buses back to church and had donuts and then my mom took me out to the subdivision behind walmart and i drove around alot. then we went on boyer road and there were other cars on it and i had to stay in my lane. it was illegal. HA! then a short while ago we found small baby rabbits in the yard next door and it looks like they don't have a mother so the people next door are going to take them in tomorrow if their mother doesn't return. they are so small and hopeless. it's sad.

      what a nice night. sorta. it was fun, there was a lot of hot men involved (the talent show, blindside, and switchfoot.) OH, jon foreman's hair, that was absolutely amazing. i loved it. i loved all of them. i always do. and i liked that drew was with them. my brother was a total idiot, he thoought itwould be hilarious to film me and co. while we were sleeping and then wake us up. so i kicked him in the stomach. i don't really like my brother at all because he still thinks he's emo. and i still love my hair. i hope betsy's haircut turned out all right. my mom said she would take me out (illegally) driving. i want to drive but she hasnt taken me to get my permit yet. ah whateva

      today was nice. how come i always say "my day was..." or "today was ..." ? i annoy myself. so anyways, i wore my stepometer from mcdonalds today and the grand total of steps came to 6505. that would be 3 miles. i walked three miles at jacobs. thats a lot. people thought i was weird for wearing it but i thought it was great. ha. so skipping over the boring parts of the day, in math jay showed me something he drew and asked my opinion of what the punch line should be. it was an emo kid standing holding his heart in his hand and there was a hole in his shirt. i picked "take it and run" for the punch line. i made bubbles in my math binder. literally. in 4th block, greg was there to help with our fashion show and he borrowed my CD's and he was nice and let me and kat go on an escapade through jacobs twice. i was surprised that he was nice. during the fashion show they played my blindside CD and he knew and sang along to sleepwalking. i was amazed that he knew that because nobody knows blindside except for AH im leaving! more later! sorry

      sorry for the multitude of songs..   Staying home alone on a Friday Flat on the floor looking back On old love Or lack thereof After all the crushes are faded And all my wishful thinking was wrong I'm jaded I hate it  I'm tired of being alone So hurry up and get here So tired of being alone So hurry up and get here  Searching all my days just to find you I'm not sure who I'm looking for I'll know it When I see you Until then, I'll hide in my bedroom Staying up all night just to write A love song for no one  I'm tired of being alone So hurry up and get here So tired of being alone So hurry up and get here  I could have met you in a sandbox I could have passed you on the sidewalk Could I have missed my chance And watched you walk away?  I'm tired of being alone So hurry up and get here So tired of being alone So hurry up and get here You'll be so good You'll be so good for me

      today was nice and better than yesterday. yesterday felt like a dream, like i was watching it from somewhere else. but that was just from the medicine. i know, that sounds really bad but it's true. so today .. english was incredibly cold and boring. i can barely stay awake in that class. and its not that i don't like romeo and juliet, because i do, it's just the people who read the parts basically can't read right. they skip words or add words or just don't do it right. but anyways, 2nd block everybody in music of some kind went to the auditorium and we listened to this group of guys sing. much better than class. go rocket man. flex was nothing special, math was thoroughly uneventful. in between 3rd and 4th block tom gave me a chewed-on pick of his. i have it right now. so nice. then after school the other bus rode on ours again so i got to sit with this amazing kid with amazing pants but he put his headphones on so i couldn't talk to him. oh well.

      All around me are familiar faces Worn out places, worn out faces Bright and early for their daily races Going nowhere, going nowhere And their tears are filling up their glasses No expression, no expression Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow No tomorrow, no tomorrow And I find it kind of funny I find it kind of sad The dreams in which I'm dying Are the best I've ever had I find it hard to tell you 'Cos I find it hard to take When people run in circles It's a very, very Mad World  Children waiting for the day they feel good Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday Made to feel the way that every child should Sit and listen, sit and listen Went to school and I was very nervous No one knew me, no one knew me Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson Look right through me, look right through me

      Breathe in for luck, breathe in so deep, this air is blessed, you share with me. This night is wild, so calm and dull, these hearts they race, from self control. Your legs are smooth, as they graze mine, we're doing fine, we're doing nothing at all.  My hopes are so high, that your kiss might kill me. So won't you kill me, so I die happy. My heart is yours to fill or burst, to break or bury, or wear as jewelery, which ever you prefer.  The words are hushed lets not get busted; just lay entwined here, undiscovered. Safe in here from all the stupid questions. "hey did you get some?" Man, that is so dumb. Stay quiet, stay near, stay close they can't hear... so we can get some.  My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me. So won't you kill me, so I die happy. My heart is yours to fill or burst, to break or bury, or wear as jewelery, which ever you prefer.  Hands down this is the best day I can ever remember, I'll always remember the sound of the stereo, the dim of the soft lights, the scent of your hair that you twirled in your fingers and the time on the clock when we realized it's so late and this walk that we shared together. The streets were wet and the gate was locked so I jumped it, and I let you in. And you stood at your door with your hands on my waist and you kissed me like you meant it. And I knew that you meant it, that you meant it, that you meant it, and I knew, that you meant it, that you meant it.

      let's see..today was nice and good and will most likely get better. yes. we got a new girl today from crown and she just kinda came in and already knew people aka jeff. i dont know why she came though. i suppose i might choose jacobs over crown. maybe. anyways..after orchestra i talked to kevin a little bit. ha and that AJ was wearing a yellow rain poncho. i bought my talent show ticket at flex. i'm quite excited for that. in math jay let me listen to murder by death on his IPod. i liked it. um in spanish taylor put me in a headlock because i was playing tetris. ha i'm not injured though. so tonight is the talent show and i have to cheer for sam because he told me to. im pretty sure the whole talent show will be amazing. hopefully. and we are also hopefully going to eat dinner together.

      so i didn't post yesterday and i thought of a lot of stuff to say earlier but i forgot most of it. but yesterday.. um..i don't really remember much of what i did. well i got a ride home with betsy and we went to her house and then i went to impact and it was great. mostly cause of the amazing man. whose name i do not know. but he has amazing longish blonde hair and amazing pantalones and he was posing and smiling in our direction. so very amazingly. but then he bolted after the service and we didn't get to talk to him. then i was up late because of stupid dickens. today was decent. actually my mind just melted so i don't remember what happened today except for drummers times 2, one grabbing my hand, i remember playing a lot of tetris on my calculator, got attacked by "biggs" in spanish because he hates me. he told me he does. and he hates switchfoot. eh i don't exactly care about him though. he's just a mean kid. ah i don't know what else

      umm i don't like this new blogger. it's confusing and strange. and slower. grr. i'm gonna post longer posts and fewer because i don't like this. today was actually good. for once. i went on an escapade after 2nd block that went all around the junior hallway and twas fun. i brought a picture of nice swedish men, not christian lindskog, but other ones. miss america was lame and stupid and pointless and useless to me. i suppose other people might have liked it. whatever. after school was a  beautiful  rain and so me natalie and betsy decided to walk home in it. it was great. very nice. Oh, yesterday.. went to church, then my great aunt's house.. very uncomfortable. my source of entertainment for about 4-5 hours was charles dickens. great expectations. it was terrible. soo after that we went home and i didnt really do anything great. except sleep. i just looove to sleep.

      my internet has been broken since i dont know last thursday i believe and it still doesn't work properly. i was lucky enough to get this webpage to load correctly after about 30 minutes. and i'm serious. this last weekend was nice, meghan's ballet recital was great. we slept over at her house and had an interesting discussion for i don't know 3 hours? more or less, it was interesting. school is so close to being over, i can't stand it anymore. not that i could stand it before. on sunday i saw harry potter. its a very good movie. today i had mosquito bites that itched alot. i got calamine lotion from the nurse and people thought i was strange with huge white marks on my legs. in gym we had "recess" all block. it was pointless. on wednesday we are doing yoga outside. i love gym most of the time. its too easy. i'm trying to think of anything i could possibly say because this webpage is not going to load again and i won't be able to post for awhile and umm i don't know what to say. i'm listening to tsunami bomb. i need to burn a CD for miqui and she said she was gonna burn me thrice but i don't know if she will remember. i have driver's ed tonight and its almost over. i wish it was over now though because now that school's out it will be interfering with fun stuff. like a movie romance concerts. swedish festival is on sunday and despite popular belief& diminished concert is saturday! and saturday is my church's car wash so if your car is dirty and you want me to wash it, bring it to my church on saturday from 9-12. yes, in the morning. i don't want to wake up that early. the mission trip is going to be great because we get to help homeless people and children and old people, while being in pennsylvania! on the other hand, my texas vacation is soon approaching and looks to be bad. it interferes with basically everything. like sandblast. i suppose there is always next year. i guess thats it since my mind is blank. as usual! adios for who knows how long.

      She changes your mind when you see the joy in her eyes. It makes you feel. She draws your eyes from all the things that have made you numb and makes you feel. If I could open up my heart and let her out I would never have to sing her name aloud.  It was your "hello" that kept me hanging on every word and your "good-bye" that keeps me listening for your voice around each corner.  I'll sing songs to help me stay up all night. I don't want to go to sleep. I'll sing songs and hope you're listening carefully and know exactly what I mean. It's the song you must seek out when your night has just begun. In the distance you can find the lips from which was sung a melody.

      urban hiking is superb. we went to meijer gas station and i bought candy and a bottle of soda. it was quite fun. my mom took in my pictures from the digital camera and got the printed out for me and put on a CD so now i have amazingness right in my house! i can zoom in a lot and everything. its beautiful. aside from that, i have driver's ed tonight and it's bound to be boring. its not terrible but it isn't my favorite thing to do. but i am glad that i can get my license in 9 months. well a little more because my birthday is the 21st. and i'm already counting down til spring break because that trip will be so much fun. yay. aaron marsh is amazing

      my mom was telling me about all of the amazing cars she saw in california on her vacation without me and i told her i would buy them. so she said she would fly out there with me like next summer and we would buy a car and drive it back here. i kept asking her if she was serious and she said she would so i'm holding her to it. i will get an amazing car like my mom said she saw at least 5 VW buses and like all these old cars that i don't really know but sound good to me. she said she doesn't know what a relient K is though.    aside from this, i found a blindside song entirely in swedish and i would like to hear it but i don't own that CD. its on an older one. so sad.

      okay so in my boredom during a driver's ed movie, i thought about our summer after senior year 3 month long vacation. first, we will go to mexico. then i think we should do the road trip to georgia in my RV because it is do-able because i've already done it. then cornerstone will take place. after cornerstone we should do the cross-country train trip to california (san diego) and once we have returned home, immediately leave for sweden. but if we want to go to the midsummer festival, we would have to go to sweden before georgia and move everything around. i also realized that this probably won't happen because of lack of funds. aka MONEY. unless we start saving now.

        post numero 950! wheee!       &nbsp;   i'm extremely excited for this&nbsp; trailer weekend. although i won't be attached to the internet for four days, i don't believe this to be a bad thing because lately&nbsp;i have been on ever so much. which means too much. so now i can take a break outdoors with the black squirrels and badminton and scoopers and wheelhouse and hikes with angelic findings and thrifting and swimming and boating and scrabble and blackjack and JELLY RATS! i'm bringing them. be prepared, sweden is amazing. it's 1:00 so that means i should get packing soon. i downloaded sleeping at last, mewithoutyou, anberlin, and emery last night and they are all very good. i think later i will download cool hand luke and anothello (if that's how it's spelled..) but that doesn't matter now. so i must be going before my time runs out. excitement!!!        &nbsp;   farewell, until we meet again

         i'm so bored.    there is a new kind of mountain dew that you can get at taco bell, and i had it today but it really wasn't that good. sadly.     i love this numbering feature.     my chemical romance is a very nice band.     i don't want people to think i don't like them when i don't even know them. i hope&nbsp;i don't come across as a mean person or something..    purple rain is a strange movie.    i am gleeful.     i chung you: would you cry? Rocker1821: if i died?&nbsp; i chung you: yeah&nbsp; i chung you: ?Rocker1821: no i wouldnt cry&nbsp; i chung you: why not?&nbsp; Rocker1821: cuz i would be in heaven.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    okay tomorrow we are going to go to the thrift store because i need to. so yeah. be ready.    ew my straightening balm is drying crispy and needs to be fixed!!   i like the new copeland song.   i want to write my own songs for guitar and i'm trying it's just not working out easily.   if we don't go to the thrift store tomorrow, i'm going to start my schooltime renovations on my clothing. meaning i'm going to take everything out, sort through whether or not i want it, and then organize it back in the drawers. which also means it's going to become a disaster area. yay!   then after the aforementioned happens, i can make a list of amazing clothing i want for school.  i believe aforementioned is one of the coolest words i've ever used properly.   hopefully that's a word.    &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       i am really bored but it's summer so that makes it okay. that's my theory. i downloaded 2 blame twilight songs today and they are both superb. there is a possibility of thrift store-ness today because my mother said we could depart after the furniture was delivered, tis being delivered as i type these very words, so maybe.. oh i hope so. my pancreas need it lol. pancreas are weird and i don't know where they are or what they do. i do know that if they don't work right, you have diabetes. so it has something to do with insulin and blood sugar. hmm. i'm listening to dashboard. i want their other CDs. one day i will go on a CD buying spree. just save up millions of dollars and then go to best buy and buy every single CD i want. that would be spectacular.

       they need better fonts to pick from. i actually woke up, got out of bed, dressed, put on makeup, and was ready to leave by 10 am, but alas! my mother decided to not go to Ikea in the morning, no, she went to church to work. and so i took a nap. haha it was well deserved. i was quite upset at my mother though. so after dropping off many people in many different places, i took the wheel and drove us with few problems to ikea. this being my first time on I90, i was shaking in my boots. people don't use their blinker. at ikea they didn't have the bookshelves or window seat that i wanted but i will get&nbsp;it eventually. i am excited to get a window seat because then i can sit there and play guitar or write stuff or who knows what all. but it will be cool. after we payed for our stuff, i spotted a SWEDISH FOOD MARKET!!! needless to say, i bought food from there. there was a pleasent sign saying "take home a little bit of Sweden...or give it as a gift!" i decided the only better sign i could think would be the same sign with a man on it. a swedish man named christian lindskog. but anyways, i'm saving the swedish food for the trailer because the trailer is amazing. we are going to have a badminton tourney and i'm going to win. ha! i'm not too good actually. but i do have fun.

       so operation: qp is moving right along and is coming along nicely.  good good. we had a vacation bible school meeting tonight and it was a snoozefest but that's okay. i'm sure it will be fun. okay um i believe i am allergic to bananas and need to stop eating them. anyways, i drove everybody home, literally. and i had no accidents, problems, or scares. it was superb. then a bit ago i was playing guitar. and now i'm drinking a fruit smoooooooothie with banana in it and i feel allergic to it. so maybe i shouldn't. hmm..what to do.. tomorrow i might go to IKEA, the greatest swedish store ever, unless there is a swedish store where you can buy swedish men. i'm not sure about that though. anyways, i watched a small bit of the democratic convention but then my mom turned it off. currently i'm wearing my jacobs gym shorts because my laundry is being done. it makes me feel ill. so i suppose that is all for now. umm yeah.

        sometimes i have feelings that i don't like and i want to rip them out.       &nbsp;   other times i have feelings that i absolutely love and i want them to last forever and they can't.        &nbsp;   i want more of the good and less of the bad and yet i know it's unlikely because life just can't be like that.&nbsp;       i can live with that fact, so long as i get the good feelings once in awhile.

       camping out is joyful and fun. especially when operation: quirky petropolis is created. but backing up a bit, we went to the fireworks and saw many an amazing man but none that we actually knew enough to talk to. but it was alright anyways because it was cool to see people, minus andy t. i am still scared of him after two years, i still greatly dislike him after two years, i don't want to see him again. i also don't think it appears cool to stalk people. after the fireworks extravaganza we headed to katy's and had fun. we watched footage and made footage of important historical events. everything has been planned. it's all going into effect. Yay. betsy's birthday is also soon approaching and i have to get a super cool present. aside from that, i have to go to a children's bible camp meeting tonight because i'm going to be a happy teacher for the younguns. camping is so cool! i want to camp every day. except i don't like waking up sweaty. that's a bit gross. i also didn't enjoy being locked out of the house and then having to guard the tent. but i suppose that was better than running around the house in socks.&nbsp; it was fun. i want to go to ikea. those swedes have made it all.     &nbsp;  i chung you: i hope aaron marsh comes to your birthday fiesta!    i chung you: haha   IrishDancin83: yeah! well it could be likely because they'll be in town for the concert   i chung you: yeah actually    i chung you: ha i would cry   i chung you: i'm not even kidding   IrishDancin83: hahaha me too   i chung you: he would ring the doorbell and i would melt    i chung you: and then hug him   ---   IrishDancin83: ahhhhhhhhjjjjjhhhhhhhhh   IrishDancin83: i know!!!!!

       ooh so good times. last night i went to meggie's and the power was out for awhile but then it came back after we sat outside around yet another bonfire. i love fire, in a non-arsonist/pyro way. it was all good. we played fun games like pig mania, haha, monopoly started at 1:30 a.m. we ended up watching edward scissorhands at 4 am and then i didn't fall asleep until 5:30. it wasn't too good but i couldn't fall asleep. i had&nbsp;a beautiful dream last night. i was driving a limo and i was going through the toll booth and i pulled through it and this huge truck plowed right into my car and i got thrown through the window and died, but i was still on earth. everyone was screaming and these two people were crying over their friend's body. but then i went over and wrote in blood above her "my life 4 yours" and then she came back to life. it was so incredible, i was overcome with emotion in my dream and in real life. it may be the coolest dream i have ever had in my life.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;  so then in the morning we watched lance armstrong win the tour de france. and ate pancakes. then we set vladimir the moth free in the park. then i climbed up on these rubbery monkey bars and laid on them in the sunshine and it was great and i almost fell asleep. it was beautiful. then we swung by my house and i got money and picked up betsy and went to target and kohl's and walked to burger king and ate food. it was pleasant. and now i'm home and really tired. and we are going to the fireworks tonight. so much fun stuff. wheeeee!

       when paula sparks;  Copeland     Sleep now moon.     I'll watch over her while the sun is up     and you'll have your eyes again soon.     It's a glorious day and my lonely heart is tired again     and I am starved for her attention.     That's when Paula sparks a little light in my eye.     Sleep now sweet princess I'll cheer for you silently and carefully not to disturb.     I'll be ready on that evening     when you're starved for my attention you'll say,     "wake now, prince; there's a brilliant sky aboveand a jealous moon in love and they are starved for our attention."

      hmm...how to describe the fun that happened yesterday.. it was amazing. it was really cool to meet all those people and see that they were nice and friendly. it was neat. the concert was okay, kind of, there were a lot of nice looking men there with really good pants. i am really tired today though. and covered in mosquito bites. no big deal though. it was all good. lots of fun. aw a kid from my work group from the mission trip just IMed me. how neat. this morning i had to wake up and go in the algonquin founders days parade and it was entirely too early for me, even if it was only 8am. thats too early. far too early. i need to go back to sleep. but its already 3 so i can't. well i guess that's it. happy birthday again miles.

       it's always interesting to go back to the beginnings&nbsp;of this webpage and just read how i was. i was weird. i was dumb a lot. it's really interesting to see how much i have changed as a person since the beginning of this year to now. i used to like rap music, "cute" clothes, i cared what people thought about me. but then i just slowly changed into what i am now, which is unknown to me. i don't really know what i would call myself. i'm not really any one thing. and i kinda like it that way.

        i found a very nice article/review/story about copeland:     "Music can really be like a drug sometimes … and I’m addicted. If I don’t get my concert “fix” every month or so, I start to get a little antsy. After a show I’m normally exhilarated, all is right with the world, and I REALLY want some Taco Bell. I’m on a concert high. It’s got the same drawbacks too: when you start to really get into it, you begin building up a tolerance. You have to get more and more of the really good stuff to get the same effect as the lightweight stuff that got you high when you first started. It’s difficult to find a band these days that will really inspire me, make me believe in everything that is right with music and the human race, and win my complete respect and adoration. It’s just not as easy to impress me as it was before I became such a desperate junkie. I need something of real substance, of emotion, intelligence, staying power, relevance and truth. Enter Copeland to satisfy my craving.       &nbsp;   Copeland is one of those bands whose sound sweeps over you like waves until you’re drowning in sonic bliss, or maybe more appropriately encompasses you like the smoke that is billowing around the room, seeping slowly into your hair, your clothing, your lungs, your inner being. By the end of each of the two shows I felt like I had made a deep spiritual connection with this band. Maybe it’s Marsh’s sweet, soothing and full-ranged vocals; maybe it’s the soaring guitar melodies embedded within the songs; or maybe it’s the fact that God’s presence is so clearly woven into the fabric of the music no matter what they may be singing about. Whatever it is, I knew that I had found something real those two nights, and, like a true addict, all I came away wanting was more of it."       &nbsp;   isn't it the truth.

        i had a very very good dinner, one of the best in a very long time. it was superb. i like making lists because they make me feel much more organized. i, once again, am already despising this up-and=coming RV trip because it is taking away 3 very good concerts from me. scratch that, 3 Amazing concerts from me. it is so unfair that i am always missing out on the good stuff because i have to go somewhere dumb and be very close to my family all the time. and it's not like i hate my family, i just don't like having to be in an enclosed space with them 24/7. maybe  this place we are going to will have a lake or good trees or somewhere i can run off to when i want to.         &nbsp;   Schedule of Tomorrow      Try to roll out of bed by 10:31    Shower, get dressed, make-up, etc..    Eat something    Leave at 12:15     Back at whenever we call my mom, before 5&nbsp;    Gather up stuff for birthday party     Leave again     wow. that is going to be one great day.

       umm..today i did nothing, again, except for paint a surfboard. i played guitar for a bit. it's really close to storming violently but it hasn't started quite yet. i just heated up some pizza snacks. they are yummy. the surfboard is neato. its for the founders days parade, which i'm going to be in with my church. so be on the lookout for me i suppose. actually don't because i will probably look weird. haha oh well. yay it started raining. hopefully it will cool down but probably stay humid. you can barely breathe, the air is like a thick blanket or something. i hate it. i'm listening to my chemical romance right now. i've been listening to music a lot lately. well i'm going to do something. not sure what. something though.

        i burned a ton of tastebuds off my tongue and it is terrible. i got juan carlos III back from betsy. thank goodness! i have two blisters on my heel and they hurt a lot. i don't like blisters. it was really hot and sweaty today. i didn't like it much. i also decided i do not like sleeping bags because they are too confining and then you wake up all twisted&nbsp;and your clothes aren't on correctly, like this morning my shorts were twisted all around. it was obnoxious. i guess there's nothing really to fix that except not sleep in a sleeping bag. hmm whatever. i'm excited for all of the events on friday (concert and miles's birthday). i played a lot of guitar again today and my fingers still hurt. i am attempting to learn "california" by copeland. i got some of it. i'm still getting "on fire" by switchfoot as close to perfect as i can. i want a cell phone because it is so annoying and hard to just have one phone for my whole family. i rarely get to use it because someone else has to make "important calls" and then that means i have to wait for at least an hour, which by then i don't even remember why i was calling someone in the first place. i have good arguments for why i need a cell phone and why we should join lifetime but that doesn't seem to make one bit of difference to my parents. okay so i need more things to do with my time because i sit around doing nothing or i'm online. usually both. my mom said that i can start horseback riding again soon because i had to switch barns. i love horseback riding. i miss it though. well i can't think of anything better to say for now. i need more interesting thoughts.

      i was at betsy's last night for a fun night of switchfoot. it was splendid. i've been having good dreams lately and i've been pondering dreams and why we have them. why did God decide to give us something to do while we are sleeping? what is the importance of dreams? is there ever any truth to a dream? do they ever come true? why do certain things happen in dreams, even if you don't like it? why is your sub-conscious so strange and different from what you really think? why can't there be any control of dreams? why can't we remember all of them? how come some dreams seem like they happened? i can't even answer any of these questions completely but i like to think about it. i want to leave my house today but i don't think i will. i will probably take a nap and play guitar and lie around and eat food and eventually go to bed. probably shower sometime. not too sure.

        i went to the mall today and got my homecoming dress. it is actually being ordered because it had a stain so they had to get another but that doesn't matter. i saw a lot of people there: meggie (and family), greg mackiewicz, matt bruner and T, and a guy who looked like miles. my new hobby is shuffling cards. i can do a bridge now. my mom and I are trying to figure out where the elgin thrift store is. i might be able to have people over tonight. i don't know for sure yet. i need to use the phone but my mom is on it and has been for about an hour. i drove to and from the mall. it was sweet. i didn't hit anything or have any near death experiences like I did a few weeks ago. that was a terrible day. I had two near death experiences in one day. scary stuff. i'm making a list of CD's I want because there are so many. it's just something to occupy my time. i want to talk to people, i'm feeling lonely even though i hung out with people yesterday. i think it's great that paul (youth pastor of impact) is on VH1 for mentos! that is incredibly funny. i played guitar a lot today and my fingers are hurting. it feels good. i'm kinda excited for homecoming. it's like I want to shop and plan and whatnot but then i'm afraid its going to be bad because last year they only played rap music. so hopefully this year it will at least be a mix. i don't know though. oh well i guess if it's rap music i will just go along with it. hm i'm going to try and use the phone now.

      mall fun. i found my homecoming dress already. now i just have to convince my parents to buy it. it is gorgeous though, it's purple and silky and slinky and ruched at the top and flowy and gorrrrrrgeous. i love it so much. i really really want it. homecoming is far too early this year. september 18?! who decided that?!? that is two weeks after school starts. growl. i got a very nice comment about being poetic but turns out it was a song not my own thoughts.&nbsp; man i have to go&nbsp;but i'll be on later and post post post. lots of posting. &nbsp;

      la ti da. yesterday i got fake converse shoes, low tops, and they are black. they were 8 bucks so hey why not. i got one roll of film developed and i'm getting the other one any moment now. whenever my parents decide to get in the car and drive or let me drive. eh. i went to starbucks and then the movies last night. we saw a cinderella story. it was kinda lame. it was okay at best. its unrealistic. i can't make myself not think about the&nbsp;reality of the world so then i just don't like it anymore. it's sad. umm then later today we are going to the mall and it is bound to be fun since we will all be together again since um i think school got out? that is horrendous. good gracious. i also found out that i will be missing a bleach concert, copeland concert, and blindside/mewithoutyou concert within one week because i have to go on&nbsp; yet another RV trip. i am so upset. i cannot believe that i am once again missing great things because of a stupid family vacation that i won't even like. i don't understand my parents and why they can't try and at least be sympathetic that i can't go! they just said well we can't change the vacation. maybe next time. THERE IS NO NEXT TIME. who knows when any of those bands will be back? bleach will never come back because this is their farewell tour!! does this not make sense to them?! arrrrgh i'm going to i dunno sit around angry and then do something else.

        Post Number 905-    ha fun. i really want to see everyone today, or tomorrow because i don't know what everyone is up to. APPARENTLY my brother talked to kevin williams online last night and now a movie romance is gonna play at his little concert at jordan's. this is strange and i am greatly confused and surprised by this occurance. so now i will be attending and it will prove to be interesting. i finished michael moore's book last night and it was superb. it was interesting and well written. i wish i could vote. and also, if bush gets re-elected i may be moving to sweden. i decided that a bit ago but my parents won't let me. i saw a gorgeous hippie bus yesterday and i pet it and kissed it (not directly). it had a stove in it. it was tan. then today i saw yet another hippie bus and today this one was a spectacular bright blue but it wasn't the camper type. neither were for sale. i desperately want one. they are seriously one of the coolest cars on this planet. i think just about any car from the 60's and 70's are amazing. although i have seen some ugly ones. but anyways, enough about cars i will never get. i am going to talk my mother into taking in my pictures because i would enjoy looking at them. i love taking pictures because they are such great and easy ways to show your life to others. i think it is really neat that someone invented them. i wish i could be so smart as to invent something as great as pictures. i'm just so happy that i can blog again!! i missed it so! i got&nbsp;2 cool shirts on the mission trip, one says "youthworks be like jesus 04" on the front and then on the back i got people to sign it. the other one is orange and says "possible" on the front and on the back says something along the lines of "for nothing is impossible for those who believe"-jesus.&nbsp; but i can't remember exactly what it says. oh well. we had devotionals every morning outside and after i finished the questions i decided to read luke. i'm not sure why but i felt like it. so i read it every day and i'm a little more than halfway finished. my goal is to read the whole bible by the end of high school so hopefully i can do that. it's a tough goal but i really want to. so i'm going to attempt to. i don't think i will read it in order though. i dunno it just depends.&nbsp;my new favorite verse- 1 Corinthians 15:10 "But by the grace of God, I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect." there's another one i like- luke 1:37. it is simply "for nothing is impossible with God". i adore psalms and proverbs because they are pretty and poetic. so moving on, i am going to try and post more thoughts of mine. since mostly i just say "well i went here and there adn talked to so-and-so." i thnk that is boring and you probably don't care anyway. so in conclusion, i enjoy blogging and will be blogging more often.

        hey i've gotten blogger to work because i am on my laptop. my normal computer is broken and not here.  this blogger is different and cool. its easier. the mission trip was just so cool and great. it was a really good experience. my work group painted a guy's house. he was a weird man but that isn't what matters. we would go to the&nbsp; YMCA after and shower. i was usually covered in paint. there were some pretty cool people at the camp. there were people from connecticut, michigan, new york, wisconsin, and then us. it was all very cool. i don't really know where to start and what to put on here. there is just a lot that happened.  one day we went to a gospel church service and i was sitting by one of the counselors, krista.&nbsp;at one part i just turned and hugged her and then we prayed and it was really nice. on the last club night we got our feet washed by our chaperones. a lot of people were crying and it was really emotional. i just kept hugging people. i liked it all. on the last day we went to a senior citizen center because we finished our house and the old people told me i would be a good waitress. it was cute. umm i will think some more and post again.

      i'm in pennsylvania on a laptop, but it works better than my house computer so anyways. texas was okay, i dyed part of my hair black, i wish i went to sandblast, i wish i went to cornerstone, i want this trip to be cool. i listened to really superb music today from the 80's. it was grand. we drove for about 12 hours today. i had to curl up in a ball, i felt like a rock. it was painful. i'm going to concentrate on being social now. adios.

        i can breathe a sigh of relief..     VBS is over and done with. i cannot express my thankfulness for that. i can sleep in, stay up late, do what I want to during the day, be unfriendly, yell!, and just be absolutely weird. it is wonderful. except for the funeral tomorrow for the unknown great uncle, packing, and then leaving on sunday for missouri. ugh. i can't believe that i have to live in that RV for another week. like 16 days wasn't already enough, i get to run off to yet another hickville and spend quality time in a lake. with myself because i can't tolerate my brother and then my dad will be off with his buddy who lives where we are going and then my mom has her own things she wants to do like read books. so i decided i'm bringing my guitar and laptop. that should be sufficient entertainment for the weekend. and who knows, they might have some kind of internet connection. then you wouldn't even have to miss me.       i'm sad to see some of those kids go, like 2 out of 13. the rest, well, let's just say there were no tears shed. i have to find an all black outfit for tomorrow. i don't have many black skirts but i think i have pants. wearing all black is pretty boring if you ask me, i like neon colors and crazy tights and all kinds of colors of pants. now i'm up to red orange and gray. i need more though. any neon color would be nice. well i will just have to keep searching. i want to see napoleon dynamite badly but i don't have any way to see it because i would have to go to barrington, plus i have to pack/clean and i have no way there or back. let alone someone to go with.

        well i had Betsy C. M. come over to my (Meghan M. K.) house. we got out every possibility of a homecoming dress for our junior year 80's theme. and body suits. my brother was in the basement so we couldn't just be changing in the general family room so we got out an assortment of spandex body suits and wore them. let me just say, spandex body suits may be the most uncomfortable piece of clothing i have ever worn. anyways, some of the dresses were superb and some weren't. i found stirrup baseball socks that are a nice shade of green. i put on the whole baseball outfit and BCM took a picture and then I (MMK) took a picture of BCM in the yellow beautiful poufy dress. then we did a body suit shot and that was all the pictures we needed. i am enjoying using the initials. BCM MMK MEB KEG. more fun that way. cept i don't know some people's middle name(s). i sort of have many middle names that i can't even spell but they aren't on my birth certificate. here's my attempt- meghan margaret mugilicudy thostesen elizabeth keyes. hmm bad spelling, i am sure of it. they are my mom's maiden name, my grandma's maiden name, elizabeth is my great grandma i think and then margaret was a different great grandma. i was supposed to be a boy. hmph. i am not. my lacey glove is ripping a lot. tomorrow i'm wearing my orange fishnets. to celebrate my not having to wake up anymore. apparently we aren't leaving for missouri until sunday because saturday we have a funeral to attend. of someone i don't really know. a great uncle. i'm not a fan of funerals in general. ha i don't think anyone is a fan of funerals. that was such a stupid thing to say. well uh no one's on and i need to shower, blow dry hair, etc. so i'm off to restock the ketchup.. just kidding.

      ookay today was nice and good. well just recently it was nice and good. VBS was smelly, tiring, funny, etc. I'm just tired of trying to make kids listen and behave. i also need to figure out a way for them to stop touching me..i do not like being touched by them. i'm not exactly a touchy-feely person to begin with, but then they are dirty and i don't like some of them. plus they   smell. really bad.   so i was wearing neato socks also. i love socks when they are cool but i actually hate them because my feet get disgusting, as if feet aren't gross enough without being sweaty. ew i'm grossing myself out with this talk of feet. so after VBS we went to burger king (betsy meggie hannah and myself) and brian plushkis was working so we talked to him. it was exciting. i hadn't seen him in ages. i'm not sure he even knows me. oh well. he might go to betsy's birthday and that is really good. thats gonna be one good party. i'm so tired right now i'm almost asleep on the keyboard. it is 1:42 in the afternoon. i am the lamest of the lame.

      VBS was still scary, i believe that our group is the wildest, and craziest. one boy, brandon, said that we were weirdos today. yesterday we kidnapped betsy and took her to coldstone and then we took a picture with the funny workers and then walked to taco bell and i drank a soda and natalie and betsy ate some food and then we went to betsy's and listened to music and i ate sushi for the first time and betsy ate really strange squid and betsy opened her presents and we ate cake and made the first two personalized invitations to her birthday. man, they are amazing. quast may be the best word e'er spoken in the english language. anywho..today we went to the thrift store in elgin and i was pleasantly amazed. it is the best one i've been to. i got a green grandma skirt, a grandma sweater, a black and white houndstooth skirt, a bright orange sweater, a green polo that smells, a flowered suitcase, gray pants, red pants, ahh i can't think of what else. i'm really tired already and it is 6:50. what the heck. little kids are tiring and mostly smelly. i really do love the four boys. jacob and chris were fighting over who got to sit in my lap and hold my hand. it was sweet. i like singing songs and freestyle grooving. i'm not a big fan of synchronized interpretive movements, unless it is at homecoming. speaking of homecoming, junior year homecoming i am getting an 80's dress. i am already excited for that. i have been thinking about how great something like VBS is for a little kid. getting to know Jesus and Christianity when you are an impressionable youth is a good good thing. i'm glad i had it.

      VBS is tiresome and fun. i kind of like getting up early because then i end up doing more in my day. plus i don't feel like a lazy bum all the time. i kind of smell from the children. i like most of them, there's just 1 or 2 i'm not very fond of. little jacob came up to me and hugged me for about 3 minutes. it was adorable. i had taco bell for lunch, hurray. also yummy. a new word was discovered today- qwast. it has no real meaning. also, the word howa is real. it has a meaning similar to whoa. aside from all this, i have a funny sticker on my hand.

       i went to guitar center for my brother's birthday present. i got strings and picks. nothing too exciting. there are always nice looking rockers in guitar center. a dreadlocked man helped me figure out which strings and picks i needed. we went out to dinner after. for my brother's birthday. we went to mandile's. it was nice, i suppose. i usually present ideas/plans when we go out to dinner. i don't know what else to say. the trailer weekend kinda made me realize i am a fearful person and i wish i was braver. more daring. it's not always a bad thing, though, to be scared because then you tend to do less stupid things. i like my pictures i drew. i wish i had a scanner to put them on display on here. alas i do not. oh well. blindside concert apparently on sept. 1 w/ mewithoutyou. getting more details.

        sorry for the multitude of quotes/posts but i really like this one.           Graham: People break down into two groups when they experience something lucky. Group number one sees it as more than luck, more than coincidence. They see it as a sign, evidence, that there is someone up there, watching out for them. Group number two sees it as just pure luck. Just a happy turn of chance. I'm sure the people in Group number two are looking at those fourteen lights in a very suspicious way. For them, the situation isn't fifty-fifty. Could be bad, could be good. But deep down, they feel that whatever happens, they're on their own. And that fills them with fear. Yeah, there are those people. But there's a whole lot of people in the Group number one. When they see those fourteen lights, they're looking at a miracle. And deep down, they feel that whatever's going to happen, there will be someone there to help them. And that fills them with hope. See what you have to ask yourself is what kind of person are you? Are you the kind that sees signs, sees miracles? Or do you believe that people just get lucky? Or, look at the question this way: Is it possible that there are no coincidences?

        well... i'm pushing buttons on here and i don't know what they do. so..bear with me. VBS is good/scary. there are four boys whom i love- jacob christopher connor and brandon. most of the girls are sweet but there's a few ..interesting ones. oh well it's nice to see the little ones loving God. umm i'm really tired from all this though. i don't like waking up. it's far too early. we are supposed to go to guitar center today for my brother and i want to buy a guitar but i wouldn't mind putting the money towards a beautiful car. ha like mine would even be beautiful. but anyways, i don't really know what i'm going to do except for napping. i am going to wear one of my new thrift store shirts tomorrow to VBS. well......

       well.. my parents were kind of dumb today and then it was made my fault, according to them. so then i stopped talking. i just don't respond to them after i'm mad. i should really be sleeping now because i have to get up so so early and it is unethical and yet good because it looks promising and fun. but anyways, betsy told me to come over and hang out with her and miles and co. so then my dad said he was going to bed in five minutes and wouldn't drive me and then my mom said she could take me but i would have to get a ride home but my dad was going to sleep so then i just sat on a chair for awhile and then my mom came down asked why we hadn't left yet and i wasn't happy and said "because you guys told me you were leaving/sleeping and you both did neither of those things." but then she yelled at me because "it isn't my fault that I have to do things and I offered to drive you there" and i don't know what else because i stopped listening. so then i came down here and here i am. typing away. and really tired. and also in desperate need of a shower. ugh.

       twas a weekend reminiscent of no other:    hippie buses, space age vans, movie marathons, midnight (well, almost midnight) swims, man hugs, cheese cubes, large yellow and black spiders, large beetles, bug attacks, signs, dews, boating, tom thumb mini golf, close range putting, massive cotton candy, our friends, scoopers, badminton, hippie rockers, thrift store, magazines, hairstyles, over eating, lack of sleep, not going to church (oops), deep conversations on the dock late into the night, aaron marsh, station wagons, good looking workers at k-mart, smelly-ness, cool float, toe injuries, cute sunburns, cool windswept air dried hair, boy pants, fashions for school, homecoming plans, absolute and total weirdness.
