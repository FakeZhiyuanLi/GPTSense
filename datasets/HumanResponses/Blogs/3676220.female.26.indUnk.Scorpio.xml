      I just found one of the ugliest apartments I've ever seen.  It's about the complete opposite type of place I want to live.  It has dark blue carpet, this weird wall in the living room with fake wood panelling and tiled mirrors, horribly ugly wallpaper in the dining area, along with another mirrored wall patch, and it's kind of dark inside.  But for some reason, I kind of like it!  It's also $425!  The bar part of the kitchen is made of long bricks and the whole place seems like a ski lodge or something inside.  The front window is huge and there's lots of plants outside the window.  The front yard has a filled in pool.  All the appliances are nice & clean and so is the bathroom and there's a ton of storage space in the bedroom.  Hmmmmm.  Definitely cannot argue with that price, too.  And the landlord is flexible on the deposit.  I'm going to look at a shitload of places this week, too, just so I'm not being stupid about it.  And scrutinize my budget again.  I can afford alot more, but no sense in flushing money down the toilet.  I'd rather put it towards other things I need or a new computer or whatever instead of rent...

      Just finished with band practice.  We just about finished my song.  Ryan wrote the lyrics to it so it's called 'Everybody Gets Low', which I like.  I went into it thinking Burning Airlines, edgy guitars, high-hat-heavy drums, sparse, booming bass, etc., but the 2nd chorus/bridge that Ryan put to it has a different kind of sound.  Ramzi added some 'flair' to it as well.  It's got a lot of parts, so it's pretty interesting.  I'll be super excited to play it.  I looove writing new songs.  Especially since we've been playing the same ones forever.  I also wrote a new song earlier this week and started another one right before practice today.  The first one is called 'I Really Shouldn't But I Want to So Bad' and one of the guitar melodies is really reminiscent of something pretty dear to me.  And the other song is called 'Resurface'.  I have a recurring theme.  Don't think I'll expound upon that, though.    Anyway, I'm really productive when I actually sit down to do stuff.  The hard part for me has always been getting started.  I quit Hands Up on Monday.  It's really awesome to have free time and also that I will not be too tired to go to non-Hands Up shows.  I've missed alot of my friends bands playing because I didn't want to be at a smokey bar 5 or 6 nights a week.  It'll also be nice just to hang out with good or new friends I barely got to see since I haven't had much free time.    Also started my website this week, which I've been putting off forever.  Bought my ticket to the Austin City Limits music festival!  I'm really excited, it's pretty far off, though...September.  SLOAN, SPOON, Broken Social Scene, Medeski, Martin & Wood, Pixies, American Analog Set, and a bunch of others.    Sent about 30 nerdsropes to Ste in England.  Daniel is also just getting back to England from his American recording, tour, etc.  I'm really sad he didn't get to come here and that I couldn't go up to New York and hang out with him.    Been really bad about reading all the books I have piled up.  Did get the new HOW and STEP magazines today, though.  Very cool, lots of good ideas.

      Still deciding how exactly I'm going to use this thing.  And whether or not I want to tie it to mountain2sound.com, whenever I ask permission from Spoon and actually get that domain.  I've been really grumpy all day.  And I know I'm being irrational.  But I want to keep being irrational.  Because I want to, dammit.  About to head over to Johnny Killed Rock N Roll Studios to check out the mixing of our Jawbox song for the tribute album.  Okay, time to blow this popsicle stand.

      I used to think when I had thousands of dollars in the bank that I 'had no money'.  What was I thinking???  Well, now I'm really damn broke after moving.  I was obviously not thinking clearly when I made that last post.  Anyway, I stopped going out to eat pretty much.  I think this broke thing is going to be sort of good in that I'll get some habits back in line.  I don't need to go to a different restaurant everyday, for money and health, that's obscene...you just get into this rhythm of going to restaurants with your friends to hang out.  I used to complain that nobody 'did anything' and that everything revolved around eating & drinking and it's kinda true.  But I think that's about to come to an abrupt stop, at least for me.    I moved into that 'ugly' apartment (the ski lodge), which is actually incredibly comfortable and inviting!  Edwin and I are on Cloud 9.  And Soup, too, except he needs a better spot and to be pampered.  I'm really, really happy with the place.  10 minutes to get to work, I can go home for lunch if I want, close to everything.  Really don't even need the car that much, if it weren't for this insufferable heat.  Had some really good phone conversations last night; Matt, Delaney, Amanda.  Complaining to Matt about something and then immediately after I got off the phone with him started working on the remedy.  Sometimes it's good to float.  To not be pigeonholed.  You can scan and see everything for what it is without that one perspective from your rut (good rut or bad).  Going to see a bunch of art openings with Delaney and others.  The Big Show at the Art Car Museum, Mixture, and also Teresa's opening at CACHH.  Good stuff (and free)!    Working on this scanning project at work that they haven't been able to get going with their ex-employess, seems like it should take a few months to complete.  I am going to try to complete it in a week.  get. shit. done.  I'm all or nothing about so many things.  No work, or crazy efficient work.  I need to play my bass soon, want that comfortable ease of playing, don't want to feel that struggle.  Going to set up a little studio area in my bedroom...whenever I get my 4-track back.  Need to figure out if I'm going to take classes in the fall.
