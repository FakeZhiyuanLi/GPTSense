         Wasting time and money, great summer, oh yah!     So yesterday was like...nothing. i sat around, and tried to do algebra ratios for an hour. that was really productive. i got like two phone calls. dustin- wanting to do something, but called too late and it wasn't worth it. breanne- on ericks phone, wanting me to come to the wedding dance, but i said i wanted to sit at home, and i wouldn't even drive in there anyways like they wanted me to.      that made me think, does erick do shit behind my back?? like go out, and drink, and flirt w/ girls??? probably.       yep, so then i just sat at home. and today, me and brooke tanned. i talked to kara. and me and brooke went to town, got some pizza, bought me a belt and a new purse. its so cute, its cordorouy w/ stars printed w/ the cordorouy somehow and brown, and made by dickies. so its perfect for fall. i give it **** four stars!! lol. ...i think we went to town, just to go to town, woo. oh, and i bought like ALL the chocolate de vanilla chupa chups, and ALL the flan de vanilla chupa chups. YUM YUM. i'll probably eat them all today too.      but jeez, i hope i see erick today.... otherwise i feel like a waste of time gettin up and dressed.

         This may be who I am...     last nite, i as i was trying to sleep, i was thinkin allot about myself... about what makes me up mentally, pyschically, and everything in between. so now i think i better express that, before i forget everything i put allot of thought into. which i will be expressing, in none other than ramblings...and i would never have it any other way.      x)im proud im lutheran, i don't know why. i was raised it, but compare it to other christian religions it seems more moderate and easy going...not strict and crazy sounding. heaven is a gift from jesus, accept it...thats all u have to do to be a lutheran.   x)im addicted to sugar, not beer or malt liqour, marijuana, or cigarettes like other kids my age. i would rather be on the internet, and have a lollipop or something large and sugary. i think its pretty sad, because it never does cross anyones mind...but, im always buy stupid sugary shit like liquid lollipops, giant pixie sticks, and sugar babies. im amazed im not fat, hopefully i won't be fat because of it...but i think i need help.   x)i hate listening about peoples mental disorders. thats why im not taking psychology. if you read anything about mental disorders, or crap like that, then you start seeing everyone as a disorder statistic or something....i don't think thats a healthy way to look at people, seeing they are individuals and not a scientific classification.   x)i drive away my friends. i tell them i don't want to do anything- when i do, i tell them i'll call them-which i know i won't have time to, or want to. or, i stop talking to them, knowing we'll drift apart, and then yearn to talk to them about the same things we used to talk about, but its never the same.   x)i want to be successful, so bad, in life. being raised by my dad who flaunts it probably made me this way. i could have changed it though...but i like living like theres only one reason to, and only to be successful. perhaps its just extreme ambition? x)i love astrology. it makes me feel like theres an explanation for everything people do in their lives, or why they are the way they are. i like meanings of names too...like if i name my kid something that means success, she/he will be successful. wonderful.x)i cry when i see handicap people. like, i think how i could have been born like that, seeing me and brooke are twins. i feel so bad, like they could be so much more active in life, and feel so much better about themselves if they'd be "normal". x)i raised myself. in kindergarten, our parents got divorced. i had no mom to do laundry, i had no mom to teach me how to do my hair or makeup. sure, dads a great dad, but can not do what a mom can do. or have a maternal sensitivity. im missing a part of me, which a girl is suppose to have. like sensitivity, a ladylike quietness about life or opinions. which in turn makes me extremely independent, and i don't take shit. x)i hate exercise and sports. but i love gymnastics, wish i could have been a cheerleader that can do tumbling. and i like swimming, i love the water. it makes me feel very at home. x)i want to save animals... it seems right, and i have allot of love for any animal, especially marine animals.   x)i want to be one of those people that a person meets, and can't forget for no good reason. i want to be charismatic, powerful, fun loving, sincere, and secure about themselves.   x)im afraid of razors and bees.      all done. that was fun, and made me think allot about myself.

         Out on town with Brooke.     So me and brooke made it into town. and im oh so happy, because i bought a really cute fuji camera, and some jewelry. and tried to find a battery for my automatic unlock thing for the car, but i have to order another thing because i put this one through the washer. its like...40 dollars too, so that sucks. but other than that, we ate at a new mexican resturant. called mexico lindo, got some free gum,but the food wasn't  THAT  great. on the way home, i picked up some chupa chups, flan de vanilla, YUM YUM, yo. they're so tasty. lol.       on the other hand of my great day, im kinda frustrated with myself. because i can't understand ratios, and thats the last part of my at home intermediate algebra class. i can't wait to get erick to do it all for me :) mwhahaha. well, till next time...im over and out.

          I woke up late, on accident.      i meant to wake up kind of early, and do some laundry- which i am still doing, but I woke up at 12. i realized that it was like, 2 weeks until school starts. and me and my sister haven't worked in a month and a half. so therefore, we have no money to even buy school clothes... which is dilemma one. Dilemma two, would be that in our eyes, we have done nothing this summer. i have pretty much sat around, watched tv, sat on the computer, worked a little bit, taken a college astronomy class, taken an alg. class, mowed the lawn a couple times, tanned, saw my mom for a month, and....saw my boyfriend. woo. thats not much to me, so im very disappointed, see this is my   last summer before my senior yr, then next summer i have to prepare for college   . so, i feel old, and unaccomplished.       2 weeks....what can a person do in two weeks to make themselves feel accomplished? well, what do i think i need to accomplish before school starts? i think i need to buy my school clothes, but i can't do that unless i work my ass off uber bad in the next two weeks! so cross that off. do something exciting? well, trapt is playin at a state fair in sioux falls on aug. 8th....but i doubt me and brooke could go there for it, although it'd be really fuckin awesome.      maybe its all psychological...seeing, now that i read all that, it doesn't seem like those really make a person more accomplished. they sound materialistic. i guess i need to get over it, b/c other kids have wasted there summers on even less things then i have around here...      well, good post brittany!! ((clap clap)) horray, im expressing my feelings... i feel allot better.

          Noooo, not a pop vinyl record- silly!      well, i know i already posted today. but i figured that i would do an explanation for the blog's name. seeing it may come off as unusual, and may spark your interest, as of why i chose it. right? lol yah.      well, its the name of a scent, of a perfume, by Chupa Chups. Its Chupa Chups I Love Me in Pop Vinyl.   it smells sooo good. and i got it last summer, but i can't find it anywhere right now, except for on two foreign perfume websites.  urlLink  www.douglas.de   &amp;  urlLink  www.beautyfive.com  .       but anyways, thats enough of my problems....  urlLink  now heres a look of the actual bottle  !   it even looks awesome, huh? lol.

         welcome back to blogger, brittany.     this is my first blog since... like two years ago. which i am now 17. i used to be addicted to the internet, having little silly websites on expage. trying my hardest to make a creative and attractive site with random uploading sites.      so, needless to say, those were very short lived and pieces of crap with cute colored css codes.   now, i will have a blog... again for free, lol... but this will just be for a journal of some sort, seeing i don't write in my tanglible one, and i need to express myself otherwise my head gets too full of feelings and i  don't  function well in life :)      lets see, what else to say...not much, tomorrow will be my first blog entry, so the internet better brace itself.
