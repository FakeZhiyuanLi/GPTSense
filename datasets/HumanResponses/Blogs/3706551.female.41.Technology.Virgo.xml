      I think that this is what I want on my gravestone:  "What you GET from others is how you make a living, what you GIVE to others is how you make a life."  I think that's a nice saying, and is something that makes people think.  Things that make you go HMMMMMMMM........   urlLink What do you want on YOUR gravestone?

      Just found out that my brilliant  urlLink cousin  will be in Santa Monica giving a conference on Dynamic Cognition & Neural Networks, and I will take him to lunch. If you want to see what a really smart guy he is, take a look at  urlLink this . Or why not grab a Starbucks and tuck into  urlLink his dissertation  (only 156 pages!!!).  Needless to say, he is the genius of the family and, comparitively speaking, I have the IQ of a geranium :) Back to my Spongebob cartoon ....

      I have two friends that are biking around the world.  Nooo, that's not a typo!  They started in California in April of 2002 and are now in South Africa ... they plan to cycle back to the U.S. via Antarctica & South America.  They keep an online journal of their adventures, and boy they've had some gnarly ones!  Would you like to read about them? Then click  urlLink here  silly!!  I have some biking adventures of my own planned.  Across Great Britain is one of them.  I would also like to bike around New Zealand.  For now, I will read the stories of my adventurous friends.  Take a look!!

      I am a lesbian who is married to a man who is the father of my child.  Convoluted, I know. But I believe that my son is better off with both his Mom & Dad in the home .... soooo, here we are.  The name of my blog, "I'm Not Here to Do What You Please", is from the title of a song written by  urlLink Teresa Russell , who's CD you need to  urlLink buy .  She is the most awesome female rock guitarist ..... EVER!  If you can't afford it, I will send you one.  Yes, you need it that badly!  I am into golfing and just bought a new set of  urlLink Lady Callaway Gems  .... I love them!  The things I love about golf are being close to nature, the mental challenge, and the workout.  It's not just about chasing the ball around, ladies!  Golf with me and you will also have fun!! Not only that, I will tell you the story about the day I golfed with three drunk guys .....  I also love cats.  I have two and, no, I am not a  urlLink crazy cat lady . When I figure out how to post pictures, you'll see them both.  They are gorgeous and quite finicky.  Seems like the beautiful cats are always a little hoity-toity, and the short-haired strays are real lap kitties.  I like mountain biking and have a nice  urlLink Cannondale . Unfortunately I don't get to do it enough.  Must make more time for that!  I also love motorcycles and will be getting one as soon as my son is off to college.  Sorry all you Harley lovers, but I think that they are TOO LOUD!!!!  YES, I AM SCREAMING OVER YOUR HARLEY ENGINE EVEN AS WE SPEAK!!! PLEASE GET A MUFFLER, OR BETTER YET, A  urlLink HONDA VTX1300S . THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH!!!!!!!!  How can I commune with nature at 500 decibals?  It can't be done.  No Harley for me, thank you :)  I am a  urlLink Network Engineer  and so, of course, I love computers.  After all, I make them behave, for a living :)  More blogging fun to come!!! Stay tuned.

      Been on an emotional rollercoster lately.&nbsp; One of my friends was diagnosed with cancer and decided to end her life by shooting herself.&nbsp; She was 50 yrs. old, had just recently married, and has a 10 yr. old son.&nbsp; I'm having a hard time processing this ... and I'm pissed off at her for doing this to her son.&nbsp; She has sentenced him to a life of emotional hell. Why didn't she call me, or one of her other friends, when she had the gun to her head?&nbsp; Why didn't she look at me and say "I can make it through this thing" (I am a cancer survivor)?&nbsp; Instead she pulled the trigger.&nbsp; Now she's gone forever.&nbsp;And her son doesn't have a mommy.&nbsp; Suicide is a permanent solution to temporary problems.&nbsp; Rest in peace my friend, because we won't.  Just when I thought this was the lowest point, I heard that my ex-boyfriend was killed in a car accident along with his wife & one of his kids.&nbsp; He leaves behind a son whom he was very close to.&nbsp; This guy was the salt of the earth.&nbsp; He was the most polite & respectful person I've ever met.&nbsp; He use to leave me love notes on my car windshield every day.&nbsp; His greatest wish in life?&nbsp; To be a father.&nbsp; And I bet he was a damn good one, too.&nbsp; It is such a shame that a great person like him died so young.&nbsp; The world needed him ..... so did his son.  I promise my next blog entry will not be so much of a downer.&nbsp; >^..^

      Though all the corporate world tries desperately to force me into being a "morning person", it never was and never shall be.&nbsp; All my life I have been a night owl.&nbsp; As a young girl, my mother would come into my bedroom, vacuuming imaginary dust bunnies, in an effort to get me out of bed on Saturday mornings.&nbsp; I hated that disrespect, and therefore do not do that to my kids.&nbsp; As a teen & young adult, I was late every day for my 7 a.m. job and damn proud of it.&nbsp; And to this day, I am at least 5 minutes late to work on my 8 o'clock days .... sometimes more.&nbsp; I never have had the urge to pop out of bed 2 hrs. before I have to be somewhere, putter around & drink coffee.&nbsp; My grandfather did that.&nbsp; He would get up at 4:00 a.m. every day to putter around.&nbsp; I'm glad that floats his boat, but honey, it doesn't make my butter-fly.&nbsp; When I retire, I will listen to my body's inner rhythms and sleep when I want to, and stay up half the night.&nbsp; Meanwhile I silently curse the corporate idiots who deem 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. to be the hours of productivity.&nbsp; Sons of bitches.&nbsp; Who died and made you the official time keepers?  Angelina Jolie just got a 12 inch tattoo of a tiger on her back.&nbsp; I read in a book that she gets (ahem)  sexual pleasure  from getting a tattoo.&nbsp; Would love to be a fly on the wall of that tattoo parlor.&nbsp; Damn!

      This weekend I saw the stunning  urlLink Ms. Diana Krall &nbsp;in concert at the Santa Barbara Bowl. OK girls, is she not the most stunning creature on the face of the planet?&nbsp; And she is SO shy! Clearly the only place that she is truly comfortable on-stage is behind her baby grand.&nbsp; But it's one of the things that makes her utterly charming.&nbsp; And Diana, if any of your peeps are reading this (three cheers for webot spiders),THANK YOU SO MUCH for taking the stage on time!&nbsp; This shows that you respect &amp;&nbsp;value your fans.&nbsp; Unlike this  urlLink rock divum  (what is the masculine form of diva? divum??) who was a full HOUR late in taking the stage.  &nbsp;  Back to Ms. Diana!&nbsp; Her voice is pure heaven! and her piano playing divine.&nbsp; Her humor is very understated &amp; sotto voce (under her breath) ..... so you better listen up, or you'll miss her true wit &amp; charm.&nbsp; Typical New England humor from the girl from Nanaimo, B.C.&nbsp; It will take me weeks to come down from this high.&nbsp; There is only 1 other concert that effected me thus--ly.&nbsp; Click  urlLink here  for&nbsp;musical greatness.&nbsp;  urlLink Here  is pretty damn great too.  &nbsp;  So if you'll pardon me while I go buy EVERY CD that Diana has ever made ...... later folks.

      I've been getting a lot of email from this Blog asking if I am a femme, or what. Based on my published interests, there may be some confusion.  I would catagorize myself as femme on the streets but butch between the sheets. I come off at first glace as a very conventional femme, but anyone who knows me will tell you that this is just how it appears.  The rest is, surprisingly, more complex & complete. Although the inner machinations of my mind are far from being a COMPETE enigma, I can throw a perfect spiral, and troubleshoot a network.  I can make a Thanksgiving dinner, and edit a PC's registry.  I can decorate my bedroom in pink, but out-drive the average chick at golf.  I'm waiting for all of you  urlLink Annika Sorenstam s to email me. Show me that you can drive your  urlLink Nike Mojo  further than you drive to go on vacation. Does this anwer your question? or does it create more!

      The Fourth of July was great for my family but bad for the kitties! They were running in circles, trying to hide. Our idiot neighbors across the street were shooting off bottle rockets &amp; Roman candles over our house. The cats were freaking. Since my husband does not allow the kitties inside the house (don't get me started on THAT one, girls), I SLEPT OUTSIDE ON THE BACK PORCH WITH THE KITTIES. They snuggled up on the comforter &amp; slept soundly through the night. Not only did my husband not get any pussy, but I guess that also makes me a  urlLink CRAZY CAT LADY .

      Sometimes something happens that makes you feel bad.  I had been exchanging emails with one of my friends about relationships, past & present, that have been/are bad.  I was at my friend's house yesterday and we talked about my current relationship with my husband.  During the conversation, my friend told me of a dream she had the night before that involved her ex-boyfriend and domestic abuse.  I feel very responsible for bringing up dark memories & experiences that are deep in her subconscious, yet come out in her dreams.  I feel that I have indirectly hurt her, and that hurts ME really badly.  I would never want to cause her any pain.  She is a dear friend, and I owe her an apology.  As well as a "cease and desist" from any further dialog regarding relationships from hell. Here's to SWEET dreams .... not dark ones :)

      I decided to read Dr. Laura's book "The Proper Care &amp; Feeding of Husbands" in an attempt to better meet the needs of my husband. There is some shit in that book that I'm not willing to wrap my brain around, girls. Here's a quote from pg. xxii: "And at the end of the day .... roll over in bed, close your eyes, give him a big hug, AND REMEBER THAT WITHOUT HIM, YOU ARE ONLY A SORRY EXCUSE FOR A PERSON [empahasis mine], but as half of the team, you are invincible."   Give me a FUCKING break! No one is a sorry excuse for a person just because they are not hooked up with somebody else in a relationship. This is FUCKING LUDICROUS! In fact, I believe that you better be happy on your own before you can successfully hook up with someone else in any kind of long term relationship. If you don't enjoy your own company, how can you expect anyone else to either. Dr. Laura says some other shit that will blow your mind too. You should read Chapter 6 "What's Sex?" Here's a quote from pg. 133: CALLER: "Should I be expected to have sex when I don't want to just because he wants to?" DR LAURA: "Most of the time, yes. .... It's called loving obligation."   No wonder women don't want to be married to men. Why are families going to hell in a handbasket? Read this book &amp; you'll find out.    urlLink Here  is how another chick feels about Dr. Laura ... read it, it's funny!
