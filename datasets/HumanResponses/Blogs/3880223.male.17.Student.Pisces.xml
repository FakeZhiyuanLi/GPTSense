      "I am on the verge of surrendering...even if this war is not over yet."   THE WAR  I think this is my first taste of college life. Just after a month, here I am, already ready to raise my white flag...  Hindi ko na kaya ang week na to...feeling ko any moment now sasabog na ako!!!  Sobrang dami ng requirements, so many teachers to please, so many people to meet, and so little time to do all of these things! I really don't know how to go on with this life...may punyetang play pa na dapat panoorin!   THE BAGOONG RICE  But anyway, what was really great about this week is our first Chem block lunch out in World Topps Katipunan. Everyone was there except for some few people (like Lovelyn) who were not able to go because of some unexplainable circumstances... But the good thing was, we had our first social bonding, and of course, the food was great. If not, truly tasty. The Kao Pad I ordered (Thai Bagoong Rice, that is) just made my day...plus I ate it using chopsticks...considering it's Thai...   WILL I SURVIVE?  Yes, I'm sure I will because this week is pretty much closing its doors...plus I get to eat more bagoong rice in the future...or perhaps I'll try there Katsudon or something...=)

      The Math Exam...it wasn't really a pain in the ass...it was more of a pain in the brain!  I really have to eat a lot tonight to compensate for my damaged brain cells...oops, sorry...damaged neurons cannot be replaced right? damn! I mean, after my "brain cell contortion" act during the Math exam, I still have no idea if I have enough brain cells left to understand my Chem pre-lab for tomorrow...=(  I think I am becoming really stupid these days...I got a 10 out of 19 in English, I can't understand this story entitled Rebecca in Lit, then these damn conic sections and systems of equations just screws the hell in my day...oh what a perfect life!  I mean, I thought that I really had a good chance of nailing my subjects this year. After high school, I thought college would be more simple...but life really has a lot of suprises...especially here in the Ateneo...life's just pretty damn hard out here!!!  But I am not angry. I am just pissed of. Those Math exams can really bring out the evil inside of you. I mean, those math problems, they were like evil in the mathematical form or something...

      Sunday was such a blast!   I mean it was like the best day ever since the OrSem days...gosh! Why am I talking like this? I guess it's just the MEANgirls syndrome...   Neway, nag-mass kami sa Santuario de San Antonio ni RenRen and my aunt and then we went to G4 to watch Mean Girls. It was so cool and so funny, as in! Lindsay Lohan is such a sexy bitch and all the other mean girls were really fugly sluts...=)   And then, when we finally went home to our shelter, we were so glad na hindi pa tapos yung Ateneo-La Salle game and we were still able to scream our lungs out (GET THAT BALL! GET THAT BALL!).    And then of course, the moment of truth came when Ateneo finally won over the archers! 72-75! Close fight talaga! Pero well, I guess the better team won...hihihihi...thanks to Fonacier and Tenorio who really saved the Ateneo ass. We weren't there but we really felt like we were there, especially when Mar Roxas was cheering proudly while wearing his trademark blue polo..i mean, the school spirit was just so ecstatic!    Anyway, Sunday was really a great day!   P.S. Watch mean girls. It is the best comedy this year!

      Today, I got my guidance test results and of course, the usual things came up, that I am this shitty sensing and active learner, that I use more of my heart than my head, that I am judging, that I am this and that.  But what really made my sock creep out of my shoe was this thing about me being more of an Introvert. Yack! It's creepy. Hello? I am an extravert (not extrovert....they're different)! People of the world, I am like so sociable and friendly. Heller?!   Just look at this. What's the point of this blog spot here proving that I need social interaction, that I am not some dreamy boy reflecting about the depth of life.  But anyway, it really sucks knowing something about yourself that you never knew quite well existed. But its acceptance people, just a bit of acceptance, and I am well over this "in-denial-syndrome."

Run for the shower!   So, okay this morning sucked. I am so preoccupied with so many things...   Is copper the limiting reagent?   Did I pass my midterms?   What am I gonna have for lunch?      Okay...I'm done with my shower. I'm gonna wear this gray polo shirt and my faded maong pants...gotta start the day right with my Yakisoba breakfast....       At the Ateneo, CTC 112:  DAMN! No more computers left...aaahhh! Okay, don't panic...head for Prince David...just a ten-minute walk...      ...after one hour and 25 minutes...      I'm done with my post lab! Yeepee!

Sir Cabral: Okay, time's up...pass your papers...yes, Ms. Serena, you have to staple them together...      Me to myself: I hope I passed.      THOUGHT: Oooohh...I was able to solve everything. But duh?! Did you get them all right? Head back to reality baby!      An Hour Before   These chicken tenders are so yummy. I can eat two of these. But I can't be too full. I may get a stomach ache. Or worse LBM. I can't have that! I may not get to my 6 pm midterms...Okay, just one chicken tender...      Munch...munch...God, please no food poisoning today...I have to get to SOM 105 for the midterms...God forbid the bacteria from invading my food...      Okay, no more studying. I had enough! Condition your mind...okay, so now I am officially freaking out..I am having dragonflies in my stomach...yes I know they're butterflies...am not stupid...I wish the math midterms is not that long...      A Day Before   I am lying on my bed...I can't sleep, I have to pray first...Aubert's asleep?...Okay, no FRIENDS for today...no Chandler sarcasm...no Phoebe-stupidity...no O.C. Monica...no Rachel...no Ross...no How ya Doin Joey...      5 hours ago....I am at Jollibee having this study group...okay...solve! solve! solve!   Me to Za: How do you solve this function wherein there are absolute values at both the numerator and denominator? Okay..the range is {3, -1/3}...Thanks Za...I hope we pass midterms....
