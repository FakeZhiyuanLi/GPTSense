      Today is a beautiful, cold, sunny day.  Perfect for getting all those things done that i haven't got around to for ages.  Somehow i still can't be bothered.  Funny that. Bunny has set off on his bike to play football in the park with one of his old Trinity team-mates, I'm glad theyre keeping in touch. I was planning on using the nice weather to take my new bike out for a ride, but i can avoid that now too as bunny has made other plans.  I'll get around to it one day... Going to live in China gave me ther perfect opportunity to spring-clean my life, and I am so glad for it.  I left behind all the things that I no longer needed and came back to just the few things i really enjoy.  I also have come to appreciate what i do have far more.  I am lucky i managed to do this, it should be a requirement for everybody. Now I am feeling guilty I am wasting time so i really should get back to doing something useful.    Im just quickly reading up on the Chinese manned space flight before I go to meet the people from hefei tv to be interviewed on my opinion on it. We have a new marketing manager at school and he and simon have decided a great way to advertise the school is to make me a celebrity in hefei. Haha!!! shit.   Today it will all begin with radio and tv interviews on the space man, then tonight I have dinner with the mayor and some other government officials.  Simon has also arranged a special appearance on some style show to talk about my hair.  Hahaha!  I think he means talk about Australian fashion, but I couldn’t be sure…. Maybe I will just have to talk about my hair for an hour…. We discovered this new plan yesterday, because I had agreed to go on tracy’s radio show on Saturday, and Tim told simon “sally is going to be on radio on Saturday”.  Simon said “yes, at 11 o clock, hefei radio station.”  Apparently he had arranged that already…. So I had to postpone tracys show.

       urlLink     So many interesting thoughts come into my head when i am sitting on my balcony... pity all those thoughts stay out there when i come back in. ~Maybe if i set the view as my desktop it will create the same effect.  I had to take a photo of the moon looking like it does this evening.  It looked far nicer than it does in the photo, but it's still pretty here. Reminded me of the poem bunny desperately tried to teach me in order to impress his family.  Funny he chose that one, it always seems to appear in my life in all sorts of places, it is one of my favourites.   Night Thoughts  I wake and moonbeams play around my bed   Glittering like hoarfroast to my wondering eyes   Upwards the glorious moon I raise my head   Then lay me down and thoughts of home arise    T and I get great (childish) amusement at the complete innocence of the general population here.  I think I mentioned to you that when I was at dinner with j and our guide in yellow mountain, the guide asked with a very innocent expression “do you have “penus” in Australia?” J then asked “do you like “penus”?”  After a whole series of odd questions about Australian “penus”es, I realised that they were talking about “peanuts”, apparently a very difficult word to pronounce properly.  I couldn’t bring myself to explain what they were saying as I could just imagine their faces when I showed them the translation in j’s little electronic dictionary, so the word continues to be a problem.   I told t about the episode, so he pointed out peanuts to a few girls at work and asked what they were, to his great glee they confidently replied ““penus”!”  It also happens that our favorite tea at the coffee shop is peanut tea, so t carefully teaches “peanuts” to every waiter and waitress who passes our table.  Its so terrible but its impossible not to laugh.  You wouldn’t believe how often you can bring up peanuts in a conversation or in a class.      &nbsp; urlLink

      Perfect "Funniest Home Videos" episode occurred yesterday, pity it happened in China and we were back here in Melbourne with the DV. ml has apparently inherited the same love of ice-cream that bunny has.  The family took the usual trip to JiuHua mountain yesterday and sat ml down with an ice-cream to keep her occupied while they went to pray.  Three local monkeys spied ml with her ice-cream and tried to snatch it when she wasnt looking.  ml snatched her ice-cream back and ran off trying to finish her ice-cream as quickly as she could, but she wasn't quite fast enough.  The clever old monkeys caught little ml, picked her up over their heads and ran about while ml still refused to give up her prize.  All the family chased after the monkeys yelling and waving thier arms whereby the monkeys shuffled to the edge of the mountain and held ml high in the air, looking very smug.   "Give the monkeys the ice-cream!" the family yelled.  Big descision to be made for ml...  She eventually gave in and grumpily poked the ice-cream into the monkeys hands.   Silly monkeys then faught between themselves to eat as much ice-cream as they could as quickly as they could and promtly made themselves ill on their very cold treat. A lesson was learnt by all.  Is an ice-cream really worth it???    This morning we spent at this schools exhibition thingy at a uni near big mountain.  Tim was writing his email address on a pamphlet for someone enquiring about the school and I was sitting at our little display table folding leaflets when a bunch of school children stopped to have a look…. Soon they had created a “ooohh… look at that crowd, what is going on here?” atmosphere and we had dozens of people squishing into our booth asking for autographs.  Tina said someone in the little crowd had discovered Tim and I were Hollywood celebrities so everyone was very excited. Hmmm. Most of the boys on our staff kept mysteriously ending up in the booth opposite which  just happened to be a kung fu academy (that apparently trained arnold swartzenegger) where they would stand and look tough whenever cute girls walked past.

      I'm tired.  Theres been a few things happening lately, which is good because i prefer it that way than to have bunny bored.  But i'm tired. It's 9:30 now which means only seven hours to occupy until we set off to watch the euro2004 final at the bar down the road.  argh.    Friday afternoon we met gj's mum with her hefei tour group, it was good to see some hefei friends here, and even better to be able to bring gj's mum home to see where we live.  This was also the first time my parents have seen bunny being his natural self and not having to search for every word to say what he needs.  It made me feel like i had brought a little of my hefei life home.   Yesterday we had dinner at bunny's classmates house, 9 of us together.  Very sweet people and i love to see bunny feeling comfortable, speaking chinese and keeping everyone in stitches as usual.  It did make me realise, however, that i do understand a lot of Chinese still and am wasting such an opportunity not studying harder before i forget it all.  One of those things that will be always be shelved for another day....  Today was a good day, we spent the morning at moreland again as bunny played his second game with his new team.  It's a good club, so much better than his last. It was such good luck to have dan come down and introduce us to cd, funny how things always just seem to fall into place for bunny and i, everything just works out right.  Just caught the news update as i typed that.  Azaria Chamberlain case resurfacing?  Strange people out there.    My arm is still sore from bowling.  And I even somehow pulled a muscle in my bum too.   That’s how bad my bowling technique is.  Tim and David insist I am actually quite good considering I havent played for 100 years or so. They say that even though I threw the ball backwards once.  I think they might be lying.  We went on Monday night and it was so much fun I insisted we go on Tuesday as well (I thought seeing as I was now an experienced bowler that I was in with a chance for winning. Hahaaaa) I think that I entertained all the staff at the bowling club, when we turned up on Tuesday all their faces lit up and I could tell they were recounting my efforts for the unlucky ones who hadnt seen them first hand yet.

      I think the anniversary was supposed to be the point of that post.  Already limited attention spans tends to wander a little with lack of sleep.   We were rather outdone by the couple on the news who are today (yesteday in real time) celebrating their 70th wedding anniversary.  Congratulations to them. And look out to the certain wealthy businessman in Hefei who bet 10,000 RMB that bunny and i would be divorced within a year, are you beginning to sweat a little? Hope so.  So bunny, although you are too busy reading the sport pages to notice this little post, thank-you.  I adore you.  Happy anniversary.    There was a class test today for one of the children's classes.  Frank is a student in the class and he is really quite large.  One of the questions on the oral exam was “Is Frank fat?”  Even Frank was asked the question.  He didn’t seem to mind but I am sure some students pretended not to understand in case they came across frank after class in a dark hallway!

      So today was bunny and my 6 month wedding anniversary... actually yesterday was as it is now 1:12am.  ~I always consider days begin and end with my pattern of sleeping, not with the clock, it is today until i wake up tomorrow.~ Today was also bunny's graduation from citizenship school, he now has a fine certificate that allows him to avoid any further exams or classes if he wishes to become an Australian.  fantastic.  He still only knows the first word of the anthem... maybe thats what made him qualify, if the students learn all the words off by heart, they are considered "unaustralian" and booted out.   So, anyway, being the good wife i am, i thought i would bake bunny a cake for our anniversary and suprise him.  Bloody expensive cake it turned out to be as i forgot to put money in the supermarket meter and the philly cream cheese cost me $50 more than expected. I wonder what thoughts run through a parking inspector's mind as they discover a car belonging to a parking crim such as myself.  Is there a little inward "yeah!" as they clock up another catch for the day, or is it more of a "poor bugger, i'd love to look the other way, but my boss might find out." I must point out, i am just curious, I hold absolutely nothing against parking inspectors, as i fully understand that without them, no one would ever move their car and there would be no space for me to collect fines in in the first place.   I do tend to resent inspectors, however, who are bastards.  ~ of course i don't like bastards no matter what their profession so thats a little irrelevent really. There was the one fine i collected for "vehicle facing the wrong direction on the wrong side of the road". Yes, wrong direction, wrong side.   Is it possible to manage these feats simultaneously? The thing that upset me most about this fine was the fact that i received it at 6am on a Sunday in a small quiet street in which there were absolutely no parking restrictions (as long, of course, as you stuck to the right direction on the right side).  Sooo... What was the parking inspector doing in the street?  A random 6am-on-a-Sunday check of local streets to ensure all vehicles were sticking to their own side of the street? Nooo.... This parking inspector looked out his bedroom window this lucky morning and spied an infringement  right outside his bedroom window!   aha! What luck! Bastard.    All the little moths have gone from my room.  I think the maid dealt with it this morning.  We have a severe little-moth problem at school though.  After class yesterday, one of the girls went into the other classroom to collect her bag and came out screaming.  When we looked into the room (which is really large) it was FULL of little moths, I wouldn’t be surprised if there had been more than a thousand of them.  And after having the door open for only half a minute they had spread themselves through into reception.  Funnily enough, even though little moths seem to be pretty common here, everyone is terrified of them, so within a minute we had ten screaming girls running about waving their arms about in the air and hitting themselves.  They all left the building in the same way, which probably wont do much for our school reputation. Our class this evening was in the moth room, and when it started the moths were all sleeping on the roof so it wasn’t a problem, but by the end they were swooping about and scaring everybody which made conversation a little difficult.  Every few minutes a student would scream and throw all her books in the air then everybody would point at the moth and follow its progress until it travelled a safe distance away. While I was typing that a little moth came to join me.  I think he is trying to scare me.

      As he has every morning this week, bunny headed off to his citizenship class this morning.  Thank god that thing will be over tomorrow, poor bunny, can't be interesting. After that we set of to the optometrist to have his eyes tested.  ~ I'm suprised he allowed it, it's not like him to admit he is not  all  perfection.~  As the test was revealing how not-perfect his eyesight was he was only just beginning to show seeds of doubt... "she says my eyes are fantastic, right? ... right???" He did deal particularly gracefully with the optomestrist's two cats who took an instant shine to him and spent the entire consultation digging up under his jacket and climbing on his shoulders.   So now it's all over, bunny has contacts.  I feel much happier now he has them, especially as today he admitted he can't see in the evenings when car's headlights are coming towards him ~ and he still insists on my letting him drive at night.... He has gone off to football practice with his new conacts on so hopefully he will now wow them all with his new skills that have been unleashed along with his new night vision. Speaking of which, he was due to return at around 9pm and it is now 10.56pm.  I assume he has stayed back to watch euro2004 replays but i am beginning to get a little nervous.  And i finished my last cigarette before too.  damn... Now i will feel just that little more nervous.  It is really windy today, i hope he wasn't blown off the pier on his way back.  I shall go and peer out the window now and await his return.    I caused chaos in my children’s class today.  I started a game where one student would write a word on the board then the other students would put up their hand when they thought of a word that began with the last letter of that word i.e a neverending game.  It began very well with students putting up their hand and running to the board when they had a word…. Then they began to creep closer to the board so they could see the last letter before the others.  Eventually when they were told class had finished and they had to leave it became a mass rush to the board to write a word beginning with “n”.  Words included “no”, “now”, and “ne”.

      Right.... So I created this in a hurry without much thought into what to do with it and what to put in here.  I could write everything i think in here along with everything we do each day (within limits of course) and have myself a very detailed account of what exactly i have been up to. Now if i do that, i should remember anyone may stumble across this at any time and i do find the idea of sharing all my thoughts a bit odd.  So I'll keep it nice, keep the spelling errors to a minimum and pretend I'm just sending someone an email.  That should work.  Today seemed a good day to begin (a year ago would have been much better but there is little i can do about that now) as it is July 1; half way through the year (already!) and I have just remembered it is the eve of bunny & my 6 month wedding anniversary.   I had to double check that as i typed that as it is really hard to grasp where exactly all that time went.  It can't possibly be right~ (see... if i had started this a year ago there would not have been a problem here!)  I am hoping my life does continue to be as eventful as it has been for the last year, but i can't imagine how that would be possible. I think it will start to look a little duller each day from here on in.  It didn't seem quite right typing that either.  Life with bunny is  anything  but dull.  The constant entertainment offered by bunny, however, does tend to be of the visual variety and i just don't have the talent to quite convey the absolute hilarity here.  ~Maybe i will learn.~  Even when I attempt to retell a bunny episode it never comes across right.  You really must just meet him for yourself.  ~Where to go from here...??~  What if i had started this earlier?? What would it have included??     January 2003  - Take up job offer to teach in Taiwan, discover a week before leaving i need urgent surgery.  Postpone trip for a few weeks.  Discover I need to hang about for 6 months for follow up consultation.  Postpose trip for 6 months.   February 2003 - June 2003  - Spend much of my time feeling sorry for myself and working boring nothing jobs to fill in time until July.  Decide i can't handle boring nothing jobs and need to go back to university.   July 2003  Email Timu my old uni buddy to ask if he is still there because i might just be coming back soon.  Timu replies that he is teaching in China right now, would i like to join him.  "Perfect!" I think and tell him I will be there as soon as the little checkup is out of the way.  Unfortuately little checkup leads to more surgery and the requirement i return for another visit in November.  Jump on a plane anyway, still uncomfortable from surgery and head for Hefei.   August 2003  Rapidly work out for myself how to teach an english class as no-one is about to show me.  Soon teaching 7 classes of 60 students every Monday and Tuesday.  God knows how. Under normal circumstances i cant talk to 3 people at a time without becoming nervous.  New friend takes me on a trip to HuangShan ~ highly recommend it if you're in the area.   September 2003  Teach more.  Develop a reoccuring nightmare that i have fallen asleep in class and all the students are waiting for me to wake up and go on teaching.  I'm too embarrased, so go back to sleep.   October 2003  After failing to palm my new Friday class off onto the new teacher, drag myself into school and spy the handsome bunny in the reception.  Find out he is Timu's private student and promptly take over the classes, much to bunny's confusion.  Bunny doesn't speak a word of english.   November 2003   Bunny has picked up enough english to justify being my boyfriend by now.  Unfortunately he is studying english because he is off to England to go to Uni.  This is also the month I must go home to hospital agian.  Bunny's family take us on a trip to JiuHuaShan ~ also recommended if you're passing ~ and we decide i will go to England too, just as soon as all the hospital crap is out of the way. I go home.   December 2003  Back in HeFei before i know it, the three weeks apart were enough for bunny and I to decide getting married would be a nice idea.  Christmas day we head to the registry office and are turned away because i have no certificate from my embassy.  Not to worry, we were heading to ShangHai for new year anyway, can pick the certificate up then.   January 2004  Much to the suprise of all but a handful of people bunny and i get married and move into a really cute apartment on LuAn Lu ~ still miss it. Decide the visa office in Bejing are taking too long to process bunny's British visa and begin to make plans to return to Aus instead.   February 2004-March 2004  Undergo great deals of stress about preparing a spouse visa for bunny.  Everybody we speak to tells us it will take years.  We imagine years of being seperated while i go back and forth to hospital and bunny waits.   April 2004  Lodge our application for bunny's visa and it is approved in under 3 weeks.  It must be a world record.  29th we fly to HK and bunny meets the first of the family ~ the "test run" family.   May 2004  Still in shock at the speed of it all we arrive in Melbourne.  Every day is something new ~ far too much to write here!     We have nescafe coffee at home now, and I know how to use the weirdo stove but I am really craving a real coffee.  All the coffee shops here don’t get it quite right.  Yesterday I had a “cappucino coffee” that came the closest to real coffee so far, but it was stale black coffee with thick sweet cream on top generously sprinkled with orange rind and hundreds and thousands.  The coffee menus are all unbelieveably long at each place I have found, so I think eventually I will find a nice normal coffee.  I will leave the “beer coffee” to tim to try though I think.

      Don't really know what to do here.  Was considering starting myself a diary to keep track of things but i guess thats a little old fashioned and not nearly as convenienet as this.... could work out quite well or could just fade away after a week or so.  Should have thought of this a year ago. Bugger.  I shall make up for my delay in creating a blog by adding random bits of emails i sent from Hefei into each post, maybe eventually i will have most of it covered.    Its 12pm here now and the street is still so noisy.  I woke up at 4 or so in the morning the other day and it was really quiet so I couldn’t get back to sleep.  The funniest thing I’ve heard is the man looking for steve.  Tim told me about him a while ago and I heard him for the first time this morning.  I have no idea what the guy is actually yelling but you could swear he is calling “stee-eve… steve? Steeeve!”  and you can hear him for miles going around the block and down the street and back again.
