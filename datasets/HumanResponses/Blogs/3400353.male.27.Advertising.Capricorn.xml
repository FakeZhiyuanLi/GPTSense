          When I was 6 years old I discovered Madonna. Like any other  future fag of america  I became obsessed. Years passed and she was replaced w/ my current reigning diva, Martika (1989-present). That's not to say I still don't like her. Ever since  Justify My Love  I've had a love/hate relationship w/ the woman. Her last album  American Life  has it's moments. Now that it's flopped she's touring. And a greatest hits tour at that! Ticket prices are outrageous and she's sold out 4 nights here in Chicago. Now the Madonna-bug has hit the bf and I. So in our determination to get tickets (she's doing  Burning Up  for christsakes!!) we are having an ebay sale. I love ebay! Already one of my cd's I deemed junk has garnered $29 in bids! Woo hoo! Madonna tickets are all over  urlLink ebay.com . Wish us luck in raising money for our cause :)

          Fangoria's new album was just released in Spain. Being the impatient  mofo  I am, I was not about to wait for a domestic release (God knows when that will be??). A friend I made via the  urlLink Kylie Minogue  message boards from Spain has been kind enough to send me the new CD+DVD combo as well as the first single w/ remixes. The first single is  wicked ! It is called  Retorciendo Palabras  and if it's any indication of what the new album is like I am sure I will love it. As it is I am a big Alaska whore, so I am sure I will not be anything but satisfied. You can hear samples of their new album via their brand new website (due to the fact they are no longer w/ Subterfuge and now part of Dro)... urlLink arquitecturaefimera.com . Below is what the cover looks like. Juanix, my Spanish friend, said he sent them off this week so I should be getting them shortly! I hate waiting! I must get back to listening to my  loud bitches  mix I just made on my ipod (Mónica Naranjo, Cyndi Lauper, Pattie Labelle, Tina Turner, Anastacia, etc.).

          Today the new live Cyndi Lauper DVD came out. I've seen her live 3 times and she is simply amazing. I just saw her last February 13 @ the Cadillac Palace here in Chicago. The setlist is pretty much the same setlist. A few tracks from her latest album  At Last  and tons of hits like some of my personal faves  Shine, Change of Heart, All Through The Night, Sisters of Avalon, I Drove All Night, etc.  So get your copy today at  urlLink amazon.com .

      My boyfriend and I just got back from Mexico City. It is simply amazing! I live in Chicago and now it seems like such a small place compared to Mexico. It gets such a bad rap. People go on and on about how dangerous it is and what not. Blah blah. I have nothing but good things to say. With a population of 24+ million, it's a very happening city. Lots to see and do. So let's start...with the  ANGEL DE LA REVOLUCION ...       We stayed in la Zona Rosa which is a great neighborhood in Mexico City. Our hotel,  Posada Viena Hotel  was in a great location in Colonia Juarez. Pretty much close enough to public transporation, you've never experienced a train system 'til you've taken the metro in Mexico City. Not only is it dirt cheap (by American standards), it's incredibly fast and efficient. We pretty much got around everywhere on it. Below is a picture of us taken at el Templo Mayor in el Zócalo.        El Zócalo  is located in the centro histórico. It is a slew of people, markets, shops, etc. As you can imagine we were in heaven. While there we visited  el Templo Mayor  which are the old ruins that are in the middle of this metropolis. Quite a site to see. Below are two photos. The first in the mercado, and the second of the ruins.           One of my favorite stops was  Coyoacán  where we visited  La Casa Azul , otherwise known as Frida Kalho's house. It was amazing. To be in the very house where the majority of her masterpieces were created was an experience that can not be described.       Another site of interest that has to be seen when visiting Mexico City is the  Museo de Antropología  (Museum of Anthropology). It contains the original Aztec Calendar, artifacts from the Aztecs and the Mayans and so much more. The trip alone was worth seeing the expression on Rob's face when he saw the Aztec Calendar in person :)            Believe it or not we did not get to experience much nightlife in Mexico City  (gasp! shock! horror!)  It's a long story. But we did get to go out w/ some new friends. My best friend Alethya is originally from Mexico City so she gave us the hook-up w/ her cousins. So we went out bar hopping and drank tons of tequila. All to my delight :)   So what did we do the majority of our time? Why  shop  I tell you! Since Rob and I are both CD whores, we were in heaven in Mexico City. Between the two of us we bought at least 100 CD's (that's not including pirated music!!). Let me tell ya about the pirated music in Mexico City. Every corner you go there are bootleg CD's, DVD's (which we bought plenty of), etc. It is bootleg galore! Bought some nicknacks, etc. The one thing I did want but was not able to find were shoes. Everyone in Mexico City has tiny tiny feet! I am a size 12. Granted it's a big size, but it's pretty common here in the States. Well not in Mexico City. The biggest size I could find most of the time was  9 or 10. Needless to say Imelda didn't get to expand her shoe collection this trip. I did find one pair however :) Below is a picture of me in  Mix Up  the biggest CD chain in Mexico. Holding a copy of Sasha's  Siento  album. Speaking of Sasha for those of you who cared, I found a copy of her debut on CD the day before I left!        Of course we did not want to come back. But alas we did. Mexico City I will miss you greatly! I hope to go back soon. If I found a job there I would move in a heartbeat! I leave you with some more final images. First is  La Zona Rosa  where we stayed and the last a view from our cab on the way to the airport.

          I AM A BLOG VIRGIN! This is my first post. I've always seen blogs online and wondered what the hell they were. So as the Cranberries once said: "Everybody else is doing it, so why can't we?" Ok so in this case it's just me. But you get the point. So what exactly will I write about? God only knows. To start off let's start w/ my title...QUIERO SER SANTA. For anyone who knows me they know I have several musical obsessions (we'll get to the others in later posts...TRUST ME!) and one of them happens to be the Mexican Acid Queen herself, Alaska.    Alaska was part of Spain's  Movida Madrileña  during the post-Franco days. She's fronted several groups since the 80's from Pegamoides to Dinarama to her current act Fangoria. I love this woman! She's not much of a singer but she just exudes this fabulousness that I can't explain. Anyhoo, "Quiero ser santa" is a song from Alaska y Dinarama's 1989  FAN FATAL . It's a really funky trashy new wavey song and it fits me to a tee! Thus when deciding what to name my blog, I thought..."Hey why not Alaska!"    Hopefully I will not bore everyone to death w/ my rantings, opinions, suggestions, etc. So I hope you'll join me in upcoming rants via... QUIERO SER SANTA .

      Remember that episode of  Friends  where Ross got to pick his top 5 celebs he could sleep with? Here's how it works: you're in a relationship but if one of your 5 came along it's ok to sleep with them. The other day this topic came up, so I figured I'd share my picks with you. Pictured left to right (in no order):  Alejandro Fernández; Colin Farrell; Jaime Camil; Javier Bardem & Alex Dimitriades.

      I am trying to get into the habit of writing here once a day. So I am still hating my job. Big surprise, right? So I should be working on something, but I don't feel like it. I've looked again, and still nothing that interests me. At this point I am just applying for things to apply. Back to being boring (hey that could be a Pet Shop Boys pun!). Went to sayhey, bored again, so what else can I talk about? Pride! This weekend is the Gay Pride Parade here in Chicago. I am not really into the whole political aspect of it, I am who I am. People are either gonna accept it or not. Can't change the world, I don't see it as some big crusade or anything. Honestly it's just a good excuse to let loose and get disgustingly piss drunk! So here's to pitchers at Roscoe's!

          Ask yourself this question. When's the last time you heard a singer that just left you in awe? As anyone who knows me probably can attest to, I have my fare share of faves (mostly trashy female singers, preferably peaking in popularity in the late 80s and/or early 90s). Earlier this year while at my parents business I saw a video for this singer  Elan  on Telehit called "Midnight". Telehit is a cable channel from México. She kinda looked like Ludwika Paleta (the annoying Mexican soap actress) and kinda sounded like Hanson. Then the hubby and I started hearing more about her. Downloaded some tracks and were hooked. After looking up some more info on her I found out she was indeed Mexican, from Guadalajara to be exact. She has been living in the US since age 15, and felt the only way to get her voice heard was to sing in the universal language, English. So I went on ebay, bought the Mexican import (it has also been released in Australia) of her debut album   Street Child   and have not put it down since. I can not begin to tell you all how amazing this girl is.    I can not stop listening to this album! It is quickly becoming one of my faves. Her voice is simple, no over singing a la Christina Aguilera/Kelly Clarkson/Joss Stone here. Just emotion, honesty, soul and passion all coming out of this woman's mouth. The music is at times dark and moody, yet it is so simple and elegant. I honestly can not say that any other album released in the last couple of years has sucked me in like this. I listen to this at least once a day. Never do I get sick of it. Every song is amazing, but I must say my favorite is  The Road .   She wrote all the lyrics and music on every track. Each song was done in one take. If she didn't get it in one take, it didn't make it on the album. The album was produced by her brother and features ex-GNR Slash on the title track. It's so rare that an artist comes along w/ such an amazing debut where you can honestly sit through every song in awe. I just hope that she gets a US release soon, as I'd love to see her live. In fact I  must  see her live. For now I can imagine via this picture.       Do yourselves all a favor. Get this cd if you have not! I know it's only available as an import right now but it is so worth it. You can find it cheap on  urlLink ebay.com  or get it at  urlLink amazon.com . To learn more about Elan and to hear samples of her debut please visit  urlLink her official website . You'll thank me later. She's gonna be one to watch.

      5 years. Too long. One job for 5 years. I need to find something else. I am so bored. 5 years (this August) I moved to Chicago and started working @ the ad agency. It's become mundane and beyond boring. Crappy pay, blah blah. What else can I complain about? Seriously I need a change and fast! Maybe I need to get out of Chicago; not sure. My BF keeps talking about Seattle, WA. Maybe? Monster.com, etc. here I come! Anyone know of any good art director positions let me know!    Enough ranting. Had a great weekend. Went to mootown (Milwaukee, WI) and house sat for the rents. Best of all we dog sat for my old college roomie. Shakespeare was a doll and just seeing how happy Rob's face was, can't explain. Makes me want to terminate our lease and just get a dog already! Sat. was a baby shower for my good friend Bertha :) It was a "gay baby shower" as it was mostly gay boys and few straight girls (and the 2 lesbians!). It was too much fun. Pictures to come. Let me get back to the boredom I call my job.

          So Monday my friend from work invited me to go see Robi Dräco Rosa @ the Double Door. I had a few of his rock en español cd's from back in the day. He's touring to promote his latest release  Mad Love . Let me just say that apart from putting on an awesome show, he has to be one of the hottest men alive. OMG he is gorgeous!!! We got to meet him at a meet and great afterwards, just waiting for Ms. Diaz to give me the pic and I will post for all to see :)   My other news is that...the Madonna tickets arrived today via FedEx! In honor of them arriving I think I will listen to some Madonna on my ipod ( 'Til Death Do Us Part  anyone?). If you haven't noticed whenever I report the updates on our tickets all the pics tend to be brunette shots. I know this may sound weird but I only like her when she's a brunette. My fandom tends to go up. Even though she's a blond again, but let's just pretend. Ok?       Also I'm trying to lose weight again :( Since being w/ my parnter I gained back weight I had previously lost (pretty much all). So Gazelle here I come! I can do it; I did it once before I can do it again! Wish me luck.

          We finally raised enough money to get Madonna tickets on ebay! So Wed. July 14, 2004 you can see w/ all the other homos @ the United Center! The best part is we didn't even have to pay for these out of our own pockets. Just from selling old stuff on ebay. Since we also have to pay for Gloria Estefan tickets, the sale continues. So if you'd like, please visit our  urlLink ebay sales .

      Well we finally had to put  Lupita la Trailera  to rest. After much love and abuse, my old 1996 Ford Taurus has gone on. Now we have a brand new '04 Toyota Rav4! Woo hoo! Fierce! We picked her up in Milwaukee on Saturday morning.       So we went to see  urlLink moenia  last night @ the House of Blues here in Chicago. Great show. They gave a really cool show. We had a blast. But the best part was the opening act. La Quinta Cuadra, a local rock/pop band from Chicago. Never heard them before...but the lead singer. My God was he hot! He comes out and we're like "oooh he's hot". Then we all look down and see the biggest package! Lol! Nice booty too :) You know we'll all be @ their next show.

          With all the Madonna/ebay excitement I forgot to mention that this past Monday my pacakge from Spain arrived! Fangoria's new album is mine! I love it! Much better than their last  Naturaleza muerta  (and I really really liked that one). The bonus DVD is wicked w/ artists interpretations of their videos. It's part of a project that was done w/ the Museum of Contemporary Art in Spain. So I am in seventh heaven right now. Back to hawking crap on ebay...

So if you'd like to, please visit our  urlLink "WE NEED MADONNA TICKETS" ebay sale  and help our cause.

      the following is part of our ode to claudiabla (aka claudia, aka la hielera). claudia is a dear friend who is always going out of her way for everyone. so we decided to throw her a surprise bday. the big surprise was her bday is in dec. (around xmas) so basically she gets screwed every year. so a fake 4th of july bash was planned. it was a blast. claudia was so surprised! so i have to share some moments w/ u all.        first in typical joe fashion, we kidnapped her and made her wear this hideous dress! the theme of the night was her quinceañera (she never had one, plus she's expecting...hence the  immaculate conception ). so here she is being escorted by her court :)     praying to la virgen de nacaragua (claudia is from nicaragua and sometimes we call her naca when drunk...lol). check out how hard she's praying!        there was a "baile del CONDON" set to chayanne's  tiempo de vals . we did our best to make sure it was a taqui-taqui naco quinceañera.        there were musical numbers. here is the first one, by yours truly. as many of you know, whenever you attend a quinceañera u always get entertained w/ tacky choreographed routines. so we decided to do our own take. an impromtu drag show! here i am entertaining the crowd to  quiero ser santa  by alaska y dinarama. had to stick w/ the religious theme.       i don't think you've been to a tacky quinceañera that didn't play timbiriche's hit song. here gigi (aka freestlye sister), juanjoderlola and i do our take on  quinceañera        not to be outdone, and in honor of his bday just days before, ryan busted out the skates and did his award winning routine to olivia newton-john's disco hit  xanadu  inspired by the movie of the same name.  so again it was a drunken filled evening, w/ lots of dancing, drinking, and what not. enjoy everyone!

          the last time i saw madonna live i was 10 years old and it was for the  Who's That Girl  tour. once upon a time i used to be a mega madonna fan. so last wed., july 14 we got to see madame m herself @ the united center. she sold out 4 nights, fyi. anyhoo let me just say it was a great show, we had good seats (thank u ebay). there were some lowpoints though, mainly her caberet take on  deeper and deeper  (i couldn't help but think, geez, didn't kylie do this back in '98 on her  intimate and live  tour?), the snoozy material that required her to sit down and play the guitar and the corny cover of  Imagine . otherwise it was retro madonna all night long!  express yourself, vogue, hanky panky, burning up, like a prayer, holiday, crazy for you  and my fave of the night,  papa don't preach !!! btw i did not take the pic above (i stole it from a madonna site...sorry!).

      You are probably wondering what the hell SayHey! is? It is a  urlLink Kylie Minogue message forum  based in the UK and it's my life! I'm not even that big of a Kylie fan anymore, I've since discovered her younger/prettier/more talented sister Dannii, but I post on this board almost every day in their  Off-Topic  section. They know everything there! Check it out. It's catty fun. This past weekend my good sayhey! pal  AmericanDevil  (aka Dale) was in town. So we (me, Rob and Eddie) met up w/ him and had a blast. Too bad they had to leave after awhile, but that didn't stop us from getting trashed. Roscoe's was a blast as they played: Holly Valance "State Of Mind", Anastacia "Left Outside Alone", Dannii Minogue "I Begin To Spin Around" & "All I Wanna Do" & Paulina Rubio "Sexual Lover". We were screaming at the top of our lungs! I even drunk dialed, something I hadn't done in a long time. Sorry Freddy. "Freddy's a slutt...Freddy's a slutt...". Lol. Here are the pics:       Also tomorrow is the infamous Madonna concert :) Can't wait. Have to post some pics from  La Virgen de Nacaragua's  Quinceañera. Also congrats to my good friends Mara and José Ramón on the birth of their new son, Daniel Mateo. (#4! Ya compren un tele!!!).

      So this past fourth of July weekend I went to see  Farenheit 9/11 . What a great documentary! There isn't much more that I can say that's already been said, but it really makes you see how f*cked up this country really is. Can't wait til we vote Bush out of office. If you haven't seen this yet, do yourself a favor. It will change the way you see the US and our so-called leaders.

      Ok that sounds bad, but really it's not. I am whoring my graphic design skills. I just did this flyer for my cousin Chuy's fraternity's event later this month @ Rain in Milwaukee. So I thought I'd share the final results w/ you all. But seriously, I am available to do stuff like this, flyers, logos, etc. So if you are interested we can talk fees, etc. by emailing me,  urlLink clic_design@sbcglobal.com . Below are the final results, plus I figure it's some good publicity for Chuy and his brothers:
