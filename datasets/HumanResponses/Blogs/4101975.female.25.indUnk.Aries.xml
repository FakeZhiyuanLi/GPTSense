       To expand a little on my previous thought.           I spend about 95% of my free time alone.      I am engaged to my childrens father. This is the 3rd time we are engaged.    He wanted to elope, but I feel I deserve a wedding after all that I've been through. We live in different places. I, with the children at my parents house, and him with his mother and family.        His mother had a kidney transplant in December. I understand that he wants to be there for her. But my children and I suffer greatly.  He never comes around. When he does, she (or his sister) calls and he leaves.        Sometimes I think she exaggerates her pain (maybe I sound a little selfish) or maybe exaggerate isn't what I mean. I think she tolerates her pain until she wants attention. I feel bad for her because she suffers alot. But at the same time. I never get to see my "fiance" , my kids never get to see their father.     There is a house down the street from her. And the people want around $700    monthly for a 3 bedroom house.  He decided (without me even seeing it) that it wasn't good enough because the house is blue, fiends (drug addicts)   lived   there, and the kitchen is yellow. He can't see taking us from where we are now to move there.        He lives in a 3 bedroom house with about 6 people and a dog. I live in a big 4 bedroom house with my parents, and I am cramped. My son doesn't like to stay here because he thinks my parents don't like him.  My daughter has to stay upstairs with me, because they yell about the house being dirty. She doesn't like it there much either. But he doesn's see moving us from here, because of a freakin yellow kitchen.       I haven't been able to sleep or really eat since he told me this last night.  If anyone can give me a honest opinion on what's really good, I'd really appreciate it.

       Picture my life.      I picture my life, the epitome of happiness.    A dream, a house, a car.   A yard, Two kids, a puppy.    A happy life with my husband.    A distance to travel to see family.       But instead, Picture my life.    A nightmare, anger, sorrow, frustration   A yard at my parents house,    One children cries, another wishing for love.   A disappointment after another with a commitment phobic.   Parents downstair, yelling and screaming.      Picture my life.
