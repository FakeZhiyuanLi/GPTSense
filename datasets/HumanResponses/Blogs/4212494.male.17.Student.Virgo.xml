        That's right, it's that time of the year again!!           Those of you who have known me for a long time know that I am a flaming retard.  I'm such a retard, that half the stuff I say makes no sense whatsoever.  ...........................  Wait, that's not my point.  You ALSO should know that, every summer, I go to my Dad's house for a week.  Guess what?  I'm going to my Dad's for a week!!  On the week of my Birthday, too....Well, at least I go there knowing that pickles everywhere will fall into trash cans!!           So, my next entry won't be until...maybe two Mondays from now.  I know how much you'll all miss me ^^ ......I expect cool birthday gifts!  MAKE IT SNAPPY!!  *snaps fingers*  XD          RFQD:     *at Burger King*      JoVo:   This is my friend, Mike.      Burger King Employee:   Mmm.      JoVo:   *to Mike* She's a bit primative.      Burger King Employee:   *chuckles*  You funny!

        Yes, I do, in fact, realize I haven't updated in a while.  I blame it on violent television programming.  Think I should sue?  Yes, I realize Sue's a name >_<>         Aaanyway, my life has reached its all-time high!!  BOOYA!!  Not really, though.  The days I didn't update were...average.  I finally finished painting my friend's porch!  Woohoo!          I learned a valuable lesson today.  Cats cannot use lotion.  If you try to make them, they bite you.  *nods*  ^^          Baibai!!  *waves*          RFQD:      Jamie:   WHEN THE GARBAGE MONKEY THROWS YOU INTO A RADIOACTIVE MUFFIN, DON'T COME BARKING TO A DECAPITATED SALESMAN!!      Me:   ....What the hell are you talking about?!      Jamie:   Oh...sorry...Thought I saw Richard Simmons over there....      Me:   Since when does Richard Simmons have to worry about garbage monkies?      Jamie:   Since I said that last sentence!!      Me:   Oooohhhh....Did you forget your medication?      Jamie:   I kinda left it at home *smiles sweetly*

        Yes, I'm on for my second weekend update! HOLY CRAP!! Well, once again, I really have nothing to say. This weekend was kinda uneventful for me. Gaia's FINALLY back up, which means I can resume not having a life ^^....Lazy bastards UNITE!! *holds up WonderLazyBastards ring* Form of.....A Lazy Bastard! Shape of....I'm too lazy to type out the rest of this sentence.          Heh, anyway, I pretty much sat around all weekend. I've been playing a new game of mine, .hack//INFECTION. 'Tis a fun game. There's this, like, teardrop thing with a reaaaalllly slooooow voice....Why are you all still here?!          Aaanyway, since my weekend's been kinda uneventful, I really don't have a RFQD for you, either....So, I just took a quote from my new game I found funny ^^          Bleagh!! I have a love song stuck in my head!! >_ _      My Birthday's in....*counts*....8 days! Hooray!! (August 23rd is my birthday...)          RFQD:      Natsumi:  You're giving me this? Well, I don't have anything to give you in return...well, except maybe myself....      Kite:  WHAT?!      Natsumi:  No, I mean....I can help you.     *Natsumi joined your party!!*

        I know what you're thinking!!  "Duuuh, WHO'S blog am I reading again?"  That's what you're thinking, right?  Well, you're a moron, then!  You're SUPPOSED to be thinking "Wait a second...it's Saturday, Shawn's never online Saturday!!  How is he posting in his blog?"  Well, the answer, my friends, is simple.  My mom's out at some fair today, while I'm not.  Hooray.  So, I took the time to go online.  Do I have a life yet?          Yep.  Well, nothing exciting really happened today.  Last night I went to a friend's house, but it was nothing special.  Well, there was the hot, hot, man sex....I'm kidding.  Well, as far as you all know, anyway.  *cue X-Files music*          Aaanyway, yeah.  I guess I'm done for today.  Here's hoping my life gets more exciting soon!  XD          RFQD:      Me:   So, did you ask her out yet?  I mean, everyone knows you like her except her...      Martin:   Umm...Well, no.      Me:   Why don't you?  I mean, of course, she could say "No, I hate you, you're a fecking moron," then she could kick you into a vat of orange pudding, then you can eat it all, and say "Yum!".  Then, well....It would be a much happier experience than you figured.      Martin:   *hands me a helmet*  Put this back on and go play in traffic again, mmkay?

        Gaia, for some odd reason, is down today (at least on my comp), so I'm doing my third official blog entry! Hyah!!          Wow, I said "official"....I feel all cool and professional now....          I'm on AIM right now, talking to some friends....my real thoughts lie in random areas, though, as usual...Today, my thoughts are: "That ugly girl with the big lips - Forgot her name - Is a happy-go-lucky teenager in the movie '13 Going on 30', but she's a stripper in 'Catch Me if You Can'. What the hell is up with that? Stripper-Gone-Teenage-Shopping-Freak?!"          Aaanyway, you've heard my random thought of the day. Now all there is to do is dance!! *break dances*          I might post a new entry tonight, maybe not. Depends how bored I get, and if there gets to be anything exciting to write about. I guess I'm done for now. OH!! But I'm gonna put up random funny quotes I've heard prior to typing entries, so, if you want a shout-out here, just say something worthy of Funny Quote of the Day, mmkay? ^^          Random Funny Quote of the Day (RFQD):      Me:  Why are we here? I think people are starting to think we're lovers or something...      Chris R.:  Oh, but we are! *growls sexy-like* I went to town in your pants last night...It was a great town...The mayor was really friendly....      Me:   Let me guess, the mayor was shaped like a penis?      Chris R.:   He was shaped like a popcorn kernal.      Me:  There's popcorn in my pants?! Good, I'm starving!!      Chris R.:  No, not popcorn! I'm saying you have hemroids!!      Me:  Oh....OOOHHH!!!

        Well, here's that first Diary-type entry, about a day earlier than I said....Yepper. I didn't do that much today.          I'm in an RP at Gaia Online, a Yu Yu Hakusho RP, as Elder Toguro. I was there most of the day, but I did help my friend paint his porches (he has 3) for a few hours. Well, actually, he painted...I put Primer on the wood surfaces. It was quite boring, sitting there putting on a few coats of primer with nobody to talk to....But anyway, after that I went to Gaia. Yep.          Today was kinda weird in one aspect, though.....A 12-year-old friend (a guy) of my 14-year-old sister (a girl...I think) confessed his love to me today @_@.....It was a little weird. Well, I'm out. Bai, all! Whatchu talkin' 'bout, everyone!!

        Well, I have a new blog, courtesy of my friend Nrick, who showed me here...I think I'll just use this as an online diary-type thing for friends to read, in case they want to stalk me....kidding ^^     Erm...lessee...about me....Okay, got it.  Most people who are reading this prolly know me at least a little bit, but I'm a random idiot who likes anime.  And video games.  And porn--I mean--What?!  My favorite show is Yu Yu Hakusho.  My favorite video game is Final Fantasy IX.  I spend a lot of time on AOL Instant Messager (My SN is FalconFlame16), and on Gaia Online (I have quite a few SNs there, for my own privacy...yes, I'm paranoid).  Now, obviously, some of you out there know more about me than others do.  Keep your mouths shut, hmm?     Well, I think I'm done for today.  I'll use this as a Diary online, just because I know you're all dying to know what random stupid things go through my head...My first "Diary" entry will be tomorrow.  Thought I'd introduce myself today.  Well, baibai!!
