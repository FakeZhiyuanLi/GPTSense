      i just watched the clip, of point of interest, and omg.. i loved ittt.. i had heard of this nicole character from my fellow CI fans. but i never thought it would this good. i had been meaning to know this nicole character, how she screws around with bobby's head.. i hadn't seen this episode or any other episodes with nicole... but anti-thesis... ohhh my, it even shook my chians up a little. how they kept on going back and forth.. and as if VDO couldn't get better at the whole character actor. and it was amazing. i need to see the whole episode. and then i have a clip of cherry red. and jones. some of my favourite episodes... hehehe..  you just got to love him.. and the show of course. and the show. when is the second season coming out.. so sad, i need a fix.. grrrrrr

      Old Guy: "You're awfully snoopy."  Eames: "A lot of people point that out."  Goren: "Baby, baby, baby! You have no idea how this feels. I mean, I could tell you, but not in mixed company. You have no idea."   Eames:*walks in on Carver and Goren* "You two having a playdate?"  - from 'Cherry Red'  i remember that episode as if it were yesterday.. i love the part where bobby is in the car and he doesn't want to get out.. hehehe if i could love him anymore, god hate to think what would happen. but seriously, you have to love bobby goren and his head tilting ways. hes just so, like i would just want to murder someone to be in the room with him. and i am not obsessed. like there are people who are worse off than i am, and that scares me. but i am happy, during the summer, i need to have a VDO marathon.. if you are a fan, you know that you know you have to have that bobby fix, or VDO fix, depending. but rumours are floating that the third season is coming out in september.. and they are not releasing the second season.. this upset my beyond words... I WANT THE SECOND SEASON.. mofos the bunch of them. we are all druggies, and the stupid law and order pimps won't give us our fix. i smell a mutany on our hands here...  i will just leave you with a picutre.. so you can stare as long as you want

      do you ever have that someone is watching you. yes i am paranoid. but seriously. maybe because i am on my laptop in the middle of the room with my earphones blarring, not noticing when people walk by, but only feel the air woosh by as they past. which also causes some confusion when it comes to this draft that is flowing by.   but everytime.. i swear someone's eyes are fixed on my computer screen. (i have a laptop for school, part of this laptop program) and anyways, its mine, but it isn't. sometimes i wonder if they have some sort of spy ware on my computer, where the track all the sites i have gone to, and everything i have read. its like when you are at work, on a computer, you know someone is watching you or recording you actions but you can't see them.   i swear, someone is watching me.. taking down every single twitch, or stretch. its all being recorded. and i will be judged on my actions.

      lake of dead languages. good book. anyways, the teacher kept a diary at her boarding school during her high school years. later some kids get a hold of it and re-inact the passages. after, one of the students asks her why would you keep such incriminating evidence in your diary.  i am paranoid, and the fact is that the more i write, the more i disclose, and the more if someone was to read this, i would have one heaping woop ass, or just maybe an expultion from school, or maybe put in a psychiatric hospital. i may over exaggerate at times, but i am paranoid. if i started to see and talk to people, i would be suffering from schizophrenia paranoia. but sersiouly, why would you put incriminating evidence on the internet or on paper. when i get murdered, i really don't want the police rumaging through my notes on the internet and drawing their own conclusions. just right there when i said i was going to be murdered. if they read that, they might think that someone was after me.   i know there are thousands of millions people on the internet and probably on this site, but the chances of someone i know readin this. they might not know it was me, but if i described an event over the internet, someone might catch on to my drift. it makes me even scared of the murderer behind my door. they are all out to get me.   i am the dark shadow at the foot of your bed

      ah, the good old internet journal. for the sake of collecting things, i know have three blogs, one the server is always down, the other just for friends, and now this one, because no one knows me here, i can feel free to say about anything i need or want to. the comforts of being anonymous. i like my walls just fine, with my back up against a wall i can see what is coming at me from all angles, and therefore no suprises.  what else can I say, i think i am becoming more and more random. you probably knew someone in high school, who were stupid and thats why they were funny. they would say random things, that would make no sense, and everyone would laugh. oh that such a ____, type of thing to do. today during class, i was really bored, and unable to say this in some sense, or put my words together so that others could understand, i told my friend, beside me, i felt like running circles. does that make sense? in my head it did. well at least to the drunken hampstr in my head. like normal people, i might have an owl in my head, or kat (its still in the process), fit a cheetah in her head. but no, im have to live with a drunken hampster that resembles the gerbil from joe cartoons. i don't know how that came to be. they share many similarities. becoming more random that i realized, after the fact, that i had drawn an evil mushroom. why in the hell would i draw a giant mushroom? seriously, my condition is getting worse. next thing you know i will be in a corner in the fetal position, saying over and over, the rabid sri lankan sand dune bunnies are coming for me (sorry if i offended an people from sir lanka, its an inside joke, go read 'running in the family' and then see how much you want to be eaten by rabid sri lankan sand dune bunnies after that).. that by the way was on my one million things i would rather be doing than reading running in the family or in english class, it was second to being eaten alive by head-hunting tree skunks (one of the more vicous animals on our planet). i should be studying for math trig unit test. but i did my 1 and half hour of studying. i'll study some more tommorrow. im happy right now listening to my dmb.    i am the giant mushroom that keeps you awake at night.

      Sometimes I feel like I'm falling Fall back again, fall back again, Fall back again, fall back again  Oh, life it seems a struggle between What we see, what we do I'm not going to change my ways Just to please you, or appease you Inside a crowd, five billion proud Willing to punch it out Right, wrong, weak, strong Ashes to ashes, all fall down Look around about this roundabout This merry-go-round and round If at all God's gaze upon us falls It's with a mischievous grin, look at him   Forget about the reasons and The treasons we are seeking Forget about the notion that Our emotions can be kept at bay Forget about being guilty, We are innocent instead For soon we will all find our lives swept away  Look at me in my fancy car And my bank account Oh, how I wish I could take it all down Into my grave, I'd save and save Take a look again, take a look again, Take a look again at things you have collected In the end it all ties up so tall To one big nothing, one big nothing at all  Forget about the reasons and The treasons we are seeking Forget about the notion that our emotions can be Swept away, kept at bay Forget about being guilty, we are innocent instead For soon we will all find our lives swept away  You seek up an emotion And your cup is overflowing You seek up an emotion, Sometimes your well is dry You're looking for a monster For him to fight your wars for you But when he finds his way to you, The devil's not going to hide, hi..hide  Say, say   Late at night with TV's hungry child His belly swells Oh, for a price of a coke or a smoke I could keep alive those hungry eyes Take a look again, take a look again Every day things change, but basically they stay the same  Forget about the reasons and The treasons we are seeking Forget about the notion that our emotions can be Swept away, kept at bay Forget about being guilty, we are innocent instead For soon we will all find our lives swept away  You seek up an emotion And our cup is overflowing You seek up an emotion, Sometimes your well is dry You seek up a big monster For him to fight your wars for you But when he finds his way to you, The devil's not going to hide, hi..hide  Fall back again, fall back again Fall back again, fall back again

      music: money, pink floyd mood: i'll tell you when i know for sure  i kept on forgetting about this blog/journal of ideas and thoughts. and i finally came back to it. i have been busy though, you know. one of those lives that are caught up in the events. yes i really don't think that made sense or held any truth to be certain. right now, im in a psychodelic trance of some sort. (i think its the music), funny because i didn't even live in that era nor was i born in the 60s or 70s. i'd like to state for the record i was born in the crap music decade. with all that shit pop. i'd take out my shotgun and start a head count of people in the 80s i would shoot point blank. yes and i still haven't found my alibi for the death of my teacher. i am still working on that. if there are any takers? i usually am upfront with people, and i am very blunt. and because of this, people are often taken back when i tell them that i am looking for someone to lie on the stand when they say that i was talking to them, or with them during the murder of someone. i envoke my 5th. enough of that.. im going to start to really throw some people off.   i think i just listened to the shortest dmb song ever, the song that jane likes.. its only 3 minutes.. wow, i thought it would go on a bit longer, usually im listening for about 6+ minutes.. hmmm well thats interesting. i went to see dave. yes i did. he was great as usual. i think i need to see dave more often. well if it wasn't for my uptight parents. yes it took much convincing just to let me out of the front door, never mind letting me go see dave. it was hard work, but everything paid off in the end. yes sir. you bet you pants. you can say that again. okie dokie. swell.  i forgot that the next day starts at 12am. that was a stupid moment if i ever had one. and here im thinking that it isn't tommorrow until i go to bed around 2ish am.   maybe the weirdest and scariest song of all dave history: halloween. you can just picture a fat dave in a pink bunny costume, cigar in mouth, answering the door, with a perverted smirk, when the children are going door-to-door asking for candy. proof:  Why do you run around here Why do you come inside of me Why does it rip me out in dream Why then why then watch this little fuck  Hey little dreamer’s eyes open and staring over me Oh little lonely eyes open and radiant  Wait until I come and I will steal you Wait until I come I’ll take your soul Wait until I come and I will steal you Wait until I come and I will go  I’ve been dreamin in the night Shadows on the windows Lead oh and everyone go Well leave me on the night I wonder you lying?  I will not relinquish light  Oh little dreamer eyes open and raving here  Wait until I come and see you little girl When we come I’ll leave with you too When we come I’ll let you come low  Hey we’ll leave it all behind Oh and then the nightmares I’ll fill them in good time Oh they will seat your mind When the light hits And you maybe’ll ask me  Why do you run around here Why do you come inside of me Why does it rip me out in dream Why then why then watch this little fuck  Going away  Why this lonely Why this lonely Why this lonely love  Why this lonely Why this lonely Why this lonely love  Halloween Carry on Bury all Bury all Bury all Bury all Bury all  And in this dream Tell us are you satisfied with fucking Oh walk away Don’t walk away Don’t walk away Don’t walk away I’m talking to you  Love is hell Love is hell Love is hell Love this I’ll tame you  Love Love Love Love this not me here  Love Love Love Love him up to you  if thats not enough for you. go listen to the gorge CD. i was scared for my life. but the energy that this song produces. its like a weird balancing act. where in one hand you are shitting yourself, and the other you are having the time of you life. go figure.. go listen for yourself.
