       Background of the E-dispuut  The name "Edispuut" is built around the word "EDI" and the Dutch word "dispuut". The closest English translation of the latter is "dispute" or "debate", which reflects one of the basic principles of Edispuut: to discuss and coordinate research interests relating to Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), Electronic Commerce (EC) and interorganizational information systems.  All Edispuut members are PhD students or academic researchers from several Dutch universities or research institutes, i.e., Delft University of Technology, Eindhoven University of Technology, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Free University of Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam, Twente University, University of Groningen, Telematica Instituut, and Tilburg University. They stem from different disciplines: information technology, organization theory, marketing, logistics, sociology, systems development, work organization, economics, information management, computer science and business administration.   Objectives of Edispuut   The objectives of Edispuut are: to exchange expertise and research insights from various disciplines by organizing regular meetings and conferences to establish a network of EDI and EC-researchers, both national and international; to communicate research results through participation in international conferences and lectures; to disclose research results to the science and business community. Through reaching these objectives we try to contribute to the (inter-)national discussion about E-commerce.   The E-dispuut Blog   The E-dispuut Blog is the online platform for communication for the E-dispuut members. Announcements concerning new E-dispuut sessions are put on the blog, an archive of presentations is available and other relevant information for information system researchers can be published on this blog.

       About Edispuut meetings  An Edispuut meeting consists of several presentations of Edispuut members or related researchers, who discuss their current research activities. Through discussion and 'dispute' each speaker hopefully gets useful hints and feedback to improve his or her research. Often a meeting also includes other activities such as a demonstration, methodological discussions or a presentation of current projects of the hosting university or institute. The Edispuut is notorious for its never-ending and fierce discussions. After a meeting the members continue their discussions having drinks and diner.   About the Organization of an Edispuut Meeting  The organization of Edispuut meetings is randomly assigned to a yellow member of a participating university or research institute. The selected university or research institute takes care of the e-mail invitation (send an invitation 4 weeks in advance to our members at  urlLink members@edispuut.net ), the accommodation,the lunch, the speakers, presentation support (e.g. projector or beamer) and the meeting schedule. A commonly used meeting schedule is:  12:30 -13:00 lunch 13:00 - 14:00 speaker A 14:00 -14:15 short break 14:15 -15:15 speaker B 15:15 - 15:30 short break 15:30 - 16:30 speaker C 16:30-16:45 remaining questions, Edispuut update,arrangement of new meeting data and appoint organizer.  Speakers might be: our members, other academic researchers, supervisors or researchers from business.

      Herewith I would like to inform you about the upcoming PREBEM conference (see  urlLink www.prebem.nl ): the 8th PhD Conference on Business Economics, Management and Organization Science. Which will be held on Wednesday, January 26, 2005 in Amersfoort, The Netherlands.  PREBEM stands for PhD Researchers in Business Economics & Management, and is a part of the NOBEM (see  www.nobem.nl ). The NOBEM is known to many, through the PhD courses they provide. Almost all the universities that participate in NOBEM have a delegate in the PREBEM; I am the person representing the EUR.  The PREBEM conference is a perfect opportunity to meet with other PhD researchers from The Netherlands, working on similar topics at other universities in The Netherlands. It therefore is a perfect opportunity for networking.   Details about the conference can be found in the attached Call-for-Papers.  The PREBEM website ( www.prebem.nl ) provides you all the details of the CFP, and some extra information. We will keep it up-to-date over time, and therefore we would like to refer you to the website the all details.   We would like to encourage everyone to submit an abstract, and to present a paper at the PREBEM 2005 conference, although it is also possible to attend the conference without having a paper or poster presentation.  For more information, contact  urlLink Hans Moonen
