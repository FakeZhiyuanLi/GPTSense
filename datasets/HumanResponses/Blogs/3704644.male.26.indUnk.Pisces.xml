       urlLink Petals of the Roses   I figured this out in 6 tries... Today I feel like a genius... It won't last...  When I worked at an ice cream factory for a summer, we never could see what the weather was outside.  So it was rare to be all "oh sigh, i want to be outside in the warm weather". Now I work in a office, on the 17th floor, and I can see the river valley below, and I so wanna be out there... damn capitalism and western society and the demands it puts on me to work a 40 hour work week.  Man I could so enjoy either biking for hours this afternoon, or sitting around drinking a few kokanee golds.

      So Day 2 of having a Gmail account... I already feel elite and above the rest of my fellow geeks here in the office... so many people want them, so few have them.  I have a list of people waiting to invite, but alas, no invites have been given to me to hand out yet, so they are all S.O.L.  So until then, I can taunt them and act all-powerful!  If your ever in need of more hard drive space, remember, pr0n can take up alot of room!

      So today I spent the morning trying to get a Gmail account.... a couple begging posts on  urlLink Fazed.net , then pressing F5 over and over and over on  urlLink Gmail Machine .  Had to get the random number of 1337 to get an invite, closest I got was 1338.. sigh...  but luckily a nice Fazer hooked me up.  Now just a matter of waiting for the account to be active.... wonder if I can press F5 over and over on that.

      Why is it I can walk into a Used Car place, dressed normally in jeans, a t-shirt, and runners, and no one will come talk to me at all.  I don't mind being invisible sometimes, but when I wanna try a car out, its not very handy...   I hate them all so very much.... they either figure your poor and ignore you, or harass you until you want to take their pen and pin their hand to their desk and walk away.  Or maybe just take their business card and proceed to give them nasty paper cuts!!!

      So yesterday I accepted a job with the City of Edmonton, and gave noticed at my current tech support job.  Was a happy/sad occasion.  Been here 3.5 years now, so its a rather significant portion of my life.    Since starting here I've done quite a bit, in my life... -Got addicted to Asherons Call -Discovered "Chicken for Lunch" and Mt Fuji -Gained like 20 lbs -Started Mountain Biking, and got quite knowledgeable at it -Started working out, dropped like 50 lbs -Broke my addiction to Asherons Call  And at work... -Ended up supporting nearly everything we make/sell here -Got lots of extra responsibilities -Moved up to level 2 -"dated" a crazy pyscho girl who works here (dated is in quotes since it was under 2 weeks, and it took 3 days to dump her ass) -Never got fired  So its definitely the end of an Era for me.  New era should be pretty dang good I figure.. and if not, well... thats gonna suck ass...  So now, until I start the new job in early august, I get to feel happy i'm going to be done with support for now/a long time/ever, and sad i'm leaving a secure job with good people, but happy I'm gonna make more money and have a more interesting position, but stressed cuz not as secure as a job.. silly life, why so many foibles
