      Oh, I forgot...  Pete cleaned the living room so I don't have to worry :)  The wine stain came out, which is a bonus!

      Back from shopping and the gym.  I spent $250 on groceries and had a so-so workout.  The good thing is that I don't have to pay for groceries for a while now...thank god.  I think I'll start doing more cardio in my workouts so that I drop some muscle size and get a little more cut.  So far I'm happy with my progress, but I'm getting a little bulky in the legs as they're twice as strong as the rest of me.  Mmmmm the bitches are making me dinner :) The best part about being a horrible cook is that the guys refuse to let me help them.  I'm happy doing dishes afterward anyhow because sometimes when other people do them they don't take enough care to rinse them.  I'm soooo hungry!  I hope food'll be ready soon.  Tonight Kali is coming over so there might be a little fun to be had.  I really should get my own party crew together so I don't have to wait for other people.  That's the thing I miss most about dating somebody - there's always something to do when I have someone else who gets amused as easily as I do.  I wish Nathan were home tonight.

       I'm feeling much better today   Well, last night was pretty fun.  I decided to smarten up soon after the previous entry because otherwise I'd just ruin the evening for everybody.  Went to QP, checked everybody out and found they are all pretty good-looking people with the same good fashion sense.  I'm pretty lucky to be going to a school like this.  Anyhow, it was fun and I got drunk for free 'cause Pete kept buying me drinks :)  Paul was bored with us though, and just kinda stood around for the whole time.  After I'd had enough of everyone I suggested he and I leave for home and pick up some smokes on the way - yeah, smoking is bad, but I only have one when I drink every so often.  So we went home and smoked a bit, but Paul is so incredibly NOT talkative that it's irritating.  I don't mind silence because you can communicate with it just as well as with words, but I literally have to say ridiculous things just to get him to talk.  Well I hope today goes well.  The house is going out food shopping because we literally have only bread and condiments to eat.  I hope we go to Loblaws because I need the pharmacy there for a buncha stuff and I also need to get some cage litter for the Dirty Bird.  Then I think I'm gonna clean the living room because nobody else will and I guess I ought to because the wine stain on the carpet is mine...

       Today I feel ultra-pissy.   Here is my new blog!  Well, I decided this might be a good idea.  Dunno why, but it seemed like a more interesting thing to do than go to my volunteer meeting today... Plus,  urlLink Kelly  has one and it looks like fun :)  So, today I managed not to do anything, for once this week.  I needed a rest; this week I began and finished a series of prints, got an IUD put in (no worries for 5 years!!!!!!) and managed to bitch my housemates out at least once for every two things I said to them.  I also yelled about the 3rd years in Studio and their work habits (mainly that they sometimes aren't as clean as they should be...usually I'm OK with it because I know they don't know any better) and the best part of that was the thing I was yelling about was something that a 4th year in the room had actually done.  Yeah, I felt pretty bad.  Probably worse than the guy who made the mess did.  I'm so hormonal now that it's ridiculous.  I'm glad I'm off the Pill, 'cause I was never very excited to be on it in the first place, but seriously I'm tired of being the PMS queen already.  The worst part is that I know I'm being a bitch and it disgusts me so much I bitch even more.  It's a vicious cycle.  Hopefully this is over soon.    In other news, I'm still feeling sorry for myself over men.  The main problem with me is that the guys I'm not too crazy about always fall madly in love with me and the ones I truly want have no further interest in me besides friendship.  I suppose it's my fault for choosing to pursue people like that but I just can't understand why fantastic people wouldn't be fantastic enough to give me a chance, because god knows I've given enough people enough chances.  The karmic chances I had maybe all got used up in my past relationships.  Maybe this is all part of the bitch situation, who knows.  Sometimes I wish I was normal or boring because then people wouldn't just want to fuck me.  I'd actually have a chance to enjoy someone's experience of seeing past all my acts and appearances.  As it stands I see that heterosexual men will always have only one of three reactions to me: instant lust and indifference to me as a sentient being, or a mythological obsession with the height of the pedestal on which they see me, or 'let's just be friends'.  Get real, guys.  I'm only as special as the next person, just in different, really different ways.  All I want is honesty and true love.  How is that so difficult to elicit in those I love myself?  Aside from that, I can't complain!  School is great; my profs are really impressed with my work, so that's good.  I'm so proud of myself :)  Family's working out well and my bro just broke up with his girlfriend so maybe I can watch the Super Bowl at his place...that'd be fun.  We don't have a TV at my place so I have to mooch from other people when I need to catch a show!  My bet is on the Panthers, but only because their mascot is a cat.  I heard the Patriots will win.  Well, I should stop writing.  I need to get other shit done......  Tonight, drinking at the QP with the usual painful crowd.  I'l probably make an ass of myself and hit on Paul again *lol* I really am learning too slowly to keep my mouth shut and stop wearing my heart on my sleeve.  "Bartender please fill my glass for me with the wine you gave Jesus that set him free after three days in the ground....Bartender you see the wine that's drinking me came from the vine that strung Judas from the Devil's tree with roots deep deep in the ground." -DMB  urlLink

       Today I'm pissed off.  Surprise.   So, I got more flak today for being in fine art.  Pete told me that although his history degree is worth only shit, mine is worth worse than shit and I'll never be better off than starving...reinforced by Paul's "I'm not gonna be a part of this conversation" and the silence of everyone else in the room.  Sorry if I have ambition.  It's people like him that will cause me to go far if only to prove them wrong... I mean, since high school I've made such a change in myself for the better and I know already I'm moving up.  Excuse me, but fuck you all if you think I can't be much more than you expect and then some.  I am so sick and tired of people trying to keep me down because of who I am, what I believe in and my plans for the future.     I got a date on Wednesday with a guy I don't even know.  This should be interesting.  I hope he's not a creep, but knowing my luck he'll probably suck like all the rest of you.  Or maybe...he'll have lots of money.  He'll marry me for my looks only and I can just lay back and sleep through the rest of my life while I squeeze out kids, hanging around passively while he has zillions of affairs, getting fat and grey while I pine for the life I could have made for myself, and I'll eventually amount to absolutely nothing - just the way you always expected.  Eat my ass.  Every last one of you.

       Today I feel so optimistic.   Woke up at 9 after a really good sleep.  It's sunny and warm out again :)  Last night it was pretty hot in the house so I walked around all night in my bra LOL and told the guys that having one's shirt off is underrated.  Oh man I can't wait to wear shorts and sandals and sundresses again!    So that's the background to my good day that I intend to have today...  I had breakfast with Pete, then he left and I had coffee and spoke of the new Passion movie with Paul.  I think I'll watch it, since I think my artistic education will make it more interesting to see.  I mainly know Catholicism through iconography and such, so we'll see if there's any correlation between what I know visually and what sMelly "that's not a typo" Gibson has to offer.  I have a docent meeting today and I'm not dreading it because I finally know the tour in French and English.  I hope it passes quickly because I want to go to the gym for a long while...I had a binge last night and need to work it off.  Ugh. How's this for weird - I ate, in this order: some blueberry dumplings and the leftover dough, a large chunk of marble cheese, 1/2 a white hamburger bun, some italian flavoured breadcrumbs, some mustard pickles, a baked chicken breast, 6 chicken thighs and some peanut butter cookies.  Sick eh?  I thought so.  That's a lot of fucking gross carbs there... Today I've eaten breakfast and that's all I'm having.  Seriously, I feel soooo gross.   Tonight I'm going out with the Queen's LBs and Erin (and maybe her guy).  I dunno if I really want to but I also want to dance...if Nathan gets too drunk I'll just ditch him and hang out with just Erin.  Dancing rules :)   This is such a lovely poem.   Love at First Sight  They are sure that a sudden feeling united them. Beautiful is such certainty, but uncertainty more beautiful.  They think, that as they didn’t know each other earlier, nothing ever happened between them. But what would they say: those streets, stairways, and corridors where they could have been passing each other for a long time?  I would like to ask them, don’t you remember ---  maybe face to face once in a revolving door? an “excuse me” in a tight crowd? a “wrong number” heard over the phone? ---but I know their answer. No, they don’t remember.  They would be quite surprised, that for a long time chance had been toying with them.  Not altogether ready to turn into their fate, it would draw them together, pull them apart, cut them off on their path, and, swallowing a giggle, leap to the side.   There were signs, signals, so what they were unreadable. Maybe three years ago or last Tuesday some leaf flew from arm to arm? Something got lost and then got picked up. Who knows whether it wasn’t even a ball in some childhood thicket?  There were doorknobs and door bells, where touch lay on touch beforehand. Suitcases next to one another in the baggage check. Maybe one night the same dream, blurred upon awakening.  Every beginning, after all, is nothing but a sequel, and the book of events is always open in the middle.  -Wislawa Szymborska

       I am soooooo tired and cranky.  Yeah, that time of the month is coming around again.   I had a lame day today.  Got up to meet Otis for a print review today and he said he wasn't available because of a meeting.  I could have slept in until much later!  I need to do laundry because my bedsheets are ancient and I'm embarrassed to have people come in here and smell them...  I fucked up a print badly today; it was my best of the series.    At least I hauled ass to the gym and ran for 1/2 hour.  I paid my module fees at Studio today too so I won't be reported to the Dean :)  So, the things that really matter got taken care of.  Also, I just showered and shaved - it's amazing what that can do for my mood LOL.  So anyway, here is a conversation I had with my siblings yesterday.

       Today I feel like getting lots of work done.   The weekend was good.  Went out with Shane on Saturday, to Tango and Aj's.  I made it clear I wasn't interested, but we ended up kissing for a bit before I sent him home LOL...  Oh man.  Alcohol makes me ultra-horny.  But anyway, he's really good so why not?  Kissing isn't a big deal.  It's not like I didn't tell him right off the bat I wasn't going to sleep with him.  Shane says he's still hopeful about our having a relationship but I really don't want to be any more than friends.  He's a good guy, but 2 major things:  he's shorter than I am and he broke up my last relationship.  The first thing is ultra-shallow and superficial, but hey, I like tall guys, what can I say?  The second compensates for my shallowness.  I really don't ever think I can forgive Shane for temporarily distracting me from Nick and causing the problems that ultimately led to our breakup.  However, he's a FANTASTIC artist.  I'm in awe of what he can do without any training whatsoever.  There are aspects of that friendship that are mutually beneficial and I don't want to give them up; I am his connection to the art world and he is my connection to the Hub workforce.  I think we both appreciate what we can do for each other and are too smart to get outta each other's lives ;)  In other news, the guys are all home :)  I'm not lonely anymore!  Having everyone home again is good, but I hate the mess that's already accumulated in every main room.  Oh well, I guess it's a small price to pay for people from whom I can mooch lots of attention again.  Life is good!  Today is the first day of the last term of my undergrad.  I cannot believe it's over.  Holy fuck it went by fast...  But lots of exciting things are gonna happen soon: formal, my final shows, grad, and let's not forget SPRING and SUMMER!  Wohooo :)  Warm weather is comin'!  And the hormones are too.  Back with a vengeance...Paul keeps bugging me about my peeling the labels of my beer bottles - it's a sign of sexual frustration apparently.  Anyhow, why should he care?  He's not gonna get any LOL!  Nathan comes home tomorrow, speaking of getting some.  I really think that since there is so much resistance from everybody else I'm interested in I will give him another chance.  I mean, he called from BC twice and Oregon twice in the week he was gone.  And I must mention that one of those times was at the wedding where he was Best Man, in the 10 minutes after the ceremony and before he left for the reception!  NO joke.  So, anyone who'd do stuff like that obviously is worth my time, seeing as he feels I'm worth doing that for.  I'll see though.  Everyone deserves someone who will treat them like they need, even if they know how crazy and fucked up they are.  Heh, I'm kidding myself if I think this is the end of my man problems LOL...  But at least I'll be happy.  So I barely got anything done this week...at least anything quantifiable.  I have a bit of printing to do in the next few days, finishing up my image of Paul so I can move on with my life.  I also ought to get my presentation done for Renaissance and do some stuff for the Women's project too.  Blah....lots of work, but it's my fault I didn't do it over Reading Week.  Still, I had a really good time alone and am refreshed and ready to rock the last term :)  Finally............I CANNOT WAIT to see my newest corset.  I think about it often and am excited about wearing it to Formal.  I still have to get Jon's mom to make me a skirt...but if it comes to it I'll have it done in Kingston.  I'll post a pic of it eventually.  Off to Studio!

       Today I feel really good.   I love blogsurfing :)  I just spent an hour reading a bunch of blogs from India.  It's cool how Hindi is sprinkled around in there, kinda like the way French Canadians use their English (except of course it's French that's used instead of Hindi LOL).  That kind of speaking makes so much sense; I know a few languages well enough, and sometimes the best word is in another language.  Too bad most people wouldn't get what I'm saying if I spoke that way.  I want to go to India one time and I don't think I'll want to come back.  I got some work in Studio done today; not a whole lot due to technical difficulties and my needing to remix a lot of my colours.  I have 3 of about 15 layers done...hopefully I can finish tomorrow.    So much for my essay...  My new goal is just to write up the presentation and then leave it at that.  I'll work on it tomorrow, or not, depending on whether I feel like going into Studio or staying at home.  Cameron came home today, with FOOD!  There's so much in the house now that I dunno what to eat.  At least I have company now :)

      Also, I fucking hate when people say they'll call and they don't.  Or that they'll message and they don't.  Especially when I'm ridiculously bored with only a Cosmo or The Other Bible to keep me company.  Seriously, there's only so much I can take before I get sick of swinging back and forth from vapidity to intellectuality.  Is that a word?  Please you fuckers, come back online like you said you would because I CAN'T SLEEP AND I'M BORED.

       Today I'm not feeling much.   OK, I'm eating peanut butter out of the jar.  I need to be shot LOL!  I got a lot of stuff done today.  Most of my research for my Titian essay is done and I ran for 25 minutes at the gym before my usual weightlifting routine.  My pecs are getting bigger and this is a good thing - I need cleavage!  My ass will be getting bigger if I don't stop it with this peanut butter...but it's sooo tasty!  Talked to Nathan today; he met my Dad yesterday, alone.  Brave guy.  My Dad was picking up the wedding gift for Alex and Erin and Nathan was gonna pick it up from him.  Anyway, it went well and Nathan won't be showing up to the wedding empty-handed as I feared.  I'm jealous that I'll be missing the wedding (how many times have I said that already?) but I guess I can't do anything about it now.  I hope they like the Sid Dickens blocks I gave them.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, look here:  urlLink Sid Dickens  and I got them T19, T109 and T113.  Nathan is splitting the cost with me.  I figured bridal registries are for people who don't know what to buy.  I think these blocks are so classy, and the best part is Erin and Alex can collect them now :)    I don't hate men so much anymore.  At least not today.  I think it's partly to do with the fact that I am tired of hating them...  I only hate particular ones now.  No names, since some of them at least will probably see this blog at some point or another, and they may be surprised to see their names here.  Mainly I just hate certain aspects about guys.  Like what's with the idea that it's OK to willingly hang out with a girl who's crazy about you when you know you're leading her on?  Fuck that.  I guess it's for the attention, but if you're not interested or at least using the person you should tell them.  Paul was griping about that to me earlier and I was so close to saying "OK so you're gonna do what you did with me, right?  Women aren't for playing with."  It's so abrasive how he acts like he can't control how he affects women, but I have the same effect on guys and I'm damn good at telling them I'm not interested.  Paul is incredibly ambiguous, so much so that it took me almost half a year to realize he's not interested.  He never outright said NO.  Ever.  I think deeply and unconsciously he really likes tormenting women in this way.  It sure was a waste of my time.  Not like he MADE me do anything; it was all my doing, but if it wasn't for my fantasy about being with him I'd have gone to PEI this Christmas, to Oregon this week and I'd be happily dating Nathan.  I have so many doubts about anything to do with men now because part of me still clings to the fact that he NEVER SAID NO.  But the real issue is: do I want to be with a guy like that?  NOT FUCKING LIKELY!  So, I guess I have my answer.  Too bad for him.  He's gonna miss out on the chance to be with a lot of very special women besides me if he keeps this up.  That's always been the best part about Nathan; he has known from the very first time we went out that I was taking advantage of him, and he told me the same about him.  I mean, come on, when you pick up a girl on the rebound she's gonna give you what you want, be it sex or whatever.  He never minded because it was a mutually beneficial, no-strings-attached (sort of) fling that kinda ended up being a little bit serious and anyway, we're doing fine now and there's no hard feelings.  I think I'll give him another chance soon though, because I know nothing's gonna happen with the guys I was hoping for.  And he's always been in the back of my mind anyway.  I'll ask my sister and Erin about it later and see what they think.  My family and friends have never been wrong, as much as I liked them to be.  I'm so worried I'll make the wrong decision and then something better will come along and I'll hate myself.  I really could do much worse though.   Fucking hell I hate trying to sort out my man problems.   I'm very very lucky though, because at least mine are the I-have-lots-to-choose-from troubles, not the men-treat-me-like-shit kind or the I-have-nobody-interested kind.  I'm very sorry if I seem ungrateful.  It's just that I my life is so positive and successful right now that I'm ready for the right man to just fall into my lap like everything else has.

       Feels good to be in a clean house again!   The guys are gone for Reading week and life is lonely but good.  I formatted and repartitioned my hard drive yesterday and in between stages of computer repair I cleaned the house :)  Oh man I was living in a hovel...  However I left the windows open too long and Mango got a chill.  I hope he gets better soon.  Today I went shopping and I don't even want to tally how much I spent!  It's been ages (almost half a year) since I went clothes shopping and I needed to update my stuff - new plain t-shirts and sweaters so I can get rid of my ratty ones, and a leather kilt...yeah...  I couldn't resist.  Anyway, I bought some DVDs too, so I'm glad I can at least entertain myself this week.  It would have been lovely to go to Erin and Alex's wedding, but I think it's better this way.  I'll get ahead of the game before the end-of-term craziness starts.  UGh I think I'm getting a migraine.  I can't see very well so I'm cutting this short.

       Valentine's Day is depressing.   I got a whole series done from start to finish today in Studio!  I am the QUEEN.  The only problem was I was in moiree hell - every layer came out with a crazy moiree on it that I didn't want.  It's so obvious that it looks like I did it on purpose...so I'm gonna say I did :)  Other than that, I'm all alone now :(  And it's Valentine's day.  My first one without a date since I was 14!  I'll see if I can find something fun to do though.

       I'm feeling uninspired.   Last night was OK as far as fun goes.  It was only Fine Art people who really came to Elixir.  Cameron showed up but went off with friends shortly after.  I had been hoping to bring out the usual crowd but I guess since they'd been out the night before they weren't into it.  I heard they played euchre instead...I dunno how to play; guess that's my problem though, not theirs.    Jay's voice is getting better but he still sounds like a doorhinge.  His stage presence has improved as well.  He went batshit on his vocals with a diffusion pedal and it was putting me to sleep :)  Doesn't help that I was still hungover and sleepy, either.  I got this spectacular idea to remix one of their songs though; it would be perfect...I need to learn how to do that though, and what kind of software would be good.  I heard Fruityloops was OK, but I need guarantees I can set up a house track that's gonna be good.  Everyone's leaving for the week now.  Too damn bad I'll be staying here >:(  At least I can clean the house and enjoy the silence for a while.  I have a lot of work to get done as well, so if I get a headstart that'll be good.    I've been thinking a lot:   Baby's black balloon makes her fly I almost fell into that hole in your life And you're not thinking 'bout tomorrow Cuz you were the same as me But on your knees  A thousand other boys could never reach you How could I have been the one? I saw the world spin beneath you And scatter like ice from the spoon that was your womb  Comin' down the world turned over And angels fall without you there And I go on as you get colder Or are you someone's prayer?  You know the lies they always told you And the love you never knew What's the things they never showed you That swallow the light from the sun inside your room, yeah  Comin' down the world turned over And angels fall without you there And I go on as you get colder Always someone there  And there's no time left for losin' When you stand they fall, yeah  Comin' down the world turned over And angels fall without you there And I go on as you get colder All because I'm Comin' down the years turn over And angels fall without you there And I'll go on and I'll lead you home and All because I'm All because I'm And I'll become What you became to me    ...because sometimes songs say it better.  I'll read this later and remember to understand it.

       I am moderately hung over.  And it's raining men.   This blog is like a bad friend: I trust it and tell it absolutely everything, then it goes off and blabs it all to everyone.  So someone heard me up there.  I had a fantastic night!  The Rosicrucianism thing didn't happen; too bad, but I drank with Pete, Kali and Paul for bit instead.  They fully invaded my pesonal space by looking at my porn, art that I modelled nude for, and trying to get to my blog to read shit (it's really my fault I do those things and normally I don't care...it's just the way they went about looking at it that got me).  That's why some info and posts have changed...it was too explicit!  Now I don't care who reads this thing.  It's already caused me enough trouble so I'm keeping it cleaner and less in-depth from now on.  Then I beat up Pete.  He used to be able to kick my ass but now I'm stronger.  Then we went to Gusto.  I recommend the Tartini.  Mmmmm Chambord!  Afterward, we went to Mybar and that was fun.  My house represented at foos...I am the BEST on D when I'm drunk.  Then Tyler and I played pool; I represented at that too.  Oh man I was on fire.  Anyway, we talked for the whole time about my man problems, which he doesn't understand because according to him I'm 'perfect'.  Tyler's not so bad himself; he's pretty much my ideal.  Anyhow he said he'd had the hots for me since 1st year...ditto; vice versa.  Fuck I'm an idiot.  I should have just gone for him like I wanted to and ignored Pete.  Anyhow, what does it matter, because he's taken.  Fuck, Pete, why did you keep us from getting together?  Arrrgh.  Anyway, he walked me home and we had a good chat about art.  I've never seen anything he's done - what a shame.  I'll have to take him up on that.  Maybe....oh nevermind.   In other news, tonight is the BSC fundraiser and I'll be drinking again.  Maybe I can make it 2 awesome nights in a row?  We'll see.  I like the way things are going right now.  Except for Lavalife.  I wish I was getting any mail at all.

       Today is Pete's birthday and I'm excited.   I hate Windows ME.  What they don't tell you is that ME is short for MEdiocre or MEmory leak.  My computer is seriously fucked up.  As soon as I am able I will switch over to Linux.  I also hate Lavalife.  It's too tough to get what I want even if I ask for it  and  seek it out.  Thankfully I don't hate Studio, or the work I'm doing, or even that I have to stay home for Reading Week to do some research and print.  Lots of stuff will get done with minimal interruptions.  Hopefully Stephanie will come out here for her birthday though.  Neither do I hate the fact that I'll be going to an ultra-interesting talk on Rosicrucianism tonight before going out with people to celebrate with Pete.    Please oh please if someone or God or whatever can hear me, PLEASE let this be a good night.  No overdrinking, hitting on Paul or anyone else for that matter and no saying things that get me into trouble.  Just let me have a lovely night of 4th year normalcy and toss in a bit of fun and flirting for good measure.  I really, really need this.

       Today I feel functional again!   Well I got a buncha stuff done today.  All the research for my Tuesday presentation is done, and my WMNS 225 essay is also done.  I need to focus on Studio tomorrow, then the presentation handout and the French tour, then that's it for this week.  Huzzah!  In other news, I'll be in Ontario for the break :(  I was hoping to go to Vancouver but oh well...  I got  my #1 not-prof choice at Cezanne's last night!  All the professional work I wanted was taken before my number was called, but fortunately the best amateur stuff was still available.  I'm lucky :)  Other than that, life is pretty normal right now.  Today I found out I'll be getting a skirt made to go with my corset soon, c/o Jon's mom, who will probably do it for free, apparently.  My only cost will be the fabric.  Lucky me again!  I can't wait to see the corset though.  It's the better choice of the two I wanted, and I thought it was the worse.  However, I checked the photos against each other and the boning on mine is more elaborate, which is what I hoped for.  Yep.  Now if only I were lucky enough to have been the winner of this week's Super 7 lottery...

       Today I feel kinda tired, but optimistic.   Yesterday was a pretty big waste of time.  I could have learned the basics of a new language with the amount of time I wasted!  I figured it out by calculating the time it took me to learn each of Spanish and Italian and since I wasted 15 hours yesterday that amounts to over 5 weeks of classes.  Anyway, I can't do that this weekend because I have too much shit to do.  So I'm going to Cezannes.  I'm sooo glad!  Dressing up and schmoozing rules, especially since the work I submitted is stuff I'm proud of.  Hopefully it goes quickly, and my ticket gets called quickly too :)  I'm looking forward to going with Nathan too.  That should be fun.  Now all I need is an idea of what to wear - a feminine suit or my fun crazy dress?  Or something completely different?  Oh the trials of being a woman.  Hmmm, so I think I better cut down on the bitchiness factor.  The quiz I took that told me I'm bitchier than 96% of women really put things into perspective...hahaha yeah right, I like being a bitch so I'm not gonna stop.  Everyone who matters knows I'm not actually such a nasty person and if they think otherwise then I guess they don't matter as much as I thought they did!  The docent meeting today should be interesting.  I'm not a bleeding whale this week so the crankiness factor is waaaay down.  I need a little more practice on the tour, and I need to memorize key phrases but that's pretty much all.  French is something I never should have let go the ability to use.

      Still no Studio...but I did score a ticket to Cezanne's!  Yessssss :)  Now I can get a piece of art.  More quizzes, but only because I've done some work today.   ARTIST (Dominant Introvert Abstract Feeler ) Victoria  Like just 4% of the population you are an ARTIST (DIAF)--creative, adventurous, and deep. Although you are an introvert, your dominant ideas lead you to assert yourself often--especially through your work. You actively put your creativity to constructive use, and because you are ruled by your heart you are less likely to be inhibited by logic.   You have an intuitive understanding of emotion and know how evoke it in others, but the real world can be a prison of foolishness and embarrassment if you don't get your head out of the clouds a little more. Also, you are 87% likely to write poetry. Please, for the love of God, stop now.    The most common personality type is the Guru (SEAF). The rarest is the Businessman (DECT). Only 3% of all test takers fall into that category.    Now that's fucking cool.     Congrats! In your life, you'll have sex with 22 people! Including the 9 you've already had sex with,  that makes 13 new lovers! You are 49% sexy.   The info on your 13 future sex partner(s):  0 of them will be female   13 of them will be male   And you will actually love 2 of them!   As you get older, your tastes will change drastically.     And the last one, before I go to the gym and pick up my Cezanne's ticket...   66% bitch! which is higher than the worldwide average 38%   How others compare:   0% (same as you)    4% (bitchier than you)    96% (less bitchy than you)    This wasted afternoon is brought to you by thespark.com

      I don't feel like going to Studio today so I'm gonna mess around with....quizzes!  Here we go.    -Raspberry Swirl- You're "Raspberry Swirl" from the "From The Choirgirl Hotel" album. You're full of odd talk and metaphors about sex. You also bash men just a little bit. "If you want inside her, well, boy you better make her Rapberry swirl".

You like to play tricks on people who aren't quite as bright or clever as you - which is almost everyone. Nature is the setting you prefer to be in - Always. Barefoot and wild you can't be tamed. You're probably a restless spirit who loves to travel, and quite a dreamer. Your creativity is astounding and your art (of whatever media - from writing to painting to drama) is like something from another world - ethereal and often very fantasy-oriented. You can either be a social butterfly or a loner with their head in the clouds - but rarely inbetween. You stubbornly refuse to accept responsibility or to give in to the wishes of others - unless you feel like it. You have a strong passion for music and can't imagine life without it. You'll grow up someday, but you'll always be a child at heart. You are adventurous and love to take risks, and feel a deep connection with the weather, plants, and animals. You prefer sunshine to thunder or snow, the warmth of summer to autumn's chill, and quiet forests to suburban backyards. Magic through and through, you are far more powerful than you seem, and are capable of being extremely passionate.

       Today I am very very cold   I want it to be spring NOW.  I heard a cardinal on Monday (so, too, did Nick, interestingly enough) so that means it'll come soon, groundhog or no.  Of COURSE he's gonna see his shadow if it's sunny out...that's how it was on Monday.    Today I ordered my corset!!!  Yay!  The measurements were easy to do myself.  I wish I hadn't waited so long to do them, but I'm still in time to get it before Formal.  Unfortunately it looks like I'll be going alone to that, but oh well.  I still have to get Stephanie to talk to Jon's mom to see if she'll make me a skirt to go with it.  I can't afford to pay a ton for a skirt I'll wear a few times as opposed to a corset I know I won't be able to take off.  Probably I should figure that out soon.  Maybe go to Fabricland and check out some heavy silk.  Blah.  Must remember to get Brodie's present soon.  OK, doing that as I type :)  Lately I've been fascinated with all the Catholic blogs out there.  I wish I had something like that sometimes, you know, a community to grow in spritually.  Some of the things I read are lovely.  I take back some of the things I said the other day about religion - it's not ALL bad.  The sense of community is very strong and I approve very much.  I just don't like all the close-mindedness that goes along with it.  And I hope to god that nobody's PRAYING for me.  Ughhh.  That happens too much in the Catholic blogs and I always feel like it's a condescending thing when it's towards non-Catholics.  It's like the moment an independent group forms, it becomes an exclusive thing.  I always feel left out when people talk about religion, partly because I don't share their particular beliefs and partly because I guess I give off an anti-religious vibe people misinterpret as intolerance.  Surely most Catholics are wonderful people but the ones I have known have to a degree always been a bit fearful of treading in different waters.  I scare them all, I think, and it's not like I'm a crazy devil worshipper, or even a naked pagan or something...Although it still bothers me a lot when people mess with my collection of stones and candles in my room.    Anyway, I'm more spiritual than most people and yet I'm still an outsider.  I'm open and honest about anything anyone wants to talk about, but as soon as the exclusive shit starts up, I get irritated because I firmly believe that we are all part of the same creation and that if the person (in this case myself) is inherently and motivated to be good, why fuss about it?  It's interesting to find out differences between my peers and embrace/celebrate them but I guess we all don't see eye to eye on that.  Many of the people I meet are still asleep anyway - I wonder if this grouping mentality reinforces this?  It's probably a good thing that I don't associate myself with any physical group of people, because I'd probably, unfortunately, be treating some people the way I'm complaining about.  Being alone is better, even though it hurts a little more.  At least when I hurt I can tell I'm alive and awake.  Safety and protection in numbers is for the weak.  Hey, I just thought of something: maybe I'm excluding everyone from ME, and not from any particular group, because I exist in my mind as something separate unto myself.  Whatever.  I'm overanalysing again.  OK, just got Brodie's present.  The funny thing is, it involves Cthulhu >:)  Poor Catholic friends, I wonder what you think of me?  I hope I can get it to him somehow...

       Today I'm feeling uninspired and reluctant   Well, Nathan called me yesterday and asked me to come to campus to eat dinner at the JDUC.  After arriving and discovering we had only 2 minutes to get food, he said "I have money at home" I was like, "That's nice, do you want a cookie or something? It's not doing you any good here" and realized that he was asking me to come out to a place that wasn't even open and asking me to pay for him.  Wow.  If I wanted to experience that last night I would have just hung out with Pete *lol*...anyway, I was a little pissed but that got sorted out quickly.  I went to the gym yesterday and holy crap was it busy!  I ended up just doing two exercises and rowing for 5 and running for 10.  I'm gonna start rowing more because the ergs are never busy and it'll give me the workouts where I need them the most.  I'll be trying a longer stint on the ergs today.  We'll see how it goes :)  Ugh I have to go to the 4th year show meeting today...I don't really know what to do about my section of people because we've never gotten together and I can't really call the Scherzo to reserve the date until  I figure out exactly what we need to do for it.  I'll do that today and call tonight.  I haven't done shit all for Studio in the past few days.  Gotta get busy.  I must remember to get measured for my corset tonight.

       I feel pretty good today.   Man, I love remembering music from the good ol' days...I remembered Better Than Ezra's "King of New Orleans" in class today and I'm listening to it now :)  Kazaa rules.  It's snowing like crazy too.  I didn't want to stay on campus anymore so I came home to get some work done instead...which hasn't happened yet but I'll get on that soon.  We had crits today in Studio and mine went quite well; I'm happy with where my work is going and it's easy to see where I need to improve.  I have to get the base drawings done tonight, then I can go on to the easy stuff.  Nathan came over last night and oh man did I need that piece!  I've been OK for the past weeks but something's been missing...yeah, ASS was it.  Good ass. It's always better when I wait, but I hate waiting because it makes me crazy.  I feel much better now.  The problem with sex is that I should have never had it, really.  Nick always said you never miss what you never experienced and he was right.  So I regret ever having become sexually active, seeing as I don't get it as often as I need.    I suppose I missed out the more important part: I had a really good day talking to Nathan as well.  He's pretty interested in everything I have to say, which helps when I'm lonely and want to talk about stuff.  I need to get back on track with the Christian apocrypha I started reading in December.  I like that stuff so much I can't shut up about it when I start... At least it would give me a better idea of where I sit regarding religious ANYTHING seeing as I'm so sick of the institution and everything it has done to make life harder for humankind.  So anyway I went on a rant about that to Nathan, who is completely non-spritual and anti-religious from what I gather.  At least he's open-minded and tolerant of my ultra-weird ideas.  In a long roundabout way, that's me saying I got my conversation fix yesterday as well :)  Sex and conversation.  YEaaaahhh.  Did I mention we talked for 6 hours?  Whoops, forgot that part.  My voice is sore today.  Well, off to get some work done.  Yeah, I'll do it, I promise.

       Today is a good day...I feel like getting lots of stuff done.   I woke up at 8:15 today, which is surprising because I was awake until 3 or something trying to get my brain to shut the hell up.  So far I've found all the pics I need for the next 2 weeks of print portraits...I found a cute one of Pete and Kali so I'm gonna do one of them both instead of just Pete.  The one of Paul is good but not exactly what I had in mind.  The one of Cameron is perfect and I got a pretty good one of Nathan too.  All I need now is a pic of Erin and I should be set for the next couple of weeks.  I think I want to do one more of myself but I'm not sure what I want to show.  That'll be one of the last ones anyway so I won't worry about it now.  I think I'll also do one of me and Thomas and Stephanie, and one of me and the guys.  I dunno yet.  I want to have 10 of these or so for the final show and I'm almost there.  Maybe I'll do a celebrity or something.  Like Ashton Kutcher..mmmm.  That's not really my style though.  I have to go downtown soon.  My watches all need batteries or links taken out, and I need stuff like a flexible tape measure and some shit from Shopper's.  I hate this cold so much and would rather shave off my corneas than walk longer than 15 minutes outside...  Oh joy, another Women's class tonight.  I wonder if I'll get dumb again and go talk to Nick some more.  Really though, it's only out of pure desperation for a good chat that I talk to him at all.  There's really nobody I love talking to more, even though I think it takes all our willpower NOT to start fights every time.  Man, what I wouldn't give for a consistent source of meaningful and enlightening conversation.  It's possible I'm getting dumber and less eloquent in my speech habits because of my deprivation in the last 6 months.  It makes sense: I swear ALL the time and embarrass myself with silly and awkward comments too often.  Well, it can only get better from here, now that I know what I want.  Plus, this blog is helping, although it doesn't talk back.......which is sometimes a good thing ;)

      OK, I am the shittiest programmer ever.  Not only can I not stay up past midnight or stand the taste of caffeinated cola but I have no idea how to fix the friggin' text in my sidebar.  Nick would be so embarrassed for me hehehehe... I managed to set it up alright but other than that I'm soooo frustrated with trying to fix the text size.  When I have time tomorrow I'm looking up a basic tutorial because I've had enough of drowning in code I sort of understand.  Many, many apologies!  Goodnight.

      Well, the Patriots won.  I slept all afternoon so I could stay up and watch it without passing out.  Good game; uneventful first half, then we all got to see Janet Jackson's breast c/o Justin Timberlake, then the second half was awesome.  I love football, even when my team doesn't win.  In other news, I had the most fucked-up dreams today.  I thought the guys came downstairs and shut my door 'cause they were being noisy and it woke me up, then I had this bizarre movie-like romantic dream set in the summer in Huntsville.  Man it was good (nudity, a hot guy, nice weather, and almost-but-not-quite ass) and I guess I had it 'cause I've been pretty lonely in the past little while.  It sucks not having a partner around all the time so I can go nuts over them.  I'm an attention whore and I'm not giving or getting enough!  Anyway, when I woke up I was confused because my door was open - I had dreamed about the door being closed - but I felt much better after having slept.    At least I got my program translated today.  It was a lot easier than I thought it would be...now the only problem is finding the time to memorize it...

       Today I'm not feeling anything in particular.   So I'm doing a really good job of procrastinating right now.  I'm supposed to get some research done, translate a section of my gallery tour and start a new print series.  I really don't feel like doing any of it; the sun is shining and I just want to laze around today.  Plus it's Super Bowl day and I don't have anywhere to watch the game :(  I wonder if they broadcast it online...    Last night was ultra-laid back.  After dinner (which was sooo yummy - sauce by Cameron and BBQ chicken by Pete) I got distracted by Cosmo for a bit until Paul asked if I wanted to skating.  Unfortunately it was closed so we came back home with his friend Kim to have hot chocolate and shoot the shit.  All they talk about is law school, so I can't really join in unless I know the cases they're discussing, which I sometimes do.  I understand though; a lot of the stuff I talk about involves Studio.  Anyway they share the same religion and a lot of the same job experiences, plus they're in the same section in class so it makes for good listening for me, but not much else.  Somehow I don't think they'd appreciate what I have to say, so I keep quiet.  I had a good time though :)  Lavalife and my new blog are taking over my life.  Paul went to bed about 12:30 last night and I stayed up for another hour messing around on Lavalife.  What is it about older men that makes them ignore the fact that I'm 20something to message me and try to chat?  I know some girls are into that but my profile explicitly states that I want nobody older than 26.  That's stretching it, actually, but I figured since I'm wiser and more experienced than many of my peers that I might give older guys a chance.  Anyway, there sure are a lot of weirdos on that system.  I only have met one guy who seems nice enough.  We'll see once we meet IRL though.  I'm looking forward to going on a "first date' just once in my life :)  Well, I understand why I was so fucking irritable the other day.  Aunt Flo is here today.  She'd been on hiatus for 4 months due to that disgusting Minipill...anyway, now I have my IUD and no more fake hormones, which is good.  Best part: no more worrying about getting knocked up due to missed pills.  Life is good!

       I just didn't feel like blogging for a while.  Sorry.  Well, not really.   So.  Let's see what you've all missed...  I went with Erin to the Goat Face Ball on Friday.  It was AWESOME; I attended and drank lots of alcohol for absolute free all night.  There were so many hot guys there my head was spinning...ohhh man.  but I didn't pick up.  Well, I almost did but he was much drunker than I, so it kinda didn't work.    A guy friend of Nathan's comes up to me halfway through the night; as I go to give him the ol' guy-friend shoulder-squeeze and a handshake, he leans in, kisses me on the cheek and tells me I look gorgeous and that he loves my outfit (hair completely loose, light peachy-rose silk dress with spaghetti straps and uneven, layered hemline, with my vintage peach-and-brown lace wrap and matching beaded purse, pointy flesh-tone flat Fluevog mules and chunky abalone necklace...completely different from the modern black-and-bright-colourblock skirt and top sets that most of the girls wore...and let's not forget to mention the 3-inch stilettos in which absolutely none of them could walk properly..........yes I am very catty) seconds after I finish explaining to Erin how lovely and polite Offierski always is.  I say, "I told you so" as Erin and I walk away, but I discovered the following day that he'd broken up with his girlfriend last week and maybe that's why he'd been as forward as he was.  Or, maybe it was just the alcohol.  Or, maybe he's just polite.  I like the attention, regardless.  Anyway, it was a lot of fun and I think Formal will pale in comparison, just because we got fed amazing food at Goat Face and will be fed nada but munchies at Formal.  Goat Face was $35 each for 550 people; Formal is $70 each for 3000 people.  Where the fuck is all that money going?  We also had 3 unbelievable music acts: a cover band, a DJ and a funk band with a turntablist and and MC.  $35.  We were served unlimited amounts of sushi, chocolate-covered strawberries, sliced mango, prosciutto and melon, caesar salad, lasagne, bruschetta, in addition to a bunch of other stuff that I didn't get to eat, but it looked like various other finger-foods and hors-d'oeuvres.  $35!!  We could purchase alcohol of all types, from common shots, beer and mixed drinks to bottles of wine and martinis, then at the afterparty the liquor was ALL FREE.  Again, tix were $35 (!!!!!!!!!!!)but Erin kindly scored me a free pass.  Formal, you had better be worth the $70...or I can just do some easy math and pretend I paid $35 for each event.  In other, not so exciting news, it's finally warm out here.  I wore a tank top today.  It'll be nice for formal and I won't need to worry about a jacket.  Also, I went to the gym and ran for 30 minutes before working only on my legs for another 30 minutes.  I feel good.  This week I will repeat this workout so I feel extra-good (it'll be all psychological...I'll be lucky to see results!) about wearing that tight fishtail skirt on Saturday.  Formal will be officially the first event I've ever attended single.  I think it should be interesting; at least I won't run out of new people to dance with.  No limo or fancy dinner for me though.  I'm driving the Camaro instead and skipping dinner due to my corset, which means I'll be DD.  Corsets aren't good to wear while drinking, so I suppose DD is a good thing to be.  The only problem will be finding decent dance partners in the hordes of single men that I heard will be in attendance.  Offierski is going with the usual group of guys I know.  I can just hang with them if the couples get too obnoxious and lovey-dovey, and I'm sure the boys would all be happy to save me from scary suitors.  I've lectured Nathan a couple times today on his general attitude toward school.  He can get 90s without even trying if he just attends class, hands in complete assignments on time and writes the exams...so why the fuck doesn't he just play the game?  It would be so easy and it's not like he'd have to work any harder than I do.  I'm frustrated because I'm his 'good excuse' to procrastinate.  My brother is clinically depressed and being put on Zoloft.  Fucking shitfaced drug-pushing Queen's Health doctors.  All of them can eat my anus.  Drugs don't do anything...if they did I know certain people who would still be alive to tell you they don't.  He's on academic probation, likely to be kicked out and will probably take that pretty hard.  I hope he'll turn around in time to save himself, because if he gets kicked out my family will stop paying for him to live.

       Last night SUCKED   That's right.  SUCKED.  The whole reason I was part of the Scherzo committee was so that I would have a good reason to stay the whole night, get wasted and have a really good time.  Unfortunately for me, basically all the tasks and titles I was given were useless and eventually absorbed by the two people in charge.  Excuse me, but "Communications With Management" seems a silly title to appoint when both heads are in touch with the manager anyhow...so when I try to call a meeting to organize exactly WHAT I'm going to contact management about I get ignored because one of them has already talked to him.  I love being in charge and helping out, but when people insult my capabilities I just see no point in trying to change their opinion after one or two attempts to do so.    The reason it sucked was because there was really nothing to do; I had let them know many times that I would like to help auction off works but every time I was pretty much ignored, and to make matters worse, there were only 2 auctioneers for 3 rounds.  Doesn't it make sense to have 3?  I dunno.  The committee had been asked to sign up for jobs during the night but I was already too sick of being ignored so I didn't offer to help.  Silly, I know, but I was mad.  Anyway, I pretty much just sat around the whole time, people-watching - which wasn't that interesting EITHER because there weren't enough people there to fill all the seats, and the Scherzo is a small bar.  Yeah, so generally, in my humble opinion, the auction sucked (although we did raise quite a bit of money, the atmosphere blew donkeys and people got the hell outta there as soon as they got their artwork).  I'm really just bitter because I had lots of ideas to help make the auction successful (but was ignored when trying to bring them up) and because I didn't get to be an auctioneer (which would have been SO fun).  I swear to god, if I EVER get any crap about not pulling my fair share of the weight for fundraising I will fucking FLIP.  I'm done now.  The only really good part about last night was that I broke in my corset, and that I had a long conversation about cheating and misandry with Marzenna.  From those two things, I learned two things: one, that I am incredibly histrionic, and two, that I have questionable morals because I hate men.  Cool stuff, yes?  Today I will print enough to make up for lost time.  I heard the others haven't even finished one series yet this semester...too bad.  I'll be done 3 by the end of next week.  And yes, my work IS more important than fundraisers I am excluded from anyway.

       Today is a good day :)   I gave my last presentation of undergrad today.  Finishing the essay and then breaking it down into a presentation was an awesome idea - my talk had a purpose and a clear thesis, unlike the last few I gave which were done before the essay.  With any luck I'll have done really well.  We'll see I guess.  At least the essay's done and all I have left to do is a 6-pager on goths.  No problem LOL  My gicle' print turned out awesome and I hope it sells for a lot at the auction tomorrow.  I've offered to be the third auctioneer, so hopefully I'll get to hog the mic for a while too.  It'll be weird if I have to sell my own piece.  Well, I think I may go solo to the formal this year.  I have a week to make up my mind about this, but basically I have already.  It'll be fun getting to mingle with everyone and stuff.  I'm trying to look on the bright side.  A friend of mine told me today that not many people from our common social circle are going.  Maybe there will be lots of Fine Artsies there.  Hmmm.  No, single will be better.  I'll get lots of dances from lots of guys :)  Fun, fun.  And no obligation to go home with anyone either.  Yeah, single it is, then.  That's pretty much it.  I'm gonna party hard tomorrow night at the Scherzo...  That'll be excellent.  BFA people are the most fun to party with.  I'm rambling, so it's time to go to bed.

       Trying desperately not to write my Titian essay.   So, what can I rant about instead of writing my essay?  This is ridiculous because I'll be typing at the computer anyway so I might as well just work instead...  You know what?  I just convinced myself to just write the damn essay.  I'll update this entry when I feel like I need a break.  BREAK #1  I had to drop 10 off my bench press yesterday because of my shit-ass health.  I feel less butchy, even though I'm still actually doing about 65, which isn't bad.  Considering my goal was 95 for this week, I'm doing poorly...but I'll try for 95 by my birthday.  Rumour has it that one of the linebackers thinks I look like a porn star (???) in my gym outfit so I guess I'm not doing THAT poorly.  Oh, and I have a Nathan update: he told me yesterday that he was unavailable for the weekend because of work, essays and poker.  That's a smart guy, folks!  Fucks up once, gets it right the next time.  At least I got the truth.  Now I can work/drink/possibly get laid by someone new and interesting without worrying whether Nathan will call at 3am wanting me to drive 2 blocks to pick him up.  Anyhow, time to write fun stuff about what the art world now knows about Titian's late style thanks to modern conservation techniques.  I'm at 2 of 15 pages; man, I have a long way to go.............  BREAK #2  Yeah, I took way more breaks today but I didn't spend them blogging.  I'm not a *complete* loser LOL!  So I got to about 5 pages and wanted to shoot myself so I went to the kitchen and ate some lime Tostitos, 1/2 a baked acorn squash and some baby carrots.  I have a really bad habit of eating as an excuse not to work.  After that, I had some green tea to bring up my metabolism and sat around waiting for Nick, our potential new housemate, to show up.  He turned out to be quite a pleasant guy and no sooner was he out the door when we all gave the thumbs-up.  I just have to check once again with my brother to make sure he doesn't want to live here next year...but that's another story for another day.  Paul and I both got a chocolate craving this afternoon so we got some Fudgee-Os and ate them ALL.  His majesty had a craving for Enrique's "Escapar" (yes, the Spanish version, which I must admit is better than the English) so we put it on repeat while we binged...I made up a few new lyrics to go with the cookies, i.e. instead of "Hey, tu y yo" it's now "hey, Fudgee-O" and if you substitute a few 'comer's you get a pretty good song about a Fudgee-O craving.  I'm a genius.  Don't throw roses, just throw money.  After that I got another page written up and then it was time to go to Christine, Marzenna and Emily's reception at the Union, to which Paul also came to keep me company and from staying too long.  It wasn't the best show this year, but certainly it was not the worst.  Then, back home to eat 2 chicken legs and a bunch of cinnamon hearts.  I didn't actually eat that much but I feel fat and sassy anyhow.  Well, back to work.

       I GOT MY CORSET TODAY!   Yes, and it's absolutely incredible.  I'll do business with  urlLink Starkers  again - their work was phenomenal and my waist actually gets smaller without killing the rest of my torso like my other custom work.  Dunno why this is different.  Maybe they actually know what they're doing there LOL!  I'll post a pic as soon as I get one taken.  I have to write a 15-page essay this weekend.  No problem; afterward I have to edit it into a presentation, which is to be done in class on Tuesday.  Hopefully I can get the slides I need for that...I was ultra-stupid and didn't reserve them this week.  Ugghhh.  Anyhow, then my essay'll be done, which is due on April 5 I think, so I won't need to worry about anything but my Studio work and my essay for Women's (which is not a research based one, just a thinkpiece from what I understand).    I also have to remember to write up a French spiel for the mini-tour at the Agnes on the 2nd.  I'll be fine; it's not like it has to be very complicated.  I'm always a little worried 'cause my accent isn't very wonderful (in my opinion) and I don't want anyone turning their noses up at me ;)  Hmmm....  I dunno what else.  We'll see if there's anything interesting to write about tomorrow.

       Happy St. Paddy's!   Well, I've been drinking all day.  And, I had an application for Formal Escort.  Any other takers?  See the post for the 15th.  More later.  XO,  Drunken Me :)

       Merciful sleep.   I slept enough last night, even though I woke up at 1 and then 3, I fell asleep again pretty quickly.  Hopefully this means the worst is over.  NO applications for Formal Escort yet?   Well I guess it hasn't been long...  Nathan has been obnoxious lately.  He has an essay to hand in and it's a week past due - he told me Sunday night he was staying up late to write it and when I called to see how he was doing (at about midnight, because I couldn't sleep and was bored) I was told he wasn't there, which means one of a couple things: he was drinking, smoking or playing poker.  Turns out he may have been doing all 3 but only admitted to poker.  No big deal, I was just calling out of boredom, but I found it a little funny that he wasn't working on the essay he said he'd be up really late finishing.  He said he'd like to watch a movie with me yesterday but when I called him, he said again he'd be working on the essay (same deal: he'd be working all afternoon until dinnertime) and that he'd call at 7pm, so I vegged out until then...I had decided to skip my night class to be with Nathan since I wasn't feeling up to going anyway (it runs from 6-9pm).  I waited until 8, thinking he must be busy writing and I didn't want to disturb him.  Then I called my Mom to chat, just to spend a little longer doing something besides waiting for Nathan to call, especially since he *must* be working hard on the essay - that made me happy to think he'd finally started to get his ass in gear.  9pm rolls around and I decide to call and see what's up, because I'd gotten the usual "I can't wait to see you tonight; I've been thinking of you all day" and was definitely looking forward to hearing from Nathan at 7pm  'cause I was sick and exhausted and a little cranky.  WELL...I call at 9, as I said, and sure enough, I hear the sounds of hold'em in the background.  I asked what was going on and he said he and the boys were playing poker, and I asked for an explanation why he had told me he wanted to see me and that he would call, because he was obviously gonna play poker instead of work on the essay that as you all know is now a week overdue.  Essentially, he lied about wanting to see me (he wanted to be with his housemates), then lied and told me he was gonna work on his essay (when in actuality he was gambling away money he doesn't have).  Now, I'm a reasonable person and I love giving my boyfriends time away with their boys, because I know that within a few days they come running back just crazy from missing me - seriously ladies, tell your man to go away for 2-4 days a week because they LOVE their space and will definitely make the most of your shorter time together.  So I ask why he just didn't say he'd be unavailable for 3 days instead of lying to me about where he was and what he was doing.  80% of my life doesn't involve Nathan and I have a ton of fun things to keep myself occupied and productive.  The problem is I would gladly put those things on hold when I feel less than awesome and I want extra attention...which was what I did last night.  I don't blame him for my own wasting time (I could have been doing lots of things but didn't because I was excited about seeing him), but it *is* his fault that I was misled.  I think he ended up feeling like a huge cad for lying about what he was doing LOL but that's never my intention, I just want HONESTY and when I don't get it, I let the person know why lying (about things that would be perfectly okay with me as long as I'm informed so I don't choose to waste time) is a stupid thing to do.   Anyhow, the upshot is that Nathan felt bad last night, but not bad enough to make it up to me.  We'll see how things go today.  I think I'll just be busy tonight, since I wasted valuable time waiting around (gahhhh NEVER wait for a man...you'll end up old and lonely) when I could have been working on the various thing I need done for Friday.  So I'm a little sick still today, but the cold has localised in my head and neck, so I'll be better soon.  Good thing, too, because tomorrow is St. Paddy's and I'm getting DRUNK :)

       I'm FUCKING tired.   First off, big up to Mr. Sandman...actually, I'd prefer to say a big FUCK YOU instead.  I haven't slept in 3 nights and I don't know why.  I drugged myself with NeoCitran last night and woke up 2 hours later.  So much for that.  I'm taking shots tonight if I don't fall asleep before 10.  I need a job.  Today I wasn't looking forward to updating my resume, but to my surprise and delight, I had updated it already :) :) :)  So, this week, assuming I get enough sleep to look presentable, I'll be taking resumes around.  Hopefully I can get a job at any one of the bars out there...  Someone said I looked like shit today, and I said I was tired, to which they responded "oh, well I heard Mono is going around..." One big problem though: don't you have to be sleeping a lot to have Mono?  I don't think that insomnia is a common symptom.  My throat is tickly and my neck's a bit swollen, but other than that, nothing.  Plus, until this morning I hadn't either of those symptoms.  Anyhow, I seriously doubt I have Mono but I'll get tested for it anyhow if it's still around after Wednesday.  I got my skirt for Formal yesterday!  It looks really good and I already have shoes that match; I just hope it fits well with the corset overtop.  For that reason I didn't remove the tags.    Speaking of Formal, any guys out there wanna be my chaperone?  I hate going to formals without a dance partner/arm candy...  Applications will be accepted in the Comments section below.  Ability and desire to dance all night is imperative, and if you're hot, you get bonus points.  If you're a hot guy who knows how to dance and I know you...you have the upper edge.  But you have to buy your own ticket.  I'm broke.

       HOLY BOOZE ATTACK LAST NIGHT   Yeah, so I haven't updated for a while because I've been sick, and lazy, and drinking.  Sowwy.  I went to Ritual yesterday afternoon at 1pm, and was so drunk by 6 that I puked and passed out.  How embarrassing!  At least I got home before I did.  I was supposed to be at the BFA kegger but as I was too fucked up to get there, I didn't go.  That sucks donkey balls, but oh well.  I seem to remember propositioning a friend of mine for a threesome....eeeeemmmmmmmmm...........yeah.....  I have a BIG mouth and an overactive sex drive to go along with my overactive imagination.  That's the second time I've propositioned an attached man this week.  Not a good thing.    I had an OK day today, because I had a long time to sober up; I've been pretty functional but haven't accomplished much.  I saw Paul's play, Laramie Project, which was good but not worth the $7 I paid to see it.  Although I respect what it was trying to get across, I think it was trying to be a bit more than it actully was, and it would have been fine had it finished at the end of the second act.  Anyway...  I don't have much energy to rant today, but I'll make a mental note to rant about the following things very soon: the dance club last Thursday, little man syndrome, cheating, living with lazy housemates, and guys who lead girls on.  Other than that, I need to get my ass in gear this week, for presentations and essays and prints are gonna be the death of me if I don't get them well under way by next Monday.  Good things in my life right now: the skirt I found to go with my corset for formal, clean bedsheets, my health (I was so sick I couldn't lift my head on Wednesday but the next day I was fine) and Nathan.  I would be dead without that guy.  Seriously.  Bad things in my life right now: the perpetual filth of my house, the painting I need to start and finish before Friday, my absence from the gym for a week, and the way I feel about Paul.

       I'm hung over!   So my date went well.  It was, in fact, the guy I saw at the Brass.  He was a very nice guy, just not at all my type.  Conversation flowed consistently and we found we had many friends in common so I may see him again, but not in a date-type situation.    I got my Paul series done this week and it's so beautiful I was almost in tears when I printed the unifying layer.  Next I'll be doing Pete and Kali.  That one should be really fun, since I'm making it so busy and vibrant.  I ought to post pictures here so you all know what I'm talking about.  I drank like a fish last night!  Tyler and I teamed up to challenge people at pool and LOST MISERABLY 5 times in a row until we finally won the table.  It was a bad night for pool, but a really good night for socializing.  The QP was extra-fun.  I talked with a girl named Erica (I remembered her name!  Yay) about men and cheating for a long while - I'm glad some people have the same opinion about cheating as I do: unless you're married, it's not a wrong thing and simply means there's a need to move to a new relationship.  I believe that if you choose to marry someone, that's basically saying you'd choose them over anyone and thus cheating is so wrong in that situation.  Anyhow...  As we all left there was a guy passed out in the doorway and people were all worried, but he had a regular, strong pulse so I'm sure he was fine.  He'll be hurting more than I am today though!  So yeah, Tyler and I had an ultra-drunken MSN conversation (which I should have saved...) during which I found out I hadn't been obvious enough about hitting on him.  However...now he knows what I think and claimed last night that if I try again tonight I'll get better results.  YEAH.  So my next post may be the best yet!  Stephanie called at 3am to chat and we talked until 5!!!!!!!!  I learned stuff she'd never talk about while sober, such as the number of guys she's slept with, which I am sorry to say is greater than the number I've slept with...and she's 4 years younger.  I'm embarrassed, 'cause I always thought I'd had a lot of sex...but I guess not LOL!  Anyhow, she's gonna come out and live with me for a bit soon, or so she claimed while drunk on the phone.  I'll ask her sober and check if that's still the case.    Anyway, back to bed.  I need to rest up for tonight.

       I'm drunk!   Yep, drunken post.  I was just at the Brass, and I apologize in advance for typos and poor English...  So, I have a date tomorrow.  I think I actually saw the guy at the bar this evening and he doesn't really look like my type...Fuck, I hope it goes OK.  Too bad the guys can't lend me a cellphone or something so I can get an "emergency call" halfway through and leave.  Anyhow, maybe I'm just being superficial as usual and the date will be fine.  Anyhow, I promise to be a good girl in any case.  Other than that, nothing is new except that I have no idea how all my work is gonna get done before the end of the year.    And I still stand by the Ladder Theory 150%.  Sorry boys.  We women are bad, but it's only because you only wanna get in our pants!  XXOO, Drunken Me :)

       I barely slept last night.   I'm tired, and not as pissed-off as yesterday; that's unfortunately only because I am running on only a few hours' sleep and therefore have only enough energy to stay awake without being a bitch.  I have a huge day today too, and can't come home until 9:30 or a bit sooner.  Yeah, and all Paul's harem will be here when I get back, so maybe that'll put me in a better mood.  Or not.    I swear not to have any coffee today or eat anything after noon.  My system needs a hardcore break after this weekend.     And you all need to go to this site NOW  urlLink Ladder Theory  to read about why platonic friendships don't exist.  This site is funny because it's true...although there's a little too much negativity on it, directed to both men and women.  I checked it out and realize I must be one in a million - I am a female Intellectual Whore to a particular guy who is too particular about his women.  Shit city.

       Bored.   OK, so I'm finished university, my show is up (it looks amazing) and I have nothing to do.  This is really weird.  On a good note, sex is better.  I've been having a lot of fun, except my brother is living on my couch in the next room so we have to keep the noise level down.    Tonight we had the BFA grad potluck, which was the biggest waste of time and money ever.  I'm glad I didn't slave over a stove to make something nice, but I regret spending $4 on cookies because nobody touched them.  I should have taken them home with me but then I would eat them - that would be very bad!  Anyway, I thought it would be more of a social and longer-lasting situation than it was and I am ultra disappointed.  Except for the fact that I got to eat more pineapple than I believed was humanly possible, it was a flop in my books.  Hmmm.  I guess I'll post pics of my show when I get around to it.  I still need to post Formal pics of myself and other stuff.

       Relieved.   I finished all my prints for the show yesterday after 10 straight hours of printing with about a 20 minute break for lunch.  Seriously guys, I am a machine.  My work is beautiful and I'm so proud of what I've done.  I'm hoping so hard that I can still show in the old Art Library - the men working there told me they'd be done tomorrow for certain, so I can paint and hang late on Friday night.  I'm going with JR and Sibylle to talk to the department head just in case he may be unclear on the fact that I AM showing in the room if the floor is finished.  It thunderstormed a couple days ago :)  I waited until I saw the front roll in and then went out to get caught in the downpour.  I love the rain so much and was really sick of the snow and cold.  Spring rules.  Nathan writes his last exam today.  These next few days should be interesting.  I'm writing my LSAT in a couple months.  I need a safety net.

       Still disappointed.   I had a really fun birthday last weekend.  Nathan's family had a cake for me and made steak for dinner :)  Then on the 17th we went to Alex and Erin's for shopping (I got a migraine and lost my vision in the mall, but didn't want to worry anyone so I pretended I was fine) and then to the Courtyard for dinner.  Mmmmmm.  The waiter made caesar salad from scratch right at our table...  Then we got home and were going to go out dancing but we stayed up until 4am watching hockey, playing hold 'em (I watched Rounders and learned how to play) and Mariokart 64.  I drank wayyy too much and woke up feeling ultra terrible yesterday.  I wanted to spend the evening with Nathan but alas, it was Sunday and that means the Sopranos, beer, weed, Monopoly and poker night with his house. I forget every week.  He tried to make a coffee date for 8:30 this morning!  Forget it, if he stays up until 3.  Did I mention he has exams in 2 days that he hasn't studied for?  Normally this isn't too big a deal because I do the same thing all the time, but he doesn't go to class either.  To me, it makes sense to get a good night's sleep after Saturday and wake up early today in order to study hard, especially since he got fucked up the ass on his last exam for the same type of procrastination.  I'm beginning to feel like I'm making a huge mistake, because his parents lectured him on the same sort of behaviour related to both work AND school this weekend, which means he's always been like this and will probably never change.  I  REFUSE  to be the sole breadwinner and support a bum.  Nobody says I have to spend my life with Nathan but I'm beginning to feel as though I want to, despite all the shit he keeps piled on top of himself.  The big problem is that I have nobody else who's interested in me.  I can be alone but it sure is lonely - I want a partner.    Also, to top it all off, my libido is dropping from lack of sex and it really sucks.  I'm sure you all really care.  I am aggressive enough to go for it when I want some, but he turns me down almost every time, because it's late in the evening and he's tired.  He gets it when he wants some, but usually it's in the middle of the day or when we need to rush or something, so I get the shitty end of the deal: while he is satisfied, I am not because it takes time for me, not just 5 minutes.  This is a bad situation because I will cheat if this goes on any further.  Stress is a huge part of my life and masturbating gets really monotonous and boring when I could have the real thing if only I timed it just right.  Other than that, I have until Friday to get 2 prints done.  I will start them today.  I'm 23 now!  Hard to believe.

       Angry.   Happiness in relationships never lasts long, does it?  What a waste of time.  My life is such a beautiful success if I cut out all but one of my intimate relationships.  I wish my family and all the men in the world would just disappear.  Erin can stay because she's the only person who hasn't the ability to do shitty things to me.

       Too crazy and busy to blog.  This will be short.   Formal was awesome and I was the star, but for the wrong reasons...people gave me shit for tightlacing.  Fuck them, especially because they were stealing photos of me, hiding their cellphones and cameras at their sides.  They muct have thought I was too *lightheaded* from *making myself look freakish and disgusting* that I wouldn't notice.  Sorry, but I was in a better state of mind than most people there.  Plus, I've been waist training for 5 years and I'm naturally small anyway.  Whatever.  I'll post a pic and you can all tell me what you think.  For what it's worth, I thought I looked hot and sexxxy - and I'll bet you all your firstborn kids that most of the girls there were thinking the exact OPPOSITE of themselves and secretly wishing they had the guts to wear what I was wearing.  I hate this society.    I have a Texas-Sized ego.  I've finished 2 series in a week...both are pretty good :)  I need to do 3 more by the 23rd; 1 more by Friday.  Nathan and I are now officially going out.  I'm happy and so is he.  He came home for Easter and hit it off well with my extended family.  This weekend I'll be visiting Erin and Alex with Nathan in Ottawa for my birthday on Saturday.  I want to leave Friday though so I have an excuse to party for longer.  Nathan has money now so he can afford to take me out (thank God).    P.S. GOOOOOOOO LEAFFFFFFFSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

       I'm off the fast.   I feel pretty good, although it's ultra-weird to eat again, even after about 4 days.  I think it'll be really good when I can do the whole 10 days later this month.  Since I was basically able to get through half the time I think I can do it all no problem.    My sister's boyfriend broke up with her the other day and I spent a lot of yesterday afternoon on the phone with her about it.  I think he still really cares about her but I know also that my sister has a bad habit of chasing him around, so maybe he just wants time alone and doesn't know how else to get her to leave him alone.  Anyway, it'll be good for her because she needs to learn to be independent.  I keep trying to fix the fanlisting section on this page because sometimes all of them show up and most of the time only half do.  I'll work on it later today.  Now, I'm going to eat breakfast, go for a run, shower, go for a tan and then call my prof to figure out what the deal is with my printmaking award.

       I had the weirdest dream last night.   It was supposed to be a nightmare I think, but it was a shitty one so I guess you couldn't call it that.  It played like a movie, as my dreams usually do.  Maybe you could call this one a thriller?  Most of the stuff in it was psychological weirdness.  Anyway, this is how it went:  I'm walking through this suburban area at about 11pm when I see this ton of police cars and black sedans drive by and park within view of a particular house just at the junction of a T-shaped intersection.  Walking closer (pretending there's nothing weird going on because I want to see what the deal is with that house), I get this bizarre vibe to get away fast.  I dunno what's going on in the house, but the basement light is on and outside in the garden is a 4-foot circle of badly disguised blood and guts (probably a dismembered body) buried there.  It looks fresh.  In any case, I freak out and start walking away quickly, hoping nobody notices me.  Of course, they do, but ignore me for the moment and before I get a chance to get away I hear people talking in the house.  I can't understand it because it's some sort of pig-latin code, presumably because they know there's a van with sound-radar equipment driving around and they don't want to give themselves away any further.  Then the dream jumps to this alternate reality where I'm dicovering the house again (same time of night) but it's because the black sedans are following me and I'm trying to get away.  Same thing happens: I hear some people talking and see the poorly-disguised grave.  I get away quickly.  There are a bunch of people around in a school playground nearby - I guess it's some sort of party.  They have sparklers and there are children playing.  I manage to hide from the people chasing me, then I go home.  When I get home there's a bunch of weird shit going down and my family is confused because the telephone and the power have been shut off  (my fault?).  I go to bed but I'm bothered by what I saw that evening so I stay up all night.  My family can't sleep either because they're creeped out.  The dream changes realities once again and I find myself passing the house, same deal as before, but as I walk towards it I see two guys about my age sneaking past the cars.  One of them is a guy I know pretty well (in the dream only because I don't actually know any such person) I hear them talking a bit about how they're sure they're gonna be found out, so they begin acting like they were returning from a bar and are extremely drunk.  Perhaps it would be an alibi if they were caught, they say.  Anyhow the cops watch them go into the house and don't do anything.    The following day I am contacted by the police.  I don't give them any good info so they leave me alone.  I call the guy I know and ask what's going on.  He comes in a van with his friends to pick me up and drives me to the house.  Inside it's just a normal house, and the 6 other people are nice to me.  They don't explain at all what's going on but we become friends and I hang out there all day and into the night, when shit starts to go down.  The FBI and some cops force their way into the house and kill 2 of the guys.  The others manage to kill the cops and agents and we pass out because we're tired.  I end up on the floor near the dining table so I can hide if I need to...When I wake up I discover I've been sleeping between the dead guy on the floor and the dead guy on the table and I have a shitload of blood on me.  For some reason I'm not overly grossed out.  We all get out of the house and begin driving around in this big van, but the cops pull us over and start doing un-cop-like things to us.  The other girl of the group and I get to watch the other 3 guys get tortured and this is where it gets gory.    One of the guys is taken out of the van and we don't hear anything from him until we see his body, naked and with the torso and head wrapped in plastic-wrap (I guess they suffocated him in 2 ways by constricting his ribcage and covering his head with it), get thrown into the busy street, and cars just run over him like they don't see him.  The other girl flips out (I guess he's her boyfriend) and to upset her further one of the cops wipes the corpse with her hand (yes it's a woman cop) and licks off the gore.    While we were focussed on the guy in the street they harnessed the other guys to the rear foldout seat of the van and we drive away.  The rear doors have to be slightly ajar to accomodate their legs and feet.  By accident, because of poor driving, the back seat gets bumped out of its locked position and throws the guys out the back of the van, where (you guessed it) they get hit numerous times by cars.  The head agents get angry with the driver and we have to go back for them because they're still alive.  We go back and have to deal with their broken bodies which look incredibly gross.  For some reason they let me go and I go back to the house.  I find another person there who sort of explains but nothing interesting comes of it.  The I wake up.  Yeah it was kind of a boring dream.  Sorry 'bout that :)  Anyway, I break my fast today.  More on that tomorrow.

       Fanlistings are unbelievably addictive.   I slept 5 hours last night and I'm wide awake.  Must be another effect of detox LOL...  I'm now on Day 4 of the Master Cleanser and I feel way better than I did yesterday.  After I'm done blogging I'll go get a tan, then come back and upload the rest of my Fanlisting images.  Good thing I have lots of time to take it easy because I think if I had a job at this point I'd feel pressure to break my fast.  In any case, I have to do so tomorrow so I can be ready for the upcoming Convocation Week of visiting with family/friends/people I can't wait to never ever see again ;)  I have only posted a few images from my graduating show, but if anyone wants to see more you can just let me know in the comments section.  I have other stuff to put up soon but I need drivers for my goddamn POS scanner.  I somehow misplaced the CD with all the stuff I need for it >:(  I have a couple pics from Formal that I promised a long time ago, plus a few others.    LOL this time last year Nick and I were breaking up!  Although I miss him a lot I suppose it's for the best.  At this time I can see that I had changed so radically from who I actually was (just to please him and avoid his criticism and judgment which was frequent to say the least) that my cheating, all of it, was a desperate attempt to find myself again.  On top of that, the guys who were after me delivered romance and friendship (I'm still good friends with one of them) and unquestioning acceptance.  This was what was absolutely lacking from Nick's part all until the bitter end when it was too late for me to understand how much he was trying to let me know he loved me.  For that I feel truly sorry and would repent if given half a chance.  But seriously, I'd get things like shower-racks and pyjamas and other highly useful yet ABSOLUTELY unromantic things from Nick for Xmas and birthdays until my last birthday (nice clothes) less than a month before we officially hit the rocks.  When other guys offered me flowers, formal dates and other traditional things, I got so confused as to whether Nick loved me or felt something else entirely.  His only salvation is the stack of carefully written letters, especially the ones near the end of our time together, which I will keep as a memento and record of our 3 years.  Words are easy to write or say - it is actions that he so often neglected, promises of which are preserved on paper for many years to come. (Yes, I promised things too, even broke some of them, but the most important and lasting part of our relationship, my unconditional love for Nick, was always delivered and always will be.)  By the end I had ended my cheating ways and was honestly devoted to him, but my life felt empty because I had no friends.  When I started my job at Allie Lou's I suddenly had 60 awesome new friendships to develop and kinda went into overdrive because you see, Nick always encouraged me to have more friends.  I was certain I would please him immensely...but I was wrong.  He got jealous when I only saw him 2, maybe 3 days a week and eventually told me to choose between him and my friends - a ridiculous and entirely self-centered demand!  I toned it down a bit but Nick began accusing me of drinking, cheating and partying to escape.    He was right in a way: I wanted to escape him, or at least the way he was beginning to treat me (as if I was beneath him, scum, a whore, a cheater, for partying instead of dealing with our relationship) and in fact the way he has treated me up to this very day.  But I did NOT cheat and never even considered it.  Nick always wanted me to be what I wasn't, which is why I became the way I did.  He always was such an inconsiderate, self-serving and *above all* self-righteous manipulator.  As a result he is incredibly and appallingly rude in every possible way.  Excuse me, I don't know where that came from but I'm glad it's out LOL!  No wonder he lost me, because I have discovered after this year without him that I am in essence the polar opposite.    I have to admit I truly miss that sex life.  It was pretty decent for long stretches of time.  Plus, when we hooked up for the last time, after we broke up, it was an amazing taste of what could have been had we stuck together.  Oh well.  I heard he's dating someone else now - I hope to god she reads this and leaves before it's too late, especially this next part:  Unbeknownst to me early on in this so-called new relationship he MSN'd me at un ungodly hour to solicit me for sex.  At the time I was briefly seeing another guy and declined to answer until I had the chance to ask him not to request sex again.  I found out much later that he had been seeing this girl at the time.  Maybe he wasn't serious with her, but I think, from what I've heard, she would be upset (as any decent girl ought to be).    After all that, although I don't *love* him that way anymore I will always use the things I learned from him and be incredibly grateful for them.  In that way I do love him for certain, and because we shared a very important time.  Still, it ought to be said that absolutely every single person I have ever encountered who is not one of his 4 major friends absolutely despises him and can't stand to be in the same room as he.  People wanted to throw me a party when he broke up with me; that's no word of a lie.  Honestly, that says something important, and I hope he learns to change!   Anyway, enough of that.  I have found another person for whom I feel more honestly, maybe not as deeply yet, but by whom I am certainly loved unconditionally as Nick was never able to.  OK I'm done.  Bet you all liked that eh?  It was compensation for being so truant from this blog in the last few months :)

       YAY   So, I updated my blog :)  I'll be posting pics (for real now, I'm not BSing) when I can now.  I have a lot of free time and stuff now :)  OK.  News.  After the last post I had a huge talk with Nathan.  He decided to smarten up and since then I have had no reason to be upset or anything.  All the problems I whined about are gone - now it has only been a short while but we are both much happier to say the least.  He got a sweet job at a golf course and makes a shitload now; he's paying me back paycheck by paycheck.  Things are looking up for next year because he plans to take his time finishing his degree (especially because all his fucking-around this year cost him 2 more failed classes in the end) and take another semester if he has to.  I have yet to see for sure if he means it, but I always hope for the best.  Other news: I got the "Most Improved Printmaker" award, which I knew I'd get, but that's beside the point because I have confirmation of my status now.  The competitor in me would have liked to receive "Best Printmaker" instead but I knew someone else was already automatically receiving it.  I like to think that I got the better deal because I have true acknowledgement of my learning curve this year.  I accomplished what I set out to do, which was improve in the area in which I sucked the most (printmaking) to the extent that my work rivals the better students'.  My final show went well.  I'll post some pics (promise!) ASAP.  I'm on the  urlLink Master Cleanser  right now and today is the famous "toughest day" of a fast (the third day)...consequently I am alternating between fevers and chills, high and low energy levels and having to visit the bathroom every 5 minutes.  It's cool though, because I'm not even hungry.  I'm ultra-sensitive to smell though, especially people's body odour (?!!!) and can tell whether they've eaten something bad for them.  For example, Nathan ate hotdogs and lots of coffee yesterday and it was ALL I COULD SMELL when he was in the room.  It grossed me out bigtime.  Plus, the house had chicken and rice and carrots for dinner and it didn't really turn me on much, except the carrots.  I'm going to go vegetarian as much as possible when I come down off this fast.  It's probably much healthier than all the shit I was eating before.  I have to quit early because of convocation and family visiting next week, but afterward I'll be doing the whole 10 days with Nathan, who needs it more than I do.  That guy consumes bad bad things.  Anyway I'll post updates as often as possible.

       Worn out.   I can barely find an entry for the last 4 months that expresses anything positive that Nathan has changed in my life, save the April 12th one that unexcitedly announces we're dating.  The reason for this search is that I am often waiting for calls and meetings with him that never happen because "he hardly ever gets to see the guys" which in a way is true but in most ways, no.  He gives them the very best of himself and I get the leftovers: late and tired evenings, sleeping (10-14 hours a night), hungover afternoons and the 2 hours between the game and the night-out-with-the-boys when he wants to go have Tim Hortons (on me, because he's broke) or have sex.  I wish he would schedule quality time for me that doesn't involve other people (for instance, my birthday weekend which basically was a chance to see Alex...not like it wasn't for me, but we hadn't a single moment alone and sober for the 3 whole days and nights we were there).    I think maybe because I ask for quality time alone with him I don't get it because he feels pressured and smothered.  I don't give too much space, and sometimes I get irrationally upset and say things like "we never really get to spend time with each other anymore."  But seriously, he said he'd spend last night and this evening from 5pm onward with me.  You may ask what he is doing now...  He's with the guys right now because "he didn't get to see them for long enough and they didn't do much last night, so he wants to see them today too."    Sounds a lot like most of the time he and I spend together, but I get the distinct feeling he doesn't care too much about lost time with me.  I'm posting this as a reminder and a promise.  We've been dating a month and I'm already sick of being shunted aside.  I swear now that a month from today if nothing has changed (as Nathan has claimed many times, the summer is different and he can concentrate on me and spend most of our free time together because the guys won't be around) I will break up with him for good.  Anyone who reads this has to hold me to it.  It'll hurt me to break up with him but I must be reminded of how hurt I am at least 3 days a week now.

       Kingston is WEIRD   OK, so I was just out for my usual run, but I went in the morning this time...note to self: never again!  My body protested so much I could barely run the whole way :(  Anyway, I pushed myself and did well enough for a bad day.  I've had worse.  But that's not what this entry is about.    RANT  I just have to say that people are really bizarre here.  I dunno if this stuff would happen to me anywhere or what.  Somehow I seem to attract weirdos and rude people wherever I go, even if I'm minding my own business - NO! - *especially* if I'm minding my own business.  Like if I'm running.  I'll be in my own little world, focusing on my breathing, my body's response and the scenery (I run my the water, where it's always beautiful).    For example, on any given outing, at least 2 cars will honk at me.  At first I thought it was because of something else, like another car or a friend, but gradually I realized it actually was me.  I get the people who yell stuff out their window as well, but I can usually never make out what they're saying.  One day I was almost done a really solid 1 hour run and I had to stop for a traffic light; when I stopped it was the first time I stopped during the entire run and I didn't know how tired I was.  I decided to stop on the sidewalk, bend over at the waist (facing the intersection) and rest my hands on my knees, with my head down.  I'm sure you've seen exhausted athletes do this before...it's nothing unusual.  BUT I guess it was annoying enough that an old lady honked loudly as she drove by.  It wasn't a cheery *beep!* to say hi either.  it was more of a *BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!!!* to say she was irritated.  To this day I don't know why anyone would do that.  I just want to take a second and explain that when I leave the house I am always well-dressed and well-groomed.  I do not wear skanky clothes, although in the summer I have a penchant for tube tops (to avoid strap tans!) and skirts of medium to short length - although they always fit well and never look sleazy or too small.  When I was very little, my parents told me I would be tall and pretty when I got older, so I needed to have excellent posture and an even, confident walk.  People notice it now and ask if I'm a dancer LOL....not a chance!  Anyway, I supposed I stand out more than a little, but almost all the girls at Queen's are gorgeous, rich and well groomed, so why then do I stand out so much?      It gets so bad (I get some kind of attention on at least 5 separate occasions per hour I'm out and I'm not joking or exaggerating because I have kept track more than once) that I worry that maybe I've forgotten to put on a shirt or maybe I'm having my period and blood is leaking down my leg...but I always check myself in the mirror 3 times before I leave, out of habit, and I know when I'm going to start menstruating every time and have never had an accident (there's always a first time I guess).  The truth is that I have NO IDEA why this happens.  Sometimes it's really unpleasant, like the encounter I had with a crazy old guy on a bike just now.  It was pretty confusing and upsetting.  Basically I was running along and suddenly I hear a torrent of filthy language from about 50 metres away, coming closer.  This old guy on a bike is riding towards me along the street, talking crazy shit like "Fuck you!  Can you feel what's fucking emanating from me right fucking now? Fucking bitch....." and that's pretty much what I caught and he rode by, but, as he was yelling, I was able to catch all the cuss words in the English language at least once.  It makes no sense that anyone would choose to yell at anyone on the street for no reason unless they were crazy.  It's still bothering me.  And yesterday I was out taking photographs for referencing when I do my tourist art series, I stopped to take a picture of the sunset and I hear a voice behind me asking what I was doing and oh, wasn't the sky lovely this evening.  I turn around to see this grubby townie guy, maybe 40, 5'6" standing WAY TOO CLOSE.  I was polite and friendly and stated that I was taking a picture of the sky and the church nearby, then took it and started walking away.  He follows me, talking about how he's going to see prettier sunsets where he's going on Sunday.  I keep walking because there aren't may people around, but he follows and catches up to me, mentioning casually that he's going to Kiev and can't wait.  He says the old churches are beautiful at sunset or at any time of day.  He asks me if I take photos as a hobby.  I say no and laugh because I'm really nervous.  He ducks into the townie bar next to us at this point and says to have a great summer.  Now I'm sure he was harmless and friendly, but I'm not an overly friendly person to weird older townie men that come up to me in lonely streets at twilight.  Just at the end of my run today, I learned an important lesson: men in suits may look professional but that again is only the way they LOOK, not the way they ACT.  I ran by this man in a fancy suit with a briefcase who leaned toward me and made kissy sounds.  Some guys can be dressed up, but you can't count on them to behave better than 3-year-old children or intact male dogs.  Maybe you guys are pissed now because this rant sounds arrogant, but honestly I am a self-conscious person. Being treated like I am is very upsetting and I would like it very much if people would just come right out and say what they mean if they think I look pretty or if they like my shirt or my shoes or whatever.  Lots of people do that too, actually, and I love compliments and will always smile and say thank you politely.  Usually random positive comments make my day.  If you have something rude or unpleasant to say to random people on the street, just keep quiet. It doesn't help anything!  /RANT

       It all makes sense now!  I'm hurting pretty badly.   Maybe there will be no posts for a while.  I'm sad.  Looking back, I think I should have anticipated my situation, for I have been substituted often for bachelor-type activities for the duration of the relationship.  I wish I was what Nathan wanted in a partner.  Also, I wish that he had been honest to himself because he would have realized sooner that he still had a lot of wild oats to sow.  I understand perfectly how much Nick suffered last year whilst I hurt him the same way Nathan has hurt me.  I am so, so sorry.  Just now I spoke with him online to apologize and it finally feels like I am free of him :)  No more unfinished business.  Anyway, here it is:   *********************************************** the thunder, perfect mind.  not picton. this is HELL. = Myself Nick = Nick, as in previous ex boyfriend from last summer ***********************************************  the thunder, perfect mind.  not picton. this is HELL. says: Hi Nick.  Do you have a couple minutes to chat?  Nick says: Sure, I guess.  Nick says: What's up?  Nick says: Your status ain't so cheery.  the thunder, perfect mind.  not picton. this is HELL. says: Well, remember what was going on last summer, like how I got a new job and started hanging out with lots of friends and ditching you all the time?    Nick says: A little.  the thunder, perfect mind.  not picton. this is HELL. says: I just want to let you know I know exactly how you felt, and apologize for what I did.  Nathan got a new job this summer and has been doing the exact same thing to me.  Just now he broke up with me because he's happy with his new life.  Seems like karmic retribution eh?  the thunder, perfect mind.  not picton. this is HELL. says: I just thought you'd be interested to hear that.  Nick says: Uh, maybe.  Sorry to hear things aren't going your way.  I assume that things have been rocky for the past while?  Nick says: Just so you know, I don't take any pleasure out of hearing your misfortunes (although the play-within-the-play would be more interesting if I did)  the thunder, perfect mind.  not picton. this is HELL. says: No, other than his ditching me to party with friends.  I had been planning to make sacrifices for him and stuff.    the thunder, perfect mind.  not picton. this is HELL. says: I didn't mean you'd get pleasure, just that you might like to know that I now can sympathize with what you felt when I did that to you.  Nick says: Well, thank you.  Nick says: There's nothing so difficult as being left out.  the thunder, perfect mind.  not picton. this is HELL. says: All I want to do is apologize because I feel pretty bad about it.  I never understood the effects of my behaviour and I'm very sorry.  the thunder, perfect mind.  not picton. this is HELL. says: That's true.  Nick says: Apology accepted, but it was never needed.  the thunder, perfect mind.  not picton. this is HELL. says: Really?  I felt like I had to apologize now, especially because I undestand.  I hope that makes sense.  Nick says: I understand.  the thunder, perfect mind.  not picton. this is HELL. says: Okay.  Thank you.  Nick says: Good luck.  the thunder, perfect mind.  not picton. this is HELL. says: You must be busy, so I'll leave you alone now.  I hope everything is going well with you and I'm sure I'll see you around.  Nick says: kk, ciao.  the thunder, perfect mind.  not picton. this is HELL. says: Bye. ****************************************   Anyway, I'm off to get on with my life.  Maybe I'll post to this blog again soon, maybe not.  Bye for now.

       I wish I could get up earlier in the morning...    urlLink Ray Charles  died yesterday.  I hope to see some tributes!  That guy was way more important than some warmongering president.  In other news, I went to the first meeting of the Queen's Astronomy club yesterday :)  It sounds like it's gonna be fun.  We meet in Ellis Hall at the observatory most of the time, but we've already planned a few field trips, one of which will take place next Friday.  We'll be going to Wolfe Island with the Meade to stargaze.  Anyone who wants to join can still do so.  I'll post here when we plan to meet, or you can email me and I'll forward your email to Melissa, the club founder.  I think I'll choose from Carl's prints today.  Also I think you should all look  urlLink here .  I'm off to Studio, bye for now.

       Victoria Kuzma, BFAH, with Distinction thankyouverymuch.   Convocation was fun and all my relatives got along.  They even sat together!  I have tons of pictures :)  I was completely surprised that I got Distinction because I really didn't think about it at all, and had forgotten about my marks.  Anyway, I'm proud of myself because I earned everything I got.    Yesterday was my first official day in Studio and I had a 2-hour meeting with Carl about my work and choosing one of his prints for my award.  My options are FANTASTIC and I have narrowed it down to 5 out of 30 or so.  I'll post on image of the one I choose.  I'm really torn between choosing a huge print about Greece or one of the smaller, brightly colourful ones.  I have a while to look them over and decide so there's no rush.  Nathan and I are still doing very well; he's making lots of money and working long days.  It's nice to drive-thru at Timmy's and not have to pay.  We're going out for dinner tonight :)

       Hangover....   Nathan and I went out dancing last night.  It was pretty damn fun considering it was just us.  We went out for wings and beer (bad! My stomach did not love me for that so soon after the cleanser), then more beer at Peel Pub, then finally more drinks at Retro night.  We got *hammered* and even still Nathan didn't like the music much LOL!  We left at 12:30 because he needed to be up at 6 for work, and picked up Bubba's on the way home.  Both of us were pretty ill when we woke up.  I'm just lucky I don't have to work.  Tomorrow everybody arrives for my convocation.  Hopefully that goes over well :)  I need to figure out how to get my gown, so I'm gonna do that now.

       OK this is crazy.   Look at this:   urlLink  71.42857142857143% of me is a huge nerd! How about you?   I am not that l33t, I swear.  I guessed most of those questions (although I did know exactly what most of them referred to) so I think maybe I'm just 50% or something.  Otherwise I am a big huge freak.

        MEGA POST       &nbsp; Alright, I think this is gonna take a while.&nbsp; I'll start from as far back as I can remember.  On July 9 my sister and her boyfriend came to visit.&nbsp; It was fun but Nathan had already left to play with his highschool buddies at a cottage somewhere.  Shortly afterward I began work on my Dad's 50th birthday portrait and finished it in about 40 hours' worth of work.&nbsp; It looks nice.  Sometime around then, Erin's boyfriend of 5 months proposed!&nbsp; I'm excited.&nbsp; More updates on that later.  On July 14 Erin's mom died.  On July 15&nbsp;Nathan and I celebrated 1 year of officially being in a romantic relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;  On&nbsp;July 16&nbsp;Nathan went out with his buddies and ended up in another girl's bed.&nbsp; Wait, it gets better...  He told me on July 18 when I was about to leave for Erin's mother's wake.&nbsp; He told me he wasn't sure about 'us' and that he wanted to see this new girl.&nbsp; I cheated on a few boyfriends before, but never on Nathan.&nbsp; I knew that the second I knew I loved someone enough to want to share all of myself with them, I would get cheated on - I suppose it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.&nbsp; In any case I  FLIPPED  and cried for 7 hours straight.&nbsp; Apparently he didn't know I loved him so much.&nbsp; Needless to say I did not make it to the wake or the funeral.  I'm the dumbest person ever, because despite June 13th's entry I took Nathan back, again, for 'one last chance' because I know what it's like to cheat and because I truly believed he is sorry and wants to commit.&nbsp; There better be someone out there praying hard enough for me because I seem to think I can get through anything with Nathan.&nbsp; If this happens again I'll need the strength to get away.&nbsp; Nobody deserves to hurt as much as I do.  Shortly afterward we left for Vancouver to surprise my Dad for his 50th birthday.&nbsp; Everyone out there, including my Dad and godfather Ian, thinks the sun shines out of Nathan's ass.&nbsp; Dad let him drive the Porsche and everything...&nbsp; I sure hope everyone's right and that Nathan really is a good guy and not the bum he's been to me.&nbsp; Being a recovered cheater myself, I know it's possible to stop once you learn to be rational, sympathetic&nbsp;and loving enough.  My Dad's birthday was lovely and we partied like crazy for 3 days straight :)&nbsp; Everyone liked the portrait I did as well.&nbsp; I'll post pictures as soon as I make sure they're OK.  Too tired to type any more...  Good night!  &nbsp;

       Well, well.   A lot has happened in the past while!  For starters, I had a good and productive time alone for about a week before Nathan chose to stick around.  I told him that since I've already given him a ridiculous amount of chances - approximately as many as I've been given in past relationships, to be fair - this is the final one and if he upsets the relationship again I'm cutting him out of my life.  I think that's reasonable.  Anyway, he was, as usual, very contrite, and has made up for the misery in the time since then.  Let me explain...  He took me to PEI where he was born (it's apparently incredibly important to be born there if you want to consider yourself an Islander, because even if you weren't born there but moved there soon afterward and lived there until your death you would be thought of as a Mainlander) for 10 days, then to Ottawa (where his Dad lives) for Canada Day.  Since I had previuosly never travelled to the Eastern provinces I was very excited, especially at the prospect of seafood...mmmmmmmmmmm.....  I understood it was supposed to be pretty there but it was more beautiful than can be explained, which is probably why I was never able to understand Nathan's descriptions.  Even the drive down was gorgeous.  We went through Quebec and New Brunswick and the weather was perfect.  It took us 14 hours including 1/2 hour total in stops for gas, peeing and food.  I don't like to fuck around during car trips if the point is to get from A to B and not for the trip itself.  Anyway we got into PEI at 7 and immediately began sightseeing.  It's fun just to go out and drive around the Island.  It's very picturesque :)  Unfortunately we didn't get many sunny days out there so I didn't get as many pictures as I'd hoped.  The earth is red there, and the beaches are red or pink, with clean sand.  I am in the process of preparing some images to post so you get the idea.  Just to prove it I took home some earth and small rocks as souvenirs :)  Also I went to a HUGE beach with pink dunes and no ocean life, probably the cleanest beach I've ever seen.  The Islanders are very nice and eager to talk your ear off about PEI if you have the time.    The seafood is amazing!  I've had lobster at restaurants but I don't think I will anymore.  You know how restaurant lobster is fluffy and the tastiness is directly proportional to the amount of butter/garlic/lemon seasoning?  This stuff was dense, chewy and flavourful enough that it barely needed plain butter.  Also, the mussels there don't really need seasoning either.  The seafood chowder is chunky and rich.  I had some classic fish+chips with fish that was not as fresh as the rest of the food and yet still tasted fresher than anything I've had since I ate fish fins at Galissas village in Greece.  The only obnoxious thing about PEI is the Anne of Green Gables stuff.  It's overdone and overrated.  For instance, the Green Gables house was a place I planned to visit, but when Nathan and I arrived it cost $5 to even walk around it and on top of that it was built based on L.M. Montgomery's description.  It was not the inspiration for the book at all and was in fact constructed to intrigue and milk ca$h from ignorant tourists (which unfortunately at times include myself and fellow travellers)!  Nathan and I were miffed so we went to the nearby graveyard where Montgomery rests and took pictures of graves.  That's another thing: the graveyards are all very cute there.  Anyway there are A. of G. G. museums, 'heritage sites' and places where L.M.M. was born, died, hung out, ate, bought clothes, blah blah blah and they all cost money.  LAME.  But....that was the only bad thing about the place.  So then we left for Ottawa.  This time the trip wasn't so perfect.  We had only 4 hours to go in the trip when I saw a broken tailpipe in the lane ahead, and couldn't switch lanes to avoid it due to an asshole in my blind spot.  I tried to drive over the pipe by positioning the car so it would pass between the wheels.  The trick would've worked if some part under the car didn't hit the pipe and cause me to drive over it with the rear left wheel.  The tire blew and fixing it cost 2 hours of time.  The best and most significant turn in our relationship happened here: not only did Nathan not get upset, he was patient and consoling when I cried because I was worried I'd wrecked more than just his car's wheel.  He did nothing to upset me further or make me feel guilty.  I'd never experienced anything like that before.  We were both tired (3 horus' sleep the night before) and cranky but he didn't use the incident as an outlet or anything.  What an amazing person...    Afterward when we resumed our driving Nathan fell asleep at the wheel for a split second (I watched his head jerk backward) and we had to pull over and rest.  Scary, scary.  We were fortunate that the alignment and steering on the Camaro is rock solid.  Still, we made it to Ottawa in 15 hours including about 3 hours' delay...overall not bad.  Canada day was awesome.  We had a baby shower for Nathan's stepsister and afterward went to a party where we pounded some drinks before heading off to the bus to the Hill.  I drank wine by the canal with Nathan and his high school friends until it got dark and we walked to Parliament Hill for a short free Tom Cochrane concert and fireworks.  Did you know they can make fireworks explode in patterns like rainbows (complete with different colours) hearts and (get this!) pentagrams?  Well they can and I saw them, and NO I was not on drugs or even very drunk at all.  So we went home after that and slept for 10 hours :)    Most importantly I found myself increasingly grateful that I gave Nathan another (final) chance.  His parents seemed shocked at the behaviour I complained of (he brought it up...stuff like failing core courses for his degree and gambling/drinking/smoking too much). It's as though he's not really like that - what a relief, since I worried that he was.  Yesterday we got home and now it's back to life as usual, except Nathan is now the most amazing person I know as opposed to one of the true sources of grief in my life.  I hope it stays that way :)

       Drunken post     I hate Paypal.  Seriously, never use it!  They charged me $1 american for everything, just because I'm in Canada.  I just got a refund from a guy who ripped me off for a pair of sunglasses - he sent it to Paypal who promptly charged me $1.40 for a deposit I couldn't control, then 50 cents to transfer it to my account.  If I was american I wouldn't have to pay that much AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF THE EXCHANGE RATE!  Anyway, don't use Paypal.   urlLink http://www.paypalsucks.com   urlLink http://www.paypalwarning.com   I'm drinking because I can't sleep and my cure doesn't work.  I hate my life.

       Happy "I'm not going to complain about my relationship" Day!   I had the most amazing dream last night.  It was seriously worth all the insomnia - I lay in bed for 5 hours before using my double-M miracle cure (masturbation followed by meditation...it gets rid of lots of energy FAST) and passing out immediately.  I'll use it earlier next time.  I'll get sidetracked for a second to state that I went for a run this morning and couldn't complete it...I lost too much energy via my 'cure' so, ladies, NEVER do heavy cardio after jilling off!  I learnt the lesson so you don't have to!  OK, the dream.  I'm not going to mention names, but suffice it to say that it included a guy (not Nathan and that leaves 500 other guys I know, so have fun guessing!), myself and a sunny afternoon/evening vegging out on a bed and basking in the sun coming through the window.  It was the kind of dream you can't stop remembering all day.  Yay fantasies!  The only bad part about them is that they never happen :(  I'm off to play D&D in a couple hours.  It's fun as long as I get to keep my new weretiger character.  Mark likes killing characters off and I'll be pissy if she has to die.  Also, it's even more fun if the arguing is kept to a minimum; my other gaming group didn't fight so much about the littlest things.  The less technical, the better, but I've only been playing for 8 years - what do I know?  I'm also a girl.  Maybe that makes me a less-competitive D&D player.  I still love it though; it's a good excuse to socialize for long hours into the night, eat Subway and Miss Vickie's chips, and avoid drinking.  Plus I get to see Erin.

       To the visitor who commented two posts ago:   You have had a similar experience to mine, but it's disappointing to hear that you two eventually broke up and that you're regretting it because you're lonely.  It's true that a lot of the resentment I hold toward Nathan is based on my idea of him as lazy, and that I'm incredibly dissatisfied; I'm the type of get-up-and-go person who prefers a day outside in bad weather (unless it's the gross snowy kind we get in Kingston...I'd enjoy that more if there was good skiing around here!) to a day inside in good weather, also, I can't sleep past 10am unless I went to bed at 9am, even if I've been drinking heavily, and most importantly I make a point of doing things I don't like but are good for me because I love a challenge (it's the reason I took printmaking in school - I sucked AND hated it AND had the chance for top marks in painting...but in the end I got second in class and an award for improving so much).  Those everyday things, of which Nathan prefers the easier choices, are compounded (as you probably know from reading this blog) by his avoidance of dealing with serious issues, like his educational future, eating habits, deciding whether to quit football, his feelings for me, and his compulsion to play poker and get high on work nights until 3am and then lie about it.  By the way, that last one denotes addictive behaviour does it not?  His local friends are also addicts.  It makes me wish his friends from home lived a little closer.  My advice to myself, based on a great amount of experience, is simply to   accept  his shortcomings and get on with my own life, regardless of how difficult it is not to help out.  I always say you can't change a man unless he's still in diapers!  I've found that in an environment of complete acceptance and patience one is encouraged to improve - plus, I won't be so upset all the time from worrying about my failure to motivate him.  So that's what I'm doing.  I enrolled in bartending school yesterday so I can get a lucrative job (so I can take my OWN ass out to dinner) and am making a point of visiting every friend who invites me out.  Plus I'm doing the little things I love to do that I wish Nathan would join me in but doesn't, such as walking my the water and exercising.  It feels as though I've put my life on hold because I've ceased doing what I love in the hopes that we could do them together (sharing things I love is fun) and I know thats absolutely wrong and completely backward.  Also, I'm blogging again.  It helps me sort out my feelings and it shows me how I change day to day.  For instance I used to think it was OK to cheat on a partner (see posts mid-March) but now I believe it's totally wrong because I've learnt a lesson about it.  Also, it gives me a chance to analyse myself and develop helpful strategies on my own, because I hate going to counselling.  As for your experience, I'm sorry that it's been such a long while that you've been trying unsuccessfully to connect with someone.  I know how you feel, exactly how you feel.  Have you tried Lavalife or other dating services?  My best friend found her soulmate online and they're getting married in 3 weeks after only 7 months of knowing each other!  Before him, she dated about 6 guys she met through Lavalife in 2 months, so at the very least you'll gain experience :)  Yes, you've got it!  Happiness _is_ a choice.  Also, you will not truly connect with someone until you can feel happiness on your own and have been living it for some time.  It's easy to lose happiness when you choose someone else instead.  I have a bad habit of doing so and have never really been happy for long.  Nobody will bring it to you; it's not that easy, although I sure as hell wish it was :)  Good luck, and keep in touch via this blog if you like.  Or do you have your own?  I'd love to read updates on how you're doing.    That was a really long-winded way of saying thank-you for your comment.

      I should probably take it easy about Nathan.  I guess I'm just bitter because he's got flaws that keep him tied to the bachelor lifestyle; naturally, tendencies toward bachelorhood are not what I would prefer in a man (especially since I'm not getting any younger!!!!).  Anyway, he has more good things about him than any other guy I've dated.  I guess that's why I hang on.  Lately I've been thinking about getting a job.  Before I try I think I'll take a bartending course so I can work less and make more :)  That leaves more time to study for LSATs/pick up a course for the MCAT/make art.  Speaking of art, I'm making a gallery website!  It'll be at  urlLink www.victoriakuzma.com , of course, and when it's up I'll mention it here and put up a link.  For now it's just a splash page leading to an 'under construction' page.

      Today was uneventful.  My brother came over to hang out this afternoon while I waited for Erin and Mark to show up.  At 4, they did, and we played D&D with the usual crowd.  Nothing screams "dork" louder than 5 hours of D&D...  I'm home now and I think I'm gonna read a bit then go to sleep.  I was just reading back on some of my old posts, out of sheer boredom.  I really think I'm an idiot for staying around Nathan so long.  I mean, on this very page is written a solemn vow to drop him if he fucks up again...and within a month he cheated on me AND I TOOK HIM BACK.  What bigger fuck-up is cheating?  There's nothing you can do worse to ruin a relationship.  Technically, he claims, he didn't have sex with her, but HE WANTED TO and if she wasn't a decent girl he WOULD HAVE.  Anyway,  comments are welcome  about how dumb I am for doing this.  Maybe I should've just stuck with Lavalife, or nobody at all.  As far as I know, I'm incapable of rational thought when it comes to this situation, if only because EVERYONE else I know (who, for the record, have all disapproved of all other prospects), except for Erin and Mark, who see the most of me, thinks he's a good catch.  Let's review:  Good things about Nathan (* denotes a relative Bad Thing):  -when times are good, they're really, really good -social skills/good first impression/can talk to virtually anyone and hold a conversation -good personal hygiene, and good-looking for that matter -unusually patient, especially with me -great in bed* -great with kids -he chased me for almost 8 months before I finally gave in and dated him, which accounts for something, right?  -similar goals for the future, i.e. where to live, kids, planned income, sensible things like that -his family is similar to mine and we had a similar upbringing, plus I like them a lot -if he actually gets his ass in gear he'll do very, very well in life -he understands me and knows me better than anyone else, ever; this was almost an intuitive thing to begin with -he thinks I'm hot* -he can sing like nobody I've ever heard before; seriously he's amazing -he gives the best hugs ever  Bad things about Nathan:  -he cheated on me -deliberately misleads me so he can have his way about little things like phone calls or big things like cheating -Erin dislikes him -*great in bed if he initiates, but usually when I make a move he turns me down, like for the last 3 out of 4 times I've dared to hit on him. -no ambition or concrete future career plans -LAZY about everything, from schoolwork to health issues to housework and never does anything for which he can't get immediate personal gain in about 15 minutes, tops -to supplement the above, he is unable to understand the consequences of a lot of his behaviours unless they have the 15-minute-gain effect...his foreseeable future is not longer than that 15 minutes -he may have a gambling addiction and has spent over $150 in the past couple months (that he will admit to losing...I believe he's lost more) -smokes pot and eats shrooms when I'm around even though I asked him not to (I don't care if he does it every once in a while, just not around me...and anyway, how does this affect his child-producing capabilities? Will they be susceptible to deformities of the mind or body?), PLUS he thinks those are OK things to do and I shouldn't be upset...even though they interfere with his life (school, mainly, but socially with me as well) -chronically late and disrespects my personal schedule, i.e. if he says 6pm, I'm ready by then, but he shows up at 8 with little or no good explanation.  I'm 90% sure it's only because he's selfish and not because he's cheating -*he's not the only amazing guy who has ever thought I was hot  **************************************************************** Anyway, that's all I can think of for now.  I wish I could solve this puzzle more easily.  P.S.  I love Nathan more than anyone before him (naturally!)  but love is never enough on its own, in my opinion.
