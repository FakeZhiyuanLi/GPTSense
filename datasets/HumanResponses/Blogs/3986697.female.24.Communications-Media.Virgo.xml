      I love thrift store shopping. You never know what you may find to purchase or thank the lord you never wore. Yesterday I got a Rainbow Brite t-shirt in perfect condition for only $2.00! That's what I'm talkin' about.   There are, I feel, some important things to remember though.   1. Value does not always equal fashion. I can deeply appreciate that sometimes the wallet does not afford the coolest fashion. But there is a line where self-respect must be maintained. Sequined t-shirts leaps right over this line.   2. If you see a lot of something, there's probably a lot more of it out in the world, and it's probably just as ugly.  3. CHECK FOR STAINS, HOLES, AND MISSING PARTS BEFORE PURCHASE.   4. Keep and open mind. Sometimes I buy things for the alteration possibilities they posess. My mom used to buy things just for their buttons.   5. Do not ask an employee if they have something you like in another size. This ain't no Mervyn's.   6. If you can smell an article of clothing from the rack, it's a lost cause and should only be used in psychological warfare.  7. If someone is looking at clothing on the other end of the same rack you are at, it's only okay to shove all of the clothes towards their end and then pick through them if they do it to you first.

      1. Arrive early, DO NOT GET LOST ON THE WAY. It will only cause stress and you're taking pills for that now so you don't have to worry so much.   2. Check in with family members. Say this several times, "Hi! You look so nice! Who else is here?"   3. Comandeer your infant neice, get a seat in the front row, taunt other family members with the fact that they do not have infant to hold. Haha.  4. When infant neice throws up on your black shirt during the ceremony, do not cry out, do not jump (shaking the baby more is bad). Calmly get up, and go find a paper towel to clean off yourself and baby. Following the baby's mother who is carrying her screaming toddler is a good idea, surely there will be towels in the direction she is going.   5. Introduce yourself to your parents and grandparents in the receiving line. You've got a rhythm going, there's no need to interrupt that for family.   6. Circulate. Nobody likes a lazy, sit-down, moper.   7. When your older brother says that you are going to give an impromptu speech with him and your sister, you do it, and you think damned fast about what you're going to say in 2 minutes. DO NOT CRY DURING THE SPEECH. But if your voice warbles, people will just think you are wicked-crazy sincere.   8. Don't eat too much, you are taking up valuable space where free beer could be.   9. Try to give your brother and sister-in-law as many hugs as possible. This will be difficult, so set your goals low. Like, three hugs is a good goal.   10. Allow the Matron of Honor convince you it's okay to steal a bottle of wine and put it in your car really fast so noone notices in case it's not okay.   11. Instigate a water fight with your mother while everyone else is cleaning up, you will really appreciate the bonding and cooling effects this has on a 96 degree day. Let your mother win.   12. Do not let your toddler nephew eat too many bubbles.   13. When the Best Man (who is married to the Matron of Honor) offers you Gatorade, take it. Try to restrain yourself when you realize it's mostly Everclear in the bottle. Find a way to take a bottle home for yourself.   14. Take home as much stuff as you can. Quite often you can get new flower arrangements (and vases!) and candy and little votive candle holders. These can save a lot of valuable decorating dollars in the long run.   15. Drive really, really carefully going home if it's been less than 2 hours since you drank that Ever-Ade.

      This story would not fit in my profile. But it was too much typing to lose.     Once upon a time, in the forest just behind your house, there was a small pond.   "What pond?" you say, "Shut up and don't question me when I'm telling a story." I retort.   In this pond there was a froggy, and he was a very, very lonely froggy. For even though he was an ace public speaker, never cheated at cards, and was a good dancer, he was bald. Like a slimy green cue ball. The other well-coiffed frogs shunned him. Betty Frog with her perfect Beehive (perfect for catching a mid-afternoon snack), Bernard Frog with his retro-throwback Duck's Ass, perfectly gelled at all times. They would ignore this poor, lonely frog, who's parents were so embarassed they had abandoned him without giving him a name. Froggy spent his days on a log, searching for flies the others had not already picked out, and wishing he had hair.  One night, as he lay crying himself to sleep on his lily pad, a bright light appeared before him. He rubbed his froggy little eyes and tried to adjust to the light. As soon as this was done, the light faded and in it's midst was a beautiful woman with long red hair and a blue lab coat. "Who are you?" asked the frog. "Who do you think I am, silly?" asked the woman. "I really don't know, that's why I freaking asked you, lady." he said. The beautiful woman bristled and made a very un-ladylike gesture, then composed herself and said "I am here to give you a gift, to make your image-obsessed dream come true to that you can conform to society's standards and be acceptable." She reached into the pocket of her lab coat and pulled out a tiny, blonde, spiky-mess-bed-head-super-trendy-styled wig. She knelt beside the frog and placed it on his head. It fit perfectly.   The frog began weeping with joy. "Th-th-tha-ank you, kind lab technician." he said through his ecstatic tears. "You are most welcome, dear Froggie." she said. Suddenly all was returned to darkness, and the woman was gone.  Froggie woke up the next morning and immediately clutched his head, afraid that it had all been a dream. He felt luscious, thick, immaculately styled hair. He almost cried again, but crying is for pussies and he'd done quite enough of that alone in the dark. Now he was going to be popular. Out he went in search of that Betty and the Bernard. He heard noises in a thicket of bushes and went to make his grand entrance into what would surely be his great new group of friends. When he looked in, he nearly died of shock. All of the frogs were BALD now! That double-crosser lab technician! Froggy remained hidden, realizing that he would never be accepted solely for his looks, he left the pond that day to live amongst the arty and hip of Greenwich Village in New York City.   The End.

      Sunday I went to Fred Meyer, nothing unusual there, pretty tame. Then people started staring at my crotch.  No, seriously. I caught at least 2 people staring at my crotch area. What is that? How many more could have been covertly eyeing my cooter?&nbsp;When I got out to the parking lot I looked very carefully and saw no discoloration, oozing, movement, or flashing lights in my crotch. (I've been thinking about the flashing lights though, I think it could really help my sex life.) And I know I was wearing pants because I always check that a bunch of times before I leave the house.

      I should have been wishing for IQ-based genocide all along.  On Saturday mornings when I go grocery shopping, I begin my day thinking, "I am going to get good food! I am going to make good things! Whoopee!" Without fail, however, within five minutes the trip to the grocery store goes from a simple task that affirms my abilities as a Self-Sufficient Young Adult to becoming a Necessary Evil bordering on War Game. Away from the store, safe in my house, the grocery store is a bounty of healthy food and tasty snacks. Refreshing beverages and clean, brightly lit aisles and a cart where all four wheels run smoothly.  I am big time into repression and delusion.  Invariably, I will encounter people who represent exactly what the rest of the world is talking about when they say they hate America. People are rude, they are pushy, and they have a slightly glazed look in their eyes and stand in the very middle of an aisle for several minutes at a time. People also like to move their carts and stop right in front of me as I am walking and then stare at me with wonderment when (surprise!) I almost hit them. This morning someone had just abandoned a cart in the cleaning product aisle, and another woman took several minutes to ponder which plastic gallon-size zipper bags were the right choice. She did this by constantly pacing in front of me as I was trying to fit between her cart and the abandoned one. I nearly clocked her with a box of trash bags. I also particularly love the parents who have four children all under the age of six and are letting them run loose but yelling at them for...get this... being children . That's bad parenting. I don't care how frustrated you are. It's your own damned fault if they're being unruly.  But the real meat of today's excursion happened when I was on my way to my car, my solace, and my promise of it all being over for another week. As I approached I noticed two people, a young woman and an older gentleman, near my car. As I got closer I realized they were  leaning on my car  looking at papers of some kind. I assume there was some sort of accident and they were exchanging insurance information. It's cool and all that no one got hurt, but get off my damn car. It's not a desk. It's not a table. It's not YOURS. I got up to my car and they both seemed oblivious to me. "Excuse me," I said, "can I help you?" The older man looked up and said, "Oh, are we writing on your car?" What I said was "Yeah" and they both moved. What I should have said was "Is it YOUR car? No. So get off." I'll be kicking myself for not saying that for a long time coming. The man, proving himself to be completely charming, then looked at the young girl and  rolled his eyes and made the "meneneneneh" noise.  I should have backed out and then hit them. It's not like my car is all that nice.   Also, I saw no less than two midgets at the store.
