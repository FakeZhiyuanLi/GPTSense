						   On Sat at 7:45am, I left the house for the Simatai segment of the Great Wall.  True to backpacker's spirit, I took the local bus to the town Miyun bus terminal.  I tried but couldn't get rid of the looking lost look as I went looking for the bus to get to the Great Wall.  Got followed by a mini "bread" van driver who kept following me asking where I was going.  I said the WC.  He waited for me outside, scaring me half to death.  Ignored him and went to look for my local bus.  Finally shook him off when a woman driver decided to take her chances with me.  At 10:45am  got on the local bus, and about 1.5hrs later, got off at an intersection, hopped on the back of a motorcyle for final 4km to the Great Wall.  What a relief to see foreigners!       Simatai is the most spectacular of the 4 Great Wall sections I have seen.  On one side is Hebei province and the other Beijing.  Layers of mountains on top of other disappearing in the mist.  And the Great Wall, really looking like a long long dragon crawling on the mountain tops, and disappearing into the mist too!  Felt the condition of the wall is closer to several hundred years of wear and tear.  Some sections of course have been repaired.  With modern bricks and cement.  Other sections remain fragmented as the cultural ministry brass have wisely decided that the wall shouldn't be repaired with modern day bricks. And it was difficult to buy back the bricks "stolen" by locals who used them to build their homes or to sell as souvenirs to tourists.  I did the whole 12 (out of 18) towers open to tourists.  The remining ones are too hair raising to be ! used by anyone legally.  Though the Chinese backpacker's guide said it's doable.    After my awesome climb (4hrs with lots of rest and photos--regret not buying new lens yet), I didn't really want to go back to Beijing yet as I had 3 days holidays.  Wanted to see the Black Dragon Pond park area in another  section of the county on Sunday.  So got onto a mini bread van to get back to the intersection to catch the last bus and planning to spend the night in a hotel in Miyun.  The van driver convinced me to stay at his home, a designated "folk home" for 10RMB a night.   His village of about 200 people, is specially designated to be be folk tourist homes.  The village is only a 5 min walk from the entrance of the Great Wall.   And the next morn for 100RMB he agreed to take me to the Black Dragon Pool park, and finally to the Miyun bus station.  After a dinner of wild mushrooms (nonpoisonous), and vegetables for 20RMB, went to bed at 8:30pm.&n! bsp; Didn't believe I could go to sleep that early.  Guess wrong.  I was out! So were all lights in the village.  Pitch black and silence all around.  Next morn at 4:30am, the driver woke up (his family and village all wake up at this time!) and got me up at 5am.  In just over an hour, we arrived at park entrance at 7am. The workers there were brushing their teeth over the outside sinks.  The park doesn't open until 7:30am but the driver swore all parks in his vacinity (considered Hebei territory) opened at all hours! So he was at a loss to find Beijing tourist sites so unaccommodating!  We waited and watched the peddlars set up their ware outside the entrance...I must have dozed off.     At 7:45am the gate opened, and I went in with the park vendors who were lagging loads of instant noodles, and watermelons...The park is basically a hiking trail set in a valley with many water falls (but little water).  It's a good hike for exercise but not much of a sightseeing, especially after the Great Wall.  The air was exceptionally fresh in the early morn, and I had all the sounds of nature to myself.  Including my pounding heart from sheer exertion mixed with the fear of solitude. As the first visitor to the park, it was a bit scary to go alone in the trail.  Though there were vendors by every fall, and attendants with walkie talkies.    My anxiety didn't abate when near the end of the trail at 9:30am, I found 7 vendors/attendants sharing Er Guo Tou (a liquor with above 50% alcohol).  I sat by them on a slope overlooking the Dragon Pearl pool, and looke! d them in the eyes as they also looked me up and down, and asked if I was alone.  I said there were others coming...About 10 min later, they dispersed, with half heading right and other left along the trail.  I remained seated, a bit relieved to be alone again(?), and finished off my last Snickers, and one of the tomato which didn't tasted funny.   By this time it was about 9:45am.  Looking on the map, I was really close to the end of the trail.  As I sat debating whether to head back or go on, a real visitor came through, and then a woman, and then a flood of young people!  Suddenly the morning's freshness and the silence dissipated.  As did the fear of being alone.  I followed the crowd and after another 100m to the end of the trail.  The earlier Er Guo Tou attendents were now renting out rubber tubes to visitors to paddle in the source pool of Dragon Pool. (Hmm...the ability of these! attendents to rescue anyone falling into the pool...) For 15RMB, what the heck, I decided to try it too.  If I fell in, I fell in, camera and all.  I set the precedent.  No, not by falling in. But the first female to go in to join the boys.  The pool was deep, but not wide, so everyone just paddled and bumped into each other.  I did my share of the bumping, drifting, and shouting at strangers...and took pictures of them!  Pity, no one took pictures of me!         At 10:45am I headed back down the trail.  The feeling became one of following a pack of rowdy primary school kids though I swore their T-shirts said XX college.  They were hollering, racing, and going off the marked trail.  One boy actually fell into a shallow pool when he was egged on to run across a slippery incline.  He looked stunt amongst his laughing classmates as he tried to wash off the mud from his leather shoes.  And despite all the "environmentally awareness" public compaigns and the on-site "Do not litter" signs, the kids continue to chuck water bottles/trash along the trail... I didn't know whether I should be more afraid of these young people or the intimating solitude experienced just a few hours earlier.     My driver was waiting for me inside the entrance.  He didn't have to pay because he told them he was looking for his client, me, who hadn't come back in the agreed 3hrs.    We left the park at 11:30am, and into Miyun at 12:30 pm for me to catch bus back to Beijing by 2pm.  Quite a fulfilling weekend, to say the least.       I must be fit as I didn't feel as tired/sore as I expected.  I will likely go back to Simatai Great Wall again, as there are still 2 sections connected to it.
