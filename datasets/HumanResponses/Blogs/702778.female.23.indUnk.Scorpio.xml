       Dinner with bonnie, bren, flora, kev and trish, at Ten-ichi was fun...I ate a lot, we kept on ordering food without knowing how much it actually turned out to be.  We ended up playing 5-10-15 to determine who will eat the last piece of sushi since everyone was full.  Kev managed to eat three servings of green tea ice cream after all the salmon sashimi and sirloin steak he ate.  Flora enjoyed the beef/steak a lot too, oh and that salty egg in a cup...haha...we had fun laughing at each other, but especially at the people sitting behind us and the "smily" waiter.    After dinner we decided (finally) to come back to my house to play MJ and watch VCDs.  I suck at MJ, thank god money was not involved.  We even managed to which the direction of the rotation in the middle of rounds, we just made up our own rules and played the game our way.  Surprisingly Kev was the expert amongst us...I think I need to ask Wen and Flora to teach me how to play properly too...I only know how to "eat chicken".  Flora just enjoyed the VCDs and my old uglye brown sofa in the basement...she said it was "comfy"...I dunno about that, but it's definitely OLD!!...haha  >_

      I wasn't really suppose to have fun this weekend since I still have another exam, but I did...keke.  Went out to Tonic to celebrate my cousins' b-day, and flora's b-day (kinda) saturday night.  There was a lot of ppl there, saw a lot of familiar faces and the crowd was not bad.     Sunday, went to flora's to officially celebrate her b-day, the "bring-whatever-food-you-can" dinner turned out pretty good, we actually had food!!...(plenty of it...), and the mingling of different groups of people did work out...good job flora!! Hope you enjoyed everything: the ppl, the food, the gifts, the cakes...oh yeah, and that TAIWAN flag you wouldn't let go of...haha.    Labour Day Weekend Trip to Montreal is coming along...still trying to figure out what we're gonna do.  Gonna go to Jap-buffet din-din tonite >_

       Yesterday was fun!! I went to MHQ for all-you-can-drink night and karaoke.  Although i didn't drink much since i had to wake up early the next day and go into Barrie to register.  But i ws fun meeting ricky's friends...but i think chris needs glasses cuz i really have no clue why you think _ _ _ _ _ _ _ is good-looking.  Yet, again, STUPID Tony backed out and does not show up :0(...i think I have given up on him, he has forgotten about us girlies...We definitely have to get together and have fun again, i'm gonna practice my 5-10-15 so i can be fast too!!    I got up bright and early this morning, loaded the car with more of my stuff and headed to Barrie again.  I dropped off my stuff at rez and went to Registration @ 9:00.  I got my schedule, ID card and booklist. I also ordered my internet and phone service, it costs a fortune!!  I also met a couple of new people in my program, they're all very nice.  I also met two of my roomates/suitemates today, one of them is in my program too, but our schedules are quite different.  Just to make some of you jealous...I get Friday's off, i have two hours of class Tuesdays and Wednesdays!!...lol...but i have a full day from 8-4 on Thursdays.  I joined the fitness club at Georgian so i think i'll be able to use the spare time a have wisely...hahaha. >_

       Yesterday I went to K with Angela, Bonnie, Bren and Doris...it was some early K speical @ MHQ.  It was my first time going to K so early (around 5) and it was also my first time seeing Doris since May.  She went to HK for the entire summer and traveled to Japan too, I'm jealous!!...I can't wait to see all her pictures and the stuff she bought!!...Jo joined us after she got off work and we went to dinner at some Taiwanese Restaurant, the food was alrite.      I moved some of my stuff into Georgian today.  I am living on the 4th floor of the second building at Georgian Greens.  I haven't met my suite-mates yet, but supposedly four out of the five (not including me) have already gotten their keys and have moved in before me...just in case anyone is wondering...no, none of them are asian :0(...aw...well, the people I have met so far are all very nice.  I am anxious to get my schedule on Friday, hopefully I get Friday's off so I can come back to TO and party!!...lol. Tomorrow will be shopping day, I have to go and buy all the stuff I need and don't have yet for rez.  Oh, and internet is soooooo expensive!! It's probably because there isn't a phone line in my room so I have to pay for the phone line and interment service...it totals to $70+ if i go with High Speed or if I resort to Dial-up then it's around $55+...dunno what I'm gonna do yet...i'll have to figure it out by Friday.

       I have a lot to blog about...went to Montreal over the long weekend, the trip did not turn out as i had hoped it to.  I have to apologize to someone (you know who you are) for forcing you to come on the trip...i couldn't even imagine the pain you went through.  You thought you were ruining the trip for the rest of us, but really, i felt maybe ten times worse having to see you go through what happened.  I will remember this trip though, since it was my first trip with you guys.  Next time, we'll just plan something in toronto and have fun here >_  I came back to Toronto monday night...i packed a couple of things for school the next day and headed to bed.  Bright and early, 8:00 tuesday morning, my sister drove me into Barrie.  When i got back to my room, my mirror fell over the weekend and it was all shattered on the carpet...URGH!!...i went out and bought another one, along with some school supplies, dropped them off at rez and headed for my first class on tuesdays, which starts at 12:00...hehe.  I did not eat lunch until 3:00pm!!  i had coffee and some tim bits at 8:00am...then i headed back to rez to unpack and clean-up my room.    On wednesday, i only had a lab in the morning.  So after lab i went back to rez and had lunch...then headed out to the mall with one of my roommates (i have five) to buy stuff for our bathrooms.  Lemme say that Barrie transit is WEIRD...buses come at weird times...then on our way back the cab driver robbed us!!...j/k...but yeah, the ride was expensive!!...then we had an "American Idol" marathon.    chatting on the phone.....blog later

       Well...i kinda left my blog hanging for a week...hahaha, my internet is still not hooked up in Barrie yet, so it's inconvenient for me to go back on campus every time need the computer, so i decided to wait until i come back to Toronto to update my blog.    Last thursday was a full day from 8am-4pm...but at least i was looking forward to the end of the day cuz i get to come back to TORONTO!!...didn't do much thursday nite, stayed home.  Friday, i went to a WEDDING!!...it was a very pretty wedding at a manor @ yorkmills and don mills...it was a historical house with a huge garden with pretty flowers....the pictures turned out alright.  I also got to sit in a HUMMER 2...it was so cool, bren and jo DROVE it...hahaha, we were all in dresses riding in ahummer, it was so funny, getting on and off the car was amusing to watch too.  The reception was a Ruby, that was kinda boring, but i saw a lot of family friends and my parent's acquitances who have known my parent's before i was born...pretty cool.    Saturday met up with Alex (who just came back from HK on Tues), Bonnie, Mitch and Danbee for bbt...Mitch and Danbee left early, leaving us girls chatting away...i had fun...love the POOH door handle (thanx Alex)...and i'm using the gloss and the change pocket too (thanx Danbee...u'r too sweet).    Second week of school flew by, i am getting homework now, but i haven't been keeping up with it, i just throw everything aside.  I have met a lot more people now, talked with some second  years, learned a lot from them.  Hopefully Ellen can find those extra texts she has so i don't have to pay full price for the new ones...very expensive!!  Suzanna, a girl i met at orientation finally came back from HK and is attending classes now...although our schedules are not hte same we still get to see each other in the full classes and during our GED class.  She'll be my ride back home on Thursdays from now on.    Today, classes were cancelled after 11:00am due to the health sciences first year orientation...we sat through the intro, had our pizza lunch and left.  Went to the bookstore to pick up some books with Suzanna and then headed back to rez to pick up my junk.  I got back to markham by 1:00pm!!  We went to Staples to photocopy some stuff...$15 only...hahaha (staples is stupid!!) and then she drove me home.    I'm gonna be downtown tomolo...call me.

       Today (well actually yesterday, cuz it's technically thurs now) i went to a PILATES class...it was FUN! All the moves we did i already learned from the Winsor Pilates video...keke.    I went over to my friend's place after the PILATES class, she lives at the new student residence, and we made spinach dip (it's our techniques presentation)...it was YUMMY!...then when i came home, my roommates decided to go shopping so i joined them (one of them had a car).  It was a total bonding experience...we came home and started to cooked for each other?!?...then there were small chat sessions going on in different ppls rooms...it moved to MINE too...i really didn't want them hanging out in my room...i wanted to sleep...they all finally left, and i'm ready to go to bed now (lab @ 8am tomolo).    It's a BIG weekend for BARRIE...they have their annual AUTO SHOW this weekend. >_

       My weekend was pretty laid back...came home thursday, did nothing that nite.  Friday, went downtown to get my transcript and had lunch with bonnie, bren, carol, trish and shal.  I also stopped by my old HS to pick up something...a lot has changed since I was there.  Most of the teachers have changed...they are soooo young now! and the students...um...lets not comment about them here.    I went to BBT with doris and sylvia on Saturday...i finally got the chance to see ALL their pictures from HK...very pretty and i can tell they had lotsa fun...i wanna travel now!!...keke...But while we were in the new Destiny, there was a HUGE thunderstorm outside...it was pretty scary, thank god doris was smart and brought an umbrella with her...thanxs!...keke.  Angela stopped by for awhile andthen took off to meet her other friends, cece showed up too...i saw all her pics too from vegas, disney world and mexico...oh, and her pressed pennie collection too...my fav one was BOO from monsters Inc.    Sunday, woke up early to go to the Vegetarian Food Fair with Jo...big mistake...there were soooo many road closures downtown that morning...and when we FINALLY got to harbourfront the fair consisted of only ~10 booths...sucks!! I guess it's because it's "no admission"...but it's sooooo cheap...Jo just hopped off the car, picked up all the pamphlets she could get, hopped back on and off we went...hahaha, it took us awhile to find a road back out of that area...terry fox run, road closures...we finally got home, had lunch and i went to take a NAP.  We had a FAMILY dinner that night, my aunts, uncles and cousins came over...it was fun, we chatted alot...got more pics back from Chris...Joyce and Vincent had a lot of fun playing with their hello kitty and robot lanterns...keke...then, we showed chris and carrol the pic of us when we were kids...an older relative found it back in his collection of pics...hahaha...it was funny, my aunt didn't recognize her own kids!!  I think i actually like these gatherings more now...i actually appreciate the time we can spend together as a big family...>_  Last but not least, i don't have class until 2:00pm today, so my friend is gonna drive me back in @ 11:30...hopefully my bell modem has arrived when I get back.

      Have you ever looked around and thought about the different kinds of people around you; your friends you've known since forever, the people you hang out with now, new people that you meet on a daily basis, who somehow you become good friends with...they are all DIFFERENT...why have you chosen them (or why have they chosen you) as a friend?    Someone who I was not very close to made me feel very special, she gave me a letter and told me WHAT A GREAT FRIEND I was...how CARING I am and how special it was for her to know me and be my friend.  It really hit me, that I can actually make someone feel very special by JUST BEING THEIR FRIEND.  I really appreciated this person TELLING me what I meant to them, cuz I really had no idea my friendship meant that much to her.    My second encounter: I have met another person, she's very nice, I get along with her very well...we've known each other for about a month now.  She does me great favors by driving me to and from markham and barrie, when I go home.  I had it all planned out, I was gonna to split gas expenses with her, but she refused to take it...she said that the comprimise will be that whenever she needs lunch, she'll come over to my rez for food...I thought alrite, i have plenty of food, she can come over whenever she likes...then she calls me later tonight and tells me she's gonna BRING ME FOOD (fresh noodles, wontons...etc)...easy stuff,  so I can keep it in my fridge/freezer so that I have food at hand that's quick and easy to make?!? *confused*...she won't take my MONEY for gas, then she BRINGS me food?!?...can there actually be such people who are SOOO nice?...what have I done...or not done...why are people being soooo nice to me?...i'm not complaining, i'd just like to analyze this and figure out the reason behind all this.  It's weird how you've known someone for awhile, but only later do you find that you guys are very compatible and become good friends...(i can name a few)...I find that these friends will be the ones you'll get along with the most and share most of your thoughts, happy and sad moments with.  Why? because YOU decided to "upgrade" (that sounds bad...but lemme explain) this aquaintance/friend to a higher level of importance to you...as your FRIEND/good friend.  The relationship here is truly unique and very personal.      I don't recall when I've actually did DEEP thinking about things and people around me...i guess this will lead to many other questions i'll ask myself...on a more frequent basis.  My weekend was alright.  The Alliance Party SUCKED...i have never felt so claustrophobic (surrounded by FOBS in a club playing Chinese music...NO...NEVER AGAIN)...at least in Taiwan the locals danced to OUR music...R&B...Hip Hop.    Angela's Party on Saturday was good...i had fun, my first time @ take one...the lucky girl got TWO bouquets of flowers...keke...I hope she had a blast, cuz i had fun >_  Sunday, I spent the day with my parents...went to yorkdale (bumped into one of the three musketeers and his GF)...then we went to T&T supermarket (bumped into Allan there)...wow, it was just a day full of bumping into EAS people...T&T reminds me of Taiwan's SOGO's food court...but they don't have Capalina Ice Cream :o(

       Didn't have to go to my first class today, so I decided to sleep in and woke up at 10:00am.    I went to lab at 1:00pm and then to the forum, put on by one of my teacher's husband (a '95 alumni...weird eh?) Got lotsa free stuff at the forum (greedy me...keke).  One of my roommates and I decided to clean our suite...it looks spic and span now...lets see how long this will last...I will have to say that SOME people just like leaving their shit around for others to pick up after them...I WILL ONLY WASH MY DISHES!! (had to get that out...yes, I feel much better now :o> )

       I came back today and found out that FISHY died...he apparantly died Friday, but my roommates decided to leave it sitting on the table until I came back to say good-bye to it?!?...it looked pretty nasty...!   Also, the cover to my light fell?!?...so cheap!! I got one of the RAs to fix it for me...took him AWHILE to fix it.    Went to BBT with Danbee, Flora and Mitch on sunday night...i think destiny's service need major improvement...much too slow and they dun even know the items on the menu?!?   Suzanna got exempted from Optics...she won't be coming to school on Mondays :o(...i guess daddy/mommy will have to drive my ass back into Barrie from now on ~~

       I was bored outta my mind today...i watched every movie in my computer...then we (my roommates and i) decided that we can't stay in the suite any longer...we decided to go out to a nearby bar and play pool...we waited for one of them to come back from a friends place and we headed out for pool...as most people already know, I SUCK!! but we had fun...we even picked songs from the juke box (BRITNEY SPEERS) to piss the other people off...lol, i worked!!...we're gonna make this a weekly outting...let's see how long this will last.

       Woke up today at 8:30, showered etc. and headed out for my 10:00 class around 9:40...walked past the first parking lot (um...why is there so little cars parked in the lot this morning?!?)...then I was stopped by a man in his car, he told me that the SCHOOL IS CLOSED for the whole day due a POWER OUTTAGE!!...what the _ _ _ _??  I didn't believe him at first, so I asked another lady at the parking lot (prob a teacher, she was old)...she told me the same story...so I walked back to res. Everyone is bored outta their minds...there's nothing to do, NOT EVEN HOMEWORK...besides my textbook is in my locker at school.

       Got home on thursday around 4 ish...i headed out to hand out my resumes...i want a part-time job for the weekends, basically i'm looking in my field.    I went downtown Friday, met up with Bonnie and went for a facial...i haven't had one in a very long time (before Taiwan).  Later on that night we had a family dinner, cuz my cousin came back from HK to visit for two weeks.  I went over to her place after dinner, but we just ended up watching TV and TRIED to plan out our day for Saturday (didn't happen tho).    The six girlies decided to take THE GROUP picture again.  We got to the place late, but the lady was nice and took our pics anyway.  I thought last year's pic was nicer, but ah well...We then headed to Milestones for dinner.  We waited soooo long for our table, but during the wait we managed to get a small booth downstairs and swish three butts on each side...hahaha, and we enjoyed our appetizer and fish bowl bellini...yum-yum.  Dinner, was good, a lot of chit-chat and catching up...a lot of picture taking and laughing.  Then we decided to go K...but everywhere was booked :o(...so we went home, where my mom made us dessert.  I hope shopping was good for you girls...we should go out again (for K) before Julie leaves.

Friday:  I  went to a house warming party...had a feast there, sushi, lobster, mango pudding...yummy!!

Sunday:  Went to lunch @ Nagoya for Trish's b-day...lotsa sushi...yummy, yummy...she didn't like her gift tho, but I liked it...hahaha, that's alrtie she had the gift reciept.  I went to Atlantis that night with Alex + two of her friends, Judy + two of her friends, Bren and Jo...again, Chris bailed on us...I actually had fun this time...CBCs + RnB = good time...hahaha.

       Yesterday i went shopping with shirley, heena, jessica and her sister (since jessica brought her car up this week).  We now have "Opticianry Uniforms"...hahaha, backpack + rain jacket.    We got out of lab early yesterday so a group of us chilled at the cafe until forum began...we had many laughs, doing imitations and bringing up werid people in our class...keke.  Olga and I also recruited people from our lab to go to fitness class and work out at the fitness center with us tomolo!!  Today's lab went by fast too, we were out before 11:00am.  Actually, I was done by 10:30am.  Tina, Olga, Inga and I headed to the computer lab...but of course we HAD to hit Timmy's before that...we didn't end up going to the lab...we had our coffee and chatted in the cafe until 12:00pm (pilates class).  Melissa joined us for the pilates class too.  After that we headed up to the fitness center for some cardio and weights.  I went to the computer lab to work on "Hard Copy", while Olga checked her email.  Then we headed back to rez.    Tonight: (1) Optics Study Notes (2) Bachelor @ 9:00pm (3) pack

       Came back to Barrie this morning about half an hour before class started.  One of my roomies brought a cake back from Etobicoke, thinking it was b-day today (isn't she sweet?).  Well, since my b-day isn't until next week, we decided to cut the cake anyway (cuz it's can't sit for a week...what the heck, we won't let it!!) It was DELICIOUS...it's a chocolate truffle cake from a bakery in Etobicoke called THE ROSE GARDEN...their cakes are as good, if not better than MAXIM CAFE.     Had fun this weekend...I shopped (ghetto style) with my cousin, surprised danbee on her b-day @ demetres and I went to the HostEx food and hospitality show (lotsa free food and alky).  I also started to knit a scarf...yes, ME knit a scarf...lol.  My mom finally got her new car, after a three month wait...it's nice, I like it >_

       Yesterday after forum, I went over to Olga's to dye her hair (preparing for the extensions).   We chilled for a couple of hours (when we should have been studying!!), it was fun looking at her pics...seeing how much she has changed.    Today after lab, I went to pilates with Melissa and Inga (the rest of the group had other things to do).  I came back to work on my essay.  Then we headed to the mall around 7:00 to pick up some stuff and made it back before 9:00 for "The Bachelor" (there was NO way we were gonna miss it!!).  Olga finally called me; Jodie and I went over to her place to check out her half-done hair...she's gonna get the rest in tomolo...it looks good, but i dun like how she got her nails done in RED...I think it'd look much nicer if her nails were done in french manicure, which would look awesome with her dress for the wedding.    Planning for saturday is coming along...thanx Doris for getting the info and helping us out.

       My parents drove me back this morning...we actually got back earlier this week than the last.  I went to the two hour optics class, learned about vergence...which is the same as lensmakers equation...then I had my Optics test...I thought it was quite straight forward, i'm waiting for my mark now.  Gonna go work out at 5:00 with Olga.  Thanx for the presents girls, you know who you are...you'll see me using it often :o)

      I have a test on Monday, but somehow, I feel that my time shouldn't be wasted on studying (this test should be rather easy...like gr.12 physics)...but then again i shouldn't say this before the test, ah-well.  I went to Magic Hills Haunted Adventure today in stouville with Suzanna, Raymond, Judy, Juivette & their friends (I would write out all thier names if only I could remember them all...hahaha, I think I only remember four...my bad.)  Suzanna, Raymond and I only did two attractions, while the others did three.  We headed for the Black Cavern first, followed by the Trek Trail...the line was sooooo long for the trail (and it wasn't scary).  We all assumed that maybe the actors were tired, it was a long night.  We got there around 9:30pm and left around 1:30am...no joke.  But I had fun, the Black Cavern was good, chatting through the line, making fun of people etc.  We definitely need to hang out more often.

       After lab today, Olga and I had to talk to our co-ordinator, so we went to find her.  She was doing the College Contacts...so I went and acted as a patient for the second years...it was fun, i have to go back next week with Olga (cuz i made her get fitted for contacts too) in order to get our trial pair of contacts.  After that, we headed to the gym to workout.  During lab and at the gym we were talking about going to watch "The Ring" or "Ghost Ship" (we just wanted to get scared) so we finally decided to go and see a matinee movie.  After much fuss (recruiting people to come to the movies), Mo, Mo's friend, Minh, Shaun, Sherly, Olga and I, went to see "The Ring" (but the 7:10 show).  We went to a really ghetto theatre...i didn't know it was that BAD, or else i would have suggested the Cineplex @ Molson Park.  The movie wasn't scary at all; it just had some ugly faces pop up once in a awhile (Olga and I had more fun watching Sherly!!...lol).  After the movie we split with the guys and headed to A&P to pick up a cake for Jessica, since her b-day was yesterday (no one knew).  We went back to the student residence and surprised her with the cake...bad timing, she was moving her furniture around!!...we all had some cake, then Sherly and I headed back to Olga's to watch "The Bachelor" (we taped it!!).  Before we watched the tape, they girls made chocolate banana croissants (yummy!).  Gwen got kicked off...which confused all of us.  Can't wait to see the next two week's episodes.  A fun weekend: Friday - interview #1 + THE FANNIES Saturday - nothing yet Sunday - Lion King Musical

       Let's see, where should I start?  My weekend was a BLAST!  Thanks to all those who showed up, stopped by on Saturday.  Although we had a changed of venue cuz Monop was being stupid...we still had a great time at Emcee.  We had a great turn out...31 people I think.  I had lotsa fun...saturday night was the perfect example of "a small world"...somehow, you'll show up some where and meet someone you know...lol, Ramond & William, Raymond & Carman, Ada & Susanna, Jenny & Lillian, Ria's friend...yeah, small, small world.  Everyone mingled well, I wanna definitely do this again.    I wanna thank Doris for her home-made cake, and all the trouble we put her through (cashier)...you're the best.  I give props to Mitch and Danbee, for singing (thanks >_ _  Thanks trish for stopping by and dropping off the "Lion King" tixs...(although she has a test to study for); bren and I kinda knew because YOU and JO have communication flaws...hahaha.  Thanks girlies: Trish, Bonnie, Judy, Flora, Mon and Jen...It looks like the coming weekend I'll be pretty busy too (Dinner on thurs, FANNIES on fri, Lion King on sun).    Thanks for all the presents guys (you guys know who you are); I like every gift I recieved this year (all very entertaining/usefull) :o)  I also wanna thank Tony for the "DIM CHURN", yes, we did listen to the show...(but that wasn't the song i wanted to hear!!).  You played a lot of OLD songs (but i actually know them...hahaha)  I went to Belanna's 2-year-old party on Sunday...that kid is TOO cute!  On the other hand, I had a test today...yes, judging from the fun I had over the weekend, I didn't do much studying.  I don't think I did too well on the test, waiting for my results now.

       feeling: bored update: 5 more days until graduation  Interesting day today...had my techniques test today...it was easy.  Then i went to College Contacts for my fitting.  There were a lot more people there today than last week.  I saw Ellen there, she told me that Lisa said that she was gonna hire me for the Sundays, just as I have requested...but she hasn't called me yet :o(.  At the lab I also saw someone familiar...then, she made eye contact and said "hi"...hmm, i went over to her and started talking to her...OMG, it is HER, Melissa De Jesus...a girl from my HS!!  I was soooo surprised to see someone at Georgian that I actaully knew!!  She was sooo surprised too, she's actually a second year; i guess she didn't finish up at York...but yeahm co-winky-dink right?  I was such a hard patient to fit...Kevin got them in, but it took a lot of tears...taking the contacts out was much more difficult though...i couldn't stop laughing (all Olga's fault!).  They also made a boo-boo...they ordered the wrong axis for my right eye; i'll be going back to see them next week.    Susanna, Olga and I decided to skip Jean's class so we left after the contact lab.  Susanna and I headed for Krispy Kremes at Hillcrest.  We had a long and interesting talk in the car...we really should have these talks more often, analyzing matters really make you think...not just about the issue at hand, but life in general.    I will be job shadowing at the Optometrist office tomorrow...i hope everything goes well the first day.  Then i'm gonna fly downtown for my grad photos (i really hope these turn out good)...my weekend is still undetermined...but I do have to set aside a couple hours to go over my notes, i have a test Monday (yes, the same day as my convo). >_

       feeling: tired and cheated update: 6 more days until graduation reminder:  never let someone who isn't going to the movie PICK the movie!!  Lab and forum went fine-and-dandy today.  Actually, Olga and I skipped the second half of forum and headed to the gym; since we were planning on studying before we catch the movie tonight with the others.  After we left, Essilor ordered pizza in for the whole class...yeah, boo for us :o(  I went back to rez to shower and have dinner before I went over the Olga's...a quick tutoring session took place (don't really think she got everything i told her...but anyway) then we headed over to the student rez to meet up with the guys.  Luckily, I was talking to Sherly before we decided to leave to meet the guys in the lobby; cuz they were OUT..."grocery shopping"....lol.  We hung out in the second floor common room, the uys had a couple of drinks, then headed to the movies.  Why do I feel cheated?...here it comes: don't watch "the ring" or "femme fatale"...both are stupid movies..."the ring" wasn't scary (watched it last week)...and "femme fatale" was just STUPID!...a total WASTE OF MONEY!...TINA, chose the movie and she ended up NOT going!!  Mo was right, another movie to add to "our (stupid) movie list".  Tina will be hearing an ear full from Olga and I tomorrow...this will be interesting...

       feeling: bored update: 7 days until graduation (November 18th) tentative: opticianry pub night  I'm gradually catching up with my taiwanese soap operas...keke...seriously, after watching two whole movies (i'm on my third one now), i really don't think there are guys like these male actors in real life (it's all made-up).  Where can i find a sensitive, caring (not-bad looking...lol) guy??...if anyone has the slightest clue, lemme know >_

       Came back on Thursday for jo's family b-day dinner @ Nagoya...imagine a 20+ party in there...yes, it was chaos; we couldn't even sit in the back room, cuz we wouldn't fit!  I bumped into a guy from my program there...it was weird...i called susanna to tell her...keke.    Friday: I went to my first interview of the weekend...it went well, I will have to job shadow for two-three fridays to see how things are before the doctor's decide if they'll keep me or not.  Later on that night, I went to the KISS 92 FANNIE AWARDS with bren, jo and my cousin, jen.  It was gay...i was soooo deaf coming outta the ACC, kids these days are sooooo loud!!  I would have to say that IN ESSENCE was the best, followed by Sean Desmond's performance.    Saturday: I drove up to Newmarket for my second interview of the weekend @ UCC Mall.  It was funny cuz when I got there, I just started talking to this girl I knew who worked there...it totally didn't occur to me that the manager was in the back room waiting for me...lol.  I would have to say that this interview went extremely well, the manager is sooooo nice (just like Ellen told me she was).  That afternoon, I got a call from Lenscrafters, asking for an interview...i will be meeting the manager next saturday...If everything works out, i'll be working at the optometrist place on fridays, Lenscrafters on saturdays, and in newmarket on sundays.  I will be able to experience all aspects of an optical dispensary :o) .  Saturday was also Jo's b-day, we didn't really celebrate with her...we just took her out to dinner and then she went out with her co-workers for the night.  Bonnie was so sweet, she came over to drop off Jo's gift...it was just what she wanted (red mittens >_  Sunday:  Went out with the family for Dim Sum this morning...there were sooo many people; I normally go on saturdays, not sundays...i was surprised that there are crowds on sundays too.  I would like to thank bonnie, flora, jen, judy, mon, trish (and jo), for the Lion King Tixs...it was really good; the masks were sooo pretty, the whole musical was much different from the traditional ones...the performers go in the crowd with the props/masks...sooo cool.  I recommend this musical to everyone...better go watch it before it leaves >_    I have posted some pics from last weekend's karaoke and from this thursday.  Please send me your pics, since my camera had minimal memory :o(

      feeling: hungry   I just came back from a STEP class; it was such a good workout, i felt my muscles getting tired after each rep we did!  Lab today was hectic: former making, frame aligning (to fit a customer), measuring PD on the glasses itself and neutralization.  But the funny thing was that most of us got Gary to align our glasses for us...lol.  Convocation went well yesterday...my parents and grandma did not fall asleep during the ceremony, although the people behind them did!!  Many stopped by for pictures (thanx guys.... >_  I would like to thank Doris again for her flowers; you're always so creative and "small-hearted" (get it?).  I would also like to thank my sisters for bringing back many childhood memories (cheerbear!!).  And then there's Bonnie, who under my sister's persuasion ended up staying for the ceremony and dinner afterwards (luckily you don't have school the next day).  I think my parents were the happiest of all last night...you could see my mom and dad beam with joy; they wanted to be in every picture!!  I was happy, but i think i got over the "exciting stage"...i think i was happier when I found out that i have completed all my program requirements and that i would be able to graduate in November!!...lol (many of you have heard my stories).  I am living proof that it can happen!  Oh, and my bouquet of flowers turned out to be very pretty.  My mom went and order yellow roses; i asked for lilies after she had already ordered them...so, i thought i wouldn't like it...but they turned out very nice; definitely could go back to that florist for bren's flowers in june.  Now i can't wait until everyone else graduates in the spring/summer convocation!

       feeling: excited update: tomorrow is graduation!  Yesterday's accumulation of snow has blanketed my driveway...and of course we have not found a company to shovel our driveway yet!!...my mom was going crazy trying to find the company that shoveled our driveway last year to come back...but they no longer do residential areas anymore.  My dad did a little shoveling this morning, then Jo, my grand-uncle and I did a bit more in the afternoon.  Just when I was getting tired, my dad comes out and tells us to stop shoveling, he has just found a company!!...YEAH...lol, by that time we only had half the driveway done, not even enough for bren to get the RAV back into the garage.    I went downtown on Friday for grad photos and to pick up extra convo tixs (they only gave me one)...oh well, i guess my grandma will have to join my parents in the two hour boring ceremony...my sisters and cousin are gonna meet up with me afterwards for pics.  I also met up with Bonnie at eaton center, we chatted a bit and i had lunch with her.  Then at 1:00 I met up with jo and walked to Le Bitheque to meet Bonnie (another one) for lunch again, i ended up ordering an appetizer...it was soooo oily, i felt sick afterwards...i didn't eat dinner after i got home :o(    I went for another interview on Saturday @ Lenscrafters...they told me i was hired and that they'd call me later on in the week to see what day i'm gonna start and what hours i'd be working...i will have to wear a dark business wear/suit, if I choose not to then i would have to order Lenscrafter gear (uh, no thanx!).    My parents are telling me not to go back to Barrie for my test tomorrow at 12...but i think i want to go back for it; it should be easy and I don't wanna to take it after everyone else.  The thing is, I would have to come back out after the test and then drive downtown by 5:00.  I hope the weather gets better; the snow will melt, there would be no ice, so that my drive up and down would be good tomorrow >_

      feeling: thirsty  I came back to Barrie with Olga on Sunday night (a first for me, i usually come back on Monday mornings).  My weekend was relaxing.  I got home on thursday...the flowers were back in a bouquet (long story...), i watched TV practically the entire night: friends, survivor, followed by will & grace.  I read over two sections in dispensing theory; if i brought my text home, i would have been able to do section 16...but of course, it's heavy so it stayed at rez.    Friday, i went to the optometrist's office and job shadowed for the day.  Tom, one of the licenced optician, was very nice, he taught me a lot.  They actually have a lot of people coming in and out...one of my teacher's father-in-law came in for an eye examination and glasses.  Then my HS friend's family came in to pick up glasses...that was weird...my friend's mom was like "Ada?...hi, Ada!"...yeah, i was embarrased!  Saturday, I went to lunch with my family, came home and took a long nap (i had to wake up early).  Then bren and i went to pick up a gift and headed to Swiss Chalet to celebrate Shalini's b-day.  The food was yummy and the prices were good (haven't had swiss chalet in...ummm, about 10 years, i'm serious!).  Then we headed home to do work...well, bren did work...i watched TV...lol.  After lunch yesterday, i went out to buy groceries (Jo came with me).  Then Morgan came over to fix our computer...it's infected with viruses...it took him a long time...he thinks they're gone...but we still can't print (text becomes jibberish) or check mail.  He said it might be a ROGER'S problem...but we dun wanna call them and deal with them...bad experience from the past...so , i guess we're gonna leave it the way it is and see what happens with the computer in the next few days, hopefully it'll get better.

       My fabrication lab exam yesterday went well.  I finished in less than an hour.  We headed over to Olga's to study after the exam.    We decided to order pizza...I had the most difficult time ordering pizza in Barrie...WTF, people here are RETARDED!!  They don't know how to use their computers to check to see which location is closest to you, they ask YOU which one is closest...how the hell would i know?!?  Then they tell me there isn't a time guarantee?!?...i asked "Why not?"...the answer: "i dunno, the computer says there isn't a time guarantee"...SO STUPID!  Then when the pizza arrives, it's soggy in the middle...so I call back to complain.  They were willing to send us our order again (or give us a $7 credit, for our $21 order...ummmm, i'll take the pizza)..they told us not to eat from the original order anymore because they were gonna take it back?!? (well, we were hungry...so we ate like half of each side!)  Then when the delivery person came...we showed her the pizza...she said "Oh, it's because you ordered mushrooms and THEY make the pizza soggy."..Ummm, missy, I always order mushrooms on my pizza and it is never soggy...at least not in TORONTO!  So we had two more pizzas to eat (it became our study food).  After this pizza fuss, we actually manage to get studying done.  I finished the Optics workbook (had a lot to catch up on), over some chit-chat, Y&R, pizza and chocolate.    My interent at home still doesn't work :o(

      My first lab exam today was alright...i couldn't align the friggen frame!!...the hinge was broken, i'm sure it was, the screw wouldn't screw in!...besides that component i think i did fine with the former making and the lens gauge sections.  Tomorrow I have my fabrication lab exam...i'll let you all know how i do on that one :o).    After lab today a group of us met up at Timmy's and chatted over our coffee and snacks.  We realized that we have a whole lota shit to study for for Jean's class!!...then i went through the theoretical optics workbook and realized that there's about 30 pages of questions to do and fill in...OMG!!  I really have to get going...we set tomorrow as group study day...let's see how that goes.  My roomies and I switched our Secret Santa presents today...we couldn't wait until tomorrow night (which was the date we set earlier).  Well, Jodie was correct..the person each of us had, in turn had us...Heena & Sarah, Jodie & Steph, Pam & me...Pam got me Winnie the Pooh slippers (the ones with the heads on the front of puffy slippers...lol)...they are extremely warm...i'll have to jack down the heat in my room.    7 more days to go until Christmas break (including exams >_  I have added a comment section...keke...thanx for the help girlie >_   urlLink ">Comment

       This is gonna be a long update...  All last week was spent preparing for the "Optical Ball"...although I really didn't need anything (cuz i already had a dress etc) I went to the mall three days that week with Jodie to help her pick out a dress.  I bought a pair of shoes to go with my dress, but that was all (only $40).  Jodie was sooooo cute; we found a dress at Reitman for only $70...it looked really nice on her.  Then she fussed about where she should get her hair done on thursday; i helped her solve that problem also, by asking melissa to book an appointment for jodie at her salon...>_  We made pre-dinner plans with some others...we met at Olga's place around 5-6ish (i got there at 6:15)...we had a couple of drinks and then headed to the Lions Club (yeah, ghetto)  Some of us got lost on the way over there...a few phone calls later, everyone was located and redirected with the correct directions to the hall.  The dinner/dance was ghetto...the food was horrible and the bar sucked (only order beer...everything else tasted NASTY!).  After the draw and the christmas carol (sooooo gay); the DJ starting his thing.  When he finally decided to play R&B and Hip Hop, us girlies hit the dance floor...that dance floor was very empty...kinda made me (and others) feel naked...cuz usually at clubs you'll feel people dancing around you.  Since Olga was driving me home, I had to leave with her...she was gonna drop me off at markham and then hit "My Apartment" with her cousin.  I surprised my family getting home that night, since they were expecting me home the next morning.  Thanx to Eric, no one got spot checked...he called to warn all of us about the police...keke.  Friday, I worked at the Optometrist office again...much better this week; i got to deliver glasses, adjust etc.  Saturday was spent shopping, lunch with grandpa...etc.  Sunday, I went to work for the first time at Shorney's...it went well, not as busy as the optometrist office, but i was able to adjust frames, learn the computer software etc.  Ellen was great...i was her shadow for the day..she taught me most of the stuff i have to know...thanx girlie >_  I called Olga on Sunday again for a ride back up.  Well, since she's such a good bud, she came up to get me :op...Nina came up this week too.  We got back to Barrie around 1:00am...the funny thing is that everyone was asleep by the time i got back...they were sooo surprised to see me the next morning...keke, i have great roomies >_  Wondering how this week will go...i have two lab exams...then my two theoretical exams next monday and tuesday.

       Finally it's Christmas Break!!....yeah....I am officially back in Toronto now >_  My optics exam today was easy.  I didn't study last night nor this morning...but i should say that i was very productive today;  I woke up bright and early...went shopping, went back to rez for lunch...we cleaned up our suite (cuz there's an inspection when we're gone)...then i began to go over my notes for Optics.  I managed to memorize all the formulas, key numbers and my little cheat-cheat notes...IN IN OUT - OUT OUT IN - IN OUT IN - OUT IN OUT...hahaha.  I finished the exam in about an hour...left the exam room and realize i messed up ob one thing!...so dumb, but that's alright, that wasn't worth that many marks.    My mom came into Barrie to get me around 7-8 ish.  I came home, dropped my stuff on my floor (it's still where i left it)...had something to eat, watched TV and then i put up the Christmas tree...i'd have to say: it's pretty ugly and plain...i wanna make a Christmas Ornament for everyone in my family, you know the special ones with your names on it...let's see how far i'm gonna get with that idea.  I am looking forward to the Friday get together...i need to go out and have some fun...i feel as though i am deprieved of FUN.

       I went to shadow on Friday again (my last time)...but the doctor's were out at a seminar, so i didn't even get to talk with them.  Hopefully Sylvanna will relay my message to them.  I studied a bit on friday and saturday for my exams, then sunday was work (10-6) @ shorney's.  Working with Rose is definitely more relaxing than with Lisa.    I came back to Barrie this morning with Ellen (thanx for the ride!).  Had some lunch, chit-chatted with Ms. Jodie...then Olga called so we went over to her place to study >_  Had my Dispensiung Theory test today...it was alright...i guessed on a klot of the mc, but i think i did okay.  I got to school a little earlier...found a bunch of Opticianry students at the cafe...so we all hung around a bit and then headed to the exam room...the teachers were sooooo slow in setting up the room.  I finished the test with 2 hours (we were given 3 hours).  Then Jodie, Heena, Sarah and I headed to Swiss Chalet for dinner...um-um, yummy ribs.  Ellen and her roomie were there too!! (there's probably only one Swiss Chalet in Barrie...hahaha.)   Ms. Jodie had an overall BAD day today...missing questions ont he test, losing her earrings!...(but luckily, we found them back).  Then we came home and chilled...Olga came over...we scanned pics, called other people, basically we just wasted time...etc...etc.  I do have another exam tomorrow at 4:15...but somehow i'mnot worried about it now...i'll update tomorrow again >_

      Well i guess this is my first update since i've been back.    First thing,  i only got to sleep in twice, since i got back!!  I end up waking up early to run errands for my parents, drive my grandparents around or for something else.    Last week was quite productive: shopping for Christmas presents, going out with Opticianry friends and high school friends.  On friday I went to Milestones with a couple of Opticianry friends.  We were suppose to hit a club afterwards, but they all bailed (some were tired, others just weren't in the mood)...so, bren and i decided to meet up with flora, mon, wen and theresa and we ended up at Red Square (cuz there was no cover, while Pearl required a $12 cover).  It sucked...i was not a good start to my "Christmas fun", i'm definitely not going to go back there.    Saturday, i went to Milwalkies for Viv's B-day.  It was a lot of fun seeing my high school friends, we usually only get to see each other twice-four times a year (yeah, b-days only)...we really need to make an effort to get together more often.  After dinner we went upstairs to the bar area for $2 shots (only on certain ones tho)...i really liked the chocolate mint one!  Everyone (including myself) was buying Viv drinks after drinks...the poor girl had about 8 shots within a half hour!!  Judy and Bren really wanted to go to Tonic (but i wasn't dressed to go...urgh). But, they managed to talked me into going (after judy offered me her top, instead of my turtle-neck sweater)...we headed over to Tonic at 11, Andrea came with us too. I really think that Tonic has the best crowd on Saturdays...but we ended up leaving early cuz bren and i both had to work the next morning.  I think we're gonna go clubbing as a group again sometime this week...@ JOE it think.  Sunday, after work i headed out to dinner for my Dad's b-day...we got him a new cell phone (Motorola V60).  Monday, i went to Karaoke with bren and some of her pharm friends...i think that's the cheapest i have ever paid for karaoke, it was fun.  Then i went out for chinese dessert with Angela, Bonnie, Cece and Doris.  We had many laughs.  Bonnie hopefully you won't be a chipmunk in pain tomolo....same to you jo! (>_

       The first week back at school has been interesting.  I start bright and early Monday mornings at 8:00am with my Dispensing Lab, followed by my fabrication Lab later on that afternoon.  Monday was also Sherly's b-day.  A couple of us took her out to dinner at Casey's, followed by ice cream cake back at Jessica's rez...she was sooo surprised we did so much for her.  We watched Joe Millionaire at Jessica's place since there was no way i was gonna get back to my place in time for it...it was funny...I really think those girls are soooo stupid!  I espeically despise HEIDI.    Unlike Mondays, Tuesdays I get a later start in the day...starting at 1:00pm, Intro Ophthalmology for three hours!...Everything Gary talked about today, I have already studied either in HS or Uni which was good.  But this class is seriouslly very long and boring!  Then I had an hour of Pratice Management.  An interesting course, it's actually more work than i think it to be.  We have to create a plan for our own dispensary...yeah, you think that's easy...NU-UH!  On Wednesdays I only have one class, Practice Management for two hours.  I headed to the gym to renew my membership, went for a brief fitness analysis, then worked out for about an hour with Inga...Tina bailed!  Next Wednesday I'll go through the full fitness analysis and tests, then I'll get a fitness schedule set up for me...this is all FREE by the way...part of the membership.  I headed to the mall with Olga, Jodie and Pam...picked up a couple of things...mainly Vicks for Pam...then we headed back cuz Pam had a night class at 7:00pm.  I went over to Olga's...her cousin trashed her place over New Years...I was nice enough to help her clean up some of the mess...she still has plenty to clean when she comes back on Sunday.  Then i came back andwe had our BACHELORETTE marathon!...I think Trista has a great range in taste for men...I wanted her to keep Billy (the firefighter)...but oh well, I'm rooting for Jamie, Ryan and Brian now.  Did you see the Tiffany bracelet Russel tried to buy his way to Trista?...it worked though...hahaha.   Today Contact Lab was boring...I learned how to WASH MY HANDS!...urgh...anyways.  Luckily, on my way back to rez I bumped into someone in my program...he's getting a ride home with a friend, so he's gonna come by and get me too.  All my possible rides home all have Thursdays off...and everyone else who drives lives in sauga, and I'm kinda outta their way.  I have to find a solution to this soon...>_

       Didn't get a chance to update during the holidays besides the last, so here's basically what happened over the break:  shopping, church, annual family Christmas Dinner, relatives visting from England and Beijing, taking them out, shopping, clubbing, lunch with friends, shopping some more, dinners, clubbing, skating, movies, clubbing again, skating and ice sculptures, panorama, snow-tubing, airport, new years celebrations at a friend's condo, twister karaoke, airport, church, take-one, dinner, clubbing one last time.  I can't possibly get into the details of each and every one of these events, i just want to say that I had a fun-filled holidays, although it would have been even better if i could have met up with a couple more of friends i haven't seen in awhile.  But there's always gonna be a next time...we will have to organize something soon.  I hope everyone else had a great holidays too.

      I got back to Toronto Thursday...I got a ride from Matt this time...much better than my last ride. I came back home and saw the gift my uncle sent over from England...so cute: Paul Frank Julius robes...mine is red, since blue is obviously bren's colour.  I decided to sign onto ICQ this morning...i normally don't when I'm back here, cuz my sister's are on the computer a lot, and guess who I see...RICKY!...haha, he just got back from HK...yes, we will definitely meet up for drinks soon.  Since I was on ICQ, I decided to update peeps infos...and guess what I found...BONNIE'S BLOGSPOT...I don't recall you telling me you got one...your bro did a really nice job on your page...RN BONNIE...keke  An update in school:  I have to do a marketing project with 6 other peeps in my class...although we get along great I find that maybe working together for a group project, there may be problems...we'll see how it goes.    Skiing was cancelled last week...let's hope it's still on for this week.

        Just a thought:  1)  Why is it that some people spend a lot of their time snooping into other people's business...even if they don't know that person?...they talk about that person like they REALLY know them.  2)   Why do people talk about others for example they are this and that...but really the person saying these things is just the same...or have become so.  3)   Why do I have to pretend that I want to be a part of these sessions...cuz I really don't want to be...so I just won't show up.  I find that I have lost connections with others because I find them BORING...whenever we meet, we talk about stupidness...so-and-so are still together and you know that person...(but really I don't know that person...one person outta the group probably knows of that person).  I just choose not to show up at these little gatherings

       OMG......there's another blizzard in Barrie....night school is cancelled.  It's all white outside my windows, all I can see are faint rows of headlights heading onto the 400 South.  My friend is stranded here, cuz she can't drive in this weather....she has to call her boss to let him know she won't be at work tomorrow.

       Yesterday I got back to Barrie around 10:30pm...only to find out that I have left my duffle bag at home (in my closet!!).  Why was I so forgetful?...i dunno...my friend called me to tell me she was outside waiting for me, so I quickly grabbed the stuff I have nicely place by the door and ran out, so she wouldn't have to be waiting for me.  I didn't realize that I forgot my bag until I came upstairs to my room at rez.  The funny thing is that Olga, with bags in her hands, she headed to her apartment...only to realize that she didn't have her KEYS!!!....lol....yeah, we are both retarded.  Luckily, Susanna was very nice and picked up my bag for me from home and she brought it to me today...as for Olga, she got a spare key from the manager of the condo yesterday...and then Tina stopped by her place to get her set of keys for her this morning.    It's crazy up here in Barrie...the snow just won't stop coming down.  This morning I woke up to a sky of pure WHITE...the snow here is accompanied by heavy winds which literally covers everything in sight.  You cannot see anything outside...you have to look very hard to see the traffic lights at the corner of my street!  The snow is about mid-calf in height....i'm not exaggerating!  Luckily today I didn't have to walk to my 8:00am lab, Olga drove Jodie and I.  I can't believe that they don't cancel school in these conditions...they did however announce a cancellation of night classes for today ONLY.  This weather is suppose to continue all through the week. *umph*

       After the excruxiating pain I suffered on Sunday night and Monday (I had two labs), finally someone came to my rescue: the-one-and-only-Clair.  By the time I finally saw her on Monday she had already heard my back-pain story and was ready to help me out.  She came over Monday after her workout session (without me, of course) and gave me a massage.  Did I mention she's a professional Massage Therapist?  Well, she is.  Due to the bad weather in Barrie, she got stuck in a snow ditch on her way over to my place from the school.  Jodie, kindly offered to go out, in my place, with Olga to help push Clair outta the ditch (Jodie feel on her tooshie...hahaha).  Clair was nice enough to give me a complimentary massage...I felt a lot better after the session.  I found out that my flexibility is "zero"...for my age i should be able to touch my toes.   I was told to continue with stretches throughout the week and then go see a Chiropractor when I get back home.    Jodie, also introduced me to some really good stuff for my pain...no, no, it's not drugs...it's an "analgesic gel" called DEEP COLD GOLD (extra strength)...this stuff works like magic, it numbs the area in pain for awhile (so at least i can fall asleep).  Tuesday I felt a lot better, but the pain is still here.  I really feel the pain when I try to get up from a chair...oh yeah, it REALLY hurts...then it's take me a coupld of steps before I can walk properly again (without the limp).  Jodie's new nickname for me is: "the-senoir-citizen."  Bachelorette tonight was good and predictable...I really hate Russ...Charlie is alrite...but, I want Ryan to win in the end...and Greg is ugly!  American Idol, on Tuesday and tonight was hilarious...some of these people REALLY think they can sing...i dun think so!  Lastly, I was disappointed on Monday on Joe MIllionaire.  I wanted Allison to stay to the end...I like her...but I guess it's for the best that she's gone now, 'cuz she'll undergo less pain and humility when she finds out the truth in the end.  I really HATE Mojo and Melissa...Zora is really down-to-earth and Sara acts too much like a princess.    My mummy's gonna come and get me tomorrow, since no one can gimme a lift back to Markham :o(

       Haven't slept all night...I pulled a muscle in my right lower back...It seriously feels like I'm crippled...I can't walk...I slide instead of taking steps, it's soooo painful.   I can't sit either, the pain is unbearable (tears in my eyes)...I have to see if this continues tomorrow, I might have to go see a doctor, where?...I have no clue.

       Today was a very "tiring" day.  I woke up a little earlier to shower, have my coffee and go over my note a bit before the test (which was at 8:00am), so yeah, I was up around 6:00am.  As a mentioned at the end of my last blog, Susanna was sleeping over.  I was very nice to her, since I didn't force her to get up until 7:00 ish...way after I got up.  We headed to bed around 12:30 ish last night but we didn't sleep until 2:30 ish!!  We just kept on talking and talking in the dark, in our beds (Susanna in her sleeping bag).  Then we finally said " seriously we have to sleep or else we'll die tomorrow morning" so then we stopped talking and headed to bed.  Since I like my room very hot, my heat was turned up to 25 degrees (which is normal for me), but we already turned it down to 10 degrees after dinner yesterday night, but my room was still boiling all night!  So yesterday, for the first time, I slept part of my window cracked opened...yes, the breeze was COLD!...but it balanced out the heat in my room.....hahaha.    The test wasn't too bad, I know for sure I answered a couple of the MCs incorrectly, but I know they won't hurt me too badly.  We had a class after the test, EVERYONE was sleeping in that class; if they weren't sleeping they were day-dreaming...it was sooo bad.  Luckily, I was done by 12:00 and I could come home.  Susanna, Clair, Jodie and Olga all had lab until 3:00pm.  Susanna made up a little excuse and headed home, there was NO WAY she would have survived another 3 hr lab, based on the amount of sleep she got (she usually gets 10 hrs of sleep).  She cut her day short and headed back to Markham.    Next week we'll definitly have another gab session...cuz we have another test next week...lol  >_

      I got home last Thursday after a lot of "obstacles".  Friday morning I drove my mom to her dealership so she could get an oil change etc.  Then we went to Lake Tai for some dim-sum.   I went to the Chiropractor after lunch, she analyzed my problem, adjusted me and sent me home.  I felt funny after the adjustment...i dun think i'm gonna go back to her.  I feel a lot better from Sunday-Monday.  I think I just need to continue with some stretches and I'll be all better.    Later on Friday night, I met up with some friends and we to Take-One.  The room we had (medium) was much too small, we really had to sqwish in.  About an hour into the night, Ricky comes back from the washroom with Chris!!...you loser!...you said you weren't going out this weekend.  She came in and out for a bit through-out the night.  I'm glad Danbee and Mitch decided to stay awhile...I haven't seen them for over 3 months.  Overall, I had a good night...I only have one complaint though...I will promise myself that I will never call certain people out for K who won't give others a chance to sing...and those who always place their songs up front.  Happy Belated Birthday Olga!  I stayed home on saturday to start studying for my Contact Fitting Test on Wednesday.  Didn't get much done, but at least I started.  Sunday, after work I got a ride back to Barrie with Olga.  I came back to find that Jodie spent the entire weekend here.  Although Stevie cae up to keep her company, I still felt bad for her.    Joe Millionaire was interesting tonight.  I really wanted Melissa outta there, but MoJo was second on my list.  Melissa and Sara seem to be more and more competitive and evil...they seem likw the "evil-step-sisters" in cinderella...hahaha.  I really have to study today, I have a test tomorrow morning @ 8:00am.  Susanna is sleeping over tonight >_

       I only had two classes this entire week!!  I went to school on monday for my two labs...all was great.  Monday night, around 7:00pm freezing rain started falling from the sky (Jodie and Pam just went to the gym down the street!)  I was expecing them back around 8:00-8:30...it was 8:50 before they showed up.  They were "human icicles"  they both had a layer of frozen ice on their jackets~lol...it took them 20 mins to walk home (the gym is about less than 5 mins away)...they have to slip and slide their way home; up the little hill and down the ramp....lol    Tuesday, the school was closed to the bad road conditions.  We ALL stayed home the entire day...we were bored outta our minds...we were going NUTS!!  No one wanted to drive Jodie and I to the mall :o(   We stayed at home all day, but not one person cracked open their books...even if we had a test the next day!!  This morning I woke up with high hopes of the school being closed again...I kept on checking the school site and the VR News updates on closures...nothing!  Then finally @ 7:15am we get a call from a friend in the other rez  "Girls, the school is closed today until 12:00pm"...that means no test for us!!~lol  I went back to bed after calling a couple people up to tell them the news too.  But then the phone calls started to pour in...i even had someone drop by my place since they were HERE and the school was closed... it wasn't even 9:00am...OMG.  The rest of the day was pretty much spoent the same way as Tuesday; but today, Jodie remembered she has her PS in her closet, so we hooked that up and played for awhile.    I really wonder if school will be canceled tomorrow...it looks good outside today though...it would really be a waste of MY time if school is canceled tomorrow too...I only had one day of school this week!

       HAPPY CHINESE NEW YEAR!!  I had a very traditional weekend.  I got home Thursday and found my house nicely decorated with Chinese New Year decorations...yes, my family is into that stuff.  I watched my mom organize her red envelops...(no $5 for me mommy)...lol.    On Friday, I went DT with my mom to Over the Rainbow...there wasn't much stuff left there.  We ran a couple more errands on our way back up from DT before heading out to lunch.  Dropped by Home Depot for some quotes for my project, went grocery shopping and headed home.  At around 10:30pm, we decided to head down to the EX for the "Chinese New Year-Nian Shiu".  There was a lot of people there...saw a number of familiar faces.  I could say we "followed" Susanna downtown...lol.  Doris and Sylvia were there too "helping out" (bored outta their minds.)  My sister's friend was sooo lucky, she won free F4 tickets by spinning the wheel at some tour agency booth.  There was a lot of yummy foods there too...I bought cappucino nouggat candies...um...um...yummy!  We left around 12:30-1:00 when most people started to head out too.  Saturday, Chinese New Year was spent visiting family and friends.  Besides getting the red envelopes, I just kept eating and eating at everyone's house.  I was exhausted by the time I got home that night.    I worked Sunday.  We had a power outtage at the mall...well, it was more like a circuit outtage...half the mall had power and the others didn't.  The weird thing was that it was certain stores who had this outtage, it was very random...weird.  So Suzanne, Ellen and I sat in the dark for about 1.5m hrs (we did take turns going shopping at the stores that were still opened...lol)...but we had out doors closed since our computers were down, phones didn't work either!  The power came bakc on around 4:15pm...so we had to open the doors again for the last 45 mins of the day.  We were actually quite busy yesterday.    I went home after work to find that most of my family have already arrived for Chinese New Year dinner.  Lotsa people = lotsa red envelopes...hahaha.  There were sooo many people that the house seemed really hot...kids were running around...the older kids were trying to get dinner ready and started (it was buffet style).   I was glad that Olga wanted to go back into Barrie later tonight, since I had to stay for this dinner too.  She came to get me around 11:30pm...when the rest of the family decided to finally leave (after their game of "mahjong" and the kids, after their long chit-chats)...we got back to Barrie around 1:00am.  I was beat, after a day a work and a loud dinner party, so I headed straight to bed...bags are still packed on my floor...  This morning's 8:00am lab was cut short because the teacher was sick (he practically has no voice).  So I headed home to blog...hence, this long, long blog...hahaha >_

       I am very happy >_  I went to the mini Flora Chan concert @ Rama yesterday!!  I actually didn't have a ticket, I was just gonna steal one of the ticket's my parent's had.  I was on waiting list for the an extra ticket when I bump into a friend's mom and brother.  Since my friend's brother wasn't 19+, he wasn't allowed to enter the casino and thus could not attend the dinner and show.  He was very generous and offered me his ticket, since I was still waiting for a ticket @ 7:30 and the dinner had already started @ 7:00pm.  He then had to find his way home on a Tai Pan bus because he was not allowed to stay on the casino premises.    The dinner served that night was a typical "Chinese New Year" meal.  The dinner was accompanied by cultural performances (very boring)...I just sat there and enjoyed the complimentary wine, until FLORA CHAN came on around 8:15pm.  She was dressed casually but chic.  She spoke in chinglish a lot - she especially said a lot of "you knows?".  She joked around quite a bit, made fun of the older crowd and "their times".  My friend's mom and my mom thought she had a good voice although her chinese wasn't very good.  I was offered to go up and give her flowers, but I declined...I was embarassed to go up there...hahaha.  The good thing was that the security that night was very nice...they allowed the guests to take as many pics of her as we would like...even if you went right up to the stage or right up to HER when she came done, no one hassled you!!  I didn't get to take  a picture WITH her though since no one knew how to work my digicam :o(...but I was still very happy!!  I got back to the rez around 11:30 to find Susanna still up.  I showed her the pics I took, since she couldn't come with me.  We had some "tong siu" that my mom brought up for us before we decided to head to bed (since we had a test @ 8:00am the next day)  but we didn't end up sleeping until 1:30am, we just kept talking and talking (bad!).  The test this morning was sooooo  long.  Based on the info we had to study from, it didn't seem like she could have asked sooo many questions (some were hard/confusing).  I dunno what to expect of this test (not high for sure though)...it's alright it's only 10%.  Can't wait to go home and upload the pics >_

I suggested skiing/tubing?!? anyone interested? You guys can crash at my rez.  I'm bored right now, not in the mood to study...I have a test Wednesday.

       I'm jealous at the moment...I decided not to go and see Flora Chan today after work...bad choice...I found out from Cece that she didn't even show up until 6:00pm (I was back in Markham at that time @!#!)  Cece got to take a picture with her + she autographed it...I am sooooo jealous!  Since my Thursday class was CANCELLED! @#%...I had to wait until my mom came in to get me.  I could have been back in T.O. monday night if I had know that school was gonne be cancelled Tues and Wed...then the stupid tacher decided he was gonna cancel Thursday's lab too...I had to walk all the way to school in the cold and back!! I obviously wasn't happy about that.    I watched "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"...it's hilarious..."a must see flick"- ada...hahaha.    I went to work this morning to find that a couple of my co-workers stayed until 12:00am last night to do inventory + new pricing system.  They came back bright and early this morning @ 8:00am too...two of them had to stay and work with me today until 5:00pm.  We ended to opening the store 1hr late since the stock wasn't organized yet.  I was glad that I decided to go to work a little earlier today, so I gave them a hand too.    Work was hectic today since it was the first day of the new promotion and the pricing system has changed too...i'll get it straight by next week ;o)  8:00am lab tomorrow...nite-nite pals >_

       This week had been fun-filled...filled with laughter, jokes and some very, very tired  zombies.  Monday night's Joe Millionaire Finale was sooo predictable...i just want to find out that the criterias are for Zora and Joe in order for them to cash that check.    A bunch of us girls went out to dinner at East Side Mario's before we headed home to study for our test the next morning...that was a BAD idea...we were sooo full afterwards, many of us took a nap before studying (not me though!!).  Susanna stayed the night again and we actually studied...well, besides studying Jodie also made Susanna and I cry, that girl is too funny.  Jodie, I know you'll master the pen trick by the end of this term...we'll train yah!    Since no one is able to give me a ride home this Thursday, I HAD to find a way home myself.  Since my dad wasn't gonna be using his car on Thursday, I hitched a ride home with Susanna on Wednesday so that I would be able to drive my dad's car up for school today.  It my first time watching Bachelorette at home...it was kinda weird, since it was the final episode too.  I'm so use to my roomates and I gathering in the living area and watching the show and snacking together.  I'm sooo happy that Trista picked Ryan....he's such a cutie.  Make sure you guys watch the Reunion Episode tonight @ 8:00...Helene, Erin, Trista, Charlie and Ryan will be chatting it up!! (yeah, i'm such a geek).  Plans for the rest of the week: Thursday - autoshow Friday - HAPPY BIRTHDAY JUDY!!!           - Doris's b-day thingy Saturday - buffet anyone? Sunday - airport

       Went home this weekend...did a litle shopping + got a little studying done too (rare!).  I went to the movies with Bren and Bonnie on Saturday, we watched "The Recruit" (we were suppose to watch "Chicago"...bu tonly bad seats were left so we chose something else.)  The movie was actually good...Collin is a such a cutie.  After the movie we stopped by for some bbtea take out and headed over to Doris's place.  Bonnie, Bren, Cece, Doris and I sat around chatting, singing and getting comfy with the HUGE teddy bears >_  Work today was hectic...since when did people decide to shop for glasses on SUNDAYS?!?  I actually sold a lot today...several of my customers from last week stopped by to pick up.  I have a funny story:  Maybe about a month ago two guys (men) walked into my our store with a BIG problem (as they put it)...this guy's glasses were smushed; in every shape and form...he was wondering if there was a warranty on them still.  So I checked and found that they were covered, but I still wanted to see if I could do something with the "damaged pair".  So i asked the guys to come back in about 1/2 an hour.  After a little magic and ~15 mins time, the "damaged" glasses looked "brand new".  The guys came back after their 1/2 hour and I handed his frame back to him.    Me:  "Here's your glasses, why don't you put them on again and let me see if it needs to be adjusted." Guy:  "So you just had a new pair in the back and just put my old lenses back in here right?" Me:  "No, these are YOUR own glasses (frame + lenses)" Guy: In disbelief...takes off the glasses and looks at them (at all angles)  "Are you serious?...how'd you do it?" Me:  "Just performed a little magic."  >_  So, back to the story...this guy's friend accidently closed the hot tub cover on his glasses.  His friend thought that the lid wasn't closing tight so he gave it another push and *crack*...the glasses was severly deformed.  So I helped save this guy a couple hundred dollars that day.  The funny part is that he came back into the store today, with his wife and kids.  I didn't recognize him, but I was helping his wife and he said "Do you remember me?...I'm the hot tube guy."....hahaha.  It was sooo funny.  But he made my day, he told his wife about the "magic " I performed on his glasses...I felt as if I *really* did something amazing that day.  I think this is why I'm in this field...I like to see the immediate satifaction of a customer, when they find the perfect pair of glasses...after a slight adjustment to their glasses, which makes a heck of a difference >_  I came back up to Barrie with Ellen today, she had to go abck to Markham for her own car after work...thanx girlie...she even bought me a milkshake >_

       Reading week has been going by quickly...  Since last week's events: Autoshow, Doris's b-day gathering, chilling with family, Oriental feast, working and going to the airport...I have found many other duties to keep me occupied.    Obviously I slept in a bit on Monday, I would be crazy if I didn't jump at that opportunity.  I went out and did some errands (for me and my sister), came home, made lunch, watched some TV, came upstairs to see that Jo was still sleeping!!!  OMG, that girl needs help.  The rest of Monday was spent, bringing the computer to get fixed and shopping.    Tuesday, we drove the RAV in to get the tires rotated, since we were hearing weird noises during sharp turns.  Then we headed to lunch @ Nagoya with Chris (we had the entire place to ourselves!!!).  Since Chris skipped her only class of the day, and she didn't have to work until 5:00, I ended up going to Pacific with her and did some shopping.  Came home and helped my sister bake...ummm, didn't turn out as last times ;op  I watched WIT with Bren; tried to help her out with her assignment (I fell asleep towards the end though :op).  Today was the first day I actually opened my books (actually binder) and started to see what I HAD to do before I go back to school.  I went to Home Depot and looked at some materials to use for the project, also shopped for a stove filament and the fuse (1 out of the 4 heaters of the stove broke).  I also picked up a couple more of the ceiling acrylics so I could try and finish up the kitchen.    I was on the phone a lot today, I'm still trying to sort out my weekend...I wanna have some fun before heading back to school on Monday.

       Something STUPID happened today...I'm just starting to calm down now.  I was soooo mad/frustrated.  My day was going wonderfully until I came back here *urgh*.    Went to class (both of them, even the early one), had some lunch, stopped by the gym (I kept my promise and went everyday this week).  I even got some good news from a teacher today.  He had a close friend hiring in the Toronto area and he thought of me right away (wasn't that sweet of him??).  I just happened to walk into the Opticianry office today and he sees me, he pulls me aside to tell me the good news, then he went back into his office, pulls out his card, writes his friend's name and number down.  He told me to call the number and say that he asked me to call.  After encountering the STUPIDNESS, I came back into my room and tried to contact this person right away.  I called 4-5 times, everytime he was either in a meeting or on the other line (seriously, he can't be that busy).  I finally called again and told whoever it was that picked up that I was told to call by Terry Finkelman (my teacher), this person relayed the message and the guy finally comes on the phone.  He came on and spoke with me briefly, he realized who referred me and told me who the send my resume with ATT to a certain person.  If I get a position at the location I want, I would be able to work at this job and my old one all summer, that would be soooo cool.    I am currently flooding with emotions: anger, frustration, excitement, annoyance, the list goes on.  My only advice is DON'T COME NEAR ME, cuz I might bit your head off for no @$!# reason.  I feel a little better now, I just had to vent.

       Back in Barrie now.  I drove back here straight from work.  Today I out sold everyone...muahahaha.  It was SOOOOO busy today at the store, we almost made the weeks target, it was an impossible target.    Thursday, I went downtown with my sisters.  Visited my dentist, got my teeth cleaned *shiny and smooooth*.  Ran some errands downtown, did some shopping on Queen, then headed back to campus.  Met up with Mitch and Danbee, stopped by Gerstien (w/ Jo, she had HW to do) and Rotman before we picked up Bren and came home.    I had a great weekend, starting Friday.  Friday, a whole bunch of us headed down to Joker to support Mitch's MBTC social event.  Although we ended up going to TONIC (becuase Joker's crowd as....eeewwwwyy...lol) I had a blast, SOME people just have their own dancing style!!  Besides laughing at weirdos, amongst our group we had many funny moments.    Saturday, went to dinner @ Nagoya (yes, again) with Judy, Juivette, Anthony, Bonnie and Bren.  As Judy puts it, we are the pros at ordering.  Just to make the records clear, you DO NOT have to know how to read the chinese on the menu in order to order (JUIVETTE!!!)...english works just fine!  After dinner we headed to World Bowl for some bowling...yes, bowling...this time we only had 1 little nail accident...lol.  We had no idea that it was cosmo bowling on Sat nights...none of us were wearing white (unlike other families ALL in white!!).  Although there was a PRO amongst us, I would to say that Bren and Juivette did pretty good, one knows what he's doing and the other had NO CLUE.  We headed over to 168 for some take out and we headed back to Juivette's place to chill...umm, he has weird pets...he owns an indoor rainforest!   I'm really tired now, maybe I'll sleep early tonight, since I have to wake up early anyways tomolo....nite-nite >_

       Lab on Thursday was very interesting...Eric was "the volunteer" to be fitted with rigid lenses...Gary wasn't able to get them into his eyes...poor Eric was crying at the end of the whole "unsucessful" process!! j/k    Friday, went to dim-sum with the elders in my family...was kinda weird 5 senoirs and three 20-something year olds.  It was cool that all three of us had to time to have lunch with them all at once though.  Bren went to perm her hair...yup, she permed it, have ta see it for yourselves, I think it looks cool on her (can't see myself with a perm though, or should I say i'm not brave enough to get one!)  After that, Bren and I met up with Judy, JV and JV's friend Allan for dinner @ Dickens.  The food was yummy!...our dinner was also accompanied by a live band + singer (singing popular Chinese songs at K...lol).  After dinner we headed over to Town Center to catch "Cradle 2 the Grave" with Jet Li and DMX...it was a cool movie...there really wasn't a storyline/plot though.  The funny thing was that the theatre was filled with either Chinese ppl or Black ppl...hahaha.     I slept in Saturday morning, Jo (of all people) woke me up and asked me to go shopping with her.  She had to pick up a couple of gifts, cards and an outfit.  We went to Markville...didn't find what she wanted, then went home.  Jo went to get her hair streaked red, can't really see it though (as always...)    Work was busy today again, dunno why people are choosing Sundays to shop for glasses.  I need to find a placement for the summer very soon...I can always stay where I'm at now, but I think I prefer somewhere closer to home.  I still want to keep this job, but maybe on a part-time basis.  Have to start looking and deciding on this summer placement thingy VERY soon.

       Since I was busy finishing the Dispensing project due today, I didn't get a chance to blog when I got back here to Barrie.  The project is now FINISHED!...my group and I will only have to worry about the presentation portion now (*urgh*).    Last Tuesday we had a frame show @ TLC for us, the Opticianry students.  We got free buffet and free alky while we looked at the lastest styles of frames from SILHOUETTE, CANDY, GUESS, ADIDAS....then we had draws for free sunglasses, watches etc...i didn't win though!  We also got an extra 25% off cost for all frames...I'll be getting a pair of Silhouette's newest sunglasses, the MINIMAL X in clear crystal!!!  After all the fun and excitement we headed back to my place to study for the Practice Management test the next day.  Last Thursday, we finally had a chance to fit each other with contact lenses...guess who I got stuck with? ERIC!! j/k  He felt sooo bad that he can't put them in.  Soft contact are hard for some guys to get into their eyes, but rigid lenses are MUCH MUCH more difficult.  I was kinda nervous about him putting them in my eyes too, but I remebered the tips Susanna gave me, so in one try Eric got them in...YEAH!  Friday, I went DT with my sisters becuase I had an interview!  I thought it went pretty good, hopefully I'll get this job so I wouldn't have to travel back and forth to Newmarket over the summer.  I also stopped by to see the different temple colours for my new silhouette rimless glasses...the order was put in that day and hopefully I'll get them soon.  Later on that night, I went to a Shanghai Restaurant for dinner...yum-yum...but I was sooo full I couln't fall asleep at night!  Saturday, went to dim-sum with grandma, chris and her dad.  Then headed home, waited for bren to get off work, then headed over to Judy's place in sauga.  We hung out at her house for a bit before we headed to Hamilton for Disney on Ice.  The show was good, very cute, it was like old times again (reminicing my childhood).  We bought popcorn and cotton candy (which made me and judy feel sick!...too much sugar).  We headed back to sauga for some sushi @ Sushi-Tei...delicious!!  Since, our clubbing plans were still up in the air, we headed bak to Judy's to chill and watch some TV.  Bren and I decided to skip the clubbing plan and headed home when JV and AL left, they pointed us in the right direction and off we went back to Markham.  I was sooo tired when I got home and I didn't look forward to work the next morning.  Davis Drive in Newmarket had a major power outtage Sunday morning.  Timmy's, the gas station, loblaws, the mall...etc. was all without power!  I thought I would be able to go back to Barrie early and work on my project, but in about half-hour into opening the power came back on, the people flooded the stores...and that was my Sunday.

       It's been a while in my last blog.  A lot has happened then: SARS scare, the war, I got my glasses, ordered some more at the VISION EAST show, may be getting a new job....the list goes on.  My parents came back from their trip two weeks ago, all is well.  Currently excited about my presentation on Wednesday...it's gonna be fun, amusing and I'd say very creative.  I also have my fabrication lab exam next week, along with the las dispensing test.  Bren went for her first interview in the states...it looks good, too bad i couldn't go with her...i missed out (on shopping too!!).  Everyone is scurrying to find a placement for the summer and I'm looking for one that I really like...i like where I'm working now, the people there are extremely nice to me, I have had offerings elsewhere but declined...I'm just waiting on one place, if I get in there, I will have to quit my newmarket job.  I know several of my classmates who really want my place at my store, because it's closer to where they live.  I'll know by tomorrow....wish me luck!

       Our presentation Wednesday kicked @ss!!!......everyone was sooo impressed.....we put a lot of effort and time into our presentation, we actually rehersed it.  Today was my last day of class....i felt a great sense of relief, this year went by really, really quickly.    My parents came up to Barrie today with me to move my stuff outta my rez.  I'll go back next Wednesday and Thursday for my practical exams, then I'll give back my keys to management.    Next week will definitely be bonding time because we will all be off at our Co-ops (some in Ottawa, others in Sudbury......and of course plenty of us in Toronto) starting in May.  Some good news today regarding the hours for Co-op, we can start counting the hours we work from April 21st until our board exams, which means I'll be done my Co-op requirements really quickly!!  I have to work on the final display over the weekend, I want this one to kick @ss too....then I'll be able to rub it in group E's face......getting a lil' too competitive now.....lol. I don't have to go to school next Monday or Tuesday, so maybe I 'll meet up with some people......interrupt their studying.....keke.....let's see who will be my victims.

       I GOT THE JOB!!......working at a high-end optical will be a lot of fun for the summer.  I won't have a permanant store, but I will be able to experience the crowds of the different communities our stores are located in.  I worked on props for my presentation throughout the weekend...really looking forward to my presentation on Wednesday, I'll post more later.

       Done my practical exams!  They both went smoothly, I think I did alright on both.  Now I only have one exam left to write (Ophthalmology on Monday).      Since it is long weekend (specifically EASTER) I don't have to work on SUNDAY!!  I am planning on going down to the states (MICHIGAN) and go shopping.  I'll probably leave Friday morning and come abck Saturday or Sunday....yeah, I do realize I still have to study for my exam, but I think a day and a half will be good enough.    I am kind of glad that school is over, I am currently frustrated at some people and don't want to have to put up with them anymore.  Hopefully, my feelings towards these people will change by next year September.  I believe that having a sense of responsibility in this field is very important.  In the end you'll @#$! yourself over if you don't actually KNOW what you're doing.  This is a registered profession, there are rules that govern us, if you can't abid by them or least make an effort to do your part as a member, you'll definitely loose in the end.  I'm done venting for the day.  TA-TA  NOTE:  I put up the display Wednesday afternoon, it obviously kicked @ss once again!

       I am officially finished my first year of Opticianry!!  Last (and only) written exam was on Monday. it went alright.    Today I slept in, went and had some dim sum with my family.  I have a couple of days to relax before I start work.  My last day at Shorney's is this Sunday, I'll miss everyone there....I will come back to visit or maybe to work a day or two next semester.  Before I officially start at Josephson's I need to find out where this store is actually located and how much time it'll take me to get there.  Hopefully my 2 week training session will go smoothly so I will be able to go to another store (a closer one) and  get experience there.    Before my Monday exam, I got a chance to talk to my friend and found out some interesting stuff.....fill ya in later.  I called a friend up yesterday to see how everything was going....lotsa laughs, gotta definitely get together soon.    I have a couple more things I wanna do during my days off: 1) get a hair cut; not in length....just a more stylish hairstyle 2) go shopping and BUY some nice clothes 3) go out and have some FUN  Got some good news too.....kekeke.....you'll probably hear about it soon though.

       First day at work was a interesting...very different from my old job.  When customers come in, they are ready to spend the BIG BUCKS!!  I think I'll have to start bringing my lunch as I found out today that eating in that plaza can be quite expensive.  I can't wait to learn all that I can at HT, 'cuz I'm gonna be going to the EG store the week after long weekend and then to the BB store for the last week of May (i'll be working with Minh!!...hahaha, we're gonna have fun).  This week I have Wed off, it changes weekly, but i'll definitely have one day + Sunday off to chill.  I'll update more later.

       It has been quite awhile since my last blog.  Work has been great, learning more by the day. Next week will be my last week of training @ HT.  I'll be working @ BB on Saturday, then after long weekend I'll be at EG.  I'm really looking forward to saturday.  Besides working at the busiest store, I'm also gonna be looking forward to Montreal.  That's right, after work, I'm gonna head over to the bus terminal to catch the 4:30 bus to Montreal!!  I really hope we have a blast this weekend.    I have also joined a gym and have been GOING on weekly basis (3-4 times/week)....let's see how this routine will progress.  The past weekend was a lot of fun too.  I caught up with Bonnie, Doris, Sylvia, Cece, Angela and lastly Ricky over dinner on Friday (Mitch dropped by the day "hello!"....hahaha).  Then we headed over to my place for some MJ and K (I have the suckiest selection).  Thanks Doris for the yummy chocolate covered strawberries :Op.    Saturday was Wen's 23 b-day celebration at her place.  There were a lot of people there, Wen cooked enough food to feed an army!  Judy and I stopped by DQ to grab an ice cream cake before we headed over....everyone enjoyed that....especially Louis and Sam...lol.  Large gatherings like such are actually a lot of fun, catching up with the people you don't talk to too often and chatting with friends of friends....Wen, your friends are REALLY, REALLY nice people...lol (i really mean it) and Judy and I aren't cliquey~~  Sunday, went to the airport to get my sisters....they have somewhat of a tan....I'm determined to join that 2004 grad cruise next year....I'm gonna start saving money now!...i mean it!...lol  Many laughs....and many more to come...ta-ta for now.

       My long weekend was a blast!  I had work Saturday...but I was able to get off earlier and headed straight to the bus terminal where Bonnie was waiting in line to board the bus.  We got to Montreal earlier than expected, and after a couple of phone calls, Mon and Teresa came to the bus terminal to get us.  We headed back to the residence to drop off our stuff, then headed out to get something to eat and grabbed some drinks.    Obviously, we slept in the next morning...(but so did Judy et al.)  We went out and walked around the McGill campus, took some pics then headed to Nickels for brunch.  Shortly after that we went to the SAQ to get akly for later on that night (+ the wine for dinner), then we headed back to the rez to put the drinks in the fridge and off we went to explore Old Montreal.    We basically "followed" people to the destinations we wanted to get to....the old man....the little kid...lol.  We took many funny pics along the way (the old man on skates).  We also discovered that Mon and Bonnie are long lost twins (o>_  After asking many people for directions, we finally found our way to the restaurant for dinner.  We were even EARLY (a word which does not usually exist in my book....nor the others)  Judy, JV et al, along with Dora and Yao joined us for dinner.  Dinner was delicious...but extremely slow.  Dessert was de-li-ci-ous!!  I would have to say that only the wine "WE" (me, Bonnie, MOn and Teresa) chose was yummy...the other stuff that JV and Judy brought was gross...(well, the merlot was alrite)    After dinner, 6 girls + 1 guy headed back to rez, in a small Corolla to change and pre-drink.  We got outta rez within 20 mins and headed straight for the club.  I had a blast that night: all the dancing, laughing and *ahem*  "picture taking of obscene couples" ~ We definitely have to party it up again.  Thanks to our new friend, Yao, who drove us around and took us to eat at Chinatown after the club.  He had work the next morning @ 10am but he was still willing to spend more time with us, watch the sunrise with us...which he did, while he was driving us back to rez...lol.    Thanks again to the Montreal-ers: Dora, Rob and Yao...who made this trip memorable and of course the Toronto group: Bonnie, Mon, Teresa, Judy, JV (+ Allan and Andy).  This trip was definitely worth the 7 hr bus ride there and back!  (This trip was cost efficient too!)

       It's been sooooo long since I updated.  Many things has happened since: The "Alain Mikli" show @ work, dinners and parties with work friends, HS friends, UT friends....the list goes on.    I think I have been partying way too much recently.  I met a lot of new/old people.  Friends of friends, who I know firends of....complicated right?  For example, I went to a friend's dinner party on Friday, there wasn't much mingling since there were soooo many groups of people there.  But amongst the five of us, we had a blast.  I found out that I actually know Carolyn's cousin from wayyy back when I was in elementary school.  After the dinner we headed over to chill at Florance's house.    Saturday after a long day of work, I headed out to a house party (actually it was at a party room in a condo).  Carolyn invited us to go after yesterday's dinner.  I knew I was gonna see a lot of people I actually know there since it was sorta like a mingling of two high schools.  Anyway, so of course we didn't go early (cus we are always late) and since Carolyn didn't turn on her phone we didn't actually know which condo it was....som we went around to a couple and asked...lol (not me, Florance did).  We found a cute boy outside of one, I told Bren I thought he was cute....then Florance jumps back into the car after asking hima question and she starts saying that that boy wassooo cute.  Ummm, the car door was still half opened!!    By the time we found the place, we knew for sure it was the right place.  Jerms was outside of the building chatting on his cell.  It was great seeing all these people from HS again.  We chatted up a storm, acted like total loosers and has a great time.  We definitely have to do this again.  We need to have a McGiveny reunion...someone's gotta plan it.  Some of the people there that night have changed....but i'd have to say everyone changed for the better.    I guess I really don't have to go OUT to have fun....house parties are just as fun  >_

      Is it over yet?  Yesterday's blackout was scary!!  You guys should have seen the crowds on the streets downtown.  It was soooo chaotic!! I managed to walk all the way to Chinatown from Bay & Bloor and hitched a ride hom from there.  I had to meet my sister there, since she was working at Bay & King.  Luckily, she went for a stroll in the afternoon or else she would have been stuck, high up in her building.    Everyone got home safely....some took longer than others, but that doesn't matter.  I am just glad I don't live in an apartment, since many had to take the stairs home.  When i got home, there was already a candle lit dinner on the table waiting for me (j/k).  I quickly showered (since, water was suppose to be scarse too) and then just sat around and talked with my family.    I couldn't sleep all night though....worried about many things:  how's grandfather doing, is there work tomorrow, will we have enough food for tomorrow if this continues, the alarm wouldn't shut up.....  I was surprised to see so many kind-hearted Torontonians: directing traffic, offering rides home to the elderly or anyone hitch-hiking on the streets (i witnessed 3 cases of hitch-hiking).  I would like to give all those poeple a hand-of-applause....they really made the chaotic day a much better one of those in need.

      Wow......i am finally gonna update this thing!.....excited now aren't you all?  First of all my manager let me get off early today....for no particular reason, which was very nice of her.  I got home by 5:45 ish.  So I have a little time on my hands....and so, I decided to update.    Lots have been going on....let's see if I can get it all in here:  I went out with my girls (that includes every group....at least once) since the last time I blogged.  Clubbed, chilled and dined out way too much within the past month.    Went to my friend's BF's house warming party....someone got something outta it (a new friend....i hope >_  Went to the bowling event....regretted it at first (weirdos)....but then I ended up having a blast (thanx Judy for getting us out that night).  I met a lot of new friends there...which brought us together for the next few outtings:...all of these by the way are my "first".....hahaha.... the bon fire @ Scar Bluffs at night.....the corn maze @ Wasaga (a lot of fun....definitely gonna do this again)....went to the Taste of Danforth too....sooooo yummy.    I also visited Montreal again with Bonnie, Angela, Chris.  We had fun....but the last time i think we partied it up more than this time.  We definitely bonded on this trip, we got to know each other on a much deeper level....wouldn't you say so, girls?....hahaha  Bren came back from Quebec.......had a family BBQ (the one and only this summer).....she's busy getting ready to move outta here again....lots to do still!!  Plans for the rest of the summer: -BBQs (maybe at least another 3-4 to attend) -Wasaga Beach -Andrea's party -Sylvia's party -Amanda's party -trip to Phili (sending Bren off) -chill.....club....drink....sing....relax!!  Also, there is a new member in my family.....his name is NEMO!!  Somewhere in that list, I will have to fit in moving myself back into Barrie.....anyone willing to help me? >_

Work was very relaxing once again, I worked at EG with Elsa and Trevor.....lotsa laughs~  Elsa invited me to dinner with her friends, but since today would be Bren's last dinner at home, I decided to go home for dinner.....i'll join her later on tonight for some fun.  Happy be-lated b-day to Sylvia, hope you have lotsa fun at the beach bbq today! (sorry I bummed out)  I am watching my sister scurry around the house for some last minute packing....she's bringing a lot of stuff......and she's gonna buy more once she gets there too!!!

      Today was filled with laughs.  Work was relaxing....got off early again, headed straight down to BB to meet the others before we went to the restaurant.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY AMANDA!! She is the most happy b-day girl I know....she was excited about today during the whole week.  We managed to fit all 6 of us into my car and off we went to Bambu Restaurant at the Queens Quay.    We had to wait for Amanda's other's friends, so we ordered appetizers to share amoungst all of us.....yummy stuff, except for the shrimp chips with peanut sauce, that's just plain gross....shrip chips are meant to be eaten plain....no?  We talked a lot amoungst our little work group...talked about first impressions.....funny encounters....first interviews by the big bosses.....the list goes on.  I also learned more about some of my co-workers....some are quite predictable while others were not.     After dinner (and a couple of drinks)....Ann and I went to the International market at the Queens Quay before we went back to get my car.  We headed to INSIDE and partied the rest of the night.....the crowd there tonight were quite young.....but again.....my night was filled with many laughs.   Just a thought.... How much of a little nudge would you need before you react or act??

      It was very busy at work today....people came in packs, the store was sooo noisy!!  I was looking forward to the end of the day, since I went to the concert today.  The concert was amazing....they could REALLY sing and were extremely entertaining too!!  For the people who are watching it tommorrow, I hope you will all like it as much as I did.  One warning though, the older ladies WILL sing and dance....lol.    I watched S.W.A.T last night.....JV you were right, not as good as I expected it to be....but Colin Farro was a cutie!    I realize that not all things happen for a reason....you might have to take the initiative to MAKE something happen.....I don't think I am ready to do that yet.

      Went to sushi buffet today with the girls....we over-estimated ourselves yet again.....but we refused to admit to the lady (who was quite rude to us) that we really couldn't eat all that stuff on our table.  She didn't hassle us at the end, but we were scared that she was gonna charge us regular price...hahaha.    We walked off our meal at First Markham (actually, we wasted time there) since we had to catch a movie there later on.  We watched "The American Wedding"....it was hilarious....definitely dirty humor and stupidity......"chocolate truffles anyone?"...hahaha*gross*.    I was actually waiting for a call all day, but never recieved it.....i wonder when it will come.  A lot on my mind.....gotta figure it all out.

      I finally got my internet back!!  Yesterday's picnic at the Bluffs was quite a success (besides the lack of food :o(....sorry guys!!)  I had fun.....the day started with the hectic parking situation at the park.....finding everyone (some people were on the wrong side of the park)......calling other people who weren't here yet to make sure they find their way to us.....setting up our SPOT (shade/sun).....figuring out something to do before the others get here: attempts of kite-flying......beach v-ball.....playing in the water.....taking pictures.  I must say that the small amount of food that was available to feed the 24 of us was yummy....hehehe.....Francis, Yan, Angela and Chris went out to get pizza to fill the others who were still hungry (sorry again about that guys >_ _ _

      Let's continue from where I left off at my last blog....  So, I did end up joining Elsa and her friends later on Saturday evening.  I surprised her with my "skills"...hahaha.  Too bad I had to leave early since I had to wake up early the next morning.  I will definitely join you guys again....next week you said?...hahaha  I came back from my 3 day trip to Philidephia....I was sooo tired yesterday....8 hour drive back was quite exhausting, plus after 3 days of unpacking, shopping and making Bren's home "a home".    We got up bright and early Sunday morning and drove to Phili, got to Pennsylvania about 3:30pm....unloaded her stuff into her apartment (very nice apartment...with a front desk....and hotel lobby).  We headed straight out to buy more stuff, didn't actually get back to her apartment until 9:30 that night, made dinner, cleaned a bit and headed out to the hotel (down the street....way, down the street).    The next morning we got up bright and early again, enjoyed the continental breakfast, then headed out to find Bren a bed and desk.  We were quite successful.  Went back to put together the stuff (by this time, I could see a room forming).  Bren actually had to attend an orientation thingy that night, so she left  us at the apartment and head across the street to her school with her roommate.  She came back with some new people she met who also live in her building (by this time, we had the bed up and half her desk together....hahaha).  Monday night we slept at Bren's place.  My dad took her bed and my mom and us girls slept on air mattresses on her carpeted floor.    Bren woke up bright and early the next morning to attend a mandatory orientation again, while we slept in a little more.  My dad and I then headed out to find Bren a TV, a stool, and some hardware for her sink....came back for lunch....said our goodbyes and headed off to the mall.  Since I was up really early for the past couple of days and with all the driving we were doing around Pennsylvania, I was sooo exhausted I didn't even feel like shopping (can you believe it??)  I just wanted to come home...to my own bed....to my stuff animals....to my computer....hahaha (i am spoiled....my dad agrees). I came outta the mall empty handed of course and off we headed back to Toronto.  By the time we finally pulled up to my driveway, it was about 11:45pm....I refused to help with the luggage in the car....i just came right inside, dropped MY own stuff off in my room and headed for the shower.  I really needed a shower to get myself out of the "zombie state"....do you know what I mean?  After that I was wide awake.    So that was basically my weekend....I need to find things to do this week....and of course the long weekend.  I don't have any plans yet, does anyone have any ideas?

      Back at school for two day already.....I am gradually getting back into the swing of things.  But waking up @ 6:00am in the morning for my 8:00am classes is definitely not kicking in yet.  I basically have two theory classes and three practicals this semester....that gives me more time to focus on the theoretical classes.    Clair got the papers signed yesterday and the house is done.  I just have to wait for her to move into the house this weekend.  I really don't want to be the first one moving in....my dad agrees, he insists that my roommates should be in there first before I move in.  I 'll let you guys know if I need help, okay? (don't you all get up at once now...hehe)    There is something wrong with my computer!!  It is sick!!  I can't get onto ICQ and even using the internet....I get booted off too often *urgh*  It is quite frustrating!  I think my computer has to see a doctor.  It was fine this afternoon.....  So guys.....I guess I won't be on ICQ until my computer is better....you can call me, email me or keep me updated using your blogs >_  Just wanted to add one last thing:  thanx for asking me out....I enjoyed the conversations we had....I promise that I will let you know if I am tired next time >_

      update.....  1) schedule settled 2) won't move into Barrie until next week (I will be living at home this week!!) 3) new nick name "bonus hog"....hehehe  Day off  Friday was sooo unproductive.  I woke up later than I had planned to, rushed and got ready to leave for Barrie.  Traffic wasn't too bad, got to school around 11:15, picked up my schedule and chatted with my teachers and friends that I haven't seen all summer >_  I was told by one of my teachers that this year's enrolment has increased and over half are asians (chinese, korean, viet...etc....OMG!!).  It's gonna be LOUD....lol, asians are all LOUD!!  I drove back to Markham, had lunch with my parents and sister, ran some errands then went to get Bonnie.  We went shopping, I bought a couple of things, met up with Angela.....had bbtea, went shopping again, then met up with Doris for dinner.  After dinner, we joined Mitch, Danbee, Alex and Mitch's friends for K @ Take One.  I haven't seen him all summer.....I know there is no excuse......I am glad we finally met up though >_

      Happy Autumn Festival!!  The moon is amazingly round, bright and pretty.  I was out last night and when I was heading home, I was driving right into the big, round moon ("the big egg yolk" as my mom would say).....it should even be prettier tomorrow!  I can't believe the second week of school is almost over...three more hours of class tomorrow morning and that's it!  It has gone by too quickly.    Raymond came up to Barrie with us today.  Obviously he didn't sit in class, instead he found a driving range and enjoyed himself there for an hour.  He even managed to go to the mall to do a little shopping!!....lol....I went by the house again today, still missing everything from the list from Sunday....stove and fridge should be in sunday (or so they say).  Susanna's mattress is in.....gotta get internet installed.....I really need to settle down up there....c'mon people get moving! >_

      Moved my bed and desk into Barrie today.  I was locked out (my key didn't work!).  I called Clair, she was on her way up too, so I waited around for her.  When she finally got to the house, her car was packed with things.  We helped her unload, then unloaded my things into my room.  Overall, the house is quite nice....it's just not finished!  We don't have a stove or a fridge, nor screens or wheelers for the windows....the house still needs more time.  After a talk with my parents, I may not move into the house until next month!....  I talked to a friend today about sooo many things, some I really hope won't be shared again....lol.  We shared stories from the past and present....about us and others too....hehehe....thanx for the help again!

      First week of school was quite simple and tiring....simple, because most classes were shortened or pointless (ex. going through the outline)....tiring, because I have two 8am classes and living at home means that I have to wake up @ 6am in order to be ready and out of the house by 6:45 (thanx for the rides susanna).  I yawned sooo much at school....yeah, I know I should sleep earlier, but I am still not use to sleeping before 12:00 or 1:00 yet.    Thursday after school I had lunch with my parents, ran some errands with my mom then headed home to watch TV/videos (something I haven't done in awhile).  My sister came home and fell asleep beside me......lol, such a sleepy head!!  I went to play badminton with Eric later on that night....yeah, I am sooo outta shape (I haven't played since gr. 9?...i think).  We met up with Bonnie, Sylvia and Betty for a late meal that night.....I had a yummy green tea tempura ice cream!!  I had work Friday @ BCE.  Judy stopped by to chat before her Go train....poor girl was up really early!!  I headed home on the Go also after work, had dinner at home and watched some more TV (continuation from yesterday).  I talked on the phone for awhile with a freind of mine, when she noticed that I sounded different...like I was sick.  After I hung up with her and thought about what she described....yeah, I think I am feeling a little sick....I had the sniffles, my throat was a little itchy.  I quickly showered, took a tylenol and headed straight to bed (@ 11:30pm!!....OMG).    I felt a lot better this morning.  I guess I really needed the sleep I deprived myself of during the week.  I went to work @ BB today....a very slow day compared to last weekend....celebrated David's b-day too.  I went out with Judy and JV for some chinese dessert after dinner.  I had "ginger hamaro with egg whites"....I think....lol (weird translations on the menu).  Then we found out that Jess and a group of friends were having hot pot next door to our dessert place.....too weird/coincidental.  They came over after their hot pot and had some desserts too.    I am getting sleepy now.....tomorrow I will get to sleep in a bit.  Gonna move my bed and desk into Barrie tomorrow.....dunno what else I will bring yet.  I won't be staying overnight there tomorrow since I don't know how livable (is that a word?) the house is yet.  I will fill you guys in when I get back tomorrow >_

      Went to dinner with Mitch and Bonnie tonight....ordered way too much food again...but the human garbage ate the leftover pieces...lol.  Mitch: I hope you're actually gonna have a b-day celebration....i really don't want this to be the only thing/celebration for your b-day.    Plans for roller-blading today was cancelled.  Jo told Bonnie and I that it wouldn't be wise for us "beginners" to blade on our own....we can break ALL of our bones...lol!!  I am definitely looking forward to Sunday....dunno what time and dunno where yet, but we (Bonnie and I) really wanted to break into our blades this weekend!!  Any suggestions??  Here's something to think about.....  1)  Would you tell someone who you "think" likes you that you don't like them? or would you just go with the flow and let that person figure it out on their own???  2)  For the guys:  If you like a girl, would you tell her? or would you wait for further signs? when you think of her will you call her, just to hear her voice?

      I really thought i was gonna live in Barrie this week.....but yet again i didn't!!....what is wrong with me?  Everyone is asking me if I am scared?...no, i'm not....i just like it here in Toronto....I like sleeping in my own bed, chatting on my own phone, watching TV in my compfy spot, I like it when people call me up on my cell (which in Barrie would be LD)....I know I am being a baby about this...i need to grow up!!  My parent's totally don't want me living in Barrie now...."There's no snow on the ground, you can still live at home...don't live in Barrie yet".....lol.  I have gradually moved more things into the house throughout this week.  The fridge and stove are in now, the window openers are installed, my computer is set up (just waiting for my modem)....i really have no excuse for not staying up there next week (my roommates are bugging me about actually staying there overnight!!).   Although I will be using the Labatt Line (free LD calls!!) I don't think I can live up there without my internet....so I hope my modem is delivered before next Monday.  Since I haven't been living up there, I also have not sat down and studied nor have I gone to the gym yet....i must be deligent and go frequently!!   I went to buy my wrist guards today....i got the gel pad ones, not the kind that wraps around your lower arm...i'll show you guys when i see ya.  I am looking forward to my first run on these blades....it may take me awhile to balance (just like skating for the first time in the winter).    I hope the hurricane will sweep through Ontario gently, i still want to have fun this weekend.  How about roller-blading Sunday???  Lemme know if you're interested okay? >_

      Continuing from my last blog....  Thursday I went to play badminton again....I actually played a game this time, although i really didn't know the rules etc....but it went well......lol.  My sister went to pick up my roller-blades for me....i have yet to try them on.....but i am excited to go out and roller-blade!!  Work on Friday was steady....i was asked to see the head managers (OMG i was scared!!)...it was nothing though....we just chatted, it went well.  I went to get my new phone after work....it has polyphonic sounds now....yeah, i know....not really that cool!!  I was really tired by the time i got home....but i decided to go out to chat with the girls.  To make a long story short....I made a stupid mistake and i don't think I will ever hear the end of it!  Saturday I had a lot of fun at work.....basically laughing my head off!  Worked with Kevin at BB (we always have fun making him laugh....or feel awkward).  I decided not to go out for drinks with them and headed home.  I came home....played with my phone, inputted numbers and read a bit of the manual and headed to bed at 12 to catch up on my lost sleep during the week.   Today, I went to Yorkdale....I bought 1 out of the 3 cards I was looking for.....I also bought a little something for someone....(can't put the name on here).  It's gonna be funny when this person see this item.....lol.  I came home to help my sister with her farewell BBQ party for one of her co-workers.  I had fun.....laughed a lot......they are just too silly together.    Also, I just found out today that JV's b-day is on Tuesday!  Happy Early B-day!!....and again, no one can ever out do Judy....you are a lucky guy!!  Looking forward to....  1) actually living in the new house in Barrie (haven't yet) 2) roller-blading on my new blades (I need to buy my wrist guards!!) 3) Inside on Friday?? 4) Angela's b-day party

      Yummy~~  I just had sushi for dinner.  We decided to order take out after our fitness classes this afternoon for dinner. We did a yoga class followed by an ABT class.  The yoga class was sooo boring!! the instructor was such a hippy...lol.   So the ABT class was really tiring after the yoga.  We came home, had a snack and watched Jerry Maguire and then took naps...i haven't taken on in awhile so it kinda felt funny...hehe.  We are getting ready to watch "The Bachelor" @ 9:00pm.  Bob was such a cutie last time, this series will be fun to watch.  I'll update later. >_  I am back from watching the first episode of "The Bachelor"!  It was soo good.  The girls were so relaxed and out-going in this series.  I think it's because Bob is just a regular Joe, not a cocky, multi-millionaire.  I will definitely watch this season faithfully.  The previews were also very good...really looking forward to it...lol.  Mitch called me today, I hope he sticks to his decision...dunno if I will meet up with him this weekend though...

      I finally went to the new gym at school today...OMG, I am sooo outta shape.  On certain machines I can't lift the weights I used to be able to lift last year!!  Tina, Clair and I bumped into Shaun and Ken there too...it was weird how Tina was teaching the boys how to use the medicine balls...lol.  She's my personal trainer!! (soon to be....we haven't started yet...hahaha)  Clair and I have both decided to take it slow this week to get back into the pace of things.  We will be attending two of the fitness classes tomorrow though...we have to motivate each other...lol.  I also tried out my new runner today...i bought it yesterday at the mall...it's turqoise, grey and white~   After the gym we headed home and cooked dinner...we ended up sharing our foods...I must say I am definitely the worst cook amongst the three of us.  These girls can make things from scratch!!  I will definitely have to do some grocery shopping this weekend when I go home...gotta fill up those cupboards!! >_

      Words to remember:   "Girls are like apples on trees. The best ones are at the top of the tree. The boys don't want to reach for the good ones because they're afraid of falling and getting hurt. Instead they just get the rotten apples that are on the ground, that aren't as good, but easy. So the apples at the top think that there is something wrong with them, when in reality, they are amazing. That is why we just have to be a little patient and the right boy, the one who takes a chance to find the good, right apple, will come someday..."  I found that passage sometime ago and decided to share it with you all.  I do believe those are words of wisdom...lol.   So, I am finally in Barrie...yup, spending the week here.  I will be back in TO on thursday afternoon >_  I just realized that this is the first time that my sisters and I are all separated.  When Jo was in Western, Bren and I was at home...when I was in Barrie, Bren and Jo was at home...when Bren was in Quebec (and now Penn) Jo and I was at home...kinda weird...anyways update later >_

      I am back!...and quite alive...lol.  After lunch @ Kenny Noodles we headed down by the Lakeshore to blade.  Today was a lot of fun, the trail was very nice (except for the bumpy part and the red sections).  I also liked the lakeview which was complimented by the gorgeous sun...just perfect >_  Needless to say I did fall...not on the downhill parts but on flat ground...lol.  Don't ask, I have no idea why I fell both times, it was more of a balance issue for me, i think.  A pat on the back for Bonnie...she didn't fall once and did amazingly well today.  I bet you we will very well tonight...hehehe.   >_  Special thanx to Eric for taking Bonnie and I on our first ride on our new blades >_  I have decided to live in Barrie tomorrow night.  My grandma has already made me noodles to bring in...yummy!!  I hope the modem will work with my computer so I will have internet access by tomorrow night, or else I will be quite bored up there.  But I think I will actually start studying too...that's basically what I did last year:  study in boring Barrie during the week and then come home to have fun (I don't really remember doing homework at home...).  Hopefully the course load won't get more difficult so I would be able to continue the pattern this year.    Remember, I will have voice mail until the beginning of December on my cell...so you guys can call me and leave me a msg...then I can call you back on my barrie line so we can avoid LD charges!! >_

      Yesterday's party was a great success!!....I had a lot of fun.  Too bad Angela was sick, so she couldn't get wasted....lol.  Seriously Angela, you have such considerate friends ordering you Honey Lemon instead of shots/beer/cocktails!!  I hope you'll use your present soon!! (she actually had two of her presents ON during the party!!...lol)    Work was slow in the morning but it definitely picked up later on in the day, since I wasn't wearing my comfy shoes, I really felt the aftermath :o(  However, I did end up doing two amazing sales before closing...to customers in the states...who asked me to visit them when I go shopping at the outlet mall in Niagara...hehe...such nice people!!  Gonna go blading today...I'll fill you guys when I get back...hehe...pray that I come back intact! >_

When I woke up this morning...there was SNOW falling from the sky...I'm serious!! I saw it with my own eyes!! and when we went out to start the car, Tina's windows were blanketed with a thin layer of snow...I really have to bring up winter gear or I'll definitely freeze up there dressed as I have this week!  It is pretty scary how it's only the second of October, the clocks haven't even been turned back yet and it gets dark by 6:30 and snow is falling...what are we gonna do this weather?  Since it's October...I will be working at the York Mills and Bayview location on saturdays...dunno how that's gonna work out...but come by and visit okay?...hehe >_

      I am feeling much better today...tylenol cold (night) worked well for me.  I only had minor sniffles today and was up by 9:00am this morning.  I got some HW done, then headed to school with Tina to the Library (I am such a good girl!!).  Class went by quickly, I finished all my september projects today and even started my first october one.    After my first class it just hit me that I haven't eaten since yesterday @ 4:00pm.  Wow! and I wasn't even hungry...I kinda said that out load and everyone around me was like "What's wrong with you?"....i dunno, i guess it was cuz I was feeling sick and just didn't feel like eating.  We all headed up to the cafe and the watched me order my Vege sandwich from Tim Hortons...lol.  It was delicious! (thanx girls)    Optics was cut short today...we made plans for tomorrow evening and off we went our separate ways.  Tina, Clair and I went to the gym (yes...we are keeping to our routines...haven't been lazy yet!!).  I did some cardio on the ecliptic machine, then did my routine of weight machines.  We came home and cooked...I made "Broccolli Sausage Rigatoni with Cream of Mushroom Sauce"....nice eh?...lol.  I made way too much (i still can't figure out portions) so i fed some to Clair and saved the rest for lunch tomorrow.  Gotta do some reading now...blog later.

      I had fun this weekend:   Went to Inside on Friday.  Angela, Bonnie, Jo and I met up with Mitch and his friend, Alex, there.  Flora, Kev, Wen, Mon, Louis and his friend showed up too.  A lot of people showed up for Yan's birthday...the birthday boy was a little drunk.  We left Angela inside the VIP louge and we danced outside.  Good music + Right crowd = a fun time >_  Judy and Juivette came over to chill on Saturday night.  We talked and talked...mostly about nothing...lol.  I have to admit that Juivette is definitely one of the girls...hehehe.  Today Eric came up to Barrie with me to set up the network between my roommate's computer and mine.  He's soo professional, making the wires, tucking wires...thanks a lot!!  Now we'll just have to plugg her laptop in, configure it and see if it works...sounds easy eh?...lol...let's see how long it'll take us to do that >_

      I was very tired today.  For the past two days I have been studying for my Patho Ocular test, since I really didn't study much over the weekend.  Last night Susanna stayed over and instead of studying we did a lot of talking.  We stayed up until 3:30am talking...it really didn't seem that late though.  She brought up many points in our conversation which I didn't really realize myself.  I may  not actually be as keen as I thought I was.  I thought I was quite a sensitive and aware person...but I guess I am not according to her.  She really got me thinking.  She was quite frustrated with me...she now understands why I don't have a BF (since, in her words "I let a lot of them slip away")...lol.  I am kinda glad she brought up all these things, but I am in a very confused state right now.  I couldn't concentrate all day.  We had a 3 hr break before our test, which I could have concentrated and got some serious studying done, but instead I would wandered off in my thoughts.  I really dunno what to do....  I came home today.  I didn't want to stay in Barrie since both my roommates will be out late tonight.  I have a class tomorrow morning then I'll be done for the week.  I just realized it's long weekend...I think I need to have some fun to take my mind off things! >_

      I decided to wake up early this morning to do some studying since I didn't really studying over the weekend...but as you guys can see I decided to take some time to blog about my weekend first...hehe.  Friday after work, I decided to accompany Ann to dinner.  We did a little shopping first on Bloor and Yonge then we jumped on the subway and headed uptown for dinner.  We chatted all night (very confidential stuff...lol) over a couple of drinks.  I learned soo much more about her...found many similarities and difference b/t each other too.  By the time I got home it was late...no time for studying...headed to bed after my long day.  Saturday was my first day working @ York Mills and Bayview.  It was such a slow day since this store is located in a mainly Jewish community and it was the weekend of their New Years.  I did bring along my notes and probably read a chapter or two from my text.  After dinner, I attempted to study again...got through some more stuff, before I started chatting with Jo...then Bren on the phone...then Bonnie...lol.  I know, I really need to focus and concentrate on what I am suppose to do!!  I woke up earlier Sunday morning to study...this time I really did study.  By late afternoon all my studying was put to a end...we headed up to Barrie, stopped by my place, then went to Rama.  The Gigi concert was actually good.  I don't really like her and I really did not intend on going to the concert, but since I had free tickets...why not go right?  I won't put details on here, but if you wanna know more about it ask me.  After two long talks over the weekend, it brings me back to think: "Why not me?"..."How much longer?"

      I got home really early today, by 12.  I went to lunch with my parents, went shopping, went out for dinner and then came home.  The surprise is finally completed as of 10:00pm today.  It would be priceless to see her reaction.    I will have turkey fried rice for lunch tomorrow compliments of Ann...soo sweet of her...hehe.  Just in case some of you haven't noticed I have been going on MSN a lot now-a-days.  I am slowly learning more and more about it's special functions...etc...although i must say I am still a newbie.  I had my first 3-way yesterday...it was soo much fun...i know I'm such a loser.  I caught up with Bill (in Hamilton) and Mon...they made me laugh soo much.  I really hope you guys can make it for the party.  So sooner or later...all these MSN users will convert me totally...but dun worry, as of today, I am still an ICQ user >_  The numbers for the party are gradually increasing...people, you have to reply to the evite...don't just read it and keep it in your inbox (RICKY!...lol).  I am looking forward to it.  Oh...    *congrats* Rujilda...you should have told me earlier!!   I am all for surprises >_

      Whenever I go out with my co-workers, I end up having a blast.  They are hilarious!!  We went to a restaurant called Zelda's for Ann's birthday.  It's on Church street right in the center of the Gay District...lol.  They were suppose to have a caberet show tonight, but it was cancelled!!  But we still had a blast, mango daquiris, bitch slaps (it's a name for a martini), Ann's first "blow job"...it was all too funny.    Happy Birthday Annie-B!!...getting older and wiser >_

      Thanksgiving Weekend consisted of Friday @ Inside, Saturday baby shower, Sunday @ home and Monday turkey feast.    Woke up this morning to pack for Barrie (the 2 nights)...lol.  Headed up around 11:45...got to Newmarket when it hit us that class starts @ 12:00 today...lol.  We decided to not go up since this teacher will be anal with us if we showed up late...so we turned around and came home.  Yup...we decided to tell him we had a flat on our way up so we'll stay on his good side...lol.  Since I am @ home, I decided to join in on Ann's b-day celebrations later on tonight...i'll blog about that later >_  But I have to wish two b-day girls a very happy b-day first:  HAPPY BIRTHDAY TRISH!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY ANN!!

      although I didn't stay in Barrie this week...i didn't miss my Bachelor show!!  I am soo glad that LeAnne is gone ~yeah, yeah~  It's gonna be interesting to see who he picks in the end.  I think the four girls remaining all have a fair chance...although I kinda think Mary will be kicked off next.    So besides the Birthday party...I am also looking forward to the Haunted Adventure.  We are planning to go on Halloween this year.  So far we don't have enough numbers to pre-book tickets...but hopefully we'll find enough people to go.  It's a fun adventure to go on with your friends to share your screams and laughters.  Bonnie, thanks for being such a great friend.

      I was home all day today.  Slept in until 1:00pm...yup, yup...felt really good!!  Had lunch then watched TV all afternoon (I had to catch up with all those tapes...hehe).  Was suppose to catch up with Bonnie today/tonight, but there was a change of plans.  Today was the most relaxing day (but not boring) in awhile.  * The littliest things make me smile * >_

      I have been out for dinner every night since thurs...my big belly is protruding!!    I went shopping with Ann after work on Friday.  I was picked up to go to dinner (which was extremely boring and long...i didn't even want to go).  I wanted to do other things and be with people I enjoy to have as company...not boring relatives who plan last minute dinners and expect you to show up!! (sorri...had to let out my frustrations).  My night ended with two kids refusing to leave my house @ 12:00am...omg...I was sooo tired by then.  I quickly showered, changed into my PJs watched some TV and relaxed.  I found out that I won't have to work @ YM every saturdays...I will be moving around.  It was actually pretty busy there today...there was one point where the store was packed and with only two people working...it wasn't pleasant.    I spent tonight with my "asian" co-workers and Elsa's two friends.  We shopped a bit and then headed to dinner, followed by bbt.  Yup, I think we did it all...lol...again, I laughed so much tonight.  We will definitely organize more of these outtings...it'll be our bonding time...lol.  After bbt, we met up with Ann's friends @ Monopoly to celebrate her extended birthday...which was on Tuesday...but technically her celebrations started last Friday until tonight...omg!!    I want to do the same...lol.  I want to be surprised, I want to have a week of celebrations too!! >_  This will be my first b-day without my sister...i know it'll be different, but i can't imagine if it'll be a weird different, a happy different, a sad different....i can't tell yet.  I am really looking forward to it though!  >_

      So here's how my 23rd birthday flew by today...  Kept Bren up until about 2:00am talking to me...lol.  She loved the gifts, esp the kid's cards...hehe.  She finally watched the CD...so sweet of the gals to make that one for her.    I was woken up by a phone call from Amanda this morning (8:00am)...she called to leave a msg on my cell phone before she headed to work, but instead, I picked up...lol.  Thanx >_  Headed to school, normal day...tried to keep my birthday to myself...only a few of my close friends knew.  Until...my second class, when a "big mouth" wished me happy birthday and the WHOLE class started to sing happy birthday to me...OMG, it was soo embarassing!!  I felt as though I was in elementary school again.  They all had a blast watching me blush!!...even the teacher was enjoying it!!  Came back to Markham by 7:00pm and headed to dinner @ a Japanese Restaurant...sooo, full!!  Bumped into people I knew there...hehe.    Came home, had a delicious cake...Mango Meringue...Simon and Anna stopped by...thanx for the present and your time Simon!!...hehe. Then I went to bbt with Bonnie...thanx for the talk and the present!! >_  Thanks guys for all the presents, your presences and all the smiles you gave me today.  I am definitely looking forward to the party...more names were added to the list today...lol.

      I went shopping again this weekend.  I didn't buy anything, it was more of a chilling/bonding time for us...hehe.  Watched Intolerable Cruelty...it was alright, some funny parts, a lot of dumb humour, which makes the movie relaxing...hehe.  Catherine Zeta Jones looks amazing for her age and even after having children.  She's not a size 2, but she has the "natural and healthy" look.  I went to Pacific today with my sister.  I bought a frame...yup, it's funky!...lol.  I know you guys can't wait to see it...i won't actually get it until later...lenses will be put in at another place.    I helped my dad cook dinner today.  Yeah, it was very weird, but I actually enjoyed spending time with him >_  I will be staying the Toronto the whole week next week too...gimme a call guys!...not sure what's going on yet, but I'm up for anything...hehe.  I am not gonna think too much...  maybe there isn't anything to be confused about anyway...>_

      Back in Barrie now :o(  I would like to thank a certain someone for a final birthday surprise.  I really didn't expect it >_  I watched Scary Movie 3 yesterday.  It's funny guys go watch it...it's even better if you've watched "the ring" cuz most of the movie mimicks it...hehe.    I should probably take the time I have in Barrie to study...but I'm not in studying gear...dunno what to do.  Christmas Party...should I go or not?

      I had a BLAST yesterday!!  I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who showed up at the party...I must say it was a great turn out...lol...(omg the room was PACKED!)   There was definitely over 40 people in the room at one point.    There's so much to say and I dunno where to start.  My night started with dinner with the girls...the we went to Take One...then everyone started to come...it was great seeing all you guys again.  It was definitely a memorable night.    Halloween night, I went to the Magic Hills Haunted Adventure.  Lotsa fun too!...we were chased down by the actors/actresses there...lol.  But definitely too long of a wait.  My back and legs were in pain by the end of the night, because I played badminton the night before, worked all day friday and then went to the haunted thingy...but it was all worth it >_  Have a Wedding Reception to go to tonight...hehe.

      My sister msged today to tell me that Noble was attacked by the little vicious dog next door!!  His ear was bleeding!! :(  I also came to a conclusion with my friend that Barrie may be a happening place...we know of a couple of people hooking up here...hehe.  It is cute to hear that my friend (a guy) is feeling warm and fuzzy about this girl he's interested in.  He wants to spend time with her, call her and would walk over to her place (in the freezing cold) late at night just to see her and talk to her...that is just too sweet.  This guy is by no means a "sweet" guy by outlook...he's big and though!...lol.  He even planned all his studying last week for the test this week, so he would have extra time to go to the movies with this girl tonight.   Mind you, this guy doesn't normally even study, but I think he's changing his ways now...i dunno if it is because of her.  I am happy for him though.    Maybe Barrie isn't all that bad afterall, at least some people are getting something out of their time here >_

      Let's see what has happened since my last blog...  I went to highlight my hair on Thursday with Angela...I now have purple highlights on a black base...very bold, I believe the boldest I have ever gone.  I must admit I was scared of the results in the beginning, but the more I look at it, the more I like it >_  After work Friday, I bailed outta three different outtings...movies and dinner with my co-workers, the Afterlife party and K with Angela @ tunnel...I was too tired from work that I didn't want to go out :o(  Saturday, I decided to stay at home for dinner (being a good girl...lol).  I didn't have the car, so I was stranded at home :o(  I watched the eclipse though...it wasn't as spectacular as I expected it to be.  I was invited to K, but then it was cancelled last minute...so again, I stayed at home...this is really a record for me...my mom liked it though...lol.  Today is Jojo's b-day...HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO U, happy birthday to u, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO JOJO, happy birthday to u!!....yeah, she's the youngest, so she gets her way...especially on her b-day!  We went out for dinner and then came home for the cake...my mango one was better than yours...lol.  I also watched THE MATRIX today, I actually liked this one...I thought the first one was good, then the second one wasn't that great...so I didn't know what to expect with the third one.    Heading back into Barrie tomorrow :o(  P.S.  I hope you get better soon... >_

      It's tuesday...cheap movie night...stranded in Barrie.  I may come home tomorrow though...i need to find a ride!  I still wanna watch "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"...there are a lot of movies coming out that I wanna watch too.    I found out today that I should be done school by the first week of December.  Hopefully the lab exam can be moved up to that same week too, so everything will be over with that week.    I will be working full-time during the month of December...but I definitely need to have some fun too.  I dunno how I will balance it, but I will try my best.    Some things I wanna do: ~Skating @ Nathan Philips Square ~Skiing ~go see Christmas lights (i dunno where) ~PARTY!!

      I have been thinking over the weekend about a lot of stuff.  I dunno if i should let go or try and find out the answer.  I am kinda scared to find out the answer just in case it's not what I want to hear.  Like some of my friends say...I just think too much...but I just can't help it.  I stole these quotes from Angela's site:    " It hurts to love someone and not be loved in return, but what is the most painful is to love someone and never finding the courage to let the person know how you feel."  "Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person, we should know how to be grateful for that gift."  "A sad thing about life is that when you meet someone who means a lot to you only to find out in the end that it was never bound to be and you just have to let go."  "Love comes to those who still hope even though they've been disappointed, to those who still believe even though they've been betrayed, need to love those who still love even though they've been hurt before."  These quotes are all very true...but i just don't know where I stand.... >_

      Wow...I haven't blogged in quite awhile...what have you guys have been missing out on~~lol...let's see:  yes, I have been busy for the past couple of days...with what?...can't tell ya...hahaha (j/j)  I was studying for a test and then doing an assignment for school, but besides that...  I was bothered by something.  I have finally given up on it since nothing seems to progress.  When it eventually progresses one small step, something happens and two steps gets taken backwards...confused yet?...yeah~ so that's how I have been feeling for the past couple of weeks.    Thanks to all those who have leant me their ears and time.  I am okay.  I'm sure the right one will come along...one who won't keep me guessing...hehe >_  Girl talks are always a good thing...esp over bbt...and giggling and being silly added to it all...helps relieve all my bothers.   Bren is back!!  She got back Monday.  We have been eating non-stop since she has come back (she's deprived of yummy food over there...i can feel the pounds adding on!!).  Besides seeing family and meeting up with friends, we (the sisters) have found a lot of time to chat...something we have missed out on.  It's funny how Jo and I forget that Bren doesn't know what we're talking about sometimes, since she wasn't with us when certain things happened.  Gonna party it up tomorrow...haven't gone out to party in awhile.  Bren will be gone on Sunday, so I'll be able to get some studying done then.    My exams are next week...2nd, 3rd and 4th...after that...I'm DONE!!!  Gimme a call to come out and play >_

      Snow...snow...and more snow~~  I am sitting in my room looking out the window and the snow looks so white and fluffy, but that wasn't my description of it when I has walking through it earlier today.  The snow is piling up high and the dangerous part is when you step in it...you really don't know how deep it really is...it's hazardous i tell you @_@  I got my funky glasses back yesterday during forum.  I like my glasses but i hate the lenses in them...i told the guy i didn't want poly...i still don't like it now...i can see a rainbow at the bottom of the glasses!  I'm gonna try and adjust them so that I won't see the rainbow...won't be able to do it until thursday though~  The so called storm last night was kinda scary...i would hear chunks of snow hit my window in the middle of the night...NO, it wasn't a snowball!...it was blowing snow...glad i wasn't outdoors at that time.  There's still something wrong with the wiring in the house still, because they tripped at least 6 times last night...Clare better get it looked at soon...it's frustrating running downstairs to switch the switch, when we're trying to study~  One exam down, two more to go...I am worried about the one tomorrow, hopefully all goes well.

      Something fun to relieve stress...hehehe  1. Key in the first 3 digit of your phone number into the calculator (not the area code). 2. Multiply by 80. 3. Add 1. 4. Multiply by 250. 5. Plus last 4 digit of your phone number. 6. Plus last 4 digit of your phone number again. 7. Minus 250. 8. Divide by 2 at last.  and....what do you get?....cool eh?...i dunno why it turns out like that though...

      This past weekend has been shopping, shopping and more shopping~    I am actually kinda tired of it now.  There isn't much out there to buy, for presents I mean...there's plenty to buy for myself...hahaha.  I just realized that children's toys are sooo expensive nowadays.  I find cuter outfits for children at much better prices than toys...but obviously kids like toys better than clothing...so that's why i didn't end up buying much yet.    But here's something to think about...  To those who think that presents require no thought at all...you're totally wrong!  A gift with thought is much more appreciated than those without thought...I am saying this through experience.  You can't just pick something up for someone.  For example if it's clothing: it must fit and at least be a colour the person would wear...it's just that simple, you just need to spend a couple more minutes to think before you run to the cashier to pay for it.    My mom is the perfect example of someone who runs into a store and "picks-up" a couple of things and expects these things to be suitable for one of the presents on her list.  OMG~  My sister and I went nuts!!  We basically took everything she "picked-up" the other day and returned it ALL!  I think she should leave the presents in our hands and she can just pay the bills later...lol.  That's all for now folks~

      The past few days...  Thursday: Shopping in sauga and @ Sherway Gardens.  Visited Kimmy and Kaitlynn (by far the cutest lil' munchkin).  Dinner with the girls from work.  All-you-can-eat hot pot + 4 single girls + a belated birthday + many stories = a great time >_  Friday:  clubbing @ distrikt for Viv's birthday.  I don't think I have ever bumped into so many ppl I know within a night at a club (it's a good thing).  I didn't get to drink though, I was the DD :o(  Saturday:  skating @ Nathan Phillips Square and dinner @ Le Biftheque.  The christmas lights, the light show (w ppl on stands a couple feet above ground), skating!!  I had fun~  I definitely want to go back and skate again before the holiday ends.    Sunday:  child labour~....hehe >_

      ~Happy New Year~  Welcoming 2004 and leaving 2003 behind, but definitely not forgetting it.  I am sitting here thinking back to the last 6 months...lots of memories were made; some good and some bad, many new experiences...but I must say they were all great learning experiences and have become a part of my past.    I really need a new start to this year: in school, at work, in my life altogether.  I need to be more accepting and open, I need to be more hard-working, I need to plan out my time (vacation time...lol)...I wouldn't call those my resolutions, but I guess they are things I should work towards >_  A lot has happened since my last blog.  Too many things to mention, all I can say is that my time was well spent.    "Everything happens for a reason and you can't expect things to always occur in your favour."  >_

      I've been blogging less and less...  I use to love blogging about my days: sharing my happiness, my funny stories, expressing my anger...I just feel a lost in words nowadays.  I have lots to share, but i don't know how much a wanna share or how sparse in details i should get on blogger.    I find spontaneous phone calls are the best solution to all this.  Over the phone you can lend someone your ears and in return, have one to fill on the other end.  Again "Everything happens for a reason and you can't expect things to always occur in your favour" >_ Just take the good things outta what has already occured and learn from your experience.    You will never know what's on the other end of the rainbow until you give yourself a chance to venture to the other end to see for yourself.  >_

      One tends not to appreciate something, until one realizes it is no longer yours.    I have taken somethings for granted in the past, and now, I really regret not valuing the time I had with him.  You will always be a member of our family~

      I got this forward from a friend...and you know what? It's sooo true!...lol >_  A woman's dilemma...   1. The nice men are ugly.  2. The handsome men are not nice.  3. The handsome and nice men are gay.  4. The handsome, nice and heterosexual men are married.  5. The men who are not so handsome, but are nice men, have no money  6. The men who are not so handsome, but are nice men with money think we are only after their money.  7. The handsome men without money are after our money.  8. The handsome men, who are not so nice and somewhat heterosexual, don't think we are beautiful enough.  9. The men who think we are beautiful, that are heterosexual, somewhat nice and have money, are COWARDS.  10. The men who are somewhat handsome, somewhat nice and have some money and thank God are heterosexual, are shy and NEVER MAKE THE FIRSTMOVE!!!!  11. The men who never make the first move, automatically lose interest in us when we take the initiative.    NOW ....WHO THE HELL UNDERSTANDS MEN?? Men are like a fine wine. They all start out like grapes, and it's a woman's job to stomp on them and keep them in the dark until they mature into something you'd like to have dinner with~

      I found this quite funny~~  What makes 100%? What does it mean to give MORE that 100%?   Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more than 100%?   We have all been to those meetings where someone wants you to give over 100%. How about achieving 103%?   What makes up 100% in life?   From a strictly mathematical viewpoint it goes like this, if:   A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z   is represented as:   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26   then:   H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K = 8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98%   and,   K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E = 11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 = 96%   but,   A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E = 1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100%   and,   B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T = 2+21+12+12+19+8+9+20 = 103%   AND, look how far ass kissing will take you.   A-S-S-K-I-S-S-I-N-G = 1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7 = 127%   So, one can then conclude with mathematical certainty that while Hard Work and Knowledge will get you close, and Attitude will get you there, Bullshit and Ass Kissing will put you over the top. I rest my case.  >_

      I am still in vacation mode...I find myself always thinking about things that have happened on the trip, and laughing to myself...yeah, i know...i'm nuts~  I recall a little chat I had with my girls on the trip about what kinda guy we would date...one thing I came across was:  "He has to be able to make me smile"  A lot of people can make me smile, what I mean is "make me smile unknowingly".  That's something I will have to learn to distinguish.    Enough rambling today...stayed tuned for more~ >_

      Reading week has come and gone.  Didn't do any reading what-so-ever...but that's besides the point!...lol  I took a week off school after reading week and headed south to Santo Domingo.  Santo Domingo was amazing~  The sandy beach, the clear water, the blazing sun, all-inclusive what more can I ask for?  I little more time...the trip was sooo relaxing, no worries, no watch to keep track of time...I back and I miss it all.    I had a chance to get to know my friends better and discover new friendships amoungst the group I travelled with.  I do believe that spending 24/7 with the same people is like spending a couple of months with them.  Think about it, you may only see your closest friends once every two weeks...hence, so I can actaully say I have known these new friends for at least 4 months....make sense?    I'm sure I will get to see you all very soon.   I will share my pictures and stories when I see you all in person >_

      Happy April Fools~  Didn't think I would fall for anything this year, BUT i did.  I'll just fill you guys in on what I've done for the past 2 weeks.  Besides school (projects and tests) I've just been chilling.  I have been spending a lot of time with my family.  I have cousins visiting from HK and from US.  My sister came back from Phili for a couple of days and now she's back in the US.  I've celebrated b-days: Adam's, Sherwin's and my mom's.  It's amazing how small this world is (yes, that same phrase AGAIN~).  I had fun at all of the celebrations.    Since I only have about 2 weeks of classes left, my friends and I decided that we should spend these two weeks together wisely.  On Monday after class, we all headed home to quickly finish up our projects due the next day, so we can meet up later on in the evening.  A couple of us headed over to Dooley's (a pool hall) and played all night there.  What made the night even better was that we found out that our early afternoon class was CANCELED!!  Our projects we still due but at least we can stay out longer and touch up on our project details the next morning.  The guys played for drinks while the girls played for FUN~  We didn't leave until 1:30 from the pool hall.  Too bad we can't make "Monday night out" our ritual.  To add to the fun, after a seminar in Mississauga yesterday, where we were fed delicious o'heurves and alky, we headed back to Markham for some soul food and karaoke....yup, karaoke on a WEDNESDAY night...it's soooo CHEAP!!  The funny and FUN thing was that our room of 18 ppl only consisted of 8 chinese; the other 10 were indian, serbian, black...lol.  Although we only spent about 2-3 hrs there, everyone had a blast!!  Some ppl who said they wouldn't sing, ended up being mic hogs.  Matt and Kenny also taught the others to play drinking games.  Don't worry guys, I will definitely plan one of these nights again, as long as you guys are up for it!  Bad news is, after all the fun on Monday, I think I caught SOMEONE'S cold.  Tuesday I started to feel a scratchy throat and then yesterday's drinking, yelling and singing did it....I think I have LOST my voice!!    oh and....."HAPPY BIRTHDAY ADAM~"  end of story~  >_

      I was officially done my program last Tuesday!!...wooohoo >_  I will be working full time at the dispensary for the summer.  My comprehensive exams will be at the end of August and then my Board exams will be sometime in either October or November.  Hopefully, if all goes well, I will be licenced by the end of this year >_  It seems as though these two years have flown by (literally)...I am not complaining though, as I really didn't like Barrie all that much.  However, finishing up makes me feel as though I have to except more responsibilities now, but i don't think I am ready yet.  A part of me wants to still have fun, play, travel, experience life...while the other side of me wants to work, be more mature and more responsible?!?...what to do?  I will definitely WORK full time, I need the money and I need a better grasp of things in my field.  But somehow between work, I want to travel:  a cruise, Asia (2006!)...those are just my first two choices now.    The bad news is that although I am done school, I will still have to put time aside during the summer to study for my exams after the summer.  I hope I won't get too lazy and loose focus~ >_

      Wow...it's only been about two weeks since I've blogged and Blogger has re-formatted~ pretty cool~  The past couple of weeks I have been getting together with friends, catching up at dinners, going out for drinks, desserts etc.  There are still many people I have not met up with and I hope that within the 3.5 months of summer, I will be able to manage that (that's one thing on my "to do list..." hehe).    I have pretty much kept to my schedule of visiting the gym 2-3 times a week.  It's kinda weird that there's so many people from my high school that go to the same gym~    The weather has been really nice these couple of days, kinda early for this kind of humidity, but it's a great change from the cold, rainy weather.  I just hope people don't get sick during the weather changes.    Work has been good.  I have been working at the HT location.  We have a food fest ("snack fest") at work everyday: sushi, cookies, wasabi peas...the other day my co-workers even had tiger shrimps with cocktail sauce!?!  I'm just glad we have a larger back room and the customers can't see us pigging out~    One problem I have with working 5 days a week is "I can't figure out what to wear!".  My sister and I sit in front of our closets every night trying to put something together for the next day.  I give up, many times I'll pull something out for her and she'd do the same for me.  Other times, I just get up in the morning and since I am always scurrying to get out of the house...I don't have much time, so I would HAVE to make up my decision quick on what to wear that day (depends of weather and what my eye catches first).  Decisions, decisions...that has been my biggest DILEMMA these days...I know, I'm a loser...lol. To add to that...I can't find much at the mall that I absolutely "must have" :( ...sad eh?

      ~Happy (early) Birthday Elsa~  We went to Red Lobster for dinner tonight.  I always have fun when I'm out with my vacation buds (+ stephy of course).  I laughed so much :) I really miss spending time with this group...we definitely have to go out more and I am sure we will *wink*...lol.    Today was actually a very interesting day for me: all the little secrets I was trying to get out of everyone.  I am VERY happy with the news I have heard today.  I am VERY anxious and nervous about the meeting tomorrow~  I kinda already know what to expect, but then I don't...I am definitely looking forward to it.    ~~the suspense~~....dum, dum duuummmm!  >_

      Just came back not too long ago.  I went to watch ~Raising Helen~.  I really liked this movie.  I actually cried during the movie (i know~...)but it felt very real.    One may never know when they'll leave and when you do, will you have a "Will" prepared?  Will you entrust your kids to your carefree sister to care for? And in this movie, love does peak around the corner when you're not looking for it.    Never say never...with a blink of an eye you can be a mother to three kids, lose your good-paying job, lose all your freedon, be a pastor's girlfriend and find what is really, truly the most important to you~  >_

      It's been pretty busy since Bren came home.  Been out to meet up with different groups of friends, before we leave on our trip.    I didn't have to work yesterday...yes, no work on Saturday!!  I took it off to attend my relative's wedding.  It also marked my first day of vacation~ yeah!!  Since Wednesday, I have been getting excited for my trip >_  But before I left work, I was able to settle on the venue of our company summer gathering and booked it for July 18th.  I hope everything turns out well, since it's the first time I am part of the group organizing it.  I want it to be a great success >_  Yesterday's wedding was very nice.  The bride was beautiful...she went back to HK to make all of her gowns for the evening.  Another cool thing was that her best friend was her wedding planner (she has her own business!).  So at the reception she went around handing out her card to all the single girls and their parents...gay eh?   Well, I guess i'll update again when I get back...I hope you guys will fill me in on all I've missed when I get back...and of course I'll do the same >_  England here I come ~

      I'M BACK~  My flight landed around 3:15pm yesterday.  I had a small scare at the airport, almost got searched!!  I didn't buy much so i don't know why i was scared...i guess it's just the fact my sisters and I were sent down that corridor.    Once I got out, my uncle called from England (perfect timing) to make sure we got home safely..lol.  Then Bonnie called, she just decided to try calling to see if i was back yet (wow, YOU are sooo good...i was surprised!).  Then there was Mitch..he somehow forgot I was on vacation and then when he decided to give me a call, he got a hold of me again, right after I got out of the airport.  You guys must miss me...j/k.  I'll just give you guys a brief overview of my trip.  I went for 13 days, left Sunday 13th from Toronto and arrived in London Monday 14th around 11:00am.  Headed back to the London house to drop off our luggage and then headed to another airpot to catch our flight to Paris.  Spent Monday and Tuesday in Paris headed home to London Tuesday night.  Wednesday we flew to Venice, stayed in London on Thursday and flew out to Milan on Friday.  Saturday and Sunday was spent in Cambridge and London.  Monday we flew to Salzburg, Austria and stayed over night there, came back to London Tuesday night.  Stayed in Central London Wednesday and Thursday and then came home on Friday.  I visited a total of 8 airports (including Toronto's very own Pearson)in a matter of 13 days...it was NUTS!!  I will give further details once I see you all >_

      I have been very lazy these couple of days.  I have only been going to the gym once a week.  Instead, I have been going out to a lot of dinners (summerlicious + others).  Work has been boring and slow, every one is on vacation or at the cottage, I wanna go away again!!  A cruise sounds very tempting right now~  As you all might have guessed, I have NOT studied yet.  I AM worried about my exam, but I am also even more worried about getting ALL my fits done in time.  Although I have many friends helping me out with the fits, I am still short.  And, just the other day I was talking to one of my classmates and he told me that the hard fits I am doing now MAY NOT count, since there aren't any follow up procedures taking place.  ~I am quite worried~  I am also spending more time planning the company event, since it's cutting close.  I am organizing the prizes and stuff now.  I hope everything turns out well and people actually enjoy this year's event...there is pressure to make this thing happen and added pressure to make it "different" and better than the past years.  I haven't been partying much these days, I kinda miss going nuts and having "fun".  I guess I am getting older.  Some of my friends no longer want to go out to clubs, bars, karaoke bars to drink and play.  I think they much prefer to chill and relax, which I don't mind.  But, I guess it's because I am not ready to settle yet, haven't found a reason to, so I still want to be out and about~ >_

      ~Long Weekend~  Sat: Went to Afterlife for Nicole's B-day bash. This chickie had 250 VIP guestlist and free champagne...miss popularity~ She introduced me to her 7 groups of friends throughout her short life span of only 23 years...haha. I was happy to see Minh, he hasn't changed a bit...we have to get cracking and study! I'm glad Stephy came with me, we represented the company and Niki's friends group #8...lol >_  Sun: Went to Ashbridges Bay for BBQ and a fun day in the sun. We met at Elsa's place, transfered the goodies into Josh's car, stopped by to pick up ice and off we went. The beach was packed!! All the girls were dropped off, while the boys went to find parking (it was nuts~ but i expected it). After much scouting around, we finally found a free grill. By the time we all settled it was 2:30pm. Stephy lead the boys to start the fire...lol...it was hilarious. Thanks to Lily, we had some yummy chicken~ I really have to learn how to marinate meat.  The girls chilled, while the boys played ball and cooked. I came home with a burnt back, 2 mosquito bites and a filled up tummy >_  Mon: Slept in --> finished writing up my contact fits --> went to photocopy them --> went to have them signed by the supervising optician --> came home --> heading out to dinner soon --> hopefully I will get some studying done tonight >_

      I was such a good girl this weekend. As time is cutting close, I actually stayed at home to study Friday and Saturday. I know I can always have BBT with the girls and dinner with others after my test. This is actually the first weekend I sat down and seriously looked at my notes...it's a start~  Sunday, I attended a wedding all day. The ceremony was held at Sangri-La. The place looks crappy from the outside, but when I entered the courtyard I was surprised. It was nicely decorated with a purple theme (very pretty).  Beautiful flowers, a small fountain, a little bridge and a row of white tents.  The weather was extremely nice on Sunday. The sun was beaming on us the entire time...i think i got burnt again, as I didn't expect the ceremony to be outside, so no sunscreen was applied :( The reception was held at Ruby Restaurant. Once again, I saw many aunties and uncles who have seen me "mature into the lady I am today"...lol...oh, please! My parents again were hounded with the typical questions, which of course they don't have the answers for~ There will definitely be many more weddings coming up very soon. I forsee at least 3 scheduled for next year >_
