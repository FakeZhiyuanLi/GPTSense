      Hey Shayna,  I need to order a new trapeze, online somewhere I guess but my searches have been confusing. I found Bobby's Big Top but I am reticent to order something I don't have a picture of. Any ideas? Could you post this pretty please? I'm looking for a single, made to order.  Hey Raven,  Look at Unicycle, the french equipment company. Their english language address is http://www.unicycle.fr/intro21.htm. They are the best and quite affordable. They are trusted and dependable and have everything you could ever need.   -Shayna

      Hi Shayna,  I was hoping to get a little advice from you. The studio I do trapeze at bought a hoop (I think I told you about it when you were still in Chicago).  Not having worked with a hoop, I don't know what to say about it but since you are a hoop master, I figured you would know.  I think the reason for the wrapping is because the hoop had all this black dust that would get on everyone. We would like some help figuring out how to prep it.  We tried bicycle tape but that didn't work out very well.  What should we use or do we even need to wrap it?  :)  Got any advice? Much appreciated, Jenn  Hey Jenn,  Yeah, you definately need to wrap the hoop. I just use athletic tape from the drug store--like in the first aid section. However, lots of brands of tape totally suck and the glue oozes though and sticks to your hands and dust sticks to the hoop and it's a mess. You can either experiment with different brands of tape, or paint the hoop with a tempra paint after you wrap it. This gives the tape a better grip than tape alone, since the paint is a bit gritty. I think the French circus eqipment company Unicycle sells good tape but you have to order it off the internet. Paint is cool cuz you can make it any color.  I've also seen some people out here on the west coast who have hoops covered in long strips of velvet. This looks really nice, and feels good, but I've never worked on a velvet covered hoop for a long period of time.  Whatever you do though, tape from the middle of the bottom of the hoop to the top, then do the other side, rather than just taping all the way around in one direction. This way the tape won't roll up under your hands on one side. It's hard to explain, but trust me--start and the bottom and work your way up.

      Today I almost died. For real. I fell off the Russian Swing. Not like before, where I've gone off the swing and crashed into the water...I never even made it into the air.  Now this will be hard to explain if you've never done swing (and you probably haven't), but try to stay with me. When the swing is at the height I want it I think to myself "On the next swing I'll call 'hup'". However, this time the swing was even higher on my hup swing. Basicly, you know when you're on the swings at the park and you butt comes off? That's what happened to my feet. However, they never really went back on. I slipped off the swing and got sucked into the ground below the swing (You know how I always say to do tricks at the tops of your trapeze swings? Cuz the force is so great at the bottom of the swing? Yeah, it's like that.) I smashed into the ground, hitting my knees and face on the concrete. All I heard was Rebecca yelling "STAY DOWN!!!" See, the swing is still swinging and it would have hit me if I'd tried to get up. No thoughts were going through my head for the first few seconds. Nothing. Then I felt the pain. I put my hands on my face and thought "Oh my God I broke my jaw!" Then I felt my knees. "Oh my god, I broke my kneecaps." I heard someone yelling "STOP THE SHOW!!!" Once it hit me that I was still alive, I realized I was also relatively okay! I told them not to stop the show, but they did anyway and the announcer said "Ladies and gentlemen, due to the nature of this injury we will be canceling the rest of the show". Then "the performer will recieve onsite medical attention". I'M telling THEM not to worry as the strapped me to a back board and carried me off the island and onto a boat. At the dock the med team was waiting to cut my costume off, but I sat up and said I was okay. Then, I realized I really was. I stood up and walked to med services, got some ice and told them I'd do the next show. they told me that, no, I'd take the rest of the day off.  The best part is that we got it all on video! Sweet! (Injury list--split chin, bruised knees, sore jaw. Baby stuff.)  All this in the quest for a triple. Three flips in the air. I don't see what is so hard about this and I'm starting to get very frusterated. I feel like I am SO close. Monday I crashed into the water 4 times in a row. Twice I had it...SO SO SO CLOSE!!! The other two times my mind wandered on me. This is my main problem---I get in the air and rush or panic and bail out of it and crash. I want to be know for throwing good tricks, not having the most insane crashes! I want my fellow cast members to respect my talent, not my quick recovery time or slight madness or grit. I mean, those things are fine and well, but they are the traits of a loose cannon, not a valued performer.  They say the pressure to throw big tricks is down this year, but I am so competitive that I want to be a top jumper. I don't need 10 people daring me to go, I only need one person to look down her nose at me and I won't rest until I've proven that I am just as good as anyone else.  Why can't I just let it go and relax? It's not worth dying. It's not even the stress and laying awake at night running the tricks in my head. Why can't I be more like the people who think "I get paid the same weather I do or don't?" Well, to me it's not about the money, it's about being good and being respected and being the best I can be. It's hard for me to accept that maybe this IS the best I can be. Maybe I'll give it a month. Back off the triple a bit. Give it time to think I've given up.   Or maybe I'll try again tomorrow.

      Hearing stories about my colaborators lives back home would make me proud and happy if I were a bigger person, and I'm not saying it doesn't, but I'm also endlessly jealous. It's not that I lack creativity or motivation, but I lack SPACE! Physical space to roll around in and fly in and make a mess in. I just read Raven's blog (www.livejournal.com/users/ravinia) and amost cried. ALMOST. That girl has got it going on in ways I can only dream of. I wish I was doing a 20 minute trapeze act. I wish I'd touched a trapeze for 20 min in the last 3 months.  Then Raven drops the bomb-diddly. She's moving to New Orleans and leaving me her amazing pratic space. 6000 sq feet, a stage, 23 ft ceilings. $50 a month. Shit. Now what? San Diego was supposed to be a summer job. I had every intention of going home and producing a show all my own. With that space I could, so easily. I feel like I'm withering here, and fooling myself into thinking I could stay and be happy. And then I think, "Chicago?" Nobody in their right minds leaves So Cal to spend the winter in Chicago!  There is so much aerial dance happening there right now. I have an offer to dance with AMEBA if I go back, a job with Midnight Circus, gigs lined up already, fucking amazing friends, my family, people ready to perform with me, the training space of my dreams. Here I have an ocean and a boyfriend and a dog and a contract that ends in Sept. and I'm freaking out.

      Finally, we have a computer and internet access and I can send a new update without worrying about overdrawing my bank account...      Our show starts next weekend and the pressure is on to get big tricks so we can be scheduled a lot. At least, that was the plan and until Wednesday that's what I seemed to be doing (on Russian Swing anyhow...Chinese Poles, I've given up on--I'm clearly the Average Avenger on that). I was consitantly throwing two-and-a-halves (two forward flips and a dive) with a call-out (the trainer yells "HUP" for when you should stop flipping and start diving. Then, he told me to do it without a HUP and I totally faced it. Belly flop from about 30 feet. I came up screaming and gasping for air...everyone swam out and pulled me in. It's funny cuz people crash daily and everyone kind of stands around for a second before going to help...knowing this I came up screaming "HELP!!! COME GET ME!!!" My boobs hurt SO bad! I knew if I didn't do it again right away I never would, so I tried again and did a greta one. That night I had a horrible headache and tight chest...a bit dizzy and nauseaus. I think I may have a concussion.      The next day, I did the same thing again...like an instant replay of the day before, only the wind got knocked out of me even harder and I swallowed a bunch of water. Before I knew it I was on a boat going back to the break room.Thanks to my performance everyone else called it a day. The lining on my bathing suit is ripped to shreads because of the impact! Pretty hardcare. Damn swing. We've decided to name it Sybil because of it's many and quickly-changing personalities.      The crazy people here are everywhere...I guess California has a really bad mental health system, as well as a huge and un-cared-for homless population. Riding for my apartment to the gym the other night I got no less that 7 comments yelled at me from people on the street, be they yuppies hanging out in the "gaslamp" (the grossly gentrified soulless part of downtown) or crazies. At least the crazies have an excuse. The other day I picked up a package from the post office and I was opening it on the steps outside when this huge biker guy comes up and starts talking to me about my "ink". He's like, "the only ink I got is prison ink" (as though I would be impressed). Then he goes off about how big my arms are..."Damn, your arms are bigger than mine, dog!" He calls me dog at least 7 times. I am ignoring him in the most obvious and rude way possible. Then I put my bike helmet on and he says "Oh, dog, you got a helmet on...does that mean I can punch you in the head?" Finally I must break my vow of silence. "It absolutely does not!" Of course, he draws back his fist anyway and plants a good one on my skull. "WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? YOU CAN'T DO THAT, DOG!!!" He's defense is "You were wearing a helmet!!!" As I quickly rode away I could hear him going, "I'm not trying to pick you up or anything". Well, you could have fooled me...I usually fall fast for guys with jailhouse tattoos who call me dog and punch me in the head!      Well, those are most of my adventures. I'm getting really tired of wearing a track suit all week and I feel like I can't put together a cool outfit to save my life. Grrrr...I'm starting to really get along with the rest of the people in the show. Everyone has turned out to be really cool. We hang out on weekends and have barbeques. Oh, happy california. I miss Chicago, so much.

      My last email, as I said to Carrie, wasn't supposed to be so sad sounding. I feel like, living the life I live, that I don't have a lot of room to feel sorry for myself. The previous email was more meant to explain how I feel like the bad things in my life happen to A) make the good things look even better and B) remind me that it could all be a hell of a lot worse.      The Extreme Physical Pain I'm feeling right now however could not possibly be a lot worse. My arms feel like they were switched to the opposite shoulder in my sleep. In fact, the other night I woke up and couldn't feel my right arm AT ALL. It wasn't even like it was asleep--I honestly thought for a moment it was gone. I pawed around for it in the dark with my other hand but didn't realize I was touching it for a number of minutes, until I made out the shape of five small hot dogs and figured those must be my fingers. I grabbed the flobby, dead thing and flipped it over and massaged it until finally I felt a tingle. Ugh, just thinking about it makes me want to hurl.      This hurly feeling is similar to standing next to the Russian swing, getting ready to take my turn. In case you don't know, Russian Swing is like the Pirate Ship ride at the amusement park--the one that swings higher and higher untiil it goes up and over the bar and around--only smaller and not piratey. And standing is not only allowed, but required--as is jumping off at the top, over 10 feet of big rocks and into the bay. With a good swing it launches you 30 or 40 feet in the air. Depth of water? Oh, 6-15 feet, depending on tides. Thus far I have only jumped. My goals are to throw a double front (two front flips in the air) and a brani in-back out (a front flip with a half twist into a back flip) by the time show opens in June. Hopefully I'll get over that "Today I might die" feeling soon. We also started Chinese Poles (which I'm pretty decent at, though it KILLS my shoulders) and tumbling. We tumble on a sprung track on a dock, but no one warned us that our wet wetsuits add about 10-15 lbs. As Little Gay Closeted Paul says up to 50 times a day, "good times!".      I've made a few friends who have been kind enough to show me around and let me use their computers. Mostly, though, I'm still wandering around alone. Well, actually, I'm mostly comming home exhausted, eating a hunk of cheese and falling asleep at 8:30.      Whitney Hubbs is funny and pretty and smart and the best artist I've ever met and has been my best friend since I was 15. (How was that Whit? Happy?)      My mom calls me every 4 hours to ask where things are and if I've been to such and such a restaurant/beach/hotel yet. She's planning her trip out to visit and afraid I'll break my skull and trying to quit smoking all at once. It's nice to know she cares...I desperately want to come home for a weekend. Tickets are cheap and I can walk to the airport. I have little fantasies about walking into the Circus Factory or Brown Elephant or Handlebar and suprising everyone. Sigh...I guess I'll just do that in Sept. Everyone says I'll fall in love with San Diego and never come back, but I think I'd have to get a boob job and go tanning and turn into a backstabbing bitch (rather than a straight-up honest bitch)  in order to really fit in here. The aerial girls seem mean--oh, no that's not fair and I'm just jealous. I'm over there watching their workout and dying to get up on a trapeze...UGH!!! Luckly they put in into this aerial act called Diamond (It's some giant prism shaped trapeze thing) as a sub.   Anyhow...things are much better, though I'm still lonely. I guess I'm just getting used to it. Reading and sleeping a lot help. I'm actually off to a party, so maybe some breakdancing will ensue...oh yeah, I can't move my arms...

      (This is a copy of the first email I sent out after arriving alone in San Diego at the beginning of April.)  There's a lot of crackheads, whom I encounter on the walk from my apartment to the cool-kids vegan chorizo burrito place, or thrift store, or post office or library. This is a downhill walk, and the optimists point this out when I complain about living at the top of a full-on California style hill (we're not talking Damen bridge...). If it were reversed I would ride home with a bag full of beer and mangos balanced off each handlebar and whatever strange "art" I found in a dumpster sticking out of my backpack as I glide down the hill, but as it is  I generally dismount and push.  Today, after my first day at Sea World/Beer Land (it's owned by Anheuser/Busch--which I could never have spelled before today. They have a beer school!) I left feeling lonelier than I had since arriving. All the people know eachother from previous years and while they are nice enough I still felt like the geeky new girl in all the wrong clothes, trying to get in on their conversations and find out as much insider info in my infamous eavesdroppy way as possible. I kept thinking, "You know you don't have to try so hard, you've done this a million times now and you always end up with a great bunch of friends", but I still hopped on my bike to ride home with tears leaking out of my eyes. I always always ALWAYS feel this way when I first get somewhere--though, I guess I didn't last summer at Smirkus. I just kept reminding myself of this, while alternately swearing at cars and city planners (the "bike route" runs along a pratical freeway!) and shooting snot rockets.   When I saw Home Depot my spirits brightened! I'd been wondering when I'd happen upon it's bright orange rays! I quickly ran down a mental list of what I need for my apartment (lamp globes, toilet paper, curtains, paint, towel rod) and my bank balance (something like $200?) and emerged a few hours later with all the equipment needed to build a hand-balancing platform and a bucket to put on my new bike rack (on my new bike) to carry it all home. A bungee here, a bungee there  and I hoped on to finish the long, horrifying ride home. Seconds later it all came crashing down. DAMNASS!!! Okay, breathe...put the wood and pipes in my bag, towel and sweatshirt in the bucket. Carefull....okay go. A few miles later, next to the navy base entrance, the strap on my bag breaks off. I'd just minutes before been thinking of how long I've had this messenger bag...since way back in those shitty Portland days. Bag falls, I fall, right next to the off ramp into the base. Sit on the street. Cry. Swear. Check my phone messages. Hear Garth and Ari's sweet voices. Feel a bit better. Tie bag together. Akwardly begin the ride home and it starts to rain. Suddenly, ahead of me is an insane bus crash and I realize that had I not stopped to cry and fix my bag, there's a really good chance I would have been in the middle of it. I think of the times things like this have happened before (i.e. 18yrs old--Arrested train hopping only to find I avoided being involved in a derailment.) In San Diego. IN SAN DIEGO!!! That's not supposed to happen here and especially not when I've had such a bad day! OH LOOK!!! IT'S THE GIANT MOUNTIAN/CLIFF UP TO MY APARTMENT!!! I dismount and push, I am home. But before I get in the door my bike falls over one last time just for posterity sake.  It's not all bad. In fact, little of it is. Yesterday I rode my bike up and down 30 miles of beach. This weekend I'm learning to surf. I know I'm a better earliest than those snotty bungee girls and that what I'm doing is harder anyway...I don't have to prove myself. Ugh. It's beautiful and warm, even when it's ugly and cold. I miss Chicago. I miss hanging out. I miss the Handlebar and Scrabble. But I'm maybe performing at a fashion show and showing off some of my designs, too. And soon I'll get to fly off a giant swing into the ocean and everything will then be crystallized into perfectness.  And then I'll be stung by a jellyfish.   But I"ll be pulled from the water just in time to miss a shark attack.  Such is my life.

      Three months ago I would have responded to this party questions with "I'm a trapeze artist" without feeling untruthful at all. Now, 3000 miles away from the icy-hot of Chicago, amid the endless mediocrity of San Diego, I'm not so sure. I haven't touched a trapeze in what feels like ages. Are you still what you are even if you're not doing what you do? If my hands and feet are getting soft and decent-looking again can I still claim to be an expert--an authority on all things aerial?  I didn't move here to lose my identity, I moved here to expand it. So, responding "I'm an acrobat" shouldn't be a step back, but it feels like it. I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW that I will come out of this experience a stronger circus performer with insane skills I couldn't have learned anywhere else, but I miss the feeling of spending more than 3 seconds disconnected from the earth.  I guess I have to go back a few years to explain how important this identity is to me, how I acquired it and why I chase it all over the world...  But we'll get to that. I'm all about the here and now, for better or worse or worse or worse (as it sometimes seems). I'm a professional snap decision maker and so here I am, in Sunny San Diego. All the right places at right times conspired to bring me here--now I wonder if maybe the wrong places and wrong times don't secretly hold some merit.  I auditioned for this show on a whim in February. I found out a month later that I had the part and would leave for San Diego in 3 weeks. Garth and I had been dating for about 2 months at that point. I asked him to join me and he did. Now, here we are, living at the top of a hill. Out my kitchen window I can see the ocean 3 miles away.   Paradise? I don't think so. San Diego hasn't really grown on me, what with the yuppies and crackheads just outside my door, the terrible public transportation system and even more terrifying bike lanes. High rent (I pay $100 more here for a studio than I did for a 2 bedroom in Chicago). Jet fuel in the drinking water. And that ocean outside the window...it's actually the bay.  But I'm trying to make the most of it. Learn as many new circus skills as I can and maybe make some connections to get work after this contract ends in September. So I could stay here, I guess. See, Chicago never grew on Garth. What to do at the end of the summer is an underlying current of uncertainty in our relationship.  So I guess this is the story of a girl who still prefers to say "trapeze artist" in her endless quest to be something slightly more complex than that. Where will she go? Where has she been? What will become of her? Ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages, please direct your focus to the top of the big top, where the girl of many hair-colors hangs from her toes! How will she get down? Nobody knows!

      Not being able to move my torso makes my mind wander more. I start creating elaborate plans for when I'm healed. Fantisize about the show I want to produce, about moving to England and joining a dirty mud show. I think off all the things I could do instead of laying in bed feeling sorry for myself. My ideas are elaborate and my energy is ill-equiped to handle them. I could put together a whole show about injuries. People performing around them. I'd choreograph a dance called "Intercostal" about how bad it hurts. Me trying to sit at the computer for an exended period of time. Me trying to lay down in bed. Trying to get up.  I'd choreograph about how much it hurts to sit still. Not just physically, but mentally. This is the stillest I can every remember being. The most passive. The quietest. Brian was here for a week and we couldn't even wrestel once. It hurts to yell. I love yelling.  At some point I stop daydreaming all these ideas, though. Choreograph a dance? I have nowhere to perform it here. Move to England and join a show? I have a boyfriend, the kind I've always hoped for. Do I just give that up? Distance has been bad to me.  No one warned me about this little problem when I made my career choice. "Somewhere along the line, Shayna, you night fall in love." No one thought to tell me. I'd been so adament about not dating other "circus people" because I wanted to stay connected to other parts of my life (i.e. rock and roll, dude). But now ? Am I really going to have to make a choice?  I miss Smirkus. I miss Vermont. I miss Chicago. I miss the Midnight Circus. I miss everything that is not here and is not possible right now.

      I'm pretty over San Diego. Laying in bed in pain, moving around in pain. Not being able to spoon my boyfriend. Going to work parties and feeling even more left out than usual. Knowing all I have to look forward to is the expansion of my stomach and thighs as my muscles turn into fat. Not having any friends in this city. Missing all I had back home. Wondering if I'll actually recover and be able to fly again. Worrying about weather my worker's comp checks will actually come through.  I find myself feeling enormously depressed and fantisizing about all the self-destructive ways I could pass the time until I A) heal, B) die, C) go back to Chicago. Everyone tells me that now is the time to focus on other aspects of my creativity, but I don't want to. Those aspects are supplamentary...I use fashion design and "performance art" and whatnot to justify spending time on "circus arts". Circus has an illigitimate status as an art and sometimes I fall for it. I believe that I'm not an artist but a freak and doing other art makes me feel like I'm still "arty". But my passion is in flight and grounded I feel worthless.  I'm tired of challenges. I'm tired of being thrown for a loop.   My back hurts. I hate my life.
