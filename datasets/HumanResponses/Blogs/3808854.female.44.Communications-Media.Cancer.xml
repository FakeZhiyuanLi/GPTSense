      Ok, so I may not quite have the hang of this self-publishing thing yet.&nbsp; I received my first paperback from CafePress and proudly showed it to my family. Published! I was published! I had an actual book, with actual pages and a real cover! I was thrilled.   Unfortunately, I never actually read the manuscript again after formatting it for CafePress. Of course, it was my nephew who noticed that the last line of every page was missing. Oy! I tried to convince him that it was my enigmatic tribute to James Joyce, but he wasn't fooled. He knew there'd been a screw-up somewhere and that I was no doubt involved.   So -- lesson learned. Always read your manuscript one last time before having your book bound. And before waving your pet project in front of your relatives' faces.&nbsp;   Score so far: Technology -1. Downtrodden would-be writer --0. Back to the drawing board.

      The first thing I learned after stumbling&nbsp;&nbsp;blindly into online publishing is that there's a huge differerence between ebook sites.&nbsp; One of my books -- Dark New World -- was accepted by PulpBits, a new e-publisher. While they were very polite, their editing job wasn't what I expected from professionals. They also didn't do much in the way of advertising (as far as I could tell).&nbsp; When I googled the name of my book, not a single reference to Pulpbits showed up. So, nice as the PulpBits people were, I didn't see any point in keeping my book with them.  &nbsp;  My second book -- Eternal Cafe -- was accepted by DLSIJ, a site that highlights female writers. I felt more comfortable with the professionalism of the editor and with the level of advertising that they do on behalf of their writers. I've enjoyed working with DLSIJ, but I've found that the outside world in general doesn't seem to be ready for ebooks.&nbsp; For a year I've been trying to get a review of Eternal Cafe, only to find that most respected reviewers aren't interested in reading an ebook.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  In an attempt to increase my chances of being reviewed, I've set up a paperback copy of Eternal Cafe through CafePress, a print-on-demand company. I'm still waiting for my sample copy to arrive, so I can't form an opinion of CafePress yet -- other than the fact that the site is easy to use and creating my own 'shop' hasn't been too hard. I needed some help with formatting from a friend, but basically it was pretty self-explanatory .  &nbsp;  If the reviewers aren't ready for ebooks, I don't know if they're ready for self-publishing. I guess we'll find out soon enough.

      A year ago, I published an ebook called Eternal Cafe. After years of struggle, I thought I had finally made it. I was published! My life was complete. And it was. For awhile. Until I figured out that publishing is only half of the battle. In fact, it's the easiest part.   What's harder than writing a book and getting it accepted for publication? Marketing it! So now, after a year of basking in the dimly warm glow of being a published, but unknown, writer, I've decided to actually try to dive into that great unknown abyss known as the Market.   To make it more interesting, I'm giving myself one year to make Eternal Cafe a known entity in the publishing world. And to make it even more interesting, I'm going to do as much of my marketing as I can online.   So, this is my task. Market or perish. Could be an interesting year.
