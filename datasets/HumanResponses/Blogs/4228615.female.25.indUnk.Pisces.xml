        It's the beginning of the new week. And i have decided to put to a stop to it, thou it's gonna hurt but to do it now will stem off further damages that will arise in future.I'm sure I can handle it.       There's this new gal who join us today as an assistant manager in Corporate Communication. She has the looks of PLU. Well, if she really turns out to be one, i will be thrilled. Will do the testing soon. It's not that hard to tell.   Time will reveal all truth  . Let's wait and see.       Going to Maxwell to have dinner with the cute guys, AA n Jeff. They just came back from HK. I just missed their companionships. They are two great guys one could never miss.       Till then.

       Had an eventful Saturday. Caught two movies in a row - AVP n Clouds in the Coffee. My advice for these two shows is, if u have nowhere to spend the bucks,then u can go for it.      Was at CnC last night, with S,SJ and   Her  . Supposedly SJ arranged to meet up with Chase. We saw her there but she left shortly after that. And guess who we bumped into? It's KK,J n QY. Me being the stuck-up or black-faced (as they had branded me) refused to go up and say hi to them. SJ being articulate went up to them to chat them up. Surprisingly,   She   din go up to them to even say hi, given that   she   used to fall for QY.      Had a fun night,S was always so full of laughter. With her around, you just cant stop laughing with her jokes and the way she handles people. By the way, she's straight at the moment (she was a les before). Most of the dykes out there want check her out. Hahaha~! We even got a jug of beer on the house all thanks to her. Well Done!      Had booked a hotel, The Keong Saik Hotel for SJ. The quality of that hotel was way below the standard. Well, how to complain when actually we are paying $60 per night. Anyhow, i din sleep well in that. As usual, i cant have my good sleep when out of my home.       Was home early, so tired that i knocked out again. SJ has gone to meet up her uncle and to put her stuffs over at their place as she's gonna stay over there tonight. We are going to meet F and SC later in Chinatown for a dinner before proceeding to Hotel 1929 for the mini birthday celebration.      Slacker now.

         Question : Why do gals need to wear skirts?     Can folks out there answer this question for me?        Well, as the people around me know that i DON'T wear skirts. The only time that they have seen me in skirts was old school time, i wore the school uniform. Count yourself lucky if u saw me in them.Ha! I have never wore any skirt since poly time. Even till today, i work in a corporate place, i din even convince myself to wear them. However, lately i'm under a lot of pressure cos the people around me in my workplace always bring up this topic about transforming me into a more feminine icon. They are suspecting already especially my boss. She even try to sound JW out on whether do i have a boyfriend or am i in dating some guy at the moment.        It's quite true that most lesbians,more andro-type or butchy-type don't like to wear skirts. Agree? So it's kinda of connected to your sexuality, if people who have friends whom are lesbians, they should be to identify   US   quite easily. I reckon that some of the fellow colleagues in my company are smarter, their antenna are working, our being the 'gaydar'. They should be able to tell i'm not the normal type of gals. Moreover, i hang out closely with AA. He's an obvious. Colleagues do come up to me and try to dig informations on him, interested to know whether he's a   GAY  .       Anyhow,   Silence is Easy  . To me, workplace is workplace. Should not bring personal feelings to work,vice versa. Not getting myself too involved.   Work is just work  .

         Yup ! I'm still in office. Jeez... Just finished my kickboxing session. It was good. Sometimes, you just feel so energetic after exercising. It really perks me up.        I wonder why there are still so many of my colleagues left in the office, all gals. Six of us, the usual company that stay behind to work till late. Since i was promoted, i join in the 'work-late' club. Before that, i always knock off on time, 5.30pm to be exact. Now, it's impossible for me to go home so early. The earliest that i could get away is 6.30pm. But somehow, i like this kinda of lifestyle. I wanted to occupy myself with work. Get up,go to work,sleep...the cycle just repeat.       I'm looking forward to this coming weekend coz SJ is coming in to SG. We've planned to go clubbing and she gonna stay over at my place if she cannot find accommodation. And movie,makan,etc... Yippeeee......       All right. Time to get my ass off my chair now and head home. But i'm not tired. Gonna watch Sex and The City. Yup! That should be my plan when i reach home.

        Feeling so restless, no mood to work. Going to stay late in office as i need to go for my kickboxing, has not been going for a few weeks liao.         I'm starting to lose interest in   her  . I think this is what   she   wants me to react.   She   treats me cold. Well, i really am not in the mood to pursue anything except career. I'm so emotionally drained given the past relationship i had. I need a break, to take a step behind and enjoy my singlehood.       Three Cheers to Singlehood!!!

        I'm glad that i am back now, at home, chilling. I didnt sleep well last night due to pre-stage fright blues, had my maiden presentation in the morning.   God Damn It  ! I swear, i nearly freaked out in front of the conference room,delivering my presentation. Nonetheless, it went smoothly, 3 lines of sweat. And i have to do this every month, my boss was telling me, i'm gonna be seasoned by the many many presentations to come.        SJ is back from NZ but yet she has not called me abt meeting up. I MISS HER sooooooo much!!! Gosh! It seems like yesterday that we first met each other, it has been a year. SJ was introduced to Jo n me by ST. Now only left SJ and me still in contact, the rest of the people in the group or we got to know at that time has vanished into thin air. How time flies .   I wonder how is   she   getting on these two days. No news from   her  . I dont want to call or sms   her   as i think   she   need to be alone or have   her   own space, as what   she   mentioned in   her   blog. Wanted to help   her   but i have my limits as well.      We are going to celebrate F's birthday this Sun at 1929 Hotel, hmm...am thinking to invite SJ to join us as she know F too. How sweet of SC to plan this surprise for her gf. Soooo envious!       Gotta get some rest now!

       Oh Sunday, Sunday....Just bought a new book,   Angels And Demons   by Dan Brown.  Wah!  It really is a nice book, I'm already feeling the suspense building up even thou i have just started reading it. Was tempted to buy The Da Vinci Code as well but met an acquaintance of AA, hmm...he bought that book...was thinking that we can exchange it after reading..well,gotta get his contact first...  Messaged   Her   asking whether would   she   be interested to catch a show later..but till now, i havent got any reply.   She   has a habit of not replying   her   msgs instantly .  I have not seen   her   for 5 days, kinda of miss   her  . We have been hanging out a lot since we first met. These 5 days were the longest that we did not managed to meet up. Well, I'm thinking too much. After all, we are just friends,according to   her.        Monday is coming, and i hate it. Got to make my   maiden presentation   on Tuesday for GBU. Kinda of nervous. My boss was kind enough to help me present for the last two GBUs, given that i'm very new to the job. This time round, she wanted me to be able to handle it.   I gotta prove it!

        Yes!! This is  REAL !! I'm posting my ever first blog here after feeling that my memory space in my brain is getting much much shorter each day i get older...*Sigh*...So i hope by blogging here, i can re-visit the individual day that i had passed 3 days,3 months,3 years later...        Gosh!! I dont know why, somehow i feel that as i get older, I tend to speak more to my inner self... Do you people out there believe that there's inner voice in each self? Myself, here do reckon this "voice" do exist... I like to talk to this "voice" cos sometimes u just cant find the right person or the right timing to say what you wanted to say at that very moment... Well, you can say that i'm getting abit eccentric but never mind.
