      I wrote this one during study:  Tapered crawl, perpetual silence Fallen angels lonely weep  Death of an idol, cautious king Thinking draws you in too deep  Bleeding thoughts, demons promise Serenade a lover sweet  Keep always truth outside your being If it's the Devil you wish to beat  Can't be screwed writing anything right now, though I think I should note I may have f**ked up royally at work.  Fingers crossed though.  And please don't ask.

      I was bored in typing so I wrote these:  Invisible consequences, creeping over your consciousness Through every pore and into your soul What you think it is, is irrelevant What we know it is, is of importance  See how you feel Know how you perceive it Courtship through desire Corruption through alignment  Never known another walk Always believed in your intuition Feel the power of Death You will burn forever    'Ode to Love (or the lack there of)'   Fragmented memory of how you felt Touch of red in your voice How you hold her when she cries Comfort never held such truth  Don't scream, don't feel Awkward Anxiety Don't fall, don't tell Thoughtful Toxicity In the end she will know  Rushing blues without inspiration Seek the child of destiny Open your eyes to the real world Without the thought of a memory  Don't scream, don't feel Awkward Anxiety Don't fall, don't tell Thoughtful Toxicity Is it really better to know  She tainted you with her dreams Mispronounced and rearranged Escape her heart, her burning touch Drown within your sorrow  Don't scream, don't feel Awkward Anxiety Don't fall, don't tell Thoughtful Toxicity Do you really wanna know  Bleeding, burning, drowning, feeling Do you really wanna know  Don't scream, don't feel Awkward Anxiety Don't fall, don't tell Thoughtful Toxicity In the end she know   As you can see I am completely against working in class at the moment.

      Well it appears that  urlLink Jonathan  has given me the wrong video because I haven't seen the episode before the first one on the tape.  I hope that made sense.  Now I'm really bored.    I'm downloading some songs now.   urlLink Leith  told me to download 'Poison the Well - Tonight'.  It's downloading pretty fast.  It better be good.  Actually, I'm gonna be positive.  It WILL be good.  What else should I do?

      I'm still not at school.  I should go, but I really can't be screwed.  I think I'll just take the day off.  But I better go for fifth period to continue 'working' on my English essay (AKA write some more poetry).  I'm so f**kin lazy.  It kinda pisses me off.  It's not like I have anything to do.  I know, I'll watch Angel.  I have about three episodes on tape that I've yet to watch.  Ooooh, I think Willow's in one of them!

      You told me you were going to post in your blog last night.  LIAR!!!  Current ... food I'm eating:  buttery toast songs I'm listening to:  Nirvana - The Man Who Sold the World/Rage Against the Machine - Testify/A Perfect Circle - Judith (remix) fav song:  Mars Volta - Televators  'I must have died alone, a long long time ago'

      It's really cold and I should be going to school right now but I can't be screwed. I'm already in a holiday state of mind even though the holidays don't start until next week.  GOD I CAN'T WAIT!!!  I don't have anything to say really other than ... no I have nothing.  I haven't eaten breakfast and I really ought to.  Ow my stomach is grumbling.  Shhhhhh stupid stomach!  School starts in 1 minute and I need to eat something so I should probably go.  'auto-de-fe, a capillary hint of red, only this manupod, crescent in shape has escaped'

      I'm feeling rather confused right now and I'm not sure why.  Or what I'm confused about.  Which just makes me feel more confused.  I'm going to Jenny J's house next Tuesday with  urlLink Rhedyn .  We're going to have a talk about how we are feeling.  I'm not sure how it's going to work though, as meaningful conversations usually just arise of their own free will.  We shouldn't expect too much to arise I suppose.  Anyway, here's a poem I wrote in English while I was supposed to be writing an essay:  Thoughts and dreams animosity Screams of lucid stare Blue without black harmony Bleeding halls and whispered clouds  We will find the true speech Nor shall you know his true name Without his soul your nature will never be Entranced and innoculated, your essence has crumbled  I don't really like it.

      Just to clear up the insatiable craving for milk thing.  Although I list veganism on my interests, I am not vegan.  I recently went vegetarian, and over the next few months I hope to phase all animal products out of my life.    It's gonna be hard but it's worth it.  I no longer want to contribute to the suffering and deaths of millions of animals world wide every year.    Maybe you can give me some vegetarian recipes.  Oh and I no longer crave milk.  In fact I haven't drunken it for a week now.  I have soy milk in my fridge.  It's kinda gross but I'll get used to it (I hope).

       urlLink Rhedyn  and I have strengthened our bond and have reached a new level in our friendship.  The  urlLink 'Hate Me, I'll Understand'  entry in my blog has brought us closer together.  She knows more about me than most now.  Our lives are similar.  We hide behind facades, masks that we create, so that we don't have to truly interact with out friends, so that we don't have to show our fears, worries and sadness, because we don't want to feel vulnerable.  But we want to take the masks off.  I am here for you Rhedyn, and I know that you are here for me too.

      The comments that were left on my blog have made me happy so now I'm gonna write about what I have been up to rather than my feelings.  Today I went to Billie-Anne's house.  I went to pick up the CDs she made me (she didn't bring them to work).  I'm listening to the first one at the moment.  The first song 'Bombs over Baghdad' by Outkast and Rage Against the Machine was good.  I also love the live acoustic version of 'The Hollow' by A Perfect Circle.  It is more mellow than the original yet more intense.  I worked tonight.  I usually only work Wednesday and Friday nights and all day Sunday, but I was called in because people were 'sick' (AKA going to the numerous balls that are on tonight).  I did some studying for my upcoming English assessment today.  We have to write an essay that must argue the following statement, 'And Lord Acton said, 'Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely'.  We have use examples from history, modern day and the novel we studied, 'Animal Farm' by George Orwell.  I don't know whether I'll pass.  Maybe I'm just being pessimistic.  I'm obsessed with blogs at the moment.  I have fourteen saved in my favourites!  And only three of those people are people I know!  I love reading other blogs, especially the insightful ones, and the ones by people that think like me.  I've left so many comments I've lost count.  And I've sent a couple of emails to tell the people how much I enjoy reading their blogs.  One woman sent back a reply saying '...thank you so much again for you very kind words. They are encouraging for me to keep writing.'  That was nice.  Current ... book I'm reading: Brilliance of the Mood song I'm listening to: Rent - Pet Shop Boys fav song: AFI - Silver and Cold

      I'm kinda sick of my friends and I slagging each other off.  Why can't we just accept one another for who we are.  Maybe once in a while we should think about all the reasons we are friends with one another, all the good points, rather than nit-picking.    Sometimes things are said as jokes, but most jokes have an element of truth  and they actually affect us in a negative way.  You probably think I'm crazy for saying stuff like this but I sort of don't care anymore.  I no longer want to be non-confrontational if it means ignoring my values. I'm in one of my moods again.  Maybe I'm just overly dramatic, but I'm still pissed about  urlLink that comment .

      I'm trying not make a thing about this but a certain person left a comment on one of my posts and it really pissed me off.  I feel angry that this person would feel that way towards me just because I feel compassion for others.  Yes, I may not display this behaviour in front of my 'friends' but that's only because I feel they would judge me, which is incredibly sad because they are, after all, my 'friends'.  This post may cause problems but I feel the need to express my feelings.

      God, it took so long for that last post to appear on the page.  I actually wrote it last night but it says I did it this morning because I republished it.  I'm in typing with Antz at the moment.  Mrs Blunt has let us have a entire period of free time because she has a headache or something and she wants to recover before the ball tomorrow night.  I'm not going.   urlLink Jonathan  went last year and he said it was really crap.  I'm going next year, only because it's my last year.  Working tonight, 4 till 8.  Just so you know, I'm a man whore (AKA Checkout Operator at Heaphy Terrace, New World).  Billie-Anne's working tonight, she swapped shifts with Kylie.  Oooooohhhhhh she made me a CD so she'll bring it hopefully.  I don't even know what's on it!  Oh yeah, thought I should mention, I'm hoping to move out soon.  I can't stand living with my Mum anymore.  It's not like I hate her but she yells and I don't respond well to yelling and I get really frustrated.  I suppose I'll have to go on that benefit for people who still go to school but are living away from home.  And I'll need to find flatmates.  I think I'll ring Surrey tonight ...

      Okay, so I don't really have suicidal urges, me or my 'sexy smile'.  I was just in a 'I suck, screw me' state of mind.  Actually, I was lying in bed with the light off and I suddenly got up, turned on the computer, connected to the internet, and started ranting!  The reason I feel crap is because there is so much crap in the world and I have an expectation of myself to fix it all, but I know I never could, which makes me kind of sad.  And because I've realised that I have to find my own 'truth', my own path, because their isn't one just laying there waiting for me.  Life sucks, but it could me so much worse.

      I hate myself.  There I said it.  I'm angry and confused and frustrated.  I am a continual disappointment to myself and others.  I have issues that I have no hope of resolving unless I figure out what they are.  AARRRRGGGHHH!!!  I'm stupid and lazy and overly indulgent and self-involved and unreasonably emotional and arrogant and pathetic and obsessive and useless and ungrateful and unimpressed and repressed and whingy and whiny and apathetic and secretive and ignorant and hypocritical and I have no sense of direction.  I don't understand what I'm doing or what I'm saying or where I'm going or ANYTHING!!!  Nobody could ever understand me because I can't even begin to understand myself. I hate myself.

      Emma was a very good girl today.  She finally brought my Incubus CD (A Crow Left of the Murder) to school.  She's had it for a month at the very least and I had only had it for a week before she borrowed it!  And she only watched the bonus DVD last night!  I'm listening to it right now.  Track 6 to be exact (Sick Sad Little World).  Yay!  Track 7 just came on (Pistola).  This is such a cool song.  Anyway just came online to check out  urlLink Jonathan's ,  urlLink Hazel's ,  urlLink Campbell's  and  urlLink Ramona's  blogs and thought I would post something new cos mine looked kinda neglected.  Actually Jonathan and Hazel have hardly posted anything, lazy whores!  Excuse the profanity.  PS.  You may have noticed that I've discovered how to create links, hence the linkage of almost everything!  'It's just another day in the life of apes with ego trips!'

      Last night I went to  urlLink Whitcoulls  to buy the third book in  urlLink 'Tales of the Otori'  series, 'Brilliance of the Moon'.  I haven't started reading it yet but I assume it'll be great because the first two ('Across the Nightingale Floor' and 'Grass for His Pillow') were + this is on the 'Guaranteed Great Reads' list.  While I was at Chartwell I decided to go into  urlLink Sounds  to look around and ended up buying 'Showbiz', the first album by  urlLink Muse .  I haven't decided whether I like it or not yet.  Their lastest album 'Absolution' is brilliant.  In 'Showbiz' Matt (vocals + guitar) sings just a tad too high and it sounds kinda painful.  Anyway I've gotta leave for work.  Crap I'm gonna be late!

      Today I did not go to school.  I felt sick.  Not vomity-gross-gross sick but adominal pain sick.  Went to bed and got up and about 4:00pm.  My bad!  urlLink Jonathan   came over and went on the internet.  I went to the   urlLink Givenchy   website because  Liv Tyler  has a four-year contract with them.  Now I'm downloading the  Visa  ad with  Liv  in it.  I love  Liv Tyler .

      I just did a test to find out my IQ.  Apparently my IQ is 120, which means I have an IQ which may be significantly above the population average, in other words:  I'm a f**king genius!  This is the most they would tell me about my IQ type before I have to pay $12.95, but screwed if I'm doing that:   Your Intellectual Type is Word Warrior. This means you have exceptional verbal skills. You can easily make sense of complex issues and take an unusually creative approach to solving problems. Your strengths also make you a visionary. Even without trying you're able to come up with lots of new and creative ideas.   I don't think they really describes me.  I don't feel like that kind of person.  I'll bet using words like 'exceptional verbal skills' and 'unusually creative' is to get people to pay for their own 15 page IQ report.

      I really shouldn't be doing this.  I have an English essay due on Thursday and a news article 4 media studies due on Friday.  My bad.  This is kinda entertaining though, writing crap and having it published on the net, and also kinda stupid.  It's 9:20pm and I've gotta wake up at 7:00am so I should go to bed ......... But I'm getting a kick out of this and its addictive.  Give it a few days though, the novelty will wear off.

      I just looked at a couple of other blogs, and discovered that their blogs have topics and huge paragraphs and I'm all like 'what the hell am I doing?!'.  This is really stupid cos it'll just be me ranting on about crap that is relevant to no one but me and no one will ever bother reading this.  But hey, maybe that's a good thing!.

      None of my contacts are online so I'll do something constructive. No, not homework! As if that would ever happen. I'll post something. Hee hee hee. That was unjustified. Let's discuss my last post.  On Wednesday night my mum forced me to go to a crappy careers evening at school. I was in a mood. I just rolled my eyes repeatedly while the speakers were giving their presentations. And I fidgeted. Basically I had an attitude. My mother did not approve of this. Once in the car she kept asking me what my problem was. Needless to say I was not amused. I just acted all high and mighty and went into a sarcastic mood. We yelled. And I felt like someone died. I just felt really bad and suicide crossed my mind. Only for a minute or two. But still. As I cut up carrots for my animals I kept staring at the blade and my wrists tingled. I even visualised it. I think I had some sort of emotional breakdown. I can't really remember with my whole emotional amnesia thing. All I know is that I felt like crying, as if I was grieving a loss. But I didn't. I wish I had. Maybe it would have made this whole thing easier.  Now I'm giving myself something to do. My cry for attention. You all know I'm needy. How far will it go? Have you noticed yet? You probably saw me doing it but dismissed it, or better yet, didn't even acknowledge it. How long will it be before you say something? It's funny really. Will any of you figure it out? Here's hoping. Or maybe here's hoping not. Do I know what I want? Not likely.

      I swear that I suffer from some sort of selective emotional amnesia.&nbsp; I definitely don't remember being in the state of mind to write my last post, which I guess is a good thing because I can't have been too happy.&nbsp; I guess that I always feel that way but it's buried deep inside me so I don't always realise it.&nbsp; Then I display these pseudo-feelings so that the people around me don't question me.&nbsp; I suppose is just that time of the month.&nbsp; And I'm not&nbsp;talking about PMS.&nbsp; I mean the time where I become very self-analytical and such.&nbsp; It probably has something to do with the moon.   Anyway, lets move on.   I have recently become very obsessed with Alanis Morissette.&nbsp; I listen to  Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie  almost daily.&nbsp; I just love her songs.&nbsp; I can't put into words the feelings and thoughts that they bring up.   Surrey and I went to  urlLink Leith 's house last night.&nbsp; I got wasted drinking cheap wine that smelled and looked no better than carbonated urine (it tasted like such I assume) and vodka.&nbsp; Oh and vodka and wine mixed together.&nbsp; It was&nbsp;nice.&nbsp; Not very many people turned up.&nbsp; And I was&nbsp;the only true drunk one.&nbsp; We went to this Jesse's house to watch DVDs.&nbsp; We started watching  Back to the Future , but me and Leith left, walking for about an hour and a half to get home.&nbsp; It was so cold.&nbsp; Me clutching my bottle of wine and not being able to walk in a straight line.&nbsp; I put the bottle on the ground next to a building when we got into town, meaning to pick it up again later.&nbsp; We didn't go back that way so it could possibly still be sitting there.&nbsp; Probably not though.&nbsp; So I had fun.&nbsp; It was good.

      Am I really of this world, or am I just a bystander caught up in the conflict of reality?&nbsp; Sometimes I wonder if I'm really here, and if I am, what am I supposed to be doing?&nbsp; The people around me seem to cope with living, so why can't I?&nbsp; Why must I question the decisions I make, or the the thoughts that I have?&nbsp; Why must I question my existence and the purpose of it?&nbsp; I don't want all the things the people around me want.&nbsp; But I do.&nbsp; Maybe I just don't want to want them.&nbsp; I&nbsp;don't want to take a meaningless&nbsp;job then live a life of spiritual&nbsp;unawareness and find myself forever&nbsp;questioning the&nbsp;existence of happiness.&nbsp; I&nbsp;want to tell the world my secrets so that I may be&nbsp;free of their burden.&nbsp; I want enlightenment.&nbsp; I want inner peace.&nbsp; I want to experience pure happiness, joy, elation, nirvana.&nbsp; I want to understand myself, my entire being.&nbsp; And I want to help others do the same.&nbsp; I want to live a simple life, filled with compassion, understanding, tolerance, truth and light.  &nbsp;  I want to do all these things, but until I am enlightened I shall live in this society, consuming, pretending to understand the concept of happiness and fooling myself into believing that I am experiencing it.&nbsp; And as I continue to keep everything inside, my secrets slowly driving me insane, and so called 'humanity' choking my spirit, causing it to wither and die.

      Here's a low down of my week:  &nbsp;  Monday  I was sick.&nbsp; Stayed in bed all day.  &nbsp;  Tuesday  Got up at 10:30.&nbsp; Was back in bed by 11:20 with a migraine.&nbsp; That was incredibly shitty.  &nbsp;  Wednesday  I can't actually remember.&nbsp; Probably pissed around on the net like usual.&nbsp; Actually, that's exactly what I did, wasted the whole day on the net.&nbsp; Oooh, I started reading a new web comic,  urlLink Questionable Content .&nbsp; I'll credit that discovery to Campbell&nbsp;because I found the link on his blog.&nbsp; And I went to work too.  &nbsp;  Thursday  Oooh, I actually did stuff that day.&nbsp; Went to town with Daniel.&nbsp; Returned the Nine Inch Nails CD that I got out from the library.&nbsp; Got a caramel frap from Starbucks.&nbsp; Bought a black jacket from Jay Jays.&nbsp; Put two shirts on lay by at Hallenstiens.&nbsp; God I'm a consumer whore.&nbsp; Then Daniel stayed the night.&nbsp; We had sushi for dinner at Chartwell.&nbsp; Then I ordered some Hi Top Red Chuck Taylors from Sterling Sports.&nbsp; I'm up to my face in debt right now.&nbsp; We watched  urlLink Cabin Fever  and  urlLink The Blair Witch Project .&nbsp; Cabin Fever was weird.&nbsp; Oh yeah, we watched the latest episode of  urlLink Mad TV  about five times.&nbsp; It's hilarious.  &nbsp;  Friday  I woke up at about 11:20.&nbsp; Went on the internet like usual and pissed around a bit.&nbsp; Daniel finally woke up at 1:25.&nbsp; Didn't do much really.&nbsp; Went to work.&nbsp; It was actually quite fun tonight.&nbsp; We had some laughs.&nbsp; When I got home I rang up Jonathan because he was back from Whangamata.&nbsp; He's in Raglan at the moment.&nbsp; He was going to come in tonight so I could stay over but he's working tomorrow.&nbsp; He'll come in during the day though so we can catch up.  &nbsp;  So that was my week.&nbsp; Not alot really.&nbsp; School starts again on Monday.&nbsp; Somebody just kill me now.

      Don't you just hate it when you remember something you were meant to write in your blog after you've turned off the computer, brushed your teeth, stood in front of the mirror obsessing over your hair for fifteen minutes, set your alarm for 6:55 am, turned off your light and have had your eyes closed for nearly ten minutes.  I know I do.  I was almost asleep when I suddenly thought of a much better title for my latest post.  I went into my mum's room and said 'Iforgottodosomethingonmyblogsoi'mgoingonthenetit'lltakelessthanfiveminutesiswear'.  For some reason (?) she didn't understand what I had said, but as soon as she heard the computer turn on she said 'No more than five minutes!'  About thirty seconds later she was yelling.  'Hurry up Taeghan, you're f**king me off!'  And I'm sitting there thinking 'I'm your angst-ridden teenage son.  Has it maybe crossed your mind that I don't give a shit whether I'm f**king you off or not?!'  I got to sleep at about 12:40 am.  Then I got up at 7:00 am.  I went to work and was so happy that my bitchy supervisor (Michelle) wasn't there, Lynda (who's cool) was there instead.  This happy mood lasted until I got back from my first break, when I realised that I may be coming down with the flu.  Needless to say the rest of the day was far less enjoyable.  I just sat at my checkout most of the time, staring into space, talking as little as possible and hardly ever smiling at the customers.  Anyway, I've whinged enough for one evening.  I'm just going to sit here and wait for someone to come online.  Kisses.

       urlLink Rhedyn  and  urlLink Jenny  stayed the night on Thursday.  We watched  urlLink 'Ghost World' ,  urlLink 'The Craft'  and  urlLink 'The Ring' .  That was fun.  I told Kurt that I watched 'The Ring' and he suggested I see  urlLink 'Ringu'  because he says it's much better.  I am yet to watch the other movie we got out,  urlLink 'Secretary' .  I did a whole lot of nothing today.  Apparently work rang this morning because they were short staffed, but I was asleep.  My mum told them she'd get me to ring them back.  That didn't happen.  I have five books in my amazon shopping cart:  urlLink 'Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs' ,  urlLink 'Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft' ,  urlLink 'The Complete Idiot's Guide to Wicca and Witchcraft' ,  urlLink 'Witchcraft: Theory and Practice'  and  urlLink 'The Complete Book of Incense, Oils & Brews' .  Notice a pattern there?  Now I just need a credit card.   Later:  I just watched 'Secretary'.  It was weird.  It claims to be a comedy, and although it had some comedic moments, it just wasn't.  I'm glad we decided not to watch it on Thursday night.  It has a number of scenes that would have been embarrassing to watch with two girls who have never stayed at my house before.  S+M, masturbation, full frontal nudity ... yeah.

      As you may have noticed I haven't posted in my blog for a while.  The reason:  I'm lazy and I don't feel inspired to write, even though I have been doing stuff.   urlLink Jenny  and  urlLink Rhedyn  are staying the night tonight.  We're having a movie night.  The only movie that I know that we're getting is 'The Craft'.  I love that movie.  It's hardly an accurate representation of witches but it's still really cool.  I should have a shower, do the dishes and tidy my room because Jenny said she would come over at about 3 to drop off her stuff.  She has to work until 8 and Rhedyn's coming over at 7.  I should go and start getting ready.  My room is a tip.  I promise to post again soon.

      I'm not sure what I think of this one:  Fortified melancholic foe Excruciatingly type cast Think for one, scream and deal Leave him in the past  Phantom stranger, open wound Don't bleed for me Burnt and frayed, alone again Consequence of your vulgarity  Unafraid and repetitive Sensing the illusion Pull apart, break away Anatomical confusion  The mask is gone Benediction, we are free Blessed with sordid influence Sleeping through anarchy  I wrote it because I wanted to, not because I needed to.  It didn't come out on it's own, I forced it out.

      I haven't written any of my English essay yet.  I freaked out in class and wrote another poem.  I think I'm understanding what these poems are now.  Stress relief.  I was sitting in English and everyone around me was writing and I was hardcore stressed, so I just started writing and I immediately started feeling better.  Ms Christian asked me how I was and I hesitated before saying I was fine.  As soon as I said that I felt bad because I'm sure she was genuinely worried about how I was and I lied to her.  However, if I had said I wasn't fine I'm sure I would have broken down.  I feel like crap.  Anyway, here's the poem:  Beauty repose, archaic remembrance Allude to your final sleep Death walks, shallow grave in the hollow garden Flowing dreams, anaesthetized and bloodied Melodic or elusive, no scenes narcotic Trampled and ignored, feeling Lost without sense, fall under Why?  Reality doesn't allow such thoughts Forget portentous happiness Rage, desire, locked within Escape forever, no more, no less Don't bleed, black is dead Neither red nor key-like Understand, the train passes Escape.  Forget.  Believe. Never again, cornered solidity Monotony, sequential relief, worry not Sleep child, do not weep Authenticated belligerence, sway forward Poverty of the soul, and forget all.

      Okay I'm going to try and post more often. I'm just really lazy and when I come on the net all I do is talk to people on MSN or check all my favourites. Anyway, boring crappy explanations aside.  Billie-Anne had her leaving party on Saturday. Within half an hour of being there I had already had one Export Gold and four shots of Tequila. Let's just say I got wasted. Now Billie-Anne has a photo of me posing while wearing her tight pink and black striped sweater and her frilly pink mini-skirt over my own clothes. Luckily, I refused to lie on the bed and pose like a porn star, because that would have been embarrassing (not that wearing her clothes isn't embarrassing).  On Sunday I went into work, still marginally drunk, and bought myself some hair dye. Then I went to Hazel's house and she dyed my hair. Red. Hazel dyed my hair red. So instead of having curly blonde hair I had straight red hair (I've been straightening my hair you see). I liked it. Others didn't. And when I went into work to show Amy (the girl who took advantage of my drunken state and convinced me to buy the hair dye) I was told that I may have to talk to the manager about keeping my hair that way. Needless to say I wasn't impressed. But rather then screw around with talking to people, my mum dyed over top of it with brown. Now I have curly brownish-red hair. I like it.  As you can see I am posting this when I should be at school. I haven't been at school much lately because we've been doing speeches. So now I'm on daily attendance report. Yay for me!!! Actually, the reason I'm off today is because I had trouble sleeping last night and I feel like crap. Anyway, I'm dumb and yeah. This post was almost unbearable to write because I'm finding it hard to articulate at the moment and writing things and making them sound interesting is a fucking AAARRRRGGGGHHH no I can't do it.  PS: Hazel, thank you once again for the email  Songs I've listened to while writing this post: Franz Ferdinand - The Dark of the Matinee Franz Ferdinand - Take Me Out  'Why are you so petrified of silence? Here can you handle this? ... '
