      Yes, today sucks, I am bored..really tired, I have a baseball game tonight against Six nations, which is&nbsp; a really good team, but i know the ladies and I&nbsp;can beat them! We are good, if we keep our heads in the game and cover people lol. (Although it definitly is not the Centerfielder's job to cover right and left field..I mean..they are put there to cover..geez..oh well.) I read a book yesterday, I read a book the day before and I read a book the day before that. I read two Cathy Hopkins ones and one that was by Miss Francesca Lia Block. It is one of her best books, called the Hanged Man. It made me think A LOT and I think I need to read it again. Today I am reading another England girly books. I have become attached to them. Tomorow, I shall start reading my witchcraft books, one called Summer, and the other two from the Sweep series..which are amazing books. They are about this girl who didn't know she was a blood witch, and now she is practicing Magick and everything. I love wicca, I have learned so much from it. My mom yells at me when she sees me reading stuff about it..but I don't care. I think I have to go now..i've&nbsp; been rambling on and on and on about books ect. Well Catch ya on the flipside, keep rockin' in the free world, and blessed be..(and all your wishes mote them be!) Love, Shauna

      yeah..so as of my last post on this blog...i've read two books. I finished feed, started the traveling pants book..and now i've started HP#4..which has to be done by thursday. lol  so swimming lessons started..im in the big girl level..12!! yay me..it sucks though..it's just laps and laps and then surface dives to find pennies! lol. ya..my neighbour..jeff colletti (??i dont know how to spell his last name..) is in my class. it's funny cause he has long hair..i am bored. LALALA..MASTER OF THE HOUSE..KEEPER OF THE ZOO!Yay! I went to my grandma's house/ my aunt & uncle's 25th wedding anniversary..and my sister made us listen to Les Miserables the whole way there. My family is nuts, my aunt marriane decided to have some drinks before she left her house to make sure she would get through the whole party..and she was drunk before she even got there..I swear. It was funny. My aunt and uncle are rich (her name is  Valentina  for god's sake.)..and their children are too..my aunt and my cousins all have the same platinum blonde hair..and it looks really fake and yuck..they are weird. I sat outside with two of my other aunts and my sisters..and we just sat there..we all didn't feel like going inside the resteraunt and talking to ppl we don't know..so it was fun i guess. Like i said...my family is nuts.

      Yep, today is July 8th, and I have nothing to do. I wanted to make some peanut butter cookies, but we don't have any shortening, but my father said he will pick some up later. I have nothing to do today. It's all rainy and not nice outside so I can't do anything out there..and the only things I can do in this house is go on the computer or read. I finished "How I Spent my Last Day on Earth" by that Todd guy, and it was really good. Now I am reading this book called "Feed." It is pretty cool, it is in the future, and everyone has feeds built into them, they can access any information they want and really fast and stuff. It's all about future technology and everything. They decide to go to the moon for Spring Break, and the one guy who the book is about thinks it sucks. It's a pretty cool book, but I am only on part 1 of 4..so who knows if it will be good. Kay enough about the book lol. Grrr. My father is yelling at me to get off the computer, but I have nothing else to do. I need some friends in Dorchester.

      I went to the movies and saw Supersize Me. It was cool, cause I knew McDonalds was gross, but now I know all about it, like how they only have 6 things on their menu that doesn't contain sugar, and their salads arn't one of them. Yeah well, now I figured out I will never eat at McDonalds, unless I am getting a Sundae or a McFlurry. Mmm, icecream. Well, I am going to stop this one now..I have things to do with my site..I decided I want to give it a "makeover," because I have nothing better to do. Kay bye..and until next time..love from your punkrockpromqueen!
