      Hi there tristan! Thank god you're here really.. I was starting to feel like this might not work out at all. alright, quite serendipitously, while reading your entry, I was just teaching a friend on MSN how to upload a picture. so I'll just copy and paste the instructions here:  1. go to http://www.imageshack.us/  2. upload any picture you have from your files, click "host it", and you'll taken to another page. and the very last link, I think they call it the "direct link", you have to copy it to somewhere.  3.so let's say its http://ihresidents.jpg   4.you go to blogger, in your new post, you type whatever, and then in the space where you want the picture to be, you type     and we'll all be able to check it out.

      Yo guys  Ok so i finally succeeded in joining this blog...thx to Kenny for the patience and thx to Sze Lynn for the idea, that's definitely cool.  Here's Tristan, live from Paris.  How're you guys doin'?  Life here is okay, but I'm studying like hell...I miss Sydney, where I can't remember having studied :-). actually that's not the only reason why i miss sydney...but enough nostalgia.  my masters is at the end of the road, in one month or sth. then PhD. I tried again surfing, one week in French West Coast. i suck. i should have taken more lessons in Bondi. but i will improve.  Now hot news : we met again with the Euroboys Crew&reg; last week (Jasper  aka  Jazz, Peter  aka  PP, Alexis, Christian and myself); they all came to my place and that was definitely a crazy week. as soon as I'll know how to post a pic, i will post the official group pic, taken in ... an aussie pub! (of course)  Ok, see you guys, take care, give some news, and may the Force be with you.  Tristan

      alright. I'm caving here. cheung, I'm really not bonkers enough to create what looks like THIRTY email accounts on my own. but thanks for the enthusiasm though..   so. this is another of my attempts to resuscitate what looks like my creation of a limping, sputtering wreck of a blog.   I am now offering up my username and password for you good, kind people who are currently signed up to this blog to send to people you guys think are interested enough.  there are a few options they can take with the username and password:  the first is that they can sign into this blog and post themselves repeated invitations (that's under "settings", then "members"). The main problem with this dodgy invitation service is that the link can only be used once before it brings up the error messages. just make sure to let them know that they have to sign out of this account before clicking the link in the invitation email.  the second is that they can regularly use my account to post little updates of their own until they are able to work out the signing in problems.  and if blogger continues to be a bitch, get them to email me a request to open up an account for them as, honestly, I would much happier doing this for people who actually  want  this than plugging through a huge list of anonymous addresses that may or may not materialise with takers.  its really not as complicated as it seems. we could simply email everyone this blog address (ihresidents.blogspot.com) and have them come down and have a read here.   Seriously though, it would be really nice if this worked out...  username:internationalhouse password:ihresidents

      With reference to Gary's earlier post on whether present members can sign in more members, the answer is yes.   I'm trying to log into blogger everyday and have given everyone  adminstrator  status. This means that you have the ability to do anything with this blog, from editing posts to changing the settings, as if it were your own.  The problem with signing in more members right now is that many people cannot seem to access the invitation email link or they simply ignore the email. The best apparent way right now, though rather unwieldly and inconvenient, is to set up a dummy email account, email an invitation to it, and then set up an account for the person. You then email the account username and password to him/her and have them log in and edit their preferences themselves.  Alternatively, you can also mutter "screw this" and email the addresses to me and I'll do it for you...  and then you'll owe me either a can of diet coke or a packet of chips depending on my mood. :)

      this is my final post for the day I promise... You can edit your Profile on your blogger account (include personal details, pictures, etc.) and open it up for everyone to see. We just have to click on your name under "Contributors" on the left-hand sidebar.

      I've  definitely  missed out a huge bunch of emails to crucial, crucial people. So forgive me if you don't get an email at first. Kenny will fill in the gaps. (I hope.)  -sze

      So. I was sitting in my Japanese traditional art lecture* and reflecting on the chat I had with Kenny last night. He had the laptop on and was casually checking his MSN Messenger contact list. It was huge. And they were filled with the names of people that I used to know or at least had nice recollections of hanging out with at IH. I mused on his insane popularity and realised that, as shitty an emailer as I am, I could never quite keep up the level of contact with everyone as he has. Or be as devastatingly charismatic (heh) as he is.    Therefore, I'm going to exploit Kenny. I will  make  him post here, and get him to invite all you nice-pretty people down here to post once in awhile and comment on the posts so everyone can keep in touch. And so I can stop sitting on my fat behind**, feeling sorry for myself that I will have no friends left when I finally do leave ih. I'm going to start up the first bunch of emails myself. And hopefully, most of you will eventually respond and post your updates here for everyone (though mostly me at first I suspect) to read.   Btw, this is Sze Lynn here. I am the Singaporean girl who's slightly tall, has dyed hair and mumbles incoherently. and uh, I'll send you a picture if you still have no idea, just click on the comments box below and leave your email. And if you still can't recall, for god's sake,  pretend  you do.  And if by some wonderful miracle this takes off, I'll get some techno whiz to build another page where everyone can leave their pictures and introduce themselves.   Thank you.   ( note: as of post-time, kenny has not read this yet. but he WILL cooperate. I hope. )  *the lecture is boring. my grades aren't good. **neutered for sang mi

      I'm seriously considering a trip down to Bangkok this July... could I please see a show of hands as to who will be in Bangkok during this time, and when exactly, and what they're going to do for accomodation (those who aren't living there)?  Thanks so much..   ... And oh yes, Apple, now that you're working, when will be the best time for me to come by and meet up with you?
