      *breif period of yawning* wow this is the latest ive woken up this summer, which means my body is finally re ajusting to the fact that i can sleep all dy during the summer....onto a blog:  Alright, anyone who knows me knows that im a nirvana fan. Well, there could be a few who dont. Anyway, sometimes i hang around in Nirvana yahoo chat rooms. Its fun because theres at least 5 people there with the same interests. But, theres two things i hate the most when i go into one. One is when someone comes into a room and starts mocking nirvana saying shit like "kurt was a pussy!" and "nirvana sucks", they dont have any business coming into a nirvana room and starting shit. I know, i know, ive felt the urge to go into a country room and start bashing them, but ive never done it because its their business and theyre not hurting anyone. Anyway, 2nd thing that pisses me off the most is when all people want to do is sit and talk aout "do you think kurt commited suicide or was it murder?" quite frankly i dont know. I wasnt there. I mean there are alot of signs that point suicide and alot that point homocide. There are alot of things that people say are impossible, but maybe kurt just wanted to baffle the hell out of people. LOL, he was the kind of person i could see doing this. Like one thing that people always say is impossibly is the fact that he had 3 times the fatal dose of heroin in his bloodstream, and he would have passed out in a matter of seconds. Well, what alot of people who say this dont realise that the more you do heroin, the more of an immunity you get to it, and maybe he had more than a few seconds before he passed out. The are alot of other things that im not gonna go into. After reading this you may think that i think it was suicide, well you would be wrong, because i dont know. once again i repeat, I wasnt there. Anyway, gonna wind this down with a morale for today:  "Comeone people all around, smile on your brother, eveybody get together, try to love one another right nooooooooooow"

      OK, technically its a new day, so im gonna write a new blog. Im tired, and fio wont get on, so im going to bed after this. Oh, and as for the title of this blag, i once wrote a song called "bald chia pet" it really sucked, but the title stuck with me. On to the blog:  Todays subject includes the topic is , i sat thinking 10 min about this,....and the final result was that i cant think of a topic, im too tired. So i hate to dissapoint you, but im gonna just write how im doing. Well, im tired, for starters, but as a whole im ok with how my life is currently going. There are some downsides in my life, like my room is dirty and if i dont have it cleaned by the end of the day im gonna be in deep shit. My room is very messy, and im not even sure if its possible to clean it in only on day. Its summer, so as you can imagine, im bored alot, and i wish i had some money to buy some shirts and a guitar. Anyway, besides this things, i think my life is alright, and i thank you for actually taking time to read this. It means something that your actually reading these words...thank you. Im going to bed now, but before ill prolly read a little out of "thinner" by Richard Bachman (Stephen King). alright gnight, and the morale for today is:  "Life is like a box of chocaletes....so enjoy it"

      Alright, you know im bored because this is my third blog in one day. Ill prolly write another one at midnight tonight, so yeah.I do enjoy writing these things so its whatever floats  boat. Ive got alot of negative energy, so alot of people are prolly gonna get mad at me, but these are my opinions:  Hypocrites, this is out to you. Chearleaders are PREPS, there is no way out of that. Chearleaders who listen to punk are PUNK WANNABES! punk wannabes fall into a very close category to preps. If you play sports, you are corporate. No i dont include skating a sport, bacause you dont have to compete or pay for an outfit. And it doesnt look good on a resume, so its not sucking up. Back on chearleaders. I dont care if you are "ghetto", "punk", "country" or whatever the fuck you think you are, so its still chearleading, and doesnt have my respect. Jocks can kiss my pale white ass, if you play with any kind of balls that isnt a hacky sack, you suck on my records. All of you can kiss my ass. Preps, now on your ass again. If you have dreams of going to college, getting a job, living a nice corporate life.... fuck you. If you have a dream of becoming something in music that is either acting or something entertaining, you have much of my respect. Anarchy...but i do stop and say this, people in the clothing business also have my respect, but people who have corporate jobs like....wait...ive realised....eveery job has a purpose....what have i been talking about.....FOUND ONE ...government jobs...are useless, ANARCHY, but i do realise in the state the world has come to every other fucker wants to rule the world, we must have state heads, and so on...but back onto classes of the common people. Preps are people who try to be better than everyone else, fashion, jewelry, pop music and such, are preps....Next on my hatelist, and comes in first place on my amount of hate towards...are rednecks...i hate machoist assholes who find a computer to be nonsense, free thinkers to be ...cant find a word, people who find "gay" to be bad. I dont have anything against gay people, i think that you have a right get yours off of anything you want to. I personally am not gay but, whatever floats your boat. Ghetto....people who think that they are still going under racial depression, I despise !(this goes to anyone who thinks their race is any specialer than anyone elses, this isnt just aimed at black people because more white people are like this). Punk wannabes..people who listen to punk and dont act entirely like it....fuck you. Next jocks....the males of the preps mostly. Next come the nerds and rockers, freals and hippies, gothic, whatever....more power to you....personally, lol i am grunge, i dont try to look nice whatsoever, i listen to it, i am grunge.   TO ANYONE WHO FINDS THIS OFFENDING  MY VEIWS ARE VERY CONTRADICTORY, IM A CREEP, AND PROBABLY THE WORLDS BIGGEST HYPOCRITE, THE PERSON I HATE MOST IS MYSELF, SO PLEASE BE OFFENDED...THERES NOTHING I WANT MORE.  MORALE FOR TODAY:  "you cant picture nothing, because once youve pictured it then essentially, it is something"

      Woke up at 9:40, got on and started typing, Im really tired, bored, and....my eyes are glazed. Anyway, onto a blog i guess:  Proof that music companies, especially Hip-Hop and Country, and some rock, **coughcough metallica (mainly Lars Ulrich) vs. napster coughcough** have become so corporate, they have ruined the freedom todownload free music. Corporate assholes. Just so the assholes know, even though theyll prolly never read this, they werent losing that much profit to music downloads. Most people sampled some songs and eventually bought the album, because downloading a whole album can be very frustrating, because of quality, time, and the problem that every other fuckhead has his own remix. Im sure maybe they lost some money because of music downloads, but it was a very small percent. But, hell, if people are really doing it for the joy of music, then they wont mind pirates. They should put up sites where people can download it for free.  Kitty petting, baby kissin, flower sniffin, corporate rock whores. thank you and goodnight.  moral for today: "fuck rolling stone, what do they know"

      So i stayed up til 12 o clock so i could write another message, but ill prolly write another one anyway when i wake up. Im sitting here talking to some friends and this house is hot as hells kitchen. Onto a blog:  My friends, life is not this..."short" thing they call it. No life is very long. Long enough for us to make many mistakes that we'll regret. No...im not about to fess up to anything so sit back down in your chair and put on a new pair of underwear. And yes, i was aware that what i just said rhymed. Anyway life is not short. If it were we would never claim to be bored, never claim to want to kill ourselves. Life is too long for some of us. No this isnt a suicide note either. Im just saying (and prolly repeating myself) that dont waste time trying to live it up by bungy jumping out of a plane, climbing Mt. Everest. Kick back and take it easy. Watch a movie with some friends. Whatever. Its not gonna end anytime soon...so enjoy it anyway. BUT! Im not preaching against bungy jumping or climbing mt. everest, etc., im only saying dont do it for the wrong reasons.....moral for today  "is all that we see or seem but a dream within a dream"

      Damn...do i have to bleep out my naughty words? lol...anyway this is my first blog...this stuff is contagious...one of my friends started doing this about 3 months ago...and now i have it...but onto a blog:  Its around 10 in the morning, im sitting here in my boxers and a tye die T-shirt. My neck hurts like hell and my arm feels dislocated, but i know its not cause i can move it around. The reason my neck hurts is because of a few days ago my friend, Tim, came over for only the 2nd time ever. Because his coming over is such a rarity we party like hell. He puts in a slipknot CD and we wet our hair and start head banging and jumping around and moshing (run around in circles hitting each other). Well...as much of a Kurt Cobain fan and as much as i agree with his ideals.... i like to mosh...especially in large groups. He thought moshing was bad because of how macho and primitive it is. And I hate macho people...Rednecks, jocks, hell...anyone even closely related can kiss my pale white ass. But I do like moshing because its fun, and when music has a good and heavy enough riff, its even more fun. Oh well...morale for today is:  "At least you still have your thumbs and a door on your bathroom"
