      Last Friday Q And Not U played at the Star and Garter in Manchester. In all honesty I'd hardly even listened to them for months but I loved Different Damage when I bought it and really needed a break from loud shows.  urlLink    I set off for Manchester alone and far from excited, I wasn't even going to take pictures. Well I'm not sure what happened to the original plans because I left having took over 200 photos during their set! Accompanying my newly gained photo hoard was a near-deaf left ear (' break from loud shows '?). This came courtesy of the previously innocent looking, massive black speaker, 6" to the port side of my not-so-excellent photographic stand-point, I think I was thinking "I've took bigger speakers".  urlLink    Anyway, upon leaving I hadn't the slightest regard for my hearing, in awe of the amazing show we'd all witnessed. I swear the whole way through they only played about 5 songs and then just improvised to and from them. It was totally inspiring, definately a first for me with live music.  urlLink    I was stood to the left of the stage (as if you cant tell) with no one round me due to the killer speaker and wise fellow show-goers. Here I was fortunate enough to be right in front of Chris Richards who supplied most of the singing and eccentricity. He was so ace to watch, I only wish I was half as mental (and talented).  urlLink    This daft plastic kids blowly panio instrument was probably the mainstay of the whole set. It's featured on the song 'Soft Pyramids' and super rocked.  urlLink    Why does it say "move" on his cheek? Absolutely mental.  urlLink    I think this picture's completely made by the guy screaming.  urlLink    This is my favourite, it needs to be in high res though, it doesn't look nearly as good on the website as my computer.

      OK, this is the second incarnation of a Gain website, after I lost the webspace #1 died. Using Blogger this should be a lot closer to how I wanted to start Gain anyway, i.e. there's no skatepark reviews to write. I definately think Will had the right idea with wdphotos.com.     Anyway, I've got pure loads of photographs to put up so I'm thinking posts are going to work out pretty random but at least regular. For now check this out......       urlLink

      Continuing with my indulgence into the world of copyright infringment, I just couldn't resist sharing this. I can't believe how timeless some stuff is, minus the Oakley helmet placement this would still be entirely rad today.  urlLink    Freestylin' Issue #2 1984

      I'll probably get sued for this but it'll be worth it, how else will we all learn 'The Scura Trick'? I found this in a 1985 copy of BMX Plus, which seems to have gone steadily downhill ever since. Come to think of it, how were they ever expected to beat this anyway?  urlLink    I question, have we really progressed?
