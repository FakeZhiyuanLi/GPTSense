      Have you ever met someone, not necessarily a romantic loved one, who has&nbsp;completely changed your life?   Change is something I greatly fear sometimes.&nbsp; It's my spinelessness that makes me stay in the safer route, never thinking that what may come maybe something grand.   What Tracy did to my life is that - Grand.&nbsp; When she leads me to new things, new friends, fear comes in.&nbsp; But then again, I couldn't miss something that could make my life Grand, especially if its Tracy's doing.&nbsp; Its not just fun, the humor, the "coolness" (uyyyy...) but the way she deals with life.&nbsp; I've known or seen her go through hard times and not even&nbsp;I could ever win situations that she has battled.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;not even counting those battles before I met her.&nbsp; I've learned so much from her that in a&nbsp;slow & gradual&nbsp;manner, I&nbsp;making my life Grand.&nbsp;   Pure intentions and a kind heart.&nbsp; That's how I would best describe her if you ask me something about her that's beyond her witty funny ways.&nbsp;   When Baby Girl came into the picture, my life has never been the same.&nbsp; Fun-ner, cooler in a lot of ways, smarter and as I am an emotional person, she taught me how to balance my emotional and rational side on issues and things.&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking&nbsp;to her, asking for advices has always&nbsp;given me&nbsp;a great feeling&nbsp;- like a thirsty guy clammoring for just a drop of her wisdom.&nbsp; What I like most about her is that she can be either be very deep (which makes her smart) or very shallow (here comes her humor).&nbsp; You'll learn a lot from both sides.&nbsp; She is never a bore, never a snob... always giving.&nbsp; And her presence&nbsp;or charisma&nbsp;is so sweeping, she is such a head turner.&nbsp; I love this girl so much.   I know for a fact&nbsp;that I have been a lot cooler, a lot funner and&nbsp;a lot nicer. And this is Tracy's doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Last night was so fun, full of laughters.&nbsp; And why is that? Notheng.&nbsp;   We walked around, looked for seats, sit temporarily to get some rest, then walker again, then look for seats or benches, sit, eat shomai, walk again, and then walk again, ets try some shoes so we got a chance to sit again, walk, ets teach me adi smuchies dance step, ets and adi walk a smuchies dance, went to cinemas, sit again near Wendy's, judger of people if they're virgin or not, went to starbucks for some smoking, walk again, walk, walk, cross the street under the rain, then went to overpass but check first if escalator's working, in landmark the escalator was not working, so went to another escalator, went up the overpass, ets streching her legs in a very moaning sexual way, walker again, laughter of super tiredness as of that moment, walker, walker, poor adi eats at food choices greenbelt, walker again to chums at kitchen.   So for that night, Maite and I walked ten thousand miles around glory and greenbelt and&nbsp;just the feelings and thoughts of fatigue made us laugh.&nbsp; As in loud laughters! Weird no?&nbsp; Such is our friendship.&nbsp; Weird yet Fun.

      Last night was a night of fun, a night of drinks and a night of the STARS! God... Last night was the salubong party for actor Ryan's birthday.  The party was held at the condo unit of Ryan's dad, a veteran actor, the main character of the defunct afternoon telenovela show, Valiente and the former husband of actress Gina Alajar...  Michael De Mesa.     So, who were present?  Of course, his dad, his brothers who are also actors, Jeff and AJ Eigenmann, his cousin, Gabby and the best and favorite antagonist to Sharon Cuneta.... Ms. Cherie Gil! Ooohhh...  The celebrity quality of this party was so overwhelming plus add up a couple or more strong ice, ayyyy ...wala na.   Adi was really a noisy, wierd starstruck drunkard.   Actually, kaya ng chums ah.  When Ireshli arrived, Deesj was in the washroom.  So unlike us who were introduced as a group, she had to be especially introduced to Ireshli, all by herself.  So, KAYA NI DEESJ HA!  Twelve midnight, it was time for Ryan to blow the candle. So, greeter here and there.  And then suddenly, Mike (well, that's how they call Michael De Mesa) shows up with a tennis racket as a gift for his son.  Of course, Adi cannot stand this kind of father-son scenarios.  It was a touching moment, and it really took a great effort to shove my emotions especially that i was under the influence of alcohol.   Anyway, as the beer buzz was taking its toll on me, I began to act weird again.  I felt that its not everyday that you get to party with celebrities.  So, I exerted effort to have a picture taken with each of the celebrities present.  You can say I was starstruck.  But, actually, nag hahave fun na rin ako hopping from one actor to another, even to Leoy, who at that time, I felt was part of the movie star family because of his Boysen TVC.  I can't wait to get those pictures, especially the ones with Cherry Gil and Michael De Mesa.  I plan to put them in my friendster (which I haven't visited for a decade) to add them with my photo with Ate Shawie.  Later into the night, adi, deesj and leoy, seem to get into another mood.  I don't know how it started but it became some sort of serious talks about my issues with my dad.  And, actually, serious & very long talaga.  As if we're not there to party.  Me, I was explaining how my father-son issues began. Deesj and Leoy, on the other hand, seem to act like my big bro and sis, giving me advices on how to deal with it - its a been-there-done-that type of thing for them.   So, there.  Over-all, it was a WEIRD but fun night for the chums.  A starry starry night...  Note 1: I had a heart-to-heart talk with shiva about her ill feelings towards pairing of Jeff and Heart.  Note 2: I texted Ryan when I got home to thank him for the great party. (Diba?!!! Text?) Note 3: Lastly, i didn't want to attend the party becuase of works the next day, and others said, one hour lang sila and joel naman said he's sick.  For me lang, SHAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      I hate my computer.&nbsp; Its the slowest thing on earth.&nbsp; God, it took me eight thousand sixty two years just to open&nbsp;my Windows.&nbsp; Plus, when i opened my email, it won't show&nbsp; my inbox.&nbsp; What's the sense then? Notheeeng.&nbsp; And then, my Chicane wallpaper was replaced by blank stupid green wallpaper.&nbsp; And suddendly, all fonts are so gigantic, even the icons.&nbsp;&nbsp;Worst.&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; But because&nbsp;I'm such an annoying&nbsp;complainer (similar to how I am with putik),&nbsp;I&nbsp;quickly protested to our admin this utter human degradation&nbsp;(as aby would put it)&nbsp;I am enduring.&nbsp; I couldn't check my&nbsp;email, couldn't chat&nbsp;in ym (although, I can't say this bec its not&nbsp;allowed in our office), couldn't art direct in photo shop (shar!) and most of all couldn't&nbsp;write in my blogger!&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, thank&nbsp;God, they're replacing my computer.&nbsp; Hence, this blog.&nbsp; Bye. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      My high school friend, Mitzi, is leaving tom for the states. She will try her luck there. So, pretty much, it might take forever before I can see her again. Sad, but I'm happy for her - actually, I quite envy her for a taking a step that's quite risky. It sure is a confident move. (Plus, the fact that this country is going to the dogs!) Sad, because I'm left again - more and more of my friends are leaving this very beautiful and rich country. But I'm used to this already because a lot of special people have come and go. And I know there will come a time when we have to say our goodbyes to each other - its inevitable. Unless you find a partner who will grow old with you, you're bound to be alone. Yes, they will be there for you, they say. But let's get realistic here... not at all times (maybe in prayers, their thoughts...sucks). The fact is, they will leave you. Or they may not be so far away but they will have new priorities in life by then.  I didn't intend this blogger to end up like this. Really. The mushy-ness of this makes me cringe. So, i'll leave na while I can control my inner feelings. To my friend, Mitzi, good luck and hope you'll earn big big bucks so you can treat me to Disney Land!

      Being an AE, believe it or not, is very fulfilling for me.  I may not write copies or draw stuff, but to orchestrate everything is such a big responsiblity that I think even Creatives would have a hard time doing... Except TODAY!!!  ...and LAST WEEK!!!  Hate this job.  I don't know if my brain can stand piles and piles of work.  I don't even know where to start, which makes it hard for me to finish.  I wanted to cut my body parts and distribute it to different tasks that lay ahead just so I can finish one thing.  But no.... I have to do everything at the same time.  How the fuck should you expect me to be efficient?  Yun lang.  Just needed to get this out. Bye.

      I was a driver kanina.  My sister had to watch this UAAP game because the company she's working for is a major sponsor.  Since I heard today is Good Samaritan day (yeah, now lang din ako nakarinig of such thing), I offered to drive for her.  I brought her to araneta and I then proceeded to meet my high school friend at greenhills.  Since walang magawa, napabili tuloy ako ng fake puma sneakers. God. Expenses.  But its okay, liked the shoes.  Tapos, when I got back to araneta, the game's not done yet.  so i bought the cheapest ticket and went in.  Last three minutes. We were leading by six points.  But for some reason, we lost. fuck. I know, I know I've passed that stage, i'm not a student anymore and all that, but when you're in there, emotions get high. And plus the fact that I hate losing to Ateneo.  Them fuckers.  So yun, we lost.  I dont know lang kung tom, may pake pa ako ha.

      Year 2001.  Was the year I met tracy.  We used to work in the same company.  July of Year 2001. Tracy's birthday - Survivor Game. First time I met chums (Tracy brought me to the wonderful world of chums).  My first impressions of chums - class (w/ the tisay, english speaking dsj), smart and funny.  July of Year 2001. Party at Robinsons. This sealed my friendship with the chums.  August to Present.  Hanging out with chums.  Why bucket of sunshine?    I really don't know.  The thing is, Chums is a really really funny and whacky group.  As a person, I laugh at the corniest jokes. Sometimes even a word like "cloud" uttered by Tracy makes me fall on the floor and laugh my lungs out.  Also as a person, I have the loudest laugh in the world.  So you can just imagine how i rocked chum's world, in a laughter way.  In the same way they, the chums, rocked my world.  Most of my happiest and funny moments are moments spent with the chums.  That's why for me, if I'm their bucket of sunshine, they're my ummm... (okay, here starts my difficulty in writing, trying to find the best desciptive phrase..God!), how about... Laughter in the Rain?  Oh, damn it. Never.  You know, they're my giver of joy, for the lack of better creative phrase...   So in summary, I guess the chums called me that because I seem to laugh at anything and everything.  But little do they know... It is I who consider them my life's biggest bucket of sunshine.

      Maite has told me about this website, where you write whatever you want to write. She asked me to make one.  Took me a long time because I had apprehensions. I'm not really a writer.  Most of my friends are (and not just plain writers, but damn good ones) and they're quite judgers of things.    But I've come to realize that my chums are chums.  Judgers they may be, I love them.  And I'm sure they love me back.  So, dont ker much if my writing sucks.  Important thing is, I think I'll have fun writing whatever thoughts I would have.  So, guys, welcome to my world.

      I miss Gigi. I miss her "tanda" hirits. I miss her loud laughters. I miss her "kamot-sa-batok" actions when pissed. I miss her food. I miss her.  I miss everything about her.  Hay, can't wait for pasalubong.

      I went home late last Sunday night. I got home at about 2 pm. But who the hell goes out on a Sunday? Only the chums. To think, I have to be in Taytay Rizal at 7:30 Monday morning. Maybe my body's saying..."I'm not superman no! Sana take care of me."  Anyway, I slept at about 230 am after some minor cleaning up and brushing of teeth. Immediately after, I jumped into my bed and went into a deep slumber. Sleep, sleep, sleep..zzzz...  then my cell phone alarm goes off. It's 430 am already. That fast. Its the hardest thing... to rise up and still feeling groggy from the alcohol intake. But what choice do I have? Nothing. And what's worse, there's no fucking electricity! Since we're poor, we don't have naman a generator. So I had to find my way to Linda, our house help. I asked her to make kulo some water (heater in our shower wouldn't work becuase of brownout) because I cannot really stand cold water especially that early.  So there, I took a bath, dressed up and my dad took me to the taxihan, then to the office, then to Panasonic at Taytay Rizal.  I wasn't really in the mood. I wasn't exactly the perky guy at that time, so I was hoping nothing would piss me off.  After we arrived, I saw my Client and a whole bunch of employees dressed in kimonos with a headband tied around their foreheads. Di ka ba mairita nun?! God.  Oh well, good thing they fed us good food. As soon as we got back to our office, I ate lunch and right after looked for a lungga where I can sleep. From one to three thirty pm, I was sleeping there. And all the while, everyone was looking for me. Delinquent.  Crap. Well, that's it. Bye.

      I was with my closest cousin, Earl last night.  He's younger than me but he looks like a father na.. well, he is a dad na pala.  I missed the those times when we were young. We had so much fun.  We went everywhere, did everything. But as we grew older and new priorities sprung up, we slowly drifted away from each other.  The last time I saw him since last night was like last year pa.  And now that's he's a dad, he just didn't mature mentally but also physically.  He has the biggest stomach in the world.   Before, we used to drink almost every night after work.  Maybe that's the cause of his big tummy.  Hay... wished I was young again.  Gone are those days when we just go around, looking for things to do and sometimes make a fool of ourselves.  Anyway, he talks and thinks like a mature person now.  He even has his own business - a palaisdaan of sorts.  Very responsible.  Way to go, cuz. Good luck and see you soon.

      I needed a talent for a photo shoot for Suzuki. Client is really a cheapler. So definitely, trying out talent agencies is out of the question.  Good thing I have a friend who's a "professional" commercial model (ooohhh...) who I can really count on - and that's LEOY. So I called him if he would be interested.  He'll just pose beside a Suzuki motorcycle clad in motorcycle gear/suit (don't know how you call it) while holding a helmet. Cool, huh.. Very Leoy. Anyway, initially it was for brochure use only, so Leoy accepted the first talent fee of P5,000. And then my Client said he'll be used also for posters and if possible, to retain the five thou fee. Of course, knowing Joel, I'm sure he'll object. And he did. He wanted an additional of P3,000. We negotiated and we agreed for an additional of P2,000 for a total talent fee of P7,000.  All's set then. Tomorrow's the shoot at 9 am.  Then, at about six pm, client called asking for Joel's height. Six Feet. That's the kicker. Hindi kasya ang costume sa kanya.  So there you go. A chance for stardom, limelight and fame... all went down the drain.  P.S. As my boss was leaving, she passed by my desk and told me to tell Joel that she'll sure get him for the next projects, not just Suzuki. O diba Leoy... I think she fell for you. Woohoo...

      It just sunk into me now that one of my friends left. Aby left for Singapore to work as a copywriter in an ad agency. She's bound for success and I'm so proud of her.  I remember very clearly how our paths first crossed. One time, not so long ago, in an old classroom in La Salle, my classmates and I were waiting for our teacher for copywriting. And, after some chattings, in came Aby or "Miss", as what students usually call their professors. But the minute she came in, I know this class is going to be different. Already, she gave me an impression that she'll definitely make the class fun and interesting, something that what most students want - NOT BORING. I know the class was fun because she really was a good prof, very funny and you'll surely not get bored. I remember she often used the word "tsienes" in between her lectures and really at that time, it was really really funny for me. A prof saying "tsienes, tsienes" in her lecture? That's gotta be funny. I don't know if she remembers, but in one of our group activities, I even sang "baduy masa OPM" songs just to make a point in our group presentation. Fun. Fun. Fun. (We even smoked with her outside the classroom. When you're a student, it makes you feel cool.)  Anyway, at the end of our semester, I thought that was the last time I would see "Miss." But a couple of years after, our paths crossed again. I worked at Image Dimensions and there I met tracy, who then introduced me to the "chums." "Miss" was part of that group - the Chums. So, at first, it was kind of awkward to be hanging out with Aby because in the first place how should I call her - Miss? - as what I'm used to or Aby? as how chums would call her. Chums would always dare me to call her by her first name but as I've mentioned, it was hard. But then, as time progressed, we've hang out often enough to treat each other as friends, not just a teacher-student thing. From then on, I learned to call her by her name. Sweet.  All I want for her is to succeed in whatever she wants to do because she's definitely a talented one. Go Miss, er, Aby, Break a Leg!  See yah in six months...

      I was telling Maite the other day that some things happen that you never could have imagined it would.   This was the premise of my thoughts…   It was during Tracy’s “Survivor” birthday party that I first met Corinne De San Jose, most commonly known as Deesj.  I found her pretty then, a tisay in fact.  It was pretty hard for me to “connect” with her because we all know that she is not that “approachable” to new people.  But that is not to say that she’s not nice at all.  Even she would say, “anong gagawin ko, i-hug ko lahat ng papakilala sa akin?”  Another thing is… I was quite intimidated by her frequent use of the English language in normal conversations.  Plus, in that party, she voted me out!   Anyway, what I’m trying to say here is that given the background story, I never imagined that three years after the first time we met, she would be my flatmate.   And I’m glad.

      I had a drinking spree with my best bud.  Drunk, he broke the news that he's leaving for the States. God! Not Again!  I'm left again.  I've known this guy for quite a relatively short time as compared to my chums and other friends, just last year, but he made such a big impact in my life. The bond we shared was different, seemed like we've known each other for so long.  There are a lot of times that we hang out, just the two of us. And we never ran out of things to say, stories to tell. That's what I like about this friendship. Never a dull moment.  And yeah, this friendship has been through a lot. From the most depressing moments, to fights, tampos, out of town trips, issues and lots of issues, and of course, those ecstatic unforgettable moments that if mentioned, i would end up in jail.  Anyway.  This is something he needed.  He is quite depressed here so who am I to deny him of that.  If leaving would make him happy, then by all means, go.   As for me, again, that's one lesson in life that I have already learned and mastered, coping up with friends leaving.  Hope you do well in school there bud.
