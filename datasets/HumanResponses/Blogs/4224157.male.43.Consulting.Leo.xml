      Dear Uncle Red:   My company has just been bought by a bigger corporation.  I like my job but I suspect they’re just going to clean house. How can I make sure I keep my job through the transition?   Kyle   Dear Kyle  I think it was the great philosopher BlackBeard who said, “Them what died right away were the lucky ones”. But if you insist on being the corporate equivalent of Richard Hatch, Here’s some advice.  First of all, you’re in good company. According to the Commerce Department, over 150,000 companies are bought, sold, merged or otherwise become part of a corporate anschluss each year. (Look it up under World War 2 History- the greed-heads at Time Warner put up less of a fight than Austria did). That leaves a lot of people each year whose jobs simply go away for reasons that have nothing to do with their competence, dedication or talent. That should be a great comfort as you fill out the fields on Monster.com in your Sponge Bob Square Pants slippers and tattered robe.  If though, you are really determined to get through it, here are some things you should know:  First the good news- you're in IT. For once this works to your advantage, since during the due diligence process no one ever figures out how much of a nightmare it's going to be making your systems talk to the new mother ship. They'll eat up 6 months profit just trying to figure out how you managed to rout your email through Guam (which I'm sure seemed like a good idea to one of you geeks but no one can remember who).  It’s better to be the changer than the changed. By becoming part of the transition team you’ll be seen as a team player by the new management, which, warm and fuzzy promises aside, is destined to be the ONLY management by the time they’re done. More importantly, you’ll meet the important players and be more than a name on a list. They’re less likely to fire you if they know and like you. Just know it’s not going to make you the most popular kid in class.  Like Marvin Gaye said, believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see. It’s important to know what’s going on but don’t fall into the gossip trap. Change management experts identify destructive gossip as the most damaging behavior to smooth integration- and spreading it is the quickest path to unemployment.  Be prepared for the stress of staying to be as bad or worse than the stress of leaving. Survivor guilt is only the most obvious challenge. Doing the work of those who’ve left because you’re the only one who knows the location of the supply closet is no picnic either.  If none of this helps, think about this- the hardest part of surviving a buyout may be hearing from those who leave about their great new jobs and how leaving was the best thing that ever happened to them. As the survivor of four buyouts in the last seven years I can testify to that one. The lucky @#%s never shut up.  Uncle Red

      Uncle Red:   I’m about to give my first presentation to the board of my company. People keep telling me that content accounts for less than 10% of the impact. Doesn’t what I know count for anything? Tiffany   Dear Tiffany…  What you’ve heard is the most overused and badly quoted statistic in business… other than success is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration which is not only untrue, it's highly unsanitary and puts a lie to the idea of the "sweet smell of success". But I digress....  The old wisdom goes like this:  During any presentation, the audience is impacted 60% by what they see, 33% by what they hear and only 7 % by the content of the presentation. Sound familiar?  Presentations skills training is a market worth a little under $200 Million a year, much of it based on those numbers.  They come from a study conducted at UCLA back in 1969 by Albert Mehrabian. The numbers are correct as far as they go, but here’s the dirty little secret: the people studied were people who knew each other intimately like family members. The numbers were never scientifically applied to presentations to total strangers. There is no scientific relevance to business presentations.  But it  sounds  true, which is good enough for most people. We Americans don't need to be convinced, we just need whatever we hear not to sound so ridiculous that we can't choke it down with a little bottled water (at $2 a bottle despite the fact that most of the drinking water in America is perfectly safe but we've  heard  that tap water can contain...well you get the point). You're in marketing, for Corn's sake, your future rests on the truth of that premise.  Fact is, content does count- a lot. When a solid message is presented by someone who looks and sounds credible the audience accepts and retains it (at least enough of it to count) and all’s right with the world. The problem is where there is a  disconnect  between the message and the non-verbal signals you’re sending.  Back in ancient Greece, Demosthenes proved anyone could train themselves to be better speakers, and the better they were, the more they were respected. Nothing's changed except that togas are no longer acceptable on casual dress Fridays mostly (because of the open toed sandals) and sleeping with young boys is against HR policy in most companies, at least while they're interns.  It's still true though. No one is going to give you a bump in your budget if they are secretly worried you’ll spend it on crystal meth.  Your brother Kyle would have a whole lot easier time getting funding for the IT department if he looked more like the finance people and didn't think making smart-aleck remarks in Klingon constituted wit, but the communication challenges of the IT folk are beyond my humble efforts to remedy.  How people perceive you can permanently impact your career.  Harvard Business Review  every couple of years releases a survey of managers who asked for the number one skill set in their employees. Communication skills ranked number one, ahead of technical skills and remembering to turn the coffee pot off before you leave the office.  Need proof? Throw your memory back to third grade. You and three other kids are doing a dinosaur diorama and presenting it for show and tell. Who gets the strokes- the kid who stayed up all night gluing diplodochus to the cardboard or the kid who did nothing but stand up and present it?  Take it from your Uncle Red, Tiff, business ain’t that different from third grade except the cafeteria is better and they serve coffee.  Love, Uncle Red

      Dear Tiffany,  Thanks for your email thanking me for the graduation present. Truth is, what I'd really like to do is pay for another semester of college to delay your entering the real world but THAT ain't happening. Instead I hope it fits 'cause the receipt has found its way into my expenses file for tax purposes. Congratulations, you're officially considered "Miscellaneous Publicity Expenses". Please tell someone about my company or I'm going to jail.  Anyway, you asked for some advice to make you wildly successful in business. I'll try.  I don't know what to say except to walk up to your parents, smile and strike them with an open palm on the back of your head for naming you Tiffany.  It's a fine name if you're a stained glass window, not so good if you want to be taken seriously in business.  CEOs are not named Tiffany, nor are they Kyle nor Brittany. They're named Shirley, or Tom or Bill. In San Jose they're frequently called Ahmet or Ranjit or Inderjit, but they are the Hindi equivalent of Shirley, or Tom or Bill. There is no known Sanskrit equivalent to Tiffany and for very good reason.  That's probably not really helpful in the long run, so let me see if I can pull a pearl out of my uhhhh hat.  After all, your long term success is my success- or at least means I'll be able to visit your parents in a much nicer nursing home years from now.  As the great Marcus Aurelius says, "Be satisfied with success in even the smallest matter, and think that even such a result is no trifle."  This does not mean be satisfied with mediocrity in yourself- it means take your victories when you can get them and realize you'll lose more than you win. That doesn't need to be pessimistic. Think about it- if you're a baseball player getting one hit out of three for your career will put you in the Hall of Fame.  Not only will setting the bar sufficiently low help keep you sane , it will make it easy to get "surpasses expectations" on your performance review, which is the secret to career elevation in any corporation and the key to the executive bathroom.  I have to go now, there's a meeting in 5 minutes and I have to add 10 more PowerPoint slides to my presentation to make sure no one understands that our sales suck like Paris Hilton on a second date.  Uncle Red
