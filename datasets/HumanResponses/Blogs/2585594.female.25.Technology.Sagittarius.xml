      Some girl whose first name was Chelsea Camille had this to say about herself:  i love life, with all its euphoric highs and despite all its frustrating lows.i love my dysfunctional family, am a big daddy's girl and proud of it. i cherish my friends and will do just about anything for them. i have found myself with an overwhelming book collection comprised of fiction, non-fiction, and biograhies from all over the world! the desire to travel is in my veins and i will go pathetically broke and do absolutely anything to see the rest of the world and live in Paris at some point in my lifetime. i have visited 47 of the 50 us states and plan to finish off the last three within the next five years. new york is overrated, in much the same way as colorado is underrated. i love Impressionist art and am currently trying to master this style. if i could pick a spot in the world that i could make mine, i'd defintely choose the Musee d'Orsay in Paris. i could get stuck in there for hours. oh and i'm from vietnamese, spanish and filipino descent.   At first, I was like, 'whoa!'. She's been places and done things that I could only dream of. Well, not because I can't ever do them, but because I just don't have all that time and moolah.  And so I sit, and think. And then I look at what her friends say about her. One person's description gives me the impression that she's a party girl. Two others describe her as a 'really cool, fun girl to be with', using words 'high' and 'rollercoaster ride' and 'fantasies' in there. These are both men. And then I come across someone saying that they were actually 'together' way back in high school. And this last one was a girl. Hmm...  Okay, okay. Calm down.  One, she's been places and done things. Two, she's a wild child. Three, she has 200+ friends in there... Hmm.. Makes me wonder.  Someone lost something through that process. She might have gained all those friends and seen and read all these things, but do they really define her? Is that who she really is?   For example, is she really a traveller or does she travel because she wants to be able to call herself one? Did the label come after the experience, or the experience come after the label was idolized and idealized?  I mean, everyone wants to do things and be things. Did she do first, and become second...or did she become first (i.e. tried the label on for size in her head) and then do.  And I tell you, there is a difference. A very big difference. For people who have the time, energy, and resources, it defines the difference between being a real world-traveller and being a social traveller. It defines the difference between being a name-dropper and actually knowing people and appreciating them for what you have come to know them to be and mean.  And in the end, maybe it's just a little too much pizzazz for me. I mean, something's gotta give, right? She can't just have everything, right? Come on, agree. You know something's not right here, right?  And these are just too many run-on sentences that do not fit together in one small piece.  And, then again, you might turn around and say that I am just a jealous, spiteful, uneducated fool. And maybe you're right. But this is my site, and I WILL write whatever it is I feel like writing. So claw me. :-P

      You wept where my soul lay, And I, ignorant in the rapture of bliss in revenge, I kept silent Did not. Could not. Fathom why.  You wept where my path crossed yours, And I, ignorant in the delight of joy in punishment, I kept silent. Did not. Could not  Fathom why.  You wept where my eyes gazed, And I, ignorant in the facade of pretense in joy, I kept silent. Did not. Could not. Fathom why.  You wept where my words reached your ears, And I, ignorant in the excitement of thrill in the future, I kept silent. Did not. Could not. Fathom why.  You wept, and I doubled up in gaiety. For while you saw me, I saw you. I saw you.  You see? I kept silent Because you could not. I kept silent  Because you would not. I kept silent. Because you did not fathom why.

      Heidi had finally done it. She had broken up with Cody. It was not easy, though. Cody, being the asshole that he was, thought that he could change her mind by feeling her up. Heidi was tired of the same old thing. Cody was an intelligent man, good in bed, and lavish with his gifts. But he just did not know how to treat Heidi the way she should have been treated. They were together for almost a year, and Heidi still felt insecure every time some Cody commented on some woman's nice legs or ass or boobs.  Heidi wasn't normally like this. She was normally an open-minded non-jealous girlfriend. But with Cody, things were different. And today, Heidi realized why. And a complete stranger helped her.  She was having lunch, as usual, in a restaurant in front of her office building when the waiter suddenly complimented her on her dress. His exact words were 'That dress becomes you.' He had a warm smile, and so Heidi smiled back. And then she thought about Cody. Did he notice that she wore a nice red dress today, with her nails painted the same color, and her sandals showing off her slender, manicured feet. He did not. And then she tried tot hink back to the last time Cody complimented her. And the only time she could remember was when she was wearing a pair of black underwear that he had given her. She thought back some more because she could not believe it was the only time he actually complimented her on something. She could think of nothing else. And then she knew why she was feeling depressed.  Cody did not appreciate her physically. Of course he made love to her. What man would not like some lovin' from his woman? But he never made her feel that she was special to him. In fact, now that she thought about it, he rarely complimented her about her work or her personality either.  And then she knew. All the time that she fooled herself into believing that he was just not the 'complimenting kind' or the 'caring kind', he really didn't see her as special in his life.  And so she broke it off.  Heidi smiled as she walked the five blocks to her home.

      NOTE: JOURNAL-LIKE ENTRY WARNING: IF WE'RE NOT FRIENDS, it doesn't make sense for you to read on.  FYI to all. On January 2, I got myself a popup saying I won accomodations/tickets to 5 destinations in the US. I called them and confirmed. I now have my confirmation number. I just have to call them and reserve 3 months in advance. Me and some officemates are planning to go one weekend in April.   WIll let you know if it's bogus or not. If it turns out to be for real, then woe to those who thought it was just another internet scam to get ads into our line of vision. If not, then woe is me.   I'm getting coffee.

      Ken's been anxious the past couple of days. We've been talking every night for the past 5 days because he's worried about his future --- his social future, anyways. See, Ken lives in California today. And his girlfriend lives 5 houses away from him (Note: They're also both half-Filipino).  But Ken is going to NYC this spring. And he's worried about what will happen to him and Sarah when he leaves. Sarah is still thinking about whether she wants to go on to college or not. Ken thinks Sarah is too good for him. He says she's nice and sweet and friendly, and pretty, and sexy, and intelligent. 'Right,' I said. Every boyfriend's description of his girfriend. Typical, I thought.  He then sent me a picture of them together. And she was not just pretty. She was HOT!  I also got a chance to talk to her, and I've gotta say that she is pretty talkative and animated. But the whole 5 minutes we talked, all she could think about was the weather, and clothes, and Britney Spears, and the new wave of Avon products.  Typical.  But see, Ken is not typical. Ken's going to NYC on a scholarship. Ken's a geek with a great smile. That's what I always teased him as, anyways. He was extremely intelligent, and had views that showed he was wise for his age. He knew how to party. But he also knew how to work hard. He was a cool guy who played basketball with his friends and joked around with them. But he also knew how to treat girls right. Ken was the ultimate heart throb who had girls falling for him left and right, who ended up being the Class Clown, Student Council President, and Prom King during his senior year.  But he picked Sarah. And he described her as all those things I mentioned above.  (Fine. Never mind my two-cents' worth that she doesn't seem to be all that.)  Ken was in love.  And now, he's worried that she'll find someone else when he's not around.  What about the possibility of Sarah going with him and working in NY while he studied there?  He had asked her that. And Sarah had said, 'Oh that's sweet, baby, but if I'm going to live with you, I want everything to be laid out. I don't want to work. It would kill my social life. Our life.'   WTF!  I asked Ken what he thought about this. He said he didn't want to force her. But he didn't want to lose her either.  Go Figure!  So to Ken, and to all the other Kens out there (please at least be smart enough to know that you're a Ken), go bash your head against the wall. Or try walking around blindfolded. You just might see what you're missing by being infatuated with sexy bods and gorgeous faces attached to air heads (pun intended).  And to Sarah....'Go watch MTV. Britney's on, dahlin'.  (sigh)  (shrug)  (moving along)

      I am at a cafe with my new Amboy/Amgirl acquaintances, and some americans(black and white, yes), as well as some Europeans who have migrated to the US. We are a culturally diverse group of eight. And because I am the newest member in this makeshift Coffee Club, the focus is on the Filipinos today.  One AmGirl started talking about Filipino pride.   Apparently, Pinoys here in the US have enough of this stacked up in their system to last them 5 lifetimes. That's what she said. These Amgirls and Amboys have been here more than five years (indeed, others --- more than 10), and they all say that one of the few things they kept with them is the Filipino Pride. I asked them what that meant and one AmBoy basically said it was the equivalent of 'Proud to be Filipino' thinking. More commonly, though, this would be identified in any culture as just plain pride. They just went on and on about Filipinos sticking together and keeping their values and their Filipino ways even after adapting to the cultural ways in the US. I did not say a word. It was pretty interesting to know this stuff. From Amboys and AmGirls in their twenties and thirties. I was born and raised (and educated) in the Philippines, and I never (na-uh, not even once) heard of the concept of Filipino Pride. I started to think maybe I fell asleep in one of my Filipino or History Classes and so I missed out.  However, five minutes after that topic was over, the europeans-slash-americans moved into a new topic and start talking about upcoming elections in their former country of citizenship. And the AmPeople (if anyone dare ask, I'm defending myself via poetic license) start dishing out the dirt on the upcoming elections in the Philippines (which, by the way, they ghetto-ishly refer to as P.I.), with FPJ being the star of that line of conversation. And the Americans stand in awe and all they can say is 'That's fucked up,' and one European goes 'Whoa, that's messed up.'   I try to put in my two cents worth as I feel as though I am being attacked. And I say 'But you know, it's not all that bad,' and I go into this whole thing about corruption being present in most countries in the world. And politicking being the center stage of governments -- both first and third-world. And just as two Americans nod their heads in seeming agreement, this AmGirl suddenly butts in and says 'Yeah, but the corruption in the P.I. government is the worst.'  Pardon my agitation, but I just wanted to sock her in the face right there and then. I contained myself, of course (of course. The normal middle-class pinoy is non-confrontational, studies showed). But I felt that that comment was so blatantly stupid, I just wanted to tell her to go back home and eat some more hotdogs and paint her face, and maybe she could pass for a human being with average intellect.  I mean....Hello-uw! (say that with the right tone, and I swear to you, you'll sound like that girl in Clueless). What was wrong with that picture?   I don't even wanna get into it because it's getting me so damn mad just thinking about it. But let me just say this.   If other people's views of Filipinos and of the Philippines are at an all-time low, it's either because no one bothered to give them an explanation, or because Filipinos themselves gave them that wrong impression.  (2 secs for you to think about this)  'Nough said by a person who has never (until the verbal exchange happened, as was just narrated) heard of the term 'Filipino Pride' described, defended and assaulted within 5 breaths of each other.  Note: This is one of those 'Did it really happen or was it all in my head?' stories. Go figure.

      I just wanted it down for my records. I felt shitty for a while. Trembling vigorously all over when I spoke to him the last few times over the phone. And when I finally did let go, it was a resignation. It wasn’t actually a decision I had to make. He didn’t want in, and so I felt that he might’ve been better out of it. Maybe I was wrong, I don’t know. Maybe I shouldn’t have put that out there. But this is not the time to think about that.  It’s mostly over now, I think. I’m just hurt because it happened so quickly. I didn’t have a clue that it had gotten that bad for him. I mean, maybe I did, but I chose to ignore it. Or maybe, I did, but I didn’t recognize it. Either way, this still isn’t the time to write about it.  It’s gonna be a long time before I totally get over it, I know. I’m admitting it to myself. The fact that I could not allow myself to be mad at him is a sign that this one was quite different from the others before him. And I did not automatically shield myself from the hurt. I am allowing myself to think about it, immediately after it happened, which is so unlike me, as people who know me will end up saying ‘oo nga no’ to. But it’s there. And I’m hurt. And I’m lost and sad and down and up at different times of the day. A flurry of emotions all coming out of one culminating event. The end, it’s supposed to say. But I keep saying no. Still  sitting down on my movie seat and waiting for something else to happen, to give me an understanding of the behind-the-scenes of it all. Well, I will know soon enough, won’t I?   Anyway, music and sights determine my each thought and each tumble and turn of emotion. I’m just going with it. This is kinda new for a hard-outer-shelled woman like me. And I’m kinda fascinated by it all.  The only part I think that sucks for my pride is him going out with that other girl. But I’ll get over that as well. I know that he knows that she’s nothing like me. His reasons for choosing her over me are his reasons. But I know that in the end, I’ll know that he lost out. Like I lost out. Maybe we’ll both lose out. Maybe we won’t. But that’s how life goes.  And I can’t even go out and find someone to play with, as easy as that is, and that realization is also every bit as fascinating as the first one. I think he didn't leave as big a hole in my life as the previous ones did. There is one, though, don’t get me wrong. But it’s not an all-encompassing hole. It just hurts every now and then, makes me breathe in a little deeper and take things in slower, letting it heal. I just might, someday, thank him for that. For not letting me lose my identity completely. Thinking about it makes me miss him a little bit more. The thought that no one else will ever touch my life the way that he did.   Right now, I’m just hoping I’ll find the happiness I deserve. Someday. One day. Also, I just want to be able to talk to him and find out what exactly happened. I think he owes me that much. But if I tell him that, I know he could come back and tell me that he owes me nothing.  Hmmm. He can be really hurtful. And he’s barely sweet. And yet I loved him. Says something about me, don’t you think?  Those who know me think I’m brave and strong. I didn’t think so. I thought that deep down I was a scared little child. I guess, now I realize that I’m a bit more mature than I REALLY gave myself credit for.  And even though I do end up telling him I learned nothing from what happened with us, I will come away with a difference in me. Steady. Easy. Riding life like riding a horse in the wild. Just observing the surroundings. Taking in the world. Looking hard to find my passion, but not really digging too deep. Steady. I love that word. I loved that man. And my still-fresh scars I think speak for themselves.   I’m having lunch now.

      Call her Heidi.  Heidi is a 27-year old Filipina who migrated to the United States when she was 16. Doing the math on that, she's been in the US for 11 years this year. Looking at her, it seems possible. Listening to her, however, is a different matter altogether. See, Heidi speaks english like most Filipinos do. Her diction and her expressions shows she's been here long enough. But her grammar and sentence construction say otherwise. She says things like 'Did they won?' and 'I've gone already' which would irk some grammar-compulsive people. But she's a normal Filipina beauty --- big, black eyes, sensuous lips, and that nice kayumanggi color that's in between the brown of blacks and the cream color or whites --- with the sweetness that's characteristic of Filipinos, and it seems like that more than makes up for her lack in grammatical correctness.  Heidi's been working as a secretary for a private law firm since she turned 21. Today, she's sitting at her desk, typing up some paper work, and thinking of going to college.   Damn, I'm too old , she thinks. But then again, she'd heard stories of people older than her who went to college and finished, and made better careers for themselves. She definitely wanted something more for herself than a second-hand Honda she'd bought 2 years ago and a small cluttered apartment she rented with her Filipina friend.  Suddenly, someone's hands covered Heidi's eyes. Heidi panicked for a millisecond before hearing a voice behind her say 'Guess who?'. It was her boss-slash-boyfriend, Cody. Heidi slapped Cody's hand as Cody let his hands down. 'What do you want?,' Heidi asked, trying to keep her voice neutral. The previous night's fight came back into her memory, as she resolved, once again, to break up with him for good, and to not let him coax her into staying together this time around. 'You're so much prettier when you scowl like that,' Code said as he held out a bouquet of flowers he'd bought for her.  'We've gotta talk, Cody,' Heidi started.  *** Bitin ba?, basa ka ulet bukas hehehe. In Pinoy terms, ABANGAN ANG SUSUNOD NA KABANATA.... (hmm...pero 'di naman talaga kabanata, 'di ba, kasi by day 'tong kwento e. hehehe)

      I was just browsing through some bulletin board posts somewhere in this cyberworld and found this link: http://www.xanga.com/sororitygirl. The review said it was a really funny site so I double-clicked and got myself into sororitygirl's world. It was pretty cool. It's like "Clueless" on the internet. I'm getting you people who read this read her site so you get to laugh once in a while. Laughing is good, says me. We should all do it. Ha-ha. Big deal! :P  I like stumbling across really pretty girls who have a sense of humor. I think this Michelle girl is one bright lady going around pretending to be a girl-jock (is there even such a word?). Which is cool. She makes me laugh. But then, again, if I meet her, and she IS totally jock-ish, I'd roll my eyes and move on.  And you go back to work now! Nothing more to see here.  Shoo!

      I know quite a number of people over thirty and who are still single. But I never really understood how they took aging so gracefully when it was apparent that they were alone.  An officemate turned thirty-six today. And he had this quiet calmness about him. I can't use the word happy here because that would be too emotional a sentiment, and he had none of that. But he wasn't sad about it either. It seemed as though it was just one of those things that happened in life. A natural progression.   We've been cubemates for just about a month now, but I've always joked around with him for being a lot older than me. And he always brushed it off with a smile or a laugh like it was no big deal. I used to think that it was all just a scam. That deep down, he was really sad and lonely. Being thirty-five and alone. But today, he doesn't seem sad at all. In fact, it seems that he's delighted today. And I know most women who reach thirty and dread their birthdays.  Maybe it's a gender thing. Maybe men age more gracefully even when they're single. Or maybe it's just because men are more okay with being alone than women are. Or maybe because men don't overthink like most women do. Or maybe because men have far fewer pressures to be married and have kids by a certain age.  Or maybe it's just my officemate. Maybe he's just really an alone person breezing through life in his own little way.  But then, again, maybe I don't know him enough yet to jump to all these conclusions...  Blah-blah-blah.  PS. One day, when I know him better, maybe I'll let him read this. But til then, this little blog stays a secret. Bwahahaha.

      Since I'm new to all of this, I must start by saying a few things about myself and this darned blog.  First off, I am a girl. But People call me A****. Yes, A****. Blame it all on nicknames and the first day of my college life. I'm over twenty-one, but I ain't saying how old I am. I'll leave it to the wiser ones to figure that out based on what I write about. I'm unattached, work 5 days a week, currently assigned in The US for my work, and I'm one of the overanalyzer dudes. (The ones that ended up having their midlife crises before they reached the out-of-the-calendar mark).  Anyway, most of the stuff I write in here will be stuff I make up as I go along. So when I have posts like 'Trip a Paris', you must know not to believe me. Again, I make stuff up, okay?  Well, some of the stuff might be real, but I ain't telling which ones. Makes it more exciting doesn't it?  Hurrah for us all!

      Me and a couple of friends watched this movie last night. My friend, Poch, told me she heard it won for best foreign film. I was trying my hand at painting by numbers (a new-found novelty I discovered thanks to the movie Mona Lisa Smile {but that's another story}) when she popped in the DVD she bought online. My eyes were on the paper, and the first sound I heard that signalled the start of the film was moaning. Yep, moaning. My eyes were suddenly riveted to the TV, of course.  Sufficeth to say, the film had very good direction, but the story leaves much to be desired. From an average Filipino viewer's perspective, it was just another one of those skin flicks we are bombarded with. I confess I am not a very good critic of film. The only thing I have under my belt is 1 semester of Film Class waaaay back second year college. But I still think the label 'coming-of-age movie' is not proper. The only aspect of their 'coming-of-age' that was tackled in the film was their sexual awakening.  Sue me for bad publicity, but that's what I thought. But then again, my background on their culture is pretty limited, so I guess the film could be realistic if I knew much more about it. But the film didn't even give us sufficient background into that. So all I had with me when I viewed the film was that the 'coming-of-age' label must have been used as it was supposedly applicable to people everywhere.   And I went through the sexual awakening stage. And it was NOT AT ALL as dramatic or traumatic as that. Was that the point of the movie, I ask myself now. I dunno really. Go watch it, but don't blame me if you stand up from your couch depressed at the end of it all, when you find that you are not better off after having sat through the whole ordeal.

      Can’t really tell what’s happening to me. All I know is the day seems a bit more tolerable. And the work seems to go much easier…And emotions are a little lighter…Light, but not fleeting.  But it’s been so long. Too long. And I don’t know if I still have the strength in me To try once more.  Scared, I cower in the shadows. But when light comes, all you will see Are my shiny, moist eyes And my indefinable hint of a smile.  I don’t know how to let go And maybe that is my problem. I don’t want to try to let go. And maybe that’s the point of it all.  Through every path I took before, I always ended up in mazes Where the only escape or exit  Lay in my jumping into the quicksand And waking up in a strange, quiet and lonely place.  Butterflies….been so very long since I’ve seen them this delicate. Pains me to see them So afraid to stare at them too long Let alone touch them, For fear of finding out it’s all just  a dream.  And like a tree that’s passed through summer and winter, Sleet, rain, and warm bright days, I am old and tired. I think I am quite contented with what I have right now. Still clinging to the past. Still thinking that  yesterday is always better that today  Or tomorrow.  That child in the windowsill. I know she is kind. I know she means well, But when she comes near, I remember the pain of winters alone After beautiful summers And the hunger for cool water during scorching heat waves And I don’t think I can bear another one Of those fantasies Though the vision holds promise.  Someone, please. Don’t know what you can do.  But any gesture of kindness Is most welcome.  Note: Wrote this two and a half years ago. Seems that was a long time ago, but the feeling is somehow still in the air. Always in the stale air.

       Work like you don't need the money. Love like you've never been hurt. Dance like nobody is watching.   Someone sent me this email. It seemed really nice. Simple and real. And I wish I could still write nice poems like I did once before. Before I got into this mess that I now call my life. Yes, I have friends. Yes, I have money. And yes, I do as I please. Still, I am not where I once wanted to be.  Was it the lovely fairy that I left when I entered the world of maturity? Was it Santa and his magical Christmas that I left when I stopped believing that people did care? Was it the magnificent unicorn and its healing power that I left when I filled my head with talk of technology, stocks, investments, and garb?  I don’t know exactly when I stopped looking at the sky. I don’t know exactly when I stopped dancing in the rain. I don’t know exactly when I stopped listening to the sounds of the world. I don’t know exactly when I stopped dreaming. I don’t know exactly when I stopped laughing like a child. I don’t know exactly when I stopped. I just remember that life overtook me. And this is what life’s supposed to be. Then death must be such a beautiful thing. A chance to end the silence and renew my commitment to life.

      Note: I wrote this when I was falling crazy in love for someone a couple of years back. As one song goes, 'I remember the boy, but I don't remember the feeling anymore'....   Just thought that rehashing it might make me more of a believer in love again.  *************************************************************  I don’t know of anything there is to say that will encompass the totality of my emotions…that will grasp this deep longing within me that seeks to be heard, that seeks to be quenched…that seeks to be tided over by nothing less than a smile, a whisper, a caress.  Never thought it could be like this. That it could come this easy. And, even at this moment, I am still unsure about everything. Hesitant to accept this growing feeling that I nourish within me with every thought I have about him, about me, about us that I have.  I am drowned in this sea of romance, alone, yet never lonely. I wish to shout to the highest heavens and let the deepest of seas hear what sweet melodies are singing in my soul at this very instant. And every other instant I keep myself too from wandering even farther into my consciousness, for fear of trapping myself in the abyss that is my mind and body and soul.  No one can know for no one will understand. And why would they? This feeling is like no other I have ever felt, much less known to a tee. It is of elements that one only dreams of, that one only cares to imagine in that happiest of nights when the stars shine the brightest seeming to us that they will heed even the most intense of our longings.  This is not to say that I do know exactly what this is I am feeling. On the other hand, utter chaos is ruling my insides. Lined inside me is confusion, bubbling laughter and the ecstasy of sweet nothing and everything rolled into a sumptuous feast of delightful murmurs that no one, not even I can comprehend. Yet I do not wish to isolate any aspect of this growing feeling, for I might miss the entirety altogether. On the other hand, if I delve into this completeness too much, I might get sucked into the feeling until I am nothing but pure and sheer bliss. And that would not be good. For I would not be able to appreciate the bumps, curves, black holes, and white corners.  No labels, too, for that might confuse me more. Or it might confuse others into believing they too can feel this. Or that they can rationalize it. Or what may come after it. After this highest of high has left my system.  Dear God, I hope it never leaves, this wonderful feeling of nothingness and completeness all rolled into one. It might leave me empty, scrapped to the bone, alone in my deep solitude for nothing but it supreme and absolute return. And I do not know when I might come upon it again, just like I never expected it to creep upon me when it did. All I know is that I was content then, but I am in sheer delight now. And if I were to choose between the two, I do not know whether I would choose the certain path or this uncertain bumpy one with lots of curves and crevices.   There is nothing I know at this instant except for the complete knowledge that this is a conscious taste of what heaven must be like.

      For the record, yesterday, Feb 24 was a milestone for several reasons.... I let go and leaped into the unknown, with eyes closed and arms open I decided to try and live the 'good' life, starting today.  One of these, I'm gonna try to make last, the other is good for 40 days as my Lent 'panata', and then God knows what will happen when that's done....  Eeni-meenie-mayni-mow. You figure it out. I'm too busy looking at the good side of things to dwell on these matters. But someday, I'm sure it'll creep up on me. But until then, I'm free and happy, and lovin' it hahaha.

      A friend once pinged me a message. Do you decide to love, she asked.  The wheels in my head started to turn. Mind you, it's really hard to get into the mindset of philosophizing about love when it's had you nauseous from ups and downs and sideway turns for no less than four years.  I said it was a decision. Someone always chose to love. It was a conscious decision. BUt my friend disagreed. She said that the first moment you realized you were falling love was NOT a decision. It just happened. I did not agree.  My point was, even the thought 'hey, i think i'm falling in love' is an admission of some sort. WHen you entertain the possibility, you choose to think it. It does not force itself upon you. It's a decision in your mind to accept that new framework for seeing a possible chance at love.  Many romantics will disagree, I know. Stuff like 'it just hit me' and 'The first time I saw him, I knew' or 'I just knew the moment he smiled at me when we had that wonderful cup of coffee after that nice dinner'.   Get a grip, I say.  Love is a decision. A decision to think about love and think about the person you love in that context. Without that decision, you would never be able to identify that you had loved. It would just be a natural feeling of being really nice to a person (might even the reach the point of looking incestuous), in a silly twilight-zone kind of way, if you never chose to recognize love when it shows up on your front door.  Kinda like seeing an old drunk on the street but not recognizing that he is a lonely, confused, needy human being just like you.  Do you get me or do I still have to spell it out for you?  Argh, never mind. Time's a-wasting. Get on with your life and stop reading this.   Moral lesson is --- choose, choose, choose. Never play it safe or you'll never get anywhere spectacular.   And so in the words of my close friend Melv, 'Chow!' nyahahaha.

      Did I mention me and 10 other awesome people went to New Orleans on Mar 20-21?  Bwahahahahaha.  It was soooo much fun.   We had lunch at Antoine's, where (according to Che's rumor) you couldn't laugh out loud. The mood at the place was just too stiff. Granted, the food was fantastic. But the place was just a big mood-killer. hahaha. So we had lunch and immediately stepped out and bled onto Bourbon Street. And drank. And walked. And looked. And took pictures. And wandered. And laughed. The street reminded me of Eastwood streets (if Madonna had a concert there). The streets and stores were wild. Time passed by quickly....too quickly.  Two important things to note on the first day, though. 1) We went into this place called LOVE ACTS REVEALED or something. We stayed at the back, because some friends were ont he conservative side, and we didn't want their innocence to be totally shattered. WRONG MOVE!!!!! Private lap dances were held at the back (3 of which happened not 3 feet away from yours truly mwahahahaha). 2) On the way back to Bourbon street (for dinner) from the hotel, we passed the casino. Since it was my first time to enter a casino (yeah, yeah, shut it!), Miggy gave me a quarter to play at one of the slot machines. AND I WON!!!!! Won me six dollars in quarters. Gave Miggy half of it because it was his coin that made the win :D   Second day was memorable for two 'events' too: 1> Cafe du Monde and Landry's --- doughnuts for them at the former. At the latter, I ate my face off hahaha. 2> Buggy ride, and the Aquarium -- cultural, historical, natural. I was struck with awe.  So far, this has been my best travelling experience in the U.S. to date. And it wasn't even Mardi Gras when we went! Ha!

      You remember how, sometimes, you think someone's 'astig' because his family has connections that make life easier for you? For example, a college friend you're carpooling with happens to have a first-degree uncle who has a high position in the police force or military. You get caught by the cops for speeding a red light, and your friend just shows him his uncle's calling card, and you're off the hook.  On the other hand, remember when you read in the newspaper about this politician who got away with not paying taxes because he had connections...while you slave away at your desk and work hard to earn your keep, and pay your taxes, and live hand-to-mouth to save?  Well, the same abuse of power and position happens in the workplace. All the time. And some times are more bearable than others.  Example 1: You work as a day-shift nurse in a public hospital and have a friend who happens to be the night-shift manager. One day, he requests you to do overtime because one of his nurses called in sick. You say yes because: 1> he's your friend 2> he's a night-shift manager  IN THIS ORDER. You don't do it primarily because you fear he's gonna rat you out as being unhelpful. You say yes because you know what this means to him and his workload. And the nice buddy that you are, you help him out.  Example 2: You work in the quality control arm of Product A of a commercial food company. However, you used to work as an assistant marketing person for the same Product A of the same commerical food company. You inspect the work practices quarterly and make your report. Based on this, people will be reprimanded/fired/promoted. This quarter, you see that work practices for the Marketing arm of Product A are below standards. You let the manager of that arm know the results (as is protocol....your former manager when you were still at this arm), and he gives you a stern look and tells you exactly what he thinks you should do out of 'PAKIKISAMA'.  Do you report what you find and be ethical? Or do you let your former manager lord his pwoer over you?  I say, let him lick his own ***!  You do what you have to do because it is your job. He cannot presume that just because he used to be at a higher position than you are means that he can still COMMAND you to do stuff for him. For all he knows, he was the reason you wanted to be transferred from that department. Because he was never an effective boss.  And these are the times you hate people who have position and power over you...  But, then again, they will only have power if you let them. If you act all courteous or fall for his 'PAKIKISAMA' routine, then you would have let yourself down and NOT felt good about yourself..nor of him. And you would have given him the power of walking all over you using his position.  My twenty-five cents' worth: 1> Say no 2> Tell him details of where he failed and let him know that you will do your best to try to get Upper Management to listen to his side 3> (if you've got the guts) Tell him "'Pakikisama'? Alam ko yan. Ka-level ata nyan yung 'Trabaho Lang', 'di ba?" 4> Let him know that he can't change the situation now, but he can prevent it from happening again in the future.  I know it's hard being Pinoy most times. But communication is often the key. OPEN communication. Two-sided communication.   Remembering that honesty and integrity will (and should) always win over 'pakikisama' or any other cultural norm. And that power is just a state of mind.  Besides, like the anonymous non-person said 'F*** da norm'! (Feet daw ba?...yech...I HATE FEET!!!!!!!!!!!)

      Ever wondered why your boyfriend seems soooooooo dense, you just want to grab him by the hair (if he happens to have any on his head), and jam his head in between your door and wall until he realizes what your ahem-ahem words are about?  And, why, when you talk to all your other guy friends, they seem to always say 'Yes, that's what I thought you meant', and they're always right. How come they get it and he doesn't?  'You look great tonight,' he says. 'Thanks. I had a hard time finding something to wear. All I have is old stuff. I need to go shopping,' you reply in your sweetest voice. Boyfriend mumbles 'Mm-hmm' as he kisses you full on the lips. And you think you're in agreement. Two weeks later, you're still waiting for that hint from him that he remembers you saying you wanted to go shopping with him. He doesn't say a word. But he does wanna hang out tonight at your place. And so you say,' How about you come shopping with me?', with your cutest smile on. And then his face goes totally blank, as if you just said aliens were in town, and then he goes 'Shopping? But you don't NEED any new clothes...' 'But you said we could go,' you reply, slowly feeling really let down now. 'I did? We never discussed this before,' he innocently replies. You remind him of two weeks before and he says he does not remember you ever asking him to go shopping with you. And your face gets the beginnings of a full-on pout. But you drop the subject for now to avoid confrontation. A couple more days later, with no mention of it, you start the underhanded arguments, and then, finally, a full-on battle on why he should or should not accompany you in your shopping.  But he already said yes...you think to yourself, wallowing in self-pity and anger building inside you.  Plausible deniability, baby. Times like these, men just tune out or pretend to tune out or throw out some noncommitant reply just to get their women to stop yapping. And most women fall for it.  Stop falling for it.   If you want something, tell him directly. It's not that men are dense. It's not that women speak like aliens when they have requests. It's mostly because men can get away with it.   Hmmm. Okay, okay, women sometimes can too.   But, THE POINT IS, if you can't take shit, don't give shit. Remember that. Your relationship is only as good as your word to each other. If you can't talk with your partner about things you need, want, like, dislike, hate without getting a straight answer for him (and vice versa), then maybe you have to go bark up another tree. Coz this guy ain't biting on what you've got to say, babe. And being treated like a bimbo (no matter how smart or popular or rich or cool or handsome your boyfriend is) is no way of earning your respect, or your love for that matter.  Shove it!

      WARNING: A little mushy (okay, a lot more mushy) than what you guys are used to, but it's my faith we're talking about here. So sit down, shut up, and read.  I watched it last night. 'The Passion of The Christ', I mean.  There was no build-up like 'Jesus Christ, Superstar' and no insane mind-boggling finale like 'The Last Temptation'. It went straight into the praying at the Garden of gesthemani and continued all the way til Jesus' final breath. No details spared.   And I can't explain it, but somehow, it was like doing the stations of the cross, only instead of words in your mind to console Jesus and tell God how you want to be so much like the Son of Man, these are pictures. That didn't stop. They just went on and on and on. And sometimes, you just could not help but turn away from the horror of it all. Oh God, more horrific than I ever imagined. And it became a bit more horrible because I knew what was going to happen next. When he fell the first time, I knew he would fall two more times. When he was scourged at the pillar, I knew that he would not die, because he was still going to be crowned with thorns, and then crucified. When he said 'Father, forgive them, they know not what they do', you remembered that when he died, his side would be pierced, just so they were sure he was dead. And you knew this all had to happen. And you knew it like it was your own flesh and blood. Your own body. Your own life. Because, in a sense, it was.   It was my life. The life that any Catholic aimed for. To live life for others, carry his own cross and never fear death for beyond it was Eternal Life. Things that I have known since I was 8. Things engraved in my mind by education, strengthened by religion, lived by conviction. Values and spirituality that all had its roots from His life, His teachings, His love. Things I felt proud of. Things I'd get into arguments for. Things I was sure I was ready to die for. And then I doubted. Like Thomas, I doubted. Did I believe because I needed to believe in something? Did I pray because I needed to hear myself believe that someone could and would help me? And then I jumped. And oh boy, was it a freefall, sky-high, adrenaline-pumping, screaming amazing jump. Because I believed. I suddenly let go and just believed. And did not care. And just told myself 'Live your life the way you know He would want you to live it.'  Then human nature took over. Dead brain cells. Appeals for appreciation. Desperate attempts at feeling loved and desperate attempts to cover up rejection. Time passed and I became lax in my faith. And then this film. Like cold water after agonizing seconds of writhing on the hot desert sand with thirst. Only much more bearable and less painful. But brought me to tears when I watched it. Covered my ears. Shut my eyes. Bit my lip so I wouldn't scream in pain. It was too much. So much more than any man could bear. Alone. But then again, He was never alone.  Now, I'm thinking, if he could go through all that, why can't I give up smoking just for these 40 days (cut me some slack here, 'Hello my name is Sade, and I am a Nicotine Addict'...Happy?). It won't hurt as much...In fact, it won't even reach a tenth of the pain he went through. And He would be with me. Plus, this was for my own good. To stop my addiction with nicotine. My self-abuse. My self non-love.  So it was a brutally refreshing much-needed reminder-slash-wake-up-call for me. And it was a good movie as far as my non-Catholic boyfriend knew. Good enough for his non-roots. God enough for all of mine.  Hopefully, this renewed pump will last me until the next good sensible Catholic movie.

      I'm sure someone else said this, but Poch emailed it to me and it was very good insight....  "this is the way it goes... sometimes you're flush and sometimes you're bust; and when you're up, it's never as good as it seems, and when you're down you think you're never going to be up again. but life goes on, remember that."   For more of Poch and her wit/thoughts/angst/etc., well....she has to be your friend too!  Lucky me! Wooooohooooweeeeeeeee!

      So people wake up one at a time. I wake up and Babygurl is up, and then Jaz wakes up, and then Hensy opens his sleepy eyes, and then Xian stands up to get some food hehehe. I get out my digicam and video the morning-after scene. And then Diane gets up and goes to take a shower as Jaz comes out all fresh, albeit having slept at 430 am. And the time is just 8 am, or probably a few minutes earlier. Hehehe.  So people get up, and start having breakfast (tira-tira from the night before). I take my shower, and when I come out, everyone's up. Sleep overtakes me and I lie down to nap for a while. I wake up and the house is abuzz. Everyone's ready to go and Hensy goes 'Allan, ligo ka na, 1030 na.' I sit up and say 'Ha? E naligo na ko, kanina pa no.' Hehehe. And then everyone helps clean up the mess we made and the mommies in the house (i.e. Diane, Barre, Denise, and me) make sure no things are left behind by people. And then we leave. Mammee Barre and Daddy-O Hensy decide that lunch will be at Barley's Creek (place suggested by snowboarding coach Dave the night before).   But before we head on up there, we look for a place to do our snowtubing thing. We go to Alpine Ski blah-blah place. And we see that there is no snowtubing going on there. However, me and Babygurl find that kids (yes, kids --- ages 3-6, we're guessing) are snowboarding and skiing down the slopes and we say 'Kaya rin natin 'yan o' and started blaming the condition of the snow on our snowboarding slopes the day before. We are laughable heheh. But then we leave because every single person's body is aching fromt he day before. And then we head to barley Creek for lunch.  Sidebar: Everyone is hungry but no one gets food, all in anticipation of a sumptuous lunch. But Mammee could not wait, and finally overcome, had to take in something. So she went for some leftovers. And as she offered some to Daddy-O, we got to the place. Hahaha. Blame it on Mammee's low EQ, she said.  Lunch was very good (i say this in comparison to yesterday's lunch ha, which was blech cafeteria food). took a few pictures outside, and headed for the car. But no! Steven almost goes into another van, filled with Americans. He mistakes it for ours. Nyahahaha.   And then came the snowtubing place. We parked, passed by the tunnel (very, very cool, if I may say so) and we are transported to snow's version of Christmas. Hehehe. We sign the forms, pay our dues, and are divided into 3 groups. The other 2 groups try the family tubes first, btu my group (Daddy-O, Babygurl, Teban, and moi) go off into the single snowtubes. It was a blast!!!!! Ang saya-saya (clap-clap-clap, in the tradition of Mads). After 3 successful times (except for Babygurl who kept slowing down or stopping on her slope), we decide it's time for the family tubes. While at the line, we see the other folks single tubing, one by one, and we try to identify who's going down. And then, we see someone who (a-la slow motion on tv) t-u-m-b-l-e-s a-s h-e-r t-u-b-e c-o-m-e-s o-u-t f-r-o-m u-n-d-e-r h-e-r. Oh no, I was thinking it was Mads. And if my eyesight served me right, the person tumbled once in the air, and tumbled again on the ground before she caught ehrself. And then, she stood up, and went over to her naughty tube and walked down. As she stood up, all four of us said 'A, si Poch'. hehehe. It was awesome. Something to tell her kids one day, I bet.  And so we snowtubed once. And the exhiliration from the speed! OMG!!!!! Grabe, wala akong masabi.   And then we had an idea. Race!!!!!!!!!!!  We challenged the other group --Mads, Cha, Barre, and Poch. Game daw, game. Hehehe.  As we went up, my group was stategizing. And the other group was, well, having fun. And we had another brilliant idea! Video the slide! And so we did. We told the 'pushers' our plan, and they said 'okay'. One, Two, three, GO! All four of us faced the front of the snowtube, and when the tube went sideways, we all jumped to face the new front of the tube. It was soooo funny because we were so caught up in the moment. And we won, but we found out that Poch had made a scene while they were going down..... Cha, Mads, and Mammee Barre were all at the front of the tube to make it go faster, but Poch was at the back, clinging for dear life and screaming, 'Ayoko pa mamatay, tumalembang na ko kanina!!!! Ayoko na tumalembang'....... Hahahahaha. Everyone was laughing while Poch was on the verge of crying from her near-death experience. And so they switched Poch with Xian. And we still won!!!!!!!!!  The third time, we exchanged slopes, because they said our slope was steeper which resulted in us going faster. We begged to disagree. But the 'pusher' made a mistake and it was a false start, and so we didn't have much push so they won. Blagh! Two out of three still makes us a winner! Nyahahaha.  And then we were on our way home. Denise gives us the low-down of what she does and does not like in a man. And then some. Hehehe. Alternating between sleep and wakefulness, we got back to Arlington and said our goodbyes. All of our bodies aching like hell, but all of our memories intact.   Nice one!

Laging Business Class Boy  Okay, late dumating lahat. Late nagising lahat ng taga-Meridian (as usual hehehe). And after loading up the van and passing by rich friend BOFA, we were on our way.  Breakfast at some stopover place in Maryland. Event standing out --- Poch nagbreakfast magisa sa Bib Bob's because of her craving for bacon and eggs. Bathroom breaks and stogey breaks over 30 minutes later, we were on the go again.  Una, gising pa lahat sa van e. Kulitan, asaran, hiritan. And then, silence. Sleep except for Babygurl and Jaz, I assume.  We got to the place at like 130, gutomn a lahat, we checked out cabin #24, isa lang CR, pero walang lock. Arranged to change venue to #22. So change. Room assignments, pano? 3 rooms, 3 guys. Some crazy person suggested one guy per room....Hmm, pano na ako, thinks Allan? hahaha. I'm kidding, folks.  So, 6 girls in the 2-bed room 9oo. considered girl ako dito, teban :-P), jaz, barre, and diane in the 1-bed room, and the 3 guys in the other room. Of course no one believed na 3 talaga sila dun noh. Malamang merong matutulog sa sofa. So off we went to Camelback to get us some food and start our snow adventures.  2 words for lunch. Cafeteria blech. Kadiring food. Photo opp na lang. Chaka 80's songs. Pwede na yan. Memories of Sawatdee's winner budget food. Then we go and buy whatever we need to buy in the shop, and then everyone gets tickets. unfortunately, Allan and Poch inevitably convince everyone na snowboarding is better. Bwahahaha. The plot thickens. Joke, joke, joke. Closed daw snowtubing for the day e, ano magagawa natin? Jaz, Diane, and Mads (the girls) say nood na lang sila. Jaz is injured --- the excuse. Nadaan din sa pilit. Bwahahaha. Woooooohooooooooo. So everyone's dressed and psyched. And after a while, people start attempts at snowboarding (pero, it felt and looked more like 'sliding and dropping in the snow' nyahahaha). FYI that it is the 2nd time of Daddy-O, Lolo Teban, and my daughter Cha. Pero sige. Hensy is looking like a pro, next to all of us. Steven is catching up fast. Some folks venture over to the Level 2 slopes. You find out that the girls are girls by the shrieks and shouts 'AAAAAAAA' in different decibels and various pitches. Interspersed with 'Shiiiiiiit' and 'Shucks' and 'Awwwww (pinoy version of ouch)' and pained laughter. This goes on for around 2 to three hours. Painful, yes. And then.... the instructors come in.  And the real pain begins. They want us to skate up the hill. And glide without looking at the board, and look straight (even while the board is going sideways, which is not funny kasi di naman kami sanay maging banlag). And then there's mention of toe turns. And heel turns. And our minds are just going 'Kahit anong turn basta hindi na malalaglag' and 'the fence is getting closer, closer, closer.........AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'  .  And then 6 people -- Lolo Teban, Daddy-O, Anak, Babygurl, Xianers, and Mammee decide to try the beginner slopes. Me and Poch and Denise are just waaaaay too tired. And the girls are, well....they're girls. Pretty women need their rest, too, you know :P  And the folks take loooong. Very long. And they have the keys. And so we grovel while waiting. Our bodies feeling like lead 100 feet below the sea. Hard to move. Or laugh. Or think. We're hungry.  They finally arrive and everyone gets dressed and we go to find a restaurant. But all places are closed. So everyone is dropped off at home to get out of their wet, stinky clothes while Daddy-O, Babygurl, Mammee, and Anak buy food.  Me eats leftover pizza from Friday and the tuna lasagna. Sarap. Then me sleeps for a bit. Exhaustion overtakes and sleep is welcome. Food gets there. Things become hazy because I am awake and enjoying the food, but my mind wants to sleep. Babygurl, Jaz, and Daddy-O take a bath with colder-than-usual water kasi naubos na daw yung hot water. Someone amazingly whiffs out an ice cream cake for hensy and we sing haberdei to tz berdeiboi. Me waits a bit, and then take my bath. Buti na lang, by that time, may hot water na... Woooohooo. The gods are good to me tonight. Bartender Mads starts her sassy night, and people start drinking. My vision blurs from pure exhaustion and I go to bed. Naunahan naman ako ni Denis, FYI. Z girl who needs at least 8 hours of sleep, I am informed.   In the morning, I am told that Mammee, Anak, Jaz, and bday boy Daddy-O stayed up. Daddy-O got drunk, but does not admit it. They slept at around 4 am daw. O well.  Will try to tell you 'bout day 2 later. I have a meeting to attend. Day 1 was waaaaaaaaaay fun!   Bitin noh?!!! Hahahaha ;D

      Got this new term from a guy I had a conversation with yesterday. It turns out that there is another reason why men want to 'still be friends' even when you cross the friends only-hookup boundary. It's called backpocketing.  So, say you're in the M.U.-like stage with a guy. You know he likes you (i.e. you've kissed, or probably made out a couple of times), he knows you like him back, but you have not had the talk. And then, through the course of some days, you suddenly find that it has been very hard to connect to him (on whatever level).  And so you have a sort of 'talk'. And you throw the word 'friends' out there just so he won't think you're overly interested. and then, he hugs you, and throws it back at you. So you think: a) he held me while he said that so that means he wants us to be more than that. b) he held me while he said that so that means he respects my decision but he definitely wants to be more than that. c) he held me while he said that to lessen the pain for the both of us, because this is what is best at this time.  WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He said that because he wants you in his backpocket, i.e. he knows you like him back, but he does not like you back enough to continue down that road just yet. However, he wants to keep the line open so that when he does feel like he's 'ready' or he 'wants' you or he 'needs' you, there is still that possibility that you will still be open to him. Get it? He wants you on a  string labelled 'i'm not sure where we are, but we'll find out someday'.  And the typical idiotic cheesy girl that you are, you believe the best. You convince yourself that maybe you're not ready for a real relationship too. That this is the best choice. That he likes you deep down, but it is just not the right time now.  So you lose contact with this guy, just keeping minimum contact through 'how are you's' and forwarded emails. And then, one night, you go to a party, and he's there. And you meet him. And the two of you start talking, and it seems like this happened before. 'De ja vu', you think. Feels like heaven....Mmmm-hmmmm.... You start kissing and all that...  WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  You have been backpocketted.  Wait a few days, and you'll see. Everything will go back to normal. Except that it's his normal. Not your normal. He'll slowly slip into oblivion again, and you'll be wracked with the same exact thoughts that you had the first time you made out with him. And maybe will go through another one of those conversations with him. Do me a favor and record it, will you? So that the next time this happens, you can just listen to the tape, instead of feeling really embarrassed to have asked him again and gotten the same old answer and feeling overly used.  Some girls should just grow up and smell those awful dried sampagitas.  Get my drift?

      Have an ex. We broke up because of this girl named Shai. But they never really formally got together, from what he tells me (of course, he could be lying, but I doubt he is). Now, we're friends. And I'm over him. And I'm assuming he's over me. However, my whole break-up theory was, he needed to go out there and find out stuff about himself for himself. because he's always had this view of himself as someone who was close to perfect ethics and morals (this, he could contend, but who really cares). Now, he's at an all-time low, and we still talk. And, sometimes, I can be a real good psychiatrist and a really bitchy ex-girlfriend in the same instant. Rarrrrr.  zhinesade: hmm...well, like i always said...if you need to experience it, go through the whole thing with everything you've got ex-(rocker)-boyfriend: onga e... im kinda learning that now zhinesade: :-| ex-(rocker)-boyfriend: im trying to be as low as i can stomach zhinesade: yep. zhinesade: you're a man. being a man is low enough

      Sometimes, when you're bored, chatting in cyberspace is a good way to keep you occupied and make you think of stuff you wouldn't normally think about. Like the elections, or politics, or relationships, or likes and dislikes, or obsessions and compulsions.  But these private messages....These are waaaaaay weird. Just goes to show that there are a lot of lonely people out there, just reaching out, wanting to be acknowledged.  jigjiggler: hi hows it goin? wanna say i like ur profile and u r very pretty,  zhinesade: thanks jigjiggler: welcome sorry if i was bothering u just showin respect zhinesade: np   ******************************************************** deldar_us: hi zhinesade: yes? deldar_us: hi zhinesade: ? deldar_us: deldar deldar_us: u? zhinesade: what? deldar_us: asl? deldar_us: plz deldar_us: ok  ******************************************************** tony_c872:  zhinesade: ? tony_c872: You're attractive... zhinesade: um....thanks... tony_c872: lol...sure.

      A friend told me about his Vegas trip.   One of the more interesting things I was told was that Celine Dion had a contract with a Vegas hotel to put on a show 5 times a week for five years there. I had heard of this, but I didn't know the details. It turns out that she had only 2 conditions --- 1> that she be built her own auditorium for her show, and 2> that they would build a replica of her house behind the auditorium so her children would feel at home when they visited her.  'Replica?' I asked my friend. I didn't think that was the right word. I think of replica and I imagine something like a wax form of Elvis Presley or a miniature doll house to look like your old house. Not a real house that looked and functioned in the same way as the original did.   For example, a copy of the Mona Lisa exists in lots of books, and have been replicated to become posters for hotels and restaurants. But they aren't as valuable as the original. Why? Because the strokes are different. They don't carry the history of the original Mona Lisa.  On the other hand, the house built behind the new auditorium in Vegas will function in exactly the same way as her old house. Additionally, it's of the same scale. So, I hesitate to call it a replica. Hmm... Gimme a term... ho-hum.  CLONE! It was a clone. It was not made with the exact same materials, but it functioned and was the exact scale of the original, which meant it was also valued the same as the original. But, then again, the word 'clone' has a cultural context that makes most people associate it with humans or living things. So to make my 'call' (as CSI calls it) more plausible, I had to look in the Internet and see what these two words meant to back up my theory.  Dictionary.com had this to say:  rep·li·ca    (rpl-k) n.  - A copy or reproduction of a work of art, especially one made by the original artist.  - A copy or reproduction, especially one on a scale smaller than the original.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [Italian, from replicare, to repeat, from Late Latin replicre. See replicate.]  clone (kln) n.  - A cell, group of cells, or organism that are descended from and genetically identical to a single common ancestor, such as a bacterial colony whose members arose from a single original cell.  - An organism descended asexually from a single ancestor, such as a plant produced by layering or a polyp produced by budding.  - A DNA sequence, such as a gene, that is transferred from one organism to another and replicated by genetic engineering techniques.  - One that copies or closely resembles another, as in appearance or function: “filled with business-school clones in gray and blue suits” (Michael M. Thomas).   The last definitions for both say it all. They confirm my theory.   Ha.  Off to lunch now.

      Have you ever felt that someone you actually thought was close to you suddenly took you for granted or changed in such a way that they seem distant? A friend perhaps, or a significant other.  Well, it doesn't really matter. But the phenomenon begs to be discussed. Or at least recognized.  People seem to think that being taken for granted happens after someone gets really close to you and sees your personality under a microscope, instead of under a picture frame. They see all the flaws, and forget the whole picture of the you they had first gotten to know, adore, and/or love.  It sucks. I, among many, should know. I have been on both the giving and receiving end of this horrible travesty.  The question remains, though. How do we get over it?   Does spending time apart give you the space to see them in the macronucleus of things? Or do the flaws remain, and Daddy Distance's only work is to make sure the taker gets away from the flaws as fast as possible.  Or is it just a matter of nature taking its course? Average people (and i do mean average, as in typical --- single, around my age, independent) do not want to be tied up in too much drama for fear that they just might find themselves helpless without the other one day. Okay, maybe not helpless. But unconditionally loving the other.  What's so wrong about that, you may ask. Come on! Think about it. It's not by some universal force that we grow a realtionship with the taken. There's effort involved. And after all this effort, you see all these flaws that could hurt you, would you still accommodate the taken? Or say, 'Hey, it's been nice, but i gotta get somewhere safe.'   In this case, 'safe' is being in an emotional state that the taker can handle. Something that cannot hurt them at will. Which is something takens can do to takers if taker don't take the takens for granted. You getting this?  Let me give you an example. Person A learns to swim when she's 12. She loves swimming, the thinks. Swimming takes up most of her time now. But she's not good enough with swimming to win any medals, or get any elevated recognition, much less get a scholarship at a university. And her grades aren't too high, because her priority was swimming. And then, one day, she meets a lady who also used to love swimming, but quit, because there was no career in it for her. And her sister died of drowning, and swimming did her no good in saving the sister. So she lost hope. And Person A thinks, 'Is swimming all I want? Is it going to complete me?' Is it everything that is important to me?' And one day, after much thought, but not much options, she suddenly just drops swimming and goes on with her life, trying to erase the whole memory of swimming. And she lives. And she's still normal and happy and content. Complete? Well, I don't know about that. But she lived.  Get it? Hmm. Not quite, huh? How about if you replace the word 'swimming' in that previous paragraph with 'person b'. Do you get it now? It's a risk. And either way, you'll probably end up fine. And taking someone for granted is really not a sin. It's just a choice. But always a choice that should make us stop and think. Is it worth it? Will it make me happy? Make me complete? Make me a better person? Am I taking away from myself if I leave this other person behind?  Me? Preaching? I'm not preaching. I have taken so many people for granted, I'm pretty sure I'd be amillionaire if I could take them all back. But the past is a shade, the present is a nucleus, and the future is a cloud.   I should be so lucky to stop and think every time I start doing this. God knows I've done it more than I have cared to.

      --- Did you know that men would rather attend their guy friends' bachelor parties rather than their wedding? Found this out the hard way, ahem. Hahaha. On the other hand, I know from my girl friends, that they would never miss their girl friends' weddings for the world. Kinda weird, isn't it? Well, like my friendwork mentor told me, 'Whatever you think you'd do in a given situation, that's most positively not what your men-lets (in lieu of boylets) will do.' Go figure....   --- Did you know that some dog owners in the US actually fight with each other (and some even take each other to court), when bad things are said about their dogs. Apparently, it's defamation of character....What the ----!!!! Never mind.   --- It is best to water your plants in the morning or in the afternoon (3pm-ish, I think...). Watering at night is ill-advised as this will attract all sorts of bugs into your garden. Watering when the sun is at its highest point in the sky is even more dangerous, as your plants' tendency is to "overdrink" the water ( and then they burst hahahaha. Kidding!).   --- I still get carded. Apparently, in the US, being 'carded' means the doormen (big guys with arms so wide they can even stand straight when their arms are by their sides hahaha) have to ask you for an ID to make sure you're over 18. To have this done to you once is acceptable. But having the same doorman approach you once you've gotten in (to check again) -- irritating. And if the bartender asks for your ID again when you order your drink....nasty! Oh well. I can't help it if Filipinos look so  youthful! :-D   --- I have discovered that I have so many weird phrases from different people (and some that I invented), that some new friends kinda think I'm weird, or just very stupid...I say stuff like:            "He-llo-ow, Telepho-own"            "Bahala na si Batman"            "Don't shy"            "Kung ayaw mo, 'wag mo"            "Come what may" (when asked about plans)            "Low ESQ" (I mean EQ haha, but I say this all the time as a Tribute to Tanduay) Okay, okay. These are just a  few. But I swear, I'm weird. Oh well.   --- I find that my name actually makes people remember me a lot more than I remember them or their names. I'mv ery bad at names. Veeeeeeeeery Bad.   --- Some men actually do say stuff just because they think it's what women want to hear. I've had a lot of male friends, but they've always been very honest with me, seeing as I'm always one of the guys. BUT, I met someone. And this new friend is nice. Sweet. One time, though, he did mention that he does that to women. And another time, later on, I felt like he was doing that to me. Gotta stop it. Gotta find a way. Or I'll die. Hahaha.   --- Very different courting/dating culture in the Philippines and in the US. Back home, a guy and a girl could be a dating for a year and would still not consider themselves officially "together". In the US, however, after a few dates, they would. They'd talk about it and, surprisingly, their "anniversary" is set retroactively. Yep, they think back to their dates and determine where the significant moment really was. Ain't that strange?   --- Geting your skin burned while sunbathing or going to tanning salons actually makes you more prone to skin cancer. True. sad for white people and light-skinned Asians, but true. Long live Brown people! :-P   That's it for now. Gotta go. I apologize for not having more interesting updates. Too much work. Very little play. Hopefully, I get to try out painting this weekend. I promise to tell you guys all about it.

      Okay, I'm making this short and sweet.   One of my avid readers (ha! Wish ko lang), Poch, noticed something weird about my blog last Friday. All my latest entries contained the letter "P" in the title. Did anyone else notice?  Could it be her CSI potential shining through?  Or does she love me so much that she notices all the little things?  Or does she just not have enough things to pass her time with?  Hekhekhek. Love ya, Poch.  By the way, the next entry was supposed to be entitled "Baby Ryan's Party and then some..." but I saw the "P" in there and decided against posting it today. I'm waaaaay too superstitious these days to tempt fate into making me overthink about that darned "P in the title" thing. Haha.  Me?  Weird? Of course.  Anyone of a lesser caliber would never do with my woof-meow-moo boyfriend, my workaholic-shopaholic-foodaholic-alcoholic-yosiholic-roadtripaholic friends, ang my overly worrywart family. Now, if you're reading this, and don't belong to any of these groups...hmmm....think about that for a sec. And then ping me or send me an email or something. Hahaha. Because I might not even know you're alive. Or I might just be ginoring you on purpose.  Gotcha!

      I feel like I'm getting fatter. Seriously.   I know a lot of women say this, but I just finished updating my photos online, and I have SEEN pictures of myself from December...and boy, have i grown horizontally since then!!!  Dammit, I need to start losing me some weight. And I don't like gyms. In fact, it's treading the line between dislike and hate...and infinitely approaching the hate side of it. Maybe it's just the whole dressing up to go to the gym that gets me psyched out. I mean, be with people who shop and say 'I need gym shoes, gym sweatpants, a gym sweatshirt....', the list goes on and on and on. I mean, why can't I just wear a normal shirt? Why can't I just wear normal boxers? I keep imagining myself entering the gym in my normal oversized shirt and wornout jogging pants and everyone just stopping their regimen to stare at me in disbelief. Weird, I know, but it kinda scares the s*** outta me.  And I can't very well go jogging outside. The gym is a controlled environment, where only a certain number of people see you...But how about people who judge you by the way you look when you're out jogging the streets....Besides, the weather's been a big ugly woman, changing her mood EVERY SINGLE DAY these past two weeks. And I don't hear that she's going to start being consistently spring-cheerful int he next coming weeks.  And so my only solution ---- PLAYSTATION!!!!  I was in New York last weekend, and Poch (a friend of mine), has recently bought dance revolution for her PS2. I remember I had tried playing Dance revo when I was in third year college, and I got addicted. As I stepped onto the pad, evverything seemed to come back to me in a rsh. And in one night, I got addicted. And I noticed that I perspired. A lot. Coooooooool!!!!!!!!  Now, my next goal is to buy a playstation and get into shape while I'm here...and maybe get really good at dance dance revo. I heard there were contests in some places....And maybe, like after a gazillion years, I could compete...Or maybe, in my daughter's lifetime, they might offer a coruse on it in college. And I could teach. And I'd eb a hundred years old, but I'd beat the hell out of all my students!!!  Woohoooo!! What d'ya think?   "Dream big, live big", baby.

      I was supposed to write about how I think people around here are making such a big fuss about the Cicadas. They're harmless animals, except that they're very icky to look at (like flying cockroaches). I really thought that they'd be coming out in hordes (like how we see hordes in cartoons) but they didn't. Granted, there are a lot of them around (can't seem to go out anywhere without seeing them dead or alive), but eating them? Or wishing them all dead? Just because they look disgusting? Some people I see around here look more disgusting than them. Should I go out and say I wish they would just shrivel up and die? Ho-hum. Maybe I'm just one for the underdogs (or under-cicadas, as the case may be). hahaha.  Anyways, finals of American Idol tonight. Fantasia will win, hands down, unless everyone else thinks like me, and then maybe Diana will win. Which isn't very bad, considering AI winners haven't really been very popular after they won (Where's Kelly C. now?).  Blah.  Going to Fort Lauderdale on Saturday. I'm very, very excited. I think I'm way over-excited. In fact, I might start packing tonight....if I get home early enough. Have loads to finish at work before that. You think I better get back to work? Me too.   Ha.

      She was drunk. He was not. She had far too many Red Horse beers. Much more than she ever drank in one night before.  The club was crowded. She was dizzy and hot.She decided to sit down and stretch her legs out on the couch that she and her friends had claimed for the night. They were lucky they were friends with the waiter. He saved them a spot because he knew they'd be here tonight. Her 2 friends went to the bathroom. They needed to freshen up before they all went back to dancing the night away. She didn't care to go. She was too drunk.  She was trying to keep her eyes open. But she couldn't see much. Two guys who were facing the other direction were blocking her view of the dancefloor. As if sensing her stare, one of the guys looked around, and said something. She signaled that she couldn't hear him. It was the music. Too loud. And the buzz in her head was making it hard to concentrate. 'May I sit here,' he asked again. She could smell him. Unlike this whole place which smelled of sweating bodies, he smelled like a fresh bath and CK1. She nodded her head and looked away. He was not good-looking at all. Yech, she thought to herself. She smiled. As if she was any better to look at tonight. Her friends came back. And they snuck in between them (the guy was now talking animatedly to his friend who was looking at her). And they went back to dancing. A bottle of Red Horse later, she was sitting beside the guy. And he was asking her for her number.  She laughed. She was impressed because he had grace. But it was also very funny because she'd be leaving the country in less than a month. And he was not her type. But he spoke in clear english in a low tone that made her think he was the most sincere person in the room. Or maybe it was the beer. She decided to just continue to let loose and dance the night away. She came into the club, thinking she was invisible and as thin as air. She got out of there with a glimmer of hope in the invincible something. And, outside the club, he looked a bit more attractive than she gave him credit for. And he still smelled good. That was a start.

      So just in case you just tuned in, I have added a couple of small trinkets in this site...I added the Counter, the Weird Fact of The Day, and the Today in History which are all very itneresting. It also gave me a chance to play around with the template code a bit. Mind you, I don't have an educational background in coding GUI's. I do have memories of computer-based training I had around three years ago that dealt with GUI's. I'm trying to use what knowledge I still have in my memory banks of it. Hahaha.   I've started trying to be ambitious with my blog. I'm going to try and put links in the posts to see if I can do that...Hmm....Seems pretty easy enough. But first, I must try to find something worth linking to. Wish me luck!  Anyway, no one's used the comments yet. :( This makes me sad. Makes me think no one's looking at my site (very few probably are)...Hahaha. Oh well. Try it out, if you have a minute to spare, will ya. It'll be a big help to my cyberself-confidence.

      I like the new look. Unfortunately, I'm nut a BloggerPlus user, so no free additives in my site for me, except for capability for comments from people...(someone please try it out...should be flattering to get at least one comment, so I feel like someone's actually reading my blog hahaha).  Eh, who cares, anyway. Only a handful of my friends read this anyway. it's more for my sake than for anyone else's. Hahaha.  Sidebar: I've been surfing, and some people do take blogging to a whole new level (so much so that I am a little embarassed to publish any more of my very mundane thoughts). Very deep, serious stuff.   Interesting.

      WW 2 Memorial Korean War Memorial Washington Memorial Vietnam Memorial 2941 restaurant  These are the spectacular places I went to this past weekend. The memorials were full of people, probably because it was very sunny outside. I had a lunch picnic under one of the willow trees bordering the Potomac right before we did The Mall tour haha.  2941 is the best restaurant I've been to in DC. Folks near here should try it. People who are planning to visit DC and who happen to be food conossieurs...I tell you, this place is awesome.  Anyway, gotta go home and do some exercising. I feel fat from all the food :-P

      Snippet of an online conversation i had with a friend(let's call the friend Diva) in manila. We were talking about this guy who had introduced himself to me at Pier1 in Boracay. He(Guy) asked for my number and said maybe we could go out if he visited Manila. I said, sure, once he got his college degree(he dropped out) and passed the board exams.   diva: alam mo ba diva: nagtext sa kin yung guy sa boracay diva: yung sa pier sade: HAHAHA sade: kamusta daw? sade: baket ka tinext daw? nasa manila? diva: gusto mo malaman kung baket? sade: yep sade: baket? diva: HINAHANAP ANG KAGANDAHAN MO DAAAY!! diva: grabe ka talaga sis! diva: hehehe sade: hahahahahaha sade: natawa naman ako dun sade: pano sinabi? diva: anong ginawa mo dun at naloloko yata sa beauty mo diva: nangangamusta lang sade: hahahaha sira diva: tapos tinatanong # mo sade: aaa sade: e di bigay mo sade: number ko dito :-D  (take note: I am in the US right now)  diva: sige sige sade: hahaha joke lang diva: anong # mo dyan? diva: bibigay ko talaga diva: para di naman ako nahihirapan diva: hahaha diva: na-inggit daw diva: hahaha sade: hahahaha sade: e ngekngek  sade: sabihin mo sabi ko dapat may trabaho na sya dito sa manila pag nagtext sya sa akin noh sade: :-P sade: ask mo kung meron na syang work sa manila diva: wala diva: balik probinsya daw sya diva: para mag-aral yata diva: or something diva: di ko na pinansin kasi ikaw naman ang sadya at di ako diva: hahaha diva: :-) sade: hahaha sade: bitter :-P diva: hahaha  My point is --- I didn't know that encouraging words, and a challenge, had such a strong effect. I thought it was just some random guy, and that we'd never hear from him again. I'm glad he's continuing his studies. I know I was not the only reason he continued his studies, but I'm glad to have helped contribute to his decision (I'm assuming a lil arrogantly that I did  haha ).  Note: I really am not interested in anything he has to offer right now. I love who I'm with. It was just one of those instances that make you believe you have a hand in the way the world works and moves.  But, then again, not really.

      Here's a shout out to my daddy-o. I was finally able to call him last night (after 4 months!!!). It was so nice to hear his voice.  Another shout-out, this one to my sistaru who's named 'Capi' (short for Capitan hehehe), who I was also able to call last night. She's the new superwoman, juggling between helping out the family, managing her personal life, social life, and starting up her career. Kaya mo yan, Kapatid!  Finally, a shout out to my best friend Jappy, who I was NOT able to call last night. He wasn't at home...Grrrr.. Hahaha. It was his birthday on June 12, and I just wanted to greet him. So, to anyone, within reading distance of this message in Manila, if you know someone named Jappy Lim, please let him know I said 'Happy Birthday' and 'I miss you'.   ******************  On a related note, I watched the first episode of "Who wants to marry my Dad" last night. Very interesting. The father was a bit handsome, I have to say. And the children looked like they had good heads on their shoulders. But, then again, there was also a bit too much crying going on. Tears when they had to boot two people off even before they met the father???? Harsh, but I don't think it's worth a tearful. Oh well. Hmm..Maybe that's what reality TV does to you...  ******************  I also was able to watch an episode of "For Love or Money" last night. There was a twist in last night's show (for those in Manila, I suggest just surfing the web for a summary of the whole show plot, if you haven't seen it ;D). The remaining girls were given the choice to see how much money was on their checks, in exchange for halving it. This one girl who was starting to fall in love with the bachelor (okay, in my mind, 'starting to fall in love' is in quotation marks, coz this is tv haha), decides that she just wants to show the guy that she doesn't care about the money's worth by looking at her check. BUT, the guy (and here, I have to say that guys can really be very clueless sometimes) thought that the reason she looked at it was because she wanted to know what the money was worth -- that she was basically a money-hungry lying conniving b**ch. Haha. Which was, of course, totally opposite from the truth. Grrr. Men are from Mars. And women are really just attracted to aliens. Ha.

      I won't laugh as much this Friday night.  Paul Johnson was beheaded, I read in the news. Everyone's got their own say in the topic. Mine is just a basic realization of how a war can seem so distant, especially since I'm not American. I feel like I'm not in any way connected to it. But Paul is a man. Human, like you and me.  Another tragedy that will live on as a testament of how idiotic man can be.   When exactly did we regress to apes?  (Did we ever really progress in the first place?)  I was taught to believe that we did.  (Oh come one, surely you don't think people are that bad.)  Yes we are.  (They have their principles. They'd rather die fighting for it. Surely you should understand.)  I would die for my own convictions. But kill others for it?  Someone make this foolish mind of mine understand, please.   PS. So do I weep for the son of the atheist who wanted 'under one Lord' out of the pledge.

      In the building where I work, there's this old man. He's not very friendly, because his job is to check that everyone entering the building has authority. You enter the building and you pass him on your left, in his oval desk that's called the reception desk. He looks at your ID. If you forget to lift it up (for him to see), he'll automatically say, 'Excuse me, ma'am,' so you look back, and show him your ID. Now, a lot of people hate his guts. Including me. You get to the office, it's pretty early. You have a mental list of things to do, you're already running late for an early morning conference call, and they have the nerve to stop you to check your ID. If I had half the nerve (and wasn't very scared of being bumped back to the Philippines in a heartbeat due to any unlawful act), I would show him my ID and ask him to shove it up his a**! I didn't want to be here this early on such a sunny day out in the first place.  Anyway, so everyone hates him (and his alternate receptionist too).  And then I saw him. Yesterday. He was eating a snack at the cafeteria. Alone. And reading a book. And looking every bit as normal as you and me.  It hit me like a wave of nausea. Only heavier. I was one of them. I was one of those people whom I detested so much in my younger, more idealistic days. It's Peter Pan's feeling when he grew up.   When I was younger, my curiosity always led me to look at people as people, in their singularity. Barenaked. Now, I can only see them in their roles. As cool yuppies, as geeks, as doctors, as waiters, as receptionists, as guards, as bus drivers. No faces, no hands, no hearts.  Oh man.  This old man. He's someone's son. Maybe someone's father. Maybe someone's brother. He voted and helped determine this country's fate. He laughed when he was happy, and cried when he was sad. He's experienced a loved one's death. He's experienced pain. Physical and emotional. Heartbreak. Fear. Hunger. Thought. He's human.  Am I?  I'm drowning in everyday's non-life. And forgetting the essentials of why I'm here in the first place.   Aren't you?

      Ho-hum. I didn't save the YM conversation, and that's my stupidity. It would've been easier to just paste it all in here and let the YM exchange speak for itself.   But here goes my mind's version.  You know how when you're an average high school kid, you think you can pass for a wallflower? I knew that feeling. I was in a high school were there was the 'Popular Crowd' and most everyone else were just extras, trying to get a speaking part.  Anyway, one day, this guy calls me and asks if I could be his grad ball date. I say 'Sure' in a heartbeat, not because he's cute or handsome or popular, but because it was just flattering to be noticed and/or asked. Let's call him Toffer. Okay. So Toffer introduces me to his friends, one of whom was Borg. And Borg just sucks me into his world, not because he is extremely handsome or popular, but because it felt so nice to just be around such a jolly person who was also a good conversationalist. And so we talked, and I developed a small crush on this Borg fella. But I didn't do anything about it because 1) he was Toffer's friend, who started courting me at the time, and 2) I convinced myself that nothing was going to come of it, because it was just a stupid crush. But me and Borg still talked, way after their grad ball was over. In fact, we became such good friends that I even invited him to my small kiddie party  (in lieu of my debutant ball haha).   And then college happened. And my first true love. Most other fellas in my life (i.e. best friend, yes best friend Jappy, close family friends, etc), take the back seat. Some of them, like Borg, I think fell off the wagon. We lost touch.  Seven years later (more or less), Friendster comes to Manila like a plague, and I am swept in. One day, out of sheer boredom, I try and search for Borg. And lo and behold, he's there! So we become friendsters, and start talking again.  Fast forward to last Saturday. I come home from clubbing and decide it's not time for bed yet. So I log onto YM. And Borg is online. We start talking. And then he asks me about Michelle Bayle. And how she's a 'sexy star' in Manila these days, and how she used to be a schoolmate, and how her features changed, and that she was prettier way back. And then he tells me (in his words, not mine) that I could be a star. I said, 'No way!'. I was a wallflower, nothing more. And he disagreed. He saw me as a lovely woman, who was nice inside and out  (Now, this is my version. I told you it was better if I had saved the YM exchange. Darnit!).  Anyway, we both finally found out that we had a crush on each other way back in high school. The reason he didn't say anything was because Toffer was his friend, and he knew Toffer really really liked me  (btw, I gave Toffer the old heave-ho kaboom outta there before I started college).   And I smiled. And I actually started to laugh that night, all alone, in front of my laptop. Not because I was an excited kid with a crush, but because it felt wonderful that someone saw me as more than a small girl with long hair in high school. He actually saw through me. And I guess, in a way, I saw through him too.  Thus, the Pseudo-Swan feeling.  Not to sound too full of myself, but these things have been happening to me a lot these days. There were days in the past when I truly believed no one saw me. That I amounted to nothing. And then there are days like these. Days when you realize that you misjudged the past. That people actually saw you more than just as a small girl with long hair. That people actually noticed that you made a lot of sense, that you could sing better than average, that you had nice lips, and animated eyes, and a good heart.  But don't anybody worry. We're not planning on reliving our high school crushes. He's quite happy with his girlfriend and I'm more than content with my boyfriend. It was just nice going down memory lane and seeing things in a new light.   Life's nice like that, don't you think.  Everyone deserves a sunny walk down memory lane once in a while, I think.

      Someone just pointed out another stark cultural difference to me. It seems that Americans are more sensitive when it comes to weight-talk than Filipinos are. I know that back home, it's very common to hear your friends say 'Tumataba ah,' or hear your sister say 'Antaba mo na.' In the US., however, people take offense when you tell them 'Hey, you've gotten bigger,' or worse, 'You've gotten fat.' I asked my friend what was the most unoffensive way to casually talk about weight.  Kasi di ba sa 'Pinas naman, mostly kebs lang tayo pag sinabihan na mataba ka noh.   Apparently, you should say something like 'You seemt o be gaining a  little  weight,' or 'You looked a bit on the heavy side in these pictures.'  Duh. Duh. Duh.  Hahaha.   It's all so funny.   People around the world are dying, and all we can think to be defensive about is the way people tell us we spend too much time with food...   What about when people think we spend too much money on shoes? or bags? or --- God forbid --- on whitening products, whilst small kids are forced into prostitution for lack of food?  Still laughing?  Worse yet, still offended?

      Okay. Deep breaths. I feel like I'm drowning. I guess this is my payback for thinking some OFW's are lame.  It really doesn't matter if you're in the US as a nurse or as a consultant, you're still very far away from your family.  And, in the beginning, it's fun and exciting. That is, until your Manila life catches up to you.  And then you start missing friends. And your family. And your sister who you fought with all the time when you were back home. And you miss the sights and sounds of it all.   And then you think, 'Well, hey, the reason I'm way out here is to help them.' But it just doesn't cut it sometimes. Money is important, that much is for sure. Wihtout it, you wan't be able to put food on your plate, or put your kids through school, or pay for electricity, and water, or pay for the house. And that's supposed to justify the distance and the loneliness and alienation (and add to that that sometimes, you think that the folks there seemed to forget you existed).  I don't know what it is, really. I can't point a finger at exactly what I'm feeling. But it's something close to the realization that your time can be as valuable as your money.  Time and Money. If you had to choose, which one would you rather take? Enter Exhibit 1. You were one of the wealthiest people in the wrold, but you had no time for anyone else because work took all your time. So your friends were your clients and your calls and your documents. But you had all the money to give away to the wife/husband, kids, siblings, friends. Would that cut it? Enter exhibit 2. You're a bum ...hmm.. not a good example nor realistic. Okay, okay. Say you had a low-paying job as a waitress or as a gasoline boy. But you came home to a family that loved having you around. That grew from your wisdom. That was guided by your hand. And you didn't do overtime, so you had time to spend with them, watching them grow up, and make their mistakes, and learn from their mistakes. And you were there when they were at their worst, and you were there when they were at their happiest. But you ate hand-to-mouth and you were barely making ends meet. Would that cut it?  I can't make the decision. Not right now, anyway. But then, again, I'm thinking extremes here. Maybe that's what depression does to a person. I don't know.  Maybe I'm taking everything out of proportion. I'm just trying to understand where all this loneliness came from. If it's something that I can fix, then let it be fixed soon. If not, then maybe I should just shrivel up and disappear until the feeling becomes my friend. Then maybe I won't try to fight it too hard...and maybe then, all will be roses.

Sana'y hindi mo tuluyang binaba ang telepono nang sinabi kong "kung gusto mo siya, kaya kong hindi na tayo" dahil mahal kita ngunit ang layo mo.  Sana'y hindi ka pumayag nang sinabi kong "sayang, tapos na, bakit kasi nagpunta sa piling nya?" kahit andito ako't minamahal ka.  sana'y nagpumiglas  sana'y nagpakabingi sana'y naghintay   ng isang munting saglit  Baka sana'y nagbago ang ihip ng hangin at natulak muli ako  tungo  sa piling mo.

      Literally.  It's been spoken about as a fantasy for some(most?) men, and as a really good cocktail drink at bars, but this is the first time I've actually seen it done. Literally.  Unbelievable. They could not have been more than fifty feet from me and my companion. Yet, there they were, doing the deed. Shameless (I say this with a neutral tone at this point).  I'm not one to judge, but I asked my companion if that was legal, and he said 'No'. Of course, he couldn't see what was happening because the stage was set to his right, and he was looking left (me). Ha! I got the good seat.  Now, let's think about this. Is the sexual act illegal outside of closed because..... ???  A couple of weird explanations come to mind:  - we'd be no better than dogs  - people would get into accidents if they see these goings-on and forget to pay attention to what they were doing (i.e. surfing, driving, mowing the lawn)  - because sex is something that should be kept in the bedroom (i.e. kept between the parties involved, nto spoken about, something that people should be embarrassed about).  Two out of three reasons I could think of were socio-cultural in nature. Interesting (Of course, not to say that these are the ONLY possible reasons. They're just the reasons that come to MY mind).  Enter Da Vinci Code. Where sex was a celebration of man and woman become one, witnessed by followers/believers.  I leave the rest of the thinking up to you. I'm not saying that what I saw was judged wrong or right in my eyes. I'm not even saying that you should judge it wrong or right in your eyes. I'm just giving you a taste of what goes through one's mind when faced with realities like this.  I still say I disagree about the fantasy, only because even my feet have a hard time liking the coarse sands of most beaches, let alone thinking other people would love to lie and roll around in it.  Okay, okay. This is a wholesome site so I better stop right there.  So where was I? Haha. Ah, I'm sticking to the bar drink, I think.

      Hahaha.  I had to force myself to start writing this because, by tomorrow, I know I would have forgotten most of the nice things that went on there.  The thing is, though, there's nothing much to say. We stayed at Fort Lauderdale and went halfway to Naples, and back down to South Florida.  WORDS Millionaire's Row Cruise Billy's Swamp Safari South Beach Pahhh-teee Las Olas Boulevard and A1A Beachfront Avenue (I hear Ice, Ice Baby in the background haha)  THING IS Don't get me wrong here, and Florida folks, don't start the hatin'.  Lemme explain a bit. See, the place was great. But my company was AWESOME. So, the sunny place was overshadowed by memories of who I spent it with.  Pretty hard to explain. You'll understand when you're in the moment.   IT WAS A DREAM. If I need to explain to you, you've never been in love.

      Yep. That's what the sign said in my high school. And the sign was everywhere too. Not just in the corridors, it was on the walls of staircases, in the cafeteria, even in the library.  And now, here I am, working in the US, and people don't seem to have the same rule of thumb.  And I thought that the KEEP RIGHT rule was rule of thumb here too, because, hey, everyone drives on the right side of the road, right?  I go down to take my yosi break (doot-di-doot-di-doo), I turn right at a corner, and there I am, face to face with a tall african-american, who just turned left on the same corner. I mutter 'excuse me', he mutters 'sorry' and we do a little shuffle, coz I try to move right and he moves to his left. I then move left (not easy, mind you), and he moves to his right too. In my head, I go "What the ^@$#!!!!"  And so I think, maybe it's just a general rule in my country. Just like it's a general rule int he US nto to honk your horn unless absolutely necessary (and it's not the same way in Manila, believe you me). But I may be wrong. I come from a third-world country called the Philippines, and that's my excuse.  They should put that rule down somewhere in US books. Maybe it'll  end up preventing a war. Or maybe just prevent people from making their own lines in the cafeteria.  Hey, it won't cure AIDS, but when you read KEEP RIGHT, you hope people remember that and try to dig deeper and see why it's such a good rule to have in your life.  "Okay, Judge, here's the deal. This is my first offense, and I have always managed to KEEP RIGHT before. Gimme a chance will ya?"   Might work, you think?  Well, maybe you're right. It might not work when you're talking about murder or millions of dollars. But what the heck, i'd give it a try if a policeman pulls me over.  Doot-di-doot-di-doo.

      Three men are writing about me in their blogs.  I initially thought that that was quite flattering, to tell you the truth. It's my little secret. Only I know that I have become a topic. A TOPIC.   Not a person, but a thought put into words. That's all I am, apparently.  In one, I'm one of the really genuine girls he quickly  fell in love with; in the other, I am the evil witch who pretended to be the fairy-tale princess; in the last, ... well, that's for me to know and for you to find out (ha ha).  Anyway, nobody really cares what they think of me except me so it's not such a big deal for you, I know.   Five minutes from now, when I kiss my boyfriend, I really won't care too.  Feisty.   Rarrr.

      See, he never called her pretty. He never told her that he couldn't live without her. He never asked to see how her day went. He never told her how happy he made her feel.  He didn't like her outfits, her belly, her hands.  He didn't like the way she sounded so corny, so mushy. He didn't like the way she brushed her teeth or the way she was picky about food. He didn't like it when her hair was down all the time. He didn't like the way she complimented him on things. He didn't like the way she thought of him as full of potential.  But he liked her. Or at least he said he did. No, wait. He never really said that either.  He just talked. Rambled. Messed with her mind. Until he got what he wanted. And then she asked for more. Like love. And he was wary to give it to her. But, finally he gave in, probably more out of annoyance than anything. And for a while there, they pretended to be in love.  Until one night, he fumbled. And she saw through, but wouldn't make herself believe that this man was a boy. Just a boy.   She held on. but he threw her down. He needed to be alone. With his buddies. Yep, with his buddies, alone.  And then she left him alone, and then he screwed around with someone else's head and left her to shrivel up and die.  And he thinks she's stupid and fake for being bitter. For making him think that maybe she was a bit pretty, that maybe her clothes were not too bad that maybe she did have a mind of her own that maybe she was not always patient and kind, but she tried.  In his head, this one mistake of her feeling betrayed and being bitter about it. That was her downfall. That made her unworthy of him.  Well, to tell you the truth,  I think he pretty much convinced her she was worthless as shit.  And now he hates her for acting like one.  Hey mister, you just can't drive away, pointing a finger at her. Well, I guess you can. That's what you've always done.  Pointed fingers at their faults.  And you're perfect, right? You're very ethical, and very honest, and very much the man that your sister would be proud of.  Grow up.   No one's perfect. She was bitter. She admitted it.  Didn't you listen? Or were you just too wrapped up in the mind games you played with yourself to care.   Bitch about her. Wish her dead. But don't go judging her actions without knowing her side of it.  I always gave you the benefit of the doubt, even when you fucked up pretty bad.

       Some people think it's  funny, some people think it's quirky, and some people think I'm just exaggerating. It just disgusts me. Really. It does.    Dead skin cells, I mean.                        "Most humans naturally shed up to 3 grams of dead surface skin a day, some males make an extra contribution of 0.3 g/d in the form of dust from electric shaving. Although it may seem contradictory, it has been found that frequent showering increases skin cell shedding. Other research indicates that the majority of dust in a domestic bathroom is dead shed skin cells, especially after energetic towelling. "-->   urlLink  http://www.vent-axia.com/sharing/dustmite.asp       .         As I was saying, I loathe dead skin cells. It doesn't mean I shower less. I'm fine with people shedding dead skin cells. What I hate is when it scatters in closed places, i.e. fully-airconditioned homes, the metro, airconditioned buses. And people think it's just dust from the air, but it isn't. It's DEAD SKIN CELLS.      "Skin is alive. It's made of many thin sheets of layers of flat, stacked cells in which you'll find nerves, blood vessels, hair follicles, glands, and sensory receptors. Older cells are constantly being pushed to the surface by new cells which grow from below. When the old ones reach the top, they become wider and flatter as they get rubbed and worn by all your activity. And, sooner or later, they end up popping off like tiles blown from a roof in a strong wind. In fact,  every minute 30,000-40,000 dead skin cells fall from your body!  In approximately a month's time, your body has made a whole new layer of skin cells! "-->   urlLink  http://yucky.kids.discovery.com/noflash/body/pg000146.html

      [Spinderella cut it up one time! Hit me Come on]  CHORUS Let's talk about sex baby Let's talk about you and me  Let's talk about all the good things And the bad things that may be  Let's talk about sex  Let's talk about sex  Let's talk about sex  Let's talk about sex  Let's talk about sex  for now to the people at home or in the crowd It keeps coming up anyhow Don't decoy avoid or make void the topic Cuz that ain't gonna stop it Now we talk about sex on the radio and video shows Many will know anything goes Let's tell it how it is, and how it could be How it was, and of course, how it should be Those who think it's dirty have a choice Pick up the needle, press pause, or turn the radio off Will that stop us, Pep? I doubt it  All right then, come on, Spin  CHORUS   This song just felt appropriate for Belle de Jour. Check her out. I spent 4 hours reading through all her posts. Just because it was sooo real, yet so different from how we (Pinoys) talk about it. Our sex lives, I mean (if we ever talk about it at all).  Love it, hate it, adore it, curse it, but read it, before judging it. Her commentaries make one smile and laugh. I laughed quite a few times reading it.  But, then again, if you are on the conservative side, like I know some Filipinas seem (i.e. pretend, appear) or really are, then just move on along to the next link on my sidebar.   PS. It's subtitled 'The diary of a call girl'. She lives in UK, and she loves what she does. Quite the eye-opener, if you ask me. Go on, read it. We'll turn around, and pretend you didn't click that link ;D

      "I dunno. Let's stop this conversation right here," Guy says. "I've have had more fights&nbsp;with you than with any other girlfriend I've had," he said&nbsp;to Girl, who was sitting beside him on the metro.&nbsp;   Now, a normal observer might agree with Guy. But I don't. I think they were arguing at best, disagreeing at worst. Not fighting.   They weren't speaking in elevated tones, their faces were not registering anger, and neither one was even gesticulating.   Now, I've had my fair share of arguments and fights with ex-boyfriends, friends, and family.  And the way I see it, arguments are non-emotional (logical) arguments put forth as facts and/or reasons by either side with the intention of persuasion of the other party. Fights, on the other hand are always more emotionally driven, and meant to persuade the other party, not always by reason, but by emotion, in an attempt to gain power (i.e. "Who won the fight?") over the other.   Arguments can lead to win-win solutions and/or reasonable ends, but fights, mostly just lead to hurt or resentment by one --- if not both--- parties. Most younger people fight, because emotions are misconstrued for convictions. And adults argue, because they actually want to get the facts straight. (Aside: Now don't get all technical with me, because I know you might point out that some adults act more immaturely than teens  . But you know what I mean).   So what am I&nbsp;saying? Nothing, I guess. Now, alt-tab your way out of this post because if you disagreed with what I said, I'm sure you didn't understand my point. And that's fine.    Really.

      Okay, okay. Blogger's downtime is over. And I went to the link to download the damn thing to be able to post pictures, but it's not freeware!!! (says it's good for only 15 days). Call me cheap, but I don't want to spend a single cent on this blog, only because it's already time-heavy. To add one expense to upgrade it means it's just as easy to add another one, and then another, and so on. Time and money, what all relationships need. But I don't intend to have a relationship with my blog...I just wanted to share some thoughts was all.. Can anyone help me get freeware? Email me at zhinesade@yahoo.com....  In the meantime, I've tried out the free account at pbase.com. I've added a link to my 'gallery' (4 pictures, cahm ohn, jeez, stop being so critical :P).  Sahmbahdeh help meh, pretty, pretty puhleeeeeeeezzzzzzzzz.  Update:  I also added my humble ofoto portfolio hekhekhek. Feedback, anyone? :D

      So I'm not the biggest expert at photography (yet hahaha), but this guy(owner, I presumed) in a store in Orlando (corner Sand Lake Rd) sold some tourists a digital camera that he said was 6 million pixels. In my head, I think '6 million pixels??? Does that mean the memory card's total amount of pixels available for use or what??? Maybe he meant megapixels.' But then, I had never heard of 6-megapixel cameras selling for 199 dollars (a sale from the normal 350 dollars cost, he said...I later looked it up, and there were indeed 6-megapixel cameras, but not this brand). The folks, father and daughter took the bait and bought it. I remember that I saw them looking at the box briefly. In my head, I thought maybe the guy was telling the truth. But something seemed fishy.  I commented on the quick sell and the owner, being all chatty, told me about the good deal. He said the 6 million pixels had very high quality. And then he commented that he looked at the pictures I took (I was in the place to have pics transferred from my digicam to a CD) and said they were 'OK' quality. Then, he asked me how many 'million pixels' my camera was. 3.2, I said, again correcting him in my head, but trying to act polite. He rambled about what much better quality the camera he was selling had, etc, etc. But I looked disinterestedly at him, and maybe a little disgustedly (hey, the guy had the Razor Ramon hair, but had a very ghetto-looking face, and a hawaiian shirt on) and he moved on to the next customer, as the other sales guy was figuring out what was wrong because he couldn't successfully copy my pics to the CD.  Anyway, as the man walked away, I asked this other sales guy to see the box that the camera they were selling came in. Sure, he said. I looked at the camera, and it said 3.0 megapixels. WHAAAAATTTTTTT!!!!!!!! Those folks were cheated. And the camera wasn't even from a known brand. And so I started getting pissed for the father-daughter combo, and then Mr. Razor Ramon faker came back over and commented to the other sales guy that it was not his laptop that was broken (yes, they were using a laptop that was actually for sale to copy my pics into a CD), but my memory card. I could feel my ears heating up. Mustering my last sense of decency, I politely asked the other guy if I could take a look at it. After they spent almost an hour trying to copy the pics over, it took me all of 10 mins to do it. And I paid them 19.99 for it.  Photo Cheat.  And so many people think these things only happen in Manila.  They might have more spending power than us, and speak english more clearly than us, but values are values and an honest day's work is an honest day's work, wherever you go. A camera is a camera, and a lying cheat is a lying cheat.  Pictures never lie, mostly, whether they're 2 megapixels or 6. People do. But then, again, as photographers say, it's all a matter of perspective.

      Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take ya to Bermuda, Bahama, come o pretty mama....  Nuninuninu...  Nassau, Bahamas was excellent....I literally swam with the fish. For at least 50 meters. Continuous. Do you know how good that feels? To have fish swim right beside you for at least 5 minutes in sea? Awesome. Got me a freshly carved dolphin and some trinkets for my sistahs. Went parasailing and saw the whole Blue Lagoon island (if you've heard of it --- yes, this is where they shot those films...). 5 minutes of heaven. No other way to describe it. Send me a message and I'll send you the 15-second video fo the panoramic view from the height we were at :D  Orlando was a different story.  SeaWorld Orcas and dolphins, otters and sea lions, manatees and mermaids, alligators(only upper teeth are visible when mouth closed) and crocs(upper and lower teeth visible when mouths closed). We rode the 2 rides that they had. Kraken was a lot of fun! You will not be let down. Islands of Adventure Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm a kid at heart, what can I say. And you know how people who TRY to follow the straight and narrow, how we loathe people who try to butt in the line? ( in Pinoy terms, mga singit :P) Well, here, it's legal. When you get the express pass plus, of course. So we got there at 1. And rode all the rides worth riding with a maximum wait time of 10 minutes (this one was at Poseidon's Fury ---  a walking tour, not even a ride). ha. Ha. HA.  HA .  Back to work.

      Friends and family (naks),  I will be gone for nine days. Not my fault, really. Meeting up with the boyfriend's family in Canada, and staying at their cottage for a week (more or less). Now I say cottage not to sound too English (moohaha), but to explain that since they say it is very relaxing there, the family has carried the tradition of 'no tv, no radio, and of course, no internet connection of any sort' for many, many years now, and woe-is-me-yours-truly cannot break said tradition.  So me's say farewell for the moment. Rest assured that me will be back with mutterings, grumblings, bitchiness, ranting, ravings, and horror stories for all.  PS. For the addicted bloghoppers, I posted a new link. Read wittandwisdom. His writings are very, very good. It almost reminds me of someone I used to know...but not really. Haha. He has writings for every kind of reader there is. Very addictive, I say.  Ciao!

      Do you watch those late-night shows "Blind Date" and  "Elimidate"? I normally don't, but there was nothing on last night as I was flipping channels, so I peeked at it. What I found was hilarious...It was almost like a filipino comedy series. Hahaha. Here are some snippets (of course, they're my mind's version...but I tried to stick as much as possible to the lines I remember her saying)...  Girl: so what do you do? Guy: I actually own a small internet company Girl: oh really. What is it? Guy: I sell shoes for pets Girl: (short pause…) hmm…so you went through college to sell shoes? Me: Okay, maybe she has a point. In a philosophical kinda way….  Guy: So what do you do? Girl: well, I have a lot of jobs… Guy: Really? Like what? Girl: well, I’m an administrative assistant and a receptionist Me: Oh my, dami nga!  Girl: All I really do is work, shop, and drink. Me: Hmmm. I am so impressed.  Guy: (sun is still up) Are you hungry? Girl: No. I just want to drink. Guy: Don’t you wanna eat first. Girl: No. It’ll leave less space for the drinks. Not eating will make me drunk faster. Me: Wow. Powm-chickey-powm-powm is in the air for this guy (wink wink)  Girl: Let’s drink up (holds up what looks like a pinkish iced margarita) Guy: Uhh..okay.. Girl: I might get ice head. Or what do you call that…freeze brain…freeze…brain…freeze…oh, brain freeze… Guy: I’m not sure it’ll hurt you. Me is gagging from laughter…  Girl: I may be bubbly but I’m smart… Me: Yes, darlin’. We believe you.  AND MY FAVORITE REPARTEE from this couple: Girl: (talking about her hair getting darker as she got older) I’m actually starting to doubt my parents because of my hair color Guy: (chuckles) oh...maybe the milkman was over huh…(chuckles...getting red in the face) Girl: (5-second pause..) Are you making fun of my skin now…? Guy: What? (confused look) Girl: Yeah…milkman…milk…my milky skin…. Me: Huwaaaaaaaatttttttttt!!!!!!!! Mooohahahaha…  And that's all for tonight, ladies and gentlemen. ba-dump-bump-tshh (lights out, curtains down).

      Sigh...  There I was, hoping, nay, fantasizing about being able to audition for American Idol in DC before I had to go home to my beloved Pinas. I had actually already told 2 pinoy-coworkers and the bf.  But woe is me.  I went to the idolonfox site (sorry, no link here, am too disappointed tsk tsk) and read the FAQs etc. I thought my only prob was going to be that I was not a US resident. In my mind, they would not find out until I got the yellow paper, at which point I would have at least gotten the autograph of Paula (aw shucks) Abdul, Randy (whassup dawg) Jackson, and if I was lucky, Simon (bitchiness at its finest!) Cowell. But it was not to be.  My citizenship would be no problem, I saw --- they said you only had to have a valid legal working visa. Cool. But then there was the "pre-nup-like" agreement that you had to sign, saying in very many words, that they could sue you if they got you for a callback and you did not appear, among other possible scenarios. Darnit.  (Aside: I assume most of you guys know what callbacks are hehehe)  OKOK, so I may have gotten away with myself because, God forbid, I have a bit of talent with a mic (I know, the x would agree that I was dreaming. My voice, according to the x, was average). But still, in my overballooned head, I wouldn't want any part of court proceedings, which deterred me, finally. So, no, dear fans (or 1 fan and staunch supporter lang pala..si xian, hahaha), I will not be trying out for AI this year. Imagine all that airtime, though. Down the drain. Haha.  Yes, I am a dreamer, if you haven't yet figured out.  I long to sing in front of millions of adoring fans (which I guess most people dream too, lest I be too weird for social contact). I am no different from you. I sing in the shower, I hum at work, I sing while on my cig break, etc. But, crikey, I will be 5 minutes away from DC on August 18, and I will let that possibility slide. Oh well.  And I thought Zhinesade was going to be the next (and better, moohaha, I wish) Jasmin Trias.  But.  Let my frustration end here. If this not the time, and this is not the plan, then I will head on, bravely, into the unknown night.  Chin up.
