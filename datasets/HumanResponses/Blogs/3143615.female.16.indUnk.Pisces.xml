      What happens when you push away the love of your life? Is it over? No, Not totally, never really. No love never dies, true love is always there inside you.  And even on your saddest days it springs up in your emotions. A well that never dries. I wish not to hate those who have hurt me, but thank what has grown out of me and grown into me. What we must go through and what we put ourselves through is all for good.  Fate? What is Fate? God has our fate in his hands, it is weather we accept it. He holds it out to us, but we must except and take it and hold on to it with every bone we have. Because once you let go,  It is like a Butterfly once you opened your hands it will fly away to its own rest of its own choice. What is love? How is it that I find myself in love yet in so much hurt?  Is this what love is? If so why should I love? Who knows what love truly is? Love is such a powerful word and with so much hurt comes with it, yet without it we are empty. What would happen if I never had let myself fall in love? Would I be better off? Or the same? I miss you so much; you are part of me,  But you are not mine. You are not mine. You are no ones,  You Gods. So fly to him, fly into his palms and remember me when you go. Remember me. As I look to the sky I see your face, I see your smile. I hear your voice in the air. But can you hear me? And what happens when you realize you are the reason for your love going away? And that you just can’t go on anymore, and that maybe you were in a fairy tale and you closed the book. How do you go on? By Grace of God. But would of you can’t go were he is, because it isn’t your time. Just fly away, and remember when you look back remember every day is eternality. But would of this love come back to you? And what of that “you” was me? And you knew you screwed up? What would you do? Because you know you were on fire with that person near. But does it go out? Doe sit go away? Does this pain leave? When will it go? Will it? But is it good? Am I still on fire? Because he was on fire for something much higher than you, For a higher reason on earth then for you. Would of he wasn’t of this earth? What would you do? Would you be on fire too? What does it mean to be on fire? Only you will know. And when you do, Will you understand it? Will you fly away too?

      What is my life worth? Does anything even matter? I fail at most things, yet i am accompleshed in my learning on how to live. I don' understnad books or school, i don't understand degrees but i understand writting and music. I understand people better than most poets may know their handmenship. So what is so special about that? Nothing really, i don't see very much to write home about- but would of it was something worth whiled to someoneels and nothing was ever projected to me? That would be enough for me... So what do you think? Is this life worth it to you? Or shall you go on with your own emotions and forget about that your life, day is closeing to an end and you are getting closer to being in the grave thann accomplishing any earthly thing. So am i harsh to say i find nothing worth working for- but niether do i wish for any to slack off but find peace and true joy where you are. Is God ther? Maybe- i guess that is for you to desside.

      Life isn't what we want, life never is. I don't really care for this anyways. But even if the sun were shining i would be cloudeed up in my mind. I don't know where to look and i don't know where to hide from my own mind. God deosn't care anymore, But i know hes ther. Maybe it is only i who is not seeing him in my light becous maybe it is he who is standing near.

      To Day~       To day Is a New day! Thank God for that.... Wouldn't it suck like hell if every day was the same day every day and we had to relive every struggle? I guess we would get pretty good at answering those question reasked for enternity?         Well, Good mornig to the world and all who despice such glorey - good morning to you too. It is a crisp cold moring here in Meridian Idaho, the faint light is sprinkeling over the moutains offtain thought of as giants. I feel the cool Spring breeze through my thick Blond hair, ift is an April moring and all seems to be well. I wish to just lei in bed, the feeling of nothings wrong and evry thing is just perfect and know one is awke. I love this feeling, lieing in my bed with the oversized quilt tuck all around my cold body. I love this moment in time when the world is frozen in time and nothing stirs axcept the fat Robin quietly contemplating his next atact on the squshy warm. This is my favorite time of the day. I could care less what i look like or what i seem to say to the first person to wake me from this woderful place of eternal rest. Nothing is better than my bed.  I long for rugh arms to hold me in bed, but i know that i shall wait so thenit will be even more perfect and woderful when  i lie next to the one i love, and most of alll the one who loves me, even with my messy hair that gets fluffed from tossing on my poofy pillows, this is what i wait for, this is what i dream of when i lei by myself in the mearly mornignwhen nothing stir except my mind. This is my favorite part of life.

      Tea for the rich Wine for the poor A stick for the noble  & A sword for the humble Bread for a king Cake for the servant An ox for a night & A   fine steed for a peasant A stone for a wizard A ruby for a blind man A castle for a ghost & A hut for a leader Why has it all changed? Who deserves what? A prison for a pastor A palace for a murderer A home for an animal A street for a child A mountain for a bug & A Weed for a bird Why is this world so lost? For a cross for a savior A nail for a King  A crown of thorns just for me & Do we suffer as He? No, never as He –yet the lost; For they do - not know.                                -Rebekah Christy Hoffman~

        Once in a blue moon life is good. Once in a good life ther is a blue moon. Nither have isseniehter. But why should i am just a person . Humans are fillthy and sickning to me. I wish my blood were pure of mans sin, and golden light. But yet niether will this ever ezist. I beleive in no one, i trust no one, i love no one, i feel nothing, i don't even no what love is. So how could i know what love means or if it be true love or just a kind word for lust or i am sorry i hurt you? But what does it matter ? Lfe is fairy tail one once told me, yet i have yet to seen the happy ending and the dancing in the clouds. Maybe i am looking in the wrong directions. Goth be it by day and light be ith  never,  I live for no one but my God, but where did He leave to ?

      Sometimes do you ever want to throughup your brain and see if you have one? Or cough up your toung so you would never talk again? Or wish away your thoughts?  Life is confusing, do you ever realize that every one is different around every one? I know i  do it, but who is the real you? Is thta even a reality? Like my buddy said, "Reality is An Allution".

      So, today is a new day? I was just chatting with some old friends at Sonic when i realized - "wow" "i am not haveing any fun". "And really when have i had fun lately?"  Not in a real long time. O well doesnt really mater. I like sertan people, but i change when i am with them. Why is that? Why is it so hard to stay yourself, isn't thast why they like you in the first palce? Not becouse you are a clone of them. I do what i hate and think what i would say later. never what i want. I don't understand .  I   hate how i mold to other peoples hands so easily. I am like a soft peice of clay that can squeez into any form. But my own .  Why is that? Is it that i don't have my own form? Or that this is my own form?  Does it  even really matter.

      So what if we watch movies with dead coarps eating a living child alive an dwe pay to see it. Would if we watched such to calm outr minds so when we saw such in the reality of life we would think it to be just a reflection of what we saw in the film, yet it is in the fill because everything in Hollywood paid on screen must come from some sort of knowledge of some sort of rueth , for if it weren't than how do we draw up such elaborate images such as demons if there is no such thing.  If it is on screen does it mean it is just entertainment? Or is it just a erotic force to brain wash us to believing a klie that no other forces are watching and fighting for us. Not all in the Physical are seen by all who look, but by whom they choos to allow to see their feaICR FORMS.   So yes it is true, we are not alone, and nor have we ever been. It is not a battle of fleshely hood, yet Spirits and good vs. evil.   And yes there is such a thing that goes bump in the night- i know for i have heard and seen enough to know better to trust any ones faulsy words of we are alone.  If ther is no spirittula than ther is no physical .  So think me crazy, yet crazy i may be, i hold the trueth and when all els faill truth will set us all free.  So what do you think?   A-coona- Mo-ta-to! He-he no- i don't know.... ;)' Gall i am thinking again!

         "Sometimes i just don't know what to do with myself. I am so confused at times in my short tiny life. If i wer a bird, i would fly around all day just looking for  my special place to alight, but not just any place. I am so picky, yet i can settle so easly. I thought i was over this timmed issue, but  i guess i am still yet i dwelled in it. Seeing this up close has opened my eyes again, to realize i think that you are still the one i wish to be with. Silly as i seem to be, and though i am. I still fall short on my own promises and go toard what i have come to love so dearly, and hold so truly. I lack nothing in this world, just knowing i am worth wild to be waited for by soemone. But can i do it so. Yes i truly beleive as i say i am willing and able to waite for this enlightening being i so dearly love. I miss you, but am happy that not all is lost. And even if a ship is wrecked by sea, ther is always a way to shore and peices that will remain from the ships deck and forver it will lay at the bottom of the sea with every so often a peice on my shore. Reminding me no tof the deaths, but of the survials of this wreck. There are always survials if you allow them to swim past the burning implections of you bitterness and grief , than into peace and acknowledge ment of life with pationts and yerning for the futures lightness and fellowships of the heart held loved ones. Who are htere for ver. The stars are at my grasp."

      Muscles grow and thought glow,  but light is shalow, and love is made of gravel.  IJustice is nothingless, crime in foreverness  darkness si here,  your words are not so near,  the clouds are my friend and rain my voice  your eyes the ditches dirty with grim,  I have nothing to give you, but a sorreful face  and a saddened lei of nothingless price.  so take your please and pleas get off your knees  i have you no love, and you have no face.

      Sometimes i feel unworhtey, of what i have. Sometimes my mind is gone with thoughts that make my squirm inside. I rather not think of life so useless yet what other way is ther to look at it? But i think myself wrong at times for being so stuperstious and wonder why i am not overly calmed by your voice. But instead i am overley frightaned of looseing you, why must i look only for the worst in this life when i have much good to be pondering on?

      Cylie- baybe girl, where did you leave your heart? Cylie my love you have nothing but hate and stained sheets to sleep in. Cylie, my girl you ar enothign in his eyes - you have no love nor hate nor grace your eyes are empty and nothing will ever let you be freed. Cylie you are dead, but you think you live, you suck the life out every ones soul you live within your head but are rotting in the soul and smelling of old. I hate you i love you are me i ahte you for this deed. Go and die again, for you have never lived, go and ide for him and he'll never remember you , you'll nevr em,ount to his love he is nothing but a god. You'll do better dead and alone for even to have love is to live within the self ptty of loenness forever and beyound it. So Cylie girl don't fret your dead now finish liveing your dream.

      I wanted to be loved, i wanted to be pure. I wanted so much, but nevr had it, never got to be it... i wanted to be special, i wanted to be yours. But i never was, i thought i was, but never was. I never lost anyhting so presous, btu i now have. But you lost nothing, you took my heart. You nver even asked for it. But i gave it... Curse myself, never shall this ahppen, again. For i have nothing to give, you have my heart, and i ahve nothing but emptyness. I love only one, but no one loves me, for love is emptyness... Love doesn't fill yoyur empty heart, or stomech. Niether did you.

      No sometimes i feel it soming, i read ur mind, i know your thoughts, i hate your mood, i hate your voice! I know you better than you know yourself... You are nothing, you are my everything, I am nothing without your bruzing touch that sickens my heart... I am worthless unless you beat my emotion in ward. This is all i get? This is all i know, This is what you gave me.  But you left, but you are still with me, i am alone even when there is another in bed. I am alwasy sad, but i smile when crying. i laugh when my blood seeps thru my skin.  I am controled by nothing, i am controled by every breath i take and evry breath you push out of ur lieing motuh.  You rape me evry moment with your words, i once had a prince who loved me, but he died from a bitter kiss of hate, And now i live with his corsp whio hunts my lusting heart for his touch.  I die, i live, i breath, i gasp for death to take my hand...  Where did you go?  Why did you leave me alone agin?  But i am strong, my anseters hung gods from there tress, we fought we stood for war, i am a warrior and will fight top the death i will not back down, i am not a quitter. i will fight! i have picked up my sword and i havent washed your blood off yet i will lick it off and spitt it across your face and tell u to F off from me. I am not yours any more- i never was, I am Gods...

      Today is my first day of freedom, my licens. I was suppost to just drop off books at the libray but after i went for a drive. I went to the skateboard park and watched them foe awhile than peeled out and went into the country side , music blaring me singing horribaly and loudly. i am free, Adio slave, now i am free! Yes the perfect song fo r me... But as i drove further and further i realized after i passed my friend Saras house past black cat and the Kitkatclub i  didnt want to go home. My gas was half fole. i dont want to go home i wanted to keep driving away and away from here. I don't know my home, i dont wnat to g back to what is called my home by so many. I justw anted to drive away and be forgotten, i don't want to be her. i feel my blood bubble at the sound of driving away i want to fly away. fly away like a raven.  i wish i was gone now, i want to go.... I know where i should be but i dont know where that is exzactly. i want to go, i want to drive away from here. The wind in my hair the music geting fuzzy for being so loud the sun in my miro the past behind me the people and fomilliar gone. i want a new life i want to buz in and out of lives. i dont wqnt to ever stop driving , i want to be as the wind ever going never stoping for no one or nothing... i love my family and friends, but i need to go it calls my name, i need to get out of this place i need to go... My haert raceses as i pull away from my hous thier hous as i leave the city as i leave everything i once held dear till i recked it all, now i will make it bettre . ther was a time i never thought i would live to be this age to be free, but now i want to live to get away and then maybe i will die then. But will be independant of everything and everyone. i have to boundrys or finces or friends or family i am nothing to know one. i am nothing, but i love it, i have nothing to hold on to and nothing to be held to. no one can stop me now , i have felt the wind i ahve taseted the poisned wind i ad now i to am disloyal to every one and everything and will have my own way and will be my own person. I have been given my key to freedom and will not take it lightly, i will go and fly my own pace my own way. I qwas once held by evrything but i am not now, nor will ever be again. I will not be held down anymore! i will fight to the death befor i get sucked into this Whatever the Lord wills crap, i did once and was misserble it was an ellusion... Ther is no one to hold you wen you die, no one cares. Yes you have a wonderful God, but he isn;t wanting me. i need freedom i dont want to be held down anymore! i am being tornapart betewn people i love and people i want to be with that are shit heads, but i don't know what to do, the onse i love i hurt the onse who hurt me are who i hang with. i dont have any one to rely on or to charish, i had many but now have none. the dead are more likely to hold me in the night than any other. Rape is the only love making i have evr known, i dont know real love. i want to be love to every one. i want every one to be happy, well fed and warm, loved charrished. But that is nonsince ther is no such thing as love. i wish i were myself today, but i changge so much i dont know what that is anymore. i am like the wind, never the same each day nor hour. i am unseeable by my family i hurt and hurt others. why am i so fucked up? God if you are ther take me home and cleanmy herat of this crap within it! make me a better person! i beg you bless my mom and dad and get me out of their life so they can speak to one another again with out thinking of me. You made a mistake putting me w/them i love them but i hurt them so and dont even realize it till its done. i desserve nothing. i am nothing, and bless Sam, i love him so- but he desserves someone so special and bless him w/that when he is ready, and Ryan bless him and give him a loveing perfect woman of you god and give him children for him. I know  he would be a good dad. And bless my friends, please bless Brad, i know i screwed up w/him i did love hima lot. And help Daniel he is such a B.Ser but bless him. And bless my friends, and Jones, all the guys i screwed up w/ and girls and friends please forgive me. i am nothing. even if i never emont to anything multiply thier lives with love and pleasure everthing you will for them. And ash, God i need her so, i love her and i need her so bad... I need my sister so bad, she is the only one who understands me and i her. She has left to and i will leave but i must see ehr befor she goes to the army.. and carissa please bless her life i love her! She is so smart and knows me. God help me... I dont think i can do this much longer without you here with me, but i dont know how to live sinnlessly . Sometimes i just need a guy next to me, but i know thats not love but i sometimes just need someones arms to curl up into, so i feel loved or protected from what isee hear and think. I need someone, who will no tleave me, who will love em in the ways i needd it the most. Please, i have nothing to love anymore, No one - will love me becous i am only hurt. Sorry,  I will fly some day, i promise never to have a child or make another of  my selfish race, my blood stops here...

      I want to lie underneath this sky of burning flames. The winds are changing and the flowers are burning. The dry grass is screaming out your name, but i love the fire season. All must be destroyed and all must grow again. The old generations are dieing but the new are growing. The death creats a lifeless form that speaks its hope and future.  - Do i make this land burn with my anger or does is cous my anger to flare up with in my blood?

      My wings are shattered glass, my heart is broken but is being rebuilt... My wings are torn by your words of lust, once beautiful now they are blackened with hurt and memories. My mind is like and overload kilabite that has an deasie that eats all your info on the computer. My eyes don't know your face any more. You have been gone to long, i don't even rember the color of your eyes. I know your smell though, i know your voice, your fingers, i know your mouth, i know your heart. I know everything about you, but  i still don't understand your thoughts. I can't seem to grasp them in my hands. I can't hold your hand and seep through your skin and suck this info out of you.

      Breathing harder, ansd harder, Running agin, running again.... Where to my freind where to? His breath is crisp as the mornign air, his eyes fierce with tears and of burnign calves muscles drive deeper every step. His thoughts only on one focus, to drive harder and run faster... His mouth open only to gasp up loose air and blow it out again, his hair short and wet with swet. His shoes are getting damper by the pace, his veins screaming out with pleasureous evy to keep pushing twaords the goal line. The sun is climbing up his brow, the dribbles of salty air and water stream douwn his face. His eyes burn with hurt and pain but don't always show it. His arms long to hold his heart opened and to drink up its mercey. No mercey here, no mercey with in 60 days of pure hard labor , no mercey, him, he trains to bring mercey to his country not himself, he trains to bring faer into other countrys, but not him.  He is strong, in heart, mind, spirit and mostly soul.... His words arn't alwasy what he wants, but he says them anyways, his thoughts arnt alwasy what he says, but thinks them anyways. His heart isn't what most think it is, but it is anyways. He si a man, a man of his own heart, a man always running twaord something-  But where is he runnig?  He is running again, he is running straight for a battle not of flesh and blood, but of good vs. evil. A battle older than time itself, he is a warror, he was born to fight this war. He is a man of war, he will pick up his sword in honnor of his King, the Lord of the land, the Lord of his young but fierce haert. And he will go out fighting and willa ccomplesh a medle so much more than gold, women or goods of this earth, he will live for ever, and pick up his own crown. He is a King of his own age, and an King out of his time, not knowticed by all, but is anyways.  Even when he is not know as such, i will always know him as such, a man running after Gods own heart, again and again, and again.

      Your eyes melt my soul, this breath isn't mine, but yours. This crisp air from htis ocean breeze isn't mine, it is yours. You are gone, but when the wind blows i will always stand outside and let is blow my thoughts away, it is you. When it rains i will staned outside and be dripping with your tears. It will hide mine. Fate is not known by all whom fall for such troubled words. You are not here, but i feel you, i know your love. I have never been loved, but i know what it would be like, if i were to feel such a thing as love. I wish i could fly up to you, but i would only be pushed back doun to this muddied surface. I am not as you... Cylie-Cylie , come down to me, i need your touch, i miss your face. I yern for your wings to hold me, i am so saddened, they have cut my wings down, they have broken my spirit. I have no way to fly to where you are. My love, i never will see your face... I am nothing now, my wings are cut, my hair is frized with hurt. my mouth taste of bitterd ail, my toung is stiffende with rmorsful talk. My thoughts are dulledby lonenlness. My Arms feel no strenght for such a burnden of what you left on me. Cylie- why did you go away? O- Cylie, come back, come back, you are all i know, and all i have ever loved. Don't leave me alone in this cruel world.  Mus'nt we find a middle? Your and angel and i nothing more than a fallen angel- can we find a middle? Must we seperate from eachothers arms?  Enternaty is to long for such death to part my loveing words or my lover.  Your hailo has fallen to my grasp- my wings in your arms, your lips are now owned by mine. Your eyes are no more of burning ice- but as mine, of burning passion.  Strife- i hate myself... I love only you-  Our family lines are not good, but the children will be good but with eveil inside- what will they choose?

      I don't want to live with chnages on my wrist or a callor around my kneck... i don't want to ever hold back on my childrens dreams. I don't want to end up like any one i know. I want to be different. I don't know what i want. Freedom is the only way to love.

      I find my life swirling downward right at this moment. I wish i wasn't alone tonight, but as always i am. Alone, i hate- but its all i know.  I just need sleep. I just want to cut myself- but that doesn't do anything to help. Just leaves scars and memorys i don't want to remeber. If i rember how i did it though.  Just need to sleep- yeah just to sleep...  I hate sleeping at night hough. Worthless....  I live at night and am dead in the day. If i were a vamp- id be all ok...  You hav eno idea why i hate but love you all the same.  My mutiple personaltys- ha- i am sweet  one moment than a bitch the next... You never know what i will be next..  Who will you meet at my door...  I bite- I kiss, I love - I hate...  I kick poeples asses, then I help them get better after it.  I am so screwed up in my thinking sometimes.... But yeah i need to sleep, i need that more than any one or thing for all i  care i am alone anyways. Rather live my life in a dream with me tucked in  mans arms, that in real llife alone and always being in the way- of his plans. God-  why live if you can't the way you want to?  I don't know- all i know righ tnoqw is i feel like throwing up and biteing my rist till it bleeds. I yern to tast my blood, but i know not to anymore. I cant do it anymore- it is so easy though. so easy just to sit in the tub and slit your hand and watch the blod flow awy to ablivian... like my friends and life..  just blood.

      Today, during an boring lecture from my teacher in history; i wrote down every thing that ever stoud out to me that a guy has said to me...  Wheather funny, good, saddning, happi, or hurtfull all of it. I realized i have had many of the same sentances said by many diferetn young men, in many diferent ways. But yet all the same. What my conclution came to be is, we are all looking for secnificans, and love.  All my friends, ex-boy friends, were looking for exzactly what i was looking for. But how can two loe each other when they dn't even know they'r own self- or why they are on this earth.   What is our reasoning for being here? To wake up every day, smoke a joint go to school, kiss afew brake a few, go ot work - smoke some cigs, drink some at a party where your not having fun- wake up to a stranger and wonder how the hell did this happen? This is not our reasoning- this is not why we are here to wake up every day- but yet be asleep our whole life. Never waking up till we are face to face with Hell itself and its beholders- than do we relise what we were suppost to be?  About two months ago- i had an waking up nightmerro. the only thing was it wasn't just a dream.  I had finnaly done it- i took those little pills- they seemed to challanges me to swoolow them. i was so scared to do it- but what the hell- life sucked- i screwed up- Brad doesn't want me- Sam is to good for me- i just F'd up w/ Justin, and my parents deserve a better kid- someone they can trust... "God- you screwed up- and i am gonna fix it by giving my self to you and not waking up.!"  Well that is what i htought- but isn't really what happened... I don't remeber very much, just stbing I.Vs peircing my viens- digging in my thin skin trying to fing my shriviled blood. My heart was slowing- the nurses running- yet i can remeber one saying to another-"Why save someone when she doesn't even want to live? What a selfish bitch." All i could think of was calling Brad- He told me to promiss i'd never do it- agin - i promissed him- but what would he care?  So i closed my eyes and asked God to take me home, my stomech felt like a not inside my through burned like nothingid ever felt. I felt the clumps in my throught but nothing would come up- they had me on my back- i couldn't sit up it was choking me - i couldn't talk... My arm wouldn't move- my lips were numb- i couldn't think anymore- my face was hurtingfrom a reasont slap from my moms hand.  Than it came to me- falling into darkness- like that tunnol thing- light was comeing i was reaching out my hand but right then it was like a rubberband- it poped and i was flying backwards into nothiness. Loneleness- only hurt and pain. All i saw was what i did wrong- who id hurt- whod i lied to.  I was alone forever...  Then it flashe dover again and again like a movie i was in a cascet and was looking out up- saw every one i knew and poeple i didn't yet know my kids- or you know it wasn't really thier faces just thier presents. And they were dropping white Oleanders and Magnolia and white Cali lillies on me - i was creeming to them- "i am not dead- please help me i am not dead! i am not dead!" But they didn't here me they left and started throwing dirt on me- they went on w/thier lives and forgot about me... Like i had never exzistead. And i woke up in a childrens hostpital room. I guess that was the only room avalible for the night. I really didn't care either way. I was sore- my parents asleep on a small cot next to me- i didn't want to ghome and face my consiquices but i knew it was bettre than hell.  I don't know my pourpous or why the hell i am herer. I don't know why so many young men were torn from my life- but it is making me stronger and a better person.  Out of every guy i have "been with" (lack of better words) My favorite  has been Samuel, and Brad. First Brad- if you ever read this - wich i'm sure you aren't from what Daniel tells you i know you here nothingof how i really feel about you. You were an awsome friend- i am so glad i met you. You tought me a way of life that was so amazing and fufilling to my soul. Ilove you Brad Stock and am very proud of you for following your dreams. God bless. I pray some day i will get to be in eternaty with you in Hevean. Becous i don't want you to go where i visited. You deserve better Brad-.  And Samuel, God wher to star? Well if it wern't for you i wouldn't have fought so hard to live. You have said some really hard things to take but- have always made me think-.  I have never been a person to cry much- untill you broke me. I became human again. I htink i have cried with oand about you more than anyhting in my life. I believ you broke a dam in my emotions that spilled out all to gather- sorry). ;) But God- i love you to much- and i ma very proud and honnored to know you. You have the sweetess smile i've ever seen. it can melt my angeryess emotion. You are truly a wonderful friend to have.  I have no mor ewords to explain how you have been a help and how i feel about you.  Samuel Henderson, God bless i know i have a friend for life..  And Ryan! You were the only person that knew about and know about my whole life- and you've stuck around.. the thing i love about you is you are my brother and even if you liked me you would never take advantage of me. You are so sweet and always have the right words. You make me laugh when i feel like crying- you listen even when i raddle off- on some stupid shirt i saw at the stor. You allow me to be me- and not some one els. You like me for being bekah and not just another person. I am very proud of you- Ryan Berren, you are a truly awsome man of God.  You have a gorgous heart. Ilove you lots my buddy.   And Jones - i am finnaly over you- i miss your laugh, i wish you were better. But you have so much hurt. Just let it go- . I love you Jones Lee- and i will forever pray for you . and as long as i live in Boise i will go Vist your mothers grave. She is proud of you- but you must go on liveing - please get off the drugs- i really don't want to visit you in prison for sailling it anymore. Please don't do that. I hope that the Marines Seils are wher you'll finnaly find your slf. God i love you too.  Kim- you are awsome! You just say it like it is- i love you to death... Kim Forrey.  There are many more to talk about but i am so sore and out of thoghts right now- But- For all my freinds, boy-girls i love ya'll! God bless, thank you for being  part of my life.  Meg, josh,Ry-ry, Sam, Kim, Linsey , Erick D., Erick T., Tamar. KRISSY!, Misty, Charissa, Hannah , Carissa, ect...

      How do i talk to you tomorrow, without crying over this subject? I've never felt this way for anyone befor- and you expect me to be so meture? I am very strongh but i am also very vounerble to you.  I am vounerble to no one- but you. I felt happy for once- but i guess it wasn't truly happieness since you weren't. I tryed so so hard to do what was right- to please you, to make you stay- but you still went away. Maybe not from this world- or my Hometown- but my world- my heart- you left open and dirtied with tears...

      What happens whe you are so confused that you are confused, you become even more confused?  What happens when you are inlove?  What happens when you can't tell if you are anymore?  What if you are but you don't know it?    -And if you are, is it right? -Is it true love?  If love is good- than why doe sit hurt so much?  Why does it have to be acompinied by so much hurt and confustion?  God- i feel so alone right now... I think i love so many but i hurt so many. I love one- yet there si nothing in stake for me- there is another but i have no feeling but cpanionship with . Must i wait for something not there? Or go for something there- yet not  in me ? I love both- but what is just friendship and what isn't just friendship?

      Today was hard, like a load of bricks in my throught. everything with in me was holding down my emotions. I wanted to screem at you- but i also wanted to just hold you and tell you that everything was ok. I am so confused right now, but i am very clear within my mind. I wanted to hold your hand- but didn't want to be hurt again. I wanted to just go back to how it was befor nay of this.  Driving home- i listened to my song- the "evil one"  you call it... And i wished i could drive away and nver go home. It is so tempting to just drive- and not stop.  Driving you home i didn't want to take you home- i wanted to just keep driving and go into the sunset and dissapear, where life would be great and lovely.   To go and be free from this worlds veiws of life.  My mind is spinning around with questions but mostly yerning to make life hurry up so i can make since of it.  I thought i was over this- i am amaized  i didn't cry in your lap- i felt like it- but once again my emotions were held back by my stubberness and unwilling soul to submit to such girlesh emotions- such as crying .   I am once again strong- and so are you.  But tomorrow is YOUR new day- are you who you want to be?

      I know you must have become very lonely your thirty years on earth. Your father was the only one to love you back for who you really were and are still. His son, you must have been very longing for his arms to cradle you. I know this becous you wouldn't have put it inside us. Since we are made to love, feel and be in your image- you must yern and miss each and every one of us- your children.  I wish i could see you and hold your loveing hands tonight- and tell you everything i feel insied- good, bad everything. Even though you already know- you've known all along how i am , how i feel, you made me.  Though i've never seen you- i feel you... I want to be like the man Braddley talked about in a book he read. A man was walking and a kid waz following him, the man stopped in the middle of the road and then stood there for a moment; then kept walking. the kid ran up to the man , and asked-"why did you do that? Why did you stop in the middle of the road like thta?" The man replied-"Becous i lost Gods pressants for a moment , and need to find it again."  If i could walk by faith like that and stop when you said to and knew when i lost you- i would be an amzing person. But i do loos you- alot. I miss place you, take you for granted. But you keep on forgiving me.  Reasontly- my best friend, and i were talking about and hard subject, Why we broke up- and what were we going to do about it-. I asked soem really hard questions, And was trying to do everything to keep my stomech inside me. He looked at me with his beuatiful wide eyes and said , " I don't know why you don't just blow me off?."  I answered him and not really knowing what i was saying, and said- "And what good what that do?" "I'd just be alone agin." "Your the best thing thats ever happende to me- yes - i have been very hurt, and agry at you, but i -," He said quietly, looking down at his dirty baseball cap-"I'm sorry, for ever hurting you- i never meant to break it all off." "sometimes it is just easer to forgett about you then to acctrully call, as bad as that seems." I didn't really know what to say, " I had wanted just to lap him, but somehtinginside me felt sorry for him, i knew he was exzalste dfrom his endless day of marching in a black t-shirt at the base. But i wanted to bunddle him up in my pocket and keep himt her and never let him go. But he is so fradgle- i was afraid to say anything as if he would just go POOF, and dissapear from me again.  My friend, my good friend, you know my struggle, you made me who i am today, you've allowed my every mistake, my every victory, please bless me so i may bless others, keep me from evil and temptaion so that i may not be used for such or by such, please inlarg my tearitores so that i may lift it up to you and call you blessed one...  Thank you jesu for my every day life, thick N thin your always in my heart, Bless all my loved ones, and onse not yet to have been introduce . Good night,  Yours truly,        Rebekah Christy Hoffman

      Somethimes at night, i am so lonely- for you... To day i felt closer to you- yet so many things stand in the way. Comunein is my special moment with you-. I really try to block out Sean- and every one really. I miss you- mostly i miss seeing the results of being close to you.  I know you are here with me evry day and moment.-  Sometimes i still feel lonely- i don't understand why things are as they are. I feel rejectted so easly. I love you- and sometimes i am so angry at no one- i blame it on you.

       I am a randome person. I say the most randomess things, and do them too.  The most dessturbing thing is what random things happen to me. Like two summers ago day i was talking to a friend and  i meant to introduce him to a nother friend and instead of saying his name correctly- (Tyler Rietzt) I said this is Rylor Tiezt. Yeah that went over reall well...  Or Last year wheni was dateing this guy named Jones, i was introducing hi m to my FRiend Josh, and i forgot what Jones's name was.  Or a month or so ago, i was dancing with a friend named Daniel and he fliped me- this dance was suppost to be formal- right? Well i was the only formal gal- ther. I wore a pink dtwirly dress a,d was dumb fuonded to fing every one in jeans. But anyhwo daniel flipped me and my dress wnt over my head, he fel on top of me , then tryed to kiss me!   Two nights befor that! I was at a concert with him, and some of his pothead friends, and Boes cousin grabbed me half way through the concert, with Switchfoot singing "I dare you to move" i guess it impacted him to kiss me and stick his hands down to fare and toung. Tha freekd and pissed the hell out of me!  One time i was at the movies with Kim, he was kinda depressed, so after the flick, i opened a dorr for a lady and baby. (bad idea) i stood ther for like 5 minutes holding the door for every one and his brother. The I was walking twaord the cheep seat thearher exist, when Kim said "Why are we going this way?" I thought he said "Lets go this way!"  so went outsied- sure inough it was the back of the buildng. so we walked all th eway around, and i tripped over a speed bump, and then did it agin infront of a crowd while they were laugh aat me still- i countinoued to run face firts into a parked car.  These sorts of miss happs confront my pressent evry day.  I hit a bird today , then wheni went back to find it, while crying it flew away as if mocking me.  When driving with Sam, i act like a mainiac, i drive horrible with him in the car...  I get lost in my own neiborhood, but i have a photographic memry i've been told.  I sometimes run into things in day time.  I say stupid things to counselers.  I act imetue with guys.  I trip over my own feet....  Weird men flirt with me.  Old guys like to touch me? Sometimes i get whisles from other grils.  I had a girls kiss me in 5th grade. That was wierd....  I've seen my face in soem ones car- that i don't know. I've been randomly in the newpaper...      like this guy came up to me and said- "Do ya ever get the feeling every ones watchen ya?" I- well yeh i guess i replied. But what does tha have to do with anythang?  "Nothen at all"- - he responded nothen at all and walked away.  Of all the rondom things thta happesn to me. This is the wirdes- why would an old man come uo to you and ask "So do ya thiank it woo-od work?" I responded in criousedy while trying to feel my gas tank by Fred-myers in meridian- "Um- what -would work - Sir.?" " A windshile wiper on a ducks butt?" He said laughing- yet seriously- than walked off lauhging. Leaveing me very confused-. (YET THAT IS VERY EASY TO DO TO ME)  Why do those things happen to me?   Why is it me of all people?

      i pitty no one, for every mistake and bad habbit comes from that person.  I ptiiy no one, esspecially me, please pitty me not. To pitty oneself is to turn your back on God, and forget that he made you the way you are.  Be content with who and how you are, if you pitty your being than forget about thanking GOd for what he has doen for oyu.  Pitty nothing~ only the ones that don't know God.....

But you aren't your really there.  But not for long, and you will be gone, and i will never hear nor see you again.  I'm sorry for hurting you, so many times i tried to make it right, but that person you call your friend and whom i use to too, has poisened every friut i give you.  I feel stuped, but i love you, and i think of you offten. I wish you would read this and think and Know the truth.  Please remeber me, Brad

      I am not yours, nor anyones. I haven't belonged to anyone for a long long time. I iether want to belong to anyone. Even if i were loved by all, i would push all aside and away from me. I have no feelings of love tword anyone. I have no one to give them to. Love isn't a feeling, it isn't a peaceful trait. It is nothing more thna a piece of Hell to hold on to , to say yes- i love theee, yet run away with another in lust.  I have so many i love, but i have gone numb.

      You have some sort of hold on my thoughts. I try to forget you but when evr you cal or pay attention ot me, i am bounded by your lies. It has been almost 6 months since we first met. But still you hold me to my pats. I want to meet with you, but am afraid of what may be forced apoun me if i submit to meeting you. I yern to be your friend, i loe being in your company. You wer the only true one to understand what i have seen. But you used me so unhaertedly, i have no trust in you. You changed me, and confused me, into soemthing i was afraid to look at in the mirror. You took my hurting heart and chewed it up, only to spit it out in my hands, to let it rot in the darkness of your unwilling mind. You forgot about me, you ratheer smoke your pot and have sex with sluts, then love and take care of my needs.  i was to much to think about, i was sick and you through me out in the cold. I didn't have a place to go, and you shut the door in my face. But now you want to see me? And i yern to see you, you have a hold on me. It is like whatever you say i respond in compasson and willingness to please your mood. But inside you frighten me... You don't love me, you never did, but i still hold your thoughts. You suducted me into your web, and sliced my heart and purity away. You knew my weeknesses and you dwellew in them. I knew your motives but still i was courious. I knew you would hurt me, but still i wanted you to love me. I knew you'd bite me, with your poisen, but i yerned to feel it in my veins. You awoken my deathning spirit to race and fight for what i feared all my life. You awoken my lust for inpurity. My hearts crys for touch, my skin crawled when you were neer. I felt iw as getting raped each time, over and over again, but i wanted only love. I knew better, but why not go with this. It is all i desserve. I know you have a beautiful heart inside, i know how your mind works.I have read your thoughts.  And you mine. My herat belongs to another, but you are still my friend. I long for you to spend eternety with me, but not in Hell. I forgive you for all the hurt you coused me, i am sorry for all i coused you. But now i still don't understand my heart.

         Nothing i od is for ever, nothing you say even last a day. I have nothing. I feel you are nothign more then a coward that has no heart. You don't live for love, you have nothing to offer, I hate what you do tto me!  You will never feel my lips on you again. I will never say i love you again. You desserve nothing more than hurt like you have done to me.... God- you are so selfish!  I have been broken so much this year- just tell me what the Hell you want me to be. Why do you act so god!  Just go awya and be your little hero- i have had enogh hurt for one year. Just go away, go away and let me be.....  Go awya and stop hurting me, stop takeing peices of my heart. I love you and you spit it back in my face as if it wer funny.  Why? What did i do wrong?  Nothign last forever...

      Samuel Lee              Is leaving for Cali,  He is going to be a Sailor boy, a boy with no hair. His voice is changing to deepness, as if the ocean itself. His mind is always curious of what he could do behind the lines. His heart is precious it reflects his love for life, though it be hard at times, he always accomplishes his dreams. He strives for that attention form his father, which he will receive even if it is not in the military. His eyes make me melt, knowing that how special he is to me. He is the most precious thing his mother has. Men may be jealous of his strength- yet inside they yarn to be as he. He is in shape in his body glistens with accomplishments. However, inside he is a man of war. However, he has never fought with guns, or bullets- though fist he may have used and sharp words, his heart go through one ever day and night. Contemplating his thoughts of what is right and wrong. He is strong, he is weak, he is a man, and he is a warrior to me. Though he and I not to be, I still like to think that maybe someday it will truly be him, who I see down that aisle. However, life is strange, it does not do what you wish, it never makes since.    Like a twisty kid is squirms until free and runs away with your things.  Life hurts, love hurts, but to never have loved Mr. Sam; I would miss the most special part of my life yet to be. I still love what I have lost, maybe never to gain, but you never know until you let go to se if it swims back to you... However, in away I am not going to let go, but in way, I already have. God has a way of working things out as east west once said. He has got a reason and he do-en it. So go away and be your hero- but know I already thought you were one, just by living. You do not have to be macho, or wear a starched army suit, because I love you just as you are, in uniform or in a dirty smelly hat. Because you Samuel Lee Henderson, and there is not and will not ever be another Sam for me. I would die happy today knowing I had your heart for a day. Because you already have mine from the first day, I saw you.

        This morning is bright with my firey. This sunshine is my thoughts that run into my eyes. My heart si like the sky- open and very wide. But also blue inside. But this won't kill me... I live forever, in His arms of love. I find no  peace in htis world. I find nothing worth to hold onto, and when i od find soemthing or soemone i truly love. They are taken away. Why is this? But there is always tomorrow to try soemthign different. something new and pure. God, help me ot be wise, and hummble. You know the one i love the most in this world. I don't know what to do anymore. Did he do what was right? Am i wrong for how i feel? I don't know anymore, i just don't know... I love him so much i am going crazy inside. Bless my SAm- Your son. He's yours do with him as you wish. Thanks you for leting me get to have him in my life. I am so blessed to know such a wonderful young man. I am so unworthy.  I wish i were a better person , Please bless him today and this summer when he is away. Protect him God, and keeep him away from harm. I siriously don't have a clue what i would do if he was hurt. Amen.

      Sometimes i get so tierd of living in this place. I wan't to drive away, for ever... I rather not go home.  I am always alone. I am always getting hurt. I am so tired ogf it...  You don't care, you never did. You left me in a trash can. you drove away frome, wheni waz born. I will never know you, or ever see your face. I don't know you. I am a part of you, but i am never you. Why did you hate me so much, to levae me out in the cold? Why did you not love me? Why did you act as tho i waz a mistake. i will never understand why i was first rejected by my mother. I will never know why i am rejected.

      Tonight I have no clue what I want for my life. but hey that's ok, I know who I am and who I want to be! I am my own person- I need no one to tell me what they think of me- because it makes no difference... I am proud to be me in 2004 . I am a woman without any weakness, I am strong... I am a woman that is hurting every day.  But I have my sword and I will never love a another man again. I have hurt to much, I need no one. I am better off alone, I have friends that are men- but I will not share any thing as love with them.  Or intimate conversation, I have no trust in this saddened creation- so called a man's world. They are no better than I, an dif they hurt me so easily- I will bite back so fats. As if I were a snake- I will bite quickly with my poisonous venom, I will not allow another man to come into my heart and tare it out so sweetly.  I have loved to much, and been stabbed in the back to many times.  So I am not alone, I am a woman of many different disguises... So deal with it.

      Never again do i feel so stupid. Why do i put so much trust into people when i dont have any trust truly in them accompleshingh or keeping their words.   Once it is dead nothing will awaken it till it wants to be awaken.  I always feel alone and stupid, when i think i have a guys whole world in my pocket he breaks my heart saying "we werent to be". Or "it wasnt right for me". It seems ot me whatevr is right for the young man is always the worst thing for me, and the thing that kills me the most.  I am so tiard of this cicle, around and around i never stop twirling. I dont feel like hus=rting anymore...  I want to be loved, i want a man to realize how beautiful i can be, i want to think to myself thta i am worth to look at.  I just want a guy, a friend closer than a friend. I just need a friend, but i must be not worth the efort of Gods time to be given such a thing as a relible guy.  Nothing is worht His time - i guess

      My life has many turns and twist. I feel as though I am just a nether grain of sand, when I t comes to being thought of by another person. I often wonder if I ever do such to another? The one person I love the most, has hurt me a lot. He  hasn't meant to, but that's just life. Today- I saw a little boy, chubby cheeks, a cute little fishing hat. He was foal of mistakable! And reminded me of what you must have looked like as a child. You still have chubby cheeks! No, I love them though. Your sweet face, your nose. I miss your nose. Even thinking that maybe there is another for me, I can't stop contemplating your eyes, you voice and much much more of you. I miss you to much. But I don't think you shall ever call me again, you are to wondrous to stay put here with me. You can't, you have only freedom when away. Your freedom comes with the ocean, with the Marines, I know... I'll wait though, but ifning you ever cared. But that's just the way my life seems to play out as.

      I have a life of nothing but nothing is nothing and feel nothing more than stupid!  Good-God I  have nothing in common with this world. I have a life with less than what God has given me to work with... But the sun will shine tomorrow, and I will get out of my soft bed and smile ear to ear, and sing out and say  "Thank you God for this day!" I have nothing more to say to your lies an dill tempered scene's. You will not control me, I will over come this trial! I am a strong fighter, something you have never imagined in a woman. I will not go down with out a fight for my heart. I will fight till I am bleeding and still I will stand and Pearce your heart as you have down mine. For my heart will heal, yet yours will always be pierced with sorrow an pitty for your losses. You had something great, and you lost it on behalf of your stubbornness... I loved you, and I gave you up to this pleasures hurting heartacking fragment of a life. I still hurt for your touch, but I will not think of it, I will go on. And you will always have me in your memory... Do you not remember what I use to have in my palms? I played with the darkest of the dark, I i was powerful I still am. Yet I gave it all up to come into the light. I will never harm you as in the past heartbreaking, but know I have to power to ... But I wont, I will walk away from you and=d shake the dust off my feet, and say my goodbyes and forever pray for your broken heart. I love you yes- but I will not die a death that I do not deserve. I will not be shattered by your mean words that pierce my heart, I cried my last cry over you last night. I wont do it again, I will go on... Life will go on, life will go on- as Presley said... that's just life.

       Beyond what you call your home, your life, what you may have owned, or what you may own now; has no effect on where you will end up at the ending of your own life. Where will you be?  Who will remember you?  And what will you be remembered by? whether you be the star of your school, your job, your life, the best of your friends; this doesn't make you anything. As one of my favorite downgrading sayings is, - "You are unique, just like everyone else." This is what I live by, silly as it may seem, your life doesn't belong to you, you don't own anything you think you may own. All of life, and material items, don't really eczist. Now figur it out for your self, and fined your own ending. Make it good,  make it great,  make it worth Rembrandt,  and make it worth wild,  don't worry about being safe... (But that's just a theroery.)

      Nevertheless I have fallen in and out of love many times this past year. Funny I say this, because I don't think really nay of it was true love.  See the silliness of being a teen in this day and age. But however I am happy, I have experienced much this year. Good, and bad.     But truly what is love? Is it a kiss? Or a hug? A slap to reality? neither- but yes?   I have so many questions to ask- yet I don't think anyone knows the really true answer to that one...   "I say a lot nothings, but a lot of nothings, that someday may become a lot of somethings..."

      Mercy me, yet pitty the nothing less than hatetred or lustful prides.  God see's all yet i don't ever see him seeing it all- do you?  I am always alone, yet the funny thing is I live within crowds...  I find myself within your eyes, yet you are never looking ta me, always looking at another girl.  I am once again alone, wihtout warmth, becouse your arms are choking me with haet.  If love is so great, than why does is couse so much vilance within it?  If we ahve choices to control our lives, than why doe si t always seem to go the opposite way than what we would have rather it have gone?  If they say beauty is without a box, thna why must i always keep buying up boxes with beauty meterials to make me beautiful?  If art is not bounded by frames- thna why are there so many frames?  If yuo were to kiss me right now at htis very instant, would it mean you'd last forever?  If i were to slap every memory of saddness out of my mind- would i truly be happy?  If i were to tell you that i am fallen inlove with a stranger, would i be the stranger too?  Why are there so many lonely people, when there are so many people to get to know?  How many of the same faces to we pass each day, and do we say hi, or do they keep passing  by?  Does this make any since? Becouse it is really confusing me... But thta is very easy to do, since i get lost in parkinglots... I trip over speedbumps, i sing in the rain, and say injured animals. I talk to strangers, as if i know them. I wish i could have rithem like a raper, i try but it is always very sad. I wish i could slap all the pimps and make them trun into wardty toads. I wish i could make all the drugs dissapear, leagal and illeagal. I wish i could destroy mean people, and caresley destroy careless people. I wish i could relate to normal peple. But i odnt know what normal is.  sometiems i feel sorry for the rich person, and envy the begger. Someimes i wish that the ocena would swallow everyone up. Sometimes i wish i would be captured by another world. But mostly i wish to dessapear, to be invissable ot the naked eyes of this world. To slowly love and touch people while they sleep. To go to every beauty and give them dreams of wonder. to give hope for once, to destroy evil, as i was born to do. but without evil, there is no good. There is nothing. I have much on my mind tonight, i dont know what to do with it right now. Sometimes i want to meet soemone new, and drive away. i want to go soemwhere new, like a movie and when it ends wake up in a new story with a new face. Sometiems i dred wakeing, but then i miss someones face. bUt it is always changeing, they are always leaving, they are all different but all the same to me... i am looking for one person, but that person is in all of them, but it isnt them. I know what i want, i just have no clue what it is...  I have a beautiful mind to share with you, but i am afraid i dont have time to do it right now.

      My life is touched by many moments of passing years. I remiber so many things, good, and bad. I have never forgotten those meaningful words, thta once broguht me hope an dpleasure. but now i find none to comfort me, missing soembody so much i can hardly breath. I miss your voice, i miss yuor smell, i miss everything about you. I hardly know you, but inside i beleive i might. I dont know you, i wish i did, but life isnt alwasys about knowing, its about liveing and finally laying on a grassy floor thinking and figuring out what soemthing one day meant in that moment. But now in the present it doesnt make since, but in the future all comes to the glory of fugur oyu out sort of thing. To this day though, i cant quite figure out my lifes meaning, or why i am even here. Even wheni am gone i will still wnader why i feel inlove at 16, why i went through so much hurt, why my mother was sick the first 5 years of my life wheni needed her the most? Why i wnet with abusive boys who thought they were men, wheni had a loveing  father that never hurt me? Why i stuggled with drugs, when my father had tought me the rules since he was a drug counsler. I'd seen what it did to people. Why i felt so rejected when soemone did pick me out of the hostpital and brang me home, but still i didnt understand why anyone would throw me away like she did? Why did she want me now? Why does he look for me now? 16 years and now they want a relatioship with me? Thier daughter, that they never saw grow up... why does this still hurt me? Why do i feel rejected so much? why do i fall completly inlove with guys who give me the lest amount of attention? I dont knwo what love is- but i was raised with it, and how to use it. I have little glimpeseof happy moments, but i dare not shar them outloud- afraid thyed dissapera. Sometimes i'd like to dissapear- just go away. But i dont know where id go. What could be worse than this life? and what could be better? i dont  know, i dont really care anymore, i just am liveing my life for everyone to elses enjoyment. I think not of myself as much as i did, but i still feel lonely with inside my soul,. I have God, but that is nt all feeling as everyone says it is. I still need a mans touch to be fole, but now is not my time ot think of such. I cant i get depressed if i think about what i dont have, instead of what i have had with men, the good times. The laughs, jokes, funny things we did or said. I miss evryone, i miss the good times. I wish soemone would tell me if i am crazy or boring to read from...

      A long time is not so long ago, but i still see myself o- so much older than what i truly am. I still feel young at times though, never to underestamet age for fact. It lies  to us all, for ones skin of wrinkles has nothing to do with his age, or metuity- but his haert . How much it ages, how your mind falls into darkningness when it see such horros of this land, this place we call earth. I would like to fly to another planet, to see the stars up close, to touch another worldly soil. But it is so much a waist of space for nothing to exist out there- in what we humans call "Outer Space". I may be crazy, infact i think we all are, but that is what make sus so uniuq- but the same. Nothing has chainged under this old tired sun, nothing- just all we call change and improvements. Technology, the worlds resorce, have we forgotten of how our fathers survived with only knives and teeth?  What good has coem from our new creations? But what evil also has come  forth from our oun hands? Does this not frightne us? We soon will take up barcodes for our own safety, we will be forced to have digits that change and that the Goverment will have all knowing powers of your where abouts. It is dawn to happen, and soon. They watch us while we sleep, while we eat, we have no privessy, we must revive our spirits. Though this world be submissive under this mutiny of my freedom, i will nevr giev in, eevn if i must burn fo rit. To take these marks, to place these chips in my skin would cause me to loose my soul. and burn forever in Hell. I have nothing to loose but everythign to fight for, i may be a woman but i have the will power to fight for what is rightfully mine, freedoem doesnt coem from birth it comes from a sword at anothers throat. i will never serrender to any  Goverment - i will be this generations revelution- i will be  their  worst night mirror...  I serender to no one, but my God- and my faith,   I fera nothing- i laugh at the face of death- i plaid with it as a child- i've seen demons- and angels- i have seen the dead- i have seen much from a young age- but i am not afraid. I have seen Hell and i am not going back-  I hold powers that no one knows, i choose not to use my evil, i choose to live for good- for my God, and he shall always strengthan me...  So are you wiht me? Or do you choose the doorless death of lonelyness? Or eternal life?

      Today i woke up wandering where my old body of stae and mind had ran off too. i have not the same feelings for one, that i have now for another. I fall so easily, yet this time i waited, i waited. I had nothing to show forth yet fear of being scorned again. i had nothing but fear of what was unknown, yet unto my heart that what was already known.  Fear is a powerful thing isn't it? Anyone may control soem powerful man by a little pinpoint called fear. The unkown is my weekness. yet i do know much, i fear being loved again. Atlease being told thta sthat someone loves me. I have been told soem of this by soem men, who thought thye either loved me, or they might be able to have soem of me if saying such hurtfull words. Love has much power, though fear has always followed it for me. I dont fear much, yet i fear being left. i have been let down may many times, but this is not why i fear this love. I have never been actrully loved wihtout soemwhat of a physical attraction of my body. If not my body than what am i worht?  YEt i never thought i have been much to look at, though many have told me i am beautiful, i fera to beleive beautyy is whats inside. My Grandmother always said, " Beauty is what Beauty does." an dfi believ she was right and still is. But i have nothign really to fera i can reject just as well, but i fera if were to i would loose the thrill the light for my life. if thta makes any since. I am still always thinking of my past lovers as i refer to them in a nicer words than what i truly would rether say. But truly i loved them all in one way or another. But whaether they ever loved me is a question that shall ponder in my mind for a while longer in this darkened room in my mind. This corner to rest the notty child in, and i will forget what they said. I have someone in my heart, i belive i have soemone in my heart. I believ this is the one. bUt i am so afraid to make any move for it could vanish so quikly without a trace. I have so many fears yet i love so many of what i fear to be love. LOve is sweet- but it is scary as Hell.

      I am overwhalmed by this wierd love i am being shown by a young man. I have never felt this befor, he has known me for a year, and let me date other young men, and has been there when i was hurt by guys. He was there when i was in the Hostpital, he has been there for me and is relyable wich i have never expereanced befor now. He has told me his feelings for me only a few weeks ago, not evn that long ago. I to have deep feelings as well. Yet he has never tried  to hold my hnad- to kiss me or even hold me. He huggs me when i leave and that is all. I know it sounds different, and not many girls would enjoy this kind of relationship- yet i thrive in it. I have never felt more respected in my life, or loved, as a freind, and more... I am amaized of what he goes through with my family and he is still there. I am only a 16 year old girl, and he is only a 23 year old man, yet he treats me as if i were equel to his age. Most teenagers would think - "Wow! he can buy me buzes and smokes." BUt that doesnt matter to me, at all. He is so very pure, he is amaizing, it is hard not to spend hours focussed on just his face, the curve of his mouth when he is thinking of doing something, thta he knows he might get a kick or punch from me later. Or the scar over his left eye, yet i am still always wondering what the heck he is still wanting to be my friend? I am still mind bougled by htis question, "Why is he hanging out with me? "  " am just a stupid girl." But he seems to think differently about me. I have never had complements from a guy without them being sexual, or asking for soemthing. He has never touched me, or even tried too. He haas nevr even kissed a girl befor, and i have been kissed by so many imeture boys it  makes me sick and want to cry. When i was with so many stupid boys, he was waiting for me, and i had no earthly clue of this. I waiseted so many "I love yous" and kisses, parts of my heart that was not meant to be given away to them.  i dont know where this will go, but i am so amiazed wiht this man, i wouldn't think twice to merry him when i graduate. that is how much he has shown me his love, and i don't know the future, no one does- yet if there is one for me and him, it will end in marrieg i am quite sure, and if this is so. I will be the happest woman on the face of the earth...

      "When I wake In the mid morning, I listen to your distant calming voice  From the past evening, Encouraging  Me to dance away all my fears  To stay near Gods mercy Nevertheless,  I always come back to this,  You are still here when I awake,  You are still a phone call away, I know you will let me down and I will most definitely let you down, Nevertheless,  Today I think of only you.  ~O~ How God has overly blessed me with your friendship, Even when I do not deserve such, You may never know, how much you bless me, Even when you say not a word.” 			 			Rebekah C. Hoffman                                        June 21, 2004 				Dedicated to Ryan

      I am of a pure blood. I am of a pure and uniuq geen pool. I have eyes that are blue, and skin thta is goldne from the sun. I have strong but sleek muscles. I have long golden hair, that turns red in the sun. My leps are soft, my skin bare. My lashes long and black. My nose a perfect cut and sprinkled with freckles. My heart is made of dirt though. My lungs made of sinful desires to die. My arms wish to be wings. My eyes wish to see through these closed doors and clothes. My heart is gone, my face is stone. My hands ake to touch your skin. My mouth is dryer than the desserts plans on a hot summers days. One drop of tears from one eye makes the rivers travel down till everyone will die and gulp up the suficating air. Die die away, away you will go away i will luagh as you gasp and pant for help. i love no one, i worship no one , i need no one. I bow to nothinhg i have nothing... I am made of stone, once an angel of song but now i crawl like a beast in the fires of your lust to do wrong. I yern to touch you from inside to turn you inside out. I yern to derstroy all and be worshiped. I yern to sing again... My once beauty was rae now my wings are fraide and bint. I will never die, yet i have never truly lived ...

      I have felt like bursting into tears all day today. I hate this feeling, it is like i have no self esteem what so ever, when ususlaly i am ok wiht myself. Yet i act so strong i am very week inside. I am ashamed of myself and am always afraid of loosing you. Ryan, i know you will not leave me, i know you are sincear but look at the guys that have said to me " I will never leave you." And now where are htey? And do thye even remeber my name? You have been my best frined, you loved me when i was at my worst. When i went through rtarded boyfriends that hurt me you waited for me, you were pationt... Now i found myself only wanting you, even when i was with other guys i was thinking of you. I never really wanted to be with Brad, i just never htought youd likd me, and i - you deserve so much more than me. I loved you from the first moment i saw your pretty eyes, my herat lept. You looked at me when comeing from Joshes room and i almost forgot my name i thought you were so lovely. But not becouse of your gourgous featers, something else drew me to you. i am still trying to figure it out, but i love how you are such a mystery to this day. You have never yelled at me, never used harsh words tword me, even when you liked me and i was with Sam who was hurting me. You tryed to help us work things out and get back togather when yo uloved me so much you were willing to let Sam have me... You wanted me to be happy, but insied i dearly love sam, i do, but i wanted you. I dont know how Poor Sam will take this, i am so sad to say to him, i fell inlove. I love him still but it is different. I am sorry Sam you are still so young. Ryan you said you want to waite for me. You 23 i 16 how is this worht waiting for? I would marry you in a moment if i could but i guess we will just have to let time tell and put God first. i love hwo you love my mom and dad, you are a peace maker.i a fighter. you stop traffic for a goose becouse i thought it was injere3d when it was just stupid enough to walk in the middle of a busy roed. but you did it for me even without asking you walkeed wiht me . i am an animal nut and you love that about me, i bup and you luagh, i cry and you wipe my tears off my nose with your shirt, you have always hugged me even when i baerly knew you. You held my hand after you just couldnt stand not to any more. You submitted to my fathers wishes and you stayed with me. i dont understand why you do this. i am not that special, there are so many pretter smarter better girls out there- but you have chosen me for some odd reason. I tryed to play like i didnt love you but the truth is i am over bubling with love for you, and i cant explain it. i am so strong i want to go dancing in the rain and cry ou tto God and tell how greta he is. You are so inlove with him it makes my heart so joyfull... i want whats best for you though what God wants . But i am so blessed, you are so un perfect and i love you for that, wheni am feeling bad for myself you tell me how every one in the world has farted and i know no one else would understand but i love you for that. or how you have a squirt gun under your seat and how you just want to be near me or how you touched elbos with me to let me know your thinking of me when we werent suppost to hold hands. i love how you let me paeirce your ear and i love your crooked teeth and how you  God i love you... i dotn know hwo else to explain it... But that i am falling inlove wiht you...

      When morning comes and all is good, all has been shown by the sun, i realise it is Gods light becomeing ever so clear to me, i am very unworthy of this life, yet i am happy and full of joy for the first time in years, i have been given soemthing so very presous, i dont desurve, yet it is still here infront of my grasp, but&nbsp; if i take it by the hand all to quickly it might vanish an di would once again be left alone, it is not the right timeing yet i wish for it tobe , soon enoguh though, soon i will have the couraged and the strength and the allie of tiem for me to grasp my fingers in its fingers and be united as one body, but not yet, i must be pastiont and wait, i am in waiting for soem years, but these shall pass to so quickly , as if i were closeing my eyes for soem minutes and opening them to a toattly new world, i am as a inpassiant child though, jumping up and down befor the day that i can open a presant, trying to see over my parents shelf in th e closet where i know my gifts lay in slumber, till that early morning ui will taer the red and green papaer off of it, and be happy for so long, yet i will not forget about my gift as a child does with his or her chrismas presant afyter a few months or even weeks of playing with, it shall be like a stuffed animal to an onlychild who holds on to it for comfort and sheltee love when they feel as thoguh they are alone, if you don't understand qwhat i talk of, than this is very sad, yet you will figure it out sooner or later, you were born to figure this out, this riddle, follow the certant trail, you were destyned to look for it, your not suppost to be in bondage anymore, you were born alonen yet with other lonenly people, you walk in the same crouds every day beut you never talk to any of them except "Excuse me" or "Hold the dorr",&nbsp; what is wrong with this, why have we becoem numb, why ar ewe slowly dying so fast, can you just stop tio acctrully think, take a hand, fall inlove, with life, poeple, God?
