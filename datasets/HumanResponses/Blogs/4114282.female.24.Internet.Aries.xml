       I just found it quite funny (except the kittens part :P)    NICKNAMES - If Laura, Emma, Kate and Sarah go out for lunch, they will call each other Laura, Emma, Kate and Sarah. If Mike, Charlie, Dave and John go out, they will affectionately refer to each other as Fat Boy, Godzilla, Sh*t-Head and Four-eyes.   EATING OUT - When the bill arrives, Mike, Charlie, Dave and John will each throw in £20, even though it's only for £32.50. None of them will have anything smaller and none will actually admit they want change back. When the girls get their bill, out come the pocket calculators.   MONEY - A man will pay £2 for a £1 item he needs. A woman will pay £1 for a £2 item that she doesn't need but it's on sale   BATHROOMS - A man has six items in his bathroom: toothbrush and toothpaste, shaving cream, razor, a bar of soap, and a towel from M&amp;S. The average number of items in the typical woman's bathroom is 337. A man would not be able to identify more than 20 of these items.   ARGUMENTS - A woman has the last word in any argument. Anything a man says after that is the beginning of a new argument.   CATS - Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women aren't looking, men kick cats.   FUTURE - A woman worries about the future until she gets a husband. A man never worries about the future until he gets a wife.   SUCCESS - A successful man is one who makes more money than his wife can spend. A successful woman is one who can find such a man.   MARRIAGE - A woman marries a man expecting he will change, but he doesn't. A man marries a woman expecting that she won't change, but she does.   DRESSING UP - A woman will dress up to go shopping, water the plants, empty the bins, answer the phone, read a book, and get the post. A man will dress up for weddings and funerals.   OFFSPRING - Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist appointments and romances, best friends, favourite foods, secret fears and hopes and dreams. A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.   THOUGHT FOR THE DAY - What a woman says: C'mon...This place is a mess. You and I need to clean. Your trousers are on the floor and you'll have no clothes if we don't do the laundry now. What a man hears: C'MON ... blah, blah, blah YOU AND I blah, blah, blah, blah, blah ON THE FLOOR blah, blah, blah, NO CLOTHES blah, blah, blah, blah, NOW   Thanks Hyper! :)

       I have been always fond of my Windows 2000 and didn't really feel like moving to Windows XP. But I got it at work a few weeks ago and it has surprised me. Nice, stable (*touching wood*) and fast.  I'm giving it now a try at home, just reinstalled my PC. Took longer to transfer all my files than to format and reinstall, heh. Should clean more often :P

       I've tried like, thousands of times (ok, maybe not that much :P) to make myself a website. But I never succeed. I'm a lazy perfectionist. I want a perfect looking website with the less possible effort. Which in the end is quite hard.  So I've finally decided to create a blog in here. Looks nice so far, I hope I can reduce my lazyness and make it a bit more comfortable with time.  Welcome to my weblog!

       :: Mood today:  fine     She's got a smile that it seems to me Reminds me of childhood memories  Where everything  Was as fresh as the bright blue sky  Now and then when I see her face  She takes me away to that special place And if I stared too long  I'd probably break down and cry    urlLink Guns'n'Roses  - Sweet child of mine   Oldie, but besides nice lyrics and Axel's voice, this song has one of my favorite guitar solos -if not the most. Good to end the day with a smile :)

       :: Mood today:  rawr   I guess I should try to start with a happy or optimistic song, but don't really feel like it. There are so many things that annoy me about people... This could really be dedicated to some of them:   The only thing I ever wanted, the only thing I ever needed is my own way - I gotta have it all I don't want your opinion, I don't need your ideas stay the f*ck out of my face, stay away from me I am my own god - I do as I please.   urlLink Pain  - Shut your mouth   P.S. And don't worry, I'm not that mean usually ;)
