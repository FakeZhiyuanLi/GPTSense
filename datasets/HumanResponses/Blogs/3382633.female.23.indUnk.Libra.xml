      So I have officially vomited directly on the one who loves me. That's right-the wedding is off and I feel like Mount Kilimanjaro has been lifted off my 50 kg body. I had every response from 'I knew it would be too much for you' to 'What am I going to do for my vacation now?'. I can't totally say that my mind is eased because now I face the .... MIDGET DILEMMA!!!!!!!!!! I know what you're thinking- There should never be any dilemma with a midget...just pick them up, put them in your pocket and run them through the wash with your jeans . I know it seems only logical but what if you pine the little bugger? What if a stone washed midget isn't what you crave? What if a dark denimed intelligent, hilarious, artistic, sarcastic, stinky, skinny, little nail painter's got you so tongue tied you can't keep your mind off him long enough to use that ceiling mirror in your bedroom? Is reality escaping me? Have I been reading too much Tom Robbins and am loosing all sense of my life in the  Colombie-Britanique . Pretty soon I'll be riding down Highway 10 in my giant roast turkey with a can of pork n' beans and a dirty sock. I love my life in many ways and I love my Jebus worshiping ways and my fatty-hating mind, but when it comes to this I am a complete retard. Alright...so he's not a midget, but a man of normal stature. He's my symbolic midget. I need to take a week out of my life to prove one of two things: twitter twitter or twitter flop. Damn the laws of time and space!!!!

          So I believe this blog is missing something.  Yah, that's right!  You've been waiting for it. You've been on the edge of your seat hoping for it.  And I know you've even turned your face upward and prayed for it.  It's a ghetto blog!  You think Compton is bad?  Philly?  Pffffff!  You have never seen a ghetto as bad and rough as the Surrey ghetto.  Let me set the mood:      As you drive down a large highway street, you begin to look around.  It looks innocent enough.  A couple of night clubs, some fast food chains and several trailer parks.  Suddenly you see a large slow moving human crossing the road and realize in terror that you have spoted a gunt.  A gunt in all her glory.  High waisted shiny black spandex cling to every body part (she has three of most).  A large Hawaiian print dress (commonly called a moo-moo) drapes her blown up body.  Flat, extra wide brown sandals adorn her feet as she drags her obese body to the Burger King across the road.  You stare in terror, not being able to take your eyes off her.  As she surprisingly shrinks away with distance, you move on.  The trailer parks catch your eye.  Why is it that they are all so far removed from the road?  As you squint to see back into one, you catch glimpse of at least 5 more gunts and then you know.  It's safer for society this way.  Zipping past a couple gas stations, a few houses appear on the left.  One boasts a sign that says: 'No Hookers!'.  You need a sign and a rifle to keep them a way in this neighbourhood.  As you move down the road you see a woman in black tights, runs all through it, small shorts over top, purple high heels with way too many scuff marks and a tiny black crop top.  It's raining but she doesn't seem to mind as she smokes with one hand and looks for a ride with the other.  Her face is much like her shoes, way too many scuff marks.  Her arms are much like her tights, track marks running all up them.  As you look ahead you see 1, 2, 3, 4 more in the next few blocks.  You see a few teenage boys throwing pennies at one.  This may seem cruel but it is a common tradition in 'the hood' and is of utmost importance to maintain for future generations.  It is a low cost way to keep children out of trouble.  As you get closer and closer to the core of this bustling ghetto you notice more and more strip clubs.  The Pink Flamingo sounds like a classy place, with it's neon sign that says 'Fl__ingo'.  Harleys with giant, leather clad people standing on them.  And then there's the men!  You pass a large grassy area where a man seems to be starting to trim the grass.  A short dirty man with a flannel coat on and a tall bony woman with almost nothing on, bounce out of the grass and start yelling at the man.  Where will they have sex now?  Stupid man with a weed trimmer.  Don't you know overgrown grassy areas belong to pimps and hookers?  People throw small bags out of apartment windows as other people below throw rolls of money upward.  Children with no shoes play 'crack house'.  A man walks with a plastic bag on his head to protect him from the rain.  Doesn't anybody red the warnings on plastic bags? 'Keep out of reach of children and anybody under the influence of drugs or alcohol'.  Shopping carts lay parked at corners, piled with treasures like bottles and blankets.  Now is when you realize that you have made it to the Surrey ghetto.  This is where I live.  Yesterday a man with a shopping cart was passing my house as I was leaving to start my laundry and he turned to stare at me.  He knew who I was.  He knew I was the one stealing bums for my basement bum collection down stairs.  He knew, but he was afraid! What you don't understand is that the only way to survive out here is to form a team of bum mignions to protect you.  In return for this favour I give them the occasional meal and a whole lot of porn.  You can judge me but you will never understand the pressures put on a sane, non-drug using woman who lives every day in fear of gunts, cunts, and crack-head stunts.  Today's Meals: breakfast shake, salad with feta, tomatoe and flax, low-cal italien dressing, orange, dried fruit snack, 1 cup vegetable soup, granola bar, scrambled eggs (2 eggs, one yoke), 6 pieces melba toast, broccoli, carrots, apricot  Today's Activity: 5 minute warm up on treadmill, 20 minute elliptical trainer, upper body strength training, 25 minute pilates abs conditioning workout

      Big B emailed me this morning with this alarming message:   I suspect that I my have crossed some sort of imaginary line. [hair line ?]. They have been watching me. This morning when I went out to get my morning paper, the signs were everywhere. Empty KRISPY CREME BOXES, McDONALDS WRAPPERS,you name it, a fucking wrapper from every gunt packing feeding hole around.[ God I'm afraid].They known, those scaring fucking freaks know. I also found a  piece of some sort of cheap cotton material with a Hawaiian print on it! The damn thing was stuck on the razor wire on my fence in the front yard.We all know this material is used for only one thing" MOO-MOO'S"!!!! They are here!!!! I know it! Yet strangely, after been abstinent from alcohol for fifteen years ,I am feeling a strong yearning for a double rum and coke. No fuck that! A bottle of Jack straight up! I have to go! Darcy is still sleeping but I must force myself to crawl upon her scrawny little body and fornicate fiercely like an angry monkey. It is my only redemption. God! I hope this works ,I may be slipping. I'll have to ride this skinny bitch (in a good way) until I purge myself of this depraved and despicable  desire for the dreaded gunt. I have to go! And I mean now.Damn this cell memory!.   Darceeeeeeeeeeeeeee     PS PS PS Keep an eye on your man's alcohol consumption.   So the message is clear.  Watch out for signs of gunts in your neighbourhood.  Other signs may be large brown patches on your lawn, birds and small creatures scurrying away in fear, and a shortage of hard alcohol at nearby liquor stores.    Yesterday's Meals: whole wheat bagel with jam and peanut butter, plum, orange, granola bar, dried fruit snack,  party food- crackers & cheese, bean salad, cheese bun (mistakenly picked it up and then had to eat it), fruit, veggies, two bites of carrot cake , zucchini pasta, broccoli, carrot, popcorn  Today's Meals: whole wheat bagel with pb& j, plum, veggie dog, orange, 2 dried fruit snacks, 2 snackwell cookies, mixed greens salad with flax, feta, soy nuts and tomatoe, low-cal italian dressing, about 10 vegetable crisps  Today's Activity: 20 minutes basketball with HTB, 40 minute brisk walk with 3 lbs. weights (some intense incline) with HTB, cleaning (great for upper body)

      A few months ago I was so motivated to loose a few pounds before my wedding in September, that I printed pictures of bikini models and plastered them all over my kitchen.  I even kept a few pictures in my purse for a quick refresher.  I dubbed this plan the 'Bikini Motivation Diet'.  I told you I was sick!  Every day I would stare at those 'ruler' body types and think 'walk away from the fridge and you can look like her', 'run a little harder and you can look like her', 'all I need is love and a bony figure and I'll be happy'.  It wasn't until I read this wonderful article a couple of days ago that I decided to tear them down and start looking at my own body for motivation.  People would die to have my body.  I'm serious!  You would probably kill me yourself if you could. The other day at work we had a casual staff in and I would guess her weight at about 100 lbs max. at 5'5".  I noticed that while she sat she had a little 'over-the-jean' roll hanging out.  My inner bitch screamed for joy as I realized that even asparagus-sized girls have rolls.  Today's Meals: Breakfast shake, Bean salad, 4 pieces of whole wheat Melba toast, plum, granola bar, 2 1/2 tofu fahitas  Today's Activity: 30 minutes on automatic treadmill with 2 lbs. weights, upper body strength training, 20 minutes eliptical training no resistance  BTW: I read this article about my body type which turned out to be a spoon.  Ya I hold everything, muscle and fat, on the bottom.  They suggest limiting any resistance training on the bottom to avoid bulking up.  So I will be avoiding resistance in my lower body.  Anyways, despite the fact that I think it's the wrong way to get motivated for a healthy lifestyle, I think I could really market this Bikini Motivation Diet.  Girls everywhere of all ages staring at overly think woman of unnatural proportions, doubting their own beauty to thinness?  What?  Oh yah!  They've already named that diet: Media.

      This is treat!  A blog-worthy email from my equally sarcastic and people hating friend, Big B.   Didn't want to say anything, but there is a condition that is altered by alcohol, but upon sobering   up  it   becomes the most horrifying sight to any man alive. It can turn the hardest of erections into a quivering mass of wrinkly jello.This affliction is known by some, feared by all.It is the drinking man's most hellish of nightmares.The thought of waking up to ********GUNT!!!!!!  Only the drinking man can be deceived, easily disguised by a moo-moo or the ever big sweater and spandex stirrup pants.There is an old biker's tale that it has been known to turn the burliest of bikers into chronic monkey spankers. For the fear of another run-in with the GUNT is far too much to risk exposure again.All this will be denied by all  men.  This is a secret tip from one friend to another.   I personally have experienced it.It turned me celibate for two years and now a tea toddler. I am safe with Darcy Arnold Arms because I know that GUNT will never rear it's ugly self in my home.  Darcy Arnold Arms will deny all knowledge of GUNT in front of woman. There are a few freaks of nature that prefer gunt but is it the alcohol or is it a genetic defect? You have been warned.  Oh yeah, GUNT suffocation can be a very serious issue for men of smaller stature or bigger alcohol consumption. -  Big B.

      If you have read any of my other blogs you may have deduced that I am that girl that makes every other girl look like an angel.  Keep in mind that these blogs are the inner most thoughts of my mind and not ALL of them spew forth from my mouth during the course of a day.  I AM grossed out by fat people.  I HATE people who hum or whistle.  Are they seriously THAT happy that they have to annoy me?  At any given time during my day I may be thinking:  You are SO stupid! - SHUT UP! Shut up, shut up, shut up! - Ya, you're fat, unhealthy and eating french fires.  Good for you, you deserve it! - If I just walk away right now would they notice? - I'de rather be shaving my cat's ass right now than have to pretend I care anymore! Some people may have no idea that I'm thinking these things but the ones who truly know me, and who I allow to get close, are usually the type who are thinking the same things.  Of course, despite the fact that I strongly dislike most people, the few I care for are dear to my heart.  Because with them I can say the words fattie, bitch, stupid, ignorant, selfish and even cunt!  Anyways, what is a bitch?  Over the past few years I have redefined what the word bitch denotes to me.  Here is my definition:  Bitch= A self assured, independant woman who knows what she wants and says so.  A person who accepts the dark side of humanity as inate.  A woman who does not feel the need to please others simply to maintain a certain 'nice' appeal.  A person who is only fake when it is absolutely necessary and never stands down out of convenience.  An intelligent, introspective and reflective person who does not turn away 'difficult' situations.  Somewhere along the line we defined a bitch as a selfish and insecure person who felt better when others were down.  I want to change that.  I AM A BITCH! Support the bitch movement- do your part!!  Today's Meals: bagel with light (meaning only a little) cream cheese,  bought-salad with half egg, tomatoe and cucumber, italien dressing, 1 plum, white bun , 2 veggie dogs in white bun (they don't sell brown hot dog buns, grrrr), broccoli, carrot, 1 reduced fat graham cracker  By the way:  About 2 weeks ago I stopped using margarine on my steamed vegetables and simple leave some water on them and add a little salt.  I find it isn't that far off from the taste of margarine.  Still lots of sodium but at least no hydrogenated stuff or trans fats.  Yesterday's Meals: breakfast shake, 4 timbits (practicum student brought them in to work as a thank you on her last day), bean salad, broccoli, cauliflower, white pasta with feta and tomatoe, broccoli, cauliflower, green beans

      I admit it.  I have a problem.  Ok I have lots but I'm only talking about this one in particular at the moment.  My name is Venus and I am a scale whore.  It's difficult to say but it's true.  I am a scale whore.  Everyday I make any excuse to visit the washroom just so I can ease my filthy cravings.  I stand on that scale and feel a release as I see those red digital number flash as they settle on one number.  ahhh...  I do it first thing in the morning.  That's the best time cause the number is so little.  And then I do it after breakfast, before and after showers and even in the middle of the night when I'm up for a pee.  This habit isn't even contained to home.  I do it in washrooms every where.  At my friends houses, my HTB's parents house and even at work. (sobbing dramatically)  I'M A SCALE WHORE!  There are no support groups for people like me, only people pounding on the washroom door saying 'what are you doing in there' as I frantically wait for those numbers to decide.  What will it be today?  120...121...119..118 or that beautiful morning number...117.  I know I have a problem.   This blog is exactly what I needed.  This way I don't become one of those annoying people who go around all day talking about how fat they are, how they need to loose weight, what they eat, what they do at the gym.  I was recently out with somebody who does this.  She's the big girl who constantly makes mention of how thin you are and how fat she is.  She was trying to get through a narrow space as another teenage girl was waiting.  She said to the stranger waiting 'oh you'll have no problem getting through here'.  How do you expect people to react to that?  How do you expect people to see your good qualities when all you keep doing is flashing the bad ones around on a neon sign?  THUNDER THIGHS RIGHT HERE GET YOUR LARD ASS WHO WANTS TINY TITS? (that's another story for another blog) HAIRY ASS ANYBODY? I HAVE A PIMPLY BACK...WANNA MASSAGE IT? LIKE BUMS?  I GOT SIX! I HAVE A SMALL,  UNDEVELOPED PART OF THE MALE ANATOMY          DOWN BELOW...WANNA SEE?  I mean that's just not how you get respect from people.  I may sound like I'm neurotic, lacking self esteem and completly insane...well that may be the case but I don't go around telling strangers that I have a hideous double bum under these sexy jeans.  I save that for my private blogging.  Besides, my HTB loves both my bums.  In fact he thinks I'm just about perfect and I think he's right.  Now, how do I convince my subconscious of that?   Today's Meals: Breakfast shake, 6 perogies with fat free sour cream, soy chips, 1 slice blackberry pie, sandwich, cauliflower, corn on the cob, broccoli  Today's Activity: 30 minutes on eliptical trainer, 5 minute cool down on treadmill, upper body strength training, 25 minute pilates abs conditioning

      I have two loyal fans.  One of my best friends, Darcy Arnold Arms and her husband Big Toys B.  Big B ,as I will refer to him, wants to know: Do you whistle once or twice for a girl with a double butt, and would the saying then be "nice asses"? Which butt does one grab? Or does any of this matter in the world of Double butt?   With a single butt a man takes a "double take"How many takes does a man take with a double butt?  Well I will answer these questions for your inquisitive minds:  I beleive the appropriate etiquette is one whistle for every butt.  This goes for the 'double take' as well.  One double take for a simple single, triple take for a double and so on.  I may not have mentioned but there are triple and even quad butts too.  These are a little easier to spot.  As for the cat call to follow, I would have to say that 'nice asses' is just too hard to say with the cumbersome double sssss, but a simple call such as 'Give me some,some, some of that double bum' should suffice and serve a second purpose of making you sound as though you are in with the rap lingo.  For those who don't know, there is a rap verse that goes 'Give me some, some, some of that in a bun' by Missy Ellliot.   Now for the ass grabbing I believe you have to go by size.  If the original bum still remains the largest, go with that one.  If not, you must be Big B after a couple of drinks.  Shooooo fat girls shooooo!  Today's Meals:  2 red pepper scrambled egg whites in tortilla shells, soy salami sandwich, pickles, orange, salad with flax, soy nuts and feta, brocoli, carrots, corn on the cob

      As my husband-to-be and I were watching  Friends  last night, I was analysing their I-eat-only-ricecakes bodies as usual.  I said to my HTB 'See...I want to be thin like Jennifer Anniston, but not Monica.  She's too thin'.  Well of course!!!  I mean, we all know Jennifer is practically a porker next to Monica(strong sarcastic tone).  I did some research and apparently Jennifer Anniston lost a drastic amount of weight using 'The Bone', ummm...I mean 'The Zone' diet.  Even her ex-trainer said he beleived she was loosing the weight the wrong way.  I think I am suffering from media overload.  As an intelligent and strong person I always felt that I was able to filter what the media fed women on a daily basis.  Apparently I was wrong.  As I was searching the web for Roxy bikini ads to display in my blog I came across a few great articles talking about the way media distorts women's self perception.     urlLink www.hilary.com/thought/britneyspears.html   urlLink www.hilary.com/fashion/bikini.html   I often think about about my friends and their varied views of their bodies.  My chum-the-no-bum or My-no-bum-chum, as she will be refered to from now on, has everything I don't have and I have everything she doesn't have.  Together we create a body ying yang that could represent most women in the world.  Her  C cup runeth over - My A cup is half empty...I mean half full.  I suppose I should start with positive self talk right?  I was blessed with a french bottom...and a second one on it's way (the double bum crease) - she uses those water inserts you get with bras to plump up her back side.  I even helped her sow pockets into her full bum underwear, so they wouldn't slide around.  I have been told my waist curves and hip explosion are of child bearing capabilties - she's about as curvey as an ironing board (besides those life-giving mammaries of course).  I was once told after taking off a sweater to reveal my arms to 'Oh my...eat something would you?' - she has strong arms and broad shoulders.  Anyways I could learn a lot from my no-bum-chum.  She has truly learned to accept herself for the way she is.  She loves her curves where she has them and accepts the lack of them in other spots.  In fact she loves herself so much, you have to peal her away from mirrors.  Some of her hobbies include: wearing low cut shirts, getting men to do whatever she wants, modeling for herself in morrors and trying on wedding dresses for hours when it isn't her getting married.  She is also so comfortable with herself that she will eat pretty much anything and everything in front of anyone and anybody.  SO I beleive that I will start to take notes on those faces she makes when she's looking at herself in the mirror.  Maybe those will help me.

      We're all aware of the double chin.  Those frog-necked fatties that carry fanny packs of fat under their jawline.  If they liposuctioned all that fat out, they could carry their babies in there.  Oh I know!!! You're mad I said fatties! Welcome to my brain-there are no emergency exists.  Fire extinguishers yes-but no emergency exits.  Anyways, most of us are also familiar with double plays, double standards and of course double mint gum.  But are you on the lookout for the ever stalking double bum?  It's that sneaky little ripple underneath the lower butt crease.  I'm sure you've seen it, but were so struck back you had no words to describe it.  Well, now you do!  THE DOUBLE BUM!  I myself have been victimized by this horrible affliction and just like the people with HIV, who have to take dozens of pills a day, I have to squat my double ass off everyday to keep it benign.  We all have our crosses to burn.  Or is that bear?  (looking devilishly and laughing maniacally)

      I decided that there shall never be mention of penny-bouncing off my ass again.  My friends just can't handle their men smashing every piggy bank in the house looking for pennies.  Wait a minute... if they all threw every penny they had at my ass, do I get to keep them all?  Maybe I could hire myself a personal trainer?  What would that really accomplish though?  Last time I was at the gym I was staring at the trainers thinking to myself:  You two need to spend a little less time working at the gym and spend a little more time working OUT at the gym .  That's right!  I'm a bitch AND a freak!  Please tell me I'm not the only one who thinks that the teacher of the ab conditioning class should have conditioned abs?  Today's Meals: Breakfast shake, granola bar, salad with flax and feta, orange, rice soup, black bean burrito with light cheese, broccolli, carrots, popcorn with seasoning  Today's Activity: 1/2 hour walk/jog/stairmast on trail

       urlLink    As I was looking over my blog site I realized that in one sentence I am saying I don't look like a freak and right across the page there is a picture of me with a pentacle and pink hair.  Hmmmm!  The pink hair was in direct rebelion of my oh-so-sweet look and this gives you a better idea of what I look like on a none-pink, none-pentacle day.  Perfectly precious!

      The primary purpose of starting this blog was to keep track of my fitness.  I now realize that I may be able to use this strangely appealing forum to get this fat woman lodged in between my brain and my skull out.  Now let me be perfectly clear: I don't have an extra large head.  I am 5'4" and weigh 120 lbs.  Yup that's right I am perfectly normal and well proportioned.  The problem is that over the last year I have found myself spending increasing amounts of time thinking about my weight.  Being trim is no longer good enough.  I want to be skinny.  SKINNY like the girl in the Roxy bikini ad.  I want to be bounce-a-penny-of-my-ass, can't-find-enough-fat-to-cook-a-pea-with, is-she-anorexic? SKINNY!  But I shouldn't dare say anything about it (looking suspiciously from side to side ensuring that no fat people overhear).  Pssst!  I am unhappy with my body.  DON'T SHOOT ME FOR MY FLAWS!  It's like fat people think they have a right to go around putting thin people down!  Some woman once told one of my skinny friends that she made her sick.  What the hell is that supposed to mean?  What if it was my skinny friend who said that to the fat woman?  Then what kind of fight would we have on our hands?  And what if she was sick or is sick?  The bottom line is body image is not dependant on your weight.  Please don't get me wrong:  I don't think I'm fat.  I just want to be skinnier.  Please feel free to respond.  I will have to shoot you if you say anything like 'you look fine' or 'you need to love yourself before you can love the outside'  (throwing up violently).   Anybody who knows me will tell you that in all other aspects I am a confident and self-assured independant woman.  Today's Activity: rest day  Today's Meals: Breakfast shake, salad with soy nuts, 4 perogies with fat free sour cream, apple, 1/2 fillet of snapper, 1/2 cup brown mushroom rice, slice of sourdough bread, salad with flax and soy nuts

      If you don't know me and especially if I hate you---DON"T ASK ME  HOW MY WEDDING PLANS ARE GOING!!!!  What gives people the idea that MY wedding is any of their fucking business?   Hey Venus...How's the wedding plans coming along?  So Venus...When's the big day?  Ohhhhh...getting clo-ose!   Blah!  Shut up!!!!!!  THAT'S MY PURSE...I DON'T KNOW YOU!  Okay maybe I have some small intimacy issues but only when it comes to people I hardly know asking me personal questions about the most important day of my life!  I don't feel the way most people feel about weddings.  We decided together that we didn't want a bunch of people watching us makes serious and deep vows to each other.  It felt like it was cheapening the experience.  We invited only people we truly loved and who knew us as a couple and understood all the reasons we were doing this.  The commercialism of this event sickens me.  After trying on every dress in four bridal shops, I finally found one that fit the bill(in more ways than one).  I actually saw the saleswoman make a face when she saw the price tag.  Oh God forbid she just spent 45 minutes with me for only $500 dollars. Then she thought she'd be able to make up the difference in ugly costume jewelry and over priced head pieces.  But alas I foiled her plan and ordered online.  I suppose I am suffering from a bit of 'bridal brain'.  No matter how long you've been together, how small the wedding will be or how close or not so close you are to your family, for a woman, it is inevitable that you will get bridal brain at one time or another during the planning, on that 'special' day, and/or during the post production.  My man and I are planning a wedding with 9 guests in Banff, Alberta.  I basically did the entire planning process over two weeks on the internet.  Just my style-no personal contact unless absolutely necessary and no annoying sales people hovering around trying to convince me that it's worth buying the three tier wedding cake 'for the memories'.  I feel like yelling  'I plan on remembering a beautiful ceremony where I pledged my life to my soul mate not how fluffy the flower decorated sugary lard cake tasted' .  People and their cake!!  I just don't get it!   'Oh Venus...What do your flowers look like?  What does your dress look like?  What size hosiery are you wearing?'   What is with all the questions?  And people are ALWAYS disappointed when I tell them it's a 9 guest ceremony with a reception in the VIP room of a nice restaurant.  It's like.. 'Oh...that's what you want?  Hmmm...Well, that's greeeeeat(strange facial expression indicating lieslieslies!)' .  Today it actually our general election voting day out here in igloo land and I feel the same way about disclosing my vote than I do about disclosing my wedding details.  It's just too personal to reveal to anybody but CLOSE friends.  Although I know there are a lot of women who feel very differently than me and choose to reveal every aspect of the planning at every stage of planning to anybody who will give them more than 10 seconds to speak.  I'm just not one of those idiots is all I'm saying!

      As you may have noticed in reading some of my blogs, there are many a thing that drive me crazy.  But that's the thing with being a bitch, even if you don't know what you like,  you most certainly know what you don't like.  For example, while grocery shopping today I was faced with a double-monster, the talkie-space-invader.  There's talkies and then there's space-invaders but this was a talkie-space-invader!!  I'm not kidding!  Standing right behind in line at the checkout.  And I do mean RIGHT behind me.  See I'm like the Spiderman of space-invaders, I feel them coming before I can even see them.  And I knew he was coming.  And I knew the pull was strong with him.  He walked up behind me and planted himself not one foot away from me, and then he put his arm on my cart!  MY cart!!  My repulsion is strong and I give a stern 'bitchy' look and pull my cart away from him.  But he persists (as these type always do) and he begins to speak to me as I pile my turnips up onto the conveyor belt:  'Wow!  This is a busy place.  (insert Donald-duck-like laugh here)   Shouldn't come on a Monday I guess'.   And then he stares at me like I'm supposed to respond when what I really want to do is abandon my groceries and bolt, screaming  'Take cover, a talkie-space-invader has landed at Save-on-Foods!!!'.   I do my best impression of a very busy person who isn't paying attention and I continue to unload my low-fat cheese product and nectarines.  Every inch I move, he follows.  As I pull my cart out to get the paper towel and laundry detergent from underneath I nearly knock him over.  I should have knocked him over!  As I wait to pay he stands 3 inches to my left and leans his monstrous hairy arm on the plastic shelf.  I try my best 'bitchy' look but he's oblivious and then the check out lady notices my look and she gives ME a look.  Like I'M the one with the problem.  I have done many horrible things in my life but I have NEVER made the assumption that strangers want to talk to me or feel the heat rise off my body in closeness.  I was so anxious to escape this situation I almost left one of my bags with the packing guy.  Now I will admit that I have a certain extreme sensitivity in this area, but that is mostly because I don't like most people.  And I thus believe that most people don't like me which is fine.  Less talking and processed foods would do us all a world of good.  Today's Meals:  Breakfast shake, nectarine, grapes, orange, 2 slices rye bread, imitation crab with no-fat mayo, granola bar, bean burritto with no-fat sour cream, low-fat cheese and brown rice, cabbage, green beans, broccoli  Today's Activity: 10 minute walk/jog warm-up, arm weight training, 30 minutes elliptical trainer  Today's Gym Weight: 114.6 lbs. It seems as though my body has decided to catch up with brain and start loosing weight.  This has my scale whoring at an all time high but what the fuck-my pants are so loose they're falling off.  Big B dubbed me droopy pants and my HTB keeps teasing me about my thong showing out the back.  I'll have to get a new wardrobe.  I'd like to see if I can get down to 107 lbs.  I've been as high as 128 lbs. so I'm about half way there.

      I have sunken to an new all-time low!  No, I didn't smash my scale then break down in tears, caressing it and carefully piecing it back together with toothpaste and rubber bands.  Well...not today anyways.  No, I didn't turn to the new woman at my work and say:  "It's called tweezers!!!!!!!!!!".   Although it takes everything in my being not to stare at her brow bushes.  And NO, I didn't verbalize the suggestion for my boss to get a mouthguard to help her with her unstoppable urge to eat.  Although I did mention an article I read about a mouthpiece which helps fast eaters take smaller bites.  She didn't bite on it though.  Too busy eating hoarded pie in her office.  What I did do was step on the scale and practically scream an orgasmic scream to see the numbers  116 !!!!  I yelled for my manbee to behold the red digits in all their beauty.   116 !!!!  I am starting to see the fruits of my labour-starvation and pilates!

      So you know it was a blog-worthy night when you accidentally leave yourself a phone message with nothing but distorted voices, loud music and monkey-like laughter. Stranger thing is I felt obligated to listen to the whole message just in case I could dicipher something somebody said.  But alas, the best I could hear was a man talking mumbly smurf talk and then a higher female voice laughing and talking (most definitely identified as my no bum chum). When we get together, it's like the bouquets of our pheromones blend so perfectly that men start dropping to the ground before us.  Which was great when we were single but is now just a prefered form of entertainment.  Sit, boy, sit - follow me - dance white boy dance like you've never danced before!  Watching us dance is a huge reward in itself because we both make very sensuous facial expressions which are sure to arouse anybody.  The problem is that if we are out to dance and have fun, we inevitably meet somebody to have fun with and dance with, they are inevitably attracted to one if not both of us and then we inevitably have to break the news that we are both in long term committed relationships.   Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!  Poor guys right?  Pfffft!  Poor us!  We are then treated like diseased chickens.  Of course they try to pretend they aren't kicking themselves for spending this much time with unfuckable women but they quickly find some excuse to rid themselves of these claimed clams.  Surely they noticed the strong smell of urine coming off us and the little flags protruding from our crotches claiming these pussies as discovered and owned.  Last night was a perfect example of this.  We started the night at a comedy club.  We'd been there a couple of times before and especially enjoy ourselves if we prep with a few tokes on the way.  You must restrain from too much laughter though, otherwise the Comedy Nazi will be on your tail.   Shhhhhhh! While the comics are on stage you must keep it down!  (intense eye glare with slight eyebulge) Oh of course!  I'm sorry!  I thought we were at a comedy club or something.  The comics must get so annoyed when we laugh, really must distract them! The Comedy Nazi is astute and sly.  He roams the room just waiting for a loud-laugher or a side-joke-teller to rear their ugly heads so that he can quickly put out the flame.   No laugh for you!   We all know that Comedy Clubs are the scene for many a riot, so he must be diligent and maintain the control in a place that could explode in laughter at any moment.  Hats off to you Comedy Nazi! for providing us with entertainment throughout the last half of the feature act and again we apologize for all the noise. (bowing head in shame) Shortly after the end of the show, the Pheromone Queens decided that we would make our way out to a dirty old country bar we love.  As we are getting into the taxi one of the comics, who looks suspiciously like Seth Green, asks if we need a ride somewhere.  But alas, him and his comic friend were cultured down town folk and were reluctant to enter to world of cowboys and indians.  But the scent is strong with us and he couldn't help but follow his nose, later showing up despite his fear of chaps.  Of course at this point he had no idea that we were diseased chickens and was paying no attention to the urine smell or the crotch flags.  Did I mention that he looks like Seth Green? and his friend's a ringer for...well...a black female comedian, so you can imagine they must feel right at home in a country bar.  It was quickly apparent that they were much too intelligent for country, but gathering material in like a snow plow is a good enough excuse to stick around I suppose.  I began to get this paranoid feeling that we were being made fun of.  Either because we were or because these are funny people, that's what they do!!!  So by the end of the night I'm feeling like a paranoid schizo diseased chicken but hey it will go down in the Pheromone Queens books as a classic night of tomfoolery.

      So I am currently maintaining a weight of 118 lbs. which is 5 pounds lighter than I started 3 months ago.  5 pounds!!!! (huge eye roll with large sigh)  I have calculated my daily caloric intake to be 1250-1500 on average.  I go to the gym 3 times a week, pilates 2 times a week, and walking 2-3 times a week.  I am beginning to understand why loosing weight the 'right' way is unpopular and diets which promise that you'll shit out at least five pounds in the first 5 days are all the rage.  I suppose I could look at it this way: at least I'm not spending all my time on the toilet.  Here's a fun thing: My boss asked me to help her loose weight.  So now not only will she hate me because I look good but now she has found a way to be able to blame me for her failure at weight loss.  It's only because I need money to sustain my eating habit that I don't just tell her that she would notice a large difference if she didn't hoard food in her office drawers and feel it necessary to eat any food left over from anything.  How can she justify eating that much, wearing THOSE shorts with THOSE thighs AND complaining about her weight?  Complaining is an earned privilege not a right!

      This may be an unpopular blog with some but those of you who are true BITCHES or the masculine form of a bitch, a 'manbee'(from man Bitch), will understand what I'm trying to say.  Side note: Manbees are in danger of extinction.  Sure... they are still the predominant genre of man available these days but as the years go by the population is decreasing dramatically.  Parents these days are trying to be more and more politically correct.  I like to refer to these as 'pillow parents', because they spend have their day crying into their pillows about what terrible parents they are.  These 'pillow parents' are raising their boys with barbies and dolls, telling them they should cry every opportunity they get and then blaming themselves for every mistake their child makes.  From this generation we are yielding cry babies, mamma's boys and the worst of all, the ignorant I-can't-live-on-my-own-cause-it's-just-too=darn-hard-so-I'll-live-at-home-my-whole-life adult child.  I myself was lucky enough to cross paths with a manbee and together we will keep the bloodline clean, creating only strong and independent children.  In fact we plan to kill any that don't live up to our standards of humanity.  How else can we ensure the whinny won't prevail? Anyways, I am way off topic.  Today I bitch about beautyism.  Beautyism you say?  That's right!  It's discrimination based on...you guessed it...beauty.  If you didn't guess that find a new blog to read, something more you're speed.  One named 'My blog' or 'My journal' will probably suit you better.  Anyways those of you still following me...let's move one.  I believe that I have been a victim of this form of discrimination many times in my life.  Surprisingly to some, mostly by women.  For example, at my job there was a memo put out last summer reminding everybody that 'appropriate dress' was required even during the hot months.  With this reminder in mind, I put away my fish net stockings and micro mini skirts, and tried to make sure I could not be mistaken for a sunbather while at work.  For you women out there, you've got to know how difficult it is to find a pair of pants and a shirt that actually meet in the middle.  It's fucking impossible these days!  Which isn't a good thing when 55% of people in Canada are overweight.  I'll tell you...you'd think back fat was a trend.  If they hollowed out their back rolls with liposuction, they could probably do without back packs!  Anyways, I ended up getting spoken to by a manager about the memo, telling me that I was STILL not dressing appropriately.  I was shocked!  Oh yah! Did I mention she's a lesbian.  A full on carpet munching, butch loving, lesbian!  I truly believe that if I was 20 lbs. heavier and a little less symmetrical facially that she never would have noticed the 1 cm (centimeter, or about a third of an inch for our American foes)of skin showing over my jeans.  Skin is much more noticeable when it's attractive.  The gym is another classic place for beautyists to spew their hate on you.  They hold sight of you and immediately that right eyebrow raises,  'what a bitch!', 'she thinks she is such hot shit', 'I hate her I hate her!'.     I AM a bitch, I DO think I look like hot shit especially compared to you, and I hate YOU too!   But I usually just smile and try not to make it apparent that I noticed their socks aren't matching due too their over overwhelming belly pouch.  Fanny pack anyone?  People often say things like  'well you don't have to worry, look at you'  or ' I wish I could look like you'  but what they are really feeling is  'fucking bitch I hope you fall face first from a ladder and then gain 100 lbs. so that you would stop making me feel bad about that pie I ate for afternoon snack'.   Jealousy is vengeful too!  You must never look too good in front of those who envy you.  They will do anything in their power, besides loose weight and wear some makeup, to make themselves feel better.  Beware of the snack-time-pie-eating fatties who have low self esteem and want to find a way to surgically implant yours into them.  That is all for now. This blog is dedicated to my one and only non-friend fan, Joe!  Thanks for rolling with my punches.

      I have a couple of questions for this almighty God that everybody keeps talking about:  1)If thirteen year old girls shouldn't have babies, then why are their wombs nesting for implantation?  Even a complete idiot would think to coincide the estimated appropriate time of child bearing with the time their bodies start painting the womb walls pretty pastels.  2)If I shouldn't eat more, then why am I still hungry?  This body device that's supposed to tell me when to eat and when not to eat is faulty.  It's stuck on EAT!  Why should people suffer to maintain weight or health?  3)If fatty and sugary foods are bad for your health then why make them taste good?  Sure, we blame the fact that poison tastes bad on the logical explanation that it's to protect us from drinking or eating something harmful, but if this is so, then why wouldn't fat and sugar taste awful to protect us from a life of baby carrying double chins and online moo-moo shopping?  4)If smoking, drinking, drugs, gambling and other such addictions are so destructive to your body and life, why make them so enjoyable?  I mean why not make broccoli addictive?  or tarragon?  Wouldn't that only be fair?  I'll publish this now but I'll be adding to this list over the next while.  Today's Meals: Breakfast shake, orange, dried fruit snack, beans in tomatoe sauce with whole wheat melba toast, granola bar, chili, asparugus, bok choy  Today's Activity: Rest day

      I have found in my successful fight with calories that the best way to shed those dimply pounds is regurgitating your meals shortly after injestion. This is my advice to those who are wondering. What? No good? Some people seem to think that must be what I'm doing. For about the hundreth time a co-worker asked me how I lost the weight. If I had my way my response would be a quick palm plant into their forehead but civilized cultur prevails and holds my instincts back. How do you think I lost the weight? Do I have some never-before-discovered weight loss secret that encorporated large portions of butter chicken into the diet? Or have I perhaps discovered a way to give yourself gastric bypass surgery in the comfort of your own home? Of course I have to then break the news that eating less and more nutritionally dense foods was my formula. Oh shit! Can you beleive it? Eating less? What a concept fuckers! Chear with me people!   Come on fatties   Let's get real   Just eat dick   Instead of veal   Ooops! Did I say 'dick'? How offending! I apologize, I meant:   Get up lard ass   Let's get thin   Fuck it off   He'll need some gin      Don't just lay there   Help him fit   Hold your rolls    He'll find your clit      And if he can't   Then find your own   This'll help   Your forearm tone    Don't get lost   I  know it's scary Just relax Some men love hairy  Most of all Remember this It ain't so bad To take a fist  You know you are thin enough when people start raising an eyebrow when you have to use the washroom after or during a meal. I find myself rushing in the washroom so that nobody gets the wrong idea(this is especially hard with the scale whoring combination). Then people look at me like: what are you in such a hurry for? You can't fucking win with these people! t doesn't matter what I do. I'm obviously sick and demented. Otherwise, what are they?

Hey, look at me...I bought this shirt at a REAL bike shop...this lighter-100% genuine Harley...and this flashlight?-oh yah it's a Harley. &nbsp; It's almost like a person who goes around claiming to be gay but never actually has sex with anybody.&nbsp; Or a kid who wears 'skate' shoes and&nbsp;pants ten sizes too big&nbsp;but has never even tried boarding.&nbsp; Damn weenies!&nbsp; I guess you can just choose your&nbsp;labels like&nbsp;you choose your underwear.&nbsp;  I think I'll be a dike today  or  I'm a  doctor.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Buddha would agree that those who talk and talk about being a 'BIKER' but never produce proof of a bike are merely sleeved sissy boys with no balls. &nbsp; OH...I have a bike but it's...um...in the shed..yah...in storage...right. &nbsp; Sure Big B!&nbsp;  Show me the bike pussy boy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      I have found in my years of adventures, that you can directly link the amount of phlem build up in your throat to the amount of fun you had the previous night.  Let's just say I sound worse than a 50 year old crack whore with a dick in her mouth.  It all started with a simple idea: A Girls Weekend Away!   PENTICTON  we cheered as we made list after list to ensure we didn't forget toothpaste or air mattresses or rope.  Such essentials lacking would most certainly...ahhhhh...ahhhhh...where are those monkey wrenches coming from?  Of course the rain followed us(it must have a penis too).  We quickly realized that the only logical way to get the tarp up without rope was to tie Save-On-Foods bags and garbage bags end to end.  Anybody else would have come to the same conclusion...I'm sure of it...well pretty sure...well okay fine anybody else would have driven the 5 minutes to Walmart and bought rope but we are women-we are 'resourceful'.  This is especially true when you spend 45 minutes straightening your hair in the morning and the testosterone engorged rain is threatening to take our dreams of straight flat hair away!  DAMN YOU!  Of course the giant holes in the tarp didn't help but we managed to stay drier than most Pentictonites who stared at us with perplexed faces as we tied a strange blue plastic sheet above our heads.  It didn't take longer than 15 minutes of post rain for the pheromones to start circling with the wind.  Like fearful but curious squirrels they hover close then retreat as they try to plan their approach.  The truth was clear No-Bum and I were no longer souly the Pheromone Queens but we had now flourished into...  The Pheromone Quads .  And we welcomed the two new recruits because we knew that our powers had strengthened.  Even 'Iron Man' training, cops melted into 'secret smokers' as we taught them how to own the club.  Using random men as face cloths for your not-so-good-aim drinking habits shows class but also says  'This entire club is my napkin' .  Starting a chain tobacco is also a good way of inducing 7 years of bad luck on anybody who doesn't pass it on.  And of course simulating sex with a paper mache blue mule says:  I'll have sex with any unnaturally coloured mammal .  That's right!  We know all the tricks!  And even when one of our flock weakens and decides to spend the rest the night in a lawn chair with the smokie guy out front, we persist.  We dance on!  We 'maintain' right until G & R sings about the thorns on roses and then the goal is clear: FOOD!  Of course food was of less concern for Bambi outside as she had eaten 73 smokies bought for her by random men who couldn't help but feed the drunk little women waiting for her friends.  I'll have to remember a sign for next time  'Please do not feed or supply heroine' .  As we all climbed into cabs I was brutally rebuffed and sent in the cab with non-eaters and left with no chance of seeing the 7-11 that night.  But I did get the recap later.  Reportedly, slurpee guzzling is a women's sport!  According to the World Champion Lisa Burrito  'Girls just have the ability to swallow better.  It's an innate trait that we are born with' .  Colin the FabuTan man proved her point by demonstrating his lack of ability to create a proper seal around the nozzle.  This lead to Java-Slurpee-T-shirt-Syndrome or JSTS.   How much for 2 seconds in the mouth and a couple seconds on my shoulder? .  And of course No-Bum's alter ego came out for a jaunt around the green glowing convenient store:  Lisa Burrito was out in full force, chomping on bean and cheese burritos like no one was watching.  'Crazy Lisa Taco Burrito' makes one more appearance the following evening as well, but let's recount in chronological order.  After the food crew returned to the camp site and the lantern was instantly lit, Bambi decided to make a little love with the pavement.  Can you blame her really when she had 73 smokies with her heroine!  If I had 73 smokies with my cocaine I would've been laying right there beside her.  You have to do your drugs clean!  For sure!   Day Two  Venus gets a head start on the day by clearing about 73 pounds of mucus out of her allergy-dumped-on sinuses.  Wahoo!(sexy dance for the mucus)  And as we slowly stir and rise we realize that toothpaste will be in high demand so we breathe on Colin and thus force him to hand over the goods.  The Iron-Man training cops and their accessories decided that one married woman, one engaged woman and two questionably concealing women just didn't leave enough hope to stick around so they dragged FabuTan by his big toe away from our campsite and headed back to Edmonton as he screamed  'I LOVE YOU GUYS!' . Now what?  The campsite had cleared out and we were left questioning our skills as women.  We decided that maybe we weren't tanned enough and that was the problem, so we headed to the beach.  And sure enough the tans helped.  Not 10 minutes after discussing how awesome it would be to have a boat, a small comment about disguising liquor is acknowledged and a target has been placed on us.  Hey do you guys want to come for a wake board on our boat?   Safety brain checks in saying  assessing danger...assessing...assessing...danger low due to similar body mass ratio between men and women .  So being gang raped and dumped in the lake was probably unlikely, however we were still concerned about giving up our pretty beach girl images and looking like fools.  No-Bum took the challenge after some coaxing but couldn't stop plowing.  Plowing eh?  Then it was future MILF who jumped on the board and showed me some hope of succeeding so I let my wrestling mind frame take over and decided that the guy with the blue eyes would see me up.  And he did cause I did it on my second try!  I don't think it would have been possible to have more fun than we did.  The wake board boys couldn't have been more patient with Crazy Lisa as we cruised the lake looking for her jean skirt that decided it was done with living in Lisa's over crowded closet and wanted to be free.  Well it got its wish!  So we parted ways and the boys said they'd make an appearance later at our family oriented campground.  Despite the fact that the sun had sucked every ounce of energy out of our bodies, we dredged on, using alcohol as crutches to keep us up.  And when the boys got there they brought guitars and energy with them.  With energy comes loudness and with children being 'put down' in other sites we were liable to get booted if we stayed so we decided that drunken walks are not only for 15 year olds and made a move for the park.  But it wasn't long before Taco started to fantasize about the green glow, the hum of the coolers, the chrome microwave, and of course the smooth satisfying taste of a bean filled burrito.  Lisa Burrito was on a mission and blue eyes wanted in.  He generously(or selfishly) offered to drive 3 girls in his truck to the 7-11 for a reprise of the previous night.  The slurpees were spared this time though.  It was a full fledged burrito attack, they never knew what was coming and never had the brilliant 7-11 clerk seen such stealthy moves.  As one moved right the other move left complimenting each other with their choreographed moves, incorporating nacho cheese sauce into their moves and ranking in the top 3 internationally for Early Morning Couples Burrito Eating.  It was incredible that they were able to place with almost no prep time and absolutely no coaching whatsoever.  Alcohol, a performance inhibiting drug?  I don't think so!  The quadruple sowcow of the night was Taco filling a coffee cup with cheese for the road and Blue Eyes filling his pockets with burritos for the road.  They key is confusing the clerk so much that they give up.  Taco and Blue Eyes decided that the  best way to keep the burrito eating fair was for Lisa to squish into the crotch shifting seat and that way he could dip his burrito in her cheese.  It was only logical right?  And of course Geoff the blue eyed photographer decides to take mini sombrero pictures of Taco and her signature food.  Nice move!  The night ended with MILF and Taco sneaking off to bed under the mise of going to the washroom, many deep discussions about astrology and ass-mouths with the brothers.  I also learned that I'm 'slight', which is probably the coolest thing I've heard since I lost 15 pounds.  That ones going in the vault of compliments and I don't even think it was meant as a compliment as much as an observation but that's what made it so great.  And since nobody knew where a cemetery was in Penticton and Bambi needed to take her 'tacts out, I walked my one cold leg and one warm leg back to our site and simmered down to a low boil.  This was no doubt one of the best trips I've ever been on!  For sure!

      This is simply to notify my readers that Big B will henceforth and forever more be referred to as Hammer Head. I wish not to discuss the reasons, for fear of further psychological scaring.
