      I work up before 7:00 this morning to drive John to work.  As I dropped him off, his manager ran out the door to greet him and then waved to me.  I stuck my head out the window and she responded that she thought I was "John's handsome father."  Keep in mind that this woman is at least fifty and my dad is -- well he's my dad!  I got an Egg McMuffin there and it was pretty good.  However, the man who served me called me "sir" way too much.  It was kind of freaky.  On the way home, the incredibly stupid Nancy Hall on Q105 mentioned this web site below:  urlLink Pardon Martha Stewart Petition   I signed it and you should too!  However, she said President Bush would be too busy to look at it because of everything else he's doing.  But stupid Nancy doesn't realize that the President only signs a pardon; people who work for him do the work.  I have to go get ready for work.  I'm working 9 to 5 and then 6 to 8.  Before work, though, I have to return stuff to the hardware store in Mystic.  Maybe tonite I'll watch Gladiator chez Corey.

      My eagle scout project is going along very well, but is taking a bit longer than I expected thus far.&nbsp; The painting process is a bit slow because we always have to wait for the paint to dry, the walls are wierd (concrete), and because the ceilings are so high.  Today will be the last day of painting (starting @ 11:00) and then all I'll have to do is put in the countertop (next Tuesday) and have everything tidied up and organized (hopefully Wednesday).  Thanks to everyone who has helped me out so far and if you, the reader, would like to help feel free to get in touch with me and we can plan something out.  I've gotta go do some chores and get ready for the project.&nbsp; I'll write again soon.

      Tonite I went to Margaritas with friends from work.&nbsp; Tres fun.&nbsp;   This summer has been really fun because I can drive places.&nbsp; Because of this, I don't need to worry about getting rides to places so things can happen more last minute.&nbsp; And that makes it fun.&nbsp; Plus I can drive myself home and not need to get rides from my parents.&nbsp; I just let them know when I get home.&nbsp; But I still have that pesky curfew of 11:00 PM.&nbsp; I wish I could get rid of it, but I can't.&nbsp; (Note:&nbsp; I can stay out later if I'm at a movie that starts late but I still can't get out of coming home directly after.)   Look, I've already started writing too much in this blog and soon its gonna get old.&nbsp; Please forgive me when I stop using this one too because I can't really commit to anything.   I have to go now because I can hear people screaming across the street which to me suggests drunken brawl so I'm gonna sit on the porch and listen.&nbsp; Until later - how much later, God only knows.   P.S. Some woman came to the door and I thought she had to do with the drunk people (who stopped making noise now) but she's just one of John's friend's mom.

      You may remember my last blog (livejournal.com/users/mc87crew) and if you remember that you'll remember how i wrote a lot for about three days then it died.&nbsp; I decided to try the whole process again when I saw a friends blog on this site.&nbsp; It looked cooler and more "user-friendly," plus since it was different it wouldn't be as cliche (I hate that word  SO  much).  &nbsp;  This blog will be nothing special.&nbsp; Well, I can't guarantee that -- especially if you think I'm something special.&nbsp; But then you'd definetily be in the minority and you should find a really good therapist or just a sharp knife to slit your ... well lets not go there.  &nbsp;  I leave you today (maybe not -- I might write again!) with a thought from : "When in Rome."&nbsp; And when you're not in Rome, well you're definitly screwed there.&nbsp; Have a nice time with my blog!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I just saw  The Village  with Emily and Corey after dining at Ruby Tuesdays. The movie was GREAT -- I can't say much about it but I highly reccomend it.  I haven't written in a while but thats mostly because nothing majorly exciting has happened in my life recently nor have I had much time to sit by the computer.  Hopefully I'll be able to post again sooner!

      Hey everyone---  I've been working on the BBC's new web page for the past hour and decided to take a bread to put up the first post on this blog.  In case you didn't get to this site through a link on the BBC's home page, check it out  urlLink here .  Members of the BBC staff will be posting on this site whenever they feel like it so that you can see what it is like to produce out daily broadcasts.  Since our old set is now part of the construction site, we'll soon be moving our set to what used to be the Faculty room and make that our home for the next year (hopefully not any longer than that!).  Stop by this blog often to see what is going on in the BBC!

      Welcome to the online magazine "ON TOP of the world", which stands for "Opinionated News for Ticked Off People of the World." (If you're wondering why the title is so longwinded, you obviously don't know me very well... give it time.) Our goal is to make this a place where you can come to listen to people sit on their asses and complain about the issues that you sit on YOUR ass and complain about! Because I cannot lean any further right, politically speaking, without falling over and hurting myself, I've decided to get together with my liberal friend, Matt Collette, to create this publication. Only Fox News - one of the most middle-of-the-road TV stations ever secretly controlled by Ronald Reagon - has been able to provide such fairness and balance up to this point in time.   Some of you may be wondering why I'm writing an introduction to this website when my colleage has already done so. The reason is that his introduction sucks. First of all, he was very informal. Now don't get me wrong - I'm all for an informal publication. But in an editorial there is a certain professionalist feel that needs to be given. Second of all, he keeps calling this a "blog". I know that that is the technical name for this type of website, but we are merely using this form to create an online magazine.   I told him these things, and told him that he should fix it, though really I was thinking that I should have been the one to write it, anyway - I am, after all, the Editor in Chief. He suggested that I write my own if I wish, as it would showcase our differences. Well, I guess in that we have succeeded, for you can already see that he is wrong and I am right. That, I imagine, will be the general tone of this publication.   For those of you who don't know me well, I am infamous for these online writings for two reasons: one, I do not update them frequently; and two (and this is the biggie), I have been known to offend people. The last time I attempted something like this, I ended up having to fend off an entire army of skateboarders. If you want a lesson in the benefits of joining a union, go ask the skateboarders - trust me, those mothers can band together like Baptists at a Catholic boarding school.   Well, I suppose that I should wrap this up shortly. Please - check back often for updates. We plan on discussing a hot issue from two points of view - Matt's and my own - on at least a weekly basis, and will be adding personal updates frequently, too. We may even pull in some guest writers, if we don't scare everyone away too fast. Most importantly to note is that we have no idea what direction we're going with this, so not only do we welcome your input, but we probably will need it if we want to save ourselves from looking like asses.   And remember - if there's an issue that needs to be discussed, we'll be "ON TOP" of it. And hopefully without too many lame, cliche jokes and taglines.   Thanks for reading.   - Corey Prachniak  "Editor in Chief"  AKA Right Wing Nut Job

      Hey everyone!&nbsp; Corey and I decided to start this site to talk about stuff thats going on and what we think about stuff.   And I can already tell that this site is going to be interesting.&nbsp; We've "quarrelled" about this blog already (thats why we both have a post explaining what this is all about) and you can also respond to what we think by clicking on the bottom of our entry and putting your opinion.&nbsp; That is unless one of us decides not to let you comment on it.&nbsp; But I doubt I'll do that, nor will my co-author Corey.   I hope you enjoy reading this as much as we'll enjoy writing it.&nbsp; And don't forget to give us your own opinion in the process!   Stay tuned for more of my left-winged thoughts!

      Here are some common reasons that people use when describing why they think that John Kerry should be president... followed by facts that prove these "reasons" to be nothing but pure fiction.  1 - DONT vote for Kerry because "he would not have dragged us into war." According to a recent statement from Kerry, even if he had known that Sadam did not have weapons of mass destruction, he still would have brought us to war JUST LIKE BUSH DID - in fact, Kerry states that he would have made all the choices that Bush made, including acting without UN sanction, but that he just would have made different wartime choices in the actual battles.  2 - DONT vote for Kerry because "he will work for the average American, not just the rich." Okay, here's a newsflash:  Kerry is rich, his biggest supporters are rich, and - just like every other politician in US history (including, I'll admit, Bush) - he's never going to do ANYTHING without at least a little consideration for those paying the bills.  Yes, Bush gave tax cuts to the rich, and gave less to "middle America."  But consider these two facts:  first of all, the rich (obviously) have a lot more money, so giving every million- and billionaire $100,000, for example, is the same percentage as giving a guy who makes $30,000 a year a grand back; second, Bush gave SOME money to the middle class, and tried to give even MORE, but guess who voted against it?  That's right, John Kerry.  Kerry voted AGAINST tax cuts for the middle class, even though now he's yelling at Bush for not doing it.  Plus, before you think that Kerry is really going to be a man "for the masses", remember that 99% of the entertainment industry (think Michael Moore, DMB, Michelle Branch, and the omni-present Susan Surandon/Tim Robbins duo) has come out to support John Kerry - and these are the richest 1% of the American people!  You can bet your ass that if Kerry really was going to play favorites any less to the wealthy than Bush would, America's richest wouldn't be showing Kerry their support.  Think about it.  3 - DONT vote for Kerry because "our economy is bad and he needs to fix it." America has just gone through the biggest job growth in US history.  The stock market is starting to go up.  Sure, the economy wasn't the best for a little while, but then again we had just gone through September 11th - an event that cost us $100 Billion, not including the wars in Afganistan or Iraq (and let's not forget that one of the reasons why the economy seemed so good in Clinton's time was that he SEVERLY cut defense spending - something that seemed to do us a damn lot of good in Fall of 2001, didn't it?)  Some people say that the economy is bad, and we need Kerry to fix it, but this simply isn't true.  There's nothing wrong with the economy.  Jobs are being created at historic levels, companies are all on rebounds, AND while oil prices are rising, the growth is considerably less, when taking into account inflation, than it has been many times over the past 35 years.  Here's another thing to ponder:  if Bush was not the way to fix the economy, why would every economic group in the US, including Wall Street, be backing him and his policies?  4 - DONT vote for Kerry because "he was a great soldier and knows about war." According to a new book, Unfit To Lead, in which more than 240 men who served in Viet Nam on the same watercraft as did John Kerry (including many in his unit) contributed, Kerry has lied time and time again about his war record, including where he served and what he did.  For example, he said that on Christmas day he was in a location that it would have been impossible to get to, and when pointed out this fact, Kerry said something along the lines of "oh, well maybe I didn't go there."  Sure, there are groups like Veterans for Kerry that support him, but these men did not serve with Kerry and many, including one of there top spokesman, didn't do anything war-related even close to what Kerry did, and so is about as useful a source as I am describing college-level physics.  Furthermore, an overwelming majority of our nation's veterans support Bush, and that certainly says something.  5 - DONT vote for Kerry because "he believes in what I believe in." To be honest, Kerry might believe in exactly what you believe in; the problem is that no one really knows for sure!  Kerry has been flip-flopping back and forth on almost every issue over the past few years, particularly since the campaign started.  Kerry says that he doesn't believe in abortion, but according to his voting record he has voted FOR abortion - in all sense of the word, mind you, meaning that he has voted for ALL abortions (including, therefore, late-pregnancy ones) - on dozens and dozens of occasions.  He says that he doesn't believe in gay marriage, yet he has voted FOR gay marriage many times and has supported Massachussetts's plan to make gay marriage legal.  So no matter where you stand on these or any issues, it's rather hard to tell if John Kerry is on your side or not!  Those are some reasons NOT to use in deciding to vote for John Kerry.  If you still have reason to do so, then by all means, give him your support.  But you'd best not vote for him for those reasons because - and probably many others - because they are not truths but are merely lies from the Kerry camp trying to steal away your votes.

      I apoligize that my post is going to be brief, but it is based on the fact the  I really couldn't agree with Corey much more . Though Americans are divided, they are divided for the  same reason ; they want America to be the best it can be but differ in their opinions as to how do do it. This delimma has been the same throughout history - parties have also bickered and attacked ideas and politicians.  Though the issues we argue over are different today than they were in the late 1770's, we argue for the same reason. Each side wants to make American the best it can be, but each side sees a different route that America must take. Imagine this in terms of two different family vacations:

      In the months following the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, the phrase "united we stand" became a popular saying, almost to the point of becoming a cliche.  At the time, I took it to be a war call, a method of intimidation to America's enemies that we were not a people who would allow such an attack to go unpunished.  It was an attack plan, a call to arms, and one that resulted in one of the most unifying efforts in American history.  During this period, there was a lesser-known clause which I had also heard from time to time: "divided we fall."  Swept up in the wave of patriatism and eagerness to bring those who had attacked us to justice, I paid this phrase little heed.  Indeed, for a short time it seemed that most Americans couldn't even remember a time when we were not united under one cause.  Since that "fatefull day", as it has so often been called, almost three years have gone by, and much has changed in our country.  Much of what has occured during that time have become the major issues in the upcoming election; the state of the economy, the reforms made to national security, and the wartime decisions and actions made all seem to be key factors in who Americans will be giving their votes to in November.  Of  course, as a young, politically-minded American, I share some concern in these election-related areas, and have certianly considered them over the past few months.  But to me, a much bigger and more pressing issue has emerged as things have heated up in the States, and that is the unity of our people.  Back when the founding fathers of our nation met to fight for and shape a new country, they were not nearly as agreeable and one-minded as many textbook interpretations have led us to sometimes believe.  Just like we do today, in the twenty-first century, the revolutionaries of the 1700s had their share of controversies and disagreements.  Whether arguing over how many delegates each state should get in the legislature, where to locate the nation's capitol, or whether the fedralists or the antifedralists had correct notions in regards to state-versus-federal power, the brave men and women who created America were certianly in near constant disagreement.  To some modern people, it appears to be miraculous that our country was created at all.  How, with all of this disagreement, had their been enough strength to create what quickly became to most powerful nation on earth?  The answer, I believe, is that for all of their differences, our founders were united in a single cause: to create and protect a free and just country.  At the end of the day, when the debate hall doors were swung shut and the newly-dubbed Americans made their way back to their homes, they were all united, despite their differences.  And when it was time to fight and to protect that which they loved, our brave forefathers thought not of what they disagreed on but rather on what brought them together.  This amazing bond between every man and woman in America remained strong.  Many times, it waivered slightly, and once - in the Civil War, the darkest of times in history - the forces that drove America apart did, for a brief period, outweigh the bonds pulling it together.  But now I ask you: where is this unity that has so long served and empowered our people?  What has happened to the bonds that have for so long kept us together?  Over the years, America has learned to express itself, to speak out against injustice, and to make loud and unyeilding calls for reform; but despite all that we have learned, we have forgotten to be united, and to stand together as one great people.  I know that this unity is waivering when the entire "Current Events" section of the local bookstore is filled with publications called the President of the United States an idiot or a liar, or when the leaders of our nation are referred to as "stupid white men"; likewise, I can feel it dying when I hear the Democratic National Convention being called the "meeting of our enemy", and when political ads suggest that anti-war means anti-patriotic.  The problem, I believe, has developed because many Americans have forgotten two things: first of all, that one can disagree with another while still showing that person respect; and second, that despite our differences, Americans have always and do now share one goal, and that is to make our nation and world the safest, most productive, and most free that it can be.  Too soon have we forgotten that we can express our differences without overshadowing our similarities; too soon have we forgotten that we can hate a man's idea but still love the man; and too soon have we forgotten that the ties that bind us far outnumber and overpower those that would tear us apart.  So now when I say "united we stand", it is more than an empty slogan, more than a call to arms in a desperate time; it is a powerful and all-important reminder that if we hope to achieve anything, we must work towards it together - not as enemies or competitors in a political arena, but rather as sons and daughters of America, and fighters for freedom and justice.  Of course, we will sometimes disagree, and we will surely never be in complete agreement; but if hatefulness, negativity, and mudslinging have any place, it is not in the America that I know and love.  Above all else, we must not become a people divided.  So when asked what you are, do not answer that you are a Democrat or a Republican, a member of the Reform Party or a member of the Green; but rather, answer that you are an American, for only through unity and brotherhood can our individual voices be heard and our beloved freedom be proected.
