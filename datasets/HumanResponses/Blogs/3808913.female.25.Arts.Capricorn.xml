       Whiskeytango  wow. last night's gig went great. but my guitar has weird stage fright issues. i tune it right before i go on, and the second we hit the stage, it falls out of tune like 'whoa.' and i'm like, why are you doing this? yeah, that's the picture... me soothing my guitar, giving it a pep talk before we perform... lol. good stuff. i tried out some new songs and was very happy that they were received well. i was even approached by the girl who runs the thing and she invited me to be a part of some compilation cd they're putting together. so that's vedy vedy cool. just another thing to put in my press kit. woot woot.   Calypso Joe's of Vestavia  wow. my sticker is officially on a girl's VW car. how cool is that? so is she considered my first fan? tonight's gig was nice, but i was strangely calm... or was it lazy? the songs lacked the energy i usually put forth... who knows. maybe i was too comfortable. but the venue was nice... it was outdoors and you couldn't ask for a more beautiful night.   22nd Street Jazz Cafe  i am exhausted. i didn't get home til 1:30am from last night's gig, and had to be at work at 6am. blech. i feel like poo. thank god today is friday. i'll have the weekend to recoop. last night went really well... i met an  amazing  guitarist, eddie warren ( urlLink www.eddiewarren.com ). it's rare that you're in the presence of an actual phenomenon. i sat there, jaw on the floor, during his entire set. jesus christ, i've never heard anyone play the guitar quite like him. if there was ever any one person who is  one  with a guitar, it would be him. he approached me after i stepped off the stage and handed me his CD. "i was wondering if you'd be interested in collaborating with me..." ''me? what do you need me for? you're a one-man show. you're brilliant. you're the  word ,  brilliant ."   *mental note: don't be such a blubbering idiot when in the presence of a force of nature*

      Well the Atlantis Music Conference came and went... it was loaded with helpful information and invaluable networking opportunities. But it was hard not to feel overwhelmed. There is so much to think about, so many different routes to take, to decide on, to choose from, as an independent artist. It was overwhelming, hard not to feel lost in a sea of hopefuls. But invigorating to know there are so many options out there.  I'll be in the studio the 2nd week of August, which I am very very excited about. I can't tell you how excited I am to finally start working on this project. I can't wait to see what comes about.

      will be back in the studio faster than you can say 'house of wood.' I plan on starting late July into August. I hope to release the record into the world late August/early September. Can you say 'Jen is thrilled'? Yes yes yes, makes me vedy vedy happy. And, in addition to the original tunes, I plan on adding two bonus tracks for your lovely listening pleasure. Now tell me, who loves ya baby?

      this past weekend was bliss wherein i lived music. eat-sleep-breathe. we are very happy. to the Nth degree. yes we are. which makes the daily grind much more jarring to return to.   met with both producers/engineers in 'nashvegas' and we hit it off. musically, creatively, socially. it's inspiring and emotionally thrilling to find people who share the same creative ideas. they both quickly grasped the vision of the record, which makes me doubly excited to start rolling tape. (or rather, 'spinning silver' - is that what one would call it? since we're in the digital age?) both were so kind and hospitable, and seemed eager to start working. having people who are passionately involved in the same creative product is just... god. it's such a humbling and awe-inspiring feeling. i am just so thankful. so thankful. it really makes me wonder, why? why would anyone want to work with me? it's amazing. it's the word, amazing. and i can't can't can't wait.
