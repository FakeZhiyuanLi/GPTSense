      today was horrible, i was hoping to go to student life 101 for so long but i just had to get the stomach flu!!! I still went but i felt lousy all day and i couldnt pay too much attnetion to the presenstations. i was puking and going to the washroom every 45 mins and i had diarrhea :/ . as always just my luck. i did get to see the campus again though, however i didnt take the tour of st jeromes. I picked up my watcard and calculus textbook and my picture looks like a mugshot, perfect :D. hopefully the same wont happen later when i move into st jerome's

      Its getting so close!!!  Alright i finallly have everything set out and soon im going to go out and start buying everything i need and calling up adam to help me out with building this beast of a machine( alright im exgerating but compared to this crap of a machine i have had to deal with for the last 5 years almost this new computer is a BEAST). Its about time I get this computer, right now the main reason for getting it though is univeristy, i hope i can set aside sometime while im at waterloo to play some games like HL2. Marcus and adam both helped me out in picking out parts, in some areas I had to cut some of the parts recommended for a part one step under to save some money. I soon realized i really couldnt afford an ati x800 pro..... well this will be the guts of my new rig:   Case: Antec PLUS1080AMG Metallic w/430W CPU: Pentium4 3.0  DVD BURNER: NEC 2510 (black) CdRom: LG 52x cd rom  HardDrive: Seagate 120GB 7200RPM w/8MB cache  Memory(ram):  512MB PC3200 DDR400 CAS2(OCZ400512EL)  KeyBoard: Logitech Elite keyboard  Mouse: Logitech mx510, Monitor: LG FLATRON F700B 17 inch   MotherBoard: ASUS P4C800-DLX Intel 875P  VideoCard: ATI Radeon 9800 Pro 128MB DDR SoundCard: Auidgy 2 Platnium  Sound: SennHeiser PC150 Headset   Last time i talked to marcus i realized i missed out on an amazing deal!!! $50 off the ati radeon 9800 at futureshop and best buy, well i made sure that wouldn't happen again. I made sure i was on their price watch. Although I havent been able to get the same deal again I was notified though that the mouse i wanted the mx510 which i would think is more of a luxury than a necessity is down $20 this week at future shop now its less than what marcus spent on his mx500 :)

      So after typing a massive blog just a few mintues ago, I just had to accidently delete my whole blog!!!!!! dammit  Alright so now i have to start over.....  on the issue of whether or not i would rather have flexibility or expandability i choose flexibiliy (although now it doesnt matter since it is very unlikely i get that question again in my profile) i couldnt post my whole reasoning in my profile since it only allows 150 characters in the answer, how ironic :S. but heres my reasoning    i choose to be flexible since in life you can expand as much as you want and never be happy, you can make your business as big as possible with as much stock as you want and never make a profit or gain happiness through the riches you acquire. On the other hand if your flexbile to adjust yourself and your plans to what you think will make you happy, you can bend over backwards and help others and feel satisfied that you have done something good for them. You can work but not allow your job to take a handle and enjoy your life....  My previos reasoning was much better than this, I just cannot remember what i said before and im no longer really in the mood to argue the issue. maybe if someone comes around and comments on this I can gain some ideas and give a stronger support to my answer....
