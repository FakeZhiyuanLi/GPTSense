      the blog about hats has created only more questions  what is the plural of moose?  applying normal english techniques would suggest mooses but it doesnt seem right to me  if however we look for a precedent of a similar word we find goose which changes to geese  so does moose = meese?  or even the more mystical meeses?  or it may even take after the sheep which in plural is unimaginatively called sheep  this truly is a predicament.

      hats.  hats!  hats?  when it is cold, keep warm. understandable  when it is sunny, keep the sun out of your precious little face.  understandable  wearing hats all year round? wearing very thin hats in winter? very thick hats in summer?  it would seem that some people enjoy the novelty affect a hat has on the silhouette of their head  or maybe use the hat for storing things, maybe pennies, or more sinister things like animals, medecines, or smaller hats  maybe on a day when your hair simply refuses to believe in gravity and will defy even the mightiest of gels/mooses (whats the plural of moose?)/waxes it would be suitable, even inginuitive to wear a hat.  but wearing a cap all year round seems to lack creativity, and i have learnt from experience it also indicates stupidity and unparalled agression in the wearer.  hats may be a source of power  this can be proven by stealing the hat from a lifelong hat wearer and shouting "i have their powersource" and taunting them with it.  nothing irritates them more.  until you urinate on the hat.  maybe the unique appearance a hat gives you makes you stand out in a way that seems to scream "look at me, i have a spectacular hat, be my friend, but dont get too close, i can be angry too"  there is little greater than the desire to put something on our heads e.g. hats, rugs and pants

      What’s wrong with having pennies of the windowsill?  Nothing. Exactly  I find that I am given pennies from buying things that cos £X.99.   they are annoying, and too many of them are heavy and they take up space that could be taken up by more valuable tender.  I don’t have any valuable tender but I might get some and don’t want to give it to a cat as my wallet is full of pennies  So where do you put them.  I used to throw them out of the window onto a forest area with the idea that some exceedingly dull future person with a metal detector would get some excitement out of finding it, and the find would make him more dull as he added it to “the pile” of pennies and tennis balls that reside in the forest area.  Or at least a pigeon might choke on it  But then I discovered that the windowsill was about 10 cm by 150 cm of wasted space.  You couldn’t store a car in this area, or even an enchanting hat, but other things would fit.  Paper work would get soggy and blow away, a pet cat has already been tried on the windowsill: it fell off.  Pennies wouldn’t blow away though and if they get a bit rusty, I don’t care.  In fact I want to hand over pennies that although have a date of only 2002 on them, are rusty, green, and look diseased.  It was perfect and although I may never actually spend these pennies (no not that metaphor), whenever I am looking for something to talk about, I can stare the person deep into the eyes and say “I store pennies on my windowsill” and they will think I am very wise.  Probably.  Actually, looking at them now, I can see that I need to turn them, they are only rusted on one side.  Although maybe that is better, even more mystifying to a cashier to have half shiny, half green pennies handed to them.  Upon seeing this they may think I am very wise and will maybe wish to hand the money back in awe of what I have achieved.  Maybe if I cleaned up some old pennies and added them to then rusty new pennies I could claim I was a time traveller, then maybe if I claimed to be looking for sarah connor they might give me a motorcycle.  Anyway, I think they need some salt.

      Man united are worth hating because  1) they rejected the FA cup to play in a more financially rewarding competition, only to go out first round, come back and claim that that years FA cup was pointless cos they weren’t in it  2) peter kenyon is trying to get the FA to allow them to play on Saturdays at 3pm to allow for more televised games.  Despite the fact that this would ruin all smaller clubs who would see gate sales drop, reducing their already precarious finances.  3) alex ferguson using the media to try to win games by undermining the opposition.  4) The glory hunting fans from oxford, bath and singapore who support the club for no other reason than cos they know they will win i.e. my friend supports united cos his mum does, she supports it cos she fancied george best.  Therefore he supports them for no other reason than george best’s thighs  5) Being the first club to go PLC and so being the club that changed football from a sport to hard cash.  So liverpool get money to improve the club and become great, united get money to please the shareholders, improving the squad and being entertaining are second to this  6) Due to the top 5 points they will be responsible for the demise of football.  7) Due to the demise of football, the popularity of rugby will rise  8) Rupert murdoch owns a considerable amount of their club.  Murdoch also drove football towards becoming business by creating the premiership, forcing people to pay £40 a month to see a few football games.  Murdoch also owns The Sun newspaper, responsible for getting the case against the policemen who caused the hillsborough disaster destroyed by writing about all the evidence just to make money.  The policemen where therefore allowed to go free.  9) Alex ferguson owns a horse. What does he do with the horse? Why does he (ferguson) drink so much whiskey?  Does the horse approve of the whiskey? If the horse loses a race, will it get a horseshoe kicked at it with breathtaking force?  Will the horse be going to madrid?  10) Childish arguments of united supporters i.e. owen is no good for england

      fear lothing and despair  not words usually associated with hippies  words better associated with hippies are drugs, vegetables and smell  but this is no ordinary hippy, this is one that tries to hide his dark abnormal background  he was schooled at home until he was 12 when his parents decided that it was an important part of socialisation that he should meet other children of his own age.  so he was thrown into the biggest school in the area.   my school  now a person who has been home schooled has not had the 15 years of knocks to confidence and deals with twats of school that make us all the confidence lacking, realistic, stressed people that we all are. that we all anjoy being as it not only helps you develop a sense of humour very quickly but also edges you right to the boundaries of sanity and keeps us there so that we can actually look at life and laugh at it.  but of course he was not.  he was very confident, talkative, happy and had no sense of how not to embarrass himself  underneath that though he was nice enough. he still would occasionally reveal a darker side. sometimes he would have an odd badge that he wouldnt talk about or he would suddenly be friends with someone who he had never spoken to before in school. i didnt really pay attention to this though really  i will never forget the time when he insisted on singing at me in the middle of the highstreet to demostrate the tune to his then favourite song.  i had to walk faster in a hope that he would get out of breath and have to stop through a sudden asthma attack  the real disturbing nature of (lets call him dominic for now) was only revealed though when i went to his house.  you see, as he lived right out in the country when i was seeing him every day at school there was no point in me going round his house as it would take some time and vice versa.  when he left the school though 2 years later through finding it too stressful, we swapped phone numbers and I thought that we would eventually lose touch and he would always just be a weird person I once met who I could write blogs about when bored.  He gave me, as you can probably tell, a great deal to write about.  He lived in the countryside on a hill that had a small but fairly busy country road alongside it. Anyway, I was at his house but it wasn’t his house: there were a number of different people, and even another family living under the one roof.  This wasn’t even a very big house.  I thought that he had a large amount of lodgers but hey, that’s his life.   The longer I stayed there though, the more I thought that it was more of a collective than having some lodgers due to the freedom that they all had in the house i.e. no rooms designated to different people just a house with lots of people there.  But I still just accepted it.  He owned a field: that was cool  At one point he left me in the hall whilst he talked to his mum, along one side he had it covered in photos, so I looked at a few: the normal family shots.  But then my eye fell on one that has scarred me to this day.   It is a beautiful sunset, he is sitting at the bottom of the field on a gate and his brother is sat next to him with back to camera facing the sunset.  Normal ? Not when you are naked.  Not when you and your brother are absolutely bollock naked sitting on a fence in a field that has a road alongside it. Not on a hill.  HOW? WHY? WAS IT A BET? IS IT SOMETHING MORE SINISTER? IS HE DEMENTED? COULD THAT JUST HAPPEN BY ACCIDENT?    HES 15, TEENAGERS DON’T DO THAT, 4 YEAR OLDS DON’T DO THAT.  PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE CAMERAS ABOUT.  I was scared. Panicky even. Was I, at any moment, going to be invited to join them and their perverted fun? Was I going to be cut up into tiny pieces and used to grit the roads?  What do you do?  What do you do when he then invites you to a Christmas disco at a youth club, knowing that due to his lack of social skills if you decline he wont accept it but keep trying to persuade you and work out a way for you to be able to be there.  i agreed. i thought that at least it would be a youth club with lots of people who might be fun and may be equally scared of him.  but this was of course assuming it was a YOUTH CLUB, a club for any youths that councils set up to stop us burning things.  but no, it was a an organisation youth club i.e. like cubs, scouts, young badgers of westminster etc.  more specifically it was a club full of people like him  my biggest problem with it was that upon arriving and being met with teenagers, happy to see me, shaking my hand and hugging me, they all formed a circle put their hand in the air and started chanting something along the lines of being related to trees and being full of love.  then leaflets were shoved into my hand about the "club" which bore the logo that "dominic" had refused to speak about.  it was called "the woodcraft folk" or woodies for short. no one else seemed to understand what that is a double entendre for.  suddenly it struck me: the happiness, the joy, the nakedness, IT WAS A CULT.  was i going to be cut up into tiny pieces and used to grit the roads? was tonight the night of the ceremonial killing  the disco kicked off, i sat at the back scared.  do you know the music from blade at the underground club at the beginning? and when it gets to the climax the blood pores from the sprinkler system and they are all vampires. shock horror.  that exact song was played after about an hour, and looking up i could clearly see a prinkler system  i headed for the door.  it turns out it is just a youth club of deeply evil people  if by any chance you are in the woodcraft folk or founded it or something, no offence, but you really dont represent the nations youths and are a bit scary, particularly when someone arrives expecting a youth club and finds a collection of bizarre characters who  - from the chant you did - are closely related to trees.  we didnt keep in good contact after that  but there is an even worse side to "dominic" - whenever anyone, months after i last contacted him would say "i wonder what dominic is doing" that very day i would see him. and just seeing him really scares me.  yesterday i was in a restaurant and i thought i saw him coming into a restaurant: i almost choked, broke into a cold sweat and started shaking  even worse i keep hearing things about him, he apparently spent 9 months in spain, has been riding a unicycle round town, went to circus camp to learn to eat fire and maybe will be going to sixth form and doing his exams at my school in the near future.  i dont know what i will do to get over my phobia if this is true.  although i hear good things about cianide

      AHA coffee now safely recovered i recall another irritation of charitable life  maybe this is common place but with me being from a little sneeze of a town in england the antics of charity reps in Bimingham made be convinced i was robbed  firstly, the biggest bloke i have ever seen stops us on the highstreet.  i shat myself.  mark shat himself. "hey were are you going in such a hurry, slow down" - some of the more sinister words a 6 foot 8 body builder can tell you ( just in between "where the f**k is my adrenaline injection" and "get out of my house").  he then explained that he was selling these tiny book things full of "cool" stuff for a charity called something like "happysmile" or something and that we could buy one of the very thin, fading, cheap booklets for just £2.  which was in my judgement around £1.99 more than it cost to make.  we were both obviously very willing to buy his book  upon close inspection we discovered that the charity had one of the worst logos of any charity ever ( a clipart smiley face) and the picture of the wheelchair they were buying looked like it had been one of da vincis rejected inventions.  oh well, we had been conned, he was probably off buying energy drinks as we spoke.  we felt conned anyway.  however about an hour later this guy was still on the highstreet getting more people to "buy my book" so we began to think that maybe we had given money to an actualy charity.  surprisingly the charity is actually registered and whats more, the book was full of the most hilariously tragic poetry sent in buy other buyers of the book ( mostly teenagers like us)  i almost felt inclined to send in some of my own ridiculous poetry about pretending to be depressed. maybe with a subtext of buying a shitty book of a body builder but that is always hard to try to slyly filter in.  for one nothing rhymes with builder.  i wonder if the charity ever realised that it only ever got sent depressing poetry cos everyone who bought the book felt conned out of £2

      why do people insist on asking for money for the bus. more specifically, why do they ask me?  Living where i do ( oh yes i have learnt not to give away details on the net, not again) missing the bus is hardly the disaster made out by these little bastards.  "excuse me mate, can i have 50p for the bus i havent got any money"  1) if the fare costs 50p then its only going to be about a mile and as you are - most likely to be -  a young male than its not going to be that bad  2) Its spring: the walk will be nice  3) why are you asking me whilst walking away from the bus station?  4)  why are you only asking me?  5) why arent you doing a dance to earn my money?  Some people may accuse me of being a bit sceptical (paticularly anyone who has tried to convince me of the existence of pens) but by giving them money we are assuming a lot  the fact that they got to town without getting a return ticket on the bus is pretty laughable anyway, particularly as they would probably be planning to return at some point.  But admittedly they could have been left in town after being given a lift in or something.  Even so, unless they have the genes of a rabbit they would have foreseen the need to get home on the bus in the future and so any normal person would have made sure that they had that money left from their activities in town, if they have forgotten to do that, then they deserve to walk and for myxamitosis to destroy their bunny lives.  Even if i had done that,  i wouldnt go round asking people to fund my trip home.  Admittedly, disaster could have struck and they could have been mugged or something but in that case, surely the police would be a better option than a bus  nevertheless whenever i am asked whether i can afford their bus ticket i will continue to use the same response " i am sorry ive forgotten my wallet today" despite all this going through my head.  i will probably never tell one to go and shove a bus into their eye, or enquire as to exactly why they are asking me and why the want to live like this, or whether they will fund the operation i will need on my hand when i give them a slap.  because that is what being british is all about. pretending to be naive but inwardly hating the universe and wishing to violently hurt many of the people who surround you.  In britain even criminals receive a polite decline of their offer of taking your money free of charge.    now, where did i put that coffee?

      hes been sick for an entire week now.  only ME sufferers are ill for that long.  this is one of my friends by the way.  he hasnt replied to emails either so maybe it is ME, and if it is, good luck to him.  exam revision is a bit annoying as i havent done any yet.  could do some this bank holiday cos its going to rain all weekend, but..... no  tonight is the night of the final year prom, which i am very proud to not be a part of as:  1) at £25 i could have my own prom, with hats and everything  2) the commitee have decided on the spectacularly confused idea of a black tie disco ??  3) over half the girls in our school  -upon hearing on wednesday that some girls were going to get tans done- bought very cheap fake tan and now look more orange than a frustrated umpalumpa   4) £25 + hiring/buying a suit has meant that some have spent over £100 on this night only for their dates to turn up with a skin tone several shades higher than is healthy  5) it is being policed by every available teacher about. much better to go to the sixth form one in 2 years when alcohol and nightclubs are available  Going to alton towers on the last day will be good anyway

      as i have finished all my exams i have decided to write a song about how i feel  "I have done all my exams im quite happy with 10 weeks off if you have to work during the summer all i can do is look sympathetic, of course, im not sympathetic, i have a big holiday and you dont sorry  and all the exams went really well so i think i will pass so no panicking for me, oh no and i get to pick up my friends results so i can lie to him about them down the phone whilst he hates a holiday in a caravan in somerset i can watch all of wimbledon and enjoy henman losing  no football though arse"  so i'm quite satisfied really

      the eternal problem with messenger is that people can speak to you eventhough you dont want to ever be contacted by them ever ever.  you can appear offline but not immediately meaning that the person can see you come online then hide.  you could block them but im too nice as you can probably tell.  one boring day, i put dominics name into google to see if there was maybe a club i could join, or maybe a forum for people adversly affected by the woodcraft folk.  anyway there was a forum for "woody 98". i laughed.  but it turns out it was for a camping thing and one of the posts was from a dominic h*****.  so i had his email adress.  i suppose when the councilling started they might want me to contact him and "express" myself  after that, whenever the old "i thought it was a cult" story was told to anyone who asked "have you heard from dominic lately?" i was inevitably told to contact him.  if i had it would only have opened the doors for more meetings where he would sing at me so i always refused their offers of money.  last friday when i go online, i see that mark is online and so i speak to him  "mark: i cant believe you are online, guess who i am speaking to  me:    zoe ball?  mark: no, try again  me:    i bet its dominic  mark: YES   me:    i knew you would do that. you are such a gimp  mark: he says he isnt coming to our school for sixth form  me:    thank god  mark: i'll invite him in  mike is offline"  next i get a popup saying that "domo" has added you to his list of contacts, do you accept?  i had to click yes now, it was suspicious enough for me to suddenly leave like that and although it is very easy to blam microsoft making my computer crash, that excuse wouldnt wrok for ever (well it might)  mark was enjoying himself: he could smell my suffering, he knew the stories that dominic didnt even know existed, he knew that at some point i would have to speak to him.  I downloaded a hacked version of messenger that lets me log on automatically as offline so i can see who is about and log on if it's clear.   i still havent spoken to him, partly because he isnt online that much (hooray) and that when he was i hid.  what mark doesnt know though is that when i do speak to him it will be entirely civilised and that if i get dragged into any more meetings with him mark is involved now. hes coming too.  the transcript of any conversation will be up here when its been done.  and if he should ask for it he would get marks phone number, address and be fed lies about how mark is very concerned with the environment and yet feels that he doesnt want to join the militarist boys brigade.  on the upside if i got a virus it would now get to him too

      alexei sayle agrees with me:  "the woodcraft folk is a youth organisation set up in the 1930s by various left-wing fabian organisations of the day to counteract the militarist/fascist tendencies of the boy scouts, girl guides and the boys brigade.  They formed a sort of paramilitary wing of the Co-op and it was easy enough for alices mum to contrive a camping accident that put her best friend in a sanatorium for six months"

      murdoch is a tosser  i have been getting free digital channels to a digibox (cost £70) for under a year  and murdoch has decided that i should pay for my free channels  leaving me with the bbc and some radio, which is very nice, but is less than i would get with analogue.  i could just switch to analogue, and then if i need to watch bbc3 or something i can plug everything back in but that is going to be a lot of hassle to channel surf  arse  what i could do, is sell the digibox on ebay and use that money to get a freeview box, which i will then shove into murdoch's eye.  he is probably sitting in his office right now, laughing and shouting and he is probably juggling remote controls, giggling, screaming "the media is mine, they must all pay for free things, the stupid media whores"  murdoch is never getting a penny from me.  my life is devoted to depriving him of my money: i shall buy The Guardian and The Mirror, never pay to see man united (wasnt going to anyway) and i will only watch new episodes of buffy on other peoples tv's.

      there are some things you can buy that are bargains  today, for instance, i got hold of the thrills' new album, a copy of "join me" by danny wallace, "the shawshank redemption" and "one flew over the cuckoos nest" on dvd for only £30  it is quite hard to get bargains for food though, particularly at small spa-type shops who cant afford to do any good offers  i only mention this as i have spent the last week on holiday with my friend (mark shall remain nameless throughout this) who likes his bargains.  so much so that when he went shopping he spent a whopping £3 and in his buys were 8 "burgers" for 99p and some sausages that tasted like chicken.  in order to avoid buying a sauce for pasta he invented the dish "pasta, sausage, bacon, butter" and it took him some time to decide whether or not he should spend £5 on a kite.  he did and it was rubbish.  anway, i cant go to town anymore.  no not another anti social behaviour order, but people keep asking me for things in shops.  well 2 people have asked me for things in shops, but that's happened the last 2 times i have been to town which is really 100%.  do i really give off a vibe of bored-at-work-want-you-to-ask-me-questions?  i wouldnt mind if it was a gym, or somewhere i actually have worked: i didnt mind it when people asked me questions in argos cos i would have got fired if i had told them to go and insert things into themselves.  i have been asked about some prune pills in one of those health shop places which just made me want to rip out my own sense of intrigue and wonder why i look like one of the dozy long haired new age folk in the shop.  also today a welshman approached me and asked if i had any welsh shirts to which i could only look startled until i realized who he thought i was.  so in order to stop this happening to me in public i have decided to get a job so that customers can get out all of their curiosity as to what we sell when i am actually being paid for it.  so, application one to starbucks as i figure that it cant be so hard to make coffee and apparently it is a good place to work.  and there is the added benefit of all the ladies college girls going there to get their hit of caffeine.  when i get fired from there, i could try ottakers: i like books, and they get a similar amount of expensively educated pretty little things.

      well i said i was nervous about exam results and i got them last thursday.  i got (ahem) 8 A*s, 2As and a D in electronics  so not too bad then  but this means its now much more unlikely for me to get a job: it was bad enough at argos where it was obvious the staff were more intelligent than the boss but having a piece of paper to prove it isnt going to help other employers to give me a job.  *shrug*

My latest attempt is to to get a job being an usher at the theatre.  not the most exciting place i know, but apparently you get paid for showing people in, waiting round till the show finishes, then watching them leave, which sounds good to me.

      football season starts tomorrow.  hooray.  got to play chelsea first though which is always crap anyway, but with their new suspicious russian money injection replacing the suspicious evil santa they might try quite hard to win, otherwise their 75 million might look a little bit wasted.  ive just come back from dublin where i was on holiday for a week with family.  *sigh*.  dublin is a nice place, just with family you can never really do the fun things that you would do if you were their with friends  GCSE results out next wednesday: even though i shouldnt be nervous, i do feel a bit excited.  I think the fact that i keep having dreams where i have to take more GCSEs without any warning must say something about what i feel, although apparently people still have dreams like this when they are much older, such as the brilliant comic/writer, richard herring (link below)  i was caught by dominic online the other day so i had to speak to him, but to make sure i didnt go mental at him, mark joined the conversation and abused him for me.  apparently the smug git is doing exams in practically any order he can think of, so in total i think he will have done 4 A-levels and 4 GCSEs by next year.  we can only hope then that he will go to uni a year early and end up killing himself or going mental like most people do who go early or go with bizarre social skills.  All i know though is that he uses words like "bummer" when you tell him something bad and "hehe" instead of lol, so to me that is reason enough to still feel hatred tinged with fear.

      hardest a-levels:  1) physics 2) chemistry 3) maths 4) biology  (source The Guardian 2003)  my subjects:  1) physics 2) chemistry 3) maths 4) biology   WOOPS  they are ok - so far  righty right then... what has happened... saved 14gb of info using my incredible lateral thinking and IT skills, got drunk: woke up with a hat (not mine), developed a blank/confused/stoned expression due to all the mind bending stuff i get told everyday at sixth form, learn to drive soon (nyaw haw haw haw), started going to wing chun kuen self defence classes, etc  ahhh this blog is getting shitter: cant do anything creative any more, doing constant maths and facts and stuff has destroyed my mind  hahahahahahaha i know something that is fascinating that i am sure you will all find really intriguing and splendid  there was this trani-badger in my school who was a bit of a twat.  now he has left school and works full time in MCDONALDS  hahahahahahhahahahahahshduiaopewirnsepifjnsr'gopeirnjgpfnpeks negmsd;fgvposjr/lvksdnvl[wrigjno[ijn cough  i'm sure something really interesting has happened to me but i cant quite think of it.  hmm.  have to give that some though.  i went out to the "vanfest" (i put it in speech marks to show my distain for it) to get pissed and i spent most of the night screaming abuse at the crap band they had on but they couldnt here me cos they were too busy doing a heavy house version of hot chocolate (yeah tell me about it) then i found a hat, lost my bottle opener but later found out it was because i hadnt put it in my pocket as i had thought but tucked it into my pants (hygiene?) and somehow picked up a desire to drive which i can soon (nyaw haw haw haw haw).  i also developed a skill for dancing in a rather silly style which i believe is invaluable for the student years to come.  need money though, and dont have time for a job which is a slight problem.  unless any of you want to employ me as a blog writer/music listener/writer of crap/ writer/slob/drunken fool/student-ish/blankfaceman/abuse shouter/driver (nyaw haw haw haw)  anyway. enough. i'm going. had enough of you faking interest. gonna get me a spoon. dont look like that. i like spoons. go on, piss off.  i dont want you here, i dont even like you. i dont even know you, unless i do.  i think therefore i am, problem comes when you are braindead. watching university challenge whilst listening to music, now thats multi-tasking. no, its not called doing 2 things badly.  oi, just get back in your pimp-mobile and leave.  good, thats better.

      why am i doing sciences and maths.  i think in technical terms, doing those subjects after doing so well in gcses is called "setting yourself up for a big fall"  they are hard and boring.  anyway  seeing dave gormans at the everyman next tuesday which should be very "proper bo" "sorted" and all the other words.  have to miss the "icebreaker" party at time nightclub which is a bit crap but there wasnt any alcohol around anyway and nightclubs dont have the same feel when you dont feel sick.  ugh, cant be bothered  going

      back  sort of gave up on this but, well, here i am  it turns out the side affects of doing 3 sciences and maths is lots of nosebleeds.  they might be the side affects of the cold i have had for ages but thats just stupid.  i imagine it has something to do with my brain trying to excape from my head so it doesnt have to deal with any more titrations.  do you think that someone who starts text messages with "dear ***" and ends them "from ***" is dangerous?  i have thought about this a lot as i am worried about the fact that something about me might attract a domo mk2 and this might be one of the signs that lead to scary friends.  lets face it, sending texts like that is already scary, it could only be made more intimidating if the bulk of the message was "I AM OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE WITH A HAMMER" or even "LOOK HOW MANY MICE I CAN FIT INTO MY MOUSE HOLE!!!" but at least that would be honest.  He's invited everyone to the cinema to see lord of the rings but decided he would book the 8pm sunday performance cos he thought no one would be busy then.  he's is right, no once is doing anything then because NO ONE WANTS TO BE DOING ANYTHING.  so i am going to see lord of the rings with the sort of people who will probably dress up as gandalf, on sunday night, to see a fantasy film, with me having nosebleeds.  maybe im turning into one of them: i feel dirty, need to get drunk very quickly.  "cress, too tempting even for jesus"  anyway, i would write merry christmas but frankly i'd rather you didnt have one.  i know the sort of people who read these things, cant even write their own so have to read someone elses.  probably reading this on a sunny day, look at yourself. LOOK HARD.

      got broadband now, so i can ignore my blog even more by looking at videos of men playing beethoven on car horns  happy new year? we all know the answer to that one  nothing has changed.  no job, sixth form is quite hard, i speak to scary people on a regular basis, liverpool are underperforming and the most exciting thing to happen here today is that a horse may or may not jump over a fence depending on the mentality of the midget sat on it.  No ones giving me an award.  Someone young goes to a few gigs and you cant award him enough, i sit here listening to old radiohead albums and get completely ignored.  hypocrites.  Dont you feel sorry for him having to write a media studies essay, whilst i'm stuck here trying to draw Transchloroethyne  just cos he manages to blog a few times a week and i can barely type long enough to make some half arsed attempt to make my life sound interesting once a month.  Maybe i'll start going to a few gigs here in gloucestershire: i hear The Wurzels are playing in the local barn.  Is that what you want? an in depth discussion on how making the stage out of hay was genius? No, exactly, so dont make me.  Im sure he finds plenty of time inbetween talking about films and trying to touch ryan adams to do his blog, i have sitting down to do, not to mention all that "work" on the xbox.  What kind of a hat-wearing Nathan Barley spends all his time with friends going out and having fun?  All i'm asking is for an award to go to the bloggers who truly suffer for their art and are afflicted with the terrible diseases of lazyness and greed.

      half term was a bit boring.  had to do loads of work.  and although i was going to write something interesting it seems that doing all that work has turned my imagination to mush.  so i wont write anything much.  typed this address into google and found my page and a page that sold tickets to sports events in america linking to it for some reason.  have no idea why, and couldnt find the link on their site.  so dont know if that means someone reads it, or someone just typed in the wrong address somewhere.  ?????

      Results were mostly good, not great, B's mostly.  but i have to get A's so its time to crank it up to 11.  Although it might be better to crank it up to 4 first and then see what happens.  tempting to just go mental for a month and try really really hard to do everything really well and do loads of extra work just to see if i would destroy the universe because thats what i imagine would happen, i am phenomally clever already :)  do you have a sign in your room saying "danger crocodiles"? no, see how clever i am.  There arent any crocodiles in my room, but having the sign merely highlights the fact that there arent any crocodiles which only instills awe in people.  If there was a crocodile then having a sign above stating that there was such a cold blooded reptile about would just be silly, not helpful.  But there arent any so it is ok.  some people might say that having a crocodile sign where there werent any was just being unhelpful and was designed purely to play with their emotions like an epileptic playing the spoons.  But i would claim that they are a bit of a wazzock for even thinking that a crocodile would fit into, never mind forge the sort of secret den that a sign would merit, in my room.  i also have a piece of paper where i have cunningly written "Rupert murdoch smells of wee".  The world is mine.

      The pedantic among you may have realised that this post is not long after the previous one.  good.  Cant get the comment things to work so i'll give you an email adress shortly which you can send to.  No one will, no one reads this but just in case.  And dont send me crap cos it will just be a yahoo account and i will delete it and then bury my computer deep underground where your electronic space signals cant hurt it. my precious.  Thinking about getting a proper web page that i can design properly and put some interesting stuff on apart from this torrent of drivel about mathematical clapping.  Reading from the unspeakable "well awarded by the guardian newspaper" ones blog i see he is going to new york now.  with his mates.    .......just....... *sigh*....... ....    . . . Ignore him.  Everyone, please abandon his blog for a week to teach him not to be such a lucky little bastard.  I think its great that he has such a good time, just dont write down how good a time it is and get people to read it and award you for having more interesting things to write than them.  Just dont go there any more, ever.  Thats how the revolution will start. maybe.  if there is one.  I dont really want one or anything, i'm just saying that ignoring people might start it.  heres a link to it so you can all appreciate him.   urlLink matt munton

      started driving lessons on saturday so i can give you some tips:  1) the accelerator doesnt accelerate.  Well it does actually, but i prefer to call it the "magic rev increasing device of doom" which is pretty self explanatory.  2) If you flash your lights, everyone thinks you mean them.  So if you do it at a busy junction you can make people walk into oncoming traffic  3) the reverse is now the "make sure its dead pedal"  thats about it for now.  next lesson on sat.  so stay off the roads!!!!!!!!!!.  you dont actually have to,  the probability of me managing to run over everyone in the whole world who is on a road is quite small.  Its quite unlikely i will hit or hurt anyone really.  Im really a very good driver.  The joke everyone makes about staying off the roads is actually a not very funny cliche about killing people by accelerating a ton of metal into them.  do you see?  got 1.5 days to revise for maths now.  Sounds a lot of time but maths is actually 3 subjects cunningly weaved into one on the basis that they all involve maths.  Physics only narrowly escaped being maths, it wasnt going to have a name but was to be referred to by a series of claps.  Stats, pure, mechanics and clapclapclap was the plan.  it never happened though because the inventer fell off a bridge precisely 0.4 seconds after he thought of it.  He should have looked where he was going instead of thinking about a fibbonacci sequence of claps that he could use to ensnare the maths bits of chemistry into his sordid mathematical hell.

      Doing mocks.  ...  silly me only forgot what an electophile was.  Dont i feel stupid.  But it seems to me that if pedophiles are attracted to kiddies, then electrophiles must be attracted to electrons.  Probably wrong but it made me laugh.  Surprisingly there are no gigs in my local area for some time and with no decent way to get to any big cities (or the land of the magic witch carriage as they are known here) i dont think i'll be going to any soon.  Sorry to disappoint but the only gigs going on here are when mad derek starts dancing, pisses himself then goes home.  Its practically Glastonbury.  Mad Derek does actually exist by the way.  He pushes his lawnmower round town.  Every day.  He likes nothing better than to go into somerfield, giggle then piss himself.  The urban myth is that a friend of a friend ended up with derek pouring meths over them and trying to light them.  Whats black and white and eats like a horse? a zebra  ugugug

      richard herring was good  so have that.  Ahahahaha.  when i looked at this american sports web page that seemed to link to me,  it turned out there is some american sports player called mmcevoy and they thought that he had clearly had a monumental breakdown and was now convinced he was a 17 year old living in hobbit country.  If you are reading this thinking that i am in fact a sports star, then of course, i AM him.  I remember winning all those really important things in the sport i play/played.  All this crap about maths, crocodiles and windowsills is just a clever ruse to persuade rival sportsmen not to read it.  well done on recognising that i really am him.  Therefore you are all invited to my house, wherever that may be.  Why dont you look on the internet to find where i play, chances are i will live nearby and then ask the locals for directions: just tell them that you are mr mcevoys very close internet friend and you would like to touch his beard.  If you get to MY house, dont be stopped just because i dont answer the door, check round the back, or climb through a window to meet me: its not breaking and entering if i invited you and i am inviting you.  When the police ask you what you were doing just tell them that a particularly charming goblin told you to.  Always blame those dirty goblins.  If you came here looking for alan titchmarshes spring gardening tips you are also in the wrong place.  Fi you want to know mr titchmarsh's top tips, i suggest you also take the above action.  Of course you may just be here for fun, but thats just ridiculous cos only 2 people have done that in the past 3 weeks you lazy weasle eating cranberries.

      my brother recieved a letter from a solicitors in manchester the other day, telling him the story of this man who was in a taxi that crashed.  He was quite badly injured and unfortunately for the guy he is suing, was very near becoming a professional golfer.  They want my brother to go to court and give evidence saying that yes this man was good enough to be a pro golfer but since the accident wont be able to play any more.  The problem being though is that my brother plays golf like a cacti. so why do they want him? Because my brother shares his name with an ex pro golfer who now lives in gloucestershire.    Just to add another dimension of weirdness to this: my brother was also in a taxi, that crashed, in manchester.  There is also a film about a golfer with the same name (although not based on the real pro golfer).  So now there are 3 people with the same name:  two are golfers, the other is an embarrassment to the non golfing community  one is fiction, two are real,   one lives in gloucestershire, one spends half his time in gloucestershire and manchester and one lives in manchester  The non golfing slack-jawed idiot is being asked to testify about a golfer who was been in the same accident as he has, in the same vehicle, in manchester.    But if you knew pete, you would realise just how much things like this happen to him

      snowsnowsnowsnowsnowsnowsnowSNOW!  its snowing.  Its snowing in what might be the most depressing way ever: about 5 flakes have drifted down onto my windowsill and now it seems to have stopped.  yep, it's stopped.   So anyway it turns out that not only are we all made of mostly nothing but the stuff that isnt nothing is both a wave and a particle whilst being neither.  However it is always energy and when the particles move they tend to behave as waves whilst still being particles, but the faster they go they get more mass because of relativity, however they might be waves and therefore have zero mass to begin with.   And schroedringer didnt like cats much because his has been alive and dead for about 30 years.  In other news, the square root of minus one doesnt exist.  However the square of the square root of minus one (something that doesnt exist) is 1.  So now nothing squared is 1 and buildings are both 100 and -100 metres tall whilst being entirely composed of complete nothingness and some little things that cant quite make up their minds if they are there or not and what exactly they should be.  But lets not forget that if you were to actually measure any of this happening you would change the results and therefore prove that black was white and explode in a logic implosion.  To me this just proves that we know as much about the universe as a particularly stupid duck billed platypus knows about the menu at KFC.

      im in a bit of a random quote mood so heres some stuff.  not telling you where its from because that makes me feel powerful.  all hail my power. ...  "so i said unto the fool, if ye sow wheat what will you reap? "wheat", he replied.  If i sow barley what do i reap? "Barley", the fool replied.  So if you sow hate you will reap hate.  but the fool said "no, because in your example, wheat and barley are seeds and so obey the natural laws of physics.  Hate however is a metaphysical concept and so you cant assume that it will behave in the same manner".  Ah, but it will, i told the fool, and he saw that he was wrong and left."  "honey, im thinking of having that tattooed on my face"  anyway, enough of that.  we are going to rule the world with our new product that we invented whilst talking about the film deliverance, banjos and muhammed ali.  Forget the george foreman multi-grill, thats living in the past, stop living in the past.  The future is the george formby multi-grill with the timeless slogan "turned out nice again".  think about it, you're in a shop, there are two grills in front of you: one by some ex boxer, the other by the greatest window cleaner/banjo players in the history of window cleaning and banjo players since the great window and banjo fire of 1864.    " if you can see what i can see, when im grilling bacon"  ROCK

      organic food  as opposed to all that synthetic stuff we usually eat  i know what its supposed to mean but saying this chicken is better than that one because its organic is like saying steven gerrard is a better footballer than stephen hawking because gerrard has a shorter haircut.  whereas we all know that steven gerrard is a great footballer because he has a special watch.  still no crocodiles in my room and there are no gigs nearby either, apart from the comedians i am going to see.  However i reckon i could solve both problems by finding a particularly talented crocodile or alligator, making it release a record and then forcing it to play every night in gloucestershire whilst staying in my bedroom.  and i could charge it all the rent i wanted as it would be a crocodile and thus have no concept of ownership and currency.  Then when i didnt want it i could sell it to las vegas where it would be made to perform nightly, get very fat and die at a relatively young age in an embarrasing way.  have been watching a few MST3K dvds.  Discovered Manos: The Hands Of Fate which i think is one of the funniest things i have every seen.  If you dont know what MST3K is then you should find out, and buy some dvds from america because of the good exchange rate.    Dont patronise Torgo

      "liverpool have won from a penalty scored by danny murphy"  something i really didnt expect to hear today.  but i'm glad i did.  i know before the game i was saying that the outcome was pretty irrelevant cos both sides have had poor seasons but... we won so now its the most important game ever played of any sport ever in the history of winning things, which we won.

      Oh so suddenly now there has been some mistake and i'm not getting my money.  well you can take your money and feed it to a slightly bigger heron.  decided what i want to do at uni so from now on you can only refer to me as doctor.   even if i dont get in, which is quite likely cos only about 10% of people do.   Rich hall and Mike Wilmot were surprisingly good  "George bush said that this wasnt a religious war, it was "a crusade on terror".  idiot"  "Only the english could come up with a phrase like "surprisingly good" because you expect everything to be terrible all the time, so that when something is actually good, you genuinely are surprised"  but imagine someone saying the above lines so that they are funny and similar lines like them for 2 and a half hours and you can imagine how good it was.  bill bailey in June  woop

      next year i might get paid ?30 a week, just to turn up to sixth form.  free money = beer + being stupid - short term memory  of course i might get this money and put it in a high interest bank account so that when i'm a student it is there and waiting, but being realistic, there's a greater chance of me feeding it to herons than doing that.  Surprisingly there was a heron in our garden once.  i was reading a newspaper and looked up to see a heron take its head out of our pond and then fuck off with our fish.  Then just to rub our noses in it, a few minutes later, i looked up from the paper again to see it flying off with what looked like some pond plants in its beak.  Finally the next day i woke up to find it trying to siphon water out of the bond using a bilge pump and an atlas  one part of the above story was a lie.  can you figure out which bit it is?  Yes, of course the heron didnt steal the plants: what would a heron do with lagoon like flora?    "People do get alzheimers you know"   Dan from school was telling me today about some woman he had seen walking round without any shoes, which reminded me that the day before i had seen the same woman and yes, it was indeed odd.  The person sat next to us: the harry potter wannabe sociopath, rob then said the above phrase in his typical way.  I unwittily replied "Well its not going to be an imaginary disease made up by doctors to make themselves feel good.  is it?"  and he saw that he was wrong and hence i won.    But rob also thinks he is pregnant as long as you apply the freudian idea that whatever people accidentally say must be true.  Just like when you accidentally say par cark you are actually revealing the truth that all car parks actually have a slightly different name in the real language that you must secretly use to yourself.  but maybe if freud had spent a bit more time doing work instead of thinking about cocks and taking cocaine he would have been able to make things like this clear.   so from free money, to herons, to freud in one blog.  put that in your black forest cack search engine and find some psychological deeper meaning you internet witches.

      Own up, who found this page by searching for "black forest cack" on yahoo?  is it the gateaux or the place in germany you find cack-like?   spent saturday playing with knives, poles and defeating wooden dummies which was cool.  Have one hell of a sore arm today though cos the wing chun pole is basically a small tree without the branches and its really heavy.    There's a programme on in a bit about child prodigies: i am going to scoff at them for not having the full rich life that i have.  Yeah they may be able to speak 16 languages but they havent got.... .a.. . . .. fishing licence have they? the poor fools.   I got tricked into buying loads of food yesterday.  I went into a subway sandwich shop (i'm not proud of it, but i was hungry) didnt know what i was doing and so when the woman asked "would you like a larger sandwich" i thought she meant a bit bigger, like they do in other fast food places, but what she actually meant to say was "you know this sandwich you are already ordering, which to be fair is already quite oversized, would you like to double the size of it to the point where it is in fact shocking".  I would have declined that, but instead i had to gorge on a huge amount of bread and salad.   so go and spread the word.  Subway is a large boat full of goat testicles.

      well will you look at that.  it's 2 in the afternoon and i still havent started working.  fascinating.  To the layman it may seem that i am only writing this so that i can leave the mechanics past papers for another half an hour but what i am actually doing is carrying out an in depth sociological experiment so incredibly important and intricate that although i could explain it, a large percentage of the readers would develop nosebleeds and possibly aortic aneurysms*.  I tried explaining it to a tramp once and they were so confused that they completely imploded in on themselves leaving no trace they had ever existed apart from a faint lemony smell.  All i will tell you is that it involves music, jam, an albatross and laughing.  bye bye everyone, bye bye.   *aortic aneurysms are possibly the best way anyone could ever die ever.  ever.  The aorta (big artery from the heart) attaches to the windpipe for support in one area.  If you have high blood pressure the aorta can sort of pop open into the windpipe.  The overall result is that the person will feel a sharp pain before their head flies back and blood fires out of their mouth and about 2 metres in the air.  Who wants to die peacefully when you can die spectacularly.  (amazing: half two already)

      how am i supposed to get any revision done with all these past papers they are making me do.   i know they cunningly think that by giving me them i am revising but i can do all this rubbish and the stuff i dont know i look up in a book, write it down and then forget it.   ug   YAY, our next door neighbours are moving. the same neighbours who played "champagne supernova" by oasis repeatedly, every day, for 4 years. And the same ones who liked singing loudly in their scratchy demented voice to anything by the venga boys late at night for a few years. Yes, they are fun to live next to: i particularly like it when they start shouting abuse at policemen living near by from their garden at 2 in the morning. but they are going and unless the people moving in are untrained monkeys who like throwing their own excrement and listen to white noise at 130 decibels then it cant be much worse.   However we have a long history of weird/dodgy neighbours. The best was a family who had a kid called Christian: he tried to steal my tricycle and when we stole it back and chained it to a ladder he tried to steal it again (he was about 7 years old), also the family were in some deep financial trouble so they told everyone they were moving to new zealand but instead just hid in their house for a few months. The other interesting family were the ones who stole all our tennis balls whenever they landed near their house and before they left went mental at us because our pond had supposedly flooded their garden (the pond was still full of water and so we had to break the news that the reason everything was wet was because it had rained; they werent happy)   wow, i can see that loads (13) people have visited and one person has even RETURNED, hopefully because they liked it and not because they were collecting evidence to file a lawsuite against me for telling people to break into someone elses house.

      i love my stat counter, it tells me loads of things.  My favourite is what people searched for to get to this website heres a few:  "lawsuite bill gates asthma" - yeah, windows crashing is enough to give anyone asthma.  "badger cianide pills" - !!!  honestly, this appeared in my stats.  i'm sure the RSPCA will deal with any badger infestations, theres no need to resort to fecking cianide.  How the hell are you going to give them the pills anyway? try and smuggle them into their food without them noticing? you havent thought this through.   CIANIDE! do you have any idea how unnecessary that is.  If you accidentally ingested some your heart would stop within 30 seconds. its like using a 50 megaton nuclear blast to light a cigarette.  "one ton cack"  - I would say this site was more than a ton of cack.  "mmcevoy blog" - worrying. someone actually tried to track me down.  "bournside school lost virginity" - *shudder* more alarming because the word "virginity" doesnt appear on my site.  Google just sort of assumed. bastards.  "jamie cullem jazz summer school" - i wouldnt bother.  "alexei sayle cack" - he is NOT cack  "crazed wolves in store a bad mistake, admits mothercare" - yep, i did type that  "cack am" - i hate the morning too.  "angry woman golfer clipart" - i think we've all been at that time in our lives when all we really want is a clipart pic of an angry female golfer.  "black forest cack" - i think you mean cake.  its not that hard to spell. honestly.   to think that all bar one of these people wanted to find something and they ended up with my site.  they must have been heartbroken.

      ha.  i didnt fail my theory test.  'ave it.  As i was waiting someone else came in who was about my age, dressed in very expensive clothes and spoke in a really posh way.  The woman asked him if it was his first time taking it and he said it was his third.  aha he is rich and stupid: i mocked him in my mind and he never even knew.  And then i got off the bus aha.  "my expectations where confounded and hence the humour arose"  i think i am arguing with a teacher from my school by the comments on robs blog.  Rob knows when i post so i can basically be as mean as i like and he knows i am only joking (at least thats what he thinks. haha).  Rob told a lot of teachers about his blog so they all think i am being horrible for real and one has been arguing with me.  Admittedly the argument has moved on to whether astronauts could beat up cavemen but its still funny.

      im just really puffin off at the moment and i dont know why.  Possibly the biggest reason is i have to spend 3 hours tomorrow afternoon in a general studies exams writing a load of zeppelin about a subject i only pretend to know anything about only to gain a qualification worth absolutely wilderbeast.  The fact that this annoying little cranberry of a subject is now probably messing up my mechanics revision is making me want to wear a T shirt saying "quack, quack, quack, quack" and beat something to death using a pointy stick.  I'm not quite sure how the goverment managed this, they made all the exams easier yet somehow still managed to keep the stress and even add to it because now all university places are taken before you even get to look at them.  I cant even find any decent music to play.  Actually the only music that would fit my mood would be a guy with glandular fever, screaming and banging a drum.  with his head.  crocodile, crocodile, crocodile.  (this post has been carefully re-edited since its first publication to remove some of the extreme language.  I have cleverly done this be using other words instead of the actual offensive ones.  i bet you hardly even noticed. tractor)

      been playing with the new blogger.  hopefully i can get some comments thing going so all 64 of you who have ever visited can leave me surprises.  Although i dont think the two lithuanian visitors will be too involved.  This rob guy is making his own blog.  It's special.  Here it  urlLink is   Just to make it clear to anyone who went there, he doesnt really have over 1000 hits.  He set it to that to give the illusion of popularity.  Yes, i know this blog isnt exactly popular, but i dont really want people i know to read it so dont tell anyone.  I like the way he is pretending to be someone completely different online, hinting at himself having some sort of fantastic alter ego, whereas he is like that in real life too.  Imagine it if you will.  ah well, i cant exactly complain about other peoples blogs.    I will though because thats the way i am.

      Rob:  i am assuming you have found this web site by now.    hello.  Yeah, you were right, this blog does contain stuff about you.  But despite knowing this you still spent time finding it so if you read some stuff then its really all your fault.  Although it may seem like i have written it and then published it for the people of the world to read, it is in fact, still your fault.  Dont think there is anything on here that refers to you in anything other than your first name anyway.  And not very much of it is that embarrasing to you.  It is not a shadow on your deep seated unhealthy obsession about Ella Corbin of cheltenham bournside school, cheltenham, england, uk.  Neither does it go into any great detail about your hobby of dressing up as a generic wizard for the Harry Potter book launch last summer: a fact made all the more embarrasing due to you being a 16 year old, in town, at midnight, reading a childrens book, alone.   As a general bit of information for rob and all readers: if you havent figured out by now, this blog contains no in depth detail about the life, inner thoughts, or aspirations of mmcevoy.  It's really just something i write, about anything (and as you will find out, absolutely anything).  So to just make that clear to you rob, there is nothing embarrasing about ME here.  It is a different matter for you however.  I understand that some people feel that the whole interest in a blog is the personal touches that mean you can find out someones deepest thoughts and longings when you dont know them at all.  However, as is now apparent due to people i know  finding this site, i'm glad that i always chose not to do that.  It really is suicide.  My blog is fun the way it is anyway.  isnt it?  fun fun FUN.  keep repeating it till its true.

      Jamie Cullem visited our school to give a performance to some randomly chosen students.  I would have gone, but i prefer pure maths to his cumudgeonly sprout like face.  In fact i was fully expecting him to arrive sitting on a piano being pulled by wild dogs through the streets, beating off peasant children with a stick and shouting "when you make an album , then you can touch my piano".  When he did neither of these things i was even more disappointed in him, and this is why i will not be buying his album.

      i've just invented a new game.   based on the idea that stat counters record all on blogs.   type messages to people into search engines so they find it later in their stats e.g. "i find your blog horrific", "i find your blog laughable", "my what a crap blog", "you love your blog and you know you do", "mummy's gone and shes not coming back" etc. (havent dont the last one)(yet)   i enjoy it. although i did feel a bit sorry for the person i found twice on two different searches who now has some startlingly offensive remarks in their stats thing.   you need to click on a few of the google links as some dont have stat counters.   &nbsp; (S)  enough.

      thats it  im creating a kirsty wark from newsnight fan club.  no reason, its just that there should be one. Actually there should be many, governed by a central and regulatory body called OFWARK.  in the club we will meet and try and do her accent and then once we realise that all we can do is say certain words a bit like billy connolly we'll think of something else to do.  at the moment of course "we" is actually just me, sitting alone in my room, pretending to be kirsty wark.  join me.

      why can i recognise quotes from blade runner, full metal jacket and holy grail but be clueless about songs from pretty much every disney film every made?  &nbsp;  The answer, i like to think, is that i am indescribably cool.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the&nbsp;real world though, &nbsp;its just that when you watch T2 when you are&nbsp;five, you cant really go back to&nbsp;snow white and the seven dwarfs.  &nbsp;  Disney can go and feed its rat representatives to feral cats with big pointy teeth.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      sometimes, at the end of the day, you stop and think about what you have done rationally.  Then you realise what a completely weird day you've just had and how odd your life is going to get for the time being.  yesterday: rationally.  1) Go to portsmouth rather early in the morning. 2) Spend 6 hours with people who have only travelled about 30 mins to be there, making you feel like the 2 hour trip might have been a bit excessive. 3) learn how to push people in wheel chairs up and down stairs (the key is not tipping them out) 4) discover i am going to spend a week in france with the people i met yesterday. (fortunately they are all pretty cool.  some are even from the isle of white, and i have no idea why that fact interests me so much) 5) sit clueless through a religious ceremony. 6) go to a little chef 7) go home.  i could explain the one thing that makes all of the above make some sort of sense, but im not saying anything for now.  see, i'm not the only one round here who can have secrets.  As for the rest of my summer, it seems it will be spent walking around tewkesbury buying very large quantities of fruit and then writing about them  Again, i could explain, but i choose not to.  For now.  There is also a part of me, that has decided, against the will of the rest of me, to learn every bone in the human body.  I have no idea why.  I am somehow rationalising it to myself with the following idea:  there are 206 bones.  Whatever is on the left is on the right. 103 bones to remember. 26 vertebrae, which i hope will all have similar names, or numbers.  77 bones to remember. 24 ribs, which i hope also have numbers. 65 bones to remember.  how hard can it be?  i am actually showing restraint with this idea: at first it was all the bones and all the muscles.  Then i saw a diagram, which cut away into many smaller diagrams of many, many muscles, working other muscles, working smaller muscles.  This summer is going to be...... something

Ah yes, nothing.    1) feel confident enough to pick up nun chaku  2) swing nun chaku about pretending you are bruce lee  3) watch as nun chaku collides with knee with breathtaking force  4) sit down, scared of nun chaku.  5) repeat    thinking about getting some knives.

      I have decided to use my experience and my cynicism of all self help books to make my own tips on how to be more confident, which is frankly laughable, if you knew me.  Firstly its important to know that im not going to sugar coat any of this: i'm sick of agony aunts etc saying "i think you are the kind of person who likes to be alone" when what they mean is "you are a loner who pretends to enjoy being on his own because thats the only way you can make life bearable"  so here goes.  1) you are a loner who pretends to enjoy being on his own because thats the only way you can make life bearable.  if you have no friends its because you havent bothered to get any so dont complain about being lonely when its all your fault.  why dont you try doing something instead of sitting in your house watching repeats of friends.  2) its a shame that your crippling lack of confidence has always meant that you find it hard speaking to people.  Its such a pity that you feel that there isnt anyone on your wavelength.  well here's some news: everyones just as nuts as you, possibly more so.  As for your lack of confidence, GET OVER IT, confidence is faked almost as easily as pleasant surprise is faked on christmas morning.  all you have to do is act it more than others.  if you dont believe me then think about an interview: you're scared as feck before but the second you walk in and shake their hand, you get on with it because sitting there in silence is not an option.  you idiot.  3) If you find yourself in a room with a bunch of screaming neanderthalic spongemonkeys (eg the big brother house) it's ok to choose to let them get on with it, and you can watch from afar as they create a cult to their new god akkyakyakakakak and construct a shrine to him using some cardboard boxes, lilt and a curly whirly (or whatever they do).  Not getting on with people is fine if they really arent your sort of person, chances are there are others there who dont like being made to worship at the temple of curly whirly who you can speak to.  However, dont speak too long, particularly if they start preparing the holy cress of ritual sacrifice.  4)get confident you psychosomatic little shit.  5)Are you just pretending to lack confidence to make you seem more interesting: the crazy neurotic guy who is quirky and loveable.  Well, you arent. it's like people who pretend to be hyper after drinking a minimal amount of fizzy drink as an excuse to generally annoy everyone and alleviate any responsibility because they were supposedly rendered incapable of reasonable thought by some sugar.  Are you diabetic? no? then surely you can cope.  get a grip.  6) If you have a serious problem with confidence, why are you reading this? do something about it.  If you carry on reading, i am only going to insult you further and thats not going to help, is it?  you ugly useless unbalanced joke.  you are too old as well.  and your hair looks stupid, all the time. loser.   Like i said, im not exactly world champion of confidence, but i am world champion of hypocracy, so there you go.  And before anyone gets upset, im not making fun of anyone here, Im insulting a reader, not anyone in particular.  You all know im only joking anyway.  well, joking some of the time .  ok, joking occasionally.  the bit about hyper fizzy drink sippers is true, they really annoy me.

      I learnt the best party trick in the world last night in my martial arts class.  Take one plastic chop stick.  Place one end in to the soft bit of your throat.  Place the other into the palm of your hand.  Push chop stick into throat till it breaks.  Honestly, i can do this. Took a little bit of training last night so you shouldnt just try it without knowing what to do and how to do it as safely as you can.  All about chi apparently.
