      I hate my car. I mean that in the nicest way possible, but why does the thing have to cost me so much money? After spending 800 dollars  EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS!  to get the brakes fixed last month, they started a squeakin' and a grindin' again this morning. I'm sorry, mechanic man, but I'm not made of money. Fortunately, I didn't even have to pitch a fit at the Gulf Station to not have to pay for the repair. They honored their 30-day warranty. I think that's the first time that's ever happened to me.  Last night I went to stay at my friend's cousin's (you following?) apartment for the week. They fled town during the Convention, so I get to stay within walking distance of my workplace--hooray! Except, not so much. The person with the key to the place didn't arrive until we had waited in the hall for TWO AND ONE HALF HOURS. I read a magazine, wrote a card, and realized that, somehow, my laptop had used up all its battery in some sort of rebellion. Laptop, all I wanted to do was write a paper on you, is that so difficult?   I swear, applying to grad school is like taking on a part-time job. I could easily spend several hours a night working on applications, essays, papers, letter, and studying for the blasted GRE. I have to figure out a way to balance this with everything else that's going on in my life. Um, goodbye television and other mindless endeavors.

      So, here's the thing. I'm not a democrat (is anyone from Boston reading this? Because, if so, I'm sorry and there's nothing I can do about it.) nor am I terribly interested in politics. Why am I telling you this? Because, my friends, we are currently suffering through the Democratic National Convention. Except that, as it turns out, it's sort of like when we had the Olympics in Salt Lake City and everybody overreacted and fled the city. My usually 30-45 minutes commute took 15 minutes this morning. 15 MINUTES!!! I'm seriously rethinking the decision to stay within walking distance of work. But alas, my stuff's in my car and I don't want to go home now.  I've now been at work for 10 hours. Did I mention that I'm sick of my job? I'm applying to grad school and I can't tell anyone at work for fear that they'll fire me. Maybe it's an irrational fear, but it's a fear I have nonetheless. I mean, if they did fire me, I'm sure I could scream discrimination and then I could work for another year at a job where everybody hated me... Nope, not an option. So keeping grad school a secret is really the only way to go.  What was I saying? Oh, yes, that I'm still at work, trying desperately to make myself care about clearing off my desk. The thing is, I don't feel like processing these housing applications or planning the company picnic. I'm just saying.
