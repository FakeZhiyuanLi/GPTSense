      I turn 33 tomorrow. What have I done in my 33 years that I am proud of?  . I married Fiona . I stayed with my first employer for 9 years and was highly regarded (at least I'd like to think that I was) . I became a  urlLink CFA  charterholder  What I enjoyed in my 33 years:  . My school years - primary through  urlLink university  . Holidays with Fiona and the folks . Drinking with the guys . Movie nights in Melbourne  Any regrets?  . Not being able to even remotely master Mandarin . Accounting work?  What next?  . Kids . My own business - screening indie movies or selling shoes?

       "Chronic remorse, as all the moralists are agreed, is a most undesirable sentiment. If you have behaved badly, repent, make what amends you can and address yourself to the task of behaving better next time. On no account brood over your wrong-doing. Rolling in the muck is not the best way of getting clean." -  Aldous Huxley

      Well ... my first blog entry. The only reason I am doing this is because I am in-between jobs. Left  urlLink UBS  at the end of April without a job. Thought I would do so many things, but ended up staying home instead ... well most of the time anyway. And what better way to spend the time at home than surf the net and discover new things! So this is it. My first journal entry. Hopefully it's not my last. Am leaving for Melbourne tomorrow for a short golfing holiday and fortunately or unfortunately I have to start work in mid-June. Yup, found a market risk job at  urlLink OCBC . Was a little worried about not being able to get work and thus not being able to support our lifestyle. Yes I am married to the wonderful and beautiful Fiona! But now that I have found work, I wish that I could have had more free time to do things I would never have gotten the chance to do with a steady job. Things like improving my golf scores and getting that elusive handicap; like travelling and learning to paint. Though I did splash some acrylic on canvas last Sunday at Mui Leng's place. Mui Leng ... Fiona's docent friend from her group at the  urlLink SAM . Will try to post a picture of my "piece of art" when I fugure out how.

      Three of my best friends had kids within two weeks of each other about a year ago. All three were boys. Yup ... had to fork out some hard earned moolah to get gifts. The time has come again as they turn one. And I have been reminded of this by the eager parents. What is it with them? As if I would forget.  Make sure you buy a good present ;  Don't be a cheapskate ;  No favouritism for your god-son  (yes I know it's hard to believe that I am a god-father). As if life is not pressurising enough. I have to now worry about whether the presents I get are good enough for their kids! Anyway, I decided that I would get them all books. Figured I might as well get them something fun and educational. So today I made a trip to Borders. Turns out they have a pretty great selection of kiddie books. Pop-ups, board books, Ladybird books, audio books etc. Spent a whole afternoon looking at childrens books. Cannot believe it myself. Me, the guy without a kid, spending so much time in the kiddie section of a bookstore.  Ran into an old school-mate who was buying childbirth/first-child books for his wife. Was getting my books wrapped and didn't notice he was also getting his wrapped. His wife is expecting sometime in July and was going to K.L. to deliver. Why? So that the kid would automatically have dual citizenship. She (yes it's going to be a baby girl) would be both Singaporean and Malaysian at the same time. That got me thinking a little bit. Why would he want dual citizenship for his daughter? He has spent most of his life in Singapore, his friends are here, he served in the army, he has family here. Why would he think of leaving Singapore? Or why would he think his daughter may need Malaysian citizenship? I hope that it has nothing to do with loyalty (or lack of it) or being marginalised in Singapore. I do not think that he is alone in thinking aboutthis though.  If the perception in Singapore is that some are being marginalised, then I think that should change. We should see tangible results of any changes that are made. Racial integration is important for Singapore and I personally think that more of an effort should be made by everyone. It would be a sad day if people got the best out of Singapore only to leave in dab times.  Think I had better stop now in case someone actually reads this and takes offense.

            What a great escape to Melbourne. We played 2 rounds of golf over the weekend at  urlLink Moonah Links  (pictures above). The courses were really spectacular although much less can be said about my scores. The moonah is actually a tree. Click here for a  urlLink picture . They are hardy, gnarly little trees that shelter you from the winds.
