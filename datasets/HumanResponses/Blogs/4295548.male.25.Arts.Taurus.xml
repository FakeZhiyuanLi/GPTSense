      I was in my kitchen, and I heard a crash outside, and I thought " awww cool someone hit something". I open up my Kitchen door only to find that a Honda civic has rear ended my car.  He hit a parked car.  Lemme say that again. He Hit A Parked Car. My parked car.  His recount of the situation was " Well I was turning right, but then my car just stopped moving, and I was like 'Why is my car not moving?'"...to which I replied...." Because you hit my car"  That's about as basic as you can get. Anyways, his insurance, Progressive, is very prompt and courteous. It was a very well choreographed show this morning when I went to give them my car, and pick up the rental. Hopefully my scoob will be returned in an acceptable condition, and I can forget my bumper ever looked like that.  Here's some pics for ya.

       urlLink    Yeah  So ...Progressive gave me this.  A 2004 Hyundai Santa Fe....blah.  The one they gave me is white though....not quite as impressive as this black one... that's conquering that patch of grass.

      I have deemed Joes Inn My favorite Restaraunt in the Richmond Metro Area. Great Club Sandwich, Pastrami on Rye, and the Amazing Joes Spaghetti.  All for very low prices.         Daves Taverna (Harrisonburg, VA) Stands as one of my all time favorite restaraunts.

      Interstate 95 is a beast.  It breathes fire.  Interstate 64 is a little bunny rabbit compared to I-95.         I-295 is I-95's Bitch.

      So yeah, the other day at work, I was doing my usual no. 1 in the urinal at Market Cafe.  And I noticed a crisp Twenty dollar bill, sitting at the bottom of the urinal.    At first I thought it was some hidden camera prank or something... but I soon got over that.  So yeah, I grabbed the 20.  As I was reaching for it..I noticed it was fake, and well I kinda knew deep down it was fake anyways, but I thought it would be a hoot to grab it anyways.  And of course, it was a twenty dollar bill telling me that I was going to hell, and I'm a foolish human being etc. etc.  (sidenote: I wonder if anyone, when they get these little "fear" notes, go " Holy Crap!!! I'm an idiot and a worthless pile of crap....I need help." )   Instead of throwing it away, I threw it back in the urinal, just hoping to frustrate another opportunist like myself.     I proceeded to wash my hands and exit the restroom.

      So here tis.  My blog.  I never thought I would need , or even want one of these...but today I signed myself up for it, and here it goes.  1. Nothing I write on here will be forced.  Whatever I write, is what I write, and that's it.  2. Comment away  There are only two things.
