           That's a Gammorean Guard from "Return of the Jedi".  I love those things.  Great facial structure.  They were clumsy, stupid and fun to draw as a kid.  Just a great idea for a guard.  They are comming out with a bust of this guy.  I want him for christmas.  I think I'll post everything I want for Christmas here on my blog so you can get a better idea who I am.                        I saw the village a week ago.  The only reason I'm  mentioning it now is because I think I have calmed down from feeling as if I've been tortured for 90min then robbed of $7.50.  That movie could not have sucked any more if it tried.  The idea of a "creature" who lived in the woods....and you both understand where the line is and you never cross it....it has certain colors that attracts them, and certain rituals the village goes through to apease it.  It had the feeling of the beginning of King Kong where they had to sacrafice a young woman to him and you can hear the trees rustle and shake....that feeling you got just before you actually SAW Kong was terrifying.  In The Village that whole concept is so drawn out in a Hokey way that I found myself thinking that this was a horror flick for the Amish.  I couldn't get past how incredibly BORING the town was.  They all spoke as if they were from the Amish land and too damn polite.  The only saving grace of the flim was that guy...Jo..Joqu...a..i...oh hell, River Phoenix's brother.  He's intensly handsome and what happens to him?  They stab him right off.  I was ready to leave after that!!  Did nobody in that town wonder....where do we buy our fabric from to make these drab clothes?  Where did we get these "Ball" jars to put candles in to hang in the greenhouse for the wedding?  Complete waste of money and time I tell you.  It would have been cooler if those things turned out to be real.......and democrats.  Now that would be horrifying.

      I work with a woman whom I think had a nervous breakdown.  When she talks, it looks a though she's trying to chew through the side of her cheek.  She can't sit still or stand still when she's talking, which by the way is almost constantly and almost always about her awful husband #4.   She told me she's been married 4 times, each time she was drunk and it was at the justice of the peace.  She also told me how her husband does not bathe, carves his name onto everything, how he is "stupid" and "cheap".  I don't know.  I think if I was married to this psycho I wouldn't be right in the head either.  She talks to her computer from time to time when she thinks nobody is looking.  Then denies it.  I have this wonderful boss, whom of which I consider an old soul, who has the patience of a kindergarten teacher dealing with mentally retarded children.  I mean he's just very patient and laid back with her.  I give him kudos for that.  I would have canned her months ago.  She goes on and on arguing with him about stuff (like the talking to inanimate objects) and denying she did it.  She falls asleep while talking to people on the phone.  I can go on and on....  but today she blew all of us out the water.  She just turned around in her seat and began to tell us how she's been to swingers clubs and sex shops with one of her husbands.  She also went into detail about a "Glory Hole" to one employee.  Amazing part is...she had to get all of our attention to tell us.  The room was silent until she just turns around and decides we needed to know this.   I think she's on drugs to be honest.  She has high highs and very low lows.  He husband told her son today that he will be divorcing her in 2 months.  Her reaction:  "I think I should quit here".  Wouldn't your reaction to such news is to do all you can to become self sufficient and prepared to take care of yourself?  Insane I tell you.  Simply insane.

      So I go into the Dentist on Wednesday thinking that I am just going to have my two new crowns on and be on my merry way - boy was I wrong.  After I sit all comfy in the chair he tells me "well, today we finish your two root canals and seems I may have to pull that wisdom tooth there".  Do you smell that?  Its my pants.  I just shit them.  You have got to be kidding me.  I never had a tooth pulled mainly because I'm a coward.  I was 27 before I even went to the dentist for the first time.   Now mind you, the last time I was there, he slipped with the drill and cut my tounge.  Ouch.  He asks then "strongly reccomends" while showing me my xray that it has to come out.  Ok fine, do it.  I asked him sweetly "numb the shit out of me doc" and he does.  But I flip out.  I think it was a panic attack or something.  I couldnt stop shaking, sweating...he stops half way though "Do you want me to give you a break" and through the blood, drool and God knows what else is going on in my mouth I yell "Go Go Go!!"  Just get this over with will ya?  Come to find out, my tooth was growing sideways in my mouth.  Nothing is ever easy with me.   So I go home, my jaw hurt from pushing and pulling, but not so much from missing a tooth.  But those two root canals are the bitch.  They still hurt and today is Sunday.  So on my way home, I pull out the gauze 20 min after pulling just like he said....out comes one of my temporarys....gatta go back the next morning.  That hurt putting it back in cuz I'm sore.....but get this...yesterday (Saturday) ..my OTHER temporary comes out.   As I swig on this Coke here, I wonder....what went wrong with my teeth...... *Grin*
