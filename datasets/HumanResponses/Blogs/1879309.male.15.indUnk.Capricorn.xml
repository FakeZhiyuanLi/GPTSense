        Excel Blog Response       Excel is a commonly used program for reports, graphed data, etc...    Excel is a rapidly growing program, that is found on almost every common computer in homes. Excel is used for data graphing, school work or even organizing report card marks! Excel, however, is a worldwide program, not only is excel used in Canada, but also in European parts of the world and in south America, Australia is also another country with excel. Africa has also experienced the features of excel! Even though the versions are different, and more or less features are in the version, excel is still able to give the user exceptional features.         Excel is so common, infact ask your self what is Excel, you are mostlikley to be able to state many facts about Excel. Excel is also being updated, and it is an important software i use. Do you use Excel? The answer is most likely to be yes, if not some information must be in your mind stored.

        Software Blog Response       I have chosen Microsoft Word as the Program          Other Versions I am Aware of:       1. Microsoft word 2002       2.  Microsoft Word 2000       3. Microsoft Word 6.0 (DOS)       Here is more Information about Microsoft Word Versions    there are many advantages for buying the latest versions of the software, such as more features (something every computer user wants). Another fact is that many people think getting discounts of newer versions is great, but sometimes scams occur. The first thing one should always think of is that companies want money not for people to get more features, if the program seems amazing and is too cheap, take time to think. Many companies do provide discounts if the customer does have previous version, this gives the customer trust in the company, but sometimes the discount is actually the regular price in discuss. Students too get discounts sometimes, and Companies think that simple minds can be tricked, so once more check for the catch. Students often do get discounts that are great, however. Most companies provide discounts for previous owners, not students.    If I had owned a business I would probably get affected by all the discounts and cheap prices. As we discussed in class Imac went out of business, if they had not cheated as many discounts as they did maybe they could have pulled back without any help. My business would also get affected with the cost of my stocks increasing and decreasing. My company would be affected in another way which would be my customers, I only earn money from my customer, newer versions attract customers, My company must have at least three different programs out every two- four weeks.     Microsoft Word Prices    Microsoft word prices are decreasing now a days, since most computers are already bought with them, another reason is the constant illegal downloading of programs such as Kazaa, In fact if you go to www.microsoft.com you will see that a downloadable program of Microsoft word is there.    www.microsoft.com

         Different Types of Image Formats    There are two basic types of images, GIF and JPG. GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and takse less space then JPG( a better version). JPG stands for Joint Photographic Group and has low quality compared to GIF. The fact that GIF takes less space is also very useful. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group this is good for making the image take up less space, however, this causes the imager to become "junky" the pixels become more visable and the picture doe snot like it is blending     A well blended Image with small Pixels          An even worse situation is if you try to inlarge the image, this will make your image even worse and the pixels will show even more and distort the Image. Resolotion can also help with your images previewed. If an image is with lower resoloution the pixels are less previewed causing the image to blend together nicely. If an image has a low pixels rate per inch and the user streches the image out.

         Viavoice     Viavoice is an old program designed by IBM that basically types for one. This program was meant to change computering for many generations to come, yet it was for some reason not sold. There was ,however, an increase in profits after a couple of years, yet the program is still not very popular. Viacoice was build to type any word spoken but many words were spelled wrong or the program was unable to idetify them. It turned out that many people were unable to use the program because of their accents and that caused IBM to not sell as many of vaivoice as they thought.
