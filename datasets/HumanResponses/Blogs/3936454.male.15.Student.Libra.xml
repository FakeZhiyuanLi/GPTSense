      Okay, I've decided to follow some advice and profile different bands I like here in my blog. I could do the ones everybody's heard of, but where's the fun in that? So I'm going to start. This time I'm going to do an exceptional pop-punk band named Fall Out Boy. Quite talented. Very captivating voice. Oh, and I have it on good authority that they are good looking too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fall Out Boy was formed in 2001 when Pete Wentz quit his group Arma Angelus and joined up with his friend Joe Trohman and began writing songs for fun. After a while, they stumbled across Patrick Strump who has a very charismatic voice, and thus, the birth of Fall Out Boy. After much trial and error the 3 found a permenant drummer in Andy Hurley. Working out of their hometown of Chicago the group made a name for themselves. Soon after a&nbsp; 3 song demo they collarborated with Project Rocket to make a 2 sided EP. Now record labels from New York to L.A. were watching them, and Fall Out Boy, choose to sign with Fueled By Ramen Records. If you're interested in them i suggest you either visit their website at  urlLink http://www.falloutboyrock.com/home.php . or some of their better songs are Calm Before The Storm, Pretty In Punk and Chicago Is So&nbsp;Two Years Ago.  &nbsp; Until My next blog.....keep Reading this one.

      ...That I'm more interesting than most people, Probably including you. I feel that if you're more interesting than me, prove it. And now my  interesting  rant will begin. Todays topic of discussion (by me) on Lets see...Music!!! Music is the best thing going, as long as you listen top the right kind of music. So, if you're listening to rap, Don't. Listen to something where it is possibe for the artists to actually be artists and create something that took talent, not something where they gave a retard a rhyming dictionary. So if you find this uninteresting, come back and I'll lambast you for being an idiot. Now carry on with your worthless days.

        Public Service Announcement        I've come to a realization after re-reading my first attempt at a blog entry that i came off as an extremly arrogant jackass. I'd like to retract my statements and say.*ahem* I am no more interesting then anybody reading this. In Fact in Interestingness levels you're kicking my proverbial ass.Thank you, Now you may continue to my new Blog entry.  Welcome the whole new pain. Of A new school year. It's close who cares, Let's move on. Vacations sucked this year, I've only been home 5 days in the past 5 weeks So It's good to be back. I don't have much to say right now cause it sucked and I don't feel like boring you as of right now. I'll just wrap this up with PLease, for the love of god, Everybody take a few minutes of your day and Listen to Drowning Lessons by My Chemical Romance and Failure By Designer Jeans by From First to Last. Thats it, I'm out for now.
