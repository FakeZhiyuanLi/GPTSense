      This will be my last blog for almost three weeks, as we head out for the great state of North Dakota.&nbsp; This will be my first time to that state, and I am very excited.&nbsp; We will be staying with John's parents the whole time we are there.&nbsp; Some things we plan to do include going to the ND state fair, driving up to Canada, and going down to Mt. Rushmore (sp).&nbsp; So now, it's time for last minute packing!&nbsp; My parents just left.&nbsp; I gave them the tour of things to take care of, feeding Milo, his box (fun stuff), his snacks, the houseplnants, ant the mail.&nbsp; The Rubesh's down the street will be watering our out side plants.&nbsp; The patio looks so colorful and fun now that the summer patio furnature and plants are about it.&nbsp; I'll return to this blog spot in about 2 1/2 weeks. Bye for now, J

      IT's another scortcher here in the great Northwest.&nbsp; Don't let anyone tell you it's a mild climate.&nbsp; I mean we had a snow storn last winter, and now this!&nbsp; O.K., so it is mild here for the most part, and those little dips and reaches in temps just makes life more interesting and more seasonal!&nbsp; I drove to the end of town to one of my favorite espresso drive threws this am, Dutch Brothers.&nbsp; I got a very yummy NF, 16 oz,&nbsp;decaf,&nbsp;iced, double chocolate mocha, (but Dutch bros automatically makes all 16 oz iced orders into 20 oz).&nbsp; I love Dutch Bros, becuase their lattes/mochas are sooo good, and their prices are 25 cents to 50 cents cheeper on average per drink than other places (like Starbucks). &nbsp;I also get another 25 cents off for having a little symbol on my car.&nbsp; Cool deal, oh, and they have a punch card.&nbsp; OK, I admit it, Im a latte freak, but who isn't in the NW?&nbsp; Well, I guess John isn't, and then my parents arn't either.&nbsp; They all just like getting lattes for occasional treats.&nbsp; For me its and often treat!&nbsp; Hmm, I can say that I've been successful in cutting down on the blended drinks (which are worse for you), and I've been getting decaf.&nbsp; So, a little progress made, but still a fun habit I need to cut down on.&nbsp; On my way back from Dutch bros, my normallly 5 minute trek took 30 minutes.&nbsp; Little did I realize that this weekend is "Old Fasion Days" in Newberg.&nbsp; When I thought I would beat the slow traffic by taking backroads, I just drove myself right into the festival.&nbsp; Oh well, I got an extra tour of our cute little town, even if I did have to stop for petestrians 20 times! So it's still blazing hot, and our AC is having a hard time keeping up.&nbsp; Its just not getting down to the tempt we set it on.&nbsp; Well, at least its cooler than if we didn't have AC.&nbsp; I need to get myself moving today.&nbsp; I need to finish packing and get the house clean, especially the floors, they are way overdue!

      Wow, it is so, so hot!&nbsp; It was high 90's today, and is suppose to hit 101 tomorrow.&nbsp; Yes, world it does actually get hot in Oregon!&nbsp; I just talked to my dad, who just flew in from Fullerton CA on a business trip.&nbsp; He was saying how he was telling the others that he was going home to a hotter place.&nbsp; They could'nt beleive it.&nbsp; Dad going to S. Cal for a little cool down, now that seems funny! Hey, I'll take low 90's with low humidity anyday over this humid 100 degree torture.&nbsp; I have to admit though, having air conditioning is pure indulgance!&nbsp; Growing up with out it we just roasted!&nbsp; Could'nt sleep or anything!&nbsp;  John and I drove down to Salem to go to his favorite restaurant, Changs.&nbsp; It's a Mongolian BBQ style place.&nbsp; Very yummy, you just got to make sure you don't eat to much, or let me tell you, you'll be miserable!&nbsp; Just 3 more days until we hit the rode.&nbsp; I quess that will mean 2 1/2 weeks without blogging.&nbsp; I quess I'll survive.&nbsp; As of a week or so ago, I didn't even know it exsisted.&nbsp; I must admit, blogging is a fun activity!&nbsp; I'm wondering what will happen when I go back to work in the fall.&nbsp; I suppose my blogs will become shorter and fewer between, but I really do hope to keep up with it.&nbsp; It is really fun to keep up with other freinds blog's too!

      Today I got my hair cut and highlighted.&nbsp; I really do like how my hair looks highlighted!&nbsp; The cut is great too.&nbsp; I am so glad I found someone closer, and who is much cheeper!!&nbsp; She is also a Christian, and that's awsome!&nbsp; Then it was off to my weekly allergy shots.&nbsp; Gosh, as they increase the dosage, it hurts more.&nbsp; My right arm has a bumpr so big, that I'm going to tease John tonight and tell him to "look at how big my tricep muscle is getting".&nbsp; Now off to ballet, so a busy but fun filled day.&nbsp; Even allergy shots can be fun (that is when you get a mocha while you're waiting during your half hour caution period -to make sure you don't blow up like a balloon or something =).

      I'm getting a lot of work done on our wedding scrap book.&nbsp; I think its going to turn out pretty neat!&nbsp; We are finally getting ready to order our wedding picutures.&nbsp; I mean, its only been over a year since we got married, we're on the ball right?&nbsp; Well, we had to wait for our tax return to come in, and then things got busy with the end of the school year.&nbsp; I'm having trouble cutting down the pcitures I want.&nbsp; We are going to meet with the photgrapher, and he'll give us some ideas.&nbsp; Praise the Lord!&nbsp; Our car repairs will be much less than we thought.&nbsp; We took the car to my dad's mechanic, and his estimate was much less. and not all the work the other place siad needed to be done, really did.&nbsp; Gosh, it's so hard to know who to trust!&nbsp; Thank goodness for wise protective Dad's! &nbsp;

      Just your classical Sunday afternoon for the Heizelman's.&nbsp; Church was&nbsp;uplifting and usual, but I was really tired during the service.&nbsp; The Sanctuary is always warm, winter or summer.&nbsp; USually I find churches cold, but not this one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Be careful of wearing sweaters in the winter!&nbsp; We got some pictures back today of our trip to the coast.&nbsp; John cought some really neat views of the sunset!&nbsp; I think we might blow one or two of them up to frame.&nbsp; John's outside trying to kill the moss in our grass.&nbsp; I jsut finished cleaning the bathroom., oh, my favorite job by far. NOT!&nbsp; We really don't have anything pressing, so we should be able to relax tonight.&nbsp; Later this week, we'll be busy getting ready for our 1 1/2 week long road trip tp North Dakota.&nbsp; That's were John's family all lives.&nbsp; Thsi will be my first venture that far east.&nbsp; I've been to Co. but not further (at least in the US, I've been to Cancun and Haiti which are farther east - stops at ariports in NY at Florida, but that really doesn't count).&nbsp; Hmm. I think I'll go sit out on the porch swing.&nbsp; It's kinda muggy today, so I'll see how long&nbsp; i last.&nbsp; Oh, my talk with CHristy last night was a special treat.&nbsp; She might try to call again befreo we leave for ND, but then after than we probably won't talk again, until they are home on fulough in about two years! Bummer!

      Saturdays are great for sleepiong in.  Then, Just as you are finally getting ready for the day, having a good freind call.  Rachel called today.  We haven't talked for awhile, and usually we keep in pretty close contact.  Jim and her have been busy remodeling their kitchen.  I'm really curious as to waht it will look like when they are done.  I can't believe I haven't seen Rach for a year!  The last time was when she was a bridesmaid in my wedding.  I think that's the longest now.  I use to make it down to cal more often, but now it's been since Annie's wedding.  For a few months there, I went down thetr four times in like a four month period.  I had Chloe's wedding, then Rachel's, then visited Christy and her new baby, and then Annie's weeding.  Haven't been back since.  The rest of the time has been spent getting ready for my wedding, getting married, and being married.  Which has been absolutely awsome!  John and I do need to make a trip down their sometime in the near future.  Their are a lot of people I want to visit!!  Ok, so John just made kraft mac and cheese, so I better go get my share.  I think we will take a trip to costco today.  They have pj bottoms on sale, and I desparately need some.  At least for the upcoming winter months.  Then I think we are going over to the Christian book store to find some Cd's for our rode trip coming up.  Oh, and I'm really excited, because Christy is calling tonight.  She is my really close freind.  Her and her husband are Bible translators in Papua New Guinea.  Christy just had her 2nd child, Nathan Christian.  They went to Australia to have him, so she can actually call me.  So, can't wait to talk with her.  I bet my mac is cold now. Either than, or John ate my share. J

      So, yesterday was a nice relaxing short of day.  For lunch I went over to my freind Kristen's house.  She is also my Mary Kay consultant.  We had fun playing around with color.  I found a new lipstick color I liked, and alos ordered a couple needed items.  She said we would have to get together soon for pampering our feet.  Sounds awsome.  She has a very cute baby boy.  He is 4 months old, but my gosh you would think he was at least 6 months if not 7 or 8.  He is the chunkiest little baby ever, but oh so cute.  He has a very nice smile.  Kristen and her husband just started going to a church in town they really like.  John and I may try it sometime soon.  We like the church we have been attending recently, but we are still kinda looking.  Being at the ocean a few days ago was an awsome reminder of what an awsome artist our Lord is.  I mean, he is the artist we all try to imitate in our various artistic ways.  It's so abvious that the universe had to be created, its just so awsomely creative!  Today, I'm getting a second pricing on my needed car repairs, sounds like we might be able to save some money!  Woo hoo!  It's my dad's mechanic, so I better get going over to Tualatin soon.  Mom and Dad have the day off, so they are having me over for lunch and I'm bringing over left over wedding cake (the lady who made our cake, remakes your top for you on your first anniversary - way cool - Im sure it taste a lot more fresher than if we froze the real one from our wedding).

      Our first anniversary was better than I expected.  We had the most beuatiful hotel room at "Inn at Spanish Head".  The back wall was one big sliding dorr that opened to an ocean view that was almost literally at our door step (except we were 7 stories up.  The inn is built into a costal cliff.  It was such a relaxing time, and I had a hard time leaving.  The most exciting thing was seeing Grey Whales of the coast at Boiler Bay.  We didn't stop to see the whales, but to see the boiler that had exploded on a hip almsot one hundred years ago.  However, we got a much better view.  At least three grey whale spouting, and playing, and one even crested his head a few times.  From John for my anniversary present, I got to pick out a china cup and china luncheoun plate for my collection.  Someday I'll have enough to have quest over for three course meals, or to have teas!!  I got John a shirt.  That doesn't seem very romantic, but that's what he wanted, and men just don't have those romantic type things you can get them, like jewlery, etc.  Oh, and he also got me tow red roses symbolizing the two of us.  His rose was much taller than mine.  Hmm, wonder why =)  Oh, better comment on why I titled this blog "Biological Clock Appears to be Ticking."  Well, for some reason, I'm having these stong urges to want to have a baby.  I mean, everytime I see a baby I want to hold it, play with it, etc.  Lots of my freinds have had babies lately, but many have not yet either.  I really don't want one right now logically.  John and I are planning to start trying in a couple years, and having one around three years from now.  I know that's best, but emotionally/hormonally I feel like I want to be pregnant and I want to have a baby.  This is actually a new thing for me.  I've never been much of a baby person.  I've alwaysed prefered elementary age kids.  That way they can communicate with you, but somethings starting to change with me.  Baby clothes are jsut the cutest things!  Well, at least I'll be goos and ready when that time comes.  I quess I jsut did a lot of personal blabbing, but I quess that's waht this blog is for.  Well. I think I'll stop for now, before this blog ends up being a book. J

      Yesterday went by quickly, I slept a lot.  I guess it was a combo of my CFS, PMS, etc.  Then I had a performance at the American Cancer Society Fundraiser that Kim was in charge of.  In fact, I saw her and her dad on the news last night.  It's pretty cool to see people you know on tv.  I need to get some stuff done around he house today!  John comes home tonight, rather than tommorow night like he usually would on his three day work weekend.  He has tomorrow off becuase it's our first anniversary!  I can't wait to celebrate it.  It's an occasion I've never celebrated before!  I quess the hotel we are going to has a nice early bird special for dinner, its like a 6 course meal or something like that!  I think we will dress up a little (that means getting John out of his jeans =)).  We are also picking up our cake top.  The lady who made our cake, makes a remake of you cake top for you 1st anniversary (so it tastes a lot better than a year old one).  It's $15, and we must save mom and dad a piece.    My car, ahh, my car.  It appears we have almost 1,000 in repairs to do on it.  Well, wonder how Rachel's Saturn is doing, becuase mine just took a sudden dive.  Well, quess this is all for today.  Won't be writing for a few days, casue I'll be off with my love. J

      o.k so got to make this a quick one today.  I was invited to a lunch with some ladies that I work with at Hopkins E.  They are like my mom's age, but they are really neat ladies.  I think most, if not all of them are Christians.  Way cool.  So, then after lucnh, I got to get going fast, becasue I have dance class today.  Gosh, I quess I have two today.  Ballet, but before that it's epiphany dancers.  I guess Im the only one who can make it today, so I'll get a Jazz lesson.  Can't wait.  Hmm, this is kinda fun, I like this.  Well, gosh, better shower, and do hair, and actually put makeup on today. J

      O.k. so my freind Alicia got me started on this.  Like her I'm not much of a journaler.  In fact I really hate it.  Maybe this will help, or maybe I will never write on hear agian.  I plan to though.  Well, I can't write much now.  John's hungry, so I better go.  I think we are grabbing subway.  Got one of those stamp cards, so we get a free san.  Our 1st anniversay is soon, this coming Monday.  Can't wait.  We are going to the coast and staying at a really neat place.

      John and I just got back from church.  It's another warm muggy day.  I really don't care for humidity.  I like dry heat much better.  Today we are going out to lunch with grandma and grampa, and grandpa's son and his wife (son from a previous marriage).  Originally we were going to meet at mom and dad's to say good bye to nate, but nate got sick and so we are going to meet at the Spagehetti Factory instead.  I love the Spagehetti Factory, but I'm not really looking forward to it today.  I started a wheat free diet last week to see If wheat might be the culprit of my joint/bone pain.  The pain might just be realted to my Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  At anyrate I jsut want to get to the bottom of my fatigue and pain.  IT can be very debilitating at times!  Please pray for me.  Anyways, I'll half to order one of their non pasta dishes and skip the yummy bread with garlic butter (big bummer!!!!!!).  I'm seeing an allergist in a week or so to determine if I do indeed/or do not have a wheat allergy/intolerance. Alos, keep Jerry Weber in Your prayers.  He is like an adopted grandpa to me.  His wife and hiim always opened their house to me and my friends when I went to school at Biola!  They even flew up to Oregon, just to come to our wedding.  He has kidney failure and a staff infection.  He wil be in the hospital for several weeks.

      Yesterday I got a really awsome deal.  Fred's (which is like a one stop shopping place in the NW) was having an extra 50% of on clearnce items.  They had this really neat dark dark blue ceramic vases with white glaze dripping down.  I got two tall and skinny ones and one short and fat.  They look great on our fire place hearth! I love the olymics, and I am so excited for them to get started.  I love the gymnastics, swimming, and track and feild the best.  I always find myself wanting to be one of those athletes.  I remember when I was little, after seeing ice skating on tv I would slide around on our wood floor hall way, pretending to ice skate.  I think the olympics are extra exciting this year, becuase they are in Greece, the origin of the olymic games!  The opening cermony is tonight!  I'm going out to lunch with mom today.  I got her a few little things on our trip I'll give her then.  It will also be nice to tell her all about our trip.

      John and I had a wonderful time in North Dakota.  It was great to get to know his parents better.  They are really neat people.  One of the highlights of the trip for me was going to North Dakota's famous musical in Medora.  Medora is this cute little town, close to the ND and Montana border.  The musical is so professional.  We also had the Pitch Frok Fondue BBQ (steak depfried on a pitch fork - actually pretty good).  We di other site seeing, like the Kernal Custered's house, Mandan Indian tribe replica, Lewis and Clark Fort Mandan, Peace Garden (on the ND/Canadian border).  The drive to and from ND was long and boring at times, although there was some amaxing scenory.  I think we plan to fly next time!  John's back down in Eugene for work.  I was around him constantly for two weeks, so its a little weired to have him gone for two days.  I think I'll go for a walk and get my allergy shots today.  J
