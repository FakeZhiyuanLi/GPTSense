						    I'm lying on the couch, watching a great episode of Matlock (which, by the way, airs on Hallmark, not on TBS, as I previously stated) and there are no dogs in sight.&nbsp; They're off in the office enjoying the big, red chair.&nbsp; I get concerned that I'm not paying enough attention to them.&nbsp; I get up.&nbsp; I leave the house to go to the grocery store.&nbsp; I come home.&nbsp; I greet the dogs.&nbsp;&nbsp;I go back to ignoring them.&nbsp; Later I feel guilty that I haven't given them enough attention.&nbsp; Should I feel guilty?&nbsp; Just because I'm here in the house with them pretty much all friggin' day?&nbsp; What happens to the dogs whose owners have jobs?&nbsp; Are they neglected simply because their "parents" are out and about for 8 or more hours a day?&nbsp; I don't think so.&nbsp; So why do I feel that my dogs are neglected when they get as little attention as the dogs who sit home alone all day?

						     I'm too young for CRS syndrome, so someone help me - what the hell is going on???   I went home to Brooklyn this past weekend. I packed enough dog food for three days and plenty of cookies for the girls. When I got to my parents' house, I realized that the food was not in my car. I left it on my counter in CT. This was odd because usually I am a very good packer and don't forget anything. But I didn't beat myself up over it because I figured the dog food was at the bottom of the barrel, and I could use a new bag, so I'd pick some up in NY and take it back to CT with me when I left. So this is what I did.  BUT  When I left for CT today, I forgot many, many things in NY. Because, like I said,  I am a total idiot!!!!    I left three dresses, a shirt, my hair dryer, my only brush, my comb, and all my make-up.&nbsp; Now the dresses and hair dryer aren't the biggest issues because 1) why am I going to need to wear a fancy dress in the near future and b) it's going to be a very rainy week and won't be worth it to straighten my hair because the rain will frizz it right up again.   BUT  as anyone who knows me can tell you, I am a BIG make-up person.&nbsp; I wear a 'full face' as they say (who is 'they' anyway???) every day of my life unless I am very ill or I know I am not leaving the house and no one's visiting me.&nbsp; So I ask you, what the hell am I going to do without make-up???&nbsp; How am I going to get to the store to buy some to tide me over?&nbsp; I guess my only hope is to not wash my face tonight and sleep on my back and hope I don't roll over and smush it all into the pillow.&nbsp; Maybe it would be easier just to go out without it on.&nbsp; Yeah, and maybe pigs will fly.   My lesson learned: Always have replacement items waiting at home when you travel in case you leave something behind and are too egotistical to go out in public  au natural .

						   My husband, Erik, is in the United States Navy.&nbsp; He's on a submarine right now, very far away, and has been for around four months.&nbsp; He's not expected home anytime soon.&nbsp; I miss him so much.&nbsp;  He's really nice to me when he's gone for so long.&nbsp; He was gone 6 months two years ago.&nbsp; He bought me a drawing to be framed, some Brooklyn brand gum from Italy, a beautiful leather bound journal, and sent flowers occasionally.&nbsp;  This time, I got flowers on our third anniversary, which is the second one he's&nbsp;been gone for&nbsp; He&nbsp;was away&nbsp;on&nbsp;our first anniversary, as well as his 23rd and 25th birthdays, poor guy.&nbsp; He sent me roses the other day for my half birthday (July 18 was my 26 1/2 birthday, in case you care) and so here are some pictures.&nbsp; The first is me smiling, because the flowers were so pretty, and I love when Erik does nice things.&nbsp; I guess anyone would love it when their husband did something nice.&nbsp; It's just doubly nice when I miss him so much and know it's going to be a while until I can thank him properly ;)   &nbsp;    urlLink     I'm happy!&nbsp; urlLink      This picture is a wee bit out of focus because I took it myself and I have shaky hands.&nbsp; Please ignore the out of focus part, and concentrate on the happy Dani part.&nbsp; Thanks.      urlLink    Artsy-fartsy shot of my flowers&nbsp; urlLink

						    Today the&nbsp;girlies got groomed.&nbsp; This&nbsp;meant a very early morning for me - they need to be dropped at the groomer at 8:00.&nbsp; That's usually when I wake up.&nbsp; So I had to get up at 7:00.&nbsp; But I was up in the middle of the night as I frequently am for unknown reasons.&nbsp; Around 4:00 (I think it was 4:04) I woke up and could not get back to sleep until&nbsp;I don't know when.&nbsp; I do know that the last time I looked at the clock it was 5:30 or so.&nbsp; The alarm was set for just an hour and a half later.&nbsp; I got to the groomer at 8:08.&nbsp; I did not over sleep.&nbsp; However I have been in a semi-trance-like state all day.&nbsp; When you go to bed at 1:00 , wake up&nbsp;three hours later for an hour and a half, and then get only another hour and a half sleep before you have to get up for real, it tends to throw off your whole day.&nbsp; At least I find it to be so.  At any rate, I had a house free of dog today.&nbsp; It was surprisingly pleasant.&nbsp; I get so used to having them around, but when it's a dog-free day, I miss them for the first half hour or so, and then I enjoy the silence.&nbsp; No barky-barks.&nbsp; No squeaking.&nbsp;&nbsp; No yelling at anyone to get off the furniture.&nbsp; No dragging any furry bodies away from the windows as they try desperately to get out and kill the squirrels.&nbsp; No interruptions as I sit at my desk.&nbsp; Brooklyn has a particularly awful habit of running in with a ball in her mouth and shoving it under my hip (I sit cross-legged on the chair - what we used to call Indian-style in the old PC free days) and waiting for me to notice so I can throw it out into the hallway so she can fetch it and bring it back and stow it under my hip.&nbsp;  So I was able to get the laundry done.&nbsp; I weeded my garden without any hairy animals barking at me from inside.&nbsp; I didn't have to walk anyone.&nbsp; I even got to watch a little bit of  Little House  and  Matlock .&nbsp; They're on TBS weekdays, if anyone's interested.&nbsp;  At around 3:40 I realized that I had to go get them.&nbsp; They were&nbsp;very excited to see me, as I was to see them.&nbsp; They are, after all, my babies.&nbsp; Once we got back to the house, they ran around for about 15 minutes    urlLink           Brooklyn going crazy    before conking out.  &nbsp; What a day they must have had.&nbsp; I'm sure it was as hectic and exciting for them as it was peaceful and quiet for me.   urlLink      Annie passed out&nbsp;  urlLink

						     Before I get into the smarts issue, my father has informed me that tsatskes is not a word, and that it should be spelled tschatschkes.&nbsp; I was originally thinking of spelling it tchachkes, but found it on a Yiddish lingo site spelled the way it ended up in yesterday's blog, so that's what I used.&nbsp; I feel that since Yiddish had its own alphabet (I think it was the Hebrew alphabet, or very close to it) that the English spelling is really irrelevant. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I got an email from my cousin today "bragging" about how well her dog is doing at school. * &nbsp; I wonder why my dogs are not quite so smart.&nbsp; Maybe it's because I didn't give them cerebral names like Ophelia (I'm not that creative) or maybe it's because they're inbred little bitches (that's not a swear in this case) and the more inbred you are, the dumber you are.&nbsp; I know several people who can attest to this. Haha.&nbsp;   Okay, maybe I exaggerated a wee bit.&nbsp; It's not that my dogs are actually stupid.&nbsp; They know their names, and recognize certain words, and can even do tricks.&nbsp; Here's a rundown of their abilities:      Brooklyn    Words/phrases she knows:   Bath  Wanna play? (meaning 'do you want to go outside and play catch?')  Wanna go for a walk?  Wanna go for a ride ?  Cookie  Ball  Toy  Bone  Go eat.  Go get some food.  Go drink.  Go get some water.  Want some dinner?  Want some food?  You want some?  Come.  C'mere.&nbsp;  Come on up! (as in get up on the bed)  Get down! (as in get off the bed.)  Go get it!  Go see!  Where is it?      Tricks she can perform:   Sit  Lie down  Roll over  Shake  Beg  Turn in a circle  She can also jump  really  high if you hold a ball over her head, but it's not a trick, just something cool she does.  Jump through a hoop  I have not yet attempted the blazing hoop trick, although tomorrow she's going to the groomer, so maybe I'll have them shave her bald so as to decrease the chance of setting her fur on fire when we do finally try the blazing hoop trick.&nbsp; Or not.     urlLink        Brooklyn Beg&nbsp;  urlLink           urlLink        Brooklyn Shake   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   Now Annie is our second dog.&nbsp; In the beginning, it was easy to say that she was dumber than Brooklyn because she was still a puppy.&nbsp; Seeing as she'll be 2 in about 4 weeks, I am not able to give any more excuses.&nbsp; She just is not as smart.&nbsp; Also, she has a problem with her back legs that keeps her from being able to jump very high or do cool tricks.   Annapolis    Words/phrases she knows   Kitty (Not an actual cat.&nbsp; It's a laser beam that she chases.&nbsp; This is why I think she's stupid.&nbsp; Brooklyn won't chase the laser.&nbsp; She barks her fool head off, knows exactly where the laser comes from and chases Annie with a toy in her mouth while Annie chases the beam.&nbsp; Dumb, yes?)  Cookie  Bone  Toy  Walk  Go eat.  Go get some food.  Go drink.  Go get some water.  Want some dinner?  Want some food?  Come get it.  Come here.  Come on up!  Get down!  You want some?  Go away. (usually said while I'm eating so that she'll stop staring at me)&nbsp;  Go see!  What was that? (In Annie's case, this usually elicits a short bark, as does 'Go see!')   Tricks she can perform:   Sit  Lie down  Shake hands  Circle  Now because she is dumb and also has the leg and&nbsp;obesity issue, she is not able to roll over.&nbsp; She never sprawls out on her back the way Brooklyn does.&nbsp; So when I was trying to teach her to roll over (which she kind of did before she got so fat) she got it into her head that substitutions are acceptable.&nbsp; If I made the hand motion for roll over, she would get up from her lying down position and turn around in a circle, thus affirming my theories on her stupidity and fat-/lazy-ness.&nbsp; It was so funny to me that I decided to teach Brooklyn to turn in circles, and now this is one of my favorite tricks of theirs.&nbsp; It's such a simple stupid thing, but it really makes me smile.     urlLink       Annie Shake&nbsp;  urlLink         So you be the judge.&nbsp; Are they really that stupid?&nbsp; Or am I (dammit that fly is back on my screen!&nbsp; More about that in a minute) being paranoid?&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  As to the flies, will, there is of course a story on that.&nbsp; There is a light outside my kitchen door that I turn on at night.&nbsp; All sorts of winged creatures flit about it all night long.&nbsp; I go to walk the dogs and leave through the kitchen.&nbsp; The dogs are slow to come inside, and&nbsp;the screen door isn't the kind that slams (it&nbsp;closes slowly) and so the flies and moths enter my house.&nbsp; They're impossible to get rid of.&nbsp; Just one more reason why you should never ever get a dog.&nbsp;     ;)    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more information about and pictures of Brooklyn and Annapolis, visit these sites:    urlLink  http://www.dogster.com/dog_page.php?i=24711&amp;j=t   urlLink       urlLink  http://www.dogster.com/dog_page.php?i=24712&j=t     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  * Stephanie - you know I'm just playing with you

						    Today my doggies got new food bowls.  At around 11:00 this morning, I looked down at the dog food bowls (and noticed they were still full from yesterday's morning meal) and decided that these skimpy plastic bowls just wouldn't do. So I remembered a store I had been into on a side street in Mystic (Pearl Street) that sold only dog - and some cat - related items, and pretty much nothing for those of the human persuasion. When I was in there a couple of weeks ago, I asked the proprietor how business was, being on a side street. She told me that it wasn't great, but the store was moving, and she expected it to pick up. However, she neglected to inform me where the store was moving, or when. She just said that it was moving to the main strip.&nbsp; So I drove down Pearl Street today, a woman on a mission, and was surprised to actually find a parking spot. Outside of New York, one might expect that parking is relatively easy, but Mystic is a hot tourist spot in the summer, and the main stretch is a traffic nightmare, especially every hour at a quarter to the hour when the drawbridge goes up. I found a parking spot and doubled back on Pearl toward the main strip on foot expecting to find the Curious Hound. I did not see it. It wasn't there. In the spot I thought it would be there was instead a needlepoint store. This upset me because I really hate exercise and didn't want to have to walk up and down the street looking for a store that might or might not exist there. Well, my stationery store where I bought all the materials for my sister-in-law's wedding invitations is there, and it's a lovely store, so I thought I would go in and browse, and chat with the proprietor of Everything but the Stamp. She has been very helpful and nice to me in the past, and I knew she'd be able to help me find the Curious Hound. But the stationery store was closed. It is Sunday, after all. Discouraged, I walked a little further down looking for the dog place, but didn't see it, so I stopped in at a leather shop. The guy at the desk had no idea what I was talking about (it seems that if you work on the main strip, you never really have to go onto the side streets, so it's as if they don't exist.) He thought I was talking about another store that he called the dog bakery. They bake items for dogs - they don't bake dogs. That place is next to Margarita's, and I think I might have to go there next time I'm in town. So once again I doubled back and went into an upscale women's store that had very nice clothes for someone a little older than I am, and I asked a kind lady who owned that shop if she had heard of this dog shop. She had! It turns out that the women's clothing store had recently vacated a building a little further down toward the drawbridge (I believe they said three stores from the bridge) and the Curious Hound had taken up renting in that building! So by sheer chance I had found the one person who would know where this store was. Finally.  I went into the store and found myself surrounded by things I never knew I needed. Or Annie and Brooklyn needed, rather. They had a nice assortment of dog food bowls, and the woman who owns the store was adorable! She's from England, but I don't know which part. She knew everything about all the things in her store, most of which are hand crafted and painted ceramic pieces. It's a great tsatskes store if you're a dog (and maybe cat) lover.  Brooklyn's dish says Dog Food Sucks, and Annie's says Feed Me Now because Brooklyn hates dog food, and Annie is always hungry. After all that, not only did they get new bigger bowls, but they got bowls that are very specific to their natures. Isn't that great?  I went home, transferred the food from the old bowls to the new, and wouldn't you know? they ate it up right away.  My lesson of the day: If you are motivated, you can always find exactly what you need/want.    urlLink       feed me now    urlLink       feed me now     urlLink       dog food sucks    urlLink       dog food sucks

						   Annapolis and Brooklyn&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink      Today Annie and Brooklyn did not eat their lunch or their dinner.&nbsp; I guess they had too much excitement to be hungry.&nbsp; I walked them a little late this morning (10:30) and they both peed and pooped.&nbsp; Around 11:00 am I was due to have about 10 girls come over to work on the banners for our boat's homecoming.&nbsp; Well, four people showed up at once, and I guess this was too much for Annie because she pooped on my dining room floor.&nbsp; Amanda pointed it out while she was still in action, so I was able to drag her outside by the scruff of her neck (Annie, not Amanda).&nbsp; I didn't have time to get a leash, but she didn't need one.&nbsp; She was still mid-doody, so she wandered out to the middle of the back yard and finished.&nbsp; Then she got praised.&nbsp; But the problem isn't with her training.&nbsp; She knows not to doody in the house.&nbsp; She just does it anyway.&nbsp; This was the third day in a row.&nbsp; I am really sick of this, you know?&nbsp; Well by the time all the girls were here, the dogs were incredibly riled up.&nbsp; I tried locking them in my bedroom, but they made such a ruckus!&nbsp; So once we humans went outside to start painting, I fed the canines and let them roam free in the house.&nbsp; I was a little reluctant because a) I don't want them on my brand new furniture and 2) I didn't want to risk someone opening the door and having one of the pups run onto a freshly painted banner.&nbsp; It's a little bit difficult to remove acrylic paint from dog hair (yes hair, not fur - they're cocker spaniels).&nbsp; So where was I?&nbsp; Oh yeah, I fed them.&nbsp; But they just weren't interested.&nbsp; The food is still sitting out there in their bowls.&nbsp; They did drink a lot of water today, though.&nbsp; It was really hot out, and when they get excited, they get hot, too.&nbsp; It's okay if they skip a meal though.&nbsp; You see, Annie is about 7 pounds overweight (that's around 1/4 of what her weight should be) and Brooklyn is 2 pounds overweight.&nbsp; The food is actually diet food.&nbsp; I guess that's why they don't like it.&nbsp; Hmm, is there an Atkins plan for dogs?

						    Well, some people have expressed the opinion that I am a little irrational concerning my dogs. I think too much about them, or I dote too much, or I treat them too much like my babies. Well, I have a little to say about that. First of all, I don't currently have any children, so I am free to give the dogs my undivided attention. Someday, this might not be so - Erik and I might decide to make new people, and if that happens, then the dogs might not get as much love and attention as they do now. So why not heap it upon them while I have the chance? Also, I am certainly not the only one who is crazy when it comes to pets. Take my father, for instance. He actually bought some sort of cat carrier to wear on his person - like a Baby Bjorn that mothers wear. Who's crazy now?

						   Today was Annie's birthday. She turned two years old. In dog years, I guess she's 14. I can't tell from the way she acts that she's supposedly a teenager. I mean, she's still a puppy! Aside from the pooping in the house - which she did again twice last week - there's the chewing on Brooklyn's ear while chasing a ball, the whining, the always wanting to be in my lap, the ability to tune out direct commands such as "No!" and "Come here!", the chewing up tissues, the list goes on and on.  She's  such  a puppy. Which brings me to a question I've been pondering for about a year now. You know how retarded  people  stop developing mentally past a certain age? Well, I wonder if this happens with dogs, and if so, is Annie developmentally challenged? Is there such a thing as a retarded dog? For those of you who have met my sweet (kind of slow) dog, you might know what I'm talking about.  As for the rest of you, all you have to go on is either what I've posted on here, or what I've told you about in other formats.  But please, let me know! Is Annie a  special  dog, or what? Okay, now let's all sing happy birthday to my little fat princess.   Happy birthday to you.     Happy birthday to you.     Happy birthday dear Annapolis.     Happy birthday to you.     And many moooooooore.     Arroooooooooooooh!     Yip yip yip!     Awooooooo!

						    My dogs' tags are Shrinky-dinks. About a month ago, I was at Fin and Feather, the pet store/pet supplies store where we bought Annie, and where I frequently buy the girls their toys, collars, and leashes, and I was looking for the Shrinky-dink tags, but they were out. I was utterly devastated by this because I have a lot of time on my hands (as some of you might already have been aware) and I was really looking forward to writing out their new tags and then putting them in the toaster oven and watching them shrink. But alas, this was not to be. The lady at the counter took my name and number and told me that I'd receive a phone call from them when the new ones came in. I promptly forgot all about it and for the next month, never even thought about their tags. A few days ago, I received a phone call (just like the lady said I would!!!) telling me that they had 15 different types of tags to choose from!!! I was so excited that I drove over there right away and bought them their new tags. Annie's has a dog with a ball in its mouth, and Brooklyn's is covered with pastel daisies. They are simply fetching. Ha. I made a pun. (Annie's has a dog with a ball, they are 'fetching', get it??) While I was there, I also picked up a couple of rope toys and some treats that a friend of mine asked me to get for her dog. I kind of owed her one because I was driving along the road one day on my way home, and passed her house. She was outside mowing her lawn, and I thought it would be cute to startle her. I held the horn down really long and totally freaked her out. She jumped about a foot in the air and told me that I scared the crap out of her. Seeing as I only meant to scare her a little bit, and not actually extract fecal matter from her tuchas, I felt a bit bad about the whole thing and offered to pick up something for her if she needed it. Well, her doggy, Polly, a boxer mutt, was very excited to get the treats, and Brooklyn and Annie were overjoyed at the prospects of new necklaces and new toys.  All in all it was a very satisfactory day for the girlies and me.
