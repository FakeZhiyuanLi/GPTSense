       As I strolled into the mall yesterday, gently bypassing the group of about 10 8th grade (well now freshmen) girls who were congregating in front of the Electronics boutique, I had a certain glimmer in my eye - Madden '05 had just come out, and I was about to purchase it. However, to my dismay, the stiffs at EA Sports dellayed the release of the computer version of the popular video game until September 9th. I was nearly in tears... What game was I going to play when I got back to my house? I went to J-crew to try and think things off, and got a nice tie there (althought it wasn't the one I wanted) and my short term memory sudenly kicked in. I remembered that just a few hours earlier I had a red an article about this computer game about political campaigning. It had seemed hilarious, with the capabilities of pitting thomas jefferson against  the "guvanator" I laughed whole heartedly. Naturally at this point I felt the distinct need to buy it. I rushed back to EB, past the pack of gigling girls (by now they had recognized me) I pushed aside a small child (not really, but it makes it dramatic does it not?) and picked out the game.      From then on, it was bliss. In my first campaign, I ran myself against the guvanator, and lost. But it was close. I would have one, if not for Ahnould's last minute grab of new york. I even won Texas! In my second game, I possessed the poise and experience nesecairy to win it all. I clobbered Barbara Bush. She won Montana, Colorodo, and South Carolina... That was it! I finished with over 500 electoral votes, and over 95 million popular votes.. I was trully the champion. Today I will embark upon a campaign that features appearances on "Night time, with Fred Toppel" "The O'maley Factor" "Hardhitter" "Barry King Live" "60 Seconds" and of course "Barbara Sawyer".. The Political machine is simply a marvelous game, and I recomend it to anybody, whether interested in politcs or not.      To summarize, 8th grade girls need to stop giggling whenever they see me, EA Sports is a bunch of stifs, and "The Political Machine" is the best game of all time, not Madden 05'

      The day we have all been waiting for has finally arrived... Well, sort of. When trying to find out the release date of the Passion, I came upon a marvelous discovery. On Noveber the 22nd Seasons One, Two, and Three, of SEINFELD will be available for purchase via DVD. Words can not describe how happy I was to hear this. I immediatly rank this day amoung my top five days of my life, and I've had some pretty good times. There's simply no limit to the amound of good this has done in the world, and quite frankly, I'm thinking of forgoing the entire 2nd half of the month of November in order to watch all the episodes... Again, and again!

       First off, let me say once and for all that Les Mis is far superior to Phantom of the Opera in every way..      Well, not that any of you can tell, but I've been sitting here for about three minutes to try and come up with a second line; so I supose I shall just move on...      Back to the Political Machine, for those of you who went out and bought it, good job! I've got a few funny characters i can send you if you so desire. Namely: Arlen Spector, Rick Santorum, Marvin the Martian, Hitler, Mckain, JFK, and im working on Osama. In just a little while the ultimate showdown between Adolf Hitler, and Osama Bin Laden will begin. At stake - The American Presidecy. The winner - well either way we're screwed ;) But it sounds really funny!

      “No one is happy relatively - for a longer or shorter time. You’re happy or you’re not. That’s all. And death has nothing to do with it - death is an accident of happiness, in that case.” - Albert Camus   The above quote was pulled from Mr. Camus first novel "A Happy Death" and to me, it says alot. It corellates well with my "death is just another stage of life" philosophy. Camus recognizes that death is inevitable and should'nt factor in to your hapines. In other words, one should not worry about death. I wrote alot more on the subject, but I thought it sounded stupid so I deleted it (not that I don't recognize how stupid this post sounds anyway, atleast there's a good quote). Just haven't really had anything inspired to say since i've been writting this limitations piece, it seems to be taking up the wole good half of my brain.       Alas, enjoy Mr. Camus, and go read all of his books (which i will hencefourth rank in ascending order of goodness):       1. The First Man (a controversial choice, due to its lesser noteriety, but my favorite nonetheless).    2. The Stranger (His most critically acclaimed book, a book which neithr I, nor the man who works the counter at Barnes and Noble could figure out).    3. The Plague (Rusty's favorite, think Nazis).    4. A Happy Death (his First Novel, genuienly bizare, many consider it his precursor to The Stranger   5. The Fall (Still a Great book, just without the certain flair that characterizes his other works)   6. All of his other books which I have't read (The Rebel, The myth of the Sissyphus, Calligula and three other plays, I think he wrote some essays which have been published too, and his notebooks have been published, though i'm not sure if they've been published in English)      To summarize my thoughts on Camus, I shall say that he was "simply the best" and its a horrible shame that he died before being able to grace us with more of his genious.

       Ok, so i've got about a page worth of material so far on limations, but I haven't yet actually hit the meat of my argument, so I decided i'll just focus on writting it out (much in the style of my "Discourse on the Soph Hop") and then I'll post it as an attachment with a breif summary in my blog... It's coming along nicely, a bit jambled (I'm horribly out of practice with my writting, as you can undoubtebly tell) but I do make some compelling points.

       One thing i've learned about this country in the aftermath of the McGreevey resignation, which quite frankly shocks me, is that 15% of mariages survive one partner admiting that they're gay. 15% of maigiages do not end as a result of one partner coming out of the closet.... 15% of mariages continiue even though one partner is gay? Pardon me for being a bit naive on the subject, but, what the hell? I might be a bit judeo-christian on this one, but shouldn't people who are maried atleast be attracted to the sex of their partner? I've heard of loveless mariages, but this statistic takes the cake. I cannot fathom how someone can be maried to someone of the opposite (or even the same) sex, unless they are attracted to that sex. Talk about defending mariage... I think it's time we called in Ricky boy on this one...

       So I get home from work yesterday to find that I have two items from the mail. The first, being my monthly J-Crew catalogue, I quickly devowered, while the second, I had to think twice about. It was a letter from a beloved/beleagured president. It was your standard campaign letter, thanking me for my continiued support, and asking for a charitable donation to the "Bush-Chenney foundaion". I even got a cool " 'W' in '04! " bumper sticker, which i intend to place proudly somewhere at AFS (take that liberal thesbians!). However, I do find it rather interesting that I've managed to slip onto their mailing list. This is my second such letter (who could forget the infamous "George-Laura autographed photo", which is now resting proudly in my top drawer) since the campaign has begun. It is highly humorous to me, because I am in no way a Republican, and given almost any other man running under the democratic ticket, I would endorse him and not Bush. Secondly, I am a minor, and thusly, it is illegal for me to contribute financially to their campaign.       The predominant thought, as I hastilly compiled a letter (telling them to stop asking me for money, because I can't, and won't give any) was how in the heck was my name ever put on their list. I'm neither a wealthy buisnessman, nor a Christian supremist living in the Midwest, so why are the republicans interested in me? Am I to asume that former socialists, attending Quaker schools, who have harshly critisized Bush in the past, are prime candidates for Bush campaigners? Is Republican logic so fundamentally flawwed that despite that fact they have nearly double he campaign money tha the democrats do, they still need to heckle 16 y/o's for chump change? I mean, even if I were to give them the minimun gift of $25, does that really make a difference considering they allready have over $250 million?       ..... And to think, this is the party i'm endorsing for the upcoming election.. Where have you gone Bill Clinton? Constitutional Amendment against gay mariage? I think we need a Constitutional Amendment allowing presidents more than two terms.

       Hey, I've been talking with a few people about the limitations of our world, and the comparisons and teachings that we can glean from it. So I decided to dedicate my next posting to the subject. For now, I will just leave you with this saying I thought of "limitations are wraught from the human mind, not the human condition", I'll finish later.. Have fun with it

       There are a few old movies that I would like to give props to. First and foremost, my first ever movie: Milo and Ottis... Don't ask me what it's about, I hav'evnt the slightest of clues, but being my first movie, I thought I should mention it. Secondly, my second ever movie, Aliens (the 2nd one with the marines in it). What a cool movie. I mean, come on, Aliens, marines, cool, space age guns, what could be better? I remember having dreams where I was in my grand parents house (because thats where I'd allways watch the movie) and I would have one of those neato "pulse action riffles" from the movie, and I'd be running around killing aliens. What a great movie, so great, in fact, that I am seing Aliens Versus Predators on Friday.. What fun! And Finally, the mother of all movies "Ghostbusters!" Simply a classic. Whether it's the first or the second, it all kicks ass. They even had a computer game, back when computers still hooked up to tv's. Man was that a fun game, you got to pick your car, and your equip, and run around the city fighting the stay-puffed marshmellow man.. Alright, those are my thoughts for the day, no newspaper, so no new anti-Kerry rants. That'l be another day.. Adios..

       Hey everyone! This is my blog, another product of my mindless days here at work. In the upcoming days/months/etc I will be posting on a semi-routine basis on topics such as: new clothes i may have purchased, the latest Red Sox quandry, how much the Yankees suck, Rick Santorum, John Kerry: The portrait of a dumbass, George Bush: The portrait of a dumber-though-should-still-be-our-president-ass, and anything else I feel like (because, well, I can!)... Hope you all enjoy, I know at some point i'm going to say something interesting on here.    - l8er

       That's it, after four days without going on a John Kerry rant, I think it's about time to put shoty back in his place. While visiting Grand Canyon with his wife John Kerry (in typical fashion) vowed to devote more money to our Fledgling Fedeeral Park system. This idea, was met with wide applause (naturally, seing as the audience were national park goers) but I question the meaning behind this promise. In typical election year fashion, Kerry once again makes an empty promise that stirs up a fervor amoung potential voters. In trademark style (might as well give Kerry a flashy logo and stamp it on anything he says or does) Kerry makes an appealing promise, without any thought or true agenda behind it. Kerry fails to realise, or perhaps fails to adress, the lofty financial responsibilities needed to validate such a promise, and instead favors empty promises and purple hearts. Americans need to wake up and realise that a man who voes against increasing funding for our troops in Iraq, and yet in his acceptance speech promises to send in 40,000 more troops (while also pledging that he has an exit plan, though never actually telling the public what that it), can never be a fiscally responsible president. Kerry assails Bush for his record defecits, and he's right, in the past Bush has'nt been fiscally responsible in any sense of the word. However, Kerry's economics do nothig to substntiate his claims that he is a more fiscally responsible president. While Kerry promises to "cut the federal defecit in half, quicker (another vague-Kerry-staple word) then the Republicans!" He plans to do so while raising exspenses in several areas, and cutting taxes in the middle class. True he does plan to roll back tax cuts in the upper class, but with the far greatr number of americans who would benefit from middle-class tax cuts, versus the number of americans who would be adversly affected by repealing Bush's tax cuts; I question whether little to any new revenues would be gained from this endeaveur. Kerry promises a brighter future, but what he really wants is a brighter-coloured house...
