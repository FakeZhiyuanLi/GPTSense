           Evening; guys!!      This is the start of the blog!    Over the coming time; I'm going to keep adding my daily experiences; sorta like a diary. Oh well; if you get bored do tell and I'll do something interesting!    Gotta love that. And here we go with day one:     28 July 2004     I've just started getting over my lesion (a big lump of blood sitting at the back of my head). I hit my head in maths because of some random accident; all good. But I've got a subarachnoid cyst and any hits to the back of my head can kill me; so we got it checked out with a CT scan. It's all good but; it's just a bruise sorta thing. I had a headache for years on end (actually, 2 days) and it's just starting to fade now.    If one good thing did come out of it, I got to read a great book. It's called  Incompetence  by  Rob Grant . Worth the read. Here's a great line from it:                                               Now, my experience of near death situations - that experience being, as you know, more than copious - is that once your adrenaline settles, and you realise you've actually lived through it, you undergo the most incredible high. You're in love with the world, with life itself. All malice flies from your spirit. You want to write, personally, to everyone who was ever even slightly mean to you and forgive them. You want to swim with dolphins. You want to run naked on beaches. You want to frolic naked in heather. You want to throw back your head and laugh for forty minutes out of every hour. You want to make love through the night, every night, and you don't care who or what with. You want to be reckless. You want to parachute in blizzards, naked. Fly unpowered gliders, blindfold and naked. You want to ski down sheer glaciers, blindfold and naked and without skis. You want to ride untamed horses, possibly blindfold though probably not naked, and definately without skis. You're high, but you're not insane. You want to get together all the world leaders, possibly naked, and bang their silly old heads together till they agree that war is a stupid thing and they're definately going to stop doing it. You're so giddy, you actually think you might pull it off, too.               I'm guessing everyone's experience is reasonably similar, though I'll accept maybe my reaction is overly focused on excessive nakedness. I've no idea why that is   .            The book is great; but it's fucking hilarious. Worth the read.    Go Australia in the Athens Olympics! Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be watching the cycling.  Wink wink.    Adam
