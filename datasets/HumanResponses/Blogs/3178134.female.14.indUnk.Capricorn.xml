       urlLink This is an excellent article  on why gay marriage is not the right thing for my state or country. It's also very long, but well worth it.

      I really don't have the time at the moment to write my argument out myself, but  urlLink here's a link  to an article that talks about how gay marriage could have an effect on traditional marriage; it doesn't talk about all the aspects of this topic, but it touches on some of them. It's from Focus on the Family's Citizen, so it is Christian.

      On Monday (I’m pretty sure it’s Monday) my state will have legalized gay marriage. It’s an interesting thought; I don’t want it but, unfortunately there’s not much we (or I) can do about it. We can do a lot of talking and debating, but it won’t make any difference. So I’ll just sit back, relax and see what’s going to happen. I just wonder how it will affect me, directly. How will it affect Massachusetts? Will it have any affect on me? I guess I’ll find out soon enough. I doubt it will affect me much initially, but maybe as time goes by, I’ll see what it has done. My general response when I talk about it is sarcarm. All the poeple I know and talk about it with are conservative, so I just sulkiy and sarcastically say: "What, you're not excited to belong the first state to have legalized gay marriage?" Sarcasm seems to be my only tactic to respond to it.

      When I don’t post it’s usually because of this:  I wanted to watch a movie, And check a site on-line, 	 But then my mother told me,  “You can’t! Look at the time.”  “It’s half past ten,” my mother said, “It’s time for you to be in bed.” I never liked that clock, I thought. And now I wish that it would stop.  When my homework is complete, My Mother says to go to sleep! And always when my work is done, There’s no more time for any fun. (By Abigail Murdy, May 10, 2004)  Well, it communicates the general idea, at any rate.

      My mother just finished reading Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte. I had been pestering her to read this book, because I love it so much, and she finally gave in. We were discussing it after she’d finished it, and it made my think of an aspect which many good novels share. It’s the idea of putting a character in the story for means of comparing him to the main character, or giving another perspective. Take Pride and Prejudice for example. Jane Austen frequently makes a statement about marriage with her novels. In Pride and Prejudice she highlights Lizzie and Darcy’s relationship by putting in couples like Mr. and Mrs.Bennet, or Mr. and Mrs.Collins to compare them with. It adds a different dimension to reading (or writing) a book. I really like literature, by the way, if you haven’t noticed. I do intend to write about other things, once I’ve gotten my thoughts together on them.

      I was thinking more about what I wrote earlier (What Would A Novel Be Without Sin?). I think if we didn't have sin, not only would we lose those wonderful good vs. evil plots, but we'd lose the interesting part of our characters. If everyone was perfect, than we wouldn't have the interest of our sins combined with our virtues to make characters with struggles that are unique to who they are but similar to ours in the fact that we are human. I think that some of the most interesting things in novels are the characters' flaws and virtues and how they drive the plot, rather than the plot driving them. Does that make any sense? Oh well, sometimes my thoughts flow too fast for words to express them with clarity.

       My friend Catherine is back and we're going to continue our debate about modern vs. classic literature.   A: Ummm..where did we leave off? Oh yeah, you had said that you can relate to characters in modern literature more because they can experience things that you do. But the reason classic literature has survived so long and people still love it, is that the characters, even though they don't experience the same things we do, they at least experience the same emotions, which ties the centuries together.  C: I agree with you that classics have survived this long, but we need NEW old classics, so that in a century from now people will look at modern stuff and call it classic. Also in classic lit you have to think of reasons why you can relate to them, but in modern books its obvious. So why waste brain juice? (in case you didn't notice that’s really my only good point so I'm sticking to it)  A: Ok, first, I totally agree with you that we need “NEW old classics” (and I intend to write them.) But in centuries from now, according to your theory, people will relate to modern literature. How can that be? Centuries from now things will be different and people just like you will say, “I don’t like classic literature from the 21st century, I can’t relate to it, the people in those books don’t do anything like we do and I can’t relate to them.” The idea of classic literature is that it has themes and emotions that despite the circumstances carry on because we’re all human and that is they only thing that doesn’t change throughout the centuries. Modern literature is much more action oriented, with plot coming before character, which makes it very unlikely that they will be classics: they don’t have enduring themes. They speak to an audience which doesn’t like to take the time to think about things and that will be it’s ultimate down fall. To write classic books we need to read the ones we already have and study them, because they’ve proven their worth over time.    Catherine has to leave now, so that's the end of this part of our debate, but we'll have more later.

      If you've ever seen the classic movie Casablanca you'll know what I'm raving about. If you haven't then I strongly advise that you do, and if you have seen it and didn't like it I regard you as less than human. I'm writing this at 11:00 PM, after just watching it for the first time. I was slightly wary at the beginning because I knew two things, one its an old movie, so the characters are always well developed and you learn to love them and, two, its a World War II movie so somebody's going to die. But, it was recommended in World Magazine's 50 Best Movies, so I knew it was a must-see, whether I liked it or not. The funny thing is that even with its not-so-typical-Hollywood ending, (which I ususally don't like) it has captured my imagination, and has me completely under its spell. I can't say more, or I'll say too much.

      Yesterday in the car I was looking at the cars driving by and noticed, not for the first time, the bumper sticker that  reads, "United We Stand". It struck me as ironic, for our nation is anything  but  united. I mean there's disagreement about gay marriage, abortion, the war, the Patriot Act, the Under God issue, and just about everything else. On almost every issue our nation is divided, instead of united. Even regarding 9/11 we are divided: some think it was all Bush's fault and others think he was not at all to blame. Republicans vs Democrats, Liberals vs Conservitives, how can you have these disagreements and still put a bumper sticker on your car that says "United We Stand"?

      The mail arrived today, and World Magazine didn't come, so all I had to look at was a Lands End catalog. As I was flipping through the pages I saw a 4th of July section with patriotic clothing. One shirt had the words "I pledge allegiance to the flag of The United States of America". I remembered that last year for the 4th of July section they had a shirt with the  entire  pledge on it. Apperently, they don't want to get involved in the "Under God" debate. I wish people could just let things like the pledge alone! Our country has bigger issues to focus on. Erasing God's name isn't going to erase his existance, no matter how many people would like to think it would.

      If man had never sinned, books would be pretty boring. Understand me, I'm not saying that  sin , or evil, is in anyway  good , but surely life without it would be less interesting. How could you write a murder mystery without sin existing to make someone commit the murder in the first place? So...perhaps God initially let man sin so that we could have interesting books? No, I'm sure there was a better reason. But still that's something to puzzle about. Without a knowledge of evil the wonderful books, and movies too, would lose their great good striving against evil plots! Of course, in this odd post-modern era, there are those who would say there is no objective good and evil, and that what is good and what is evil are all subjective, and depend only one's own  personal preferences . If  that  was true, again, we wouldn't have very interesting books either because the good vs. evil plot would be all according to our own whims, so that would be boring too.

      About 1/3 of me is an aspiring writer (I won't say what the other 2/3's are though). I've had writer's block for a while, at least a block for fiction. Anyway, that block has, thankfully, been removed. A few weeks ago I had a great idea for a story, which could easily work itself into a novel. Before I began any writing, though, I just thought about the plot for a few days. When some flesh had started to appear on the bones of the story, I made a basic outline and plot summary. Then, two days ago, I started to work on writing the first chapter. I had the names of my characters and how they would change and develop over the course of the story, but as I started to write, I realized that though I knew where the characters were going, I didn't know where they came from. In other words, I knew how they would change over the course of the story, but I didn't know what they would change from. So I have again put the writing part aside, until I know the characters well enough to do justice to them. I've never read any books about writing a book, or anything like that, so I don't pretend to have any knowledge on the subject, other than that which I've gained from my own personal experience, and from what I've read of other's fiction. But I know that had I continued to write without really knowing who I was writing about, I'd never be able to achieve any character development that would penetrate an audience.

      My family and I are really fond of old, classic movies. A few nights ago we all watched  Mr.Smith Goes to Washington . I hadn't seen this before and really enjoyed it. Despite the soppy title, and the fact that it was made in 1939, it is totally relevant to the 21st century. It's about an "idealistic, small town senator who heads to Washington and suddenly finds himself single-handedly battling ruthless politicians out to destroy him." (That's the description on the back of the videocase.) Jimmy Stewart excellently plays the main character, Jefferson Smith. He comes to the job of senator without any previous experience to prepare him for the world of politics, and when he discovers the corruption existing there, instead of falling into it himself, he attempts to make others realize who's really running things in the senate. When you look at how much the media and big lobbies, such as Planned Parenthood and teachers' unions, have to do with who gets elected around here, you see that things aren't so different now than they were back then.

      The President is getting a ton of abuse by those who disagree with him. People say he could have prevented 9/11, and say he takes womens rights away by preventing partial birth abortion, and takes away the rights of homosexuals by being against their right to marriage. The media protrays him in the darkest light it can. His opponent, John Kerry, abuses his intelligence and everything else about him. These people may disagree with him but does that mean that they should demean him so harshly with their language? The President of the United States of America, whoever he may be, deserves respect for at least two reasons.  One , he was voted into office by the people. That means that over half of America wants this man to be president. That deserves respect.  Two , the job of President is a tough one. It's even tougher when there's such an abusive media. It's even tougher when there's been a large terrorist attack on your country. It's even tougher when there's a war going on. Any President who demonstrates a desire to do what is right and best for his country despite the conquences, should be respected, because no matter if we disagree with him, he's doing what he's doing for our good. However the media seems two disregard, if not totally forget these points. If our President next term is John Kerry than he too deserves respect for the two above reasons, and he should get that respect even if he does not return it to the unborn children of America. It is ironic that the liberals who so passionately preach tolerence also so passionately abuse a man like President Bush who had done little to deserve it. President Bush has never been heard demeaning Clinton, who came before him and un- doubtedly made his job harder for him.

      I was thinking about the debate my friend Catherine and I had (see Literature Debate, Part 1) and why classics are worth our time and why they should be read. My agrument is pretty simplistic, but, I hope, convincing. Just the fact that these books have survived and are still being read to the present day, seems a good reason to read them. They've been around for hundreds and hundreds of years and in some cases thousands of years, and despite their age people still read them, and love and learn from them. There must be something special in these books that makes them survive. Our surroundings now are so vastly different from when these books were written, that it seems that what these books hold in them that makes them survive is beyond the material part of our life. The one common bond between the lives led by the characters in the stories and ours now is our humanity, and surely core human nature and emotions cannot change so easily as our surroundings can. The reason these books are read and people can relate to the characters is because the characters are human, and the author has captured what does not change over the centuries: human emotion and nature. We feel what the character feels because however different the circumstances are that bring them about, the emotions and reactions are ours as well. Another reason why we should read the classics is for the sake of history and perspective. If we read only modern books then we would be restricted by our narrow-mindedness. Reading books written in the past gives us a different perspective to look through. We begin to see our life now, not for itself, but as it has been affected by everything that has gone before us. We begin to see the failure of our modern age and see what we have come from. The majority of classic literature comes from a time when there was no television, radio, or computer. There was more time to focus on life and humanity and many other things. Shouldn't we listen to what these authors have to say, they who took the time to write and study well? Or should we lock ourselves up to our own time, which is but a drop in a bucket of water? The age we live in now is one of action and immediate reward with the least amount of work possible to get there. The books written now are written to an audience which wants read a book and have it fly past like a movie. We have a short attention span which leaves little time for character development. Good movies are great things, but a book is not a movie and a movie is not a book. So why should a book imitate a movie? Those who write today shouldn't write movies, they should write books, and good books too, or else our age will be forgotten. There is a Latin proverb that goes something like this, "The man who does not read good books has no advantage over the man who cannot read them."

      I was watching some of the extra "stuff" that comes along with the Extended DVD of The Two Towers. In the interview I was watching Peter Jackson and some others were talking about Smeagol, and the comment was made that Smeagol was blameless as to how he acted because of the ring. To some extent this is true, especially when he's guiding Sam and Frodo to Mordor, because the ring had very complete posession of him at that point. But when he first took the ring and killed his fellow hobbit for it, was that a blameless act? You could say the ring made him do that too, but did Frodo kill Bilbo to get the ring? Or did Sam kill Frodo to the same end? Smeagol is a pitiable character, but he was different than Frodo, Bilbo and Sam to begin with and is not totally blameless for his actions.

       Ok, I and my friend, Catherine, are going to have a debate on Modern vs. Classic Literature, and which is better.   A: I think classic literature is way better than modern literature.   C: I feel like I can relate to characters more in modern literature, because they go through the same things we do.  A: I  believe classic literature developes characters better for many reasons. One, classic books are usually longer than modern books, and they take more time to concentrate on character. Two, modern books seem to focus on action more than on character, like in a movie, and classic books develope character first and then bring in the plot to add to the character rather than vice versa.  C: lol...yeah, this is great.umm...I like modern books better cuz like  I said I relate to them more. they go through things like depression, bad grades, family problems, & social problems (friends radomly ignoring you) those sort of things.  To be continued.....  Catherine and her Mom come over to our house on Mondays and Wednesdays to study Grammer, Logic and Science together, so we'll be debating again on Monday.

      Cathrine Rollin is a big composer in the world of music for piano students. Today my piano teacher along with a couple others had a recital in her honor and all of the students (including me) played Ms.Rollin's music. It was interesting to hear a lot of music all by the same composer at the same time. Some pieces were better than others, but they all shared the same bond of being sentimental, so that by the end we, or I was at least, longing for something with a little more depth and subtleness. Bach would be a great relief, something with a little more power. I flatter myself that the two peices I played were some of the least sentimental. At the end a student complimented Ms.Rollin by comparing her with Beethoven; I think that is more of an insult to Beethoven than a complimant to her. Sentimentality is not bad, but I can only stand so much of it.

      MassHOPE (Massachusetts Homeschool Organization of Parent Educators) had a big conference today which we went to. It was really interesting, and it was especially encouraging to see all the others who homeschool. Homeshooling is awesome, but sometimes you need the support of knowing there are others who are dealing with some of the same difficulties and challenges. And just being around lot of other kids my own age was great. There were many different workshops you could go to. I thought the best of the ones I attended were led by a man named Jay Wile, who wrote the great science curriculum we use. He did a lecture on Creation vs. Evolution which was excellent.

      As a big Lord of the Rings fan I was really excited when the Fellowship of the Ring came out in theaters. I was 11 when I saw it and it was the first PG-13 movie that my parents had permitted me to see. (I'm 14 now and I've only seen five movies with that rating) Now that all three of the movies have been released, I'm trying to figure out how I feel about them. Overall I think Peter Jackson did a very good job.  But , there were some things I was disapointed with.   1. Of course a film based on Tolkien's books would have to be violent. But the film should not concentrate on the violence of the book at the expence of the dialogue. I don't think that was so much the case in The Fellowship of the Ring, but in The Two Towers and The Return of the King it was more of a factor.  2. The Return of the King left out several major parts that I think should have been left in. The fact that Denathor was using the Palantir adds a different demention to his maddness. And especially the ending with the shire being untouched. That really needs to be fixed.  3. Faramier has always been one of my favorite characters. I admit that I like him even better than Aragorn. So I was very annoyed when The Two Towers came out and he was portrayed as the exact image of his brother. The same greed and weakness infested the spotless character of Faramier. Is someone less interesting because they're good?  So those are some of my disapointments. Here are some of the  many  good parts.  1. The casting was  excellent . All the cast fit into the characters they played perfectly. The acting, too, was excellent.  2. The scenery and sets were just as a reader would imagine them. 3. Gollum was the star of the show! Really he was portrayed wonderfully. The Gollum and Smeagol conversation in The Two Towers was perfect. He was supurbly done.

      Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors. From the first page of Pride and Prejudice, I have been a Janeite. But I've always been surprised at how few fans of hers there are that are men. G.K.Chesterton said she was one of the only novelists of her time that could "sensibily and cooly discribe a man." Also it is interesting to note that she grew up with six brothers and only one other sister.  urlLink Male Voices in Praise of Jane Austen  is a wonderful site with more info on this topic. Also at this site is a collection of quotes from famous men about Jane Austen.

Can't he just shut up and  try  to persuade us of his own!

      In school we're reading King Arthur. It's rather ironic how much killing the noble and honorable Knights of the Round Table did. Merlin is, at the moment, my favorite character. He reminds me of Gandalf, from Lord of the Rings. King Arthur, however, is nothing like Aragorn. Aragorn is so much stronger as far as character is concerned. King Arthur, at least in the first four chapters, doesn't heed Merlin's advice and ends up killing one of his knights and almost dying himself.

      This evening we had a piano recital. I didn't do particularly well, but then again I absolutely hate the piece I played, and it is not the sort of piece that does credit to anyone's ability whether it is played well or not. If you've never been to or played at a typical piano rectial you might want to consider it. It's not that it's an informing of enlighting experience, but it's just so down-to-earth homely. They always start out with the little kids who sit on the piano bench and their feet don't touch the floor. They loudly plunk out some melody or other, usually things like 'Lullaby' or 'Detective Song'. Then there will be some brilliant youngster who makes you feel ashamed of yourself because he plays so well at his age. Then there's a string of twelve-year-olds with varying performances. After that comes the teenagers who barely nod to the applauding audience and slump off the stage without bowing. (There are some exceptions to that rule--my friend, Jenna and myself, for example.) Finally it ends with the old student who plays a very impressive piece from memory. This is the general pattern for typial recitals.

      I've started Willa Cather's  The Song of the Lark , and I'm already really enjoying it. I started it yesterday; I'm on the eleventh chapter and I'm already very interested in the characters. It's not just what happens next to the characters, but it's the character in the book  themselves  that are so interesting. They're living, breathing people, not just vague sketchy portraits. Their characters don't even have to be developed because they just  are . These characters are so interesting that blogging pales in comparison. So I'll stop here.

      I was just thinking about the way love is portrayed in our culture, and running over various movie plots in my head, and most of the time there's never any love after getting to know one another. It's love at first sight, that sort of thing. There's not enough focus on character to explain why the guy and girl are meant for each other. If thats what love is than no wonder 50% of first marriages end in divorce.

      I've realized that my life falls to pieces when I'm not reading a good book. You may think I'm exagerating, but I am in earnest. Every time I go for a month without reading a good old novel for myself (as opposed to for school) I start to get depressed, discontented, unmotivated, moody, and bored with life's daily tedious drone. I'm feeling that way right now because for over a month I haven't been reading anything for myself, but I'm thinking of reading Willa Cather's The Song of the Lark. It has a sentimental title, but I've heard it's really good and it's about a girl who lives in a rustic town and wants to be a singer. Already the main character has some similarities to myself.

      I was listening to a CD with all Chopin on it, and it's just some of the most amazing music I've ever heard. Really, when I say words just aren't good enough I mean it. His music is so powerful, it's hard to believe it's human. I love classical music, but lately I've just fallen in love with Chopin. My piano teacher says she fell in love with him when she was my age too, so I guess it's not that unusual, (for people who like classical). This morning was a dreary, rainy day, and Chopin has a Prelude, called 'Raindrop' that just captures the feeling of a rainly day so perfectly. No wonder this music has survived so long.

      It's started to get hot. It wasn't hot today, but yesterday was relatively sweltering. When it starts to get hot, my mind naturally drifts to the movie.... Breaking Away ! (of course you could say the some thing about  Laurence of Arabia )Sometimes it reminds me of summer here. It's not as hot, but the stuck-in-the-most- boring-town-in-the-history-of-the-universe type of feeling sort of gets through to me. The trudging around the center of town on a humid day reminds me much of my summer last year. But that's not the best part of this movie. That's just what makes it appealing at the moment. It's odd, because some of my favorite movies are about sports, and I'm the most unathletic person ever. I also have absolutely no interest in sports whatsoever. But in movies like  Breaking Away  and  Chariots of Fire  it's the characters, ideas and themes that really have me captured.

      1. I'm the best student in my class, a genius no less! 2. I'm the teachers favorite student. 3. Everyone in the class admits that I'm the most talented and beautiful one there. 4. Even though I'm in eighth grade, it's already sure I'll be the valedictorian.  5. All the boys in my class are tripping over each other to ask me out.  AND HERE'S THE CATCH: There are no boys in my class, and no one at all except myself!

      ....'I don't want to read that book because it's too long.' What a low, vulgar, ignorant, disgusting, stupid, horrible, vile, crass, miserable thing to say! Why is it that bad? Becuase... 1.The idea that a book is meant to be short, or meant to require the least amount of thinking possible defeats the purpose of reading. The purpose of reading is to 'know we're not alone' (ever seen  The Shaddowlands ?) or, according to Susan Wise Bower, 'get a glimpse into the human condition.' If these ends are to be appeased it may require over hundreds of pages! So?  2.If a book is truely good than the hundreds of pages will fly by becuase we get involved in people and places we've never known. The author takes us on a journey. In the words of the poet Emily Dickinson, 'There is no frigate like a book to take us lands away, nor any coursers like a page of prancing poetry. This traverse may the poorest take without oppress of toll; how frugal is the chariot that bears a human soul!' 3.A good author does not usually  just  tell a story and develop wonderful characters; they write to express an idea, or cause in a particular way. Doing this is often even more of a struggle than developing characters. We should respect this aspect of the author's work, and not disgrace it just becuase we don't feel like shareing a bit of our time to listen to what this author took so much of his to say to us and the world.

      Willa Cather--author of The Song of the Lark, the book I'm currently reading--has an astonishing ability to develop a character almost instantaneously. It's difficut to describe, but it's as if you know the chrarcter very well after only two paragraphs. I never thought a character could be developed so quickly. Just that fact alone should make anyone interested in writing give some thought to this author who evidently has mastered her craft. Aside from the writing itself this book is so beautiful. I love the characters. The main character, Thea, is wonderful. Not because she's good. Not because she's bad either. But it's her. Her faults are rather similar to my own, which makes me like her, too. I haven't finished it yet, but I'm about three quarters of the way through, and I highly recommend it.

      I've been realizing just how much I enjoy debate. Or, at least, how much I think I enjoy debate. I haven't actually had much experience with it. But for our last Logic assignment we had to do a debate. I debated with my dad, and my sister debated with Catherine, with whom we study Logic, Science and Grammar. My dad and I debated the question, 'Should Abigail have a laptop for high school?' Of course my answer was 'yes'. There was no outright winner, for the assignment was mainly to give us an idea of what debate was like, to give us a chance to use the Logic we'd learned this year, and to critique our arguments. The easiest part was the first three minutes when I stated my arguments for why I should have a laptop for high school. Then came the part that was not so easy, but very fun. After Dad had responded to my arguments and had given some of his own for why I shouldn't have a laptop for high school, I had to respond to his arguments, or rebuild my own in two minutes, with one minute to plan beforehand. This was definately the most interesting part. I think I did much better than my dad expected me to, if you'll forgive me for flattering myself. Most unfortunately I wasn't good enough to convince him to run out to Best Buy and get one right then and there.

I don't know why I chose that word to modify 'recommendation'. But, anyway, what is my recommendation this time?  urlLink World Magazine . World is a Christian magazine which reports and comments on the news from a Christain perspective. The arrival of World is one of the things I most look foward to during the week.

      Whenever I’m with little kids I can’t help but remember how I felt when I was their age. I remember a girl who used to babysit me when we lived in Connecticut. I always viewed her as a “big girl”. It’s odd to think that now I’m the “big girl.” And yet it’s also odd to think that in 4 years I’ll be off to college and all that I’ve written in this blog will be the work of a “kid”. I don’t feel like a “kid” at the moment. Well, that’s my first random thought for the day.

      I just wrote this. It's not actually true, not at the moment. It's true sometimes, usually when I want to write fiction. It's in a slightly different style of poetry than usual, for me. It doesn't have any rhyme scheme or even a hint of meter. Anyway, here it is:    On Writing   by Abigail  I stare at an empty document, Wondering what to write.  No ideas coming. Lazily I start to type, But nothing comes out. Only words. No revolutionary ideas, Just a poem, by a nerd. It barely rhymes. I’ve got writer’s block, I guess. But maybe I’m no writer after all. Maybe this is the end of my writing career, Perhaps I’ve hit some immovable wall. What is writing, anyway? Possibly I never knew. I hope I’ll find out, someday. But what can I do? How can I find out, I mean. What happens when you want to write, But can’t.  I hate staring at an empty screen.

      I was browsing through some different sites including  urlLink The Daily Standard . Here are some articles that I found interesting:   urlLink Reuters' Angry Iraqi --this is about the so-called "neutral" news service   urlLink Harry Potter Grows Up --this one's about the latest Harry Potter movie, which (I just found this out) has Emma Thompson in it. She's my favorite actress, so I'm pretty happy about that.   urlLink False Witness --this is about the movie,  Saved!  which was recently released in theaters. It's pretty interesting; I don't mean I think it sounds like a good movie, in fact it sounds more like quite the reverse, but it's something Christians should take note of. Is this really what people think about us? What, of our own behevior, is responsible for people viewing us this way?

      Like I said, I have blogging fever today. I want to take a moment to heartily recommend the teacher, thinker and writer, R.C. Sproul of  urlLink Ligonier Ministries . He is a wonderful teacher. I have very much enjoyed and profited from his tape/CD lectures. Two lecture series that I have listened to are  urlLink The Consequences of Ideas , which is an overview of philosophy, and  urlLink Recovering the Beauty of the Arts , which is about the arts, as they were meant by God and as thay are viewed today. The teaching is very clear. Methinks I am writing too much (if that’s possible) and the best way to sum it up is to simply say: Get thee to  urlLink Ligonier Ministries !

      Yes, I have more to say. I guess I have blogging fever today. Anyway, my point this time is that if kids were encouraged to interact more with adults they’d behave more like them. Sometimes it seems as if adults avoid teens and teens avoid adults. Really. I don’t know why. Personally, I’ve never classified myself as a teenager. By my age, yes. But by my behavior, I certainly hope not. When I turned 13 I was very strict with my parents about them not calling me a teenager. I always enjoy conversation with adults. Though, I rarely have good conversation with adults outside of my family. The idea of the 21st century teen has affected the way adults view teens. Even the exceptions.  Most unfortunately .

      Just as I posted Part 1 on this topic, I thought up more to say. Compare our expectations of teenagers now to the expectations of teenagers throughout history. It is really only in the latter part of the 20th century that these low expectations developed. Why? I don’t have an answer to that one yet. My general guess would be the increased emphasis on the individual, and less emphasis on the family. I draw my idea of what the teenager was in history from my literary experience. For (and this is a whole other topic to blog about) literature and history cannot be separated. I’ll one of my favorite books as an example.  Sense and Sensibility , by Jane Austen, is really a study of two teenagers. Two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, are the central figures. They are 18 (or 17? Not sure about that one.) and 15 respectively. Both, though they behave very differently, are young women of character, principles, intelligence, and learning. They respect their mother, and show support for her in their time of need as a family. The plot of the book (as in all good books) is driven by their different characters, and combination of flaws and virtues. Their faults, and now that I think of it the faults of many teenagers in classic literature, result mainly from a deficiency in experience. I don’t know if I’m making any sense. But anyway, my point is that the way we view teenagers today is not the same as before. Many great man and women, Jane Austen, James Madison, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Aquinas, and many more showed their potential during their teenage years. From the way teens are expected to behave now it is hard to imagine them having any potential at all.

      I was just thinking about the general expectations of the average teenager. And the more I think about it I realize how low these expectations are. I can’t give any exact examples of what I mean, but the vague impression one seems to get is that once a 12 year old becomes a 13 year old there’s a big change in behavior. Teens are expected be disrespectful, reclusive, reject the authority of parents, prefer the company of their own age, and other related things. One thought that strikes me is that when everyone seems to expect this during the teen years, of course when children get to that age they’ll fulfill those expectations. It’s not a hard thing to fulfill low expectations. I think if people in general had higher expectations of how teenagers should behave, teens would rise to meet those expectations. I find it ironic that all through childhood parents attempt to rear their children to become responsible adults, but when their children become teens, the closest they’ll be to becoming adults, the expectations drop exceedingly and we expect them to behave like children. I’ll probably be writing more on this topic because it is one that I often muse on. Another failure in the 21st century, but, on the positive side, another thing to blog about.

      Look at this:  "Verily, I say unto thee, This day thou shalt be with me in Paradise."  and this:  "Verily I say unto thee this day, Thou shalt be with me in Paradise."  Aren't commas great? I mean, look at the doctrine that hangs on whether the comma goes after 'thee' or after 'day'. Catholics take one, protestants the other.  Eats, Shoots and Leaves , by Lynne Truss, has this interesting example and many more to prove just how important puctuation is. Forget flower power or any other kind of power, comma power is surpassing them all!

      Mr. John Kerry:  Please read your Bible, And in it you will see That you are not acting As a Christian ought to be.  Read the Ten Commandments, And look at number six. “Thou shall not murder.” Abortion you must fix.  God loves little children; They’re precious in his sight. God knows them from the womb. Abortion, surely, is not right.  Now read Romans, chapter one. Same-Sex Marriage is okay? Read verses twenty-six and seven. God doesn’t think your way.  One man. One woman. Ever since Genesis, chapter two. God wants it to stay that way, And that’s what you should seek to do.  When you call yourself a Christian, Please watch what you say. For if you read your Bible, You’ll see it’s not that way.  By Abigail, June 2, 2004

      Sorry I haven't written in a while. I've been rather busy. Anyway, I finished  The Song of the Lark  several days ago, and right now I'm reading  Eats, Shoots, and Leaves  by Lynne Truss. It's the #1 British Bestseller at the moment. But here's the interesting thing: it's about puctuation! It's astonishing that a book that one would think would be only for students, has become a bestseller. I'm now about halfway through it, and I find that it's not so astonishiong after all. Filled with wit and humor, it pleads the case of the commas and apostrophes, which, she writes, are so commonly misused.  urlLink Eats, Shoots and Leaves  is worth a read. I'll write a full review once I've finished it.

There was a piece at the beginning to the tune of  Jerusalem , I didn't think it had the same words, but I could be mistaken. And at the end, when the casket was being taken out, there was a piece that was absolutely haunting. I'm not sure what it was, but it was very appropriate.

My father was in the Navy at that time, and he has many positive things to say about Reagan. I thought that what Margaret Thatcher said was the best of what everyone had to say. President Bush, too, was very good, but not as good as Margaret Thatcher. I think we need someone like Reagan now, but that's stating the obvious. Neither Bush or Kerry has what he had.

      We've been studying the human body in Science, toward the end of this year. It's so intricate, but somehow it seems so disconnected with life. It's hard to explain, but the different processes that keep us alive seem so far apart from the things we think and do. Maybe it's just me. It's as if all the cells, signals, nerves, and organs that do their functions are apart from me rather than in me. It's as if there are two parts to a human: their physical self, and their mental and emotional self. Does anyone else feel this?

      Here is a poem I wrote a while ago. It's an poor attempt at satire. It's subject matter is more than a little controversial, so if you comment on it, please comment on the poem itself.     The Caveman   By Abigail  “Umfa, umfa, glug, glug,” The caveman walks with heavy trudge.  His hair is tangled, long and black, It also trails right down his back.  He’s stooped and bent and walks along, There is no path to follow long.  He stops, and raises shaggy head, He’s dumb, he just awoke from bed.  He spies a rabbit, tense and shy, He shoots his arrow through its eye.  He grabs his prey with haughty look, He has no fire, it cannot cook.  He’s starved; he eats the bunny raw, And drinks its blood without a straw.  His blood-stained mouth grins stupidly, He is akin to you and me!  He does not talk, just gurgles noise, And on he goes with little poise.  Again he stops at different sight, He sees a girl, whose face shows fright.  “Me the man, you woman mine,” Reluctant, she begins to whine.  He snatches her up by the hair, He means to take her to his lair.  She kicks and screams, and brings a fight, He knocks her out, now all is right.  This man, this mighty caveman, tall, He fathered us, he fathered all!!!

      I was flipping through a book called  The Great Pianists from Mozart to the Present , by Harold C. Schonberg (1963). I was reading about Chopin's hands. That may sound odd, but to one who plays the piano it can be an interesting subject. Let me quote:  'What an artist he must have been! Heller spoke of Chopin's slim hands--how they would "suddenly expand and cover a third of the keyboard. It was like the opening of the mouth of a serpent about to swallow a rabbit whole"...'  I love that quote of Heller's. That was a great comparison with the serpent. I was reading about that period of time: the Romantic period in the history of music. It always makes me so envious! All those wonderful composers living at the same time, creating music that will never die, and always be delightful. Chopin is, of course, my favorite. I'm working on his Waltz in A Minor (Posthumous), and Prelude in E Minor (Op.28, No.4). Playing them is so wonderful, but whenever I read about their composer I feel how inadeuqately I express their genius. Once I sat for over an hour doing absolutely nothing but listen to a Chopin CD, and the time went by very quickly. I think I've got to the point in this post where I'm rambling, and if you want to understand me now you'll just have to listen to Chopin's music yourself.

      The phrase 'be yourself' is a very popular one. But I find it ironic that those who want to be themselves often resort to things that make them even more like others. That may be confusing, but here's what I mean: Those who want to stand out, or be different often resort to many piercings, tattoos, dyeing and styling their hair in odd ways, and other unnatural things like that. However, my point is that those things only make them stand out  less . For I can walk through the mall and see three people with green hair, or multiple piercings and it only detracts from what is  really original : their natural selves. When you dye your hair green it takes away your own unique color, and it puts you in a class of all the others who have green hair. When you cover yourself with tattoos it detracts attention from your God-given natural looks to something made by man. So in the end those who claim that they are 'being themselves' are really only hiding what is theirs alone. Am I making any sense?

      You know, it's an awful thing to be disappointed in your country. To think of what it once was, and compare it to what it is now, and feel like you wish you were never born into such an age as this. To feel like there's no point in living unless you do something to change it. And when all around you seems so resistant, then you feel so small. It's even worse when you're 14 years old. Man, I can't wait to be older! To make people listen. To listen to others. When you're 14 everyone thinks you're just a teenager and never bothers to make conversation with you. Everyone except my parents, family, and a few others think I'm quiet! Ha! How little they know. They never bother to think you might be different, to think you have a mind of your own. Oh, well. Oh I can't wait to get out!

      I just found out (thanks to World Mag.) that a classic is a book that is still relevent and read after 50 years. I personally say it should be a 100 years, but whatever. Anyway, I guess that means if I write a novel in the next 10 years, and live to be 80, I'll find out whether or not I'm a classic author! Better get writing!

      I want a summer job. There's a rather large problem, though. I'm extremely picky. I want something that uses one's brain, and is interesting. It would be even better if it could somehow have writing involved. Any ideas?

      I'm not a math person. My brain just doesn't function that way. I'm better with words than with numbers. For example:  Math problems are hurting my brain, I try but it gives me a pain. The cause of my wrath And torment is math. It’s driving me very insane! (By Me)  Anyway, sometimes my math book will have me do a bunch of graphs or equations, and at the end they'll unwisely ask, "What do you notice about the above graphs/equations?". So, I'll look them over and find the only thing in common is that I wrote my 4's slanted, or the lines on my graphs are not very graceful. Since they asked my what  I  noticed about the graphs/equations, I'll tell them what  I  noticed. Or sometimes I'll simply write "It is against my religious principles to answer this question." or "I have the right to remain silent." Then I ask Dad about the problem. See what my poor parents have to suffer?

      Last night my dad and I rented  The Longest Day , in memory of D-Day. This movie is fantastic. It was just absolutely unbelievable. The bravery of these men is something I just can't comprehend. One neat thing was that at different points in the movie men from both sides of the war said, "Sometimes I wonder which side God is on." I've never studied World War II in history yet. We had American history in my old school last year but my teacher was really bad and we barely got to the Civil War. I might write more on this later because it's so amazing, and I don't quite have my thoughts together at the moment.

      If Chopin were alive, I'd marry him. It'd be like marrying music itself. If Beethoven were alive I'd marry him, too. And Bach. Maybe not Mozart, though he was certainly a very attractive man.

      I'm getting sick of the word hearty. The last time I wrote a 'Hearty Recommendation' post, I said the word reminded me of a plump, red-faced gentleman with a lopsided top hat. Now I say it reminds me of the same man, but this time he had a little too much to drink and he's slowly walking down a street swinging a bottle and singing loudly. Anyway, what am I writing this for? Oh, yeah. My recommendation. This time I heartily recommend...(drum roll, please)... Invitation to the Classics , edited by Louise Cowan and Os Guinness.  urlLink This book  is wonderful. It is a Christian book that introduces the masterpieces of Western Literature. My dad is planning to, some time or other, put together a book table at our church. This would be on it. It should be on your bookshelf, too.

      Both Charlotte Bronte and Jane Austen were pastors' daughters. Isn't that teriffic? Of course, I find that particularly interesting becuase I, too, am a pastor's daughter. Anyway, they are two facinating young ladies. They both died young as well, and they were both authors. That is, pretty much, as far as their similarities go. At least according to my study of them. Charlotte lived a rather reclusive life. Jane was very social, especially in her teens; in fact, she was quite a flirt. Jane loved wit, irony, and humor, and she especially loved communicating something through those means. I don't know as much about Charlotte as I do about Jane, but, from what I understand, she was a quiet, thoughtful person. I don't know whether either of them were Christians, but both show in their novels a respect for God, the church, and Christianity. Some say Jane Austen didn't like clergymen because of the way they are often portrayed in her novels: proud, presuming and affectedly pious men. But the truth is that she  did  hold the office of the clergy in high regard, and it is mainly becuse of this that she protrayed them this way; for in those days clergymen often were such because their fathers were pastors, or they inherited the job from someone. Jane felt that this position was one of calling, not inheriting. So, very often in her novels, pastors are partrayed as unfit for their postiton because, at that time, they often were. Charlotte's novel,  Jane Eyre , is a beautiful story of moral courage, and redemption. The last word of the book is 'Jesus'. When I read it I notice some phrases used from the Bible, for example, "pondered these things in my heart"-the same was said of Mary.  Anyway, these are just some musings on these two ladies, whom I admire and respect.

      Does God have a sense of humor? That's one think that bothers me about the Bible. I know its purpose is not to make us laugh (though non-Christians certainly do laugh at it, but it's a laugh of mockery, not delight). The only solace I find for this question is P.G.Wodehouse. This chap is worth reading. He's one of the funniest authors ever to pick up a pen. Really. He's also British, which, to me, is an unquestionable virtue. He's a classicaly educated man with a great knowledge of the Bible. I don't know whether he was a Christian or not. But in his books he uses Biblical imagery in such a way as to make it humorous without a hint of mockery. He also uses classical and historical imagery, (I'm not sure if imagery is quite the right word, but whatever). For example:        "Indeed, just before Jeeves came in, I had been dreaming that some         bounder was driving spikes through my head--not just ordinary        spikes, as used by Jael the wife of Heber, but red-hot ones."  That's from  The Code of the Woosters , Bertie Wooster on getting up in the morning after a late night out. There's also a scene from BBC's  Jeeves and Wooster , a TV series based on P.G.Wodehouse's stories of those two characters, where Bertie Wooster, forced from his own bed by an unexpected guest retires to a shed outside. The guest asks if there is not a couch that he can sleep on, and he replies, "There is. It's Noah's. He brought it ashore from Mt.Ararat."

      It is a lazy Sunday. It is a rainy Sunday. I'm sick of rain. I'm sick of caterpillars, which, by the way, are  everywhere ! I can't even walk over to church without stepping on a few. Gross. My mom and sister are at my cousin's graduation, so it's just me and my dad, which is fun. He's sleeping right now. His usual Sunday afternoon nap. After a first-class sermon such as today's (and ever other Sunday's) who can blame him? My dad is the best pastor to walk the earth.

      As one of my presents for my dad I’m letting him listen to the Red Sox game without interruption. He’s a big fan. Here’s a conversation I just had with him (when he wasn’t paying attention to the game): Me: “Why do you like the Red Sox?” Dad: “Why do you like Chopin?” Me: “Because he’s beautiful.” Dad: “The Red Sox are beautiful.” The only time I ever consider sports beautiful is when I watch  Chariots of Fire  (which is a  great  movie, by the way),  and  when Dad is in a really good mood because the Red Sox win.

      Yesterday I finished  Lord of the Flies , by William Golding. This is a phenomenal book. It is the story of some schoolboys who are wrecked on an uninhabited island. It is the tale of how they start an organized tribe, but how they quickly succumb to savagery and anarchy. It’s a book about original sin. It shows that, however young we are, when the security of all we have known in the civilized world, the supervision of those in authority, and the rules that govern our old life are taken away, our nature is one of darkness and violence, of sin and corruption. The boys start out by electing a chief, Ralph, and setting up some basic rules. The start a signal fire so that a ship passing by might know of their presence and rescue them. Soon all of the boys except Ralph and another boy called Piggy and a few others, forget the importance of the fire and start doing what they will. Slowly all that was organized and all the rules are forgotten by most of the boys. There is a boy called Jack who is very violent and wants to be the leader and do nothing but hunt the animals on the island. Eventually almost all of the boys side with him and forget the fire. The fire dies out because there are not enough boys to keep it up who are willing to do so. The breaking up of the rules hurts the boys, even though most don’t recognize this, because it lessens their chance of rescue. Here is an interesting part:  “The rules!” shouted Ralph. “You’re breaking the rules!” “Who cares?” Ralph summoned his wits. “Because the rules are the only thing we’ve got!” But Jack was shouting against him.  I think this is something that is very relevant to our society today. Today, our culture wants to have as few rules as possible. The attitude is ‘do whatever you want so long as it doesn’t hurt anyone else’. But one thing we don’t see is how much doing what we want does hurt us. It may hurt us and others around us where we can’t see it. But just because we can’t see where it hurts us, doesn’t mean it isn’t there. This is because our nature is one that is dark and evil. It is so bad, and so ingrained into ourselves that we don’t see how awful it is. We are never free of our nature. So left to ourselves how can we do anything that doesn’t hurt us and others around us? In that way, the rules set by God and by civilization give us freedom. We then have the freedom to choose right or wrong. These boys, when they no longer had grown ups to enforce these rules, clung to their natures, and became violent, and murderous. They killed each other. I remember, after reading the first chapter or two, thinking  how could they become that bad, after all, they’re just kids ? But they did become that bad. But the fact is that they didn’t  become  that bad, they  were  already that bad, only the rules gave them the freedom to choose what was right. In many good books it’s the characters that drive the plot. It’s not like that in this book. Though the main characters are well developed, it’s the idea behind the story that drives this book. Novels are one of many wonderful ways to communicate an idea. They have the ability to do it so subtly, but so persuasively, too. Golding did a wonderful thing when he wrote this book. It’s violent, it’s gory, it’s hard, but it’s  good . It’s good because it communicates truth. All that is violent and gory in this book is for the purpose of relating something that is true about our selves. And even the fact that man can communicate something in this way shows that he is made in the image of God. That which is good in man, is the part of man that is God’s image. The creativity of man is of God. The sinfulness of our nature is not of God, it is our own doing, but there is the wonderful hope that God has provided for a way for salvation from that nature. (Isn’t it great how much there is to think about in a good book? I think churches should have Literary Discussion Groups!) By the way, the title of this post, Weeping for the Darkness of Man’s Heart, comes from a line in the book. At the end, the boys are rescued. And Ralph, who is the last of the boys who remain faithful to the rules, “wept for the end of innocence, for the darkness of man’s heart…”

      Today was the first day in a while that actually felt like summer. Blue skies and heat. It was also my last piano lesson before summer break. I was assigned a couple new songs to work on.  Sonata in C Major  by Scarlatti and  Sonatina in A Minor  by Kabalevsky. I like both of them very much. The first reminds me of an impeccably trimmed garden. The second of I don’t know what.

      It is so dreary today. It’s very windy and there is no blue in the sky at all, only gray and white. It reminds me of  Jane Eyre . I can see Jane walking out on the moor, on a day just like this. I think it’s the day she first meets Mr. Rochester. I love that book. Have I ever told you my theory about  Jane Eyre ? It’s not really a theory, it’s an observation. The plot of  Jane Eyre  slightly resembles the book of Ruth in the Bible. I love it. Ruth is my favorite woman in the Bible. Then Esther. It may be odd, but my least favorite is Abigail. I don’t like her because she married David. I wouldn’t have married David if I were her. Why, he had so many of wives! He couldn’t have loved her, and she couldn’t have loved him: she barely knew him.

      Just in case you ever wonder how I got to be the way I am the answer is quite simple: my parents. It may be odd for a 14 year old to be crazy about people like Chopin, Jane Austen, Bach, George Eliot, Mozart, Charles Dickens, Beethoven, and many more. When all the other girls my age are putting posters of Orlando Bloom on their walls I put up quotes from the latest book I’m reading. Well, it’s not all my doing, but I wouldn’t want it to be any other way. For example, one of my first memories is of Dad reading the Chronicles of Narnia aloud to my sister and me, and of listening to The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings read on tape. As far as music is concerned, I don’t ever remember listening to anything but classical. My parents discouraged me from listening to or buying rock CDs. Later they let me buy Christian rock, but by that time I had lost interest in it. I remember being especially discouraged from listening to the Backstreet Boys. Once I went over to a friend’s house and she said, “Hey, let’s listen to my new Backstreet Boys CD,” and I said no! I didn’t even listen to it at my friend’s house. Some might have resented this, and I probably did, for a little while, but my parents always gave me the alternative of classical music, and others.  I’m really glad that my parents did this. And I don’t just like Classical. I love jazz, and Celtic. I really enjoy musicals, too.  Fiddler on the Roof ,  West Side Story , and  My Fair Lady  are my favorites. That kind of music makes life so rich! Anyway, that’s just in case you ever wondered what kind of planet I’m coming from…

      Yesterday at church we observed Christian Education Sunday. This is a service dedicated to showing what the children have learned in Sunday School. At the end, Bibles are presented to certain age groups, a Study Bible for those graduating from high school, a Teen Bible for those going into high school, etc. This year I got the NIV Teen Study Bible published by Zondervan because next year I will be in high school. I already have an English Standard Version (ESV) that I use and will continue to use, but I was flipping through this one afterwards. I can’t believe how much the Bible itself suffers from people trying to impose a modern American teen perspective on it. It’s a Study Bible, so it has notes and different things added to it in order to ‘help’ the reader. At the beginning there is a ‘teen version’ of 1 Corinthians 13:4-7. One of the definitions of love is this ‘Love doesn’t hate the girl who goes out with the guy you like.’ It seems as if this Bible is giving its thumbs-up for teens to ‘go out’. It’s advocating the most childish behavior by accepting it as normal. Yes, you might say it’s good that they’re telling kids to ‘hate the girl who goes out with the guy you like’, but if they just said ‘It’s dumb for you to date’, we wouldn’t have the problem in the first place! My parents don’t allow me to ‘go out’, which is fine by me. Even if they let me, I wouldn’t want to. The whole ‘dating’ system of junior high and high school is ridiculous. But enough with that example. Throughout the Teen Bible there are extra pages on things such as school, guilt, parents, dating, death, and others. They feature a dictionary definition of the word and an alternate ‘teen’ definition. Then they give a little bite of Scripture for each one. Here are some of the ‘teen’ definitions:  School —‘a place where teens have to learn stuff adults never use but say teens will need someday’   Prayer —‘talking to the ceiling and wondering if anybody’s listening’   Church —‘what you have to get dressed up for so you can be bored for an hour at a morning service’   Parents —‘adults whose actions often drive teenagers crazy’   Siblings —‘a monster, younger or older than you are, who lives in your house but couldn’t possibly be related to you or any other human being’. Yup, that’s what it means to be a teen. But you would think the church of all institutions would try to fight against that mindset! They’d least of all except it as normal! I can think of Bible verses that automatically make all of those ‘teen’ definitions wrong. ‘Honor your father and your mother’ comes to mind immediately. ‘Love thy neighbor as thyself’ doesn’t quite compute with their definition of siblings. Look at the definition of church! Those who put this Bible together don’t seem to get the fact that they’re demeaning the Bible and Christianity by doing this. I’d rather have all teens thinking of church as boring than having those who are devoted to it slighted by this demeaning of it. It’s mortifying how low the dignity of the Bible has to sink to be considered ‘cool’. Perhaps I’m over-reacting, but if I am it’s not just to this. It’s to the whole idea of what teenagers are supposed to be like! I, by my age, am bound to this idea of a teen. People see me and they see a teenager. No matter how different I may be, until I am 20, I am a teen, and must bear all of the assumptions that come with it. I love my parents. And the last thing their actions do are drive me crazy. They’ve made a lot of sacrifices for me and I know it. I trust them and know that what they do is for my best. Even if I get annoyed sometimes, I know that I’ll be grateful later. They’re my best friends. I talk to them a ton. They listen. They know me better than anyone, and I hate the idea that people think that I have the same definition of ‘parents’ as the one above. Just because I’m 14! Also that definition of school, too, is annoying! If it was really true that we learned stuff we didn’t need in school, than why would we be there? I love to learn. I love to read, especially. Many of the closest friends I have are in books. Why? Because adults view me as a ‘teen’ so they don’t talk to me, and most others my age talk about clothes, guys, dating, the mall, etc., in which I have absolutely no interest. Of course there are a few exceptions. I wouldn’t have any friends at all, otherwise. Can you tell I’m rather passionate about this subject? I’ve written about it before. (See Teenagers in the 21st Century, Parts 1, 2, and 3—that’s from several weeks ago) It’s something I think about a great deal. Maybe I’ll make this post into an essay.

      At the library the other day, I saw a short biography of Condoleezza Rice. It’s one of those young adult biographies. I checked it out, because I had heard some neat things about her. She is really remarkable. The thing I liked the best, I suppose, is that she was a minister’s daughter. Obviously I like that because I can really relate to it, being a pastor’s kid myself. I also like the fact that she has many interests and is talented at many things. I didn’t know she played the piano so well. She even preformed once with Yo-Yo Ma! Her name comes from the Italian musical phrase  con dolcezza , which means “to perform with sweetness”. I wish I had an interesting name like that! Anyway, she seems like a very interesting lady.

      I was musing on the phrase “when you grow up”. Most frequently used in the question, “What do you want to be when you grow up?”. Anyway it occurred to me that people don’t really mean “when you grow up” but “when you are older”. I think that growing up is really maturing, and people do that at varying rates. But when someone asks me what I want to be be when I grow up, they really mean what do I intend to do for a living. And one must have a living whether one is truly grown up or not. We all age at the same rate. Meaning I am now several seconds older than when I began this sentence. And you will be several second older than when you began to read it. But though I am now older, that does not mean I am any wiser. My main point for this random post is that there is a big difference between growing up and growing older. I hope this year I’ve grown up, for I’ve undoubtedly grown older.

      What's up? Wazup? Wassup? Wuts ^? All these mean the same, at least on instant messenger. And they're all pretty straight forward. But the other day I was was conversing with someone who asked me "Sup?" to start conversation. Sup??? I always think of "sup" as a verb for supper, for example, "Let us to the table to sup." I mean, no one uses it that way, but that's what I intially think of. "Wsup?" would be slightly more appropriate; you at least get the "w" in there. If I have the nerve, maybe next time I'll reply, "No, I haven't had dinner yet, have you?"

      I was listening to Mozart's  Requiem  this morning while getting ready to go to church. It's not really the best music to get you "up and at 'em", but why would I want to go "up and at anyone" anyway? It is so beautiful, so haunting. I think this is one of my favorites of all of Mozart's works. It really captures death in music. I have found that most of my favorite Mozart is vocal. I love his operas. But this could be due to the fact that most of the Mozart I listen to  is  vocal. In other words, I don't have any Mozart CD's that are just keyboard music. The only Mozart keyboard music I have is from "Great Piano Classics" CDs and things like that. Could anyone recommmend any Mozart CDs that focus mainly on his keyboard music?

      I sometimes hear (and read) Christians criticize the Renaissance as a humanistic time, and a time with much secularism. There surely  were  some secular ideas and things that started in the Renaissance, but I think we sometimes carry it too far. I think it could be argued that without the Renaissance the Reformation would never have occurred, or, at least, it would not have had the impact or following that it did. First of all, the development of the printing press greatly helped to spread the written word to all classes of life, rather than just the wealthy. More people had access to the gospel, and they could read God’s Word for themselves, rather than always relying on the church to tell and interpret it for them. And as the history of Christianity progressed, so did its temporal power. And at the dawn of the Reformation many of the clergy paid more attention do the demands of their purse than the demands of God’s law. Another effect of the development of the printing press was that the Greek and Roman classics were being discovered again, and people desired to read them in their original language. That idea was also carried into the church, and many scholars started to read the Bible in Greek and Hebrew, and saw the difference from what the church, at the time, was teaching and practicing, and what God’s word actually said. The Renaissance also brought a general thirst for learning and the printing press made it more widely available. Again, this thirst was carried into the Church, and without it, perhaps the Reformation would have had less of a following. I will also note that though some secular ideas  did  start to develop in the Renaissance, it certainly is not in anyway to the extent of the way secular ideas dominate today’s culture. There was still a strong sense of morality, and even Cosimo de’ Medici, a very learned, wealthy, and influential citizen of Florence, said, after donating an extremely large sum of money to a monastery, “Never shall I be able to give God enough to set him down in my books as a debtor.” This man asked only in return for what he had given, that the monks let him have the use of a cell for reflection. Not to mention Lorenzo Valla, who wrote,  On Free Will , which is about God’s sovereignty and our free will, and who was one of two men whom Luther said most influenced his ideas. Of course, it is only God who knows men’s hearts, but I think that there were many godly things and people in the Renaissance, and I feel privileged to study it from a Christian perspective.

      As I said, we’re studying the Renaissance. Of course much of that includes looking at the developments in the art of that time. I’ve realized that many of the paintings I’m most fascinated by are of people as opposed to a landscape or still life. For me, in painting, people and their expressions and faces are of the most interest. I wonder why. This is just some random musing.

      Does a writer have to experience much of what he writes about to write about it well? Can a person who is not an adult write about adults convincingly? Does one have to have experience in the world to write about it?

      I’ve been musing lately on whether television, as a whole, is good or bad. It’s rather a complicated topic, and I think, in a way, both answers are correct. Television has the capability to deliver news of current events almost instantaneously, and to increase our knowledge with things like The History Channel, and PBS. I don’t think it is always true that a picture is worth a thousand words, but in some cases it certainly is and television can do that job. Good movies can prompt discussion, makes us laugh, and capture and idea, thought, or character in image and sound. A good movie can be a work of art. That’s the good part of the television. But our own corruption can turn what could be good into a source of downfall. We fill movies today with the baseness of our nature. With violence and immodesty. We, in our laziness, spend so much time at the television, that we forget how to think for ourselves. Our attention span lessens exceedingly. The importance and impact of the written word fades into the distance. In that respect, television is a crime. This certainly is an interesting topic. I believe there’s a book written about a slightly similar topic, called  Amusing Ourselves to Death , by Neil Postman. Perhaps I’ll put it on my ever increasingly longer ‘To Read’ list.

      After finishing studying the Middle Ages in history, we have finally begun the Renaissance. We’re going to continue history throughout the summer, which I don’t mind at all. I thought the Middle Ages were pretty interesting, but they are dull in comparison with the Renaissance! It’s partly because of how much I’m enjoying our study of this period in history that I’ve been so inactive on my blog. I’ll write more on this later.

      I don’t know if it’s really carried through on this blog how much of a Jane Austen fan I am. I’m sure from reading my posts you would realize my great passion for good books, primarily those that have proven their worth over time. But, I believe I really have not communicated my great love of Jane Austen’s novels. Certainly the authors that that period of time produced seems to contain my favorites: Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, George Eliot, Charles Dickens, etc. (Though I do love many other authors, many happen to be from this time period.) I have read all of Jane Austen’s complete novels, (excepting Lady Susan). One of my aunts introduced me to Jane Austen by lending our family the six hour adaptation of  Pride and Prejudice , which, I believe, I watched from beginning to end without a break and proceeded to read the book, and then all of the other books. I am forever deeply indebted to my wonderful aunt. Anyway, I was thinking that though I often write about what I’m currently reading on this blog; I really haven’t said much about what I have already read, and re-read with great pleasure. So I am planning to write about all my favorite books, starting with Jane Austen’s, and share my thoughts on them. It’s in times like these that I earnestly long for a literary discussion group, when I am forced into, perhaps, very dull monologues about these books to get my thoughts out, rather than lively discussion with others. As far as Jane Austen is concerned, though,  urlLink Pemberley  is my only consolation.

      I was thinking more on the emotions music can evoke in a listener (or musician/participator) and comparing it to the emotions, or thoughts, evoked by good literature. And then comparing that to what we feel when we see a beautiful painting, or see a play, or watch a movie. In short, I was thinking about the arts, and how they touch us, in their different ways. Here’s what I came up with:   Literature : I think literature (especially fiction), when in the hands of a good writer, can make people feel emotion, but it also has a direct reason for the emotion it evokes. It can make readers think more deeply about an issue or idea, it can shed light on truth in a subtle way, and it can bring into the readers’ lives wonderful characters that become so well known that they seem to be real people who have lived.    Music : It’s really hard to describe exactly how music can affect us, and I think it’s probably a little different for everyone. But music has the power to change a mood in an instant. It evokes powerful emotions (I don’t know if that’s quite the right word) but, unlike literature, it does not have a clear source. For example, if we pity a character in literature we know why we pity them, but in music we may feel sadness, or pity, but it’s something indefinable in the music itself that makes us feel this way. I can be listening to Ralph Vaughan Williams’ Fantasia on Greensleeves, and feel very depressed, or sort of sadly reflective (not in a bad way, though) and then listen to a Chopin Polonaise and feel very alive and energetic.    Drama/Cinematography : I think it’s often forgotten that movies are an art, and perhaps if this was more realized, Hollywood might see that the objectionable content it so often adds does nothing to enhance it. Drama and theatre are no so much a part of our culture now as they used to be. So I’ll focus mainly on film. Movies combine the many aspects of the arts together, and depending on how well they are done they can provoke thought and reflection. I don’t think, though, that they can do it to such an extent as literature or music. And I certainly do not think they will ever replace the written word.    Art : This for me is the hardest one to describe. I don’t think art (as in painting, sculpture, architecture, etc.) really evokes emotion. This could just be me, though. It evokes reflection, thought, and awe. But again, this reflection and thought are not the same kind of reflection and thought brought forth by literature. Art is more vague than literature, and less precise, though not less precise in a bad way. I don’t think I did very well by this one, but, oh well!

      One thing I’m involved in this summer is a chorus directed by my voice teacher and her friend (who is also another voice teacher). We had our first rehearsal last night. It’s hard to use words to describe the great pleasure I get from, together with others, producing something beautiful. The last time I really sang in a chorus was in 3rd grade, so this is really exciting for me. I just love the wonderful sensation music can give. Good music, truly good music, music which reflects the image of God in man, seems to have an elevating power. And whenever I sing, or play the piano, I always feel pity for those who can’t play an instrument, or feel shy about singing, for music is just such a beautiful, wonderful gift from God. Of course not everyone is musical, for God has gifted people in different ways. If He hadn’t life wouldn’t be so interesting.

      There has been a great amount of discussion due to the proposal of some of the Southern Baptists to remove their children from the public schools. At this point I will not argue my entire side of the issue, mainly because I don’t have time, but I just want to briefly reflect on one point. One reason people give to keep their children in the public schools is so that they can be a light to the world. They consider putting their children in a Christian school or home-schooling them, as hiding them under a bushel. Or they say it would be ignoring the Great Commission to put them there, unable to interact with and shine among non-Christians. This is not true because:  1. The whole point of school is to get an education; it is a time of learning and development on the child’s part. The main point of going to school is not to evangelize. Also, putting children in a Christian school, or home-schooling them, does not mean that they have no opportunities to interact with non-Christians.  2. Putting a child in the public school from Kindergarten through high school means they will be spending much of the day in the secular world, more than they spend in Church, Sunday School, youth group, prayer and devotions put together. Without the time spent in a Christian environment how are they to evangelize well, anyway?  3. Putting Christian children in public schools brings in a lot of competition for the parents. They have to compete with their children’s exposure to all the enticing temptations of the secular world. Even if Christian children avoid the temptations, they will certainly not try to evangelize and mark themselves out, risking seclusion. Peer pressure like that from Kindergarten is not healthy for a young Christian’s growth, and if a Christian child is weak, how can we expect strong evangelism?  4. From a scientific perspective, it is unwise to put Christians in the public schools because it will only make them weaker in one part of evangelism: the public schools teach the theory of evolution as a fact rather than a theory. Even if they refer to it as a theory they offer no alternatives. Christians, then, will have no knowledge of the Creationist theory, and will not know all of the scientific evidence against evolution and for Creationism. This will leave them very weak, and ignorant. And if they try to evangelize later on, this could be a very weak point.  5. The triumphs and down falls in Christian History are not taught in the public schools, nor are they taught in Sunday Schools. (The Sunday Schools have a hard enough time combating with what the kids are bombarded with in the public schools to even think about teaching Christian History.) Where are Christian children ever to learn about their heritage? The children of the secular world will have more training in their beliefs than the children of God. And then God’s children will have their impressions of History, Science, Literature, Art, Music and Math molded by those of the secular world. (God isn’t the Lord of all His creation for nothing. God is present in all areas of learning, and we should teach our children accordingly.) The children of God will surely suffer for it.   Well, that wasn’t very brief, but I think that it shows why I believe that, on the whole, putting our Christian children in the public schools will only weaken their light, and will only weaken them in their fulfillment of the Great Commission, rather than the opposite. I will also add that the responsibility to give children an education falls solely on the parents of the children. Therefore if the parents chose to educate their children through the public schools, any mistakes made by the teachers in the public schools fall on the heads of the parents of the children, for they are ultimately responsible.

      If you’re a Christian and enjoy writing fiction, World Magazine’s having a  urlLink writing contest  that you might consider entering. I’d enter it, but you have to be eighteen or older. Alas!

      About a year or so ago, World Magazine came out with a Top 50 Movies issue, and our family has often referred to it for good movie recommendations. I had never heard of  The Winslow Boy  before, but the short description offered in World sounded interesting so we rented it. I now own the DVD, if that’s any evidence of its worth. It’s about a family in the early 20th century, living in London. The Winslows’ youngest son, Ronnie, is expelled from school and accused of theft. The movie follows the whole family as they struggle together to prove his innocence. A respected lawyer, Sir Robert Morton, represents Ronnie in court, and the case soon becomes a nation-wide spectacle. The family makes many sacrifices and tries to hold together. It’s a relatively simple story, but the movie is spectacular just because of the simplicity, and yet, in a subtle way, it’s also very complex. I wouldn’t say it’s a family film, because that often implies that younger children would enjoy it, and this movie, though it’s rated only G, is not really for younger children; I don’t think they would understand it. But it’s a movie about a family, about what families are really like. It has some great lines, and wonderful acting, with Jeremy Northam, Gemma Jones, Rebecca Pidgeon, and Nigel Hawthorne.

      I always have a lengthy reading list for the summer, which I never finish. But I also like to do some re-reading of my favorite books in the summer, too. I’ve found that listening to books read on tape is a great way to go for things I’ve already read myself, but want to experience again. So I’m usually listening to a book I’ve already read on tape and  reading one I haven’t before. And listening is great because you can do other things while you listen. Anyway what I’m leading up to is this: a couple of days ago I finished listening to  Mansfield Park , by Jane Austen, read on tape. Of course, being the Jane Austen fan that I am, I have already read the book myself.  Mansfield Park  is one of Jane Austen’s books that many of her fans strongly disagree over. The main character, Fanny Price, is one that is certainly more difficult to relate to than some of Jane Austen’s other main characters. Fanny is very quiet, keeps all her cares and worries totally out of the view of others, has very high principles, and receives all the unjust behavior directed toward her without defending herself or fighting back. The plot is this: Fanny comes to live with her wealthy Uncle and Aunt Bertram when she is about ten years old, because her own mother has too many children to take care of and the Bertrams offer to bring her up with their children. (This was not an uncommon thing at that time.) She comes from, as far as social position is concerned, a lesser family, and the distinction remains unjustly with her, though she grows up with her cousins: Tom, Edmund, Maria, and Julia. Edmund is her only friend, and despite the differences between Fanny and the rest of her cousins, she grows up with more merit, and a better sense of principle than her female cousins. The book is mainly about how, through numerous circumstances, Fanny’s merit and worth is finally realized by everyone at last. It is one of Jane Austen’s longest books and contains the great characterization and elegant writing which flows through all her novels.  Mansfield Park  is delightful mainly for the characters themselves, but also for the reward to Fanny’s patience, steadfastness, and endurance.

      It’s funny that during the school year I always thought that I’d do a lot more blogging in the summer, but I guess that’s not the case, maybe because of the irregularity of this time.

       I’m going to be away the next few days, almost a week. So I won’t be blogging at all. Not that you will notice anyway. I haven’t been very regular on that score lately. Anyway, I do have things I’m planning to write about in the relatively near future, so you have my review of Chaim Potok’s  The Chosen  to look forward to, and also my thoughts on E.M. Forster’s  Howards End  (which I haven’t finished yet, but, all the same, I’m almost done with it). And finally I leave you anticipate my thoughts on God’s love and His judgment of sin and how the two fit together. I also leave you with a question: When I finish  Howards End , should I read Anne Bronte’s The Tennant of Wildfell Hall, or Henry James’s  The Portrait of a Lady?  (And if you answer, please do not say, ‘Well James’s  Portrait  is a good book, but I wouldn’t recommend it at your age. The reading level is quite harder than Bronte’s  Tennant .’ I’ll make the boldest statement here and declare that I can read absolutely anything, however hard it may seem, in the English language. And I should enjoy a challenge on that point.)&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Today my friend and I protested gay marriage. I live on a relatively busy street. We made two signs. One said, “Honk if you’re for traditional marriage” and the other, “Marriage equals one man and one woman”, and held them up to the cars that drove by. We got 146 honks in and hour and a half. Of course, that was out of about 500 cars going by.      At one point, my friend said, “This is depressing.”     I simply replied, “This is Massachusetts.”      Toward the end a lady shouted, “F*** you!” and pulled over. “Why are you doing this? Why are you against gay marriage?”    “Because it’s wrong,” I said.    “Says who? Your parents?”    “God,” I answered.    “Yeah, right. God accepts everyone,” Said the lady.     “God hates sin.”    “Wait until you’re older, honey. Then you’ll understand,” and with another swear she drove off. That was more or less how our conversation went.    Great impression of the view she represents!

      I said before I got the DVD of  The Return of the King . I was watching some of the interviews on the extra features. I was laughing so hard because, although, over all, I think the adaptation was pretty good, the thoughts of the cast, director, and others on the content of the book and movie was really a lot of stating the obvious. They were talking about things that anyone could pick up. For people who had been working with that material for so long you would think they would have gleaned a little more from it. They kept saying these very obvious things in a deep and serious manner, so that they didn’t look so obvious. I found it highly diverting. On a slightly more serious note they all seemed to agree that the movies would survive as long as film did! I think that’s quite a statement to make and is often applied to more than it should be. The book has survived, and from all we know of it, it will continue to survive, but that doesn’t mean that the films will.

      I was thinking about how, to some extent, our conscience is mainly developed by those who train us, our parents. I think that though through the eating of the apple we gained knowledge of both good and evil, we also deadened our conscience of both. I often think of my training in a Christian family, and wonder if I had been in a different family whether I would or would not be the way I am now. I doubt it. Without the emphasis of the good of good, and consequences of the bad and evil, and especially Jesus, His love, but also His expectations of His people, without all this I doubt I really would ever have an idea of it. I doubt I would feel guilty after doing wrong if I had not been raised this way. If I was raised with the idea was that truth is all relative, that I have the right to do whatever I wanted, however harmful it might be to me, it would appeal to the sinfulness of my nature to live accordingly. And yet no matter how we are raised, it is possible to realize the existence of God, and good and evil. The book of Romans says so.

      Sometimes I think that growing up, as in growing more mature, is first learning to recognize what is good, then why it’s good, how to do good. And the same with truth: we learn what is true, why it’s true, and how we can speak for the truth. Again, same with beauty: we learn what’s beautiful, why it’s beautiful, how we can use our talents to make beautiful things, and we do all these things to the glory of our Creator.

Thus I embark on the journey which centers on Isabel Archer. I’m not so sure about Isabel at the moment; I like her, but she’s going to get herself into trouble. Ralph is certainly my favorite character at the moment; rather sickly on the outside, but brilliant on the inside, with a satirical personality—I love it! Ralph’s father I enjoy; his mother I don’t think I like very well, but not because she’s bad. And Lord Warburton! I eagerly exclaim along with Isabel, “Oh, I hoped there would be a lord; it’s just like a novel!”

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sometimes have a hard time justifying God’s wrath with His love. I think I’ve figured it out now, and because I have it down I’m having a hard time figuring out why it didn’t compute originally! But for a while the two just didn’t fit. That a God who loves us so much, should have such a strong wrath again sinners, or those who continue in it, just didn’t seem to compute with me for a while. Now the Lord has blessed me with an answer.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God is perfect. He is totally good, and He is truth, goodness and beauty in perfection. He is absolutely righteous and holy. As He is all of the above, as He is perfectly good and holy, it logically follows that He must hate all that is the opposite of good: evil and sin. So it also follows that He should hate the sin that&nbsp; we  commit. But he also is a loving, merciful God. That doesn’t mean that He could simply let us off the hook, because He loved us; if He is holy, than justice must be done. He loves the part of us that was not sinful, He loves us as the creatures He originally made without the stain of sin, and He longs to rescue us from it, and give us the full joy of knowing our Creator face to face. He still hates sin, and evil. He holds a righteous wrath against sin, yet He loved us so much that he sent His precious Son to become our precious Savior. As the words of the song “In Christ Alone” go, “On that cross as Jesus died, the wrath of God was satisfied.” So He’s given us a way out of our sin. He still has a righteous anger against sin and evil, for He is purely and perfectly good, yet He exercised His love to get us out of our sin, that He could make Himself fully known to us in eternity. Justice was still done, but it was done with mercy toward us.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To those who choose to remain wicked and refuse to repent His terrible wrath is turned. They had a way out. Our generous God gave them a chance, and if they do not take it is right that He should be angry against them. In his sermon on Sunday, my Dad spoke about the difference between human anger, which is wrong, and righteous anger. Righteous anger is anger that is directed at evil that is harming the Church, or bringing dishonor to God’s holy name.  I don’t know if this answer makes any sense in the way I’ve communicated it here, but how wonderful it is when God shows you the answer to a question, or doubt, or simply gives you a peace in Him that make trusting Him and having faith in Him and His mercy, grace and justice, easier.

      “…Realize that when children are read to, they can comprehend at a higher reading level than when they read to themselves.”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --- The Book Tree: A Christian Reference for Children’s Literature  by Elizabeth McCallum and Jane Scott, 2001  This is so true. My dad has been reading aloud to my sister and me ever since I can remember. When I was 9 years old he read  Great Expectations  aloud to us. I remember having little trouble understanding it, but I’m sure if I tried to read it by myself then, I would have had much trouble. Then, only a few months ago, I read it myself, and was astonished at how much I remembered of it. I had such clear images from the time we had read it together, and I haven’t watched any film adaptation of it at all, so they couldn’t have been from a movie. By the way,  Great Expectations  is now one of my favorite books of all time, and certainly my favorite of all Dicken’s books that I’ve read. I could also tell you of the time Dad read Mark Twain’s  Puddin’ Head Wilson  aloud to me, but that’s a whole other story. I once met a woman who said that when she was pregnant with each of her children she read a book aloud of each of them, even before they were born. Each book she read to each one, turned out to be their favorite book, I think one of them was the  Lord of the Rings  Trilogy. Isn’t that neat?

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I think we (Christians) have some problems with the way we often present what we believe to non-believers, and if that is a problem, then it follows that there would also be a problem with the way they now view us, in light of how we present ourselves. The fact is, we often are much more open and declare “God loves you” “Jesus loves you”, and that sort of thing much more than “Sin is wrong” and “God hates sin”. I think when we are trying to make non-believers think about these things, we often put forward God’s love, more than His wrath against sin. This makes absolutely no sense. Let me explain.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why are Christians so glad that God loves us? How has He manifested that love to us? What did that manifestation do? You see, we can’t go very far on the subject of God’s love, without bumping into our own sin, and God’s righteous hatred of it. There is a book called,  Repentance: The First Word of the Gospel . I haven’t read it, and I don’t even know who it’s by, but I’ve heard the title, and it makes so much sense. How can one truly experience God’s love if he has not experienced conviction of his own sin? If a person does not know of his own sin, and the deep offence it gives God, how can he be thankful for and accept God’s love and His Son? If we do not experience deep conviction of our sin, how can we experience deep conviction of God’s love, and what He’s has done for us because He loves us? In the beginning of John Bunyan’s  The Pilgrim’s Progress , Christian is mainly troubled with his “burden” which is his sin. He is first confronted with the conviction of his sin weighing on him, not God’s love, that comes later when he ventures out to get rid of that burden.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In declaring God’s love over and over, and next to nothing about His hatred of sin, we sometimes use the excuse that non-believers would shrink away from a hateful God, but draw closer to a loving one. In doing this, we greatly underestimate the power of the Holy Spirit, to work in a person and convict them of their sins, and make their hearts ready to receive the gospel. Christians spend so much time making their worship services attractive to the non-Christian, “seeker sensitive”. Not to mention that if someone starts coming to church just because it’s music is, at the time, “cool”, or we’ve just made our service more “attractive”, a non-Christian could easily switch to some other religion, or group, because it has become more attractive than the church. We are inviting non-Christians for the wrong reasons. We water down God’s gospel, and His hatred of sin. We try to make Christianity attractive to the non-believer. The fact is we don’t have to do anything to make Christianity attractive for those who are not part of it. God will work in them to do that. We should spend our time in the service worshiping the Lord, and preaching and teaching from His Word.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I also believe that all this detracts from God’s primary tool: the family. God uses families in very special ways and when we love Him and keep His commandments, He promises to bless us to “a thousand generations” (Exodus 20:6). His servant, Joshua, also declares, “As for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.” (Joshua 24:15). It is very crucial and important that we continue to share the gospel in our families, to educate our children in the Word of the Lord, to set an example for them. If we do all those things, if it be God’s will, godliness and faith will continue to the thousandth generation as well. We must raise up a generation in the Lord which will shed light to all others, that they may see God in us.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In light of all this, our over emphasis of God’s love to non-believers, and little of His hatred of sin, non-Christians might view us more and more as those who “pretend” to be loving, but are really “intolerant” and “hateful”, with regard to our stand on abortion and homosexuality. This only creates more problems. We should not hesitate to say, “Abortion is wrong, homosexuality is wrong. They are sins. God hates sin, for He is perfectly righteous. Yet He is also loving and merciful, and has provided a way out of our sin in His Son, Jesus.” God is loving and merciful, yet He also hates sin, and, consequently, the sin that we commit. These two traits are not opposites; I have more to say on that later, in another post I’m preparing.

      I saw another interesting movie two weeks ago.  The Remains of the Day  (PG) stars Emma Thompson, and Anthony Hopkins. It’s the story of the head butler (Hopkins) of the large estate of Lord Darlington. Soon after World War I, Lord Darlington begins to get involved with Germany, in an attempt to help them after the war. He meets with many important people from around the world. That’s the big world. Then the little world is the world of Mr. Stevens, the butler, and the housekeeper, Miss. Kenton, who give orders to the other servants, and manage the house and all its inhabitants. While the affairs of the world are being decided, they clean the silver and watch what’s going on. As Lord Darlington increasingly becomes the dupe of Nazi Germany, Mr. Stevens and Miss Kenton must decide how they shall respond to it, and what their relationship is to their master, and each other. It is a very interesting movie, and has beautiful cinematography. All the movies I’ve seen with Emma Thompson in them have always been of a high quality, and when they are movies adapted from books, they are great examples of what it is to take a book and adapt it to film. One thing I like about it is it really doesn’t have a typical Hollywood ending at all, it surprises you with reality. ( Sense and Sensibility , and  Howards End  are great examples of this, and I will be writing more on both later.)

      I watched a very interesting movie on Sunday called  Shattered Glass . It’s a true story about a journalist for  The New Republic , Stephen Glass, and takes place in the late 1990’s. He writes interesting and amusing articles, many of which turn out to be fabricated. He writes up fake notes, fake voice mails, fake e-mails, and fake web-pages so that he won’t get caught. As his editor begins to get suspicious, he&nbsp;uses every excuse and blames every other person, thing, or circumstance but himself. The other writers for the magazine enjoy and like Stephen, so they make excuses for him, too, until they finally see that their editor is only doing his job when he fires Stephen. It’s a really a fascinating film, it also gives you a look inside the job of being a journalist. (Rated PG-13 for language and sexual references.)

      I’m planning to write out my thoughts on E.M. Forster’s  Howards End,  which I finished this week, and  The Chosen , by Chaim Potok. But first I need to get my thoughts all ironed out and then write them down, so it may be a while. By the way, since no one responded to my question in the “I Will Be Back!” post, I am reading Henry James’s  The Portrait of a Lady . Also I’ve written a lengthy post that needs to be edited a bit before I’ll publish it, about God’s love and His hatred of sin.

      I love it when I find a verse in the Bible that really solidifies something I’ve been thinking about, just seems special at the time, or sticks in my head for a long time after I first read it. Sometimes some verses seem to be precious for some reason or another and I just want to hold on to them like jewel. Look at this:&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If you repent, I will restore you&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that you may serve me;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if you utter worthy, not worthless, words,&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you will be my spokesman.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let this people turn to you,&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but you must not turn to them.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will make you a wall to this people,&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a fortified wall of bronze;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will fight against you&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but will not overcome you&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I am with you&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to rescue and save you,”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeremiah 15:19-20, NIV   I think this is, to some extent a summary of the Christian’s life in this world. When we repent, God restores us, He saves us from sin. We must therefore, obey His holy law and commands, and if we do and we “utter worthy, not worthless words” we will become a spokesman for God. I believe the English Standard Version translates that as “My mouth”, so we’d become God’s mouth, if our own speech is worthy. So we must speak to the people (in this case, I believe Jeremiah is being told to speak to the people of Israel, who have strayed from the Lord) whom we could also take as those Christians who have gone astray, or, perhaps, the un-reached. And though we speak to them, though we live among them, we must not become of them or like them. We must not succumb to evil, though it surrounds us completely. We will become a wall which the Lord fortifies and makes strong enough that those who fight against it will not overcome it, and it will not crumble. All this is because the Lord is with us; His presence is among us. Yet if we stray ourselves we will be without God to fortify our wall, and we will crumble with the others.

      I’ll be away for this next week, but after that I’ll be back with more posts. Summer’s almost over and I can’t wait for school to begin. I’m starting a Great Books course this year, which I’m really looking forward to. While I’m away I’m going to begin Homer’s Iliad! Exciting.

      I’m so disgusted with Hollywood. Besides Planned Parenthood and John Kerry, it seems like the one of the greatest evils in America. I like seeing movies in the theater. I check different Christian movie review sites, and look for something our family could go see together, but it’s very rare when something comes up. It’s not just because my parents wouldn’t allow me to watch them, but I myself wouldn’t feel comfortable watching them anyway. Many of them sound funny or interesting, but they are fatally marred with violence, gore, sexual content, coarse jokes, and bad language. In many cases, the plot could be good, but the added content makes it highly objectionable. I suppose to some extent, it’s good. Not because the content is good, but it makes our family watch less TV and movies in general, I think, and read more. That’s always a good thing. Unfortunately, I fear that’s not the case with other Christian families. A poll in Plugged In showed that many Christians do watch R rated films.

                          I think that the glory of God’s creation is so often thought to be mainly its beauty, but I’ve been realizing that merely the originality of God’s creation is wondrous, and filled with His glory.                      We, as humans, tend to judge heavenly things by our own earthly experience, which is foolish. God is the center of the universe; he is its Creator, and the Master of all things. He is not only one who knows all things, but he is the Creator of all things. He is perfectly righteous, and our entire purpose is to give glory to the Being who created us. Not only did he create us, but loved us, and in his love, sent his Son to die for our sins, that we might be covered with his perfect righteousness, and live eternally with him. In light of all he is and all he’s done for us, should we not judge what we see by his standards revealed to us, rather than our own petty, corrupted, earthly experience?                      What does this have to do with God’s creation? Well, what we first see is the beauty of creation, and in it, we see its Creator. Psalm 19:1 says, “The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above his handiwork.” In the first chapter of Romans, Paul writes, “For what can be known about God is plain to them because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes, namely his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made.” But in creation, if you think about it, the thing that will strike you with the glory of the Creator is not only its beauty, but its originality. God is the Master Artist and Inventor. He not only paints beautifully, but he paints, not a copy of anything, not even something which is inspired by something else, something that is totally original. Out of absolute darkness and blackness, the earth was formed, and the sky above it.                      This, perhaps, doesn’t sound so wondrous. But think of it this way: try to create an animal, and don’t copy any of the animals that you’ve seen or even heard of. Don’t use feathers, wings, tails, scales, etc. Don’t even let yourself get ideas from other animals. So, what happened? I tried this for a while and couldn’t come up with anything without coping features of animals which already existed. Now think of this: God created animals when there were no other animals to copy or be inspired by. In fact, he created even the idea of an animal. Quite an imagination, don’t you agree?                      God not only creates totally original things, but he makes all of his creation work perfectly. I don’t mean that our world is perfect, that is, it was before the fall of man, just that it works fit together perfectly. Think of the rising and setting of the sun, think of the seasons, and gravity. In Genesis 8:22 the Lord says, “While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease.” God created all of these things and forces. I was sitting in my backyard reading, and I looked randomly at a blade of grass. As I looked, I thought, “You know there really isn’t a lot of beauty in one strand of grass. There is in a field of grass, but one single strand doesn’t seem like such a big deal.” Then I asked myself what the purpose of grass was. In science this year we learned that without grass, the soil under it would wash away when it rained. Grass holds the soil and dirt together, so to speak. Not only does the grass perfectly serve its purpose, but it does it with a beauty that gives such a tribute to its Creator. A grassy field with sunlight streaming on it, glistening on the morning dew, and wind making it ripple like water, is a pleasant thing to look at. No, maybe one strand of grass isn’t such a big deal, but I know I never would have been able to create it myself, let alone create it out of nothing, from nothing, with nothing, and with no original idea from which to branch off.                      When I think about this I just feel so much the creative power of our God. How awesome are his works! How wonderful it is to be one of his creations and give him glory! It certainly is good.
