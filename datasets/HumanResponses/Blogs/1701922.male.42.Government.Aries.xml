      Inspired by the  urlLink Great Cerebus re-read  that I'm taking part in I've decided to approach Promethea in the same way.  Tentative dates Mondays to Sundays If you prefer just treat it as 6 weeks to read Books 1-3 and 7 weeks to read Books 4-5.  Firstly read the issue/book then read my annotations to same. The best place to do this is at the  urlLink http://www.enjolrasworld.com/Annotations/Alan%20Moore/Promethea/Promethea.htm">enjolrasworld mirror  of my  urlLink Promethea Annotations .  Come up with any Q&A's and observations not covered in my annotations, also specific questions for specific people such as colorist Jeromy Cox or letterer Todd Klein, etc. You might also want to consider any extras in the books not shown in specific issues such as dedications, the illustrations & descriptions between issues, the sketches shown in Book 1. Covers and how they relate to the internal artwork.  Readers letters appeared in the first 16 issues but were not reprinted. If like me you don't have copies of these individual issues they can be found here:   urlLink Issues #2-#9   urlLink Issues #10-#16   People who sent the letters might care to comment or other people could pick up on points raised by these letters.  Re-read Q&A's etc. to be found at my  urlLink Yahoo Promethea Group     RE-READ SCHEDULE    JULY  5-11 Issue #1 12-18 Issue #2 19-25 Issue #3 26-1 Aug Issue #4  AUGUST  2-8 Issue #5 9-15 Issue #6 16-22 Issue #7 23-29 Issue #8 30-5 Sep Issue #9  SEPTEMBER  6-12 Issue #10 13-19 Issue #11 20-26 Issue #12 27-3 Oct Issue #13  OCTOBER  4-10 Issue #14 11-17 Issue #15 18-24 Issue #16 25-31 Issue #17  NOVEMBER  1-7 Issue #18 8-14 Issue #19 15-21 Issue #20 22-28 Issue #21 29-5 Dec Issue #22  DECEMBER  6-12 Issue #23 13-19 Issue #24 20-26 Issue #25 (Xmas might get in the way here so maybe we could just carry this on into early January)    XMAS/NEW YEARS BREAK  JANUARY  10-16 Issue #26 17-23 Issue #27 24-30 Issue #28 31-6 Feb Issue #29  FEBRUARY  7-13 Issue #30 14-20 Issue #31 21-28 Issue #32

      I won't be putting the whole of my Bibliography for the  PGB  online but just the  urlLink Primary Bibliography . It's too big to put on this Updates page but clikc on the name to get to the webpage. I still have to add Little Margie in Misty Magic Land and all the Tom Strong issues that refer to Promethea.

      In my preparation for trying to write my  Promethea Guide Book  (or  PGB  as I refer to it) I'm hoping for some feedback from other readers and fans of the book. Here is a questionnaire for my research. Please provide answers by the end of September 2004.  As an incentive to answer whoever provides the best answers gets a copy of  urlLink Big Numbers  #1.       urlLink Image Source     1) Are you male or female? 2) If you could ask Alan Moore and JH Williams one or two questions (about Promethea) what would they be? 2.5) Ditto for any of the following:        a. Editor: Scott Dunbier       b. Inker: Mick Gray       c. Colorist: Jeromy Cox       d. Letterer: Todd Klein       e. Digital Artist: Jose Villarubia       f. Charles Vess (Charlton Sennett story pgs 8-15 in Issue #4)   3) Who is your favourite/least favourite character in Promethea and why? 4) What is your favourite/least favourite storyline in Promethea and why?(Choose one issue if you like) 5) Which is your favourite cover and why?  6) What appeals to you most in Promethea: the ‘superheroics’; the ‘spiritualism’; the literary side or the historical angle? 7) Has Promethea sustained your interest? Is it as compelling now as when it began (or vice versa)? If your interest waned, can you say when/why? 8) How does Promethea measure up to other (similar) comics you've read? 9) Are there any (similar) works you'd like to recommend? 10) Has reading Promethea prompted you to read up on, for example, Magic; Aleister Crowley or the Kaballah?  If you have answers to any of the above or can think of any other questions you think I should ask but haven't please send them to me    urlLink eroomnala@yahoo.com.au

      Quoting from myself and my original proposal for this book (I'll update this entry as I change my mind about what to include in the book itself):  I see this book as something of a hybrid lying somewhere between Hy Bender’s  urlLink The Sandman Companion   (Titan Books, 1999)  ISBN: 1-84023150-5 HC or  ISBN: 1-84023-164-5 TPB  and Jess Nevins'  urlLink  Heroes & Monsters: The Unofficial Companion to the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  (MonkeyBrain Books, 2003)  ISBN: 1-932265-04-X    PROPOSED TITLE     From the Radiant Heavenly City to {...} (the end of the World?):    A Guide to  Alan Moore & JH Williams III's  Promethea  (1999-2004)     where {...} is the title of Issue #32 as long as it's something appropriate.     Proposed Official Publication Date   November 18th, 2005    CONTENTS    an  Introduction  followed by a chapter on all of the covers and the artists that inspired them entitled  32  which might also include information about other artists important to Promethea such as William Blake, Hieronymous Bosch and Peter Breughel who have some influence on Issue #12, then a breakdown of the whole of Promethea something like  1st story arc ( Sophie earns her wings )  Book One - Issues 1-6  Book Two - Issues 7-12  2nd story arc ( The Kabbalah Road Trip )  Book Three - Issues 13-18  Book Four - Issues 19-25  3rd story arc (have to think of a title for this probably something about  the End  of the World )  Book Five - Issues 26-32   I was thinking of starting the introduction with something like  "Like Douglas Adams Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Alan Moore's Promethea is a trilogy in 5 parts...."  but somewhere in there I'd credit  urlLink  Jess Nevins annotations  and Heroes and Monsters as the inspiration for my own output.  If I just published a text book without illustrations I would include the annotations but if I had illustrations I might not actually reproduce all the annotations but instead make references to them and do what Hy Bender has done with his Sandman companion. Namely outline the plots of each issue and then do questions and answers about each issue with Alan and JHWilliams, etc.  Essay topics would probably be something like  One about   Magic   with subheadings parts about    Dr. John Dee (1527-1608)   Aleister Crowley (1875-1947)    Austin Osman Spare (1886-1956)   Jack Parsons (1914-1952)  Another essay on all the   Literature or Real books mentioned in Promethea   These include:    Helen Cixious  urlLink Le Livre de Promethea    The Lesser Clavicle of Solomon the King  Lucian's A True Story   John Kendrick Bang's A Houseboat on the Styx and it's sequel The Pursuit of the Houseboat   plus bits about all the Crowley and associated books that you can see at Jack Faust's place at different times plus any fictional books and if known the works they are based on.   Themes  Of the book such as the snake symbolism that recurs throughout, the dichomoty and fusion of different aspects of individual characters such as Jack Faust, Crowley   Miscellaneous  Interesting coincidences such as the   urlLink Promethea Movement  which came into existence at around the same time as Alan first got the idea of using Promethea as a comic book title the fact that the first cloned horse in the world was named Prometea or that at one time back in the 70’s  urlLink Pasolini  was interested in helping to produce  a film to be called  urlLink  La Prométhée ('The Female Prometheus')    urlLink Interviews   I would also include a   Chronological Time Line of Events   (here's a  urlLink preliminary version  of this)   and an  A-Z Character Index  with additional information about what issues characters appeared in  Preliminary versions of   urlLink Issues #1-#25    urlLink Issue 26-32  I've already done a much better updated version of these two combined but I won't put that online now.  Maybe a few  Appendixes  (appendices?) about    urlLink Little Margie in Misty Magic Land    and  urlLink  Release Dates    and  urlLink  Sales Figures    Also  Print Runs  which can be found at the  urlLink 4 color Heroes store . plus a listing of all the  Awards and Nominations  Promethea has gotten over the years.  Information about  Foreign Editions  and where to purchase them And of course at the end an updated   urlLink  Bibliography

      People I need to interview for the book would include    Alan Moore   urlLink JH Williams III    urlLink Mick Gray    urlLink Jeromy Cox    urlLink Todd Klein   Scott Dunbier   urlLink Jose Villarubia   Charles Vess   urlLink Eric Shanower     Some I've already  urlLink interviewed  but will have to re-interview them again once  urlLink Issue #32  and Book #5 are published. I'd also like to interview Steve Moore (author of the Little Margie in Misty Magic Land stories) but apparently he's even more reclusive than Alan and never gives interviews
