						   Tears of the Giraffe is the second book in the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series. I don't think these books qualify as "literature" by a long stretch, but everyone I've ever talked to who has read them (mostly women) absolutely loved them, and raved about "Tears" in particular.   The series is set in Botswana, which, if you believe the author, is about the happiest place in Africa. Still, it is in Africa, and the writing really gives you a feel for the completely different pace of life there. The main character, Mma Ramotswe, is a large, practical, Solomon-type figure who can see through to the heart of any situation. Her intuition makes her the best (and only) lady detective in Botswana.  I enjoyed the first book, "No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency." It's like comfort food for your brain. It's funny, light, and uplifting without being stupid-- I think that's very hard to do.  But "Tears" left me a little cold. The first novel is episodic: Mma Ramotswe takes on cases and solves them. In the second novel, the author tried to intertwine several different plots, plus develop the love stoy that he plans to run through all of the series (5 books so far--I looked ahead) and didn't quite pull it off. As a result, it was easy to forget about one set of characters while reading about another, and harder to care about any of them.  Still, I recommend either book anytime as a feel-good alternative to what's on TV.

						   Halfway through this read I realized this wasn't the first Erickson book I've read. I'm not sure if that's a testament to his unique style or the fact that Erickson has one story to tell with a different setting and different characters.  In any case this was a very good book and masterfully written. Broken up into easily digestible, short chapters it's the kind of book you might think you can read ten minutes at a time. Of course two hours later, it's hard to put down. By the end of the story he has woven nearly all the abstract characters or loose ends together brilliantly.  My only warning: This is not an uplifting book and it touches on the darkest parts of human nature which resonate a little uncomfortably sometimes. It is however, honest, well written and if you look for it somewhat hopeful (even if it's not always obvious).  -pk

						   In keeping with the trend of writing about books you aren't finished-- For the longest time I thought this book was about a ship, or a part of England, and I avoided it. But I found out that it's about a hermaphrodite, and written by the author of the Virgin Suicides, and I had to check it out. It's amazing. It's shocking, tasteful, realistic, touching, and really makes you think about how people form identities. The writing itself is awesome; there's one scene where, in order to set up a flashback, he describes the events of the past 30 years happening in reverse, literally "rewinding" the narrative. I highly recommend it (as highly as I can recommend a book I've read half of).

						   This is a great summer read.  Equally engaging and saddening, Sebold does a touching job of taking the reader through a family's life after the death of their daughter.  An interesting perspective on the grief and healing of the family, her book is an easy and compelling read.  My only complaint is minor.  At one point she gets a bit taken by her own cleverness, but the scene hardly ruins the tone and flow of the book.  Definitely worth picking up.    Anyone else have any thoughts?

						   Okay, so this is a bad first blog on two counts.  One, I haven't finished the book, and two, it isn't very mainstream popular... But, regardless.  So, the reason I began reading this book started with a trip to Europe.  I met this fellow in Brugue, Belgium who was a thirty-something travelling through Europe after quitting his job and striking out to find his passion in life.  This book, he told me, was what changed his life and his priorities.  Of course, I had to read it... He did warn me though that Henry Miller was a bit chauvenistic throughout...  On that one point he didn't really let me down.  However, halfway through, I've yet to have the inspiration strike.  So I'm wondering... is this a gender gap difference?  I like the writing, and the tone is oddly addicting, and yet, I can't finish...

						   I was roaming around the bookstore today, something I've always loved to do, when a strange new feeling overtook me as I wandered.  I felt a little lost.  I've been submerged in textbooks for so long that I've lost track of what's new, trendy and fun to read (not to mention  good ).  So here we are.  This blog is about what you're reading that you like, and don't like.  I want to get a group of people I love and admire to help me out by pitching in their thoughts on the books sitting by their beds.  The general idea is to tell a bit about the book, and what you thought about it.  Book title and author go in the "title" spot, and the bulk of it is left to you.  Try to give the reader a feel for what the book's like:  is it a beach read or a serious-enlighten-me-in-the-coffeeshop read?  You get the idea...  So, let's get started already!
