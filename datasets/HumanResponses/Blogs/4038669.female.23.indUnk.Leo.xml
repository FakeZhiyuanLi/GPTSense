      so last night i was meant to be packing all my clothes to move them into my uncle's house tomorrow.. but i got home and couln't be bothered to do anything except lie on the sofa and watch tv.... i think i needed to do that really.. was exhausted. Found  a few more of these horrible little beetles in the kitchen.. they are everywhere in that house, I have to say I'm not overly upset to be moving out of that place.... really looking forward to living at P&E's for a bit, what with one thing and another i feel like it will be good for me to spend some time with family members for a bit.. this weekend should be a good one, all of us together... even if it is a bit of an odd set up.. like we are gathering to celebrate Chloe's birthday but also to almost 'say goodbye' to Nick, to someone who is still alive... to mourn someone before they even die... it's really the most surreal thing. Listening to Cliff Martinez at the moment, the soundtrack to Solaris.. I love film soundtracks.. perhaps because I'm always convinced that I live in a film, well, maybe not a film.. more like a bad episode of Eastenders! I just ate some sausage and mash and now i feel like a pregnant cow....

      Oh dear.... dare I say it... I'm feeling pretty happy today.. although this might have something to do with the fact that I have had only about four hours sleep and imbibed a fair amount of alcohol last night.. went out for drinks at market bar, then onto two floors, then to kulu kulu for sushi and then onto The End, to a night called 'Trash'... I tell you what, I have never laughed so much in my life.. I mean the place is all the bad parts of shoreditch with none of the good (are there any good elements of shoreditch??) all these pouting doe eyed saps with ridiculously ugly haircuts, pathetic 'retro' outfits - (a mickey mouse jumper worn with a ra-ra skirt.. i ask you!) and this constant look of 'who's looking at me... who's LOOKING AT ME' on their faces... I can't understand where these people are coming from.. they hoestly believe they're really 'living it'... that they are so 'out there'... but they aren't, they're just fucking sheep.. in an effort to look so individual and cool, they end uup looking like pathetic losers, clones of one another... stupid floppy languid girls and tossers wearing sunglasses indoors... HA HA HA!!! Oh well.. at least it gave me something to laugh at.. that and Daniel's complete dumbness.. that made me laugh! We're standing there and this guy starts sort of joining in our conversation, with a strong accent... Daniel's like 'where are you from, mexico?' (fair enough question) he says 'no, peru'.. then, THEN... Daniel says to him 'do you breed llamas?'... to which the guy got quite annoyed... in fact, in retrospect it's really pretty funny, and I would have found it so had I not just been astounded at how stupid Daniel sounded.. anyway, that's not really an issue, he's absolutely gorgeous, and we have a real laugh together.. which is cool... so I'm generally pretty  satisfied today, if a little bored at work, but the sporadic butterfly attacks that keep occuring when i think about lying next to him in bed are definately helping my day along.. mmmmm!

      I just cant seem to get excited about anything today.. in fact i have been feeling this way for a while.. it's getting mighty boring... was just talking to Maria and she was filling me in on her weekend back in New York... various bits of gossip about people I will never meet.. luckily enough I'm a big fan of soap operas, so feel that these insights into the lives of these New Yorkers I don't know are actually somewhat interesting. All I do is gossip at the moment, mostly abou tmyself.. which i i suppose is rather sad, ahem. I have to start packing up my life again, moving house on thursday, well moving into my uncle's for a couple of months before I am to move in with about a million people in East London... funny how this time last year I swore blind that I would never never leave NW London.. then again, this time last year I was in love and planning my childrens names with my (now ex) boyfriend.. strange how much my perspective has changed in a relatively short amount of time.. going through another massive lifestyle overhaul (yet again).. there's a definate pattern forming.. every year a different area of london, a new love life, a new outlook on my career... blah blah blah.. found a very odd outline of a story/film idea in my diary today... have little recollection of writing it, but I think I could have some fun developing it... maybe that will quell my boredom....

      i'm wondering if there is some hormonal link to my craving for seafood... just eaten a prawn salad.. feeling a bit sick now though.. perhaps theres a link there too.. hmmm... what to have for dinner.. crab i think.. oh shellfish. Work's dull today, in fact it's been like this for a while now; only thing is, I know there are a few things that I am putting off doing which are getting bigger and bigger with every day that I put them off.... damnit.
