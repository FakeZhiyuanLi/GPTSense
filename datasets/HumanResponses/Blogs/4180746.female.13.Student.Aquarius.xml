      After much thinking and sessions of listening to the song by Alanis Morissette i have finally understood the meaning of this small word which means soo much (sorry dictionaries dont work when im obsessed with a word) I shoud really get an allowance raise..seriously i need extra money have to get soo much stuff.....so much stuff so little money someone should start up a charity for me since theres no concept of working on weekends and getting paid in Pakistan...yahan per to even barey ppl dun get paid school students to bechare.....hai hai poor me and poor u and poor everyone.Actually the world is poor but then do i care aslongas i get what i want?NO but the thing is i dont get what i want for reasons to complex to explain or maybe cus i dont want to tell anyone about them life is strange..ironic...  Are u really the person who ive been thinkin about for the past 1 year? No So you have no right whatsoever to knwo about my personal matters. Do i sound too rude?oh sorry i didnt realise it hurts you too much. Cus arent u that air headed doll those guys like? Or that chotey kapron waalee who the bmw waalas want on their arm? Hanging...or should i say acting like the typical whore? But then thats ok right?as long as they like u *sigh* U= Swan......ME=Ugly duckling. Does it matter? Yes Do i care ? Yes Why? Cus brains arent everything. I know what theyll say. Brains are what matter. But if given a hoice who would they take? the 5"5 slender swan or the 5"2 ugly duckling? The swan ofcourse. Hypocrisy is the essense of this society. And no one can change that Maybe i dont want it to change, But then i do, I hope it does Cus id love to see the day when brains matter more to those BMW waalas than beauty.

      Aaah pissed again for no apparent reason maybe because my social life has come to an end for some reasons described in a previous post,mot naming it go see for yourselves will do u some good if u actually work hard sometimes hmmphh!  Didnt talk at school for about 2 hrs for no apparent reason.....people always tell me to shutup but now that i did they wanted me to talk....weird people guess what i did? i didnt talk so friends tried to get me to talk by using every mean they had insulting my crush included which ws pissing off to say the least but i still didnt talk....willpowers working afterall..   Just walk down quietly, And pray to your god, Maybe your gods not alive, But wont he still hear u? Our holy blasphemy, Union of sins, So damn sacred, Your precious darkness, And the unholy grim, Takes hold of me and you, And it really wont let go, Beliefs of mine, Sacrilegious for you, Religion for me, But we keep on going , hand in hand, Its too late to return, Too late to take a stand, So lets lead on our doubts, And go where your god takes us, And mine.   yeah i know its crap but as you all know school has screwd my brains. so until we meetnext time byee byee!

      Just came back from school feeling like a rubber band .....and an angry one at that. Teachers are the most crule ppl who ever lived on the surface of the Earth...especially ours who have this knack for pulling us like rubber bands and i feel that someday i break like one *TWANG* and thatll be the end of me and the mental balance i have retained till now.If i knew that we were going to be treated like this i wouldnt have worked so hard on retaining my mental capabilities. Teachers come into class and tell us that there will be no tests today.....no science tests no geography tests....oh and that they forgot to tell us yesterday even though they knew ...WOW! thats pretty nice u just "forgot" and made us sit up like sleepy donkeys drinking coke,red bull and mountain dew and coming to school like zombies....ever heard of beauty sleep?i got a pimple cus of the teachers hmmph!!and then the fukin asshole we have for a principal saw me copying a sum out of this gals book oh man im in shit....  Singing arabic hymns is just not my thig but how do u explain to teachers? i dunno sumone please get me Alanis Morissetes Ironic.....

      Why?this sux    big time     no just tell me why?  If hes there in the hospital its not really my fault....yes i should be feeling bad or sad or whatever way you want to put itbut i just dont i dont feel like hating him but then i cant help it and i know its a sin to hate him...  Hes my father and tahts why i have no right to hate him...hes earned everything i have today. Then why?is it beacause whne he goes from this realm to another ill have 4 half-siblings after our blood?or is it beacuase of his ego which didnt let him make the right choices and put us all in this situation...it makes me sigh it make me cry its all hopeless theres nothing to be done ...u cant change luck can u?i just wish i was in a different place at a different time and most of all i wasnt a stupid 13 year old who cant change her life just wish that things would change for the better and that i would stop crying.  I cudve called thsi blog sanaas wishes instead of naked intensity..
