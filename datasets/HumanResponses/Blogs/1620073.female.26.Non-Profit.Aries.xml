      Well here is my second post.  Will resolve not to start next post with the word "well".  But we'll see how that goes.  Went on a walk in the Dandenongs (the big mountains that contribute to the fact that it's always cold in Melbourne).  Discussed many phenomenon of being cold.  Like when you're using the mouse on the computer too much and your mouse hand gets all cold.  This results in the technical medical term "mouse hand" - when one hand is colder than the other.  It may also occur in the snow when you've been to the loo and you can only bear subjecting one hand to the cold water.  Invention for the day:  Heated computer mouses.  (Possibly with heated mouse pads).  Thanks to Paul for this.

      Well here it is.  Lovely Melbourne weather today.  (I didn't want to start off with comments on the weather, but as I am wrapped in a sleeping bag with my coat on it just couldn't escape me.)  It's cold.  Once when we were kids on a holiday in Lakes Entrance we had swimming lessons.  It was cold then too.  I was a pretty good kid but I refused to get in the water.  When asked why not, I said the water was so cold you could skate on it and told the swimming instructor that she should test it.  How come they always got to wear jumpers over their bathers?  Invention for the day:  Heated floaties for the cold who are learning to swim.  Preferably not solar panelled.

      Talked to Mum and Dad before and after Dad's induction about Philosophy and the like.  "And what are you going to do after that, Ainsley?" Shrugs shoulders.  Got home at about 12:30.  Got up with David this morning.  Might be afternoon snooze time or cuppa tea time soon.    Mmmmmmmm, tea.  As if anyone is going to ask for "Earl Grey, cold."  Stupid Star Trek!!!!  I think I am going to a Philosophy Conference in Adelaide for next week.  Scary.  So I might miss a few days blogging.  Mum's  like, you might meet people.  I hate meeting people.  Went to the library at uni and had my house mate borrow a book for me.  It's about Lucretius's morality system and how "death is nothing to us" and all that.  I sound dismissive, but it is only because it is too complex to be bothered typing out on a mere blog.  The author gets right into it (I read one of the chapters for a third year course a few years ago) and it is pretty thick reading.  Invention for the day:  Telepathic typing mechanism that types what you think (thus eliminating the need for air bags on keyboards as you can type while resting your head on a pillow).

      Found out David didn't invent the term Ontological Shock.  My faith in his vocabulary is shaken.  Got an email!!!  Turns out he was marking first year exams.  That seems excusable (at least it won't happen during semester, except they'll have essays.  Damn.)  Bed time: 12:30am Up time: 10:40am Left house: 12:30pm  Cigaretts: 0 Alcohol Units: 1.5 platinum 7s (vanilla and vodka) and some bundy. Weight: Steady (yay) even with wet hear and towel.  Once again I weigh less that the Aussie Dollar in kilograms vs US cents.  Today I am going to the induction of my dad.  Dad's an Anglican Minister and he is starting at a new parish.  Induction is the ceremony where they introduce you to the new parish and then you start taking services there.  It starts at 8:00 tonight, so I am glad it's not a school night (for me.)  David is coming too, but he doesn't pumpkin* the way I do.  My mother tends to refer to all of these things as "getting done".  After baptism, confirmation, ordination, consecration, induction and marriage I can see why.  *  Pumpkin  - from Cinderella.  Pumpkin time is when it is time to go home (else your carriage turns into pumpkin).  When one gets really tired and is no longer fit for any social contact.  Invention for the day: Sound proof residential construction material (I am sick of hearing Dave's neighbours torture (not play) Tool and Rage Against the Machine bass riffs)

      I am really starting to get into this "not working" thing.  Most of my meals have started to resemble breakfast (in that they involve toast).    I have started getting up later and later and going to bed later and later.  The other night I went to bed at 1:00 in the morning.  That's pretty late for me (my "work" pumpkin time was about 9:30).  But worst of all, I have started watching day time soaps....  and Judge Judy!!!

      Still no email.  It's okay - as long as I don't know what to do, I don't feel bad about not doing it....  Went to the Salvation Army Family Store down near Dandenong today with a group of friends looking at cheap clothes.  I am about a size 12 and my friends were moaning about the fact that most things in the store were size 10-12.  I think it evens out, because whenever I have gone to sales they only have size 8 and 14+ left.  Actually, no, I probably get a better deal if I want lots of cheap clothes.  Op shops are great.  I think my friends are planning an expedition to one that sorts by size.  I think there should be one that sorts by period - this would make shopping for bad 80s clothes for parties so much easier.  Not that we weren't able to find some real gems today.  Invention for the day: Coat hangers that make it impossible for shoe strings dresses and wide necked tops to fall off.

      I haven't done a lot since I last wrote.  I haven't read/bought any of the books I think I was supposed to.  I also was expecting an email from my "soon to be" supervisor, but still nothing.  I sent him an email after I read Lucretius "On the Nature of the Universe".  It was quite good, for a dead Roman guy.  Lucretius wrote the most complete text of the doctrine of Epicurus.  Epicurus is my favourite philosopher.  Just because.  Some Vital Statistics:  Favourite Colour: Purple  Favourite Sesame Street Character: Cookie Monster  Favourite TV Show: The Simpsons  Favourite Movie: Back to the Future I  (BttF) (II and III suffer from "ontological shock"*)  Favourite Sport to watch on TV: One day internation cricket, preferably a day nighter that finishes at about 10:30 local time where Australia bats second.  Favourite Band: I am between bands.  I used to really really like Metallica (well all of the albumns where the name of the albumn is the second song), but they have really gone down hill since 1991, which is 12 years ago.  So they have been crap for about half of my life.  Sigh.  * Ontological Shock - originally termed by  urlLink David Golding  as descriptive of the look on a cats face when you grab their tail just as they are jumping.     Ontology  is the study of what is, or of what exists (a branch metaphysics) and most people know what  shock  is.  However I have taken it to describe what happens to various media (film, tv series, books - often in science fiction) where after an inital product is produced (eg BttF I) additional "things" are introduced into the universe, thereby changing the initial ontology of the series.  A great example of  Strong Ontological Shock  occurs in the second Highlander movie.  In the first movie, the theory of the Highlander and "there can be only one" and all that is explained and the second movie goes "Nah, nah, they're aliens man.  How else could be get a sequel out of it, if we killed 'em all off in the first movie??".  It is Strong Ontological Shock because it undermines what we were told previously.  It remains to be seen if this can be applied to The Matrix movies.  In BttF II the Ontological Shock that was most noticable to me is that Marty can't handle the fact that people call him "chicken".  Now, no-one in the first movie brings his bravery into question (except for perhaps Jennifer when she's telling him to send in his demo tape) so II and III aren't inconsistent with the I, but it just seemed to me like a very jarring plot device to have Marty come back to fights he would normally run away from and then have to run away anyway as Biff (Griff and Mad Dog) are so much bigger than him.  Other examples of  Weak Ontological Shock  are when authors become aware of their own selling power and start to deviate from the main plot and go off on sub-plots to write more books.  Common amongst Fantasy Authors who having set up a quest in the first book, have no idea how to carry it out and have their characters chasing various sub-quests that turn out not to help with the main quest at all.  Although I have not seen much of either, Buffy and Xena (and Charmed) seem to suffer from  Serial Ontological Shock .  Serial Ontological Shock is the "monster of the week" or "spell of the week" or "way to bring back star character from the dead this week" syndrome.  Some may say that some Star Trek also suffers from this Serial Ontological Shock, not just with monsters of the week (of spacial phenomenon too) and also with the setting up of logical/physical barriers that cannot be broken.  "Can't go faster than warp 10."  "Haha," says Paris, "Can too!!"  Does this episode imply that the Captain Janeway is Helen of Troy?  (Well, she does run off with Paris and breed....)  Basically is what happens to Fantasy (or Sci Fi) that hasn't figured out what its ontology or universe rules are and really doesn't give a stuff.  Another Example of the pure form of Ontological Shock is in fourth season Babylon 5.  I thought it was worth mentioning because the nature of the Ontological Shock is that it results in the  removal  of entities rather than the introduction of new ones.  Two of the most powerful species just pack up their little bags and leave the universe (Shadows and Vorlons).  I found this a bit of an anti-climax to something that had been building for two seasons, but I think I'm in the minority.  Perhaps Fight Club is an example of  Cinematographic Ontological Shock .  (The way the movie is shot is misleading to the viewer, but wholley consitent)  Something that is not Ontological Shock (in my opinion anyway) is "revelations" in the movie.  For example, "Luke, I am your father" from Darth Vader in Star Wars V is just a revelation.  If there was something inconsistent with anything previously (and I am kinda ignoring Episodes I-III here) then perhaps it would be Ontological Shock.  (I don't count Luke and Leia kissing as inconsistent.)  Is Ontological Shock a bad thing?  It doesn't have to be.  I think it is only a problem when it conflicts with what the audience is expecting.  I think that certainly Stong Ontological Shock (in the Highlander sense) where the subsequent products undermine (rather than just "shed new light on" (The Matrix?)) what has gone before leaves the audience a bit pissed off.  Certainly if you were reading a murder mystery, then Ontological Shock would really annoy you.  "I think it was Mr Smith, in the library with the candle-stick!"  "Well, no.  Actually I've introduced a new character, Emperor Kang, and he did it.  Didn't pick that, did you?"  Drastic changes in characterisation (BttF) left me a bit annoyed too.  Buffy, Xena and Charmed are popular and the "monster of the week" thing works for them because that is what the audience is expecting - there is no expectation of consistency and if they had the same monster every week or left Buffy dead for a bit, it'd be a little dull.  Invention of the day: Strong and Weak Ontological Shock.

      Next they'll find out that mice cause cancer and that's why there are so many more people with cancer than there used to be because instead of roaming around free they are concentrated in labs where all the medicine is produced and distributed to us all!!!

      Cigarettes - 0 Alcohol Units - 0 Weight - Once a day, just before or after shower.  In an effort to stop sounding like Ms Jones, I have decided to use the first person singular pronoun a little more.  Last night I couldn't be bothered going to bed (as I have to invest a lot of energy into heating the sheets) so I stayed up and watched James Bond videos (Tomorrow Never Dies and The Living Daylights).  After I had heated my snuggle blanket (a small flannelette patchwork number made by my mother) with my body heat and the heater (which can only heat the lounge) I took that to bed with me and went to bed about midnight.  This may seem a little weird and lazy, but you have to understand that I have recently taken a voluntary redundancy from my job of about three years.  (Incase you are aliens, I will explain.  Voluntary Redundancy is where they (them that you work for) give you a lot of money not to work anymore and you'd be mad not to take it, because who wants to work anyway.  Unless of course you have a mortgage or are bad at your job and think that no-one else will give you money for being bad at work.)  Great, now I just sound like Ms Mole.  (Kylie Mole, from the Commedy Company, big hit show in the late eighties that I was allowed to stay up and watch even though it was a school night.)  (School is where you work and they don't pay you at all, but you learn a lot.  A School Night is betweeen Sunday and Thursday where you have school the next day.  It is also an excuse your parents give for not letting your friends stay over.  "No, not on a School Night," they'd say.  This meant that Friday night was the best night in the world.  Obviously you wouldn't have your friends over on Saturday night because then you would have to miss them between school and Saturday morning, plus there was Church on Sunday mornings....)  Anyway (where was I) ah, yes.  So I have been staying up late and getting up later.  I am beginning to have a little bit of sympathy for people who seem to become instantly nocturnal as soon as the weekend or any kind of holidays roll around.  Good for them.  Personally, I like seeing the sun and if we ever have some in Melbourne again, it would be just great.  At least Melbourne weather is currently better than Perth.  WE'RE not having hurricanes and unlike Adelaide, WE'RE not having floods.  I saw on the news that the drought was over.  Maybe I'll be able to wash the bugs off my car now.  Bugs on my car (quick explanation) - After being paid lots of money to leave my job a friend and I drove to Perth (we avoided the hurricanes and flooding, but it was a little cold sometimes.)  Perth is a LONG way away from Melbourne.  We drove 8626 km in twelve days and my little car collected lots of little bugs in the front of it.  Hopefully there are no dead roo remains around my wheels.  Ew.  (My friend and travelling companion on this epic journey, Jeanie (the Jeans), kindly removed the bird feathers from the grill after I ran into a bird.  RIP little birdy.)    Run over the birds and what do you get?  Flat birds!  So, now I'm doing a lot of nothing.  Which is great.  Not entirely accurate.  I have applied to do Honours in Philosophy (a bit of an about face from what my Computer Science degree got me) which will go for a year and live off the buckets of money they gave me not to work anymore.  Invention for the day: Coating similar to teflon on front of cars that facilitates very dead bugs being wiped off really easily rather than cooking on the front of your car and the number plate.

      Have achieved my goal of previous post of not starting entry with "well".  Well well, you might say.  Discovered today that the room where I type this stuff out has a heater in the wall.  Only discovered this because lovely boyfriend turned it on and I happened to stand near it while opening a door.  That, and the room was suspiciously warmer.  Invention for the day: Machine that beats all warmth related information out of residents of abodes (a manual solution is just not workable).

      I'm back in Melbourne.  I'm a student (I enrolled today) and I once again really do believe in Absolute Time.  I will have to go and read Stephen Hawkins again.  The conference was great.  Drove across to Adelaide on Sunday, stayed until Thursday lunch time, drove back.  Got home fairly late last night.  Today I re-arranged my bed room so that I could sit at my computer desk and create a "study friendly" environment.  When I got back from uni I re-arranged the lounge room too.  Invention for the day:  (I can't whistle) Something that attaches to your keys that you can call on your mobile and it will make a noise so you can find them.  I have lost my keys.

      I am all dressed up.  We (David, Bowie, Katie and I) are going to Jacques Reymonds (this flash restaurant).   I am sitting all dressed up with a little more time to go before I have to go to Bowie's to catch a taxi.  I have already thought of three things I would have done differently:  1. Worn loser skirt to accomodate food. 2. Don't like hair, needs more/less moose. 3. Some kind of hand jewellery (ring, bracelet) would look good.  Oh well.  Too late now (especially for my hair).  I reached new depths of nothingness today.  Sat around in the house until 4:00 in my dressing gown.  First I completed my game of Civilization (95%, more than 1500 points).  Then I watched the cricket on tv.  That was about it.  Oh, had deep and meaningful discussion about having to take off clothes with house mate (while cricket was on).  I mean why?  Why is it so difficult?  Why does it feel great to bum around the house in the jammies you've been wearing since three o'clock yesterday afternoon?    She cracked first, she had to go to uni before the book shop closed.  (Semester starts on Monday!!!)  Took a while to transform myself from tracky-dacked, flannel wearing couch sponge to fantastic society go-getter - but a bit of Australis lip stick and some flash tights can do anything.  (Especially combined with aforementioned tight skirt.)  Spending tonight at Bowie and Katie's.  I wonder where they live....  Invention for the day: Shower you can have without having to take off your clothes.  Sigh.

      Height: Hopefully the same as usual, but who can tell these days. Weight: Don't know, didn't think of it.  Was distracted by some deep thoughts that didn't concern the amount of matter I consist of. Pages of Nussbaum read: 20, plus some scanning to find a quote I was sure existed but failed to find.  Today I have not watched tv (yet).  I have discovered (re-discovered) Civilization.  It's a great game that fits on two floppy disks.  My highest score ever is 123% and I challenge you all to beat that.  Just so you have some hope, you need to be on King Level with 7 Civilizations.  Evil laughter.  I have not done a lot today and it can be summarised quite briefly:  Slept crap, up at 10:30 Played Civ until laptop crashed (was going quite well too) Had shower Read Nussbaum until finished chapter Went into uni and borrowed book (and re-borrowed Nussbaum).  Thanks to Hannah for initial borrowing of Nussbaum. Went to Dave's and updated blog  Who knows what the future holds.  You can't change it.  Saw this recently - in Adelaide at Philosophy Conference (from Prof J C C Smart)  "Think you can change the future, raise you left hand or your right hand". Raise a hand.  "Have you changed the future?  No, that's in the past."  I am becoming more and more convinced of presentism and relativism, for time.  But I don't know how this relates to space yet.  In case you are aliens (or not very philosophical) I will explain:   Presentism  is just that only the present exists.  So Napoleon doesn't exist, but he did and Prince Williams children don't exist (but they might). (As opposed to  Four-Dimensionalism , which is what Prof Smart is, I think.  That is just that space-time exists constantly in four dimensions - people argue about it because it tends to lend itself to a static universe (if the future exists you can't change it)).   Relativism  is just that thing that Einstein goes on about with trams and clocks and the speed of light.  (Time is relative to the observer).  (As opposed to  Absolutism  which is what Newton might have been and his little minion Clarke had big words with Leibniz.  Newton and Leibniz were having a fight about who had  priority  on calculus ( priority  is pretty much who published it first and therefore "discovered" it) but why they got so nasty about space is beyond me.   I reckon Newton was annoyed because of the Rise of the Apples*.  If he had called it something better than "method of fluxions" people might have taken him more seriously and students wouldn't be making fart jokes during his lectures.)  See  urlLink Newton vs Leibniz  Celebrity Death Match (not in clay).  *Rise of the Apples:  What happens to nasty vegetarians when the Civilization of the Apples began to fall (one fell onto Newton) and then the Apples took their revenge by rising against people who refused to eat meat.  Newton should have had his chair at Oxford placed somewhere other than the orchard and none of this would have happened.**  ** I think I'm drivelling.  Invention for the day: Drivel catcher.

      Ricki's topic: Transexuals Exposed Jerry's topic: Torrid tales of prostitution  Today I feel like crap.  Despite Melbourne's unaccountable sunny disposition, it was really hard to leave the house.  So I hope you all appreciate this.  I found the mysterious third volume control and now, once again, have music.  I don't know, I guess I am past the age of being able to program a VCR now.  But I never could anyway (not being that addicted to any particular show, I never found it necessary, besides, who isn't home at 6:00 to watch the Simpsons anyway?)  I had played with the volume on the operating system and the tape player, how was I to know the MP3 software had a control too?  No email regarding time table.  I am starting to sound like Adrian Mole going on about the giro, so I will stop complaining and just turn up on Monday.  I got a letter from Monash, I now owe about $1,500 for one semester (includes the option to pay up front HECS and the 25% discount.)  That's not too bad, I just hope I get value for money out of the amenities fee.    As an honours student I have the best library privledges (well, better than just being a normal undergrad).  I can borrow like 30 things, for four weeks and renew them up to six times (as long as no one else wants them)  That means you can borrow a book for the entire semester....    I am not sure that it's not just a bit scary that I'm excited by this.  All I have to do is get the real Honours Co-ordinator to sign a little slip to confirm that I really am an honours student.  (Every now and then technology slips and I am reduced to handing around bits of paper.  Why couldn't it just be on my student card?  Like my gym membership).  Today's tasks include such prestigious things as: Pick up boots from shoe repair people Take suits of illustrious boyfriend to dry cleaners  Wow, if I had kids I could be like a house wife or something.  Still pounding my brain through Nussbaum.  I am a terrible hair fiddler, (someone recently pointed out that the recognised me in a car because I was fiddling with my hair before they recognised the car...) and I have discovered that I read more effectively if I tie my hair back so that I don't fiddle with it and day dream instead of concentrating on the medical analogy of Lucretius poem or something.  (Fiddling includes general trwisting, putting up and platting.  I could cut it short (again) but I would still find a way.)  Invention for the day: Remote control the allows flicking through topics on Jerry Springer if current topic is boring.

      Weight:  According to the gym scales, about the same, but the guy took off three kilos for clothes. Height: According to the gym, I'm about the same (1.72m)  Aerobics was good last night.  Managed to squat sucessfully and hold for four (which was more like six by the time she started counting!!)  Stiff neck this morning.  Still no time table.  Went and saw Dirk, he wasn't aware that he was filling in for the guy who was filling in for the Honours Co-ordinator who was out somewhere for the week.  Dirk suggested I send an email to the guy filling in for the Honours Co-ordinator.  I have just sent my first Monash based email from my new Monash email address. Yay!  In the case of failure I am to turn up at 11:00 and classes are mostly Mondays and Thursdays.  I could cope with that kind of starting time.  I am annoyed because yesterday I could get the music to work on Dave's pc and now it just doesn't.  It says it's playing and nothing is coming out.  I checked volume (in two places), I checked the tape thing says "CD".  What more can there be?  Today I was walking through uni (feeling discouraged after failing to find out about time table) when I saw this poster  Are the educated less racist?  Or something like that.  I thought, oh, that sounds controversial, I could write about that on my blog.  Then I thought that it would come to do "what is racism" and "what makes us racist".  So I decided to take an Epicurean point of view.  Basically, Epicurus holds that desires/emotions that we have that are not natural and necessary (e.g. not eating, breathing) are based on false beliefs.  For example, we believe that fame is important because of false beliefs about what it is to be mortal.  We (they) believe that we should be good because otherwise the gods will punish us, but this fear of the gods is false (the gods don't give a rats what we do, because they're so perfect, how could little us affect them?)  So in the case of racism the false belief is that people of another race are going to do you harm.  (Now, this was probably just a bit true if you were an Athenian or a Roman....)    Now it has been observed (not just by watchers of sesame street) that children aren't racist.  Racism is something we learn.  So we learn to be afraid of other races, then we learn (through further education, I presume the askers of the question are postulating) that we learn that they're not that scary at all.  After all, most "educated" folks think that racism is based on ignorance.  It is possible to have be educated and ignorant though.  (Educated and elitist, if you are Plato or Aristotle - there philosophy wasn't for the farmers, women or slaves because they didn't have time.)  Anyway, no real point, just thought it was interesting.  Invention for the day: Telepathy that allows communication between members of a department and automatically generates (and sends out to students) a time table.

      Weekend Alcohol Units: Far too many and enough to make Alex proud.  (Mmmm, Black Russians.)  (WARNING Lists)  I woke up in a bit of a panic this morning.  (This may have been to do with the fact that I kept dreaming I was Hitler's daughter after watching that stupid miniseries on seven last night.  I won't be watching the conclusion because there are better things on tv plus I will be going to aerobics.)  I have decided that as there is less than a week until Semester starts, I'd better get my butt into gear.  Fast.  Made a list of what I want to achieve.  Have already crossed off several items and it's only lunch time Monday.  So far I have:  Made list (bonus item) Bought a computer chair (yes, it is purple.)  It has arms and swivvels and is adjustable and not bad for $125. Bought tea, milk, bread Found my car keys (they were in the bags from Adelaide which I should unpack) Handed in my boots (my fave books) to be repaired.  They'll be ready on Wednesday.  They need new heels (again.)  At present I am working on: Blog and check mail  I tried to: Look up time table  But it occurs to me that the philosophy deptartment will have its own time table and I should go check with them.  Unfortunately I am finding going to uni a bit of a pain and this is while there is free parking!  What am I going to do DURING semester when I will have to walk (coz I am not paying for parking - I can't justify it).  I am thinking I should ride my bike because it will be much quicker and it is all down hill (on the way back) but it does require things like:  Carrying helmet (doesn't fit neatly into bag) Tucking pants into socks to prevent greasing pants Helmet hair (less of an issue as my hair gets longer) Dealing with securing bike  My list also has things like: Read abstracts from Metaphysics book Read Nussbaum (she is an author who is writing about Epicurus and Lucretius).  Nussbaum has led me to only one conclusion so far: That being prolific is not a virtue. Fix bike seat (it's too low) and attach lights (which I took off to go on  urlLink Bicycle Victoria 's Great Vic Bike Ride so they wouldn't get nicked) but the problem is that my handle bars are too short to have all the neat stuff I want to put on them.  You know?  Two hand grips, one bell, one set of gear changers (one on each side, one spedometer, one light)  Invention for the day:  Computer chairs where the arms automatically contract when you swivvel them under your desk so they don't make your whole desk move and you don't knock over your "Cubicle Sweet Cubicle" sign.  Very important.

      Status: Same as Wednesday, execpt hair down. Different things read, too numerous to mention.   Semester 2, Week 1, Day 4.   Had classes today and didn't write in web blog (duh).  Walked to uni in rain and got satched, despite umbrella.  Discovered empirically that boots are not waterproof.  Had first seminar for Metaphysics with Dirk - it's going to be great.  (This morning read the introductory paper on substance.)  Went to FOME meeting.  The topic was "Discontinuities" - or specifically, "Discontinuities in SF/Fantasy that we find really annoying."  The young FOME members have no respect for the chair and it is a free for all.  Red Dwarf and Star Trek were mentioned a lot.  I said that "Brides of Christ" had lots of discontinuities because the nuns were so discreet.  They didn't understand....  Had most excellent meeting with supervisor, showed him bits of my bibliography as it stood.  He mentioned some other things that would be good to have/mention/use.  I told him some of my thoughts on Lucretius and Human Nature and Pleasure.  Dirk made appropriate encouraging remarks that indicating I was well on the way to forming a thesis topic.  Went back home (with Hannah in her car - got blister walking in wet boots), had some food, back to uni (with car as it was after 4:00 - free parking).  Got some journal articles, books and references.  Then went swimming with Josh.  Home and food, read some of some of the books and watched Angel.   Semester 2, Week 1, Day 5.   No classes today.  Spent this morning reading and then went to uni.  Slept in until about 9:10.  I woke up at about 4:30 and had trouble getting back to sleep, I was busy thinking about the bundle theory.  (The bundle theory is that all we are is a bundle of properties.  It always makes me think of a cat made of elastic bands, I don't know why.)  Photocopied large sections of a book, but only a chapter, so I figure it's still "fair dealing".  There are all these warning notices about photocopying and copyright and stuff around the photocopiers.  As if anyone is going to  profit  (in the financial sense) from Epicurean theories.   My card ran out of photocopy money, so I put $20 on it, safe in the knowledge that I would use it all!!!  This afternoon went to a staff seminar.  (We were encouraged in yesterdays class by Dirk to go).  Gillian Russell talked about "Analysity".  We spent a lot of time discussing "All bachelors are married men".  I just can't bring myself to care about epistemology (theory of knowledge).  I want to spend some time continuing to update my bibliography and then it should be ready (about a week early).  Dave reckons we are going to see his parents tonight, so that's another free meal.  No, it's cool, I like his parents.  Invention for the day: Overhead projector that you can adjust so that it doesn't have to sit on the desk in everyones way and bends light so that the text at the top isn't significantly larger than the text at the bottom.  (Stupid speed of light!)

      Neck: Fine.  Hair: Still wet, in a top knot.  Height, weight: No idea, presumably about the same.  Pages of Brown read: Don't know.  Completed chapter was reading yesterday. Pages of Nussbaum re-read: 52.  Entire chapter entitled "Beyond obsession and discuss" which is about Epicurean/Lucretian views on love, sex and marriage.  Ideas formed: A couple.  Nussbaum says that Lucretius fails to ask some questions at the end of the chapter.  I don't think that he fails to ask them because his theory means that they aren't necessary.  Kind of in the same way that we don't accuse Christians of failing to ask if Jesus was a good guy.   Semester 2, Week 2, Day 3.   Sigh, the universe was with me, right up until I tried to leave the house.  I knew it was raining.  I discovered that both of my umbrellas were in the car.  So I got in the car.  Once in the car it was very hard to get back out and walk to uni.  So I decided to drive to Dave's instead.  If I had had change, I would have driven and paid for parking.  Then I drove to Dave's.  When I got here I discovered that I had about a foot of my coat handing out of the car.  It was satched and dirty.  Then I got out, with an umbrella, and dropped my carpet bag (which is not water proof, nor made of carpet, but out of couch covering, but whoever heard of a couch bag?) on the wet road.  I don't think anything inside got wet though.  Bad news on the car front.  When Mum and I were in Adelaide, we bought some milk.  Anyway, we took it (and some cheese and the other left over food) in the car back with us to Melbourne.  I said to Mum when I dropped her off, "Have you got the milk and cheese?"  She said that she did.  I noticed this really odd smell in my car yesterday and on further inspection (under the drivers seat) was the milk.  Gross.  Glad it was in a bottle.  It has only leaked a little but it is incredibly rank.  Car still smells, suspect will have to wash it (again (washed previously after the "apple juice incident")).  The worst thing is, I feel really guilty about it.  Read in Dolly or Cleo or something years ago about revenge on nasty-evil-ex-boyfriends.  One of the suggestions was to place a carton of milk under the car seat.  I only feel guilty about it because that's the only revenge I can remember.  Stayed up late watching stinky  Buffy .  Ooh, boo hoo, they won't let her slay.  (Paraphrase of Romy and Michelle watching  Pretty Woman ).  Maybe it's just me, but it seems that more and more television is based on the fact that the audience is supposed to hate all of the characters.  Does this make us feel better about ourselves (watching people we hate stuff up their lives).  I sure hope Big Brother has some function.  It's only about the middle of the day, so I still have the entire afternoon to do stuff and have things happen to me.  Plans for this afternoon include:  Waiting until parking is free at uni and going to library and campus centre. Pick up a style guide for Bibliographies from Phil Dept. Compiling a bibliography (rough form) and begin to annotate (putting in comments about potential use of/summary of reading.)  Invention for the day: Something similar to the Coke Bubble in the 70s ads that allows walking to uni without getting wet in rain.

      Neck:  Bit better this morning.  After panadol and hot shower was quite tollerable.  Have not made appointment with physio.  Hair: Various.  Tied it back in a low pony tail which meant that the front bits (most of what's on top) kept escaping (especially at windy Monash).  Played a lot with said front bits.  Have now retied and combed hair to prevent mass recalcitrancy.  Pages of Nussbaum re-read: about 5.  Pages of Brown ( Lucretius on Love and Sex ) read: Lots and lots.  Quite proud.  Pages of Kant ( Critique of Judgement ) read: 8 (Sections 1-6 for Monday's class).  Understanding level, probably about 7/10.  Not bad for Kant.  Pages of The Cradle Argument (author forgotten, starts with B) read: About 8, until I discovered I was missing two.  Felt really embarrassed as knew I had returned the article to Dirk just beforehand.  Went up to see Dirk, discovered reason was missing pages is that Dirk was missing pages.  (Library's copy has gone missing).  Dirk is borrowing book from Melbourne.  (Cradle Argument is that children in the cradle can be seen as accurately reflecting what is human nature, or natural, before we get all corrupted by society - contrast this with Aristotle/Plato who think that only the educated philosopher is in a position to rise above our vices and see what is natural.)  Number of times I went up to the 9th floor of the Ming Wing: 5.  Once to get a book that wasn't there, once to return Dirk's article, once to borrow book off poor sick aesthetics teacher, once to return book, once to tell Dirk pages 122 and 123 of article are missing.  Number of morons in blue cars that do u-turns in front of me and make me doubt the Epicurean axiom that "death is nothing to us": Just one.   Semester 2, Week 1, Day 2.   Forgot to add list of thing to do in my diary and therefore didn't complete one of my tasks.  Damn.  Will collect CD from info desk tomorrow, if remember.  Some things change, some stay the same.  Changed: the library - everything is on the web.  Changed: the name of the "union building" -> "campus centre". Changed: the position of the pedestrian lights on Wellington Road.  Exactly the same: the horrid sausage smell in the "campus centre".  Exactly the same: the number of functional escalators up to the 9th floor of the Ming Wing.*  No classes today.  Went to the library and saw if my application for a private study coral was accepted.  Lo, it was.  Spent a few hours in a tiny room with a very dusty desk in the library reading (my semester's study coral).  It's good, there are no destractions and it's very private.  It contains a locker (so I can dump books in there, once I've borrowed them) two desks and a power point.  I guess I could put my laptop in there if I wanted to.  I can't see myself doing that because it is necessary to have food, sunshine and a chair that rotates to write a philosophy essay (in the same way that I found it necessary to have Skittles while writing C programs during summer semester).  The chair is particularly important because I like to spin while thinking.  Still thinking about my topic a lot (Dave's chair doesn't rotate, so I'm not thinking about it right now).  I have got a number of ideas, but they are fairly parellel and everytime I get an idea from something I've read, it seems to be in the next paragraph.  Not fair.  At least it might mean that I am understanding what I am reading.  One hopes.  I haven't quite gotten up to doing 8 hours of study a day, but as it's only day 2 I'm not worried.  I don't want my brain to pop by giving it too much all at once.  Today I got up before 8:00!!  I have to write an Annotated Bibliography for a hurdle assignment for my thesis.  The purpose of this assignment is to learn how to use the various library tools and think seriously (i.e. make a commitment to) an area of study.  Sigh, not due for another two weeks minus one day (Monday of week 3).  I haven't made much of a start yet, but I will tomorrow because I want to have something intelligent to say when I meet Dirk on Thursday.  Checked out the email that Dirk sent me yesterday from the search engine, people have really plowed into Nussbaum.  I almost feel sorry for her, but it would be based on a mistaken belief.  I'm sure.  * Number of Functional Escalators can be described as inversely proportional  ([1/m] * w * p * b )  m = number of minutes to the nearest o'clock (they break down when everyone wants to use them between classes) w = weeks into semester (they get worse towards exams) p = number of people on the escalators (chatty girls in platforms who don't walk down the escalators when they are moving count for 2) b = busy variable, contingent on such factors as hunger, meeting someone, catching a bus, having another class next or determination to beat your class mates to the reserve section in the library to be the first to photocopy that paper your lecturer just mentioned.  Invention for the day: Lifts that can tell if you want to go to the 7th floor or above or are disabled and will give you priority otherwise suggest in a nice voice that you take the disfunctional escalators.

      So much has happened - I shall summarize.  Jacques Reymonds was excellent, excellent, excellent!!!!  Food great, wine great.  I recommend it with all of my thumbs (as long as you have a spare $200.  I didn't and now I don't.  Which reminds me, should actually pay David back.  Big thanks to Mr Reymonds, the cute waiter and Bowie, Katie and G for a tanfastic evening).  Rest of weekend is a bit of a blur, it involved menial tasks (like picking up dry cleaning and buying groceries) with a whirl wind of alcohol and a slump of tv.   Semester 2, Week 1, Day 1.   My first day of school!  (Forgot play lunch).  Well, in the absence of a time table, I turned up and found Toby (Honours Co-ordinator) and got information from him.  It's all good, didn't miss anything.  I have classes on Mondays and Thursdays.  I also have some kind of "honours meeting" on Mondays and meeting with my (now official) supervisor on Thursdays, Dirk.  Organised to have excellent Honours Library Privledges put in place, went to classes, had lunch at Wholefoods with other lovely philosophy students.  They have all developed this haunted look and this odd twitch whenever the T word is mentioned.  I met a PhD student who I did first year Ancient Greek with today.  He has passed through the haunted stage to the insane laughter "Sure, my thesis was due six months ago, but that's okay" stage.  Scary.  I met with Dirk and paniced at him briefly in the "I like casually talked to you before I was accepted into honours and stuff, so are you my supervisor or what?" sense.  I told him about how I'd been reading Nussbaum and some of my ideas.  He showed me the Philosophy search engine for articles and book reviews in journals.  It's so cool, you can email it to yourself.  (Back before when I was in third year (four-five years ago) you had to write the references down and then discover that the library didn't have the journals that the stuff was in.  Very disheartening.)  So he emailed me some stuff.  I now have three emails in my Monash account.  (Yippy... not!)    I met an honours student who is doing something on Aristotle (with Dirk) and another one working with Epicurus (with Dirk).  No one is doing anything on Lucretius (who is not a mere disciple of Epicurus, though not as much as Aristotle is not a mere disciple of Plato.)  Lucretius forms some of his own stuff.  Apparently there's a bit of a theory going around at the moment (by AA Long or D Sedley, can't remember) that Lucretius only had access to Epicurus's work "On Nature".  Saw this in a Glossary of a book on Hellenistic Philosophy.  I will not name the book because it's too nasty, but it's cover is grey.  (They sort book by color, you know?)   Plato:  Student of Socrates.  Socrates:  Teacher of Plato.  Giggle.  Like that's informative.  I was suprised at how fast today went.  There was a bit when I was sitting in the seminar on "what is beauty" thinking it would never end, but the feeling passed quickly.  I am not sure what beauty is, but it seems to have very similar problems to meta-ethics.  (Subjectivity vs Objectivity and various accounts).  I wonder if aesthetics is actually meta-beauty.   I thought "meta" meant "with", but it seems to mean "after".  I think this may have something to do with the genative/dative case.  (Don't ask.)  I have been wearing my hair up to stop myself from twiddling with it, (like a twiddle bug) but I think it places pressure on my neck muscles.  By the end of today, my neck was so sore my brain hurt a lot and I had this throbbing in my eyebrow.  I have problems with my neck and shoulders (and back in general, really).  My neck muscles lock up and I get terrible headaches (sometimes they are so bad, I get really dizzy and want to throw up.)  This isn't good.  I think I shall have to put "go to physio" on my list.  (BTW, this is why I am not currently at aerobics.)  Maybe if I put my hair up, but not in a single pony tail, that wouldn't hurt.  I have decided to go against the tradition of my previous five years of uni and use my diary to keep track of what I should do.  (Once I used my diary as scrap paper to debug a red-black tree, but mostly I didn't use them).  I am beginning to see the point of lists that are written down, rather that purely mental.  It's not that I don't remember what's on them, it's the psychological satisfaction of crossing things off combined with some kind of feeling of accountability.  Maybe it's a hang over from work.  Invention for the day:  Pens that are attracted to the gravitational pull of my fingers in my bag.

      David's internet isn''t working today, so once again this blog is being written from Mel, Ben and Sascha's.  And a big thanks and Hi to them all.   Semester 2, Week 2, Day 3.   Today I got up about 8:45.  Hannah and I went into uni together and I parked at the Blackburn Rd car park.  Took the shuttle bus into uni.  I have never taken the shuttle bus before so this was a new experience for me.  It is still raining and the bus was crowded.  The driver was a popular guy today.  Spent most of today in the library.  Read this article on Lucretius by Kenney, (called  Lucretius ) which was about Lucretius and his context, poetry and stuff.  It was quite interesting, but not terribly philosophical.  I am trying to focus more on the philosophy of Lucretius than Epicurean doctrine or Lucretian use of hexameter.  (Woo hoo)  Also found Bailey's famous commentary on Lucretius text.  He goes through the tricky bits in Latin and commets on Lucretian intent.  However, as (I think) Nussbaum points out, he doesn't give the section on love and sex much attention.  But that's okay, more for the rest of us.  Borrowed a book on Latin.  It is by the same person who wrote the Ancient Greek one I used in first year.  Re-read one of the chapters from Annas today, after photocopying it.  I got a lot more out of reading it a second time round, I could underline the text and write bits.  I have even drawn up a matrix with beliefs/desires categorised with Natural vs Empty and Necessary vs Non-Necessary desires.  Then I have asked in big letters, "Where does Lobster go?".  It makes sense for me, anyway.  It was good - I feel much better about what's going on now.  Went back to corner and discussed the use of the definate article with our resident lingust, Olav.  (For aliens, (or non-grammarists) the definite article in English is "the" (as opposed to the indefinate article "a") and in other languages is things like "el" "los" "das" etc.  Latin doesn't have one.)  Then went home, had toasted sandwhiches, found out which episode of the Simpsons was on (Lisa needs braces, dental plan) and went to Dave's to find out the net wasn't working.  So, that was my day.  Classes tomorrow and meeting with supervisor.  David so kindly printed out my bibliography, so I will have something to show Dirk when I meet with him.  Invention for the day: Pocket size devise that allows the zapping of students to the other side of campus if they are on the computer you want to use and only bumming on the net and not doing any real work.... or even if they are.

      Haha, thought I wasn't going to have a chance to blog today, but I am at Mel, Ben and Sascha's (waiting for stinky  Buffy ) and they have the net!   Semester 2, Week 2, Day 2   Today I slept in until 10:00.  It was glorious.  Then I read an article on metaphysics and whether or not quantifiers or variables make up ontological commitment (don't ask me, I don't know what it means).  After that I pottered around and did things like put out rubish, dishes, clean bathroom.  Cleaning bathroom involved removing a disgusting 15cm long hair ball from the shower.  Ew.  As my hair gets longer, I seem to lose more and more of it.  Not fair.  I am only growing it because Dave and Jeanie says it looks good, plus growing is cheaper than cutting.  Then what - ah yes, Grocery Shopping.  Went to the Safeway in Springvale after I cracked the sads last time I was at Coles.  Coles intermittently sell a product that I require weekly and always stack crappy alternatives.  So I will go to Safeway from  now on -  until they annoy me too.  Read a fair bit of  The Morality of Happiness  by Julia Annas - but only the bits on Epicurus.  Most Hellenistic schools of philosophy have this thing that Happiness (in some form or another) is the ultimate ends of life (the meaning, goal, purpose etc).  This book explores Stoicism, Skeptics, Cynics (Classical Greek for 'dog' - as 'dog' is synonomous for a creature without shame), Aristotle and Plato (a bit).  Plato wasn't really into happiness the way that the other guys are.  Epicurus is after  ataraxia   - which, best I can fathom, is really a life 'without trouble' (untroubled).  Some people translate this as 'tranquility' - but apparently that has negative conotations in English, implies inactivity or something I guess.  Bummed around at home watching Simpsons and stuff.  Waited as late as possible to see all of the wedding on Neighbours (my secret shame, which I am really proud of).  Dee and Toady got married.  On the way to singing, found out on Nova that they went over a cliff.  Not surprised because apparently the chick who plays Dee is leaving anyway.  Toady needs more torture in his life at this point anyway....  Then went to singing.  Which was good.  We are getting ready for a concert in September.  Not all the sopranos turned up, so we couldn't change a light bulb.  (How many sopranos does it take to change a light bulb?  Four.  One to change it, one to kick the chair out from underneath her, one to say "I could have done it better" and one to say, "See?  I told you she couldn't get that high!")  Invention for the day: blankets that work off the coldness of your feet to make them warm.  It was 12 today and it will be 12 tomorrow too.  So windy....

      Well, I think I've finished by Bibliography.  I am going to Dave's eldest sisters place for dinner tonight.  She knows Latin.  If only I could transplant the knowledge she has into my brain.  Such a thing would be useful come exam time too.  I don't have exams in this course.  I have organised to pick up David at Syndal, so I thought I'd sit here a little longer.  It's freezing, I have the heater up high and I don't know how I am going to make it out of the house.  It is dark out there - and when I came in there was natural day light, but now I am going to have to feel my way to the front door and try to get out without banging anything over with my bag.  I have six books out on loan at the moment:  Lucretius and Epicurus (Clay) Hellenistic philosophers (Long and Sedley) Morality of happiness (Annas) Philosophia togata (Barnes and Griffin) Lucretius on love and sex (Brown) Therapy of desire (Nussbaum)  I see a rough theme...  I also have two keys for my study coral, but they're not due back until the end of October.  Brain aches.  Right, going to attempt to leave the house now!  Wish me luck.

      Weekend:  Friday night, went to Dave's parents place for dinner, was good.  Stayed up watching Rage and talking to Hannah and David.  Saturday, slept in and went to SCA dance practice.  Then back to Jeanie's for a cuppa tea and ironing and getting ready into garb.  Took an hour and a half to get ready, including ironing, finding garb and lacing in Jeanie.  Went to Ball for a few hours, was stuffed, went to Dave's house warming in garb, got changed, was still stuffed.  Drove Jeanie home and slept.  Sunday, didn't leave the house.  Read some metaphysics articles and then read a lot of Georgette Heyer.....  Brilliant!   Semester 2, Week 2, Day 1   Classes on Aesthetics today.  Starting to get into it, though initially it looked tedious.  Who really cares about what beauty is anyway.  Our poor seminar guy, he has been ill and he has just written a book on what beauty is.  He isn't happy with it....  so I don't think anyone really cares.  No afternoon class, no plan on finishing bibliography.  I was going to buy Kant's book,  Critique of Judgement .  I saw it in the bookshop and thought I should get it (there is only one copy at Monash).  But then I discovered it was $56.00!!!  Like, it's only a little book and I can't see myself using it that much.  Might see if I can borrow it through another library.  At this point I hope the text book industry dies - then maybe students could spend their money on better things.  I would even be happy to pay money every time I borrowed a book from the library and that went to the author or something.  But $56 for a little book that was written in 1790 and has no pictures I'm going to use for three weeks sucks!    It's damn windy today.  Dave's computer would be better if the space bar worked consistently.  (That's an example of a counter factual!)  I am currently listening to Michael Jackson's  Smooth Criminal .  I have no memory of hearing it before Alien Ant Farm did a cover (with the exception of my little brother singing "Eddie are you okay?" in the bathroom about 15 years ago).  Weird 80s keyboard vs boring bass guitar.  Need I say more?    Car smells less like sour milk.  Yay!  Invention for the day:  Photocopiers that can actually figure out which way round you stuck the book into the thing and therefore photocopy both pages and not half of one.

      Tranmission resumes to you today from Dave's place.  Apparently they had to spend an entire hour making the net work.  I don't know, these whacky people who work and are singularly incapable of finding an hour during the week to fix the net so I can use it.  They're only ripping themselves off, what, with their unlimited downloading I could have down loaded lots of illeagle stuff this week, but now, they'll never have as good value for money as they could have had.  But enough about that.  I think I am coming down with the cold that everyone else got last week.  Once again I am slow to get it.  My throat hurts, sniffle.  Today I started on the synopses. I have written about 1300 words.  Mostly about Soble's love papers and Annas's Rethinking what is Natural paper (in her  The Morality of Happiness  book).  Funnily enough, discovered on summarising their arguments that I didn't know what their arguments were.  Dave's keyboard is sticky.  Today I saw him for the first time since Tuesday (where I saw him come in, grab his stuff and leave.)  Must be love.  Also watched Collingwood get slaughtered by Brisbane.  Sigh.  The worst bit is that we've got Adelaide, Sydney and Essendon to go (in case you are aliens, or Jeanie, I will explain.  Collingwood is the team I like to see win for no rational reason.  Other people like to see other teams win for no better reasons.  Adelaide, Sydney and Essendon are playing quite well, so they might win instead of the team I want to win, Collingwood.  That is bad.  Not in the objective sense, in the subjective sense.  Some people mistakenly think that it's objective, but they are wrong.  Otherwise how do they explain that only about 1/16th of the population (assuming even distribution of fans) is right?  I know, they're unenlightened, really Collingwood is the best team for lots of rational reasons.)  Invention for the day:  Infallible referees.  Not that I'm complaining, but think of the applications!!  Not just with sport, but arguments with your boss, boyfriend, parents or children.  The only problem is you couldn't take them into philosophy seminars, circuit meltdown, you know?

      Once again at Mel, Sascha and Ben's place.   Semester 2, Week 3, Day 5.   Last day of week three.  Have I done any work?  It doesn't seem like it.  If I'd done work, I'd be closer to the end of my work, but it seems like I'm still just as far away.  I have to write to summary of the key papers in my area.  That means I have to read (more than once) the key papers in my area, plus write something about them....  At least it doesn't have to be critical!  Last night I re-read Fiona's paper and made more notes.  Today I read:  2.5 articles of Soble's  Philosophy of Sex and Love . About 15 pages of Nussbaum (again) Some Lucretius of various bits, including an entire re-read of what he wrote on love.  But, is this enough?  I take comfort in what I learnt yesterday.  My fellow students (who are finishing this semester) have their first draught of their thesis due in three weeks.  At least two of them haven't started writing it yet.  But I would freak out if I was in that scenario.  One of the guys wrote his two essays in the last four days of semester.  That just seems wrong.  I couldn't right 9000 decent words in four days, no matter how much pre-reading I have done.  Went to uni and photocopied the Nussbaum paper, so I can scribble on it.  I feel more accomplished in an article when it has bits underlined and I've scibbled comments in the margin.  I don't think it's right to mark up library books.    Invention for the day:  Library books you can mark up, but as they pop through the Return Shute, all the markings disappear.  Yeah!

      This post is brought to you via the kind heatedness of Mel, Sascha and Ben's internet connection.  May it always be near the start of the month (their net gets real slow after their quota for the month runs out).  I am actually blogging on a Thursday!  This hasn't happened since semester started.  (I am less annoyed with my hair since I have proved (empirically) that it is getting longer.  This was done by a while ago I took my hair at the top back point (the bit where it stops being the top of your head and starts being the back, you know, where most parts end) and noted that it came down to the little point at the back of my neck where the hair stops growing out of and now it goes beyond that point.  Yay.)   Semester 2, Week 3, Day 4.   Last night I went to bed early (because I was tired and there was no good tv) so this  morning I woke up at 5:30am.  I had these weird dreams about these two girls in a Roman Polanski Slasher B grade movie.  At one point, this girl slices the other one with her big sword thing (possibly directly out of Tuesday's  Buffy ) and so the one who is down attempts to cut her own head off with her own sword.  I thought this was gross and tasteless, so I decided to "switch channels" as I was watching tv.  Anyway, so I switch channels, but the grinding, sawing noise from the tv continues.  Gross as.  It was then that I decided to wake up.  Was awake for about an hour before I slept in until about 8:30.  Bliss.  Metaphysics class today.  We talked about David Lewis's 'possible worlds'.  He thinks that possible worlds are of the exact same nature as our world and that the only thing different about this world is that we live in it.  (He is a concretist (as opposed to someone who thinks that possible worlds exist as sets of sentences or something else ).  Only something like philosophy needs to terms like 'concrete' as we have destroyed words like 'real', 'exist' and 'actual'.  For Lewis, 'actual' is indexical and refers to the world that the speaker is in (like 'I' refers to me, i.e. the person speaking.))  Then was going to be all virtuous and do some reading, but my brain protested, so I went home, had a cuppa tea, tinkered around on the piano (I played "Two out of three ain't bad") and decided to come here.    The lady at number six (I live in some units) (who waters the garden for us) said that the lady at number one (who I've not met) was robbed yesterday.  This is not good.  I always thought that the lady at number six (and five) were around so often that our place was pretty safe.  But this might still be true, as it's a long and lonesome drive way to walk a VCR along.  But number one has its own drive and there are less people around.  Invention for the day: Security door that works like a garage door or car door with a remote control so when you are carrying eight bags of groceries, the mail and an umbrella you can still get into the house without putting anything down to get the keys out of your pocket and somehow lift four bags of shopping to the door knob, insert the key, wiggle it and make it into the house.

      Once again I come to you, live via the internet from the Arts Basement.  I was mentally composing things I wanted to say while I was getting ready to come here, I would have made a list, but I was in the shower at the time.   Semester 2, Week 3, Day 2.   Spent all day reading.  Re-read the Cradle Argument now that I have the key missing page. Read Fiona's paper that I got on Friday. Read the lecture notes on Kant for Aesthetics. Read next weeks Metaphysics paper (had to start from scratch after I fell asleep trying to read it on Sunday) Read about 50 pages of Diskin Clay's  Lucretius and Epicurus  - it is really good.  It talks about the relationship between the dead Greek guy who died two hundres years before the dead Roman guy and how you can prove the relationship and how Lucretius isn't an inconsistent whinger who just talks bollicks.  Then went to singing, (for the benefit of Melinda, Kellie, Hannah and Jeanie who did not grace us with their presents we sang Resonet, Love Changes Everything, Pastime, Sounds of Silence and Throw your Arms), came home, ate left over cake from Saturday's 50s party, watched Buffy (laughed at the crappy crappy interaction between Buff and Angel) and went to bed.   Semester 2, Week 3, Day 3.   Read about 120 pages of Diskin Clay's  Lucretius and Epicurus   Probably got another half a day of reading to go.  That's the advantage of books that have lots of appendices, indices and notes (and stuff in Greek).  Went shopping for groceries at Safeway* in Springvale again.  Had to put $1 in to get a trolley, had difficulty returning trolley as most of the trolleys in the trolley bay had the little key thing broken off the chain.  Overspent.  Not too worried as I bought things that will last several weeks, but are expensive (like shampoo, conditioner and stuff)  Decided that I really hate books where the notes are at the end, instead of at the bottom of the page (footnotes).  It really breaks up what you're reading.  Plus, with some books they are heavy and you can't just leave a finger in there all the time and flip back and forth easily.  What annoys me about footnotes is when the notes continue onto the next page.  What's the deal with that?  Why not just have less text and more note???  Now I've come into uni to blog.   Saw Sascha, Hannah, Olav and various young people I don't remember.  Gonna give Hannah a lift to her car seeing I parked cloes (as it's after 4:00).   Other things I wanted to mention.   *Dear Coles Myer,  I was once a loyal shopper to the Coles Myer chain.  I believed in Bi-Lo products, I would shop at Coles for the items you couldn't get at Bi-Lo, I would tell people that Sussans have the best flannel pj's.  But you have let me down.  First of all, (and this is my primary greivance) your decision to have Lisa McCune (or whoever she is) on your ads for Coles really, really annoys me.  All she does is go around making bean jokes and eating chocolate cake.  And she probably didn't even write the bean joke.  I mean, anyone who has one a gold logie (TV Week award thing) is just death when it comes to ads.  Look at Ray, look at Daryl!  Second of all, Market Day?  Why can I only buy cheap fresh fruit at Bi-Lo on Wednesdays?  Actually, this doesn't really bother me, because the selection of fruit and vegies at Bi-Lo is really crap.  And their bananas are always either green or brown.  What ever happened to yellow?  Plus, with Bi-Lo you've got that horrible Ian Hewittson, who has gone from eating crappy Bi-Lo food to advertising Jenny Craig, not such a good sponsor now, is he?  So I am shopping at Safeway.  At least they're not forming a league with the Devil!  (Shell - who apparently did something to someone in Africa that wasn't very nice).  I am sure I wanted to talk about something else, but I can't remember what it was.  Oh yeah, something to do with writing....  I got this info sheet off the honours co-ordinator that suggests that you write every day as part of good practice for your thesis.  Well, I hope this counts!  Invention for the day:  Shopping trolleys that read your intentions and return your dollar if you don't intend to remove them from the carpark.

      Still no net at G's.  I have managed to log into a computer in the bowels of the Ming Wing (the basement of the Menzies Building).  I tried to log in on Thursday in the library but it didn't work.  As I was walking in to the lab, just before, I saw a notice "Having trouble logging in?".  I thought, this looks like to poster for me.  Anyway, it was all good, I had to log in as Register and change my password and log in and now everything is sweet.  So, lets walk through what's been happening.   Semester 2, Week 2, Day 4.   Briefly, had Metaphysics class in the morning.  Went to a staff seminar on "Is Strength of Will Rational".  Caught up with supervisor and he recommended I read some CONTEMPORARY papers.  Tish and pish.  But then he gave me the references.  So now I have:  Philosophy of sex : contemporary readings  Philosophy of sex and love : an introduction  Anyone would think I was obessed.  Almost killed myself dragging all of the books I had with me around and to the library and everything.  Ended up hanging around MURP in Wholefoods, before dumping my bag, going and getting the car, driving to the Campus Centre (Union Building for the pre-94ers) and collecting my bag and books.  I have so much reading to do.  I chatted with someone (Fiona) who's into Epicurus and had written against Annas.  She agreed to give me a copy of her paper, as long as I agreed not to take it seriously.   Semester 2, Week 2, Day 5.   Ha, it would be nice to say I did work today.  But alas.  Spent the morning in the Salvos looking for clothes for Jeanie's 50s party.  Sigh.  Decided to base my costume on Rizzo from Grease, once found black shirt and bad red shoes.  Spent the afternoon in another staff seminar.  This one was about something to do with Epistemology, so it went over my head.  (Epistemology is the study of the theory of knowledge.  Anyone who does it for long enough tends to a) realise that they know nothing OR b) actually know nothing but think they know lots and write a whole heap of crap about it.)  In my mind, it is closely related to philosophy of language, which is also a big no no.  (Once again you fall into the a) or b) category, but in this case, more likely b)).  Got paper from Fiona.  Friday night, spent the night in front of the tv.  Have little recollection.   The Weekend   Got up about 9:00 Saturday, rang up Dad, got a recipe for Ginger Bread Men.  Went to Bilo (despite my anti-Coles tendencies, I was pretty sure that I could get what I wanted) and bought ingredients for GBM.  With the assistance of Hannah made GBM.  At first, we made ones that were about 6 inches in height (lying down GBM, obviously) but they proved to be too fragile and expand too much, and they broke after baking.  So I sacrificed those to Hannah's Dad (who had so helpfully proven empirically that 630 grams of flour is "almost precisely" 4 cups).  We genetically modified the little suckers to be about 3 inches in size and this was successful.  Went to Jeanie's 50s party.  Ate and drank far too much and had a golly good time.  (Found out later that Collingwood beat Geelong.  Yay! (Sorry to Alex and Sascha, you sad pack o' losers).)  Sunday, slept in lots, went to pick up car with David (left car at Jeanie's).  Came home, read about Concrete Possible Worlds, fell asleep, got up, had dinner, watched some program on ABC about Mary I and went to Dave's place.    Semester 2, Week 3, Day 1.   Got up, came home, sat around watching TODAY while having breakfast.  Went to uni, sat in classes on Aesthetics.  Went to lunch with honours group in Wholefoods, went back up to listen to the others give mini thesis presentations in preperation for their actual presentation in a couple of weeks.  Went and got a sandwhich and came here to blog.  Blogged.  That just about brings you up to date with my amazing life.  Invention for the day: Book reading familiar.  Something that will read and understand books for you and pass the knowledge into your head.  (I will not use any more familiars as my inventions, because last time I had this discussion, we ended up having a familiar for everything and we decided we'd never do anything again.  Well, I won't use familiars for a while, until it seems particularly purposeful.)  This is kind of like the belief monk, except that the reading familiar must be able to pass knowledge into my brain.

      Go Pies!  (Tonight they are playing Adelaide Crows.)  Delayed coverage in Melbourne on 9, starting at 8:30.  If you were in New York right now, chances are you couldn't read this.   A big Hi to all the blacked out.    You won't be watching Collingwood and Adelaide anyway, so why get so upset about having no power?

      Priorities:  Finish synopsis (due Monday Week 7) Prepare for FOME meeting (next Thursday (Week 5) I am running "Ainsley's secret meeting topic (trust me)". Prepare presentation for Metaphysics (due Thursday Week 7) Write Metaphysics essay (prepare and research) Write Aesthetics essage (prepare and research) Do course work reading Write Literature review for thesis (due Monday Week 13)  Not sure when the two essays are due in.  I have lost the ability to write critically.    I think this can be more accurately phrased as, I have lost confidence in what I write and I'm not sure that what I am doing is right or any good.  I just need to get over it.

      I have escaped to David's place where there is a heater in the same room as the computer.  Novel.  I have been really slack, but it's so cold and my brain, fingers and toes are freezing.  We got our electricity bill and it was heaps (like four dollars a day), so Hannah and I are just being cold at the moment.  (We don't have gas.)  But sitting at the computer in my scarf and blanket doesn't help my fingers and toes.   Semester 2, Week 4, Day 3.   Did a bit of free writing and wrote a bit of synopsis.  Went and did a brief bit of grocery shopping and had lunch with Jeanie (who did her ankle on Monday at aerobics.)  Hung around until about 4:00 and then went home and did more work.  Gave up when Neighbours came on.  Too cold.   Semester 2, Week 4, Day 4.   Went to Metaphysics class.  Not sure if I have no questions because I am so great or my understanding is so crap.  Went to the FOME meeting and made Trogdor the Burnitator out of purple play-dough.  It was "make your own moster (really)" day.  Came home and did some reading until I decided I was tired, so I had a snooze instead of working.    Dave came over and we went out for tea.   Semester 2, Week 4, Day 5.   Spent this morning with Mum and Dad, talking about life (mostly honours and dead Roman guys).  Mum is in hospital having something removed that they will then do tests on to see if it's cancer.  She is not very optimistic.  Spent a bit of time on my synopsis before being too cold to think.  I think I have sorted out Nussbaum (after about five attempts.)  I went to have another go at Brown but I couldn't concentrate so I left it.  My brain feels like slippery glass and nothing will stick to it.  Invention for the day: Electric heaters that are cheap to run.

      Thought I'd come over and see Sascha, Mel and Ben, but they're not here.  So I'm chatting with Lukas, who is here.  Yesterday I did something terrible.  I sat in korner and didn't leave for hours - I was talking to Polly about philosophy, that's like study, right?  Plus I played 500 instead of reading Kant.   Semester 2, Week 4, Day 2.   Books returned: 3 Books borrowed: 5  They are breeding like rabbits (next I'll borrow 8 books for sure!)  Tissues: Unknown.  Tissue box occasionally lifts when I pull out tissue, this is a bad sign. Back up tissue boxs: 1 Drugs taken: Dimatap Cold and Flu.  Yummmmm.  Today I started by doing free writing for ten minutes.  This felt really good.  Free writing (which I didn't explain yesterday) is where you write non-stop for some period of time, even if all you write is "I have nothing to write" over and over and it lets you get used to brain dumping in a non-critical way and is supposed to free your from the blank page phobia that people get.  I worked on my synopsis all morning, until about 2:00.  I went through Brown and tried to figure out what his arguments were.  I really only have Clay (whose book is long and I still have not finished) and tidy up Soble on Love.  But I haven't actually written anything that I could hand in, I've just gone through the papers and tried to figure out what their arguments are.  I have discovered that summarising a paper and summarising an argument (finding the little bastard) are quite different things.  Then I read some stuff for Metaphysics.  I read something against Lewis's Possible Worlds.  This guy thinks he has something that can do modal explanation without recourse to concrete possible worlds and that his theory does it better.  Then I read the articles I am supposed to present in Week 7 on Substance.  My brain balked big time at this.  I didn't understand a lot of it and I didn't understand the second paper's refutation.  I will re-read the introductory article and try again .... later.  Then I went into the library and found some sources from Brown that looked interesting, except they're from Classics journals, not Philsophy, so they might be a bit redundant.  Also found a source that Soble used.  I swear it wasn't there last week when I looked.  This guy is called Robert Brown too.  Confusing.  Ah, but the philosophy Robert Brown is actually Robert D Brown, so that makes everything better...  Hopefully my eye sight and left arm will remain intact after I exposed them to lots of flashy lights.  I guess this is just one of the many hazards of photocopying large bound journals from the 80s.  Why they decide to combine some random years together is beyond me.  Still feeling a bit crap, but I shall go to singing.  We are performing in September and I don't want to miss any rehersals (not because I'm not familiar with what we're doing, but because I fear our wonderful choir mistress with all of my evenly dispersed throughout my body, made of tiny spherical atoms, Lucretian soul!!)  Invention for the day:  Anti-virotics.

      Back in the Arts Basement.  Despite my belief that they won't work, I am taking echinacia (or whatever) it is.  It seems to be working, but then, who knows how bad the cold would have been, if I wasn't taking it.  (Damn counterfactuals!)  Yesterday I slept in a fair bit.  Sat around watching sport on tv trying to figure out why Collingwood lost, did a bit of synopses writing (finished Annas, moved onto Nussbaum), went shopping (a minor shop) for milk and essentials, watched crap tv and went to bed.   Semester 2, Week 4, Day 1.   Books read: None. Words written: Only these ones. Tissues gone through: Unknown, emptied pockets of coat into bin at lunch time. Nose: Probably bright pink and shiny.  Have resolved not to look. Ears infected from wearing bodgey earrings on Thursday thinking that they wouldn't get infected this time: 2.  I was going to get up, read the bit of Kant I was supposed to read on Sunday and then go to my class.  Instead I slept in, had breaky and shower, went to uni and played 500 for an hour and then went to my class.  I asked my philosophers had to make things so unclear, like, not just Ancient guys who wrote in a language that is difficult to translate and fairly moth eaten (or had volcanoes fall on the text in some cases) but like recent guys too.  He asked me why I thought it was, I said it was so they got paid more.  I was right.  How depressing.  Had a mini-meeting with the honours co-ordinator (Toby, he's quite nice) and he gave me this paper on Free Writing, which is supposed to be really good and helps you to losen up and stop being afraid of writing or the "blank page".  I think Daisy from  Spaced  could benefit from this.  I bought these floppy disks to get some things I sent to myself so I can use them at home, but the pc I logged into has a bodgey floppy drive, so I shall have to switch.  Not fair.  Also they are closing my favourite exit out of the Blackburn car park so they can build their stinky Synchrotron.  I know Dave is excited, but now I am going to have to do a right hand turn across Wellington Road instead of a left hand turn into Blackburn Road.  I thought something was weird because the shuttle bus didn't go out that exit the way it usually did.  Not fair.  Even though I have quite a little car, I still don't like having to sit in the middle of the road waiting with potentially my butt or nose hanging out into on-coming traffic.  Next I think I shall go home.  I am not going to aerobics.  I may watch tv.  I hope to read the paper for Thursdays class and the Free Writing paper (oh, and the example of a good synopsis before I waste any more time on it.)  Invention for the day: Some kind of dentist tool, especially adapted to remove non-floppy disk like things from floppy disk drives.

      It's Josh's birthday party!  While people are sitting and chatting, I am being anti-social and writing in my blog.   Does this mean I have moved to the dark side?   Semester 2, Week 5, Day 5.   Slept in after staying at Stongehenge until after midnight.  Dropped off some film for Dave to be developed.  Worked on my synopsis for about an hour and a half and then read next week's Metaphysics readings.  They were about unstructured universals.   Saturday.   Today.  Haha!  Went to the dentist for the first time in a long, long time (years).  Had two x-days.  Going back in a fort-night for a clean.  Nothing seems to be wrong, may have wisdom tooth out.  Sat around thinking I should read Brown, but instead watched  Sliding Doors  and  Back to the Future III .  Got ready and came to party.  Invention for the day: Eye brow pencils that are self sharpening.

       Thesis/Honours Update   I think things are going well.  In my meeting with Dirk, he said I could put some "scope justification" paragraphs around the arguments that I summarise in my synopsis, so this makes me feel better.    I have not done a lot for my course work subjects.  I do (most) of the reading for Metaphysics and have given up a bit on reading Kant for Aesthetics, but I am worried about writing essays for them.  Both of them require 4500 word essay around Week 13, but I am not sure exactly when they are due.  The Synsopis is due Monday, Week 7 and the other thing I have to do is a Literature Review, due Monday Week 13.  There is a week break towards the end of all this and I think that the coursework subjects only have 9 classes or so.  So it's still pretty good.  Under control.  I think Dirk is pretty impressed with the effort I've been putting into the thesis, but I keep jumping ahead, like, trying to get a topic and outline together when I should just be looking at what they are saying in the papers about Lucretius.  I canna help it!  Must learn how to walk before can run.... grasshopper!  I hope to spend tomorrow re-gigging my synopsis, then I can concentrate on Metaphysics, because I think I can knock over an essay there easier, plus I have a presentation in Week 7.  The only other immediate thing I have to do is re-read Brown's  Lucretius on Love and Sex   (just the juicy bits) because Dirk and I are meeting Tuesday at 10:00 to discuss.  He hasn't read it before.  Dirk hasn't done a lot with Lucretius, but I think he is just ace (Lucretius, that is.  Dirk is cool too.  The man knows way too much about dead Greek guys than can possibly be healthy.)  I am starting to feel a bit stressed, but it is under control.  It's certainly achievable.

      This transmission is from Stonehenge - the household of Melinda, Ben and Sascha.   Semester 2, Week 5, Day 2.   I didn't do any work.  Went to uni and met Dirk.  Photocopied sections of various books for him.  He and I are going to read stuff together.  Spent the day with Jeanie, after I did some shopping for her, and her knee.  Took Jeanie to singing.  Went home after singing and started preparing for the FOME meeting.   Semester 2, Week 5, Day 3.   Got up at about 8:30.  Read for four hours about properties, universals, fundamental measurements and went mad!!!  Finished preparing for FOME meeting.  I have been advertising it as "Ainsley's surprise topic (trust me)".  Went to the library with Dave and finally got the article from DocDel (the document delivery service) that is a "pugnacious attack against Nussbaum".  Went grocery shopping.  Then Hannah had her mum over for tea, so we helped tidy and had dinner with her.   Semester 2, Week 5, Day 4.   Got up early and walked to uni.  Read the article against Nussbaum, it was pretty pugnacious, but more against Seneca's (a stinky Stoic) view of love.  Sigh.  Weeks of waiting and it wasn't very useful.  Went and had my brain boggled by the Metaphysics class about properties, universals and watched others share the madness!  Ran the FOME meeting.  My topic was Time Travel (in Science Fiction).  I think it went pretty well, and I got a small stuffed blue elephant for my efforts.  I talked about presentism and four dimensionalism and Back to the Future I and Terminator I (a lot).  Bummed around korner for an hour and a half playing 500.  Went and saw Dirk and discussed Nussbaum and Annas with him.  (He had to put my meeting back, as he spent most of last night being boggled by universals, properties and stuff.)  It was dissapointing that he didn't have all the answers, but that's okay.  I have just gotten back from the Nott (the local pub).  Had a cheap meal and a drink with Bowie, Katie, Mel, Sascha, Ben, David and Polly.  Invention for the day: Dunno.  Something that thinks of inventions for the day.

      Oh, haven't written since Friday.  I shall be brief.   The Weekend.   Pies won!  By a lot.  (108 -71)  They are now third on the ladder.  Saturday: Finished "Faro's daughter" (not fossfy* related at all), worked on synopsis (for a bit anyway), went to Jennie and Liam's party.  Partied hard and hurt leg (recurring knee problem)  Sunday: Was going to go cycling, but windy.  Drove around with David, had yummy eggs for brunch.  Visited lame Jeanie (knee surgery).  Drove around some more.  Went to Dave's parents place for dinner.  Home, bed.  Horrible nightmares last night.  My first thesis related dreams.  (I'm so proud).  First I dreamt that I was thirsty, I kept having all these glasses of cordial and still be thirsty.  This is odd because Lucretius actually talks about the thirsty man who dreams about drinking.  I figure I was thirsty from the red wine.  (For some reason a bowling alley is in this section of my dreams).  The next part of my dream was I was reading Brown's book ( Lucretius on Love and Sex ) and someone had gone through and high lighted all the bits I needed, and put blue stars next to all the points and gone over the Latin in pen (because the book was a bound photocopy.  Weird.   Semester 2, Week 5, Day 1.   Got a lift into uni from David (thanks Dave!).  Had to convince Mouse (a chick in korner) that it was Week 5.  She has now gone away to do her assignment.  I learnt how to borrow from the Departmental Library.  I borrowed another book by Nussbaum called  Love's Knowledge , thinking it would be appropriate.  Unfortunately it seems to be solely related to how Literature and Philosophy interact.  Sigh.  She also compares Lucretius with Nietzsche.  Please don't be put off by that.  Lucretius is actually really quite cool.  Went through Kant in aesthetics at a cracking pace.  I read the lecture notes two weeks ago and don't think I'm getting anything out of reading Kant, so I have stopped reading him.  I am hoping that I can do my essay on something else.  Someone who is translated into readable English would be nice.  During the class someone asked me about what texts I was doing my synopsis on and I rattled out five.  Turns out they did three, which makes more sense.  It's only 3000 words and I have been desperately trying to get stuff into 600 words (and that's no easy task when it's a book) instead of 1000.  Nuffy.  Then had lunch with honours folk at Wholefoods.  Their food was a little cold, but that's okay.  At least I got a piece of nice garlic bread this week.  Last week they were between batches or they'd run out, and I got two bits of normal bread with some garlicish like substance.  This week, it was bone fide garlic bread with the little crunchy bits that get stuck between your teeth and everything.  Then went to the library (borrowed two books on love) and complained about not having received my document from DocDel.  They have re-submitted my request as urgent.  Though why it is urgent because I complained is beyond me.  Anyway, the guy, who was nice, told me not to leave it so long and I should check after two weeks.  But I thought that was the lower limit, not the upper limit of the amount of time it would take.  I just didn't want to be pushy because they seem so harrassed.  Oh well.  After that had super meeting with supervisor (Dirk).  I asked him how many papers I was supposed to be looking at for the synopsis and he said he didn't know.  Ah!  I rambled on for a bit and got all excited about my theories and stuff.  He said I was way ahead of him (I burbled too quickly perhaps), so I am going to drop some stuff off for him to read tomorrow with some questions (that I will email) and we are going to go over it on Thursday afternoon.  After the FOME meeting, which I am running!  Ah!  So, compose email about questions and prepare for FOME meeting.  Also go to aerobics.  Not that Jeanie will be there....  :)  *fossfy = philosophy, when you've had either a) too much alcohol or b) too little sleep.  See also nish ning (air conditioning).  (Note, there is nothing to see.)  Invention for the day: Small robot that is able to retrive umbrellas from cars and return them to the house.  Some kind of robot that can read quickly and do text searching of paper books would be nice too and can hold open a book and flick to the notes and the end and back real quick would be handy.

      I'm at uni.  I have a terrible headache and am tempted to try to catch a bus home.  Clayton is so windy and I swear it isn't 18 degrees.  Just returned four books that have been sitting on my floor for three weeks that I concluded I wasn't going to read.  Just borrowed another book....  Private life of the Romans  by Mary Johnston.  It's only little, so that's okay.  I wanted something for Rome that I had for Athens in  Greek popular morality in the time of Plato and Aristotle  by K. Dover.   Semester 2, Week 6, Day 5.   I went and saw Dirk (my supervisor) this morning and we chatted about Alan Soble's book on the Varieties and Features of love.  He hadn't read it and when I walked in he was looking pretty chuffed.  He and I are pretty excited about my thesis at the moment.  There is a lot of opportunity to contemporised Lucretius and his stance on the types of love into some of the questions that Soble is writing about.  (His book was published in 1998 - you don't get much more contemporary than that.)  We discussed an approach to take for the synopsis that doesn't involve summarising the paper and how to tease out some of the issues, rather than Soble's arguments (points of view).  Also, more good news, he read my draft synopsis and has made a couple of suggestions and marked up some errors.  He thought it was pretty great and he liked the stuff I wrote on Annas.  I said good, seeing I'd spent so much time on it.  He asked if I thought it was getting easier.  I replied that I wasn't sure, because I worked on them in parellel.  Now all I have to do is go home, finish synopsis, have my nearest and dearest proof read it and it's all good.  (Oh yeah, at some point I should print it out and hand it in..... but that should be trivial).  Then I can start looking at the papers for my Metaphysics presentation on Thursday.  Sigh.  I expect I shall have a better weekend than those poor creatures finishing their draft theses to hand in on Monday.  Some of the supervisors were asking for draft drafts to have a look at before they were handed in.  Makes sense really, the rough draft is worth three times as much as my piddly little synopsis.  Invention for the day: A library catalogue system that is better than the stinky winky Dewey Decimal System!  I had to look up something that was 306.70938 H 195 B and that's just silly!  (Took ages to find it too.)  Maybe we should sort by colour.

      No speakers here either - coming to you from stress central, the bowels of the Ming Wing.  If I turn around about 150 degrees, I can see Rosemary, stressed out about Aristotle.  Ew!  Sucessfullly managed to extract gravel from the garage.  My hand was funny feeling for ages afterwards, as I had to scoop it out of the tank and into some fish buckets.  (Fish buckets are typically blue (or grue*) and have never had detergent or other chemicals used on them, consequentially they tend to have two bits of gravel and some dried weed at the bottom).  *Grue is a made up example of a complex property.  It is of green objects that will turn blue at some future date.  Also went shopping at Mt Waverley Safeway for some essentials (milk, crumpets, UHT milk for next time I can't be bothered....)  After a while, we (my family) started to pronouce UHT as "yut" - so we'd talk about "yut milk" - which some people think is descriptive of the taste, or of someone vomitting.  Personally, I don't mind it.  Seeing my main applications of milk seem to involve tea or milo, it's never unadulterated enough for me to care.  I don't even care if it tastes like real milk!   Semester 2, Week 6, Day 4.   I woke up at about 5:00 and couldn't get back to sleep.  I have decided to decline coffee at 3:00 in the afternoon from now on.  The worst bit was that I kept on thinking about possible worlds and necessity and stuff.  Yuck!  I blame Lewis.  Got up later than I wanted to after sleeping in when I managed to get back to sleep.  Bumma.  So I thought, Yeah, 17 degrees.  That'll be nice.  Walked to uni and had my Metaphysics class.  Today we talked about structured universals.  I almost understood today's papers.  Here goes:  Universals are things that are wholley present where instantiated.  We might talk about the universal banana as being the thing that makes in "banana like".  (See also Plato's forms for a theory of universals).  Now, some people think it is pretty silly to have things like "the Universal Ainsley" or "the universal banana" and they like to have something more along the lines of some primitive, like carbon, charge, quarks, charm or some basic (fundamental) things that are universal.  Structured Universals are made up of these basic universals.  E.g. (as Lewis uses it) Methane is made up of the universals Carbon and Hydrogen.  But he reckons Structured Universals are in big trouble because there are four Hydrogen atoms in Methane and how can you have four whollley present particulars in a universal.  It's a bit silly really.  The funny thing was that the rebuttal paper was written by one John Bigelow, who was sitting in the class with us, trying to make sense of what he wrote in 1983.  I know the kind of stuff I was turning out in 1983 (I was in prep, it went along the lines of "Spot is a dog") so I can sympathise there.  I started looking up journal articles so that I can start writing essays on my course work subjects (with I have been neglecting).  4500 words is just a bit third year essay really.  I hope.  I wonder what a third year essay is like, I haven't written one since 1998.  Invention for the day: Small disk that carries journal references and call numbers that can be inserted into the brain so that I neither have to print nor write down journal references and call numbers.  That'd be nice.  Maybe I need a palm pilot or something, nah, that's still counts as writing....

      Dave's place again.  Still no speakers.  I forgot to mention yesterday that I borrowed two more books (apparently I now have 19 items on loan... I wonder what they are!):  Greek popular morality in the time of Plato and Aristotle,  K. J. Dover. Greek homosexuality,  K. J. Dover.  The one on homosexuality has got all these black and white pictures of Greek potter with very revealing paintings on them.  Giggle.  Some of them are VERY generous.   Semester 2, Week 6, Day 3.   Despite yesterday's protests, I read pretty much all today.  Although I did sleep in until 10:00.  (I stayed up late, watching Futurama on tv.)  I read a fair bit of  Greek Popular Morality  and the introduction of  Greek homosexuality  (plus flicking through the revealing pictures some more).  Then I read another chapter on Soble, starting at the last section and working forwards, but not the section I was supposed to read.  Finally, I read the section on Soble I was supposed to read yesterday for my synopsis and then wrote down some notes and I think it makes sense this time.  Then I came here.  I am about to go home, grab some fish gravel for Jeanie and her SCA stuff that's been in my room for ages (a month) and take it to her place and have a cup of TEA!  The fish gravel bit could be an adventure, I wonder what the garage is like....  Invention for the day: Small robot that can gather, sort, wash, dry and put away clothes.  Especially clothes that are not dirty, but aren't clean either and remain on your floor until they get worn again, get put away or become sufficiently dirty to wash (usually by me stepping on them enough).

      I'm at Dave's place and his speakers for the computer aren't even here, so I decided not to bother trying to get music going.  At least he has a heater.  After I wrote yesterday, I went home and re-read Brown and worked a little on my synopsis.  Then food, aerobics, more food, bed.   Semester 2, Week 6, Day 2.   Got up at 8:00 and walked into uni (which takes about 25 minutes).  Chatted to Dirk about Brown and Nussbaum.  I think he is feeling a bit guilty that he's as lost as I am.  He keeps saying that if he was a good supervisor he'd be suggesting all this stuff to read and suggesting questions to ask to base my thesis on.  That he doesn't recommend things to read is okay, because I am so over reading.  I never want to read again.  I have so much reading to do.  Met Dave at uni and went and had lunch with him.  Went home and worked on my synopsis for like almost an hour and a half before giving up.  I am sending it to Dirk to read so he can comment and I can edit.  I should have done this two weeks ago.  I read it this time and it didn't seem so bad.  Eek!  It's supposed to be 3000, it's 4400 and I think I've got to add about 250 for it to be complete....  I used to be so precise in what I wrote.  I think I may have read more than I can summarise (bitten off more than I can chew).  Now I'm here typing this.  I am going to send off my email to Dirk with my draft.  The last paper (of 5) isn't finished yet and has big "Under Construction" warnings around it.  I meant to do it today/tomorrow.  But I have to re-read one of the chapters in Soble (about 30 pages) and... and... and I just can't.  Okay?  So instead I am going to trawl through the database for any journal articles on Lucretius and love.  Main problem is that there is lots of Classical works on Lucretius and love (like Brown, really he's a classical scholar... anyone with that kind of knowledge of Latin must be) but not many philosophical works.  Which could be good, means I can write about stuff without treading over trodden ground.  To write boldly where no philosopher has written before.  I don't mind writing.  It's better than reading.  Only problem is that if I find journal articles I might have to read them.  It's my brain, it's full.  Overflowing.   Pop !  (Or should that be  splat ?)  Invention for the day: Brain Decanter Tupperware or Super Brain Backup (allows you to dump useless stored information like advertising jingles and Seinfeld episodes into some kind of archive - thus freeing your brain and making it hungry for more knowledge and happy to read, read, read).

      Coming to you once again from the bowels of the Ming Wing.  After moving to a pc where the mouse works, I am please to say that things are progressing well.   Sunday.   I woke up at Dave's place after a fantastic party.  It was fun.  I said some stupid things but that's okay.  After helping Dave and Josh clean up after the party, we went and got breakfast from the Turtle Bean cafe, then back to my place for a shower and change of clothes (I had borrowed some clothes from Dave, as all I had to wear was party clothes.)  Went and visited my parents then visited Dave's parents and had dinner with them.   Semester 2, Week 6, Day 1.   One week until my synopsis and everyone else's thesis is due.....  Read a bit of Brown for my meeting with Dirk tomorrow.  Will go home and read more after this.  Walked to uni between showers and had Aesthetics class.    Learnt about Kant's sublime (the pain you feel when the imagination cannot grasp what is being thought of in a visual conception although the understand seems to grock it okay) and how it contrasts to beauty (the pleasure you feel when the imagination and understanding work in harmony though they fail to place what is being perceived into a concept, though the imagination keeps searching for one.)  Had philosophy Honours lunch in Wholefoods.  Started talking with Toby about Leibniz and Newton.  Toby was saying that we lived in a world with relative space (curved space) but it was possible to have a world with absolute space (euclidean/flat space).  I said that they were talking about different things.  I think they are confusing the fish tank with the water.  For Newton, a universe has to have a fish tank.    For Leibniz, a universe has to have water and fish.    So when Leibniz goes on about "God couldn't have created the world three feet over" he is imagining the fish and his rock in just any old where.    Newton's like, well, the fish and the rock would be at the left of the tank or the right of the tank (in a four foot tank).    Leibniz is like, okay, for the sake of argument, there's a tank.  Right, but see how I can take this bit of water and move it to the other side of the tank?  Newton's like, well yeah, you've moved the water.  But what I am talking about is two bits of space in tank, like that bit that's six inches in from the side and four inches from the bottom.  That bit of space can't move, even if you take the bit of water that was there and move it.    Leibniz is like, nah mate.  You've gotta move water, you can't reference things from the fish tank.  There is no tank.  Newton's like, but didn't you say that there was a tank?  See how stupid it was?  Invention for the day:  The Weather Service, more efficient that the Postal Service and clothes line sensitive (the washing I did on Friday looked mighty sad when I saw it on the line this morning.)

      Woah, haven't written for a while.  Today I am in the Library at uni.  I have just beaten my brain against some more of David Lewis's articles.  Sigh.  Someone has just put a re-call on the book I borrowed by Lewis.  It's mine!!!! I borrowed it first!!!!!  Now it's due in 5 days.  I wonder if I can put a re-call notice on the other copy?  I might have to read it now, rather than just feel smug about it being in my collection on the floor (which is litterally a foot high).   Semester 2, Week 7, Day 3.   Spent the day procrastinating and eventually prepared for my presentation.   Semester 2, Week 7, Day 4.   Had metaphysics presentation.  I was either a) really funny or b) a complete loser.  I made jokes all the way through.  It was on bare particulars, so I took in a teddy bear and his jumper.  The first presentation was on "Bare Particulars" so I took off his jumper, then it was "Particulars Re-Clothed" so I put his jumper back on.  About three minutes into my first presentation, John Bigelow (I think he's way up there in the department) says "Oh, I get it.  Not only have you taken off his clothes, but you've mispelt 'bare'".  Sigh.  As you can see, we're a bright lot.  Rode from my place, to Jells Park and then to Dandenong with David.   Semester 2, Week 7, Day 5.   Started reading to write Metaphysics Essay (4500 words).   Saturday.   Went to the dentist, had my teeth cleaned.  Very non-traumatic.  No fillings or anything (still).  I am so great.    Then went grocery shopping (at Bi-Lo, couldn't be bothered driving far) and came here (library).  Invention for the day: Extra arm and hand with about 20 fingers that will keep tabs of all the pages you want in those heavy books that just won't stay open by themselves.  A book duplicator would also be handy (yes I know we have photocopiers, but they're not the same).

      Stayed up late yesterday watching  Simone D Whasisface's Babies  on ABC.  Very scary.  I've only seen to episodes.  The basic thing is that these thirty something year olds are trying to get pregnant after they went to some conference or something.  Anyway, one hunts down her ex from her teen years, one is pregnant to her ex, but didn't realise at the time and the other one is trying to get knocked up by her subordinate at work (with a turkey baster at first....)  I wish that if I had maternal instincts they kick in in the next few years.  I don't want to be thirty something and desperately clucky.  Who wants to go to your kids twenty first when you're in your fifties?  Some of the people I know who are in their thirties are breeding.  It just takes so long to get established and sorting yourself out as a person that you seem to end up in your thirties before you even know it.  If only I could know now if I will want kids in the future and try and short circuit that (either by having kids or making myself not want to have kids.)  I don't really have a point.     Semester 2, Week 7, Day 2.   Spent this morning reading articles for my presentation for Metaphysics on Thursday.  It's about the Bundle Theory vs Substratum Theory.  Sigh.  (From Week 1, Day 5 "The bundle theory is that all we are is a bundle of properties. It always makes me think of a cat made of elastic bands, I don't know why.")  So the Bundle Theory is like, we're just a bunch of properties, dude.    The Substratum Theorists are like, but dude, how can we just be a bunch of properties?  What if there are two bunches of properties that are the same?  There must be something else that makes them different.  Yeah.  Let's call that something a "bare particular" (which reminds me of a naked bear...) dude.  The Bundle guys are like - Don't think so.  You can't go around just positting new things like that.  The Substratum guys counter going - 'Fraid so.  Otherwise you'll be going with the Identity of Indescernables, which is what Leibniz reckoned.  And everyone knows that Leibniz is wrong, wrong, wrong.  The Bundle guys wriggle around a bit and eventually go - Yeah?  Well, actually what we meant was that it is impossible for two bundles of properties to be the same so ner.  The Substratum guys then come up with this example of a world that has two same things in it.  (Like two spheres, two disks, two twins)  They then have it out over whether or not they have all their "relevant" properties in common.  Very silly.  So anyway, that is kinda what my presentation is about.  Dude.  Singing tonight.  Invention for the day: A dish that cleans itself after use and beer bottles that, once emptied, are drawn to the recycling bin.

      I don't really think I did that much yesterday.  Saw Adelaide loose to Port and went through my synopsis with Dave for a final polish.  I have printed it and it is all ready to hand in.  Yay!   Semester 2, Week 7, Day 1.   After I handed in my synopsis, I went to Aesthetics.  We talked about Plotinus' theory of beauty.  Unlike Kant, Plotinus thinks that physical beauty is less than "mental beauty" and that we find things beautiful because they remind us of the divine one from which we all come.  Next week we will do someone (Schiller) who is supposed to be like Kant and Plotinus' love child.  Cool.  Went home, watched Passions.  Read a bit of Plato's  Symposium  - up to the part where Aristophanes gives his rolly polly theory of love.  (That we were once combined with another person until Zeus split us in two.)  Watched tv.  Went to aerobics.  Thanks to Lynne, for turning up.  The rest of you are pikers... I know you're reading this.  Invention for the day: A little indicator on staplers that give the probability of the stable sucessfully managing to go through all 18 pages of your work and therefore allowing you to decide whether or not to abort your intention to staple.

      Last day of Winter, and looking outside, I hold little hope for the future.  Melbourne has been really windy lately.  So windy that it has starred in numerous news bulletins as a blower over of trees and a destroyer of houses and cars.  Wow.  Usually it's seen as one of the most inert of the four elements too.  My friend, who I have mentioned several times, Jeanie has a blog, but you'll never find it.  On the 10th of August she said "Well, apparently friends don't need to speak to each other any more. THey just read each other's blogs and then you know all there is to know."  I'd just like to say that even though I do detail here what I am doing, I do do other things too.  Like watch the Simpsons.  So if you're one of my friends reading this, you can still talk to me.  My social group has is going through a blog explosion.  There are blogs everywhere.  This is pretty cool.  I mean, part of what I like about it is that if your main communication tool to your friends is email, then typing out variations of what you have been doing is damn tedious.  Unfortunately it means that my funny anecdotes get written up here, and when I go to tell people about them, they're like, "Yeah, I know.  I read your blog."  I miss people laughing at them, that's all.  Anyway...   Saturday.   Watched  Rage , saw the last 15 or so songs of the top 50.  So pleased that that  Remix to Ignition * is not number one anymore.  But instead it has been replaced with that  Where is the Love  song.  Yitch!  Also saw the new Evanescence clip,  Going Under .  I knew it was them before the info came up.  There's no other gothy cute chicks about at the moment.  It was okay.  Eh.  I liked  Bring me to Life  better, it had more of an immediate impact on me.  As soon as I heard it on Nova, I knew it would be good.  * As if I am gonna run my hands through his hair!  Yuck! Yuck! Yuck!  Then, dum dum dum, I finished my Synopsis.  Victory Wiggle!  The rest of the day consisted of playing the piano, talking to Hannah, seeing David, having food.  Then I decided to go to the FOME Mask ball, instead of the video night Dave and Josh having.  So I got out a dress I wore to my 21st and got the orange and vodka stains out of it with a bit of nappy-san.  It was very impressive.  And I got it dry and everything.  I went as a Platonic Form.  I lasted for about an hour and a half.  It was really boring and the music sucked.  So I rang up Dave and they sent around my sober saviour,  urlLink Mr Bowie .  A big thanks to him for picking me up and taking me to a place with booze and people who will talk to me.  (And a big thanks to Jennie and Liam for talking to me a bit during the ball.)   Sunday.   No idea.  Just got up really.  Invention for the day: The cure for hangovers.  Poor Dave.  (He says he's not hungover, he's still drunk.)

      Coming to you once again, live, via the net and all it's wonders... it's my blog!  I was going to blog at the library, but it is chaos there.  I even saw someone using the machines for the library catalogue to write email.  Tsk and grrr.   Semester 2, Week 8, Day 4.   Woke up early again, like 6:30, but managed to fall back asleep in time to be woken rudely by my alarm clock at the crack of mid-morning (9:00).  Went to lovely Metaphysics class and discussed the Bundle Theory some more.  No more bundles next week.  We are looking at tropes.  (Tropes are less universal than both universals and properties.)  I kept really quiet about my dream.  I got an email back from Dirk, (I emailed my custom question yesterday) and he said my topic was fine.  I am a bit worried, because his response did not indicate to me that he understood what my question was.   Eeek.  I am sure he's just impressed that it's only Week 8 and someone has put forward a custom topic rather than just using one of the one's he's made up.  I really want a copy of  Philosophical Papers  by David Lewis.  Unfortunately it comes in two volumes, I want volume I.  The stupid catalogue system for the library doesn't display separate availability of each volume.  Which is dumb.  It just said it was available.  So, I went and had a look and they only had Volume II.  I hunted around for Volume I, because things are often misshelved (not always accidently).  So then I borrowed Volume II to see if it would differentiate between the Volume II I borrowed and the Volume I, which I thought might be borrowed by someone else, and then I could recall it.  Anyway, today I went to the library and Volume I still wasn't there.  So I went and looked up its status, and it just says that Volume II is out (duh, I knew that.  I have it on my desk at home.)  I hunted around a similar section in Undergrad for a bit.  (I will explain.  There are two collections in the Matheson Library (which is also called the Main Library).  There is the Main Collection (which is also called the Matheson collection) and the Undergraduate Collection (but there is no Undergradute Library).  Finally, I went and had a whinge at the friendly librarians.  The result is that I have filed a Missing Book report (my first) and if it does turn up I shall be notified and I can come and collect it.  If it's just been borrowed, I don't know what that means.  But why the two volumes aren't stored distinctly is beyond me.  I was going to do moreon my essay, but I ended up watching most of  Passions  instead.  Ethan still doesn't know that Julian slept with Theresa.  Plans for this evening include going swimming with Kellie and Jeanie.  Invention for the day:  Accurate weather forecasting.

      Dave's net seems to be in order.  I am here again.  Singing was good last night.  We have one more singing before performance.  Scary.  We sang in formation last night.  I am stuck up the back between the tenors and the basses because there are just too many girlies.  It's okay.   Semester 8, Week 2, Day 3.   Had horrible sleep and tossed and turned.  Woke up at about 5:30am with a proof of Principle of the Indentity of Indiscernables (which most normal people think is false) in my brain and then couldn't get back to sleep.  (The PII states that if two things share all of their (relevant) properties, then they are the same thing.  It's what Leibniz believed.  I know!  Back to him again!)  The solution went something like this (I think):  The description of a world with two identical spheres cannot be stated without: a) mentioning the word "two" (begging the question over the number of spheres) OR b) refering in some way to the first sphere when describing the second (and thereby using some identity property) because they aren't relevant (if they were, then at least one of the properties would be different) Therefore there can only be one sphere.  So, you could try to describe the world as:  There exists a Sphere such that (Properties of Sphere, P) and there exists a Sphere such that (Properties of Sphere, P) and Sphere does not equal Sphere.  But then you have used (in the last bit) a identity condition ("not equals").  If you don't have this last bit, then all you are saying is that Sphere exists and Sphere exists, but to get two you must say that they aren't equals (seeing they both share all of P).  But I remain unconvinced by my own genius.  This is mostly because I don't understand it.  But then as I was waking up at a more civilised hour (9:30am) I started thinking about my essay and I got all excited.  I spent this morning writing another 1200 words on my essay.  The other stuff is about 300 words (Bibliography, Question and three tables) and the essay is now just under 3700 words.  Only about 800 to go (and as it's usually give or take, I could write about about another 500 and be fine.)  Some of the stuff is really rough and other stuff needs expanding (and other stuff needs deleting), but important thing is that I am getting it from brain to lap top (via fingers and keyboard, with chocolate).  I want to go look some stuff up in the library once four o'clock comes around (free parking).  But I can look up the references here, which is better because I have access to a pc here.  Who knows what my chances are at the library.  Invention for the day: Proof of the Principle of the Identity of Indescernables.

      At Dave's place with semi-chancy internet connection, so we'll just see how this goes.  Aesthetics was good.  We learnt about a guy called Schiller.  (Whenever I hear that I just want to put my hands in sneak position and walk forwards funny, like Michael Jackson' s  Thriller .)  Anyway, this is the Kant and Plotinus love child I mentioned a while ago.  He seems to think that the French Revolution failed because the peasants didn't appreciate beauty enough.  That's probably an unfair simplification of his views.  I asked the other students about what they were going to write on.  They're like, oh, this is so much easier than Metaphysics.  Yeah, we don't understand any of metaphysics at all.  Uh oh!  One guy said he was going to have to lock himself up for a week to write on it.  I feel completely the opposite.  I am not too worried because I understand what is going on in Aesthetics, I'm just not sure I can write 4500 words on something where the rules haven't been established.  (With Metaphysics there are rules.  They are trying to balance simplistity with explanation power.  With Value Theory, it's all a little weird.)  I think I will end up writing a "Compare and contrast" essay.  They're easier.  If you understand two systems, you write about them and say how they're the same and how they're different and as long as you pick two systems that haven't been done (or aren't being done) by everyone else, it's all good.  Originality city.  I went and checked that my hold for the Lewis book from Gippsland was working, and it wasn't.  So I went and found another copy of the book and borrowed that and I will return the recalled one on Thursday.  Why they couldn't have borrowed that book instead of re-calling my book is beyond me.  Spent a bit more time on my Metaphysics essay and watched crappy tv.  Then watched good tv.  (All good tv can be watched, if you are prepared to stay up late enough.  I think it re-sets at around 4:30am.)  Saw the conclusion of  Simone D'Whasisface's babies .   Decided there was no moral to the story.   Semester 2, Week 8, Day 2.   Spent this morning doing the reading for Thursday's Metaphysic class.  It didn't take too long because although I read it, I didn't read it very deeply.  It's not very interesting anyway.  The only problem I had was that I couldn't find three versions of the Bundle theory in  Three Versions of the Bundle Theory .  Bit worrying really.  I mean, the article has four parts.... and one's the conclusion and one's the introduction.  Then I worked some more on my Metaphysics essay.  I am up to 2500 words.  Yay me.  I still have a whole section to write, plus expanding heaps on another section.  I have about five sections and a conclusion.  I have put a back up of my essay on Dave's pc now.  Phew.  Can't be too careful.  Just the mere fact that a pc might suspect you are doing honours is probably enough for it to destroy all your work.  Especially if that pc is really a lap top.  My car is covered in bird crap.  I am not worried, it will rain eventually.  I just can't be bothered turning the car around so that I'm not under the evil tree that the birds sit on.  I am not allowed to park before our house, close to the drive way because the guy who lives there puts letters on your windscreen says not to park in front of his house.  Apparently it makes it messy!  When my house mate persisted, he tracked her down and knocked on the door and asked her personally.  Scary as.  Plans for this afternoon include a bit of shopping for groceries.  I seem to have eaten all the ones I bought on Saturday. Sigh.  Oh, and singing.  Invention for the day:  Fridges that never run out of milk.

      I'm in the Ming Wing basement.  Spent most of the weekend writing my Metaphysics essay....  After writing on Saturday I went home and fumed about having the book recalled and thought of all kinds of ways of retaining it.  Somehow, not returning the book never entered into it.  Wrote 57 words of my essay, plus  bibliography, plus my custom question.  Dirk gave us questions, but I didn't like any of them and we are supposed to do a custom question if we can.  Hannah and I then sat down to a fine evening of food, books (she,  Illuminatus , I,  The Plurality of Worlds)  and watch Collingwood come from behind to unexpected beat Brisbane.  A lot of people are going for the ABC team in the finals.  Hee hee.  (ABC - Anyone But Collingwood).    I keep having baby dreams.  Really really scary.  Was discussing with David this morning.  Then it occured to me it was probably my thesis, it's due in about nine months!   Sunday.   Spent most of the day struggling to write Metaphysics essay.    Now up to about 1500 words.  Only another 3000 to go.... sigh.  And the ones I wrote need work.  Also watched second half of Sydney smashing their way through Port.  Congrats to Sydney.   Semester 2, Week 8, Day 1.   Week EIGHT????  After week ten there's a week break and then only a few more weeks to go!  (There are 13 weeks in a semester.)  I have good news on the book front.  Went into the library this morning and there's two copies in our library, one lost and another I have.  But there's another copy in Gippsland, so I asked for it to be sent here.  I hope they don't look and see I've already got it....  Also returned a heap of books that I think I've finished with.  Including Clay and  Annas.  Also returned  Greek Homosexuality  with the pictures....  Had this great dream it was only Friday night so I didn't have to go to Aesthetics.  Sigh.    At uni people are becoming more plentiful and look a little more haunted.  Invention for the day:  Some kind of mechanism that breaks through blocks in your brain so you can get over it and keep writing another 500 words or so.

      I don't understand.  The more it rains, the cleaner my car remains.  The less it rains, the dirtier my car becomes but the less I'm allowed to wash it.  My car is currently quite clean.   Sunday.   Went to Chadstone, kept warm.  Came home, watched a lot of tv.  A nothingy kinda day.   Semester 2, Week 9, Day 1.   I am over the fact that it is Week Nine.  After Week ten there's a break, that'll be nice.  Went to Aesthetics and finished talking about Schiller.  Didn't make any Michael Jackson jokes, because they aren't funny.  Went to honours lunchies at Wholefoods and discussed various kinds of things.  Asked Toby how work was handed back.  I was vaguely wondering if I should have gotten my Synopsis back, after all, other people were getting their theses back.  Toby said it was up to my supervisor.  Went to a class that Toby ran on responding to feedback and teasing more constructive feedback from your supervisor.  Then tried to get in contact with Dirk and ... success!  Booked myself in to see him on Wednesday about the Lit Review I have to write for my thesis.  Asked him if he knew how I could get a copy of  Philosophical Papers  Volume I.  So he checked out the department library and lo, there was a copy.  So he borrowed it for me.  Excellent....  I will return it on Wednesday when I see him.  Then I went home and worked on my Metaphysics essay.  I felt guilty about watching  Malcolm in the Middle  and not going to aerobics until I realised that a) there's no singing on Tuesday, so no-one will be there to give me crap and b) I can say I was working on my Metaphysics essay.  Hannah will back me up.   Semester 2, Week 9, Day 2.   Woke up and realised that anyone who would give me crap for not going to aerobics spent last night at the Marilyn Manson concert.  Smugness and virtue prevailed.  Guess what?  Finished a draft of my Metaphysics essay.  It is just over 4500 words.   Yay me.  I even wrote a conclusion and finished the introduction.  Now I'm at Dave's.  Plans for the rest of the day include grocery shopping (yawn).  (But I have no food.)  And that's about it really.  Dave is asleep after staying up all night with Josh.  Josh hasn't gone to sleep yet (he went to the concert too).  It's all very silly.  Invention for the day: Instant sleep drink.  Just add water and swallow for 8 hours sleep in a single tea spoon.  I used to think any amount of sleep was normal....

      Well, Spring sprung briefly, but today it seems to have snapped back.  Don't get your fingers caught in it.  That can really hurt.  Having a chill out, Chadstone kinda day.  Try to keep warm and stay awake.   Semester 2, Week 8, Day 5.   Spent the morning writing more and more of the Metaphysics essay of doom.  Here is my topic:  Peter Forrest compares his theory of possible worlds with the modal realism of David Lewis and lists four advantages of his theory over Lewis'. Explore the claim that Lewis cannot provide the same advantages and that such advantages are appropriate for a theory of possibility.  Exciting huh?  Then David and I rode into the city along Scotchman Creek and Gardeners Creek and the Yarra.  Then we rode back again down St Kilda Road, some street starting with I, and along the railway from Caulfield.  Friday night Hannah and I played Upword and spent hours on a jigsaw puzzle.  David went and saw Walken.  At about 3:00(am) David came back to find Hannah and I going made with the last bits of green gorilla bits of puzzle but we gave up and went to bed.   Saturday.   Spent some of the morning sleeping and the rest watching  Rage .  It was stinky.  I hate that  Remix to Ignition  song.  I am also pretty annoyed with  Angel  and  Where is the Love .  Yuck, yuck, yuck!  Then drove to Jeanie's place.  Picked up the Jeans and Matt and went to Melbourne Aquarium.  We parked at Crown.  We saw many specky fishies, jellies, corals, sharkies and rays.  I am only in it for the rays myself.  Fiddler rays, sting rays, eagle rays and other rays are way cool.  I bought a fridge magnet from the gifty shoppy.  It has a leafy sea dragon on it.  (They are superior to see horses and sea weed.)  I recommend the Aquarium.  But I would say to hold off until the shark enclosure is finished.  Also, it is $14 concession and $22 for adults.  So, I thought it was better than a movie (a movie being the standard metric for cost for entertainment value) but I don't know if some people would think it was better than 1.5 movies.  After that we had some food.  Went back to the Jeans' and chatted.  Then Dave and I went around to Mel, Ben and Sascha's place and chatted there.   Watched Port slaughter the Bombers.  They were so grounded into the dirt, one would think Port were playing Pepper (ground pepper...).  Went home, slept.  Phew.  Invention for the day:  Fake concession cards.

      Go Pies!  Phew, just had the last class before the break.  Break?  What break?  That means I don't have to come into uni right?  Big deal, I only come in a few times a week anyway.   Semester 2, Week 10, Day 3.   Spent the morning reading about wuv and sex.  Wuv, true wuv.  Then sat around for about an hour working out prime numbers and the difference between them.  For a while it looked something along the lines of 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2 and then it started to get a little more interesting, there was a 12 and a 10 up around 89 and 100.  I think I got about to the 160s.  Then David and I went out for lunchies (to Singapore Hut.)  The lady asked if I wanted something different.  Alas no, I got gado gado once more.  Chatted for ages about the necessity of the lower class.  Then we went to Chadstone.  I bought a Collingwood Scarf from the AFL shop near Myer in preparation for Saturday's Grand Final.  They'd better win now.  Then Hannah, Dave and I took turns in preparing food, chatting and I lost a game of Up-word.  Hannah read that thing I mentioned by freaky feminist Firestone and we chatted about feminism.  "I'm just a girl in the world..."   Semester 2, Week 10, Day 4.   Went to Metaphysics class on Events.  Are there really such things as events?  How do we differentiate between them?  This is all very morbid as most of the examples involve something like "is the event 'Brutus stabbed Caesar', is that the same event as 'Brutus killed Caesar'?"  We philosophers have a morbid imagination.  My fave examples are things like, if B pushes A of a building and C shoots A on the way down, who is responsible for A's death?  Mmmm, culpability questions.  (That kind of value theory is heaps better than stinky "what is beauty?")  Incase you are reading this and you are my Aesthetics lecturer, I'm trying to spark discussion.  Honest.  Then chatted briefly to Dirk, who has had a look at my Metaphysics essay.  I need to chase some things up to finish it.  I want it to be OVER!!!!  Plans for this afternoon include chasing up this journal article that Dirk mentioned and finishing evil essay.  (I need a break from thinking about wuv and stuff anyway.)  At some point I will have some food.  Honest.    (Hmm, I seem to use the word "Honest" to indicate I'm lying.  How paradoxical.  Well, I won't do it anymore!  Honest.)  Invention for the day: University printers that work.  Strange idea, I know.  Ooh, and photocopiers that never run out of paper.

      I am trying to keep this regular, but I am also trying to do work.  I am proving to be more sucessful at keeping this regular.  I've just had the last rehersal for singing before our performance on Saturday.  Eeek.  My throat is utterly sore.  I've had this odd cold thing for about 10 days now, but the only symptom is a sore throat, a slightly swollen gland or two and a mild fever.  Odd.  So now I'm at Mel, Sascha and Ben's place.  Though who knows where they are! :)   Semester 2, Week 10, Day 1.   Got up really early... been covered already.  Had final Aesthetics class, on Hegel.  No idea what I'm going to write an essay on.  Nothing really inspires me at all.  Went to the philosophy lunchies at Wholefoods and discussed with people about the oral presentation on Friday.  People got their marks back and everyone seemed to do quite well.  Then walked up the stairs with Toby, (first time I'd walked up to the ninth floor) chatting about my lit review, and picked up part of Jamie's thesis to edit as part of our peer review thing.  Someone else has my draft Metaphysics essay.  Eek - I don't like it any more.  Then I to the library and got a CAVAL card so I can borrow from other places.  Monash doesn't have a couple of key books that I need.  So I walked home, dumped some books, grabbed others and drove to Caulfield.  Took the train to Flinders Street and the tram to Melbourne Uni.  Started to get blisters, but had to persist.  Finally I found what looked like a big library and I registered to use Melbourne Uni's library with my CAVAL card.  Then I went and used their catalogue system, scary.  Finally, I managed to find the book I was looking for - Roger Scruton's  Sexual Desire.   Unfortunately this guy is a big sexist homophobe with some great ideas on love....  But I managed to borrow the book using their self borrowing facility.  This avoided the massive line that had queued up while I was registering in the first place.  Then I went and found the Education Resource Centre, which is for books that are "borrowed seldomly".  I thought it would be where books go to die, but it was actually quite okay.  Once I found the door into the building I had no problems and I even managed to flirt slightly with the guy behind the desk whom I borrowed from.  Cool, then it was back to Melbourne Central, train in peak hour (I got a seat, victory wiggle) express to Caulfield, drove home, watched Simpsons and Neighbours then off to aerobics.  How virtuous was I.  Once again it rained on a Monday evening.  What's the deal with that?  It always rains on Monday nights.  So that was my Monday.  Phew!  (Went to bed and read the rest of the  Dilbert  book I'd been plowing through.  It's the most I can read without feeling that I'm doing work.   Semester 2, Week 10, Day 2.   Got up about 8:00.  Read Jamie's bit of thesis.  In retrospect, it may have been harsh to read it as soon as I got up...  Then read a bit about love from some feminist freak called Firestone.  Men have to idealise women because they have to be able to justify loving a woman and elevating her to their social status because women are inferior freaks.  No wonder women are messed up, with all these feminists for them who needs people against women?  Then what?  Ah yes.  Most of the day involved reading, playing the piano and playing Metallica on the piano.  (Playing piano is different from playing Metallica because you have to convert guitar and make up half of it and skip the solos and your hands hurt more.)  Have not seen David since Saturday.  Feel a bit bummed out about this - but we are having lunch tomorrow.  I didn't read as much as I would have liked to and I couldn't concentrate much.  Hence the piano.  I should really buckly down and knock over this lit review, but I need to decided on a topic and all I have is all these ideas that float around my brain and nothing really gluing them together.  I have started taking notes on my thoughts about my thesis again.  Then singing and now here.  That's it really.  Invention for the day:  Something that is silent but keeps time for you while singing.  Maybe an  invisible and silent gnome could tap the time into your knee or something.

      Woah, I haven't written in ages.  This doesn't really reflect anything (like how busy I've been) except for possibly how impossible it's been to get a pc at uni.  People are like, busy or something.  Woke up heaps early (6:00) this morning (see Sunday for why I went to bed early).  So I decided to come into uni and have a go at a pc and net away.  I had 56 unread emails, 50 were spam....   Semester 2, Week 9, Day 3.   From memory....  Dave came round last night and we went over my Metaphysics essay.  He didn't like all the bits I didn't like.  This confirmed my suspicion that they were crap.  I got up and worked some more on my Metaphysics essay.  Took out and reshuffled crap bits.  Went and saw Dirk about my lit review.  He says I need a topic before I can start and I have to read around.  I don't want to read around, that's a sure waste of time.  I still need to write (on average) 2000 words a week.   Semester 2, Week 9, Day 4.   Went to Metaphysics class.  Went op shopping with Jeanie.  Went to the Salvo's on Dandenong Road and Canterbury Road.  Bought two dresses,  a shirt and a top that's 90s 70s retro.  Spent most of the day at the Jeans' chatting, watching tv and eating.  Yum.   Semester 2, Week 9, Day 5.   Spent entire day listening to ten poor little honours students present their papers.  Lots of nibbles, biscuits, tea and cake in between.  Afterwards, had too much wine with other philosophy students, left uni around 7:00.  Confessed to Dirk to being a Collingwood supporter.  He said that didn't make sense, because I wasn't a bogan.  I said I hadn't had enough VB.  Got a lift home from a drunken Amy and her boyfriend.  They dropped me off on their way to bible study (she was presenting, hopefully on the story about the wedding where Jesus turns water into wine, at least she'd have an excuse then...)  Then rang Dave and he picked me up and went to Polly and Olav and Daniel's place and chatted heaps.  Pizza.  Yum.   Saturday.   Umm, ah yes.  Slept in a bit.  Went to Seaford to see the end of Clayton Road.  It goes on for a bit, but it could hardly be called Clayton Road anymore.  Had lunchies with Dave and came back again.  Slept some more on the couch while waiting for delayed telecast of Collingwood v Port game.  Watched Pies completely demolish stinky Port.  I have never seen so many Pie fans mock strangle themselves.  (Port are a bunch of chokers - two minor premierships and still no grand final.)  (In case you are aliens, or watch Rugby I will explain, Minor Premiers are when you win the most number of games during the year, you get the most number of points and finish on top of the ladder.  You are seen as being pretty good, so why you then fail to get into the Grand Final is beyond me.  Maybe you were just pretending to be good.)  Then watched some of the Brisbane v Sydney match.  Annoyed that they watered the field, because it was pretty slippery.  Got bored about half way through and watched  Sister Act .  I am vaguely ashamed.   Sunday.   Got up early.  Possibly because of snooze on Saturday afternoon.  Wanted to go somewhere and do something.  Sat and sulked on the couch until about 10:00.  Got in the car and went for a drive.  I don't know how it happened, but I ended up at Wilson's Prom.  (About 3 hours drive away from Melbourne.)  I bought a fridge magnet and a post card.  I have the entrance sticker on my car too.  Then I went and got my feet wet in Norman Bay (the main beach at Tidal River, the camping ground at the prom).  After that I drove out and saw all the burnt bits.  The grass trees (aka Black Boys) are doing really well.  Then I went for a 4km walk in the Northern part of the prom and saw some mangrove swampy stuff.  I think I got a little burnt.  Drove home.  Then had dinner, watched Simpsons and decided to clean the house a bit.  Also did a load of washing, which I'd been meaning to do.  Got down to the last of the emergency stash of underwear.  Have decided to by more underwear so this doesn't happen again!  Went to bed early, was stuffed.  And that's why I'm up early today.  I have worked out that I need about 8hrs and 40 minutes sleep.  Invention for the day:  Cheap fridge magnets.  At about $5.00 each, my collection is worth more than my fridge!

      Well, I shan't write about intentions about writing regularly anymore.  Decided at the start of the week (Tuesday) to have a break from philosophy as I was going quietly mad reading and reading and reading and reading.  For completeness...   Semester 2, Week 10, Day 5.   Read stuff and wrote stuff.  Can't really remember.   Saturday.   Had hair cut.  Not bad, at $27.50.  Went shopping.  Saw Grand Final at Mel, Sascha and Ben's place.  Would have been nice if the Pies had turned up to play.  Stinky Pies.  Had singing performance, which was fine.  My parents liked it.  Stuffed up a little, but so did everyone at one point.  (Shh, don't tell.)   Sunday.   Can't remember.  Think I read.   Mid Semester Break, Monday.   Went to the Dandenongs with David.  Had lunch at Henry VIIIs.  Went to Aerobics, was the only person I knew there.   Mid Semester Break, Tuesday.   Went bikeling.  Rode from my place to the Gardner's Creek Path to Malvern East Station.  Then along the Alemein Line to the Eastern Freeway.  Then along the Main Yarra Trail until the Scotchman Creek Trail at St Kevin's.  The got back to East Malvern Station, rode through Boyd Park to Hughesdale Station then along the Railway Path to home.  Took about 4 hours.    Jeanie came over and she, Hannah and I chatted.  Then Hannah and I went and got videos and watched them.   Mid Semester Break, Wednesday.   Spent the morning watching wideos with Matt at Jeanie's place.  He was home sick.  Jeanie came home sick in the afternoon so chatted to her too.   Mid Semester Break, Thursday.   Watched videos.  Went to Dandenong with Jeanie, after her knee appointment.  Walked around looking at bad clothes and expensive shoes.  Tried on a great pair, but the 8.5 and the 9.5 didn't fit and they didn't have a 9.  Ce la vie (or whatever).   Mid Semester Break, Friday.   Watched videos.  Went on a spree with Hannah at Chadstone.  I BOUGHT SHOES!!!  (I am THE fussiest shoe person in the history of the universe.  I think it's because I want an inconsistent combination of properties in shoes, so I can never find what I want.  Like I was looking for something that's flat and looks nice.  AS IF!!!  And then there's other combinations like leather and cheap, plain and not boring, comfy and not grandma shoes.)  Watched the last of the videos.   Saturday   Watched video hits and rage.  Finally got fuel for my car.  Plans for the day inlcude shopping for grocery type things and something else.  Who knows?  Hannah's invention for the day:  A store at Chadstone that sells essays.  Invention for the day: Shoes that instantiate impossible combinations of universals.  (It's a metaphysics thing.)

      I just got spam from Bertrand Russell.  How positive.  (That's a joke, Russell was a big maths and logic philosopher who was involved in what became known as Logical Positivism, which is widely discreditted by foreward thinking Australian philosophers and still embraced by skeptical American philosophers.)  A  urlLink picture  of me in Elizabethan (I not II).  (Thanks to David for hosting this.)  Spent the rest of Monday watching Friends and writing my Lit Review.  Wrote about 700 words.  Yay.   Semester 2, Week 11, Day 2.   Worked on Literature Review.  Wrote about 500 words.  Played the piano.  Went for a drive with David.  Went to singing.  We listened to a recording of us singing at the performance and then discussed what carols and performances we wanted to do for Christmas.   Semester 2, Week 11, Day 3.   Worked on Literature Review.  Wrote about 1200 words.  To have breaks I ate and played the piano.  Watched crappy television.    Semester 2, Week 11, Day 4.   Worked on Literature Review.  Wrote about 50 words.  Went to Metaphysics class and learnt about events and maths.  There will be no class next week because everyone's taking industrial action against the Nelson Deforms to funding.  (Not reforms....)  Made an appointment to see Dirk on Monday.  Went home and worked on my Literature Review.  Wrote about 600 words and I'm now going to send a very, very rough draft to Dirk.  Like, I'm still about 900 words under, but that's good, because I know I'll get comments and suggestions and I still have a bit of fleshing out to do.  (Especially on Plato's theory of love.  What a loser.  Thinks he's so clever because he hides behind dialog and uses Socrates as a mouth piece.)  Plans for this evening -  go swimming, chat with Jeanie, eat, sleep.  Invention for the day: Bathers and towels that dechlorinated themselves and dried perfectly in your bag from week to week.

      No introduction.  Ner.   Rest of Saturday.   Shopped (as foretold).  Played the piano and polished my new shoes.  Polished my old shoes.  Polished my shoes that are falling to bits.  Washed polish off my hands.  Went to Jeans' place for tea and the went to Daniel's place with her.  Watched "Reefer Madness", well it was on while we talked.   Sunday.   Went to St Kilda for lunchies with David.  Chatted lots.  Then went into the city in an attempt to salvage his mobile phone because the screen has died, but they weren't open.  Went to Dave's parents' place for dinner.  Came home and busted Hannah writing her essay on my laptop (which has been on the coffee table in the lounge for the past fortnight).   Well done to her.   Semester 2, Week 11, Day 1.   Woke up at 6:00 with some ideas for my Lit Review and my Aesthetics essay.  Fell back asleep.  Went down to Dandenong where the nice man at the phone place broke Dave's phone screen, so he is getting it replaced.  I have lent Dave my phone, so I'm not contactable, except through my house phone.  This afternoon I have a peer edited class.  I read Jamie's thesis ages ago and marked it up.  I haven't looked at it since.  Eh.  I pity the poor person who looked at my Metaphysics essay.  I have changed it a fair bit since I handed it in.  Plan for the rest of the Semester:  1. Finish Lit Review (including discussing with Dirk how to tie my three ideas together.) 2. Finish Metaphysics essay (I was waiting on the feedback I am going to get today.) 3. Research and write Aesthetics essay. 4. Sleep.  Invention for the day:  A mobile phone with space to put a spare sim card so it can be kept safe while you lend you phone to someone.

      I am about to have a meeting with Dirk, re: my lit review.  I managed to catch up with him on Wednesday and make the appointment I'm about to go to.  Goody.  Also went to the library and borrowed  Examined life : philosophical meditations  by Robert Nozick and got two articles to read.  I keep waking up really early, like at 6:30.  Why?  Can't wait until day light savings, that should stuff up my body clock quite nicely.   Semester 2, Week 12, Day 4.   Read one of the articles I photocopied.  It was really good.  The theory behind it is that we want to be loved for the attributes (properties) that we believe are central to who we are.   So when someone complains that he is only loved for his body, it is legitimate because his body is not central to his self-perception, he would rather be loved for things that are central to his self-perception (perhaps his car, intelligence, pay packet or sense of humour.)  It also explains why someone may find it okay to be loved, just because they are blonde, if being blonde is central to his self-perception.  Then sat around a lot.  Had a sore back and my stomach felt crappy.  Yitch.  So, due to it being so lovely a day, I went for a bike ride.  I put sunscreen on my face and legs this time.  I didn't put any on my arms (which were sizzled the most on Tuesday) because they hurt, so I wore my long sleeved rain jacket, which is fairly cool.  (Though I looked pretty silly, as there was no chance of rain.)  I rode from my place, along North Road to the Bay, then down the Esplanade, Beach Road and the road that's across the train line from the Napean Hwy to Carrum Station.  Got some food there.  Then road along Dandenong Creek to Dandenong Station and caught the train back.  Phew.  Came home, showered and sat around for a bit.  David rang and he came over and we went to the Hut (Singapore Hut) for dinner.  It was a bit awkward to talk to him, hadn't seen him since Saturday night.  (I won't put today in because it hasn't really started....)  Invention for the day: Self inflating bike tires that remain at 60psi and don't deflate during the week.  (With automatic puncture repair.)  I keep having to go to 7/11 (or some other petrol station) to pump them up.

      After working hard all morning, I am now at Mel and Sascha's place.... which is for sale.  They have to move soon because the landlord is selling. Sniffle.   Semester 2, Week 12, Day 1 cont...   Went to Aesthetics.  It was great.  John doesn't want a research essay, he wants us to demonstrate that we have ideas and can follow them through.  I can do that!  Met with Dirk at Wholefoods.  He said that my essay lacked structure and direction and suggested two possible topics for thinking about what I was writing.  I took the one that he mentioned ages ago.  The conversation went like this "I'm just your supervisor, not your father, but I think that this would be a good topic...."  So I have been looking at love more and more and more and my brain goes around a lot.  The topic is about what accounts of love say about the object of love.  Does one fall in love with someone for their attributes, or does love bestow further attributes?  Is the object of love unique or does  loving bestow uniqueness?  Stuff like that, anyway.  Went to the library and did some research.  Got a great article by a guy called Simon Keller, called "How do I love thee?  Let me count the properties."  Then went home and made a back up of my lit review and massacred about 1500 words from it.  (I have pretty much re-written it from scratch over the past few days, I even have an introduction!!!)  Then it was off to aerobics.  I didn't go last week, and Mel (our instructor) said she was going to have to work us hard to make up for it.  (She wasn't there last week either, she was in Brisbane.)  So I bounced and flounced for an hour.  Felt really good afterwards.   Semester 2, Week 12, Day 2.   Woke up at about 7:30, tried to do work, but the sun kept calling me.  Went for a bike ride, rode from my place to Jells Park along Scotchman Creek trail, then along Dandenong Creek to Boronia.  It was so nice and pretty and the wind wasn't too bad.  Tail wind on the way back.  Took about 5 hours all up.  Unfortunately I was out longer than I thought I would be.  My arms are really quite pink and I have to have tepid showers.    I came home and watched  Passions .  (Timmy, the witches doll, has had his wish come true because it's Christmas and is now a real boy!)  Worked on my lit review for a few hours.  I wrote my introduction and started to feel really good about it again.    I had drunk so much water that I had to go to the loo every 15 minutes for an hour.  It was quite destracting.  Singing was good.  Went put away our old music from the performance and got  out new music.  We went over Sussex Carol and O Holy Night (that song that Cartman ruins in South Park).  Then went round to Mel, Sascha and Ben's place for dinner.  We were going to have buritoes, but Sasch had put in so much chilli that we got pizza instead.  I didn't feel so good by the end of the night.   Semester 2, Week 12, Day 3.   Didn't sleep well.  Got about three hours sleep before I woke up in pain.  Put some stuff on my arms and legs, but still couldn't sleep.  Ended up reading for about an hour and a half before the words got blurry enough that I felt I would sleep.  Got up at about 8:30, after I heard Hannah leave for her trainig course.  Spent the morning in my nighty and a flanny doing my lit review.  I am now up to 3400 out of 4000 words.  It is due on Monday (next week).  I am going to uni now to hand in a draft for Dirk to review.  I know I'm under, but he always suggests stuff.  Besides, there are a few articles I could try and chase up if needs be.  Invention for the day: An anti-sun ray that removes sunburn, tan lines and freckles.  Cure is better than prevention!

      Good morning all.  Coming to you live via the arts basement of stressed little students and me, your illustrious leader.  This is the second last week of semester.  Scary huh?  Well, probably not for all you worky types.  On a grumble, I'd just like to say that there are two things I really don't care about.  1.  Bali Victims.  (After all, they're 16 year old night clubbers and dense football players!!) 2.  Rugby World Cup.  (I don't even know if it's league or union.... and I don't know how to tell.)   Semester 2, Week 11, Day 5.   Went over my Metaphysics Essay for the nth time.  One of my books has been recalled, again, so I went to Deakin (Burwood) to get another copy with Dave.  Hung out with Jeanie and we went to Chadstone.  I found her shoes too.  (I am on a roll.)  Then went back to her place and watched  You Can't Stop the Murders .  Well, most of it, until the DVD player cracked the sads.   Saturday.   I watched  Rage  and  Video Hits , while looking at Metaphysics Essay for the n+1th time.  Rode to Oakleigh and did some shopping.  Came back, watched  Shine  (which could have been renamed  Dull .)  Then went to Jeanie's place and watched  Ed Wood , which was funny and quite a cute film.  Ended up drinking with people and lounging on the Jeans' bed.  We had seven people on it at one point, but I was falling asleep so I went home.   Sunday.   Got up late.  When I went to watch  Video Hits  stinky car racing was on.  Ended up reading a book by the chick who wrote  Sophie's World .  It purports to be a translation of a letter to Saint Augustine (Saint Monica's son) from the lover he left to join the Church.  I thought it had some interesting ideas, but amateur philosophy (such as  Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance ) leaves me a bit cold.  Her basic tenant seems to be that he cheated and betrayed her for his immortal soul and Lady Abstinence and this has left him a hateful creature who spurns God's creation.  Went around to Jeanie's (again....) and we went to Emerald.  Walked around Emerald Lake and saw Puffing Billy and lots of small children.  We were there to pick up some art Jeanie had entered in a show.  So we walked around the art show for a bit, but it was mostly crappy landscapes.  (Well, they were good landscapes, but who wants to look at that sort of thing unless you're Mary Poppins and you jump in the picture and can run around the beach.)   Semester 2, Week 12, Day 1.   Eeek.  I think most Monday's start with 'Eeek'.  Plans for today include:  1.  Going to Aesthetics and feeling guilty that I haven't done any work on the subject. 2.  Meeting Dirk and talking about my literature review.  Currently it is a brief history of the relationship between love, marriage and sex. 3.  Who knows!!! Frollicking in the sun?  Invention for the day:  Objective Art Viewer.  Then we wouldn't need critics.

      I just had my final class for the semester.  Lucky me.  Dirk provided biscuits.  Spent last night at the Jeans' watching Delta Goodrem and Babylon 5.  In that order.   Semester 2, Week 13, Day 4.   Did not wake up at hour stupid because went to bed later.  Yay.  I think I have too many pillows.  Three seems excessive.  My head is only really on one....  Today's class was on the existence of numbers.  He called for his pipe and he called for his bowel and he called for his fiddlers three.  Russell:  He called for his fiddlers where fiddler a does not equal fidder b and fiddler a does not equal fiddler c and fiddler b does not equal fiddler c.  It's all very silly.  I have to go to Deakin to return the books I borrowed.  Then it's off to Chadstone to spend money I don't have.  My other plan for the day is seeing Jeanie (again, for the fourth night this week) to do circuit training (weights) with her.  Never done it before.  Should be sore tomorrow.  Hate my Aesthetics Essay with every fibre of my being and not working on it today.  Going to Chadstone.  Hmmph.  Invention for the day:  A web based enrolment system that works.  I tried to enrol in my thesis for next year, but it refused because I was already enrolled in it.  But I'm only enrolled in this half of it and not the next half.  Grumble.

      Handed in stuff.  It's all good.  Went to Aerobics on Monday, it was really good.  Then went back to the Jeans' place and watched  Queer Eye  while chatting.   Semester 2, Week 13, Day 2.   Spent the day attempting to assemble a meal with no actual food.  Also thought about my Aesthetics Essay.  I thought about it so much that I wrote a fair bit, but nothing in essay format.  Read a bit about Plotinus.  Went to singing, which was good.  We learnt a new Christmas Carol.   Semester 2, Week 13, Day 3.   I am so over waking up at 5:30am and not being able to get back to sleep.  Spent this morning working on Aesthetics Essay.  Wrote about 1400 words.  Yay me.  It's supposed to be a 4500 word essay.  Sigh.  Came around to Sascha's.  He's listening to music and I'm blogging.  Plans for today include: 1. Going around to Jeanie's so we can go and pick up a bike she's bought. 2. Some kind of grocery or food shopping.  I had rice and saltanas in milk for breakfast this morning. 3. Sleeping.  Invention for the day:  A fast forward button for soap operas.  Like, get to the point!

      Things are due in today.  Eek!  I had to get up early to make sure I'd get a pc.  Naturally when I walked into the computer lab there was like, three other people.  Metaphysics Essay:  Complete.  5146/4500 words written. Literature Review:  Complete.  4001/4000 words written.   Semester 2, Week 12, Day 5.   Had very sucessful meeting with Dirk regarding literature review.  He said it was pretty good, but it needed structure and tying together with a common theme.  He said I didn't have to read anymore.  Yay.  I don't think I could have if I'd needed to.  We Greek Geeked.  He said I had lots of ideas, I just needed to get them out.  I said I was going mad.  He said Socrates would say I was not going mad.  I said it hurt a lot.  He said I needed to give birth to my ideas.  I said I felt like Zeus, who gave birth to Athene from his head by having someone hit him in the head with an axe.  So I went home and worked on my literature review, drawing diagrams of the various relationships and going slightly mad.  Went to my parents place for dinner.  Had a long chat to them about stuff.  Mentioned David Lewis's theory of possible worlds (what I wrote my Metaphysics Essay on).  Mum couldn't believe that people get paid for that kind of thing!  Dad lent me some books on Saint Paul (which I used for my lit review.)  We discussed at length where I was going to ride with Jeanie on Saturday.   Saturday.   Slept terribly.  Woke up in a blind panic about literature review.  Couldn't think of any common themes to told the piece together.  Eventually fell asleep after convincing myself that everything would be okay.  Got up early, about 7:30, and worked on literature review.  Bashed at brain until thoughts came into place.  Had to get ready for bike ride.   I took Bowie's bike (which Jeanie was going to ride) to the Petrol Station and pumped up the tires.  They were flat central.  Got some breakfast and milk on the way back.  Jeanie came over.  We rode from Clayton to Oakleigh Station.  Took the train to Richmond, then to East Camberwell.  Rode back along the Alamein line and then along Gardners Creek to Forster Road, then through the uni back home.  It was pretty warm by them time we got back.  I was wearing lots of sunscreen.  The Jeans did really well.  Spent the afternoon crashed out on the couch, watching  Bridget Jones's Diary  and  Back to the Future I .  BttF I is my fave movie of all time.  I finally got one of the jokes that I'd never gotten before.  Lou: Are you gonna order something kid. Marty: Yeah, um.  Give me a Tab. Lou: Tab?  I can't give you a Tab unless you order something! Marty: Okay.  Gimme a Pepsi Free. Lou: If you want a Pepsi pal you're going to pay for it. Marty:  Look, just give me something without any sugar. Lou: Something without sugar.... (puts coffee on the bar.)  Now, of course, when he's asking for a Tab, Lou thinks he wants the bill (cheque, if you are American).  I got that bit.  But when Marty asks for a Pepsi Free, it's like Diet Pepsi, Pepsi free of sugar.  But I never got why Lou was so weirded out and said he's have to pay for it.  I just took it for granted that it was obvious Marty wanted a Pepsi without sugar....  Sometimes, I'm just a little slow....  Then it was off to Thorne's birthday dinner and after party chat.  Which was good.   Sunday.   It was only yesterday and I can't remember.  Oh yes.  Got up and watched Video Hits while reading through my literature review (again) and changing what I wrote about Saint Paul (again).  Dave came over and proof read my essays.  Watched  The Living Daylights  because there was crap on tv and went to bed.   Semester 2, Week 13, Day 1.   Last week of semester!!  (Aesthetics essay due in to weeks.  Number of words written: 0.)  Who knows what today will bring?  Plans for the day include:  1. Handing in narty essays (Metaphysics and Lit Review) 2. Going to Melbourne Uni and returning books. 3. Generally hanging out in the city.  Invention for the day:  Library shoot in every home that you can return books into and they go along little tubes to the right library.

      Woah, okay.  Someone hasn't blogged in a week.  And it's not for want of a computer either.  I have been near one, it's just all alone and isolated and not connected to the greater outside world.  A bit like me sometimes.   Semester 2, Week 13, Day 5.   Last day of semester.    I worked on my aesthetics essay.  Played the piano.  Painted twenty nails, ten with four coats (fingers) and ten with two coats (toes.)    Went and saw my parents.  Handed back the books on St Paul I borrowed from Dad and managed to avoid discussing philosophy of love with an  agapist .  Went swimming with Jeanie, Kellie and Josh.  Then sat in spa and steam room.  After that, dinner at Singapore Hut followed by cups of tea at my place.  Rabbitted on about Plotinus... but only after being asked!   Saturday.   I could have been dressed before Jeanie rocked up, if I'd tried.  Went riding with Jeanie.  We rode through Monash to Forster Road then along Scotchman/Gardner's Creek to Jell's Park.  Then from Jell's Park along the Dandenong Creek Trail to Dandenong.  Train from Dandenong to Westall (all zone 3) and then home.  Had a great talk to Jeans.  Attempted to have a snooze during the after noon.  Chatted to Hannah's family who were over baking Cookies for the Cookie Monster/Hannah Monster Birthday Party.  Got ready for party.  Had dinner and beer with Jeanie and Matt.  Went to party.  Came back from party and was hung over....   Sunday.   Shook and threw up.  Rang up Jeanie to say was not going tree planting as could not remove head from pillow.  Slept in until about 1:00.  Wow.  Got a lift from Hannah to go and get  my car.  Came back after brief chat to the Jeans and Matt and watched three movies before going to bed.  (Watched  Bridget Jones' Diary ,  The Ten Commandments   (but not the bit that has the ten commandments in it, I'm really only in it until Pharoah actually let's His people go) and  Mission Impossible II  (I didn't realise it was II, having seen neither of them, I didn't have my glasses on so the title looked like a fuzzy I, I'd been told bad things about II).   Exam Period, First Monday.   (Not that I have any exams....)  Aesthetics essay.  Piano.  Spent the afternoon getting groceries and stuff.   Exam Period, First Tuesday   Essay.  Cracked sads around noon.  David came over and looked at essay.  It was bad.  Really bad.  Unbelievably unsalvagable.  Bad.  Like, incoherent and no point.  Bad.  Blurted out ideas while David took notes.  Went to singing.  We sang the stuff we went over last week, plus  Silient Night  and  Carol of the Drum (The Little Drummer Boy) .  Came home and removed 2300 words from essay.  Ouchies!  Replaced with 500 words about the Soul.  Now up to 1800 words.   Exam Period, First Wednesday.   Essay.  Essay a lot.  Wrote 2100 words.  All day.  At one point I had a shower.  At some other point I got something to eat.  At no point was the piano touched.   Exam Period, First Thursday.   Managed to  make appointment to see accountant regarding tax.  Phew.  Sat and watched tv with Hannah.  Managed to remove oneself from couch to go and blog, check email and stuff.  Intend to go to circuit and get out some books for Kellie and Jeanie, they are interested in Aesthetics (poor fools...)  Invention for the day:  Some kind of Hoover like device that makes great ideas articulate.  A manual car that doesn't stall would be handy too.

      I bought a new bike!  Just a quick blog before I go ride my old bike....   Exam Period, Second Thursday.   Woke up at 12:30am and couldn't get back to sleep.  Slept from about 2am-5am.  I think I may have a problem....  Got up early.  Went to parents place.  Dad and I spent two hours at Invanhoe Cycles looking at bikes.  I bought one.  (I recommend Ivanhoe Cycles to anyone.  The lady there is REALLY great, she knows her stuff (she has four bikes) and knows girly things about bikes.  The fellas are also great.  Other people who have bought from Ivanhoe include my mum and David Golding and they'd probably say great things about them too.)  It's a Giant XtC3 with Hayes brakes, Shimano gears (lots and lots, possibly 27 (at least 24)) with a Deora (?) changy thing.  I.e. much better than current bike, bigger, lighter and better gears and brakes.  Got a touring saddle for the Great Vic Bike Ride.   Also got a pump (I know, I didn't have one before, I'm so ashamed), some drink bottles and holders and a new head thingy (bit what connects the frame to the handle bars, it needed to be shorted and higher for me.)  Because of the disk brakes, Dad has to teach me how to get it in and out of the car (have to take wheel off), so we put it in Dad's X-Trail and I will pick it up tomorrow.  Invention for the day: Giant XtC3s in purple.  Mine's red.

      I think it's great to see the weather finally starting to behave like weather should.   Exam Period, Second Tuesday - Cup Day.   Woke up at 5:30am  (no alarm, just woke up).  Got ready and put bike in car.  Drove to parents place in Templestowe.  Rode with Dad along Main Yarra Trail to city.  Rode to St Kilda along the bay.  Rode back.  86km, 5hrs of riding.  We left at 8:30am and got back at 4:15pm.  Went home.  Had shower.  Singing.  Slept.   Exam Period, Second Wednesday.   Woke up at 5:30am (again).  Read until about 6:30.  Started to drift off to sleep, but alarm went off at 7:00.  Lay in bed for an hour.  Got up, had shower and got ready.  Removed bike from car, ineligantly.  Looked down at bike lying on the road, looked at shin sporting two new parellel scratches from where the forky hooky bits that go around the front axel had removed some of my skin.  Admired blood.  Drove to Black Road, was fitted for a new bike.  (New bike, new bike, new bike.... to the tune of  More Beer .)  He was very tall and all legs - and just a little scary.  I am inflexible in the legs and my upper spine curves a little.  Wow.  My shoulders are also a little uneven, but that's what happens when you break your collar bone I guess.  Then drove to Murrumbeen Station and went into city.  I got to go on one of the new trains.  Oooh.  You can see all the way down them (well, half the way down, they're in two sections of three carriages).  Went to Allens, bought sheet music.  Walked up to Jeanie's building (447) and walked back down again.  Lunch with Jeanie.  Shopping with the Jeans.  I bought a $2 skirt.  (It was $4, but they were having a 50% off sale.)  Train back was not as exciting.  Then and now I'm at Monash Uni.  No plans for Thursday and Friday.  Bit lame.  Oh, according to Dad, supposed to go bike shopping.  Invention for the day:  An emailing system that can sense the mood of your email and inserts appropriate greetings and saluatations so you don't have to spend ages wondering if "cheers" is appropriate and should you use your last name.

      I'm free, I'm free.  And this little kid walks past and says, "Bad luck, mister.  I'm four."  Well, now that I've given away the punch line to that joke, we can begin.   Exam Period, First Friday.   Finished Aesthetics Essay.  Had it proof read and then ran around uni trying to find a printer that worked.  I finished.  I finished.  (Only a whole semester to go....)  Got back my Lit Review.  I didn't write a conclusion.... but I still got a HD.  Conclusion: I so rock.  Went to Jeanie's place and watched 1940s version of  Jane Eyre  with Mr Wells in it.   Saturday.   Woke up really depressed.  No essay to write.  Woke up early too.  Like at 7:00.  It's just wrong.  Sat around and watched  Rage  until it finished.  Even watched the horrid songs that I'd usually switch over at.  But there was nothing to switch to.  All very sad.  Dallied on the piano for a while, but didn't really feel like it.  Attempted to have a snooze.  Decided at about 1:00 that with only seven hours to go, will get ready for party.  So I went and had a bath and soaked for a while.  Then I dyed my hair black (it was a Halloweeeeen party).  That took a while.  Then it was shower time.  Washed black out of hair and off skin.  (I read in  Cosmo  or something that cigarette ash will remove hair dye from skin, but this isn't something I was to test empirically.)  Then I sat around with a towel on my head and painted my nails.  Then I had to wait for my nails to dry (only three coats and no toes, because was going to wear big boots) before I could remove said towel.  When I removed towel, hair was fluffy central.  Decided to emphasis fluff.  Got ready for party (like the dressing and make up part) and went had dinner with Jeanie and Matt.  Watched three hours of bad bad  Disco Max .  Went to party.  Which was great.  Was not terribly tipsy ditsy thing, though at one point I launched myself at a bed (we were all sitting around in the coat room) and kept sliding along and fell down the other side.  I was not embodying the Form of Elegance (it's a Plato joke).  Got a lift back to Jeanie's (where car was) then drove to Bi-Lo and did some shopping.  Had to put my jacket on so I looked decent.  Made a cuppa tea, read until about 2:30 and went to sleep.   Sunday.   Got up at about 10:00.  Went riding with Jeanie.  I am really impressed at how quickly she's taken to this riding thing.  So we rode from my place along North Road to the bay.  Then north along the Bay Trail to Port Melbourne, where we encountered a nasty side wind that blew grit into our faces.  Not so pleasant.  Then into the city along the Light Rail line.  Had lunchies at South Bank.  Then road along the Main Yarra Trail, Gardner's Creek and Scotchman Creek to home again.  All good.  I think we must have done about 60km.    Fell asleep in front of the tv last night and woke up to the end of Australian Idol.  What's really bad is that I must have slept through the rest of it.  Then I was too asleep to do anything about the fact that I knew it was Australian Idol but I couldn't change the channel....  Yuck.  Saw Guy (the one with the big hair) sing that  Climb Every Mountain  song from  Sound of Music .  Then watched  Temple of Doom , my least fave Dr Jones story.  Hannah came home (it was her birthday, still to get her something because I couldn't get the thing I wanted to get) and assembled her DVD shelf to go with her DVD player and her DVDs.  We put some VHS in there too, I don't think that's wrong.   Exam Period, Second Monday.   That's today!  Well, plans for today include:  1. Go to account and sought out nasty taxation. 2. Go see Kellie and watch that pirate film with Mr Depp that everyone keeps going on about. 3. Bouncies (Aerobics).  Plans for tomorrow include:  1.  Going to my parents. 2.  Riding a LOT with Dad along Main Yarra Trail from Templestow to City and back (about 80km). 3.  Singing.  Plans for Wednesday include:  1.  Getting fitted for new bike (a currently uninstatiated property) from Mr Kennedy.  They measure you up and give you a list of what stats you require in a bike.  Then they charge you $85 for the privledge.  Yay.  It is really worth while if you are planning on riding a lot (like you will be spending more than 3 hours at a time on a bike.) 2. Lunchies with Jeans. 3. Frollicking in the predicted warm weather until predicted cool change.  Plans for rest of the year include:  1.  Lots of parties. 2.  Great Vic Bike Ride (from Mt Hotham to Mornington this year). 3.  Christmas.  Invention for the day:  Internet banking accounts that you can access telepathically, rather than having to find somewhere to use the internet.  Gawd, what a rip off.  Talk about inconvenient.

      I'm at Jeans's place.  Everyone has the net at home, but me.  (And possibly my house mate.)  We just did Circuit.  It was good.  I met a guy called Greg who was in FOME ages ago....  I can't remember what I did the rest of Monday, I went shopping and went to aerobics though.   Exam Period, Third Tuesday.   Went for a bike ride.  A LONG one.  Rode to Oakleigh, then along Scotchmans Creek to East Malvern, then up the Anniversary Trail to the Main Yarra Trail, then along the Yarra Trail to Templestowe.  Had lunch with Dad and Selina and rode back.  I was a bit stuffed at the end of it all.  Went to not-singing.  A bunch of singers sitting around on a Tuesday watching The Simpsons and discussing Mel Gibson.   Exam Period, Third Wednesday.   Can't have been very interesting because I don't remember and it was only yesterday.  Did have a picnic with Hannah and Sascha, which I remember, so it was cool.  Watched a lot of tv I think.   Exam Period, Third Thursday.   Today.  Went to Chadstone and took advantage of the Target sale, bought a pair of shorts.  Looked at buying bathers, but it was all too soul destroying.  Buying bathers is possibly worse than buying shoes, and THAT's saying something.  Went to Spaghetti Junction Spotlight and bought an embroidery kit.  Went home, started embroidering with Hannah while watching Buffy (she's run out (watched all her DVDs) but she's getting more (more DVDs)).  Dave rang and came over with food.  Had lunch with Dave and Hannah.  They left, Hannah to work, Dave to somewhere else that was less awkward.  Watched tv and embroidered, went to Circuit.  Invention for the day:  Some kind of machine that customises bathers to suit at a reasonable price.

      I suppose since it's a month ago I might as well put it on my blog.  David and I are not going out anymore.  He broke up with me a month ago (not that I am counting).  He did mention it (subtley) on his blog.

      I don't dread Monday's the way I used to.  Maybe it's because the TV is better and the shops are open.  Nah....  To continue on from Thursday, went bike riding with Benji along Scotchman, Gardners and the Yarra to Punt Road.  Rode back again.  Went and picked up Kellie, went to Circuit training.  Was stuffed.    Went to Jeanie's and had dinner with her.  Home.  Slept.   Exam Period, Second Friday.    Spent the morning doing domestic chores that had been neglected during hectic Aesthetic Essay writing period.  Put away lots of clothes, cleaned things, re-arranged furniture and did a few loads of washing.  Yay.  Went to my parents place after lunch.  Went shopping with Mum and bought two pairs of knicks (padded bike pants that one does not wear knickers with).  Took the new bike for a ride with Dad round Templestow.  Only did about 9km.  It was great.  Rode up some special hills and made it without dying.  It's a great bike.  Yummmmmm.  Had dinner with Selina (sister) Mum and Dad.  Sat around while they watched  Kath and Kim .  I said that they were bogans and Mum asked what a bogan was.  I said that they were lower lower class.  Mum said they weren't.  But they ARE!!!!  Dad showed me what to do to get the wheels of the bike off, they have disc brakes so you have to insert the disk between the brakes before fastening everything up.  It's all good.  Put the bike in the car, went home, took bike out of car, re-assembled, put bike in garage.  Slept, not very well.   Saturday.   Woke up early again.  Went and watched  Rage .  Went to Century City Walk (aka The Glen) and watched  Matrix III  with Kellie, David, Emily, David, Jeanie, Matt, Michael, Tim, Josh and Scott (in no particular order).  Many of whom were hung over.  Matrix was good.  Went to the  Pancake Palour  and chatted about movie.  Took the Jeans to Le Knicks on Beach Road, Black Rock and she bought a pair of knicks too.  This is a decision she would not regret.  Then we went to East Camberwell just to check I knew how to get from the station to the bike path.  Drove Jeanie home.  Rang Sascha and caught up with him.  Their house has been sold and they are looking for a new one.  Went and got ready for the Philosophy Honours Students We've Finished Cocktail Extravaganza.  It was in Berwick, so I got to drive down the new bit of the Monash Freeway.  Oooh.  Over dressed and under dressed (I was cold and too formal).  Marie-Rose, (the chick whom I was closest to and who was hosting) said I looked great.  I didn't drink because I was going bike riding the next day.  Ended up spending most of my time in the laundry with Marie-Rose's boy, Cain, and her mum's pregnant cat who was in labour.  Don't know how many kittens she had, because I left at about midnight.   Sunday.   Went riding with Jeanie, Matt, Josh, Benji and Damien.  We met at my place, rode to Huntingdale.  Took the train from Huntingdale to Richmond, Richmond to East Camberwell.  Rode along the Anniversary Trail to where it meets the Main Yarra Trail.  Rode along there until we got to Westerfolds park.  Had lunch at the Mia Mia gallery.  Rode back again.  Bumped into my Dad on the way back which was fairly freaky.  He was riding with a bunch of people too.  Went back on the train.  Everyone had a pretty good time.  The new bike is still great, though covered in dust.  Had a shower and got ready for dinner.  Walked to Kellie and Dave's place, had dinner with them and David and Emily.  It was really nice.  Great food and wine.  Got a lift home and lent Emily  Bring Me To Life  sheet music.  Was tired, went straight to bed and managed to sleep the entire night.   Exam Period, Third Monday.   Today.  Caught up with Hannah by chatting to her all morning.  Had not seen her since Friday.  Don't know what I'm going to do for the rest of the day/week/year.  Invention for the day:  Something to do idea generator with 100% accuracy guarentee.

      One week until GVBR (Great Vic Bike Ride).  Yay.  580km of pain and torture.  No, it will be fun!  Starting to have a small life crisis as the result of having to make decisions.  Like, what am I going to do after Honours.  The FORBIDDEN question.  I don't know.  I was happy not knowing.  Now I think I should know.  My marks (see below) are not good enough to get a sholarship.  Yeah, I'm getting firsts, but they're not high firsts.  I still have some computer skills to fall back on, I'm sure.  Sigh.  I think I'm just too bored and have been moping a lot.  Boredom, such luxury.  Singing was pretty busy on Tuesday.  We are preparing for our performances.  Carols.... again.  I saw a sign outside Target and was amazed at the number of days to go.  I have done nothing.  I am somehow proud of this.   Exam Period, Fourth Wednesday.   It was 35 degrees today.  I went bike riding.  I rode from my place, to Jells park, to Heathmont, back to Jells park, to Dandenong.  About 60 km I guess.  It was great.  It was hot.  Came home and had very cold shower.  The tip of my nosey got burnt.  I ran out of sunscreen (I reapplied twice).  Had a snooze and turned on the air conditioning.  Mmm, must be summer.   Exam Period, Fourth Thursday.   Woke up early, but then went back to bed for three hours.  Bliss.  In the mail I got my tax return, went into uni.  Checked my mail.  Found out the essays were back.  Went and collected my essays.  The marks I got were just, fair and dissappointing.  "Ainsley, you have good ideas, but they are not completely thought through" would be a good summary of the comments.  At least I put conclusions in these essays (not like my literature review.)  I got a HD for Metaphysics and a D for Aesthetics.  Went to the Glen, did some shopping, depositted tax return.  Went to Aussie Disposals to look at sleeping bags, tents, mattress rolls and the like for GVBR (Great Vic Bike Ride).  I figure I will use the stuff, so I might as well own it.  Went out to Philosophy Honours and Post Grad dinner on Bridge Road.  Had great Lebonese food and conversation.  Found out one guy got a 91 for honours, including 95 for his thesis.  Spitting.  He's just completely enthused and 100% committed (he reminds me of Alex, really out going, friendly and utterly committed.)  Dinner was okay.  Ate more than I should (like I felt ill, not in the diet sense).  Came home, read, slept.   Exam Period, Fourth Friday.   Today.  Spent this morning chatting to Hannah about Life, the Universe and bad tv.  Went and saw Toby and asked if he had any ideas for turning good ideas into better essays.  He was a little helpful.  Went and just saw Dirk.  He has suggested some things for starting to write my thesis.  He really liked my Metaphysics Essay.  (He was also the second marker on my Aesthetics Essay, so I'd better not tick him off.)  Invention for the day: Argument Wall that allows arguments to be bounced off, rather than having to use an actual person.  Should be big enough so that it can be driven up.

      Public apologies for not turning up to Alex's Engagement Party on Saturday.  I'm sure you all had a great time.  I have come to a number of conclusions since I last wrote.  Firstly, based on empirical evidence and reasoning to the best explanation, I have concluded that I am a god.  There's no better explanation for the powers I have.  Let me explain.  I believe I am the God of Wind.  All I need is a bicycle to direct it.  No matter which way I turn I always have a head wind.  If I ride somewhere, on the way there I have a head wind and on the way back I have a head wind.  Wind farmers should employ me to ride around their farms.  They'd clean up!  Secondly, I need more clothes.  Well, one's that fit would be nice.  I mean, sure, the size 14 skirt I bought at the op shop doesn't look too bad on, but it's not supposed to be a hipster skirt.  Thirdly, sunscreen works.  I know because I am burnt in the bits I missed.   Exam Period, Third Friday.   Slept in a bit.  Bummed around all morning.  Played lots of piano, listened to CDs through the DVD player to discover that as the DVD's connected to the VCR and the VCR's connected to the TV that it comes out mono.  Spewin'.  Started packing stuff for trip away and went and picked up Sascha from his place.  Took Sasch to a Post Office so he could pay rent.  Went back to his place and got stuff from his house.  Went to my place and had lunch, chatter, ate, had tv on but it was boring as.  It was about 1:00 and we weren't meeting Benji until 7:30.  Decided to pick up Benji from Bundoora, rather than waiting around.  This reduced the time available by two hours.  Excellent.  Drove to Sascha's place to get things he'd forgotten.  Drove to Warringal Plaza and bought lunchy stuff for trip to Venus Bay.  Had a cup of coffee.  Mmmm.  Went to Bundoora and picked up Benji.  Drove back to his place.  Sat around while he packed.  Rang Jeanie, turned out that Matt wasn't back yet.  So we loaded up the car and went and bummed at her place for a bit.  Watched crappy tv and wandered around until Matt came back.  Matt eventually arrived and we began our epic journey to Venus Bay.  Stopped off at Grantville and had dinner at about 8:30.  Only Rick's Fish was open.  I had my first pumpkin fritter.  When we got there we unpacked and sat around for a while, then most people went to bed.  I stayed up talking to Sascha and Benji.  Benji made the mistake of asking about my thesis, so I TOLD him what it was about.  He didn't mind.   Saturday.   Went to bed at about 2:30am.  Got up at 5:50am.  Went to the beach with Benji and Sascha.  Walked along beach and back again.  It was really pretty and the sun was just coming up.  Back to the Holiday House at about 7:30, and the Jeans was up.  We had breaky and chatter as people were getting up.  Then eventually we snapped into gear and went to Wilson's Prom.  It took about 1hr 15mins to get to Wilson's Prom.  If one is following Emily's David it is enivitable that one will speed just a little.  I guess he did just have coffee.  At the prom (which was lovely, it was about 30 degrees) we walked from Tidal River south around to Little Oberon Bay.  It was about 90 minutes, including walking along the beach before the start of the trail.  The heat was relieved by occasional sea breezes.  The ocean was green in some places and the sand was really white.  Had lunchies and sat around re-applying sunscreen before running into water.  I knew it would be cold so I went straight in.  Jeans was a bit more timid and got splashed up the front by a giant wave.  After standing there and swearing (which was so worth seeing) she came in too.  We figured out that if we stood in the rip it was warmer.  Damn irony.  The walk back was little harder for some.  But some of us went down the Lookout path for a bit, before coming back and overtaking again.  It was all good.  I found driving back to Venus Bay a bit of a strain and by the time we got back it was like 6:00 and I was stuffed.  We had pizza for tea.  Yum.  Sat around more talking and drinking and managed to make it to midnight before slinking off to bed.     Sunday.   Woke up at 7:30 but didn't organise trip to beach as it had clouded over.  Sat drinking oodles of tea as people emerged from slumber and made their way to the kitchen table.  At about 10:30 we went for a walk to Smythe Point, which is the tip of the penisular that forms the bay.  We would have gone all the way, but the path had collapsed into the beach.  Came back, had lunchies, packed up and went home.  Drove home via Coronet Bay and Corinella (where I used to live when I did VCE).  Dropped off Sascha at his place, brought his stuff into the car.  Well most of it.  Went to Benji's.  Found all the stuff that Sascha had left in the car.  Took some of that in too.  Went in for a cuppa tea and a chat.  Eventually went home and collapsed into small pile of exhausted Ainsley.   Exam Period, Fourth Monday.   (This all sounds so Christian.  27th Ordinary Sunday, 3rd Sunday of Lent etc.)  Yes, what did I do.  Ah yes.  Went bikeling into the city.  Rode along North Road, along the Bay to Port Melbourne and then along the Creeks to get home.  Took 3.5 hours with a few little stops but no major breaks.  Had lunch.  Had a snooze.  Went to the Jeans' place and chatted.  Went to Aerobics and suffered.  It was so hot.  Went back to Jeans' and watched  Queer Eye for the Straight Guy .  Home, dinner and bed.   Exam Period, Fourth Tuesday.   Not sure yet.  I got dressed and came to uni, what more do you want.  I need to do some shopping and I want to buy a new sleeping bag.  Got my stuff from Bicycle Victoria for the Great Vic Bike Ride.  Should be most excellent.  It's coming up real soon now.  Invention for the day:  Small time machine device that comes up pink as you are applying sunscreen to show you all the places you've missed while you are still standing in the bath room.  As you apply the sunscreen to the pink bits, they won't get burnt, so the pinkness dissappears.  Bra tan lines just aren't classy!

      I have an appointment to see an optomitrist in about 35 minutes.  In the mean time I squint painfully at the screen...  Went to Stonehenges house cooling on Friday which was pretty cool.  Danced heaps and spent two hours have deep and meaningful conversation with Penny.   Saturday.   SFA.  (Sweet F All).  It was grey and miserable.  Too much tv.  Eventually I went to the Jeans' place.  Went went to Justin's 21st and Vivienne's House Warming.  Sleepy.   Sunday.   Bike riding with the Jeans.  Rode into the city, out to Port Melbourne, up to West Gate Park, back along the bay with really nasty head wind.  Coming back along North Road I got a bit of grit in my eye.  Had to get a lift home from Jeans's dad, Les.  (Lucky I was carrying my phone.)   Managed to fit Les, Jeans, me and two bikes in a little Mazda 121.  Very impressed.  Still have to put the wheels back on the bikes.   Went home had a shower.  Lay in bed listening to the radio and dozing.  Had another shower.  Went to Wolfenstein for dinner.    Monday.   Everything is over now.  No more exams or anything.  People just seem to come into uni for fun, or work.  Or something.  Went to the doctors re: eye.  It still wasn't better.  Hannah gave me a lift to Monash. Doctor dyed it yellow and had a peek and flushed it and stuff.  She said I had a bit of damage to the cornea but it should be okay in a day.  She said if it wasn't, to go to the optomitrist.  So guess what? ....  Sat around doing not a lot because couldn't read, drive or walk anywhere.  The wind and sun really irritate it and I can't even go bikeling.  Sigh.  Watched Buffy, had a bath, had a snooze.  Sat around a lot.  Went to Wolfenstein for dinner with bunch o' people.  It was really nice.  Met two new people, Jeff and Rob.  Also caught up with people I had not seen in ages.  It was all good.   Tuesday.   Today.  Nothing much so far.  The future holds the following: Optomitrist.  Buy things for GVBR.  Singing.  It will be my last rehearsal before performing - I will miss the final rehearsal.  Oh no!  Should be okay.  I've done the carols for a couple of years now.  Invention for the day:  Removable eye balls that can be cleaned under running water and an eye socket vacuum cleaner.  Ew!

      Certainly haven't written for a while.  I have been on the GVBR.  It was great.  I recommend it (to anyone who thinks they can peddle 600km in 9 days...)  I am in full holiday mode.  I am unsure what to do with my blog.  It doesn't seem worth recounting all the time I've been spending sitting on the couch with a book, trying to keep cool.  How do I feel about doing Honours at the moment?  Well, it's better than working.  I have given myself a break, but the thought of getting back into it is a little rough.  Maybe it's just the heat.  Maybe its that my views on love are changing and in a great state of flux at the moment.  How can I be academic about something that I am in the throws of experiencing?  I don't have a topic.  I'm not really interested.  But with nothing better to do, it feels like a dead weight.  I think I shall go back to my original plan and tackle it in the new year.  That way I can continue to enjoy the break guilt free a little longer.  That sounds good.  I'll do that.  I might give this blog thing a break for a while too, until I have something worth while to say.

      I went to the doctors yesterday.    The name of the bone I broke is the radius (the outside arm bone).  I have decided to call it Frank.  I hate my cast.  I have so far refused to have anyone write on it.  Why glorify something that feels like a heavy, dead, rotting, all encapsulating mass that pulls around my neck?  My other arm has started to hurt from over use too...  Invention for the day: Instant replacement limbs, just add water.  I can't even get this one wet!

      All is quiet on new years day....  Benji's household had a pretty massive party at their place last night.  There are still about ten non-household cars out the front and in neighbouring streets that belong to sensible party goers who found creative ways of returning home.  I was not really in the mood for a party at all.  The state of my arm means that I get tired really easily and I certiainly didn't feel like explaining a bizillion times what happened to my arm.  So, before the party I made up a sheet of twenty things that didn't happen to my arm.  When someone asked (which almost everyone did) I got them to pick a number between one and twenty and gave them the appropriate response.  Here they are:  1.	A giant hippo fell from a tree and landed on it 2.	A really big mosquito bit me 3.	I was attacked by a swarm of kama kazi homing pigeons 4.	I was surfing on a wind turbine and I fell off 5.	Magpies stole the rest of my arm 6.	A small colony of space aliens started to use it as a base camp and I had to have them removed 7.	A drop bear, need I say more? 8.	A lemming was blocking me and then it suddenly exploded near my arm 9.	I was trampled my a herd of charging pygmy elephants 10.	Lars Ulrich mistook my arm for a drum stick and tried to remove it 11.	I attempted to prevent Cookie Monster from eating a cookie 12.	I was standing on the toilet hanging a clock.  The porcelain was wet and I slipped and broke my arm on the sink 13.	Dingo ate my arm 14.	Benji said I was mostly armless 15.	The piano got sick of me hitting it and called the domestic assault line.  In the scuffle with the police that followed my arm was broken 16.	Had to obtain special consideration somehow 17.	Macbeth, my cat, wanted some love.  A lot 18.	Joined a club, but I’m not supposed to talk about it 19.	A freak change in the political winds 20.	I told my parents everything  At about 10:30 (I'd been there for an hour) I'd had enough and went and hid in Benji's room for the remainder of the party.  Lame.  Invention for the day: Self keeping New Years resolutions.  (Perhaps some kind of refridgeration device is required.)

      Sufficient stuff has happened to me that I feel it worth while expending some effort on expounding it to the universe at large.  I am currently typing one handed... long story.   Key thing:   I have a new man... Benji.  He is marvellous.  I am REALLY happy.  People see us and go on about how happy we are.  Some people just want to generally vomit at us.  We take this as a compliment.   Where I am:   Benji's parent's farm in South Gippsland.  The lead up to Christmas involved a lot of trying to stay cool during the day (by undertaking such tasks as going to Chadstone and buying presents or sitting in air conditioning and wrapping presents) and seeing Benji in the evenings.  We had two singing performances and have visited people.  Christmas was pretty good.  Went to my parents place the Sunday before Christmas and had lunch and presents with them.  It was all good, they only tormented me a little.  Christmas Day was spent at the farm, opening presents and being dinked around the farm on a 200cc dirt bike.  I got to jump off to open gates a lot.  Once I was closing the gate and I felt this massive thump in my chest and I jumped and screamed.  I now know what 5000 volts of electric fence feels like.  I was okay, more surprised than hurt.  I also got the tour of some of the closer local thingies to look at, such as Mt Best and Agnes Falls.  Mt Best had Benji's old primary school, I got to see the roof he fell off...  Boxing Day was eventful.  Ha.  Benji and I went down to Turtons Creek and saw a water fall there.  It was excellent and lots of fun to drive around some steep, curvy, gravelly roads.  The creek was very pretty and the surrounding ferns were really cool.  I particularly liked the way that the water reflected to create dappled light underneath the ferns.  Then we went on the bike again to Scanels Road and saw the new bridge, which had replaced the previous evil bike eating bridge of doom.  The we went up to the end of the road and saw the ruins of this old house.  Then back to the farm.  I had expressed an interest in learning to ride the motorcycle, so we went up to one of the back paddocks and I managed to ride around for a bit.  The first time I took off I was completely out of control with Benji running behind yelling "Clutch!  Clutch!"  But I didn't come off and I went round a few more times.  Benji said that it was important to jump clear if the bike fell.  It was much easier once I got it into second gear, because the accelerator is much less sensitive, and I was beginning to feel pretty good about the whole thing.  I drove around a few times with Benji standing in the middle.  I was stopped and straddling the bike and Benji wanted me to turn it around so I could ride around the circle the other way.  But I turned it too hard and the bike became too heavy for me.  Suddenly the weight of the bike is too much and it's falling.  I remember wrenching at the handle trying to stop it from falling and I remember Benji running towards me yelling "Jump!".  I jumped.  I managed to fallmostly clear of the bike.  It had fallen left, and my left foot was still under the bike when Benji got to me.  He was worried I'd crushed my foot or ankle, however, it had been under the seat and it was fine.  I pulled it out from under the bike.  Benji turned it off and stood it up.  The bike was fine.  I was concerned about my right knee, which had fallen across the bike.  But it is okay, though a bit tender with some bruising.  My left wrist hurt a bit too.  We sat in the paddock for a bit, while we both recovered from a bit of shock and I said my knee and wrist hurt.  We decided I couldn't dink back on the bike, so I walked back while Benji took the bike back.  After a while my wrist really started to hurt and we went inside and I wrapped it in frozen peas while we played Simpson Trivia.  A few hours later and my wrist still hurt a lot.  Benji and I went to the hospital at Foster (which I was last at for Liam's knee when he got a massive hunk of wood in it at the prom) and waited for a while to see a doctor.  I was feeling drowsy and kind of nauseous by this point, so I was lying on a bed talking a bunch of crap.  The doctor saw me and didn't think it was fractured.  He wanted to strap it and see it on Monday.  But I had planned on going camping the next day with Jeans, so he said he'd better x-ray it.  Had to wait for the x-ray machine to warm up (another 20 minutes) then he nuked me twice.  I had to put my arm out at two angles that really hurt and hold still.  Had a look at the x-rays and everything looked okay, except that the end of the outer bone of my arm was fractured.  So, 6 weeks of plaster over summer, here I am.  Joy and rapture.  Had to call Jeanie and tell her I wasn't going camping.  Haven't told my parents yet.  Then yesterday we had to go into Foster to have the cast checked, but it was too loose.  So he sawed off the first one and put the second one on (the cast's understudy - it was recast).   Hung around Foster for a bit before and after being recast.  Got a fridge magnet.  Saw the other back part of the farm and in the evening we went and watched the sun set while seeing Toora and the prom.  Most excellent, though rather cold.  I can only wear one of the tops I bought as all the others have sleeves that are too tight for my arm.  So I was wrapped in two jackets.  That evening we watched some videos (  Black Books , way funny) but my hand was really aching and tingling.  The cast was too tight.  So Benji's dad got some pruning scissors and cut at the back of my hand (which hurt a bit) to free up some space.  I can now wriggle my fingers a bit.  This morning it was back to the hospital to watch the fish in the waiting room and to have the plaster checked.  Different doctor this morning and he was pretty happy with things.  I have to see a doctor on Friday, just so they can confirm everything's okay.  Today Benji took me driving up to Mt Fatigue which also was a lovely view.  My hair has gone skanky and washing is a chore.  I can't do up my shoe laces or open things.  Gripping is still painful, so I am almost completely only using one hand.  Though this morning I managed to hold my tooth brush with my left hand while applying tooth paste.  Invention for the day: Instant bone mending machine - based on ray technology.  (Or water proof casts, which ever's easier.)

       Day before yesterday.   Number of naps: 4  Most miserable and nappy day.    Had 10 x-rays.  5 of each fist.  Was assured that x-rays would be at doctors by receptionist and nice x-ray chick.  Nice x-ray chick did make be pull a fist for an x-ray which was less nice.  Grumble.  Sat in the waiting room unravelling my bandage to take my cast off while watching  Opera . My life hit new heights as I walked home in the rain attempting to hold umbrella and bag with cast in it.   Yesterday.   Number of naps: 0  Played  Sim City 3000 .  Went to Chadstone.  It wasn't too busy.  Went to doctors.  The 10 x-rays I had were not at the doctors when I went, so they had to get a radiologist to fax a report to the doctors.  Grumble.  Good news was there was no fractures we didn't already know about.  The doctor has put my in a half cast, but to prevent my wrist twisting, it also covers my elbow.  My arm is bent like Barbie's.  Sigh.  This makes moving, sitting, sleeping, standing and walking so much more interesting.   Today.   Don't know.  Just had a nap.  Invention for the day:  Instantaneous transporter for x-ray photos in non-digital form (i.e. the originals.)

       Yesterday.   I watched a lot of cricket.  I also watched  Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion  while waiting until 11:00 for the cricket.  They go to their 10 year reunion.  It's 2004.  I finished high school in 1994.  And what am I?  A philosophy student.  I think I'd be making something up too.  Something believable.  Something like, "I'm a Analyst Programmer for a multi-national corporation... no wait! I quit that job.  Nope, sorry.  I'm a philosophy student."   Today.   Less cricket.  Mostly in doctors waiting room.  Went to the doctors to have check up and potential fibre glass cast - as recommended by doctor on Friday.    He wasn't happy about something on the x-ray, (might be additional fractures or just a glitch).  So I have to have another couple of x-rays (including my right hand for comparison) and see him on Thursday.  At this rate I could become Fallout Boy! He took off the cast by cutting it twice and manipulated my hand for about half an hour and compared it to the right hand a lot.  I now have two sore wrists.    In the mean time my arm is now in the same old plaster cast with new padding and a bandage wrapped around it.  Joy.  At least it's firm - before I could move my arm up and down the cast by a good inch.  Tomorrow I go to have x-rays.  Thursday back to doctors.  On the plus side, if it's just the little fracture that the x-ray shows for sure, I may just have to have a splint - there is no need for the cast.  If, on the other hand I have additional fractures, it's bad bad news.  Invention for the day:  Doctor's surgeries that have decent radiology equipment so that they only charge one $92 consultation fee.

      "God, give us grace to accept with serenity the things that cannot be changed, courage to change the things which should be changed, and the wisdom to distinguish the one from the other."  - Reinhold Niebuhr (1892 - 1971), in a sermon in 1943  On Saturday the serenity kicked in.  I am getting over ruined summers, missed riding days and swimming opportunities, tunes that cannot be played and aerobics sessions that are missed.  I have done nothing towards my thesis either... (Shhh)  I have been feeling better about  (getting used to) only being able to use one hand.  I have stopped hating the fact that I can't cut a muffin in half and got on with the business of making the best cup of tea this side of the Prince Hwy.  I just leave the muffins to Benji.  (Big thanks to Benji, Jeans and Hannah.)   I haven't been doing an awful lot.  I borrowed videos from the Jeans and have been watching those.  Oodles of naps too.  This seems odd, but I am very tired a lot (according to my mother, it is probably because I am an evil vegetarian who doesn't take care of herself...)  My theory is that I am not doing much anyway and the body needs rest to heal.  If I sleep a lot, that's cool.  It's more hours in the day when I am not in pain.  (I am in less pain now that the cast is fitted correctly.)  Yesterday I went to  urlLink Chadstone  (the fashion capital) by myself.  I took the bus.  I must confess I have not done that in a while (years), which is odd, because you get the best parking spot.  I just found out it has over 8500 parking spots.  (Yeah, and with just under 400 stores they are probably mostly used by staff...)  I bought some lip balm from  The Body Shop .  That was my mission, and I achieved!  Today I went to Chaddy (the fashion capital) with Benji.  Did stuff.  (In case you are aliens, I should explain.  Chadstone (Chaddy for short) is a giant building where small amounts of soul (in the form of cash or credit) can be exchanged at a marked up rate for goods and services that are just fun to look at and no-one actually needs.  The people on the other side of the exchange feel that they can get away with charging a marked up rate because they a) make it so you don't have to get wet and b) make everything really, really bright and shiny.  Bright and shiny implies clean, new, good quality and great value.  Whether these attributes are actually posessed by the good is irrelevant.  The brightness and shininess makes it fun just to look, but there is always the danger that the goods will be so bright and so shiny that (like a magpie) one is compelled to swoop into the store and make an immediate exchange even if one shall not receive any more bits of soul until next Thursday.  During the Christmas Season this changes completely... people don't care what shiny things they come home with or how much soul it takes, as long as they have the same number of shiny things as the number of people on their list.)  I am half tempted to wear my sling even when my arm is better.  People get out of your way much more quickly.  I don't know if it's because they suspect I've been in a fight or they just feel sorry for a 25 year old walking around looking like a 5 year old in a cast.  But whatever it is, it works.  We should all wear one.  Invention for the day: Public transport that lets you ride depending on the amount of good will you extend towards the bus driver.  I could have gone to Ballarat.

      I must confess that I have not done terribly much since I last wrote.  Big news is that Mum and Dad are buying a block of land in Ballarat.   Wednesday  was miserable and I did nothing.  I was going to leave the house, but I didn't.   Thursday  was better because I went to  Scienceworks  with a bunch of folks.   Friday  I hung with Mum.  We went to patchwork shops and then a display village at Lynbrook.  Saw a lot of al fresco open plan living.   Saturday  and  Sunday  are a bit of a blur, but I got to see more of Benji.  I think we went to Chadstone the fashion capital and the Glen for a b'day present for Mum.   Monday  I watched a lot of tv and did some shopping.  I could only buy what I could carry, which isn't much.   Tuesday  I went to my folks place and looked at house plans with Mum.  Invention for the day: Oh I don't know.  Some kind of drug that makes you more  creative even though your wrist hurts.

      Things have been looking up a little since I last wrote (one haned... still.)  The end is in sight.  Only one more weekend and several more weekdays (9) until I see the doctor again.  (And he tells me to go and get more x-rays and it's still broken...)  I seem to have gotten my brain back.  To explain: my brain went away due to intense stress and pain (and neurofen) and I couldn't really think.  Getting my brain back means that I have started to think about my thesis and have even written some stuff (slowly) to send to Dirk (illustrious supervisor).  Which is GOOD.  Okay, what have I been doing....   Wednesday  I had lunch in the city with Jeans.  Saw freaky evil new Melbourne Central.  Very scary. I recommend a quick squiz, but leave your wallet on the train or something.  Had a snooze.   Thursday  I got my brain back and started writing.  Went to Monash with Mel and got some books from the library (which I've had before but wanted again).  Benji came home early and sold his brother's motorbike (his brother is in the US selling ski tickets and needed the money).  No snoozes.   Friday  I surfed the net and dinked around on the keyboard that is used for singing.  Had a snooze.  Then we (Benji and I) went to Toora, to his folks farm).   Saturday  and  Sunday  was spent in around the farm.  Went driving around Toora (this involved me steering and saying "second" "third" a lot to Benji who obligingly changed gears, it was fun.  I miss driving).  Had a snooze.  Went for a walk all the way up the back of the farm along a public "road".  Had a snooze.  Benji took me for a ride on a 4 wheel motocycle - which I did not fall off.  Went to Foster market.  We came back Sunday and had dinner with Jeans.   Monday  I went walking with Jeans along part of the Dandenong Creek trail (which I have ridden many a time, but not yesterday.)  (I miss riding...)  No snoozes.   Today  I will do at least one constructive thing that is not snoozing.  Honest.  Invention for the day:  Small stress ball that one squeezes and it removes the necessity for a snooze.  (I suppose there is  No Doze , but I like the idea of medication delivered via stress ball.)

      I have just looked over the posts since the start of the year and emphasised some of the days of the week.  Reading through the posts, it occurs to me that I am fast becoming the lamest person I know (who is not on anti-depressants??).

       Tuesday:  Slept terribly.  Then slept in until 11:00.  Netted.  Went to Chadstone with Mel.  Singing.   Wednesday:  Lunchies in the city with Benji (had a conference.)  Read   Lady of Quality .   Thursday:  Went to uni.  Saw Dirk.  (Now have feedback.)   Finished  Lady of Quality .  They get engaged - no surprises there.  Got invited to go to Oakleigh swimming centre.  Grumble.  You know who you are!   Friday:   Today.  Sigh.  6 weeks today since I broke my arm.  Yay!  Saw doctor this morning.    My arm has not healed yet, still have severe lack of twisting ability.  I may have permanent inflexibilty.  (The weakness (non-grippyness) is just immobilty, though it still hurts.)  So another 3 weeks in plaster cast.  Sigh.  Even if it's okay, I will need physio (4 weeks).  3 weeks takes me right up to the start of semester (and Jeans' birthday).    If it is still not better, I may have to have surgery.	The way it fractured indicates that I have ripped a disc out from where it should be.  Surgery would replace disc (I imagine.)  He said if it had been caught in the first week, I would have had surgery initially, rather than waiting and seeing.  Grumble.  Benji has been wonderful, came with me today (duh, I needed the lift).  I cried all the way home from Ashwood (High St/Warrigal Rd).  Invention for the day: VCR that recognises the difference between ads and program and will not fast forward through program.  Also there should be two remotes for any electrical good such as DVD, VCR, TV etc.  A his.  And a hers that cuts off his.    If there's one thing that REALLY bugs me, it's people flicking channels during the ads when you just know they're not going to flick back in time and you're going to miss the important 15 seconds of post ads where they resolve in some stupid way the cliff hanger they set up right before the ad break.  (I don't know if Benji does this.  I just wanted to rant.)

       Wednesday:  Lunch with Jeans.  Can't remember.   Thursday:  Cricket with Benji at MCG.  Well half of it before it rained.   Friday:  Read 113 pp of  Lady of Quality  by Georgette Heyer.  2 Snoozes (1 3hrs in duration).  Ate lemon tarts, lemon drops and lemon fruche.  Went out to dinner with Benji.   Saturday:  Lunch with Benji's family, who were in Melbourne.  Went to ace coffee and tea place in Sassafras.   Sunday:  1 Snooze.  Reached new depths watching Benji play computer games.   Monday:  Nothing!!  Reached new depths by watching  Judge Judy .  Also noted they are re-running  The Nanny  from scratch during the day.  2 Snoozes.  Invention for the day: Some kind of remote stick that pokes supervisors without them realising that you're poking them.  No email from Dirk.

      For sale: One styloid process of the ulna.  One female owner.  Low milage.  Recently involved in small accident.  Urgent sale, owner is losing her mind.   Recently   More of the same... few less snoozes.  My big news is that I have written thesis like words.  About 1500 of them.  My thesis topic is coming into creation.  When last asked what it was I responded:  "I am postulating that Lucretius is the true Avatar of Love and has a theory that is so original and has such great explanatory power that it has escaped the minds of philosophers throughout the ages.  (Yeah, something like that!)"  So don't ask.  It is now 7 weeks and 5 days since I broke my arm.  I am amazed at how it dominates every aspect of my life... even blogging.  Lesson for the day: If you think your underpants are much tighter than usual then check that you haven't put your waist through a leg hole.  Philosophical though for the day: If one can put one's waist through a leg hole, should one take comfort from this fact or be horrified.  Invention for the day: Hologram simulation of me that can go to parties so I can sit at home and feel sorry for myself some more.  All it would have to do is dance and wave at new people as they came in.

      I just removed the following from my thesis draft:  Therefore love is analogous to a dog’s desire to sniff one another.   Do Ants Dream of Anarchy?   I have been plagued by ants recently.  I can never bring myself to kill them, though Benji has no such qualms.  He explains it something along the lines of there being no one ant, as such, just ants.  I can't help it, just now I spent ages try to blow and flick the little antikins outof my bowl and into the sink.  Then I had an idea.  When I was talking to Benji about ants, it seemed to me that his theory was that the colony was analogous to a person and cells to ants.  No one really cares about a few cells, otherwise anti-dandruff shampoo manufacturers would really just be big undertakers.  But what is it that combines these things together...  Well, I thought it could be their desires.  Ants are all after the same thing.  If one is squished, the others continue onwards.  Is it sad that the ant died?  Has it lost something precious?  No, because its goal and desirres are continuing to be fulfilled.  If I die tomorrow, will I have lost something?  Yes.  I desire to write a thesis and that thesis will always remain unwritten.  What I cannot answer is if a whole colony of ants die, will that be sad?  I'm a bit of a softy (as my inability to squish a single ant shows) so I'm inclined to say yes.  It seems to be that a whole heap of rather clever industy to build the colony that is now destroyed was wasted... just as I am wasting my time on my thesis if I die tomorrow.  Anyway, I was just thinking about desires and their relationship to identity.  When a couple marry they are thought to combine their desires to some extent.  Society also sees them as a unit, perhaps because of their desires being the same (or their bank accounts and addresses...)  No real conclusion. :)  Oooh. One of the little guys certainly has a thing for the F8 key.... just you wait until Benji comes home.

       Responsive Love   Theories of love that consider that love is a response to certain properties of the beloved are called responsive love theories, by me anyway.  Here is a snippet from my Responsive Love thoughts that I thought was interesting.  It is perhaps a strange co-incidence that it is these three things that they differ on that have become the three criticisms.  Responsive theories of love may differ on the following: The object of love (properties or people) The kinds of properties (objective virtues, objective properties, subjective properties) How love endures (properties are constant, historical properties are formed, some other mechanism)

      I have discovered a lot of recent typos in my blog.  But I figure if I'm only 94 percent accurate then this is to be expected.   Thesis Update   After deciding I was doomed, doomed, doomed I came up with an idea.  I have split my outline into different Word docs, so I can work on them discretely and the whole "it's toooo BIG!!!" monster doesn't eat me.   Semester 1, Week 1, Day 5   First week gone already!!  (There are thirteen weeks in a semester.)  This morning I have written (constructed, there was some copying and pasting) 1000 words on Responsive Love.  Yay me!  Plans for rest of the day:  Either write more/finish Responsive Love or get jack of it and start on Creative Love. Go to Jeans place, have dinner and pick on Janeway's hair (TV1 is showing  Voyager .)  Invention for the day: Vegemite that doesn't sting open mouth wounds.  Ow!

       Value Theory Class   Value Theory class was good, but only ran for an hour.  Jeanette has to write a paper in June about agents and value and stuff.  I have to read Velleman for next week (which I already did because I'm great and supremely organised.)  Agents are things that can act (as opposed to real estate agents or travel agents who (supposedly) act one your behalf.)  and it is thought that they are responsible (to varying degrees) and can think things through rationally.  Moral agents are those things that we hold accountable for their moral actions.  They may be all agents, or a subset of agents.  Agency certainly seems to vary in its degree.  For example, a fully cognitively capable adult is considered to have full agency, while people who are psychopaths, deranged, emotionally frail, mentally slow or under the age of 9 are generally (often) held to have lesser degrees of agency.  It seems that there is a relationship between being a capable agent and having a good life.  What is that relationship?  It also seems that there is a relationship between the capacity to have long term relationships, goals and desires and agency.  Why?  And why are these longer term things valuable anyway?   Thesis Update   I was wandering around the library (as one can only do when it is impossible to get access to a computer catalogue in early semester because all the first years have decided to check their hotmail on the catalogue computers...) trying to remember the Dewey Decimal System (128.4 Love, 170 Ethics, 306.7 Sex, 870.1 L Lucretius) when I came across a book by Haridas Chaudhuri  The Philosophy of Love .  Anyway, I have found my champion of agapic love!!  Yay!!  He gives a neat theory that aliken love to life.  Just as life cannot be reduced to lower order mechanical biology (though living things can), love cannot be reduced, just happends and creates value.

       Typing Test   I just did a  urlLink typing test  to see how slow I am at typing one handed (with my right, primary, hand.)  - Test Name:   Strategic Alliances with Competitors - Date:        2004-03-04 11:03 - Test Time:   02:00 - Gross Speed: 36 WPM - Errors:      4  - Accuracy:    94%  - NET SPEED:   34 WPM  Is that good?  (I wish I knew what my speed two handed used to be...)  I could fudge my left hand results.  It would look like this:  - Test Name:   Strategic Alliances with Competitors - Date:        2004-03-04 11:09 - Test Time:   02:00 - Gross Speed: 0 WPM - Errors:      0  - Accuracy:    100%  - NET SPEED:   0 WPM  At least I wouldn't make any mistakes.  (I am supposed to be thinking positive right?)

       Course Work Subjects   I have to do two corse work subjects again this semester.  I am doing:  Animal Minds (Metaphysics and Epistemology)  Agency, Narrative, and Normativity (Value Theory)  Both are on Thursday.  I may never have to go to uni for more than a day a week again.  (Except that like Honours lunchies and Toby related thesis things are on Mondays, like last semester...)   Semester 1, Week 1, Day 4.   Read (going to read before class):  A chapter from Kim Sterelny, "Thought in a Hostile world"  Korsgaard, Christine. 1989. Personal Identity and the Unity of Agency: A Kantian Response to Parfit. Philosophy and Public Affairs, 18, 101-32.  Actually have a class today for Value Theory at 2pm.  Invention for the day: Infallible Printers with never ending paper that does not jam.

      Number of hands used to type this: 1. Number of brain cells used to type this: ?   Yesterday   Went to uni, got a Value Theory (one of my two corse work subjects) reading by Velleman.  Managed to get there (despite the persistant crush of over enthusiastic first years) before lunch and the department office closing.  Met up with Hannah and she gave me a lift to the physio.  The physio seemed pretty happy with my hand.  She said it will take some time.  Being able to lean on my hand could takes moths.  Goody.  Singing was okay.  We sang  For the Longest Time .  My part (alto) has several words.  Not only to we get to sing Woh, but also Oo, Ah and Boom.  Sounds a bit like sex really.  We also began work on  Who Wants to Live Forever  which we haven't done since 1996.  Scary.   Semester 1, Week 1, Day 3.   Read:  Velleman, J. David, 'Well-Being and Time',  The Possibilty of Practical Reason , Oxford University Press, 2000.  Brief summary:  Velleman thinks that the amount of well being experienced in moments (moment well-being) cannot bear any relationship to the amount of well-being experienced as a life.  No classes until tomorrow.  Hah!  Those 4 contact hours on a Thursday are a real strain.  Invention for the day: Some kind of slapping device that finds and slaps people who think that randomly initialising part of their name is a good thing.  Prime candidates should be C. S. Lewis, C. I. Lewis (philosopher, wrote  An Analysis of Knowledge and Valuation ), J. K. Rowling, J. R. R. Tolkien, Micheal J. Fox and George Bush Senior (for having a son and then naming his son after him).

      I have a plan!!!  After much emailing, nail biting and cups of tea, I have a plan for my thesis!  No longer will the blank white screen of death look upon me with its unseeing whiteness.  No, no, my friend, for I have a plan.  An outline.  A goal.  Something achievable.  Something solid, yet flexible.  Here it is:   My Thesis Plan   Introduction (500 words)  Responsive theories (1500 words)  Creative theories (1500 words)  Lucretius' theory and Thesis (2000 words)  Objections and Responses (2000 – 4000 words)  Conclusion (500 words)  Ain't that just lovely?  I just had to share it with you.  This may just be my new achievement for the day!

       Junked Introduction   This is an introduction to my thesis that I wrote yesterday when I was feeling a little miffed and had a small case of blank-screenophobia.  Enjoy!  It seems traditional, almost imperative, to begin any treatise on love with a cute quote from literature or philosophy.  Over the past year I have read many quotes and been unimpressed by all of them.  Each of them lacked something when talking about love.  They failed to encapsulate the many highs and lows of love as well as that settled feeling one gets from knowing one is loved.  Perhaps this demonstrated to me more clearly than any individual work on love that there are many aspects to it and it is difficult to capture.  One philosopher who also seemed to come to this conclusion was Lucretius, a Roman Epicurean who wrote in the first century B.C.E.  But none of the contemporary literature mentioned him at all.  They were all busy writing about Plato, Aristotle and St. Paul.  They were writing about whether love was in response to properties or created properties.  They were asserting that it was very silly anyway, because how could it be that someone was in love with a property and not a person.  They wrote about how love started and how love continued.  And if it got too much for them, well, they wrote that it wasn’t really love after all.  Lucretius wrote about all these things, but he has been traditionally condemned as a mad, bitter man who wrote in his lucid moments before committing suicide over a failed love affair.  My thesis then, aims to show why all these philosophers are talking about all these issues to cross-purposes so that, hopefully, no one will ever have to write another treatise on love that starts with a cute quote again!  (But I'm not bitter.  These are the views of Ainsley, who has been scorned as a mad, bitter woman...)

      Well, at least Lucretius is dead and doesn't have a home page.  I have been mentioning Alan Soble to people every now and again.  I admire and respect this guys work on the philosophy of love.  But check out this picture that was on his home page!!   urlLink Cacti.jpg   I am not sure if the large ones or the flowering ones disturb me more.

      Here it is.  For all the world to see.  A snipet out of what I've been writing that sums it all up:   My Thesis  Lucretius theory of love encapsulates both the responsive and creative theories by acknowledging that the two camps are discussing two different aspects of love and are at cross-purposes.  Lucretius explores responsive love and shows how it can be sustained.  He also explores creative love and shows how it begins.  By acknowledging the two aspects of love in his theory, Lucretius can explain not only how love begins and endures, but also why there are two camps of philosophers who disagree.   What I have read/re-read:  Delaney, Neil, ‘Romantic Love and Loving Commitment : Articulating a Modern Ideal’,  American Philosophical Quarterly , Vol. 33, No. 4, 1996, p 339-356.  Keller, Simon, ‘How do I Love Thee?  Let me Count the Properties’,  American Philosophical Quarterly , Vol. 37, No. 2, 2000, p 163-173.  Nozick, Robert, 'Love's Bond',  The Examined Life , Simon and Schuster, 1989.  (The honours co-ordinator, Toby, wants to meet with me to discuss my progress and any concerns/problems I might be having with my first draft.  I told him:  Concerns for a first draft are mostly to do with my continuing one-handed typist state. However, I also just need to get my ideas (of which I have many) and thoughts out (this is hampered by my slow and tedious typing).)

      She's writing again...   Semester 1, Week 1, Day 1   Had terrible dreams about uni and a ball room dress.  I couldn't find a necklace to go with it.  Went to uni, it was very busy.  Sat in korner for a bit, it was very busy.  Went to the library to attempt to find a champion of agapic love (I already have several contemporary champions of erosic love, I just want someone who doesn't have Paul in his name, i.e. St Paul or Pope John Paul.  Someone who wrote after 1900 would also be a bonus), it wasn't busy at all.  Yay.  Found one guy, but he seemed to be a loony.  Went and met nervous looking other honours students.  Amy (psycho Law/Arts student) said that she had Law summer subjects.  She asked if I worked much over summer.  I announced proudly to the room that I spent most of the summer in a darkened room snoozing after I broke my arm on Boxing Day.  Another fine start to the semester.  Came back here and have written 150 words on thesis.  Joy.  This is my twelfth semester.  David W has been at uni longer than I (but I don't have 6 minors.)

      Mood: Improving. Thesis: 2500 words.  Informal Topic, but no introduction.  Neat Quote from  The West Wing :  President: You know, Zoey is starting Georgetown in two weeks, I was thinking about getting her "The Nature of Things," translated from the Latin of Titus Lucretius Carus. What do you think?   Charlie: I think she would like that better than a new stereo, sir.  (This is what happens when you start typing your name and your fave philosopher into google.)   Recently   Went to doctors.  Having physio to see if I can get enough movement to not have surgery.  Arm improving.  Helped Benji cook last night.    Still one handed typist.  Still no driving, cycling or piano.  Went with Jeans and helped her buy a bike, it's a black Giant Boulder SE.  Went to her birthday party and stayed for more than four hours!!  Invention for the day: Leather boots that can determine if you are wearing socks or stockings and shrink/grow appropriately.  I have sore toes now.

      I was going to have an appointment with the DLU, but when I finally decided to listen to my voice messages turns out my appointment was cancelled.  Now seeing someone at 10:00 tomorrow.  This will get me out of the house.  I don't think I like the term "disabled", I think I prefer "brutally mutilated".   Semester 1, Week 2, Day 4.   About to have classes, both of them!    Could go to the graduate jobs fair, but it sounds way depressing.  Besides, who'd want to hire someone who's brutally mutilated anyway?  Invention for the day: Voice mail filtering that lets you know who called and if it's something you should actually listen to.

      Still haven't decided on my party.  Think I'll cancel due to lack of interest... my interest.   Semester 1, Week 2, Day 3.     Passions  wasn't on this morning.  It must have been a programming anomaly.  Wrote some stuff on Creative Love.  Mooshed together an introduction and managed to ambush Dirk into seeing me for a bit.  I handed over my writings.  I am meeting him next Wednesday at 11:00, but he said he'd email me stuff sooner.  I am meeting Benji at Chadstone (the Fashion Capital) at 4:30.  I have to find that letter from my doctor for the DLU before tomorrow morning... sigh.  Invention for the day: Indexed Room Inventory Technology that makes physical searching like looking through paper yellow pages.

       Yesterday.   Still haven't decided on my party.  Went down to the beach at the end of Warrigal Road.  It was cold and windy.  Panicked (cried) at Benji about Honours and my continued lack of typing.  Very depressing.  Feel very useless sometimes.  It's the little things that no-one tells you about it that get me.  Like all the pink bits on your palm and fingers are callouses and when you don't use it for a bit it all washes away in huge clumps and then your hand is really sensitive when you use it again.  On the plus side, I can use my hand to hold shampoo again.   Semester 1, Week 2, Day 2.   Victory Wiggle for the day: Did up my bra from behind for the first time this year.  Still haven't decided on my party.  According to the scales I have gained a bit of weight (less than 10% of my previous weight, but not much less.)  Not really surprised seeing I have been doing almost zero exercise and eating a fair bit.  I can now watch the plot in  Passions  progress twice as fast.  Discovered it is on at 9:30 (instead of  Ricky ) and at its usual 3:00 spot.  Timmy is still around and the scroll projected a hologram Charity which told him to use the Book of Spells to help free Charity from the ice.  Meanwhile, Zombie Charity has decided to sleep with Migall (or whatever his name is) who was going out with Charity until she was trapped in ice, even though Kay (who is trying to get Migall and invoked Zombie Charity in the first place) doesn't want her to.  Also it turns out that Julian died and they're after his murderer.  Tabitha (the witch who created Timmy as a doll before he turned into a real boy on a Christmas wish) and Timmy were burned by Julian's ancestor because she was a witch so Tabitha cursed his family.  Theresa (who Julian got drunk in Bermuda and slept with her and married her and knocked her up) is trying to get Ethan back by inheriting all of Julians money by claiming to be the only Mrs Julian Crane - but she is only doing that because Zombie Charity keeps turning into Julian and persuading her to.  Her mum doesn't want her to take the money because its cursed.  Also did some shopping... bought a lot of thesis writing food (hot cross buns, fruche and m&ms.)  This should contribute nicely to making it fully up to 10%.  Set up the laptop in the lounge room.  Rewrote my Responsive Love section on my thesis and began reworking Creative Love, but it still seems kinda stupid.  Invention for the day: TV Guide that warned if there was  any  plot development in a soapy episode so you know to watch it.

       Semester 1, Week 2, Day 1.   Went and saw a counsellor at Monash Uni.  Everyone seems to think that voice recognition software is the way to go....  He recommended I register with the Disability Liason Unit.  So I went to try and do that, but I have to have something filled out by my doctor.  (Now as fun as paying $45 so my doctor can fill out form sounds, I decided to see if I could get out of this requirement.)  Sigh.  I have an appointment for Thursday anyway... I anticpate playing my stupid card.  "Oh, but isn't this letter enough?"  I booked Benji and I into Beginners Italian - a short course at Monash.  I figured it would be fun to start to learn another romance language that's similar to Latin...  (and Benji just wanted to learn Italian.)  Then walked back to Benji's place.  Opened up my thesis documents, closed them.  Attempted to snooze.  Walked back to uni.  Made appointment to have hair cut.  Went to philosophy lunchies.  Sat at looked knowledgable.  Spat out epic tale of broken arm.  Went and had hair cut.  No one will notice - but feel free to pretend.    Went and negotiated deadlines with Toby.  Here they are:  Monday Week 07 17/4 - Draft Thesis Monday Week 10 10/5 - Oral Presentation Monday Week 13 31/5 - Final Draft Monday Week 15 14/6 - Essays  He asked if I wanted to just push the whole lot back until next semester, but I said I was funding myself, couldn't work and would kind of like for it to be over.  Walked back to Benji's.  Plans for the rest of the day: Food.  Go to beach with Benji.  He insists.  Invention for the day: A liitle dust buster like device that is powerful enough to pick up hair, but not so powerful as to attempt to swallow your clothes.  I am covered in snippets.

       Creative Love   Creative love theorists consider that love creates value in the beloved.  (I think that this means that they either go straight for value, they make up reasons/properties or they don't think that properties are important.)   The Rest Of Friday   Ended up writing a bit on Creative Love after I got jack of writing about Responsive Love.  Went to Jeans place, had dinner and picked on Janeway's hair.  As predicted.     Saturday   Slept in.  Glorious.  Benji and I went to the Organ Pipes National Park (which is opposite Caulder Park Raceway).  Steep but shot walk to see lava in specky formation.  Lots of fun, but perhaps not worth the drive.  Attempted to drive around the car park at the National Park.  This proved a) difficult and b) painful.  Couldn't stick it in reverse at all (involves lifting a small knob on the gear stick) and although shifting up was okay, shifting down hurt.  Steering was somewhat precarious too.  Moped about my continued uselessness.  Had mad thoughts about buying a cheap auto, does seem rather silly though.  Benji and I have been playing a lot of chess lately.  He is a superior player, and although I am improving, he is much more familiar with things like forcing the king to step back into a corner.   Sunday   Although not mentioned on previous blog entries, Benji and I have been going to church on Sundays since the beginning of the year (except when we've been at Toora.)  Went to Chadstone the Fashion Capital and Benji had his hair cut and bought some ear phones.  He thinks that this will mean that he can play more computer games.  Ha!  Sat around this afternoon and played chess.  I took Benji's queen in an act of severe stupidity on his part in one of the games.  Did teeny bit of work on thesis.  Invention for the day: Small invisible leprechaun that sits on my shoulder and tells me whenever I'm about to make a stupid move in chess.

      Soon I will be 9497 days old (26 x 265 + 7)....  For some reason this is cause for celebration.  I realised that the last time my birthday was on a Saturday was when I turned 21 - I wasn't working then either.  I have come a long way, including having four birthdays at the same company (which had four different names....)  I am not really worried about getting older.  I think this is what happens to people who are unhappy with what they've achieved.  Some of what I have achieved (in no particular order):  Survived this long. Lived in a different state from the one I was born in. Lived in the country. Lived in a city. Learnt to drive. VCE. Graduated Bachelor of Computer Science. Fallen in love. Had my heart broken and recovered. Got into honours, twice. Started to learn Spanish, German, Mandarin and Ancient Greek (and now Italian). Been as far west as Perth and as far north as Bundaberg (have not been overseas). A bunch of kinky stuff that I shan't publish. Been so drunk that I considered not lifting my head to vomit. I have been concussed on numerous occasions (and only once because of David). Broken my colar bone (this is an achievement). Ridden more that 600km in nine days. Driven more that 6000km in two weeks by myself. Driven more than 12000km in twelve days with company. Rode a motorbike (for a bit) but then broke my arm. Learnt to ride a horse and galloped on a big white one along a beach. Moved out of home. Moved from Baronia Crescent, to York Ave, to Newlands Drive, to Barker Street, to Lillimur Road, to Dandenong Road, to Murdo Road, to Evelyn Street, to Panorama Street, to Greta Street, to Barkly Street, to Charles Street to my current street.  Yeah! Worked and studied. Was fired with 1.5 hours notice. Earnt more than my parents income combined. Earnt nothing. Discovered who I was, but then lost it and rediscovered who I was. Discovered who I was and decided I liked it.  So all in all, I've no cause to complain.

      Number of sleeps until my birthday: 1.   Semester 1, Week 3, Day 5.    Ciao.  Che lingua parli?  No parlo italiano.  Banged my brain against thesis all day.  Except for the bits where good tv was on.  Ooh, in  Passions  Theresa thinks she's found a way to trick the devil so she can get Ethan back without having to do what he wants.  At the end of the episode she's talking to Whitney (who is possibly more wet than Winoda Ryder, though its a pretty tough competition) two eyes appear (ala  Trapdoor ) to come and take her down to hell... again!  Anyway, I have given up on this whole Responsive and Creative Love stuff.  My current terms are Sploosh and Moosh - this way I can call them something need later.  Sploosh theory is based on idea that people's value is dependant on their properties. Moosh theroy is based on the idea that people have innate value.  Going to Mexican restaurant soon to have dinner with parents for birthday.  Benji said he'd dress up... I'll let you know. :)  Ciao.  Invention for the day:  A useful thesaurus for Microsoft Word.

      Yesterday's midday movie was  First Do No Harm , about an epileptic boy who was mistreated and managed to become drug and seizure free by going on a fatty diet.  It had Meryl Streep in it.  Yesterday Benji and I went to Los Nachos Expensivos and had a lovely meal.   Semester 1, Week 3, Day 4.    Fourth month anniversary of Benji and I.  Phew, dead tired.  First went to uni and printed out Animal Minds presentation.  Then gave presentation (went well).  Then had some lunch.  Then went to Value Theory and pretended to have read the paper recently (read it a while ago).  Began to bang brain in serious manner over thesis and Creative Love.  Not sure what I shall call it in the future.  Then started short course, which was long.  Benji and I have started learning Italian.  Scary.  Ciao.  Mi chiamo Ainsley.  Came back to Benji's place to blog.  He surprised me with flowers.  Very sweet.  Invention for the day: Some kind of destruct mechanism that destroys fellow students who decide that they are determined to drag the lecturer way of course and turn the seminar into some kind of personal tutorial.

       Semester 1, Week 3, Day 3.    Number of Snoozes: 0 - but the day is young.  Number of Hands used to type this: 2, mostly.  (Yay!!)  If I go home now, I may catch some of the midday movie.  Spent this morning looking at the comments Dirk sent which I finally received today.  Then went and spent an hour racking my brain with Dirk over this whole Creative Love stuff.  We considered calling it Fictional Love for a while.  I asked if that was a loaded term.  Dirk said that was the point.  I am meeting him again next Tuesday at 2:00.  Now have grabbed some foodies and about to go home.  Plans for the rest of the day include:  Finalising nasty Animal Minds presentation notes for tomorrow.  It would be nice if I understood what it is this guy is trying to achieve.  He just seems to blither on indefinately about bees, bats and cuckoos.  (Maybe he's obessed with the birds and bees and a bit cuckoo himself, but this theory does not explain the bats.)  Should probably re-read papers for tomorrow's Value Theory class too.  Then what?  Oh yes.  If I have any time left will bang brain against Creative Love some more.  I've got this great article by Velleman called  Love as a Moral Emotion  where he explores the idea that love is immoral because it requires us to discriminate against persons, but we should treat everyone equally.  I felt better about this article when Dirk said it was a tough one.  There is a lot going on in it.  Sigh.  My thesis is very bony at the moment (needs a lot of fleshing out) and there are a couple of issues that I need to address.  Like, I'm not going to say what love is exactly, however I do think it is a semi-intentional emotion.  I am also not going to blither on about how romantic/erotic love is different from other kinds of love.  I think it safe to use the term and that people kinda get what I am talking about.  Invention for the day: Actually, what I'd like is this counter thing around the uni that lists the computer labs and how many free pcs are available in each one.  (Like  Crown  does with its parking.)  It's always a bit chancy coming down to the Arts basement (well, during the middle of the day anyway).  Eventually the little first years are going to discover it's here.  Doom.

       Semester 1, Week 3, Day 2.   Number of Snoozes: 0  This was achieved primarily by sleeping in until 11:45.  I accidently watched some of the midday movie.  It was  Vanished without a Trace .  I missed  Passions , but I saw some of it in the physio's waiting room.  I am amazed by some people who fail to grasp that if a public toilet door doesn't open, then maybe, just maybe there is someone in there.  She also failed to grasp that there was a queue, and consequentially I missed the penultimate bus to the physio and arrived with only minutes to spare, as opposed to about 15.  I also decided that a bus filled with school children is a scary sight.  I used to be one of those.  Scarier.  Did nothing.  Singing was okay.  Got told off for blogging instead of talking to my friends.  Sung  Who Wants to Live Forever .  Just got mocked for reading out my blog to my friends.  Invention for the day: Anti-boredom device that suggests things that you will actually want to do.

       Semester 1, Week 3, Day 1.   Worked/completed presentation for Animal Minds.  Blurk.  Sat and watched a lot of tv.  In  Passions ....  Kay was casting a spell to destroy the Zombie Charity, and bits of ZC were disappearing (bad, bad CGI).  ZC appeared before Kay and stopped Kay from casting the spell.  Timmy was going to stop Kay first, but Tabitha stopped him because "all hell would brake loose."  Anyway, when ZC stopped Kay, the house shook and there was a lot of wind and leaves rushing around.  So Kay undid the spell she was half way through casting.  I only watched a bit of it.  The other plots today were even more tedious.  Amost finished my packet of m&ms, it was a big packet.  Invention for the day: Small injection containing social clues.

       Classes on Thursday.   Classes were good, though it proved to be a long day.  I questioned my wisdom of having all of my classes on the same day (all two of them...)  Animal Minds, I volunteered to present the readings for next week (get it over with).  Value Theory, well, I had read the article, even if no one else had.   Semester 1, Week 2, Day 5.    Went to the DLU - I am now officially disabled.  The guy was really nice to me and said that I didn't need any more documentation the stuff I had already.  Then he wrote me a letter and gave me several copies and told me to go and apply for a weeks extension. So I went and saw Toby and he said I could have a weeks extension, but we are still going to treat the original due date as is - but I can have the extension as soon as I ask for it (psychological thing.)  Went home, spent a lot of time on the couch watching  Blackadder II  and sleeping.  Did some work on a presentation I have to do for Animal Minds.  Friday night, went swimming.  I did a whole 8 laps (where a lap is "there", and another lap is "back") before giving up and going into the spa.  Went and had dinner with swimmy folk and I had a drink spilt down the back of my jacket, which I'd just put on.   Saturday.   Slept in.  Played chess and generally chatted to Benji.  Spent the afternoon reading and dying hair.  Went to Avril's place for dinner and then onto David's birthday party.  Had a good time, which was a bit surprised at, though I did drink four bicardis.   Sunday.   Blurk.  Spent a significant part of the morning in pain and shivering from the bicardis.  Didn't make it to church.  Went for a walk after some breakfast, I've just been playing  Dungeon Keeper II  and next Benji and I are going grocery shopping (we know how to live.)  Invention for the day: Star Trek like diagnostic device that tells you in advance how much water you should drink before going to bed really drunk.

      Number of days until my thesis draft is due: 24.   Semester 1, Week 4, Day 5.    Spent the morning watching tv - had a headache.  One can watch channel 7 all morning and not have to flick.  9:30  Ricki  (1800 episodes edition which included hootchie mammas) 10:30  Morning News  11:00  Living with Bonnie  adequate sitcom about a morning show hostess and her insane family 11:30  Yes Dear   quite funny sitcom about two couples who's husbands are quite different  Then there's the midday movie, which point the Nurafen stuck in and I worked on my thesis until I got jack of it about about 5:00.  My folks came over and gave me my birthday present (I ended up asking for a new Melways.)  I asked for a large print lard cover and got a small print soft cover.  Sigh.  Went to Benji's place, dinner, coffee and chess.  Then sleep.  Invention for the day: Virtual laptop - don't have to put it on the coffee table to get up and go to the loo.  Very important.

       Animal Minds   Was good.  We didn't get to the second article so I was spared.  Can read it for next week.    We talked about beliefs a lot.  Beliefs are supposed to be necessary for a mind.  Davidson thinks that beliefs about beliefs are necessary for a mind (and necessary for beliefs, if you have beliefs you must have beliefs about beliefs...) and that beliefs (as they are abstract) can only be represented through language.  I guess autistic people don't have minds....   Value Theory   Was interupted by the stinky students protesting about the Monash 25% increase in fees.  After we evacuated the Ming Wing and went back up, had lovely discussion about how our life story is not just historical note taking but also provides reasons for action (based on yet another paper by Velleman...) by you committing to something.  Whe puttering about the office, I say "I am going home now." and this will help make it true.  This week should be good because I don't have anything new to read (apart from the second article in Animal Minds and Davidson).  For Value Theory we need to think about how our conception of agency gives rise to reasons for action.  Sigh.  There is only two of us in the class and a lurker (who does speak) so I will have to have something to say.  Think I'll go scavenge some food before Italiano at 6:30.  (The homework went well, though my conversations were dead boring.  That reminds me, I meant to write up my conversations properly.  Will do so, after food.)

      Number of days until my thesis draft is due: 25.    Semester 1, Week 4, Day 4.    Classes today.  I am printing out one of the articles for Value Theory.  Discovered the printer works better if I take the cover off (it is having trouble sucking up the paper) but I need to supervise it to make sure it doesn't re-suck what it just printed on.  Which is less frustrating for some reason that it printing a few sheets and then going offline.  As soon as it finishes printing I will go to uni, get some food, go to class.  I need to read the second article for Animals Minds still, but I don't think it will happen before class.  Number of words I anticipate writing on my thesis today: 0.  But this isn't too detrimental because I was very productive yesterday.  My thesis is looking so much healthier and I still have many ideas that need to go in it and many connections to draw (write about.)    Oops, just got distracted my blog and had to rescue a bit of paper, sacrificing two pages in the process.  I don't understand printers.  Disgruntled creatures.  I guess I'll let you know how classes go after I have them...  Invention for the day: Toothpaste that doubles as lip balm.

      Number of days until my thesis draft is due: 26.    Semester 1, Week 4, Day 3.    Woke up in state of panic.  Realised that if I wrote 500 words a day I should have about 13,000 words (which would mean I had chucked some, but chucking is inevitable at this point.)  Then realised that I was not going to work on it every single day (like Thursdays when I have classes and some days on the weekend), which means that I will have to write more words on some days to make up for it.  Finally realised that this was stupid, as already have a fair few words written (about 6 days worth) and could easily write 1500 words in a day if nothing else on and I've done the reading.  Spent the entire day writing my thesis (okay, I spent from 9:00 until 4:30 writing my thesis and I stopped at various stages to a) get a drink b) go to the loo from too many drinks or c) go to my room and bring out yet another book.   At some point around 11:30 I had toasted muffins with jam.)  Thesis is coming along okay.  It's coming together after my panic subsided.  Wrote a little Excel sheet to simulate what kind of marks I need to get an H1.  If I get 70% on my essays, I must get 90% on my thesis... that sort of thing.  Doing Italian homework now for class tomorrow.  So stuffed.  This is probably the most productive day I've had all year.  Invention for the day:  Small robot for getting books and drinks so I don't have to shift the laptop and go myself.  Will continue to go to the loo unassisted though.

      WARNING:  This entry contains philosophy.   Semester 1, Week 4, Day 2.   Stiff neck and legs from nasty aerobics.  Spent the morning reading Value Theory articles.    Have just come back from meeting with Dirk.  He seemed happy with my change in direction.  I have changed it from being “Lucretius is the avatar of love” to being something more along the lines of "Lucretius believes the sploosh account of love, which is wholly consistent with his metaphysics.  People who criticise him are moosh theorists, including  urlLink Nussbaum ."   Anyway we chatted a lot about the difference between Lucretius' two accounts of love and the  urlLink Keller  (sploosh) and  urlLink Velleman  (moosh) accounts of love.    (From Friday: Sploosh theory is based on idea that people's value is dependant on their properties. Moosh theroy is based on the idea that people have innate value. )  But Velleman considers that the innate value that people have is based on their manifest person (or personhood) which can be roughly translated as "their capacity to do good stuff."  People are embodied personhoods (they are "personhoods" surrounded by this flesh and blood stuff and behaviour).  The selectivity of love is then explained by Velleman as people not always being able to "see" or "encounter" someone's personhood (or "true self") as our behaviour and interpretation is not always perfect.  The difference (advantage/disadvantge) between sploosh and moosh accounts of love then seems to be as follows:  In the sploosh account (properties, responsive) the  cause  of the love is also the  justification  (i.e. properties in both cases). In the moosh account (value, creative) the  cause  of the love is different from the  justification  (i.e. access to personhood and personhood.)  So in the case where John loves Mary:  Sploosh says that John is caused to love Mary because she has Property P and Property P is sufficient to explain his love. Moosh says that John is caused to love Mary because she and he have some Property P and that her innate value is sufficient to explain his love.  (Property P can be any relevant property of Mary - that she has a neat sense of humour, saved John from being run over by a tram or picks her nose in a very attractive way...  typically we would think that Property P would be a bunch of properties rather than a particular single property.)  As I was writing this I was thinking that:  Moosh says that John is caused to love Mary because he has access to her innate value and that her innate value is sufficient to explain his love (which would make the cause and justification the same.)  BUT the whole think about selectivity is that the "access to her innate value" must still be explained.    Nussbaum:  Nussbaum wrote this lovely essay where she goes on about how great Lucretius' love theory is, "Beyond obsession and disgust".   But at the end, she says that he must be mistaken.  Sigh.  Anyway, I said that reckon she is probably a big moosh theorist because she really prefers the Stoics.  So here's the thing:  Lucretius is an Epicurean Epicurus and the Stoics were two competing Hellenistic schools of philosophy in Athens.  (The Stoics hung around the Stoa (market place) - like korner.  Roman proponents include Cicero and Seneca, they didn't hang around the stoa.) Nussbaum is a big Stoic proponent Velleman thinks Nussbaum is pretty alright (see note 101 in his article "Love as a Moral Emotion") Velleman thinks that Kant is pretty alright too Kant is a Stoic.  Damn Stoics get everywhere!   (Oh, also from Friday.  Benji dressed up and looked wonderful.  I then suggested he was a little over dressed.  He wore shoes that weren't sandles and everything!)  What else happened...  Oh yes.  We discussed masters and stuff.  (Masters is what you do after honours, it's a 18 month - 2 year research thing.)   I need to get a first class (H1, 80%+) if I want to get a scholarship (plus have good undergrad marks, plus have a really decent and exciting proposal...)  Blurk.  I would think this was achievable but I really knackered up the Aesthetics essay last semester (i.e got less than 75% for it.)  So what happens now?  I work my butt off trying to make up for last semester with a wicked thesis and really good Animal Minds and Value Theory essays.  (You can get into Masters with an H2A (75-79%), but you won't be eligible for a scholarship.  Your options are to work (possibly as a tutor in philosophy) to pay your way and decided if you want to go part time.)  We talked about my Aesthetics essay (Dirk was the second marker.)  He said I was very creative (something to the affect of one of the most creative students he'd encountered in a while) but that my biggest weakness was not dotting i's and crossing t's in my work.  My thesis is going to require A LOT of polishing.  But (as I said to him) I hate writing - it's the ideas I'm interested in.  Not the rigorous arguments for making them work.  Well, partly that too, but not actually WRITING about them.  So, anyway, I have decided to really work at this and pull my finger out as much as possible (which is why I'm blogging...).  It seems to me that I don't hate writing that much (as I am here, blogging away) but that when I write an essay my "writing spirit" or "writing voice" just dries up into this dead, boring lecturer spirit.  I wish I had a lovely chatty essay writing style like David Lewis (who is great to read) instead of sounding like Aristotle (who seems to have written lecture notes that one of his students knabbed from his paper recycling bin, often after the shredder) or Kant (who seems to have put a thesaurus through his work which replaces all the short, easy words with difficult, underfined terms).  Maybe I need to change the way I think about writing my essays.  I could make it more chatty and refer to myself - but that seems unprofessional.  Yet, many journal articles I've read (including my lecturers') have lots of "I think" "we will show" and "my" in them.  I think it's obvious that I'm not inarticulate (judging from this rant anyway) but I think my brain dies when I go to write an essay.  Maybe I should write my thesis in blog form....  (Hey, Plato wrote his philosophy in play form!  Like it's not hard enough to extract what he's thinking.  If he had been a bit more straight, all the rest of philosophy wouldn't have to be his damn footnotes.)  How does one find the balance between "chatty" and "professional".  Maybe I should read some chatty journal articles and attempt to emulate their style (or adjust it to work for me.)  Well, that's my Agony Aunt session for the day.  (If anyone has some advice on this (or knows of a book that has advice), please email me.)  Singing tonight, then sleep.

      Number of days until my thesis draft is due:  27.  Big congrats to Bowie and Katie!   Saturday.   Twas my birthday.  Spent most of the day sitting around the house being miserable.  Had a dinner with some folks and then cake and coffee at Jeanie's.  It was pretty nice.   Sunday.   Went to church in the morning.  Spent the afternoon working on my thesis.  Wrote 1000 words.  Had pancakes by candle light (the fluro globe in my kitchen has gone and we haven't replaced it.)   Semester 1, Week 4, Day 1.    Weekly panic regarding length of time until thesis is due.  Spent most of the morning chatting to Hannah about life, the universe and everything.  Spent most of the afternoon looking blankly at my thesis.  Wrote 300 words, mostly idea words... (i.e. not actual thesis text.)  Went to aerobics.  Almost died.  My left arm is weaker than my right (funnily enough.)  Came home and mooched until I fell asleep in a small heap.  Lost a game of chess.  Invention for the day: Instant body evener that will make one side of your body the same as the other side, only mirrored obviously.  Not for use on the torso (unless you're Dr Who and have two hearts or something.)

      Number of days until thesis draft is due: 17.   Semester 1, Week 5, Day 5.   How?  How can it be the end of week 5???  I haven't done anything yet.  I feel my week is divided into two halves, the bit where I do work and the bit where I stress that Dirk hasn't read my draft yet.  Today I did some domestic chores and some thesis type stuff.  In the middle of all of this, I went and caught up with Jeanie and she fed me a rather yummy lunch.  I attempted to bash out a conclusion....  I am finding it harder and harder to think about my thesis and to really work on it.  I feel it is more like an unstable block construction that I can't change too many blocks of, otherwise it will fall over.  I think it already has fallen over, but if I just add a few more blocks it will be much more stable when I re-build.  Sigh.  Still sitting at about 7600 words (it needs to be 8,000-10,000), but there's no danger of not making the word limit.  I forgot to mention, I came up with names for my two accounts:  Merit = sploosh (property based value) Dignity = moosh (innate "true self" value)  Yay me!   What I need to be able to do is to poke holes in the piece as a whoel, so I know where to sure it up.  I am having trouble thinking about it.  I have thoughts, but the seem slippery and fleeting (and rather unformed.)  Brain hurts.  In other news: Kidding.  There is only thesis.  Tomorrow we pick up Benji's new car.  Invention for the day: Auto thesis checker that pokes holes in arguments.

      Number of days until thesis draft is due: 18. Number of other honours students who were a little freaked out when I told them their synopsis was due in 18 days: 4.   Semester 1, Week 5, Day 4.   Slept in, glorious.  Classes today.  Animal Minds - Discussed the difference between preferences and drives.     Value Theory - Discussed a paper that aimed to diss the "combat view" of motivation (beliefs vs desires) and replace with Kant/Plato's three element version.  Went and had dinner and Benji's.  Italiano - Learned 0-100, seasons, months and some professions.  Fraccio la studentessa.  Come back to Benji's place to check email and blog.  In between all of that, I had printed out my thesis yesterday (which Benji went over.)  Today I went over it myself and began to really think about some of what I'm saying and edit/polish it.  I'd forgotten how much of a difference printing the thing out and having it stare at you makes.  A girlie from class wants me to email her a draft (which I am fairly happy to do).  But I thought I'd clean it up a little first.  I will want people to read it in about a week, I think.  (Please email me if you want a copy, preferably if you want to edit a copy....)  Invention for the day: Instant peer review - just add water.

      Number of days until thesis draft is due: 19.    Semester 1, Week 5, Day 3.    Thesis thesis thesis...  Started adding in real footnotes and such.  Came up with an argument against Nussbaum.  Removed the bit on Epicurean Metaphysics and Female Desire.  Started to have a go at rigour.... decided I hated my thesis and that I had no idea why I was doing this stupid honours thing anyway.  Watched a lot of tv and ate a lot of m&ms.  (Some piano played.)  Tonight, Italian homework.  Invention for the day: Thesis polisher and m&m colour sorter.  (I ate all the yellow ones, then all the orange ones, then all the brown ones... Benji came and ate indiscriminately of the green, red and blue ones.)

       Meeting with Dirk.   WARNING: This entry contains philosophy.   I just had my weekly meeting with Dirk regarding my thesis.  He said that I was making some strong claims that needed to be backed up with strong arguments and not just handwaving.  He said that I needed to polish and fill in the  urlLink exegesis .  (I now even know what "exegesis" means... "text").  Finally he said I needed to use formal prose and be careful.  Sigh.  Just when I thought the chatty approach would work.  Plus footnotes, bibliography etc.    I think this reveals horrific structural problems with my thesis, not at the top level, at the mid level.  Like I split up my Moosh account of love into a number of sections rather than either a) going through Velleman's paper or b) summarising Velleman in a way that has like a causal story.  Once again I have changed the general kind of story I am trying to tell.  (For my previous version see March 23.) Rather than suggest that Nussbaum disagrees with Lucretius because she is a moosh theorist (rather difficult to prove) I want to suggest that Nussbaum disagrees with Lucretius because she thinks that there is only one theory of love and that Lucretius has taken all the good bits out and left a hollow shell of boredom and "will governed friendship."   I think there are (at least) two theories of love and Lucretius favours one over the other.  (This is so much easier in blog form.)  I had written some stuff on Female Desire and Epicurean Metaphysics, but I am going to chuck them.  (That's 670 more words to play with.)  I am meeting Dirk next Wednesday and (luckily) he is available during the Easter break too.  (Phew!)  I have physio next Tuesday, but I should have my car by then.  Yay!  (I have been lending it to Benji for work.)  So, in summary, I think I have oodles of work to do.  Sigh.  Tasks:  A - See if I can get my Nussbaum theory to work, ditch otherwise (some changes in introduction required) B - Polish and fill in exegesis.  Otherwise Dirk is going to smack me around big time (if I don't polish well).  He is pretty tolerant to put up with me really.  (Though when I spoke to him, he was in the middle of marking the first year expository exercises.  With any luck I looked positively brilliant next to them.)  He said something like "This time" refering in opposition to the Aesthetics Essay "you will lay things out fully...."  Doom.  (I'm blithering... it's like gibbering, only more intent on purpose.)  I don't know why I find this so daunting.  Probably because I am convinced I'm crappy at it.  (I have written what the moosh and sploosh accounts of love are like at least seven times already.)  Non Thesis Related Tasks:  A - Singing (tonight) B - Italian Homework (tomorrow) C - Classes (done reading) - (nup turns out there is a new Value Theory paper to read) D - Italian class E - Pick up car (saturday)  Fun stuff to look forward to:  A - Polly's party (she is graduating on Thursday, party Saturday.)  So, things should be okay.  (Lot's of time.)  Eeek.

      Number of days until you know what: 20.  Amount of denial that Ainsley is in:  LOTS!   Sunday cont.   Went to Chadstone the Fashion Captial, bought Benji a pair of sneakers.  They're white.  Did stuff at Benji's place, played chess, dinner, sleep.   Semester 1, Week 5, Day 1.   It rained!  Got a lift home from Benji in the morning.  Sat around and watched tv all day feeling miserable and head-achy.  Really stiff muscles in neck and back.  Things were so bad I ended up watching  Judge Judy .  Did manage to read the Animal Minds reading for Thursday though.  Spent more than an hour in the bath and my toes went very prune like.    Benji came around and we got pizza.  Watched  The Princess Bride  on DVD.   Semester 1, Week 5, Day 2.   Woke up with head ache continuing.  Neurofen, deep heat (on neck and NOT sunburnt shoulders) and shower later and I still don't feel that amazing (actually I felt so unamazing this morning that I threw up in the shower.  Very clean.)  Caught the 703 to Syndal Station.  There I met a lady who is plugging Science Works.  She goes all over Melbourne to libraries and drops off little pamphlets fo their exhibitions.  She thought that Syndal was a lovely area.  It is, I guess.  Or it would be if the suburb still existed.  It's really just the fringes of Mt Waverly and Glen Waverly.  Caught the train (where the lady sat next to me, prattling on some more) to Glen Waverly.  Visited  urlLink mecu , my credit union (who are ace - I have gotten various members of the social group on to them.  If you're sick of being treated badly by fascist banks, I'd go to them.)  Did stuff.  Wandered around the Glen looking at the Beige Generation (the ones who came just before the Baby Boomers, as far as I can tell.)  Caught the 737 from Glen Waverley to Monash and started to blog....  Invention for the day: Deep heat that can be put on abrased or sunburnt skin.

      Number of days until my thesis draft is due: 22.   Saturday.   Had a glorious sleep in until about 9:30.  Went to  urlLink Car City  and looked at cars for Benji.  Walked around and around and around.  I ended up a little sunburnt.  We test drove two cars (I got to drive too.)  And now Benji is the proud owner of a new Ford Falcon Futura (it's a silver wagon).  It is the same price as the other one we test drove, with half the clicks and a year later, so we were pretty chuffed.  Went to Emily's place for Kellie's birthday dinner, which was very lovely.   Sunday.   Don't really know yet.  Slept in.  Probably going to Chastone The Fashion Capital to buy Benji a pair of sneakers....  I'll let you know. :)  Invention for the day: Additional detachable stomachs that allow you to eat a lot, but can then be disposed of.  Also helps as a dieting aid.

       Good Friday.   Did not do much this morning.  Packed a little.  This afternoon, saw  Ben Hur  at the Astor with Benji, Jeanie, Matt and Damien.  It was most excellent.  About to have dinner with said folks and then go to the farm (Benji's folks) for a couple of days over Easter.  Have been told my numerous people not to break anything.  I shall try.  Invention for the day: Curtains that open quicker after intermission.  Digital clock at back of cinemas that indicate time left until either intermission or end of movie.

       Semester 1, Week 6, Day 4.   Went to the travel agent and paid for our flights to Cairnes!  Defended the idea that Davidson was talking bollocks in Animal Minds.  Lunch with Jeanie at Wholefoods.  My afternoon class was cancelled, we went to op shops in Bentleigh.  Then cups of tea and Music Max at her place.  Still have to go to Italian class - then free for a week!  Yay!  (Except I should work, boo!)  Invention for the day: Fire alarms that only go off if there's actually fire.  The Campus Centre was evacuated again today.

      Number of sleeps until the weekend: 2. Number of days until draft due: 12. Number of sleeps until draft due: 7 or 8.   Semester 1, Week 6, Day 3.   Read Animals Minds article by Davidson.  He considers that to have a belief you require language and you have to have beliefs about beliefs.  It is supposed to be revolutionary and really amazing.  For some reason I found it was the biggest load of bollocks!  (I might have missed some of the subtleties in his argument.)  Went to the travel agent in Oakleigh, where I spent two hours.  Benji and I are going to Cairnes in June - they are having a  urlLink special  at the moment called "get on up".  The guy said that Tassie will be having one soon.  I asked if it would be the "get on down" special?  He thought this was funny.  (We got great air fairs, like $380 return each...)  Went to see Dirk for my supervisor meeting.  He hadn't read my thing.  Sigh.  He had read the thing I sent him last Thursday - chatted briefly about that and my oral presentation (he said we needed to discuss my objective, I said my objectives were to have people go "Lucretius Lucretis Ra Ra Ra!"  (with pom pom moves) he said we needed to discuss my objective...)  Back to Benji's place.  Did some Italian homework for class tomorrow.  It's pretty stressful because she talks to you in Italian and you have to respond.  But, it is pretty laid back so it's not too bad.  Benji and I made pumpkin lasagna.  Yumm.  Edges were a little crusty, but it's all good.  Invention for the day: Supervisor rack.  (Or that think out of  Clockwork Orange  that holds open eyes, plays Beethoven and forces the supervisor to read your thesis as it is displayed on a screen.)  Could also be used for getting better marks.

       Good News and Bad News   Good news: Physio likes the look of my arm, don't need to see her again unless I have trouble.  Bad news: I should wait six months from the time of breakage before putting my weight on my wrist (like doing push ups).  Good news: I back up my thesis regularly (daily if it's been worked on).  Bad news: Word 97 has stopped working on my laptop.  When I try open Word a message says that it's committed an illeagle operation and will be shut down.  Sigh.  Good news: Wrote an Abstract...

      Here it is - for all the world:   Draft Abstract.   Lucretius’ traditional bibliography from Saint Jerome states:  The poet Titus Lucretius Carus was born.  A love potion drove him mad, and he composed, in the intervals of his insanity, several books which Cicero corrected.  He committed suicide aged 43.  With such a reputation, Lucretius views of love were condemned out of hand until the twentieth century.  In Nussbaum’s progressive examination of Lucretius, she shows how the lover is moved beyond obsession with the beloved and disgust at his neediness.  However even Nussbaum considers that Lucretius has removed the riches of love, leaving nothing behind but “will-governed friendship.”  It is my contention that Lucretius outlines two accounts of love. First the dignity account, which asserts that everyone has value and emphasises the beloved’s desire to be loved unconditionally.  Secondly the merit account, which asserts that a person’s value is based on their properties and emphasises the beloved’s desire to be loved for the right reasons.  I show that Lucretius does not remove the riches from love, rather he argues against the dignity account of love and for the merit account.  I conjecture that Nussbaum objects to Lucretius’ argument because she does not agree with the merit account.    Less than 200 words and everything!

      Number of days until thesis draft is due: 13. Number of words: 9,631 Number of words in chuck out document: 3000+ Number of holes a truck could drive through: 0 (maybe a few) Number of holes pasta could be sivved through: lots - though some of those are just paranoia. Number of nights in a row I have had thesis dreams: 2.  How good do I feel about thesis: Pretty good, actually.   Semester 1, Week 6, Day 2.   There is only thesis... though at some point I'll do the reading for my other subjects!  Spent this morning writing arguments for Lucretius' account of love being the dignity and merit accounts of love.  I think I am reading to send it to people about now.  I am about to send it to Dirk.  Other things that need work:  Bibliography (yeah, I  meant  to do it as I went along...) Abstract (100-200 words that seems to be a conglomerate of your introduction and conclusion, but with an advertising twist that makes it sound more interesting than it actually is so that people will turn up and hear me present it.)  Thing that needs starting:  Oral presentation ("We do not talk about it." (look a Star Trek quote!!))  Will spend this afternoon at the physio for a bit.  Then work on other subjects/abstract/oral presentation.  Then singing.  Maybe (just maybe) more than one alto (me) will turn up this week.  Novel.  Invention for the day: Bread that keeps fresh indefinately (or at least for a week, then it can go green).  None of this inbetween going stale business.  This can be expanded to include other bread products and fruit.  (Milk has the right idea, either it's chunky or it flows.)

      Benji and I just survived aerobics.  I did much better this time than two weeks ago.  I actually feel pretty good.  I feel like I want to do more physical stuff, but I don't feel I have any time.  Maybe this will pass once I finish honours.    Still have not ridden my bike this year!

      Number of weeks until ... you know...: 2 Number of words (including footnotes and references, because they are included): 8,898   Semester 1, Week 6, Day 1.   Thesis.  All day.  Some breaks.  Spent the morning going over the Merit Account.  Added lots of quotes from Delaney and Keller and refined point of view.  Started having a minor panic early on, but got over it.  Restructured and edited.  Think it is pretty fit.  Spent the afternoon going over the Dignity Account.  Restructured and edited.  Still think it needs a bit of work.  I think the important thing is that I've shown how there have ALWAYS been two accounts of love - I think (though I have not said so, yet) that there are two accounts because they are trying to solve the conflict between:   Loving someone unconditionally AND Loving someone who merits it   Still need to go over Lucretius and Nussbaum again - but I think I know what I am doing there now.  (Have made summary notes of how sex transforms into love which transforms into psychopathic DOOM!!)  Plan to do this tomorrow and give to Dirk (somehow, seeing email is down for maintenance.  Grrrr.)  Invention for the day: Backup email address that maintenance notice emails are sent to in advance so you can plan around these things.  Grrrr.

       Sunday.... later.   Head feeling much better.  It's amazing what Deep Heat (a loving massage) and Neurofen can do.  Played a couple of games of queenless chess (we play without starting with queens and if a pawn gets to the end, you get to chose what piece you want (that's not a queen)).  Ended up losing one game and in the next, drew (both only had kings left).  Playing with queens means that Benji womps my butt big time (he is a more experienced and superior player.)  Going through my thesis in an effort to summarise my point, as I feel I change my point a couple of times half way through whatever it is that I'm doing.  If I understand what my main points are then I might just manage to keep on track.  (I would put them up here, but as some of you lovely people are going to look at my thesis, I don't want to bias you.... yet.)  I had to hand write it so that it felt all informal and non-committal.  All I have to do is not lose it.  (I couldn't even write in my note pad...)  Plans for tonight...  It's already dark.  I want day light savings back!  (Or at least a minimum of 12 hours day light every day, preferably when I'm up.)  Oh well, seven months of miserable and eight months of rain and then it will be good again.  (I never really did get the hang of Melbourne, I've only been here nine years.)  Go to the supermarket and get food for Benji and I to eat.  Cook (assemble) and eat dinner.  Stuff (may involve thesis). Sleep.  Next week is week 6, then Easter, then thesis, then oral presentation, then thesis (final draft).  Somewhere in that I get to write 9000 words for the subjects I'm doing.    At the end of all this, I am going on holiday!

      Number of days until thesis draft is due: 15. Amount of work left: lots. Number of holes in argument: Unknown.   Saturday.   Went and picked up Benji's new car.  Yay!  There were a lot of $50 notes flying around.  Drove up to Sassafras and had Devonshire tea and went to that neat Tea shop in the new car.  Drove back and picked up my car from the dealer (it was just parked there.)  Went to Jeanie's place for dinner - had very nice spuds with sstuff and pears with dumplings.  Went to Polly's graduation party.  Congrats to Polly.   Sunday.   So far, went to church and got a little palm cross for Palm Sunday.  In terrible pain, neck cramping and have headache (from neck).  Woke up in a bit of a panic about my thesis.  I am not seeing Dirk until Wednesday, he is not going to get a draft until quite late, which means he won't be able to read it, but I need time to work on it.  (And to do the reading for classes on Thursday.)  Feel very stressed.  Invention for the day: Small automatic sign that can sit above people's heads that informs people what not to ask.  E.g. "How's your thesis going?" and "What are you going to do after honours?"  (The answers are, "Oh, just fine" and "Graduate.")

       Draft Chuck out File   I have several windows open at the moment, including my thesis draft and a file that I am chucking stuff I am discarding into.  In my chuck out file I have the various subheadings so I can keep (rough) track of where things have come from should I ever decide to use it or go over it again.  My chuck out file is more than 4000 words...  It is also formatted the same way as my thesis.  I was flicking between windows when suddenly I was subjected to the text (in 16 point Times New Roman small caps) "NUSSBAUMY GOODNESS".  'Argh! I can't hand that in as a draft!' I thought to myself.  Luckily it was in my chuck out file.  I should really work on being kinder to my poor brain.  It's got enough to contend without me being mindlessly cruel to it.   Gibber.   Did you know if you type in Lucretius and Nussbaum into google, this blog comes up as number 11.  Wow!  Soon I shall be thrown out of the philosophical community.  (Incase you are reading this Martha, you can read my draft if you want.  I'm sure I'd be contactable through Monash's philosophy dept.  I swear I am being very respectful and treating your arguments with the utmost dignity.  )  Dignity!  Get it? :)  (She is not reading this, I have heard that she is really harsh on mere graduate students... What IS a graduate student anyway?  I mean, I get undergrad and I get postgrad, but what is a graduate student?  Does that mean that you can only do your study while wearing a silly hat or what?)  On the other hand if you type Ainsley and Monash into google, this blog comes up as number 2.  And if you just type Ainsley, I am number 6.  (Vote for Number 6.)  I hope one day to be number 5, so link to me!  Sorry, I am trying to think of an argument against Nussbaum - she insists that mystery, wonder and erotic excitement are essential features of love.  I want to say that she only thinks that because she is a big Dignity Account proponent.  But what can the Merit Account do?    (What is erotic excitement anyway?  Is that when you're waiting to see if the EFTPOS will go through at the video store while you're hiring porn?  Surely that's what cash is for...)  Now I really am gibbering.  What I need to do to finish my draft:  1. Construct an argument against Nussbaum as above 2. Write a conclusion (my current one a) is out of date and b) sucks) 3. Tidy and chase some references that are untidy 4. Review and update abstract 5. Proof read and correct 6. Print and hand in thesis (plus email abstract to Toby) - but not til Monday.  Okay, I'll work now...

       There's no Dignity   Great, now I have three dignity accounts to contend with (possibly four if you count Saint Paul.)  Actually, they are all the same thing (that's the point of my thesis) with basis in different areas.

      Sometimes I wonder if practicality is really a virtue, then I decide that I do need to eat and prefer clean dishes.  Number of cups of coffee since I resolved to stop drinking it: 0.  Number of sleeps until Monday: 4.  (Figure I'll go hand it in and then go to the Monday Lunchies thing.  Or I'll go to the Monday Lunchies thing and then hand it in.  As long as I hand it in... )  Number of pages including Abstract and Bibliography: 40.   Easter Thursday.   Is there such a thing as Easter Thursday?  Which one is Easter Saturday?  Is it before Easter Sunday?  These are not the sort of questions us philosopher types spend a great deal of time on.  So far, (it being all of 10:45) thesis.  It goes well.  Invention for the day: Instant tea.  (I'm not really sure if this would be a good thing.)

       Easter Tuesday continued...   Went over Dirk's comments.  Won at chess against Benji... eventually.  Managed to get my pawns to the other side for the first time against him.  Singing - some people actually even turned up.  Congrats to them!  Sang  Who Wants to Live Forever , a lot.   Easter Wednesday.   Did some nasty administrative things that have been hanging over my head.  These included paying an overdue phone bill and putting a deposit down on our accomodation.  Went and saw Dirk.  Came up with a few ideas about thesis.  He said we would talk about Oral Presentation and postgraduate stuff after I handed in my draft.  (Apparently Monash Uni take into account your honours marks (like you need an H1 (80%)) but also place heavy emphasis on your undergrad marks.  I wish someone had told me that six years ago.  Mine aren't bad (obviously, because I got into honours), but only one HD in 3rd year philosophy isn't promising...  Dirk said that Melbourne place more emphasis on your honours marks and that it would certainly be worth while applying there.  They have good facilities too.)  Spent this afternoon going over my thesis and re-formatting my footnotes to fit with the style of Bibliography I was copying from my lit review.  Suddenly my word count went nuts!  There is a big difference between "Keller (2000) 175." and "Simon Keller, 'How do I love thee : Let me count the properties', American Philosophical Quarterly, p 175."  Ended up shortening them by refering to the full title the first time, then indicating that I was going to abbreviate.  This helped.  Plans for this afternoon:  Italian homework (i.e. break from thesis.)  Plans for rest of the week:  THESIS!!!!  Invention for the day: The kind of rubber used in dodgem cars to be placed on the edges of computer desks.  (My knees have several bruises.)

      I have begun to wonder what will happen to my blog once I finish honours, as it has been primarily focused around honours, as my life has been primarily focused around honours.  Obviously this leads to thoughts about what I want to do after honours.  I don't think "attempt to have my blog published and live of the royalties" is a viable option.  Especially seeing as I could hardly offer exclusive rights or anything.  (I have a cup of tea now, things should start looking up...)  Both Benji's parents managed to ask the question equivalent of "So... whatcha gonna do after honours?"  Sigh.  This has also led me to think about what I want to do after honours.  All of this thinking has led me to one conclusion: Both time and money are finite.  Sigh.  (It has also led me ot think that I would get more out of life by living it, rather than sighing over it.)  I think there are conflicting wants in life, just the way things are.  I would like to:   a) study forever b) own a house c) have a meaningful career d) travel a lot  Some of these things are compatible a bit, but not all of them all of the time...  So, what am I going to do after honours?  1. Go to Cairnes with Benji. 2. Graduate (well apply to graduate in absentia... not paying for the stupid robes again.) 3. Pray.  In that order.  That seems like a good start.  After all, I had to go to Perth to figure out I  really  wanted to do honours.  It's amazing how Victoria rots your brain!

      6 days to go.  I'll jump right in!   Saturday.   Went to the prom from the farm and did the Lilly Pilly Gully walk, which is about two hours.  Played games and did stuff on the farm.   Easter Sunday.   Went on the four wheeler bike to look for a calf.  Got very dusty and disgusting hair.  Played lots more games.  Benji and I tried to get Word 97 to work on my laptop.  Sigh.  Some Easter egg hunting.   Easter Monday.   Went to Yarram.  Benji got a flat tire, so we changed it.  Back to the farm for lunch, then back home.  Aerobics!  Benji and I are a bit sore.   Easter Tuesday.   Slept in!  Went to Chadstone the Fashion Capital for a bit.  Didn't buy anything.  Don't have any money.  (Well, don't have any money that I want to spend.  Obviously have some money.)  I am going to look over Dirk's comments - seeing him tomorrow.  (Less than a week to go!  Nail biting time!)  Decided that coffee makes me feel ill and jittery.  Asked Benji to help me quit.... he seems to think this includes tea too.  So not!  Invention for the day: Coffee that doesn't make me ill and jittery - but still improves brain functions.

       Semester 1, Week 7, Day 4.   Classes today.  Gained popularity (not) in Animal Minds by accusing a philosopher of either offering definitions or begging the question.  (Got told it was a difficult paper and even teacher was having difficulty with it.  Not convinced....)  We have been given some easier papers now.  I have no idea what I am going to write my essay on.  Saw Dirk (managed to catch him) and asked if I could see him about my oral presentation.  He said he could see me on Monday 3rd.  I said that this was a bit unacceptible seeing I was giving it on May 10 and practicing on May 5.  So I am seeing him next Tuesday (27th).  Phew.  Saw my little thesis poking out from beneath some other stuff.  Dirk said he hadn't even flicked over the front cover yet.  I could not help but say, "That's not surprising."  Gained popularity in Value Theory by offering ideas that teacher thought were interesting.  Velleman (him again) has this idea that what makes sense for us to do next should cohere with our lifes' stories.  But this doesn't give us any reason to act for other people.  So I suggested that we should act in order to help other's life stories cohere, or to add to humanity's life story.  That was the second last class, I have no idea what I am going to write my essay on.  But, best of allness....  Wrote to  urlLink Simon Keller  (who wrote "How do I love thee?  Let me count the properties?" - i.e. a big big merit account, properties kinda guy) yesterday, on Dirk's suggestion.  Dirk said that the article came out of his honours thesis.  He obviously did alright to get into Boston and stuff.  Anyway... asked Simon if he'd be interested in reading my little thesis draft.  He has written back (already) and said that he would.  He said:  Thanks for getting in touch, and yes, I'd be very happy to have a look at your thesis. Send it through. One warning - I've been writing a little more on some of this stuff, and so I might hit you with some draft material too.  How neat is that?  So I might forgive the fact that he goes for  urlLink Geelong .  Invention for the day: Supervisor Speed.  Small injection that allows supervisors to read your thesis and mark it, even though they are up to their eyeballs in hiring a new Bioethics guy.

      Still no coffee.   Semester 1, Week 7, Day 1.   Handed in thesis draft.  Bounced all the way down the escalator.  Went to philosophy honours lunchy and chatted to folks.  Went shopping.  Had snooze.  Went to Aerobics.  Shower and sleep.   Semester 1, Week 7, Day 2.   Read Davidson's  Rational Animals  again.  He keeps using words like "is required by" and "is just to have" and "must have" so as far as I can figure, he offers a glossary rather than an argument for why animals don't have thoughts and beliefs.  Watched some bad, bad tv.  Including Timmy from  Passions  teaching bikers how to dance.   Semester 1, Week 7, Day 3.   A lot of nothing.  A fair bit of talking to Hannah.  Was thwarted in my attempt to ride my bike by nasty stupid horrid french valves.  Now have flatter bike tires.  Turns out Ethan killed Julian.  Ivy and Rachel are going to use the security video to get Theresa to confess to it.  Not sure what the rest of today holds....  Invention for the day:  Personal Organiser that actually organises you by organising things to go into your diary and not just relying on you to organise them and then enter them.

      One more sleep...   Sunday.   Nope, this time it really is finished.  It's proof read, it's formatted, it has the word count nicely printed.  All I need to do now is print it off hand it in.  That's it.  (Well, fill out a cover sheet...)  Also did Italian homework.  Had to describe myself and two celebrities.  Invention for the day: Free printing at universities.

      Failed to go to the postgrad seminar as it was cancelled.  Days until Dirk will give me back the first draft: 4.   Not that I'm counting.  (I want my thesis back so I have an indication of how much work I have to do.)   Semester 1, Week 8, Day 4.    Classes today.  Animal Minds was good.  We discussed a paper by Susan Hurley.  Once again we have looked at a paper with great ideas and almost no argument (see also Davidson.)  Sigh.  Two of the guys are big Davidson fans.  Davidson is like, we cannot attribute beliefs that explain behaviour to animals because we cannot know which belief they have (many would explain their behaviour.)  Davidson requires a web of interconnected beliefs.  Hurley is like, we can ascribe beliefs that are sufficient to explain behaviour.  We just need to accept that they cannot reason in all areas, we can have islands of belief.  I am with Hurley.  I just wished her argument was better.  Next week we are doing criticisms of Hurley and her responses.  That should be good.  Value Theory was also good.  (Last class.)  We have been doing the various papers of Korsgaard and Jeanette found one that criticises her, so I shall read that.  I feel MUCH better about this subject now that I feel I can write an essay on it (seeing the essay is like worth 100%!)  Still have to do Italian Homework.  I didn't go last week, so I am going to try to learn from Benji's notes.  Yeak!  So things are looking up for me.  (In that I was worried what I was going to write about.)  I guess.    Although I did have a conversation with a professor at uni yesterday (when I turned up to the cancelled postgrad seminar) which made me think that perhaps my thesis was bollucks.  Sigh.  Sometimes it is very hard to put things in your own words.  If you are trying to summarise someone elses summary of a position, you don't end up saying a lot very clearly.  Thoughts just get concentrated to a point where they can't really be expressed anymore.   Plans for Tomorrow   1. Apply for Heath Care Card (I have no income and my bank statements have just come in.) 2. Go to Doctors (that's private)  3. Go to parents place for dinner (Dad's birthday on Monday, he will be 2xMyAge + 5.)  I also hope to do work on Oral Pres.  Invention for the day: Stockings with padded soles for wearing with boots.  I have sore feet.  Alternatively, shoes that grow or shrink depending on whether or not the wearer is wearing socks or stockings.  Other invention (suggestion): Get more doctors at Monash.  I don't think it's that unreasonable to be able to make an appointment at 1:00 and have at least some spots available that day.

      Well, looking over the last post, at least I managed to achieve:  1. Cup of tea.  After that I had a snooze and then singing.  Days until my FINAL thesis is due: 33.  Days until Dirk will give me back the first draft: 5. Days until it's ALL OVER: 47. Number of things I have to do: 4 (Thesis, Oral Presentation and two essays for coursework.)   Semester 1, Week 8, Day 3.   Spent this morning reading the reading for Animal Minds, a paper by a lady called Susan Hurley.  I just love articles that go along the lines of "*blah* as I showed in *authorname* in my chapter N of my *bookname* (1996)"  Had a minor hissy fit and decided I couldn't do anything, was good at nothing and what the hell was I doing this all for anyway.  This seems to be becoming a regular (nay, daily) occurance.  Got on with it and started on my oral presentation, including reading what I'd written... OUT LOUD!!  It took about 9 minutes to read 1250 words, so I figure I need about 2400 words.  At one point I had 2800 words, but I cut back.  It is looking in a pretty fit state.  I don't like my exposition of Velleman, but I can change that.  Once I have some comments back from Dirk and am happy with it, I shall prepare the handout and the overhead projector stuff.  (I was considering using power point, but then I decided that would be a) showing off and b) tempting the fates of the stress chip inside the departments hardware.)  I am giving a practice Oral Presentation next Wednesday (in 7 days) at the postgrad seminar so I figured I'd rock up to one before I do so this week.  So I am going to the postgrad seminar.  Sigh.  Invention for the day: Change machines on buses.  I had correct change, but I think it would be a neat idea.

      Meeting with Dirk went well, was short.  He has promised to god (not bad for an aetheist) that he will read my thesis on Thursday, or failing that Sunday, but definately by Monday at 2:00 when I am meeting him again.  Now have to prepare oral presentation.  Sigh.  I have decided to concentrate a bit on Value Theory because I have read all the articles and I think I should be able to come up with something to write about on a lady called  urlLink Christine Korsgaard .  She is pretty neat.  Her basic idea is that the basis for normativity (why we are obligated to do stuff) is that there are no private reasons for actions, but only public reasons which we construct.  So, this eliminates the egoists idea that it is impossible for my private reasons to become reasons for me to help you.  There are only public reasons that give us reason to help each other.  (Insert small gripe about stupid buttons on the mouse on the left side that tell Internet Explorer to go Back, when all you were doing was casually reaching for the mouse here.)  So now what?  Still uninspired.  Suppose I'd best work on my oral presentation.  Dirk said to do a good handout.  Maybe I'll start with that.  Mouse (girl in korner) said I looked tired.  Didn't sleep well last night.  Failed in my quit coffee campaign, had coffee last night.  What was I thinking?  (I think it was something along the lines of, "Stuff this.  I'm tired, they're going to be drinking it in front of me and it's going to smell mighty good.")  Was this self-betrayal or a genuine change of heart?  (We were looking at the difference in Value Theory last week.)  I'm inclined to go with self-betrayal.  Ah well.   I think I will act as follows:  1. Cup of tea. 2. Prepare (start to prepare) Oral Presentation.  (According to Velleman, believing that I will act in a certain way gives me good reason to act in a certain way...)

      Yay!  I have been reinstated as a lovely lovely borrowing library member!  (With only $4.00 in fines.)  I kind of resent being fined for books that no-one has borrowed in the last 5 years or so.  Like  De Rervm natvra, libri sex / edited with prolegomena, critical apparatus, translation, and commentary  by Cyril Bailey.  I mean, who borrows this kind of stuff?  (Besides little mad, mad me?) That cost me $2.50!  Let that be a lesson to check my email every couple of days and never borrow more books than I can carry.

      Days until my FINAL thesis is due: 34. Number of sleeps until then: 26.   Sunday continued....   Spent the rest of the day playing computer games.  Eventually it was dinner time, then bed time.  I won at Civ III (achieved a domination victory - your borders encompass more than 66% of the land mass).   Semester 1, Week 8, Day 1.   Slept in.  It was wonderful.  Benji had the day of work for ANZAC day.  So we dropped the car off at the mechanic (minor problem which should be covered by warrenty) and went to Eastland.  It's a bit scary there.  Poked my tongue out at a kid or two.  Had some lunch and then went back to Benji's.  Cup of tea and chess.  Wasn't feeling very good - neck headache.  Played  Settlers of Catan  with Jeff, Damien and Benji.  Damien won both games.  Home and bed.  Sleep is bliss.   Semester 1, Week 8, Day 2.   Starting to panic.  Completely uninspired for both course work subjects and should really write at least one of the essays or make a decent start on both of them soon, before thesis final is due in (that's worth 30% and the essays are 12.5% each.)  Also only 8 days until I have to give my practice oral presentation at the post grad seminar.  Sigh.  I can't wing it cold so I will have to do SOME work on it.  Seeing Dirk this afternoon to discuss oral presentation.  It would be nice if he had some time to actually give it some thought and discuss it with me.  (I should be alright anyway, but it's nice to get confirmation that you're on the right track.)  So this morning I have returned my nasty overdue library books, now I'm using the database journal thing to find some articles for coursework... and blogging.  Invention for the day: Cerebral implant teleprompter.

       Semester 1, Week 7, Day 5.   Spent most of the day sitting on the couch.  At some point I read my value theory readings.  Friday night was a quiet one at home.  It's been really cold recently.   Saturday.   Woke up too early.  Hired some DVDs.  Avril and Matt came over to Benji and Damien's place.  I was there too.  Went to Bowie and Katie's engagement party.  It was a lot of fun, though a touch cold.  I'm glad I wore jeans.  It was really nice to catch up with a few people I hadn't seen in ages like Alex and Dave's family.   Sunday.   Nothing much so far, bit of chess.  Invention for the day: I dunno.  Microwaves that heat foot without overheating it.

       Saturday.   Slept in, bliss.  All ready to go to Jennie and Liam's wedding. Bit scary really.  Liam I met in year 11, when he was in year 10.  That was more than ten years ago...  Jennie I met in second year, when she was in first year.  That was about eight years ago...  I lived with them for a while in fourth year.  I moved around a lot as a kid, so this whole knowing someone for more than five years (or two years) is a bit of a shock.  Invention for the day: Instant friend, just add water (also available, instant bonk bunny.)

       Thing I have done.   Reduced the number of times I use the word "consider" from 93 to 20.  Phew.  Such replacements include:  Assert, claim, say, state, think.  (I have also taken Simon Keller's comments into account.)   Things to do:   1.  Be more charitable to Nussbaum by outlining the "mystery" in the dignity account nicely.  (Vomit.) 2.  Give a cultural Roman and contemporary discription of the mythos of love (Fate, we were meant to be together, star crossed lovers...)  (Vomit.) 3.  Argue for the discrepancies between the cause and justification of love in the dignity account.  (Interesting.)

       Semester 1, Week 9, Day 5.    "How can it be the last day of Week 9 when I haven't done any more work yet?"  I was thinking.  It then occured to me that most of this week has been spent in preparing my lovely Oral Presentation.  Joy and rapture.  Today I have been working on my thesis.  Actually working on it, not like yesterday when I said I would, and instead threw a wobbly and had a small nervous break down instead.  Didn't go to Italian last night - small nervous break down instead.  (Went to Chadstone the Fashion Capital and wandered around.)  I worked out I need to get exactly 80% for all of my remaining bits of work (2 essays, thesis, oral presentation) to get an H1.  (Which is 80% or higher.)  So I guess my marks have made up for that crappy Aesthetics essay.  One of Dirk's comments was that I could exercise a bit more charity towards Nussbaum.   Sigh.  I also have to find some kind of Greek love myth thing.  Sigh.  MORE research.  Going to the library this afternoon, once parking is free (at four.)  Also should print out handouts for Monday so I don't have to on Monday.  Invention for the day:  Warm air vents on keyboards.  Or keyboards that warm your hands in some other way, even when not typing.  My finger nails are not quite purple.  It would also be neat if they trimmed your nails too.  (I am almost getting to the talon stage.)

       Semester 1, Week 9, Day 4.    Animal Minds class this morning.  It went well.  One more class next week and that's it.  Had another deep disagreement with this guy who thinks that Davidson is just right.  This is mostly because I think Davidson is just wrong.  I saw the proposed example essay questions, I have decided to attempt to formulate my own.  Value Theory is finished, so no class.  Propose to spend the afternoon working on my thesis - the sooner this is completed, the sooner I can write these essays.  (Dread.)  Must review my use of the word "consider".  Style, puh!  I have no style - as anyone who has seen me dressed knows.  (Which is everyone who knows me.)  Also must do Italian homework before class tonight.  (Three more to go... including tonight.)  Invention for the day: Nose flusher.  Small invisible button that, when pressed, clears stuffy or dribbly nose of all mucus.  Failing that, super soft tissues.  The Kleenex aloe vera ones are pretty neat, but I go through them so quickly.  Mmmm, luxury bed of mucus.

      Why oh why is it so cold and how am I going to survive??  (Proof that I am not an empirically minded philosopher.)   Semester 1, Week 9, Day 3.   Spent this morning doing a few domestics things at home (as opposed to domestic stuff at Benji's I suppose.)  Then was reading my book ( The Grand Sophie , again) and went over my speech twice.  Went to uni and delivered oral presentation, it went quite well.  There were no other honours students there, but a number (six?) of PhD students and Dirk, John and Monima turned up.  It went well.  I sat and answered questions for about 50 minutes.  They seemed to think it was interesting.  Invention for the day: Small light on overhead projectors that indicates when the text is in focus, or alternatively, autofocussing overhead projectors.

       Oral Presentation   Have got overhead transperencies, handouts and speech ready for tomorrow.  I am giving a practice one at the postgrad seminar tomorrow and the real thing next Wednesday.  If you think I wouldn't mind you turning up, come along tomorrow... 5:00 room W916.  It should go for about 20 minutes, plus 10 minutes question time (at the moment it is going for about 17 minutes...)  I practiced in the laundry.  I hope to practice again tonight and twice tomorrow.  Takes a while though (about 17 minutes.)   In other news...   I forgot to mention, Simon Keller got back to me!!!  He said that as an honours thesis it would serve me well (which may translate as "fat chance of getting that published!")  He has a couple of neat suggestions and said he wasn't convinced about a few things.  (I am half tempted to scrap the stuff he wasn't convinced about, because I'm not convinced anymore...)  He also said I used the word "considers" too many times.  I should do a break down of words I use.  It would look something like this:  That: Too many!!! Love: lots Account: lots Considers: lots Value: lots Dignity: lots Merit: lots Lucretius: lots Velleman: lots Keller: less lots Delaney: less lots Properties: less lots Incomparable: less lots etc. Insane: 3.  Someone's bound to have a program that does this.  (I used to be able to write one!)  (Hey, not everyone gets to use "insane" in their philosophy thesis.

       Semester 1, Week 9, Day 2.   Finished preparation for Oral Presentation.  Requires some practice reading.  Printed out my slides for photocopying onto overheads (eventually.)  Worked out how to duplexi print my handouts.  Accidently duplexed my speech, reprinted speech.  About to go up to dept and see if I can get overheads photocopied.  Otherwise will go to library and give it a go there.  Invention for the day: Powerpoint that lets you preview what formatting it thinks its doing.

      Still feeling a bit virusy, so no aerobics.   Draft Thesis   Got my draft thesis back from Dirk.  Got a mark I am pretty happy with (HD).  He has a couple of suggestions (such as word length, repetition and adding some stuff to make it clearer.)  He doesn't mark the final draft, and he marked this as a draft, so it's not completely indicative of the mark I'll get for the final version.  (But things are promising...)  Thanks to Benji and David for reading it and their suggestions.  YAY!!!  Also Dirk said my Oral Presentation Handout looks just the thing.  Booked the departments over head projector for Wednesday and next Monday.  I decided this was an impressive, but low tech (low risk) solution.  Came home and read OP out loud, took about 16 minutes (it has to be 15-20) so I figure I need to read slower.  Just a bit slower.  I have a section which I can drop if I am threatening to go over, so it should be fine.  My OP is about 2400 words.

       Semester 1, Week 8, Day 5.   Worked a little on Oral Presentation. Applied for Health Care Card at Oakleigh.  Miserable Centrelink place.  Went to the Doctors.  I had been feeling dizzy and nauseus for about 9 days.  Apparently I have a virus that is affecting my inner ears (hence the dizziness.)  I have felt pretty whacked for about a week now, really tired and not much "can be botheredness."  Took the bus up to Box Hill and met Mum there, who took me to their place.  Had dinner withBenji,  Mum, Dad and Selina for Dad's birthday (today, Monday.)  It was pretty nice.  Lift back with Benji (who came from work.)   Saturday.   Slept in.  Yay.  Dawdled over breakfast, got ready and went to Sarah and Phil's wedding.  It was very cold, but lovely.  Our table was near the heater.  Poor Benji (who wore shoes) was very warm.  I almost thawed.   Sunday.   Went to church, they had a sausage sizzle.  Spent most of the afternoon curled up around a hot water bottle.  My neck was giving me trouble again.  Managed to read an article and have a snooze.  Then spent a bit helping (hindering) Benji, who was trying to fix the net connection at his place.  Still feel dizzy and crap.   Semester 1, Week 9, Day 1.   WEEK 9!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This means:  Exactly 1 week until oral presentation. Exactly 4 weeks until final thesis is due. Exactly 6 weeks until I finish everything!!  ARHHH!!!  (I might have to face the real world after that, but instead I am going to Cairnes.)  This morning I worked on my oral presentation.  I now have (in draft form): A textual speechy thing A handout A power point presentation (save us!!)  This afternoon I am going to see Dirk and hopefully get my thesis back (he promised....)  I'll let you know (nail biting time.)  At least my neck is okay today.  Invention for the day: Autocontrol central heating vents so you don't have to heat rooms you aren't in, but don't have to walk around manually closing vents.  They probably already have this, in which case.... Retrofitted automatic central heating vents so you don't...

       Gotta do the gardening.   Gotta do the gardening Gotta do the gardening Feel my hard trees hardening Have to beg your pardoning Got to get in the garden Got to do it now  (To the tune of "I've been everywhere man".  Badly remembered Greg Champion and the Coodabeens lyrics.... I think.)  Didn't end up working any more on Animal Minds.  Instead went home.  Noted that it was colder inside that out in the sun.  Spoke to Beryl (the lady at No. 6)about what she was going to plan in the front garden bed.  Went out the back yard and decided to do something about it.  So I went to Bunnings and bought:  4 Azalias to match the ones that died. 2 Random cheap plants. 1 Large but Ainsley managable shovel. 1 Leaf rake.  Spent the afternoon mowing (it's a unit and there's not much space for grass, but we only have a push mower and some very determined grass...) and then raking the leaves and grass for the bin.  Then I pulled (dug, coaxed and swore) out the old roots and stumps of the dead plants and planted the Azalias with some potting mix I bought ages ago.  I also planted the random things.  Hopefully they take.  Waters the little dears in.  I turned out some soil that's useless and full of pebbles and weeds.  Put everything away and was stuffed.  Phew!  It was nice to do some physical labour.  I felt really awake and it felt good to be in the sun sweating and working and stuff.  My hands are a little sore and rough from the pulling of the stumps (and I have a bit of skin missing) but it's all good.  It made my shower afterwards rather rewarding too.  Tonight I think Benji and I are going out to dinner.  (Well, I'm all dressed up for it anyway.)  It will be our semi-anniversary on Tuesday (6 months technically.)  Wow.  I sometimes just marvel at how things have turned out.  We get along so well and I'm always happy to be in his company.  And he feels the same.  Sigh.    I am REALLY looking forward to going to Cairnes.  We are hiring a  urlLink Britz Campervan  for some of the time so we can see the  urlLink Daintree  and stuff.  Hopefully it's better than when Jeans and I went to Walpole last June and saw the  urlLink Valley of the Giants .  It was very pretty, but Jeanie was  terrified of heights (you go along a 40m high suspensiony bridge thing) and I was motion sick (it wobbles).  Only a month to go...

       Animal Minds Essay.   I have a plan!!  You know things are good when your plan is just under 500 words.  Remember when I was talking about  urlLink beliefs ?  (Look, a link to myself!!!)  Well, anyway, I think Susan Hurley is offering a middle ground account between 2 and 3.  Most philosophers think that she fails.  Now, is this because it is not possible to offer such an account or is it the interpretive tools that she uses from her 3ist attitude can't do the work for her?  (Or is she really just offering an 2 account anyway?)  Yay brains and coffee.  (Still freezing hands.)

       Coffee Update.   It was warm and it was syruppy and it was yum.  And, it warmed up my little hands a bit too.  Wheeeeeeeee!!!!  (The sound of Ainsley spinning around the room like a mad woman.)  (I can't believe I wrote "man woman" before.  Too much Jerry Springer is seeping through my brain!)  Coooooooooooooffffffffffffffffffeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!

         	 Number of Coffees: 2*. Number of Theses received back from Supervisor: 1. (Yay) Number of Theses changed sent back to Supervisor: 1. (Yay) Number of Days until Thesis is due: 17. Number of Days until it's all over and I go to Cairnes for 12 days: 31.  *One consumed, one sitting in in front of me about to be consumed.   Semester 1, Week 10, Day 5.   Day 5?  Do you know what this means?  It's the end of the week.  Slept in, slept well, slept warm.  No longer feel like life is being drained from me.  Don't know what was wrong, perhaps I just needed more coffee.  Still freezing.  I was okay, but now I've been typing so long my hands are turning into frozen claw like purple things.  Will wrap them around my coffee mug shortly.  I got a response with a copy of my thesis from Dirk this morning.  He used the subject line "looking good" so he thinks my thesis is looking good.  I am down to 10,039 words including footnotes.  I realised that if I went through and changed a heap of footnotes to "op. cit." things would be much easier, but I can't be bothered at this point.  I will be sending out a "please proof read this draft" draft soon.  If you would like to proof it or just read it please, please email me - otherwise I will assume you don't want to read it, which is fair enough, it is like 10,000 words.  Some of the words aren't even mine.  In fact, a fair few of the words are Lucretius' translated by Brown and retyped (one handed) by me.  Intend to work on Animal Minds (had a couple o' thoughts this morning while lying in warm, warm bed) this afternoon.  Otherwise I am going to have to REALLY panic - as opposed to the fake whiny stuff I've been doing lately.  Nah, I know if I just plod along I should (at this point) have oodles of time.  Like a whole month.  Just because it's taken me 10 months to write 10,000 words doesn't mean I can't write 9000 words in one month.    And this evening?  Who knows???   Tea vs Coffee   Tea does not require a teaspoon to make, coffee does. Tea does not make me spin around the room like a mad woman, coffee does.  Hmmm, tough choice.  Invention for the day: Self cleaning teaspoons.

      Number of Coffees (so far): 1. Number of Days until Thesis is due: 18. Number of Days until it's all over and I go to Cairnes for 12 days: 32. Amount of money handed over to Travel Agent: lots.   Semester 1, Week 10, Day 4.   Slept in this morning.  Slept badly last night.  I am always tired and I never feel like working.  Went to the library and returned some books on Catallus (dead Roman poet) and borrowed a book for by Susan Hurley for Animal Minds.  Went to last class and discussed essay briefly with Monima.  I know what I want to write about, but I don't think I have any brilliant ideas or contentions as yet.  I am hoping they will come as I sit and  do the expository work on Hurley.  Couple of the students said I looked really wasted.  I said I'd been a bit miserable.  Some of the students were really ahead (they already had thoughts).  Now I know how the poor students last year felt about my smug little, Hey I've written the essay already, face.  Those poor people.  Went for a walk in the sunshine.  Without coat or jumper!  Went to the Travel Agents in Oakleigh and paid the balance of the money we owe for the trip to Cairnes.  Mmmm, sunshine.  Can't wait.  If only I didn't have 9000 words to write in between now and then.  (I wonder how many coffees that is.)  Invention for the day:  Heated towel rails that facilitate in drying your towel between uses even if it is hung in a bathroom that's steamy and has no exhaust fan or windows.  But I'm not bitter.

      Number of Coffees: 2. Number of Theses sent to Supervisor: 1. (Yay) Number of Days until Thesis is due: 19. Number of Days until it's all over and I go to Cairnes for 12 days: 33.   Semester 1, Week 10, Day 3.   Phew.  After procrastination and TWO coffees I managed to write some more stuff on my thesis and send it to Dirk for review.  I had to plug that Cupid thing I was talking about before.  I couldn't think of anything, it was horrible.  I just felt crappy and tired.  Then I had coffee and I wrote on some other areas of my thesis, then I had another coffee and it all happened for me.  Screw this giving up coffee crap!  I NEED it.  It makes my thesis valid.  I may love coffee more than Lucretius at this rate.    Q. What do you call an old coffee drinker?   A. A 'has bean'.  (Apparently I'm reaching with this... but you haven't seen some of the arguments in my thesis - I would be Mr Tickle for sure (he has very long arms).)  I was going to do more work on my Animal Minds essay, but for some reason my thesis seemed more pressing.  Maybe this has something to do with it being due in less than three weeks and being worth 30% instead of 12.5%... but maybe not.  Probably though.  It was sunny but cold today, I am in my best flanny with my purple coat and scarf on.  My hands weren't too bad today because I spent most of the day refusing to type and stressing.  Still don't know what I am going to do after Honours.  Masters, I guess.  Invention for the day: Accurate 8-Ball that tells the future.

       Semester 1, Week 10, Day 2.   I would like to be able to say that I had a really productive and worthwhile day.  But I didn't.  I spent this morning looking at Hurley's readings for Animals Minds and trying to figure out what she is going on about.  Did that.  She thinks that beliefs are option number 3, but applies them to animals too.  Had some thoughts about my essay which I jotted down.  I spent most of the day being freezing, either at my place or at Benji's.  I ended up at my place for a lot of the day watching crap tv and trying to be warm with our electricity eating wall heater.  It is warm, but only heats the lounge.  I feel good about the fact that I have thought about Animal Minds and think I know what I'm going to write my essay on.  I haven't had a really good idea to say anything for or against Hurley yet, but there's time.  I think I would have coped better if I had had warmer hands.  Being cold just makes me miserable and tired.  Invention for the day: Hot water bottles that you can put boiling water into.  I know that you could put boiling water into them, but then they crack and leave blue plastic on your favourite coat.  Using hot water from the tap just isn't hot enough.  Maybe I could mix them...

       Beliefs.   What are beliefs?  Until I did Animal Minds I hadn't given this much thought.  Now I seem to be about to write a 4500 word essay on it.  Here are three suggestions:  1. Beliefs are brain wirings facts.  (A belief is the way that a bunch of neurons are linked.)  Animals with brains (or brain like things) could have beliefs - this would be apparent by cracking open their head and looking at the connected neurons.  2. Beliefs are brain states about the world.  (A belief is a representation of the world in the head that does not map directly onto the way the brain is wired.)  Animals with brains (or brain like things) could have beliefs - this would be apparent by their behaviour.  Critters that can distinguish ends and means must have knowledge of the world and so have these "belief" brain states.  3. Beliefs are ficticious constructs.  (A belief is a tool used to interpret behaviour.)  Davidson argues it makes no sense to interpret animal behaviour we could not get a fine grained belief (What  exactly  does your dog believe when you come home?  We cannot answer this question through interpreting his behaviour)  In this case only human beings have beliefs because we can ask them what they believe.    My intuition is to go with Number 2.  I don't think doing this subject has changed that intuition.  I don't think that beliefs are fiction, nor do I think that they are merely brain wiring facts.  When I say that I have the belief 'Benji has gone to work' I think that this represents the way I think the world is.  I may act on this belief at a later state (by buying him a surprise present) and the belief would explain my behaviour (along with a bunch of other beliefs and a few desires - such as to make Benji happy by surprising him) but my belief exists independantly of my actions or words about the belief.  It is a complicated brain state and if I was a dualist about the mind, it would exist there.  (This in turn leads me to consider that other critters have minds too, with the possible exception of PE teachers.)

       Thesis Update   Number of Weeks: 3.  I have managed to get my thesis uner the 10,000 word limit, though I still have some things to add.  It's under 9,000 words if you don't include footnotes, but footnotes are included in the 8-10,000 word limit.  Yay.  I have seen that I can drivvel on an awful lot, but readers of this blog should not be surprised by this.

      Arh!   urlLink Blogger  has a scary new interface.   Semester 1, Week 10, Day 1.   Oral Presentation Day.  Slept quite soundly, except when I woke up at about 4:00 in a blind panic.  Took ages to get back to sleep.  My back and neck are a scout hall of knots.  Dithered around at my place and Benji's before going to uni.  Had lunchies with honours folk at Wholefoods.  Did Oral Presentation.  I think it went well.  I think last time was better (I was afraid of that.)  I was shaking so much I couldn't breathe, so I really slowed down.  I was not breating so much I couldn't talk.  I got laughed at a couple of times, but this is to be expected when one uses hand motions as big as mine.  I hammed it up a little, especially when quoting Lucretius.  Dirk and Fiona thought it went well.  Monima (who said she'd give me full marks last time) was my second marker (Toby the first.)  I hope Monima is true to her word!  Still, didn't stutter too much.  Went and had a chat with Fiona afterwards (she is one of Dirk's PhD students, she's into Plato and Aristotle, but tinkers with critter like Epicurus and Lucretius too.)  She had some good questions which I plan to think about.  Then went and saw Dirk and asked him about this Cupid thing.  He suggested that what was needed was a way of telling a story about love and why this seems to be a commone experience.  I am having a think about that too.  Then I went and chatted to Mel in the caf for a bit.  Now I'm back at Benji's.  Quite zonked.  Invention for the day: Back de-knotter that is painless.  Failing that, painless deep heat that can be applied to broken or sensitive skin.

      Jennie and Liam's wedding was lovely.  They put on a really classy do.  Everyone looked great and I think everyone had a great time.  Jean's comment was that Jennie looked really smug.  She did.  But not in a vicious kind of way or anything.  What can you say about a couple who plays  I want Candy  while cutting the cake?   Sunday.   Struggled, but made it to church this morning.  Sat around this afternoon and had a small hissy (again) about my thesis.  I had not thought about it much on Saturday, so things were sweet and I was able to smile to people when they asked how it was going and say it was going well.  BUT I AM STRESSED!!!!  I have my Oral Presentation tomorrow...  I will go over it before then.  (I am worried because I have two essays to write plus a thesis and oral presentation and it takes me two weeks to write an essay and I have five weeks to go.)  I have just done some good work on my thesis, which I shall do for a bit longer, before giving up.  I need a Cupid thing (see 2. below.)  Invention for the day: For the bridesmaids, those bras with the plastic see through straps but that are grippy so they don't slip through the adjusty thing all the time.  (Poor Alice.)

       Semester 1, Week 11, Day 4.   Blurgh.  Feeling less good today.  All my poor little neck muscles went spaz and tensed up so I had a headache and slept terribly.  Spent a lot of today watching second season  Red Dwarf .  Also wrote about 600 words.  I am a bit worried, I was hoping I would write and an idea would come.  I have done the exposition of Hurley, but no big idea of how to support her or knock her down has come.  It would be easy enough to knock her down I guess (just insist that Davidson is right, but reading his articles is like drinking a block of cheese through a straw.)  Went to see if I could get my vouchers for the trip to Cairnes, but they were only posted from Queensland yesterday, I will go back next week.  Isn't Queensland an odd name for a state.  Why not name it after the queen (probably because they already did that with Victoria) rather than generally any old queen.  Don't you hate it when you answer your own questions just by writing them?  And yet, this is what I was hoping would happen with my essay.  Sigh.  Invention for the day: A really neat idea for my Animal Minds essay that is so original and well thought through that I get a 90% for the essay.

       Semester 1, Week 11, Day 3.   I feel really good.  I am getting over this nasty cold, I'm not sick every time I eat and I'm not too stressed.  Today I wrote 1000 words about Susan Hurley.  (I'm up to 2500 words.)  I shall write more tomorrow.  Then I went to Bunnings (Where lowest prices are just the beginning) and bought this stuff that kills Dandylions (suck on that Kenya!) and some more of the second kind of plant I bought the other day and 50 Litres of mulchy stuff.  Raked up the leaves in our back yard (the lemon tree is dropping) and did some more weeding.  Then poured mulch onto some of the flower beds (don't have enough, might get more later).  More weeding and planted the other plants I bought.  Then I looked at the tub that Hannah got from her folks with some lettuces in it, long since deceased.  So I went to the Hardware store in Clayton (which was on a Small Business show on tv once about how to survive against nasty competitors like Bunnings) and bought some Blue Pansy seedlings.  Then went back home and planted the pansies in Hannah's box and put the left over ones in the front garden bed.  (This is part kindless and part guilt.  Last night while doing the dishes I knocked her egg cup onto the floor and it broke, a lot.)    Spoke to Beryl from No. 6.  She is going to buy somemore plants to put in the front bed tomorrow.  Her cat has just come back from having a tooth drawn at the vets and needs to have two tablets everyday for her thyroid.  Poor Beryl can't bend to get the cat and hold it down long enough to get the tablet down.  So with all of that I didn't watch  Passions .  Invention for the day: Tiled floors that allow objects to bounce.

       Semester 1, Week 11, Day 2.   Spent the day working on Animal Minds Essay.  Wrote 1500 words + sundry others that I obliterated.  Also watched  Passions .  Tabitha (the witch) created a tea with Juniper Berries (apparently an halucinagin) and "read" people's tea at Charities 18th Birthday Party.  Magill (Charities boyfriend) liked the smell of the berries, so he took some to the hotel suite he'd hired.  He and Charity are going to do "it" for the first time.  Unfortunately, it's not really Charity, but still Zombie Charity (the real Charity has been trapped in ice since some time (real time) last year.)  (Recap - Zombie Charity was created by Kay to be horrible to Magill so Key could have him.)  Now Zombie Charity wants to sleep with (do "it") with Magill and then he'll die (for some reason.)  Anyway, Reese accused Tabitha of being a witch at Charity's party and she's like, I just made the tea with Junniper Berries.  So Reese (and his little friend, Jessica who wants to be with Reese, but Reese thinks he's going out with Kay) look up Junniper Berries on his Palm Pilot and so Tabitha is off the hook, because the guests whose tea was read were merely haluncinating.  But, as Reese reads later, the berries also bring out the "demon" in people.  So the show cuts to Magill and Charity (really Zombie Charity) in a spa.  She is about to give him a back rub when she lifts out her hand and it is .... a DEMON hand!  That was yesterday's episode.  Today Zombie manages to convince Magill to put a face washer over his eyes, (because she's all virginal and shy) and not look while she gets out of the water that has been contaminated with the berries.  Man, there were some lame special effects.  Kay rang around the hotels in Harmony (the town they live in - kinda like Sunnydale when it comes to weird stuff) and found out where Magill and Zombie Charity were.  Then she tried to drive there real quick.  But she was pulled over by a cop who turns out to be Zombie Charity....  What will happen tomorrow?  Invention for the day: Small Neon signs that sit above people when they've done something to their appearance so that everyone can complement them on their changes.

       Thesis Update.   Saw Dirk this afternoon.  He's like, your thesis is done, proof read it and hand it in.  Sure, you're going to keep getting ideas, but it's finished.  Deal.  Print it out and hand it in and stop stressing.  So, I have proof read it, changed it a tiny bit and sent it out to various fans to read.  Now I can work on Animal Minds with a clear conscious.  Or something.  Well, I could do but my brain is still covered in fog from my cold.

       Sunday.   Failed to go to church.  I still have a cold and feel snuffly and achy.  Benji and I went to Borders at Chadstone the Fashion Capital.  I used the gift vouchers I got for my birthday to buy a book.  Thanks to David, Kellie, Greg and Felicity.  Sat around and watched a DVD in the afternoon and then had a snooze.  Went to Polly's place and watched Eurovision.  We all wanted the Ukraines to win, so it was pretty neat when they did.  All the yucky ballads were punished really badly.  Norway came last with 3 votes, compared to the Ukraine who had 280 votes.  Some of the countries just voted for their neighbours, like Latvia, but the commentator made a joke out of it.   Semester 1, Week 11, Day 1.   Now usually I spend my blog post on Day 1 of any given week panicing about how many weeks there are to go.  I think I'm just too sick to be bothered.  My thesis is good enough.  I will send it out to be proof read after I see Dirk this afternoon.  I am happy enough with it.  Any more work on it will just break it.  Animal Minds essay has a plan.  I just need to fill in the blanks and have a neat idea or two.  Value Theory essay is unstarted.  But I know I am going to write on Korsgaard and Normativity, so that's all good.  I really just need to chill out, kick this cold and do some work.  There's nothing particularly hard about it.  So, that all being said:  2 weeks until Thesis is due. 4 weeks until my essays are due.  Easy.  Invention for the day: Instant Kill-a-Cold.

       Saturday.   Jeanie and I drove to Shepparton, took about three hours.  We walked around for a bit and had lunch.  They brought me my lunch, then took it away because it had a hair.  Then Jeanie had her lunch, ate it and then they brought me my lunch again, minus hair.  Then we went to a heavy metal t-shirt, piercing and "oil burner" shop.  Jeanie had her eye-brow pierced by a guy with a patch over one eye and we interupted his coffee.  I didn't have anything pierced.  Then we drove back again.  Yay.  I am utterley riddled with a cold virus thing.  Last night I took the "night time" tablets and was completely knocked over by the antihysterminey thing.  I couldn't move much and I was very spacey.  Invention for the day: Day time and Night time cold and flu tablets for people who are hypersensitive to antihystermines and pseudoeffedrein.  Yeah.

       Semester 1, Week 12, Day 5.   Despite it being like, the end of the penultimate week of semester, I have done very little in the way of work today.  I did end up finishing my book in a lovely hot bath, which was rather relaxing.  I looked over my Animal Minds essay and decided that my Conclusion should be expanded into the essay and I should delete the other 4000 words.  Sigh.  What I should really do is work on my Value Theory essay, otherwise I'll have nothing to hand in at all.  I was going to start reading it, but I was distracted by my book and being in pain.  Sigh.  I had a bit of a drama this morning, but it is too personal and complex to blog about.  Just teasing ya!  Invention for the day: Smug Git Eliminator - made from the latest Nurf Technology.

       Semester 1, Week 12, Day 4.   Slept in until 10:30.  Still nasty head ache - lots more ibuprofen.  (What is in neurofen.)  Worked a bit on Animal Minds essay (I wrote a conclusion) and meant to start reading for Value Theory, but instead I read my Heyer book.  Lost in Civ III, I was trying for a Diplomatic Victory but everyone voted for Alexander the Great.  If my last name was "the Great" then they might have voted for me!  Hey, if Alexander the Great married Mary Queen of Scots, then she'd be Mary Queen of the Great.  I am about to have Ultra Choc Sarah Lee Icecream.  Ha!  Invention for the day: Chocolate Mud Cake that is so dense that it threatens to change the Earth's orbit.

       Semester 1, Week 12, Day 2.   Went to bed with a headache and woke up with a really stiff neck and massive headache.  Was alleviated by ibuprofen.  Yum.  Had lunchies at Wholefoods with Sascha for like, three hours.  It was great to catch up with him.  Went to Benji's.  Achieved Diplomatic Victory in Civ III - I am now Ainsley the Pathetic (a step up from Ainsley the Worthless).  I was covered in lipstick marks at the end (better than bruises which is my normal state of affairs...)  Singing was good.  A little low on attendance, especially when the choir is split for one of the songs we're doing.  Got there in the end.   Semester 1, Week 12, Day 3.   Spent this morning sitting around chatting to my house mate Hannah and her girlfriend.  She is really nice - a computer geek from RMIT doing a Masters in Applied Science.  Spent a few hours on Animal Minds essay.  I think it's fit enough to hand in, but it's not brilliant.  I have one thought and a lot of exposition.  Still, it's better than the writers explanation of their ideas, so maybe it will do.  Checked the mail.  I got something that wasn't a bill or bank statement!  It was from  urlLink Plan .  I got a letter from my sponsored child!  Yay!  She is four years old and from Cambodia.  The picture was of a tracing of her hand and coloured in orange.  Neat.  I sent her some star stickers ages ago, but I'm not sure if she ever got them.  And a letter, but she wouldn't be able to answer that.  Her mum hopes she will go to school and she says she wants to be a teacher.  I have a photo of her and of her and her family.  (Incase you're wondering, I went with Plan rather than World Vision because my folks sponsor through them, they're non-religious and it was four dollars cheaper per month...  Sad.)  Invention for the day: Cure for Cancer.

       Semester 1, Week 12, Day 1.   Second last week of the semester.  Whoop-dee-doo.  Worked on my Animal Minds essay a bit.  If only it wasn't so crap, I'd say it was done.  I've almost written the right number of words, it's just that it's completely lack lustre and repetitive.  Like this blog sometimes.  Read more of my Georgette Heyer book,  Frederica .  Played Civ III on my new account on Benji's computer.  Yay.  Invention for the day:  Screw the Tim Tams.  A packet of Natural Confectionary Company Sour Worms that never runs out.

       Saturday.   Still not feeling that amazing.  I may never be well again.  Went into the city with Benji.  Walked around a lot, had lunch and many deep and meaningful conversations.  Went to Polly and Vivienne's dinner at Sofia's on Ferntree Gully Road.  Who would have thought that one restaurant in the sticks would have people parking in a paddock?  The food may be bountiful and cheap, but it's not that great.  Spent the later part of the evening watching  Interview with the Vampire .  I always thought that film gets about 3/4 of the way through and then decides it wants to end really quick and kind of rushes it.  But I suppose once Louis loses Claudia there's not much left for him to do except watch bad films with the sunshine in them.  (Surely one could watch the sun without being in the sun.  Does sunscreen work on vampires?)  It is kind of the opposite to  Buffy  - in that in Buffy lots of vamps get killed, whereas in  Interview lots of humans get killed.  Obviously both is a bit true, humans and vampires die in both.  But I made the comment at the start of the film.   Sunday.   Once again, failed to go to church.  This time, I lay in bed for two hours after the alarm went off just listening to the radio and being very warm and comfy.  Benji pumped up my bike tires and we rode around the block!  Yay - I rode for the first time in five months, pretty much exactly.  It was just like riding a bike.  My hand/wrist was fine.  So now all I need is a day that is nice (in about three months) and I can go for another ride.  I am very unfit.  Not sure what I'm doing for the rest of today.  Trying not to think about my stupid essays.  Invention for the day:  Sunscreen for vampires.  Apologies: To Jeanie for breaking her brain with my thesis.

       Essay Update.   Wrote more on my essay.  I just need to write a conclusion... then polish.  "In conclusion, this guy is a goik, lots of love, Ainsley."  Hmmm, maybe not.  Wordage: 3822 (excluding footnotes) and 4165 (including footnotes)  So things go well.  I am much more inspired and I think it is a much better essay than that crap I wrote for Animal Minds.  Plan is to finish this one and then go back and work on other one.  Things go well.

       Semester 1,Week 13, Day 5.   Last day of semester!!  Only seven more days to go until I need to hand in everything!!!!  (Blurk.)  My brain is spaghetti.  I have written and re-arranged.  I shall never ever get there.  It's still better than that crap I wrote for Animal Minds though.  This one has an argument in it.  Oooooh.  Update more later.  Invention for the day: Reusable paper coffee filters.  We're out.

       Semester 1, Week 13, Day 4.   Third day of Winter. Only 89 more days to go.  (Still on nasty anti-biotics but still feeling okay.  Neck a little stiff, handbag much too heavy.)  Used my new visa card to pay oodles of car related expenses.  Joy and rapture.  Spent most of the day writing my Value Theory essay.  Wrote another 1600 words, plus some outliney stuff.  Up to about 3000 words.  Hopefully I'll have a good day tomorrow and I'll be at the editting and refining stage for both essays.  Went up to Box Hill, met Benji there for coffee.  Then he and I went to my folks place.  We went to Taco Bills for dinner, then back to their place.  Just got home.  Phew.  It's cold out there!  It's like less than 10 degrees.  Invention for the day:  Small ray gun that allows bus drivers to silence insolent school children.

       Semester 1, Week 13, Day 3.   Second day of Winter.  Only 90 more days to go.  For the first time possibly ever, I am not ill or in pain.  Yay team!  (Still on nasty anti-biotics though.)  I broke my visa card in half.  It expired on Monday and I had tried to use it twice since then.  (Last time it expired, I had ridden down from Abbotsford to Black Rock and tried on some really nice cycling gear only to find I couldn't pay for it.  So I rode to Sandringham, caught the train home then drove back to Black Rock and paid and collected the clothes.  Then I drove to Whittlesea and back so I could see my folks (and probably do some washing - cause that's the kinda gal I am.))  What did I do today?  Well my friends (and other lurkers - you know who you are), I spent the entire day working on my Value Theory essay.  That's right, from about when I got up this morning and started work at 9:00 until about 4:30 when I was a little hungry and a bit jack of it.  End Result of all my Labour:  An outline to help me write stuff - 820 words (823). Beginnings of an essay - 1400 words (1396).  Phew.  I have a pretty scrappy introduction, but seeing I don't know what I'll conclude, that seems fair.  Plus I have pretty much completed the exposition of Korsgaard's account of normativity.  Gees it's complex - elegant and consistent but complex none the less.  Tomorrow I plan to go over the criticisms as presented by a guy called Silverstein.  I will argue that he is a goik and that the bit where he goes that he will not explore some area of her theory is like, crucial to her point and therefore he is a big goik.  I seem to have done something horrible to my internet setting which means google and dictionary refuse to work.  Now I will never know what goik means, if it means anything at all.  Sigh.  Goik goik goik.  (It's probably some swear word in some language that means that my blog will come up in google, but I won't know because my google doesn't work.)  I don't think that any of my friends think that normativity must be objective, quite the opposite in fact.  So why Goikness goiks on about objectivity and has a bit of a cry is really weird.  I think he's just a big Velleman fan.  Double sigh.  Invention for the day: Just one thing that is objective and enough distance and I can move the whole world.  (Thanks to Hannah for this idea.)  Brain breaker:  Is inter-subjectivity the same as objectivity?  Why or why not?

       Semester 1, Week 13, Day 2.   First day of Winter.  This time last year was the Sunday before I had my last week of work.  Did manage to do some work today, as I was up at 6:30 in the morning - couldn't sleep.  Unfortunately by about 8:30 I was in agony and calling the doctors, managed to get a 9:30 appointment.  I was pretty impressed because this time of semester they're uterly packed.  Spent most of the day in agony (after seeing doctor) watching  Futurama  with Benji (who took the day off to nurse me - which was lovely.)  So, now I feel like I'm really behind.  I haven't written any words on my essay, though it is coming together in my brain.  I am trying to formulate a title and question that will help me keep on track when I write and not just blither on about crap.  So far it's something like "Identity and Normativity" but that doesn't mean that much.  Had a snooze before singing.  I needed it after getting up earlier than I can remember.  Possibly the earliest since I left work.  Singing was good, though perhaps a little under-attended.  Still, as long as there's another alto (which is what I am - oh the glory), I'm happy.  Invention for the day: Instant anti-biotics for the bacteria holocaust of a lifetime.  (Sometimes I couldn't care less how many good bacteria they kill.)

       Semester 1, Week 13, Day 1.   Spent the day reading for my Value Theory essay.  Read articles and book by Christine Korsgaard, who considers that personal identity is constructed through the agent choosing public reasons to act.  Also read some stuff against her view, which I am unconvinced by.  Watched a bit of  Futurama  that Hannah had on DVD.  Made Mexican food for dinner.  Invention for the day: Career chips.

      Had dinner with Jeanie, Damien and Benji on Friday night.  It was really nice.   Saturday.   Got up early (like at 8:00) and went to the Dentist.  Benji and I now have immaculate teeth.  Went to Chadstone.  I asked about my mobile phone (which turns off when I'm talking to someone even though it has plenty of charge left, unless it's plugged in.)  The guy said I'd have to have a technician look at it and seeing it was three years old, I should just get a new one.  I said he was just trying to sell me something.  He said he was.  Sigh.  So I looked at mobile phones, which all suck at the moment.  Well, I have a Nokia 3310.  Last month I made like $4.00 worth of calls, and sure, maybe if it didn't turn off when I was trying to talk to someone, I'd make more calls.  So I would only want like a $20 plan.  I ended up looking at getting a prepaid phone for about $100 (a Nokia 3315) and swapping the sim card.  I want to keep my number.  Anyway had a long discussion with Benji about the advantages and disadvantages of making things that last forever vs disposable things that you can upgrade.  I am pretty miffed.  I really like my phone and I don't require amazing things like colour screen and poloyphonic ring tones.  I am really a luddite at heart.  I can't even figure out half the time how to use Benji's phone because it has six buttons (up, down, left menu option, right menu option, red hang up and green call/pick up) instead of my phone which has four (up, down, menu option and cancel.)    Grrr.  I am not waiting for my next pay, as I don't have pay days so I should just cough up the dough and get on with it.  Instead I am angry that my three year old phone is broken.  The guy's like, Does it annoy you enough to want to do something about it?  And I said, Well, I'm here aren't I?  Maybe I was a bit rude.  I guess if I shunted up to a computer sales guy, put my 386 on the counter and said, Er, there's something wrong with my computer.  He'd be like, Yes, it's 11 years old and it was time to move on like 9 years ago.  If phone contracts are 24 months, is that how long a phone is supposed to last for?  That's pretty crappy.  No wonder Planet Ark is trying to recycle them.  Would I pay for robustness?  I guess not.  If my phone hadn't been SMS enabled I would have wanted a new phone.  It is possible that there is a technological feature that may develop that I would be prepared to upgrade for.  (I can't think of what this would be.  Colour screen, polyphonic ringtone, better games and camera is not it though.)  So I went and spent $80 on clothes instead.  Benji and I had a lovely pasta meal for dinner with a bottle of red.   Sunday.   Went to church.  After having failed to go for two weeks, the minister urged the congregation to get excited about our Christianity and turn up on time.  Sigh.  I need at 11:30 service.  Sleeping in until 10 would almost be alright.  In a bit of a grump all day really.  Not that I felt guilty or anything about not going to church, more that I was uninspired and the singing was particularly painful.  (The band seems to be lead by a guitarist who disagrees with the singer about when to come in.)  Benji's folks and brother came up to Melbourne and we went out for dinner at the River Kwai, which was pretty nice.   Other Stuff.   Both the past two nights I've woken up in a bit of a panic as I realise that I'm not working hard enough on these two essays and I'm chucking it in.  Well, certainly won't get a first if I slacken off and hand in crap.  Do I care?  Yes, I am a perfectionist who is certain to fail (get a second) so I don't care.  Ha huh!  Do I care?  I'm utterly sick of it and the thought of continuing on and writing more philosophy makes me gag.  I can't stand reading it, I hate the thought of writing it.  It's dedious beyond belief and pointless beyond comprehension.  Besides, as my mother pointed out so fruitfully at the beginning of honours when I went to Adelaide, it won't help society in any real way.  Even if I did write something brilliant in Ethics.  What would I do if I didn't do Masters?  Get a full time job, get a mortgage and go on the Great Vic and Tassie bike rides.  And if I did Masters?  Get a part time, write a thesis and go on the Great Vic and Tassie bike rides.  So what bothers me?  That I am no closer to deciding what I would do than the day I wrote an email asking for a redundency package, but I am significantly poorer.  Invention for the day: Feature that would make it worth while upgrading my mobile phone for.  What I would like: To be inspired.  To be inspired to finish (/start) my essays.  To be inspired to do something afterwards.  The latter can wait until I come back from Cairnes, though it does make me desperately uncertain and consequently, very unhappy.

       Rest of Yesterday.   I spent the rest of yesterday shopping at Chadstone The Fashion Capital (all I bought was lunch, but I had a look for bathers.  In winter?  Ha!)  Spent a fair bit of time in Borders too.  Went up Glenferrie Road and looked at lots of book shops and Spotlight and such.  Bought dinnery things.  Came home and Benji made this really yummy quiche like thing (with puff pastry.)

       Week 1 after Semester, Thursday.   Blurk.  Slept terribly and woke up miserable after a minor nervous break down last night.  Still, things are good.  Ripped out the unworkable crap that was the conclusion I wrote yesterday and plugged something worthwhile in.  I think I have finished my Animal Minds essay.   Things.   So, how does this make me feel?  Well, finishing things is usually kind of frustrating really.  By the time one finishes something, one is already  way  over it.  I am pretty over it.  So I don't feel relieved (partly because I have not handed it in and I'm not full of vodka.)  Instead I feel like I'm standing on the edge of the abyss.  Not quite.  More accurately, I would describe my situation as follows:  You know  Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade ?  (If not, go watch it.  It has Harrison Ford in it.  Just ignore that horrible Scott who thinks he can play a sophisticated Englishman.)  Well, when they get to the place of the Holy Grail, there are those three tests.  I feel like I am at the third test, the Leap of Faith.  Now, when one stares at the abyss, it looks like you will fall but there is this bridge that goes over it that looks like the other side of the chasm.  Except that I feel like I leapt twelve months ago and now I am just hoping like hell that the bridge really is there, because that's what I was counting on.  Faith is tricky.    This is certainly not the first time I've wrenched my life (kicking and screaming) onto some alternative path.  These things require tremendous self assurance (that you are doing the right thing, that you're capable of the new thing you're going to do).  At the same time, one can't help thinking that you're really relying on a fair bit of luck.  Sometimes the coincidents in life are just a little too suspcious.  So on the one hand, one requires strength and self assurance.  One also requires weakness and acceptance so that the threads that are your life can be woven together by (insert Lady Luck, Fates, God, your favourite guiding star or angel here.)  In a way, you can't just rely on yourself because things will happen that are outside your control to you.  On the other hand, you can't just ride the wave hoping for the best.  I guess this is where the river analogy comes in.  Moving forward on the river, so your ultimate path is picked out, but whether you move quickly or slowly or near the shore in the snags or out in the deep is up to you.  In a way this is just true.  The fact that one is human and one is aging forces one's life in a direction.  Not just human needs and human psychology (that is our common fate) that takes you along the river, but causes and changes too.  When my arm was broken I wanted strength to get through it.  It was only when I stopped fighting and worrying and accepted that I was going to probably have surgery that I found peace and was contented.  But letting go is hard.  Having faith that things are "just going to work out" does not sit intuitively.  The river flows and sometimes you have to stop fighting the current, sure.  But if you get snagged, there's going to be a lot of work, so best to plan now.  Benji and I listed my stresses last night.  Just under "essay" came "career".  I don't know what this means exactly.  It's the non-Benji focus of my life that gives me a feeling of self-worth and isn't just a hobby.  (Don't know what I say "just a hobby" that in itself requires examination.)  But I don't know what it is I'm going to do!!!!!!  Ah well.  Enough gibber.  Invention for the day: Small little hearts in your wrists that give the blood an extra pump to the tips of your fingers where they are oh so cold.

       Finday continued.   Went to Knox Shopping Centre.  (It is like Chadstone the Fashion Capital, only not as good.)  Attempted to get underground parking, but gave up and just had normal above ground parking.  It wasn't raining too hard when came out of shops.  Friday night I was pretty depressed about "The Future"TM.   Saturday.   Had a terrible nights sleep.  Woke up in agony and couldn't move randomly as part of my back had gone spastic and would randomly spasm.  (Are "spastic" and "spasm" related?  They are good back describing words.)  Benji got me a hot water bottle and managed to get me into a position that wasn't too painful.  Eventually fell asleep.  Woke up in much less pain, but still sore.  Went to Knox Shopping Centre again, believe it or not.  Went to another wedding for Rob and Simone, Benji's friends.  Bought food and had Jeff round for dinner and a game of  Settles of Catan.   Early night.   Sunday.   No more anti-biotics!  Yay!  Woke up early in even less pain, so managed to go to church.  It was quite good.  Hung around afterwards for soup and sandwhiches.  Then went to Jeanie and Matt's place.  Missed Jeanie, but sat with Matt for three hours chatting to him.  Left just before Jeans arrived.  Made it back to Benji's place just after Jeanie rang.  Rang Jeans.  Arranged to have dinner with her and Matt.  Sat around playing bass guitar with Benji until it was dinner time.  Had lovely dinner with Jeanie and Matt.  Sat and watched  Music Max  until  Star Trek .  Invention for the day: (I know I said I wouldn't use familiars for these, but....)  A familiar that plays your boyfriends computer games for him, so he doesn't have to.  (I'm not bitter.)

I spent most of the day being strung out and thinking that I was an unemployed nothing and that even Monash IT was rejecting me.  Now it turns out it was all a mistake.  I am an unemployed nothing, but Monash IT loves me none the less.  Yay for me!  (One more sleep until Cairns.  Hopefully I will get  some  sleep.)

      Monday's Forecast: Cairns 26. Melbourne 15.   Saturday.   Got up late.  Yay.  Went and had afternoon tea with a bunch of ladies in Frankston.  Yum.  Chilled out chatting to Benji and an early night.   Sunday.   Went to church this morning.  It was really interesting and the music was good.  Went to Chadstone and bought some stuff including a card.  Went to Monash Medical Centre and saw Ken, who is still deathly ill.  Chilled out and had some lunch.  Now I'm all packed and ready to go to Cairns!!!  (Mmmm shiny.)  Invention for the day: Prepacked clothes.

       First Friday (Fifth Day) of Exhistenial Nhilism.   Well, it's like before 9:30 in the morning and I have achieved the only thing on my small victories list for today:  Rung Centrelink.  I now have an appointment for next Friday, at the other 8:45.  I think the trick was to do it before the sweet numbness of sleep had worn off and I could answer mechanically questions like "Are you total assets less than $100,000?" - "Yes" and "Have you been involved in a company or trust?" - "No" (Does working for one count?) "Do you live with a member of the opposite sex?" - "No" (But I do live with someone whose sexuality could include me as an object of attraction.)  I had to make coffee, just to make sure I wasn't dreaming.  Actually, it wasn't so bad.  I think that dealing with Centrelink brings back old hurts, where one remembers what it was like years ago trying to deal with them and trying to convince them that one was not scum, just a little down on one's luck.  These days I know I'm not scum and don't feel the need to convince anyone else of this fact (with the possible exception of my parents).    It is not necessarily humiliating, but it is certainly scuffs a bit of polish off the old pride.  Centerlink is the pinacle of equality, they treat everyone the same, which is unfortunate.  My next task is to hand in a bizillion copies (which is slightly less than trinfinity (my fave number)) (okay, four copies, but with more than eight signatures on each, I could have had hand cramp) of the freshly signed leases back to our new real estate agent for the new house.  New house, new house...  Mum has offered some floor rugs for the polished boards in the L-shaped living space.  I can't decide which room the piano should go into.  Going down to Benji's folks place tonight.  Back tomorrow.  Invention for the day: Discriminating Centrelink.

       First Thursday (Fourth Day) of Exhistenial Nhilism.   I have achieved many small victories.  I won a Diplomatic Victory in Civ III - I am now Ainsley The Foolish (neither pathetic nor worthless). We were accepted for the house Benji and I applied for yesterday.  I am about to go sign things and hand over large wads of cash.  Goody.  Have not rung Centrelink re: Newstart.  Invention for the day:  Personal cheques that could let the holder know that they would not bounce, thus being acceptable to people who are skeptical about personal cheques.

       Blog Reflection.   This blog was mostly a history of my year of honours.  (It was certainly honour-centric.) Now that it's over I am not sure what it shall evolve into.  Just a day to day diary I guess.  I wish I had a clear indication of what to do next.  I hate making real choices.  There is no clear path of least resistence.  Everything I could want to do will take effort and be a little painful (and scary.)  If you were me, what would you do?  Seriously.  Each choice also involves giving up other choices.  I could go back to some things or do some things later, but time is still moving forward...  I'm gibbering.

       First Wednesday (Third day) of Existenial Nhilism.   I achieved much in the small victories department.  I asked people to be my references. I put my name down for Newstart. I did a load of holiday washing (and hung out to dry.) I watched most of Season II  Black Adder . I gave notice to the real estate agent I am with. I saw a new house with Benji and applied for it.  Yay.... sigh.  Invention for the day: (Ripped off utterly from a beanie I saw)  Instant Human, just add coffee.

       Plan and News.   Benji and I are engaged.  He asked me near a waterfall near his folks place.  We are planning to get married late 2005.  Benji and I are moving in together.  We am looking for a house a little closer to his work.   First Tuesday (Second Day) of Existential Nhilism.   Spent this morning writing to my sponsored child.  She had sent me an outline of her hand, coloured in and everything, so I sent her one back, plus a letter with some of my big news.  Went looking at houses, may have found one that is suitable in Burwood.  The kitchen might be a bit weird though.  Still, it's gas through and through.  Drove a lot (did like 80km or so.)  Also, got a congrats email from Toby.  So I went and picked up my essays and thesis from uni.    Singing tonight.  Haven't been for two weeks, as on holidays.  Invention for the day: Mobile phone's that can estimate and display length of stand by and talk time available on flat looking battery.  Does anyone find four bars of indication more than moderately useful?

       First Monday of Existential Nhilism.   Went to Cairns, came back.  Started cleaning my room today.  Well, actually it's much much messier.  In actuality, I went through boxes that I have not looked at in years (despite moving them several times) and have sorted it into Keep, Chuck and Give piles.  Got a letter from my sponsored child.  She likes red and purple.  My kind of kid.   Summary of holiday.   Monday: Flew and Walked Tuesday: Biked and Booked Wednesday: Biked and Boated Thursday: Railed and Wired Friday: Scootered and Wiggled Saturday: Hired and Drove Sunday: Caffeinated and Photographed Monday: Wrote and Dreamed Tuesday: Grumped and Travelled Wednesday: Read and Relaxed Thursday: Hanglid and Drank Friday: Returned and Flew  That was it really.  Invention for the day: Everlasting Holiday (so much better than any gobstopper)

       Saturday.   Spent the day at the farm.   Sunday.   Church in the morning.  Lunch with parishoner in afternoon.  Lots of  Black Adder II  with Benji.   Monday.   Knitting and  Buffy .  Small victory for the day: Learning to knit and purl.  Invention for the day: Huh.  Like I have any ideas or inspiration.  Frankly it's a miracle that I'm writing in this blog.  Small nervous break down last night, feeling rather fragile.

       An Indefinate Wednesday    It's comforting to know that although 1/7 of your life is Monday, 1/14 of it is Friday night and another 1/14 is Saturday night.  Yay!  But when every day is like the weekend, except none of your friends are around (they seem to go to work...) you still have something to look forward to.  I had a spell at cleaning some of the things that weren't going to be packed - such as the bathroom, kitchen floor, bits of carpet.  On the weekend Benji and I had moved a smaller temporary fridge into the kitchen so that the older (in the been there longer sense of older), larger, fridge could be moved without disrupting Hannah's food, who's staying a bit longer.  Anyway, turns out that many things will come off walls with a damp sponge.  However the larger fridge is a rusty hunk o junk.  Went to clean the layer of slime that had developed under the rotter (aka vege crisper, but nothing gets crisper in there!  You should have seen the sentient life I had to dispose of!  Actually, it wasn't too bad.)  Spent some of today researching fridges.  So I went to The Goody Guys and Retrovision.  Retrovision was very helpful and not too pushy (I played my "must discuss with fiance" card to new shames to leave and have a think) but the Good Buys almost completely ignored me.  The first time I was there, the guy only asked if he could help when I stuck my head in between him and a fridge while he was talking to someone else and the second time no one even said Hi.   Maybe it's too aggressive to front up to a shop with a catalogue and a pen and paper, but if a purchase is more than say $50 and is not clothes/shoes related, it's worth shopping around for.  (Retrovision will give me free delivery, planning on going back tomorrow.)  I thought one where the fridge would be on top would be ideal (I also wanted one that's left handed, open fridge with left hand, remove milk with right makes sense to me!)  But they're more expensive than "normal" fridges... and don't get as many stars (chew up more power).  This seemed a bit odd at first, seeing cold air sinks, so surely you would want the freezer at the bottom.  But I figure that normal fridges work by freezing air and letting it sink.  Must must must get frost free!!!  Also minor dilemna over old fridge, but new municipality is having a hard rubbish collection day in early August.  But as it's technically my brother's fridge, I shall contact him first.  Invention for the day:  Self cooling food.  Duh.

       Since I last wrote.    Benji and I got the keys to our new place in Burwood.  Picked up the keys.  Since then have been doing a thousand small things and moving a rather large amount of stuff.  I resolved to go through my stuff and throw a lot of it out.  Some of this I have achieved.  Things tend to go into three piles 1. Definately Keep 2. Rubbish  3.  I don't know.  The I don't know pile can be further broken down into 1. The Salvos would take this 2.  I am keeping this purely for sentimental reasons and I shouldn't and 3.  This is stuff that I could need ANY MINUTE NOW!!!  All very silly.    Plans for the future.    Oh if only it was that easy.  I am organising our engagement party in September (on Grand Final Day - it's tradition.)  No other definate plans, some exploration.  Ivention for the day:  Self packing and sorting house.  Or better still, a bin that knows what you want to throw out and goes and gets the stuff itself.
