      Good news!&nbsp; I passed the School of Accountancy.&nbsp; I found out Friday at 10:00am at work.&nbsp; Noboby else was at work though because we had our Sports Day on Thursday and everyone took Friday off.&nbsp; Sports day was pretty fun.&nbsp; We played three games of baseball and three of volleyball.&nbsp; My baseball team won every game and were the champs, hooray!  Boy was I sore on Friday, I actually had to lift my own legs into the car driving to work Friday morning.&nbsp; Friday night Rachelle and I headed to London for some partying.&nbsp; We went to the beach on Lake Erie Saturday with Tim, Wendy and Greg.&nbsp; It wasn't spectacular, but we had a good time.&nbsp; Tim and Wendy had a fantastic barbecue back at their place where we were joined by Chris, Jenn and Kyle.&nbsp; Afterwards we got into the bubbly and the sparkly and the brown stuff and headed to the bar.&nbsp; This was one of the few occasions in London that we didn't end up going to Molly Blooms - I think we went to T.Js or something like that.&nbsp; It was a good time, but after the bar we were walking over to Molly Blooms where Greg and Chris had taken off to.&nbsp;   On our way we ran into Greg who had just been kicked out of Molly Blooms for puking -hahaha.&nbsp; As we were walking a train was comming and in our drunken stupour, we decided to run and beat it.&nbsp; When I was crossing the tracks I remember looking up and the train was about 40ft from me -&nbsp;man was that stupid!!!&nbsp; Anyway, I learned something from that - don't be retarded, be cool stay in school!

      Last weekend we went up to maskoka to Stacey's cottage.&nbsp; It was unbeleivable, now I know how the wealthy live.&nbsp; If you think of a really nice cottage, their boat house was better than that!&nbsp; It was a mansion on the lake basically and furnished as one.&nbsp; There were five bedrooms and each one had its own bathroom.&nbsp; Even the boat house had a kitchen and bathroom in it.&nbsp; They had all the toys too, two sea-doos, two power boats with tubing and wake boarding.&nbsp; It was fantastic - and the weather was amazing.&nbsp; I had never been tubing before but it got my adrenaline going.&nbsp; Stacey's whole purpose was to make me fly off, but I held on for my life.  There was another couple up for the weekend too, Henry and his gal.&nbsp; We all jumped off the top of the boat house (they had a patio up there with a door that swung open).&nbsp; The water was apparently 20ft deep there so it was safe.&nbsp; I got a few brews in me and decided to do a front flip off the boathouse, which was about 20ft up from the water.&nbsp; I thought to myself, I don't want to over flip and land on my face because that would hurt like a mofo.&nbsp; So I ended up under flipping and landed flat on my back from 20ft up!&nbsp; Did that ever hurt like a mofo!  What a fun weekend, I hope Stacey invites us up again!&nbsp; My arms are still hurting though from hanging onto the tube!  Oh, check out this story on Ken Jennings called The Summer of Jeopardy Guy.&nbsp; It is pretty funny.&nbsp;  urlLink http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/040721   Cheers, Carter

      I woke up this morning tired and groggy just like everyday and managed to stumble into the shower.  I heard the phone ring just as I turned on the water but figured Rachelle could rollover and answer it easier than me making a mad dash out of the bathroom, and a wet mess to clean up.   I thought to myself - who would be calling this early?  It must be either mom wanting to meet for lunch or something bad has happened.  I had that sick feeling that something was wrong and immediately thought of dad.  It has been in the back of my mind for two or three years now, that dad is getting older, still smokes and is a big man.  Sometimes I wonder how dad gets through life after the loss of his father - it was devastating even for me and I have no idea how I would be able to manage without my pop around. After I got out of the shower I asked Rachelle who phoned and she said mom.  I felt a little better because if something was wrong mom probably would say something to Rachelle.  I called mom back after I got dressed and had some orange juice to see if she wanted to meet for lunch, but the news was bad - dad had a heart attack about 2am and mom had taken him to emergency.  She said he was scheduled to see the specialist around 9:00 and was doing ok.  I kept my composure on the phone with mom, but when I hung up I lost it.  After a few momments I went to tell Rachelle who was still in bed and wept on her shoulder before going to the hospital. When I arrived he was in the ICU and hooked up to a bunch of wires and machines.  He had an ultrasound done and they don't think any damage has occured.  He is hopefully going to Kingston tomorrow for more testing.  It was really tough seeing him with all the wires attached.  You grow up thinking your dad is superman and it is devastating when you realize he is mortal.  Hopefully everything turns around and he quits smoking and becomes more active again.  I am praying it is just a blessing in disguise.

      I came across an old 'Carter and Sawchuck' email from back in second year university, roughly from sometime in 1999.  I think it is pretty funny, so it will be my first posting.  Here it is:  Well everybody, it's been almost a year, but Carter and Sawchuck are  back and this time they are competing! You see, the Longwood porn email  account has been revived for our third year of school and the coveted  position of the sole accesser is now up for grabs.  To keep in the  spirits of all of the political action of late, Carter and Sawchuck will  respond to a series of questions as asked by an independent review panel  (actually the panel is not that independent, as it actually only  consisted of Carter, Sawchuck, Fat-Drew Evans, and Acknew Panacknew (Sofie  Panou)).  After reading the responses to the questions as answered by  Carter and Sawchuck, we encourage you to vote for one of the candidates by  responding to Sofie's new email account:  pasta_without_any_sauce@yahoo.com  We hope that your responses will include both the name of your favoured  candidate and the reason for your selection.  Also, any respondents who  can successfully guess what Sofie's favourite meal is will be treated  to a special dinner prepared by Sofie herself.  Good luck in your  endeavor and feel free to include comments about Carter, Sawchuck, Fat-Drew,  and Sofie in your responses!  (Each question will be answered by both candidates in no more than 3  sentences with the exception of the 9th and final question, which can be  answered in 5 sentences.)    1) Do you believe in homosexuals?  Carter:  If you saw two guys named Hambone and Flippy, which one would  you think liked dolphins the most?  I'd say Flippy, wouldnt you?  You'd  be wrong though, it's Hambone.  Therefore I believe in homosexuals.   One time I left my tooth under my pillow and the next morning it was gone, so there has to be homosexuals!  Old, Old Homosexuals!!  Sawchuck:  Why yes, yes I do believe in homosexuals.  I believe that  homos have a distinct place in our society, and I believe that they  deserve the same amount of respect that we have for racists, criminals, and  pedophiles.  Hey homos, if you vote for me I promise more re-runs of  Ellen, more radio-play for K.D. Lang, and free penis-enlargers for all of  the Canadian gay men (I mean, who wants to be smaller than their  mate?!)   2) What are your views on costume apparel and sex?  Sawchuck:  I believe that costume apparel and sex share a strong  correlation since I both dress in costume and have sex on an average of one  time a year.  I also feel that wearing costume apparel can reduce  prejudice when chosing a sexual partner because the costume hides facial  deformities.  It's hard to believe, but when dressed is costume, even  Fat-Drew Evans is able to get laid!  Carter:  As some of you may know, I have an extensive background in costume apparel and sex.  Being the university mascot I am very popular with the ladies, especially when (how you doin') I wear my costume to bed ;)  But overall, you can't win friends with salad, so life is short - party naked!   3) Do you believe that our youth is being corrupted by pre-marital sex?   Carter:  On a scale of one to crazy monkey perverted sex, our youth  scores a perfect crazy monkey perverted sex.  Sawchuck:  I believe that pre-marital sex is a key to promoting strong,  competent leaders for tomorrow.  I even believe that we should take it  one step further and promote insestuous behaviour.  I mean, if fathers  would take the time to teach their daughters the proper way to please a  man, we could cut the statistics for domestic violence and abuse in  half!  4) Do you believe that alcohol plays a role in drunk driving?  Sawchuck:  I do not see alcohol as being a factor in the large number  of accidents involving drunk drivers.  I believe that the problem is  actually with the high number of sober drivers on the road.  I mean, if  you fuckers stayed off the road, we couldn't crash into you now could  we?!  Carter:  Itâ€™s fascinating to think that all around us there's an invisible world we can't see.  I'm speaking of course, of the World of the Invisible Scary Skeletons.   5) Would you force jawbreakers into the mouths of hamsters if it  ensured a healthy future for Canada's homeless?  Carter:  No, hamsters are evil evil creatures of satan. Instead of feeding the hamsters the jawbreakers, I would feed the hamsters to the homeless, that way, the homeless could live in the hamster cages and the evil hamsters would join the prince of darkness in hell for eternity!  Sawchuck:  I see this question as producing a significant conflict of  interest because it directly opposes the homeless and gay communities.   You see, if you do force the jawbreakers into the mouths of the  hamsters, you would likely kill them, thus reducing the hamster population,  which in turn would decrease the single gay man's ability to pleasure his  rectum.  I'd propose to stick the jawbreakers into the mouths of gay  men, because, as we are all aware, they are quite capable of having large  balls forced into their mouths.   6) Is it politically correct to pierce your household pet?  Sawchuck:  Before I answer this question, I would like to make you  aware of the fact that I saw Carter masterbating onto a dog with only three  legs!  He was yelling, "So, you think I walk funny eh!  Well you're a  real funny fuck aren't you?"  Then he kicked the dog in it's only  remaining hind leg and held a microphone up to its mouth as it painfully  moaned, "Ruff ruff ruff, bark bark, ggggrrrrrr, ruff!"  Carter:  I personally questioned my dog on this, and I quote â€œRuff ruff ruff, bark bark, ggggrrrrrr, ruffâ€™  I can not dispute this argument that my dog has raised, I mean, it is their own choice.  In this day of age you can not discriminate and if my dog wants a clit ring it is going to get one damn it!   7) How would you could increase the sanitation levels of public  washrooms in Canada?  Carter:  I think university and college administrators should encourage students to urinate on the walls and bushes, because then when students from other universities come sniffing around, theyâ€™ll know this is someone elseâ€™s territory.  Sawchuck:  I believe that sanitation levels are already extremely high  in existing public washrooms (or at least we pretend they are!)  I  mean, guys, you all know that you are only washing your hands afterwards  because there are other people around!  Truthfully, we all know that when  you turn away from that urinal you look around, and if there's no one  else there, you just zip 'er up and bolt outta there like you haven't  done anything wrong!  I know that when I finish on the toilet, if nobody  is around, I rub my sweaty sack on the toilet seat until it is  coverered with a thick film of nut-butter!   8) Do you believe that time should be standardized?  Sawchuck:  Frankly, I'm sick and tired of all of this crazy talk about  standardization!  If we are going to standardize anything, it should be  school uniforms.  How much more fun would school be if we were forced  to dress up in only plastic grocery bags (wrestler style) and march  around chanting, "Skin and Bones, Skin and Bones, that's all we are, is  Skin and Bones!"  Carter:  All I have to say isâ€¦ Nigga please!   9) How long would it take to blow up a Nunavutian baby dressed in a  Eskimo-baby-suit, who was put in the microwave at power level 8? (The baby  is 7 lbs 6 oz, and 73 % water)  Carter:  This is a trick question because there is no height specified.  If the baby is long, it will have to be folded up to fit in the microwave.  This will cause the babies skin to press against the walls of the microwave, therefore causing friction and the skin to cook faster than a non-long baby.  If the babyâ€™s skin cooks faster, it will retain more heat and cause the babyâ€™s blood to boil faster, therefore causing the baby to blow up faster than a non-long baby.  Since the length of the baby is not included, I can not answer the question.  Sawchuck:  This question is a "no-brainer" for even the least  intellegent person, since all of the necesary information is laid out.  Since it  is specified that the Nunavutian baby is wearing an Eskimo-baby-suit  (which is only manufactured in sizes 4 through 6), it can be guarenteed  that the baby is of short stature and thus will not need to be folded.   Considering that the baby is 73% water, that means that r=0.73, and if  z = [1/2] x In[(1+r)/(1-r)], then the value for z would be 0.929.  Once  z is multiplied by .60 to standardize the time units, the resulting  answer in minutes is 0.5574.  Therefore, the baby would blow up in 33.444  seconds.  But what is really of concern is the fact that Carter says  this question cannot be answered...what are you trying to cover up  Carter?...how many fucking Nunavutian babies have you blown up you sick  fuck?!...Who got to you Carter?!...Who got to you?!   Well, if you've made it this far, you have surpassed where either  candidate expected you to read to!  Well done, but honestly, what a waste of  time eh?  No, fuck you!  It's not a waste of time because now it's time  to vote!  Remember send your votes and comments to:  pasta_without_any_sauce@yahoo.com  We will update you with the winner in one weeks time.
