      my parents just went to sleep, in different beds, in different rooms.  i hope i don't turn out like that.  sometimes when i'm falling asleep i think of people i used to cuddle up with, and it makes me sad.  but it just occurred to me; including childhood and being old and in between, modern women today might just spend more time sleeping alone than not.

      mollie, moriah and i went to a restaurant titled the "winward passage" this evening, which was full of old people, wood paneled walls, and overcooked vegetables. it was exactly what i needed on a dreary, rainy columbus night like this. i love thunderstorms, and never get to see them in socal. why can't i see a rainstorm instead of all this drizzle?  spent the rest of the night at janine's, drinking red wine, and seeing her new house. now that we're 25, everyone (especially my friends in columbus from hight school) are getting to be so damn  domestic.  a house. we grew up together. have been best friends since 4th grade. she owns a house, and i'm running around all summer sleeping with strippers named juan.   speaking of, in retaliation to last night's mean, mean email, said ex-boyfriend said he owes me nothing, he's glad we're not together, and called me a slut.   first i wasn't fucked up enough for him, and now i'm a slut. i could waste my time typing all of the reasons i dumped him in the first place, but he's not worth it. i can't believe i'm wasting this much time on him now.  maybe i need drama to survive?

      what happened to me?  i used to be so nice. too nice. i stayed with an asshole who wasn't good enough for me for too long, and just when i'm starting to get over him... i did a very un-Christian thing tonight.   i "accidentally" stumbled upon his weblog. not on purpose... not really. i was visiting a weblog of his friend and saw him connected, so of course i read it.   the internet is a dangerous thing.   in it he talked all about his new girlfriend,&nbsp;about how "it's always nice" to go over to her parents' house for dinner (what, did they start dating the night we broke up?), how they did this, that, blah blah, puke puke puke. i don't want him but the idea of him being with someone else makes me want to vomit. am i crazy?   in said weblog, he also referred to his "psycho ex-girlfriend" (aka me), which pissed me off but then i thought, he's right! i'm stalking him on the internet!   so i did what all sensible girls would do and in an email response to him from the other night, casually mentioned that i'd slept with someone else while we were dating, which is true, but i was never going to tell him. i didn't want to hurt him. but now i do.

      just got back from my family reunion. it seems they're getting older and shorter every year. it's always weird to me to have to introduce myself to relatives. i feel like we should just know who one another is, but we don't, so it's awkward. my aunt mabel brought a keyboard and was really getting down.  i drove with my mom and two of my cousins, and we talked the whole way about relationships and the like. i don't often hear my mom talk about such things, so it was fun but now i'm all hopped up on coffee with nowhere to go. it's another crappy day in columbus, which is why i appreciate the sun in la so much.  still thinking about the ex, with his new girlfriend. i fear he treats her better, although everyone tries to remind me that people don't change that fast.  last night i went to a party down in the victorian village and my friend brett showed up DRUNK, and started wrestling me. at first i thought it was funny but then he started getting a little too close; was it just me or was he trying to lick my neck? his hug goodbye was lingered a bit too long, too. he's probably lonely, but it was weird. he dated one of my best friends for over a year-i just can't see him that way.

      so i finally get an email from the ex that i dumped a few months ago. before and during our breakup he gave me all of these "people should stay friends even if it's really hard" speeches and then... nothing from him. and we were friends beforehand, so i've been kind of hurt.   i broke up with him because he wasn't good for me-cheap, stingy, closed off, anger issues-but didn't expect silence. then, and this is the danger of the internet, i check his friendster page and see that his status is "in a relationship." ahhh. bad memories of a girl from his photo class he was hanging out with before and RIGHT after our breakup came speeding back. again, i know i ended it, but he wasn't exactly begging me to stay, either.   so i emailed him, thanking him for not keeping in touch with me and for letting me find out via friendster that he's dating someone else. he emailed me back saying he needs his space, and i should respect that. i do.&nbsp;i will. the bastard just should've told me this in the first place...  is she prettier? smarter? funnier? does he love her?&nbsp;fucked up?  he accused me of being too balanced, too "normal." hope he's having fun in a dysfunctional relationship.

      today i decided to start a blog. mostly because i'm used to typing in my journal, as opposed to picking up a pen and doing it the old-fashioned way, and I'm at my mom's house, sans my jump drive. so here we are.
