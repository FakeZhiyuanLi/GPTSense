      That's right he does. I'll soon be done with Buttfuckiel Shitthorne's not-so-enthralling story of The Blithedale Romance. My hopeful prediction: everyone at the end has sex so much they all die and then explode, also killing a bunch of babies who were standing around them, as well as a few bunnies, and then that entire state catches fire. That is just my hopeful prediction, because that would be the ending necessary to tie up the most BORING SHIT I HAVE EVER READ IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE.   It's not just school assignments I procrastinate on, i've realized. Say if I feel like getting a coke. I wait until I NEED to have a coke, then I get one. While that should be for the better (it would lower the amount of coke I drink) I do the same with about everything else. Such as excreting waste. I wait until I REALLY have to pee, or until my bowels will explode with such force i'd be sent up through my roof (although I don't see how I shouldn't do that if I was on the toilet, but whatever the fuck ever).   So I'm listening to Burzum, the solo project of Varg V-somethingsomething, the old bass player of the band Mayhem, and it's good. The guy is fucking insane, what with having murdered Euronymous from Mayhem and also being, well, a nazi sympathizer (his last 2 shitty albums he only used a keyboard because he said the guitar and such were a nigger instrument and not made by norweigans or something like that) But in a couple songs before he got all racist and nazi-sympathizing were really good and melodic. The only problems I have on some are his shitty vocals..he just kinda screams (it's not a death/black metal growl, its sort of a high pitched whiny scream) and that could drone on your nerves, but the instrumental work is most excellent. He doesnt "sing" for long though, so if you can listen through those parts pretty quick you're into some nice stuff.  Ok I gots to play SW: KOTOR now, I mean I GOTS to, so seeya chumps.  -jedi style (that's with a lightsaber, you have to build up some caluses for that shit)

      So there I am, sitting, when I think, I'll make a Blog! So I did, wonderful eh? Yes, I think so too bitch. In time I'll fix it up and make it bitchin, but for now I will have to deal with its boring regularness.  I've decided school isn't so bad, even though I fret about it a whole lot, but it really is quite nice. Intellectual stimulation is good, and without it I can feel my brain get all lazy and shit. See? this writing is the result of lack of school, and i'll be damned if this is good writing. Well, let's be honest, I either need constant video game attention or occaisional school. Both work. I'm sure if Jesus were alive today, he would think religious hardcore music is stupid. I bet he'd say something like "What in the hell, all it is is dumb screaming and semi religious lyrics and horrible guitars with the occaisional standard hardcore riff, I mean, come on, can't you guys play something better?" I bet if Jesus were around, he would have musical TASTE man. He'd be into Steve Vai and Satriani and Moby and junk. But who doesn't like Moby? Moby brings the fat beats to the nation, and he does it BALD.  Do you think Vikings would have preferred Motorcycles had they been around? Sure, they would be on land, but that is sort of the tough guy thing to do, to have a bitchin' Harley with dead babies strapped to it. Vikings today would not put up with all that stupid emo bullshit, they'd just pull out a shotgun and get to the laying-waste. I think that if a nuclear holocaust comes up, first thing I do, is re-instate the Viking Order, because if I get a few badass dudes on my side, I'm bound to have more, then all those Doomsday cults wont be after my shit so bad when I've got big ass biker dudes ready to kick ass at the drop of an axe. What the fuck does everyone like Wicca for anyway? That shit does not work! It never did! Black magic, white magic, no matter what, you are still being stupid in your dress and your candles and little summon circles and whatever. I think it would be funny if Jedis were a reality, because there would be no big strong handsome Jedis, just a bunch of nerdy, fat, pimply ones, seeing as how the only people who desire to be one with the Force are Star Wars nerds and people who appreciate Starwars. I think that would make Trekkies really sad, that there could be Jedis and yet they could not be Klingon. Also, think about how cool Heavy Metal would be if there were Jedis! OH MY FUCKING GOD, the music would be so awesome, you could call it Jedi Metal or Forcecore or something, and the guitars would be part lightsaber, and they'd be up there rocking it out and doing flips and junk. Oh man, I have to go whipe myself off now..  Ok, i'll put more into this dumb thing later.
