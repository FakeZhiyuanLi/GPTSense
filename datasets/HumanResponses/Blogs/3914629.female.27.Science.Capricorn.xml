      such a day...on call all day, and started out pretty calmly, although soon went a bit pear shaped by mid-morning, with lots of traumatic stuff to cope with. for the patients. although must admit to wanting to run away by about 4pm...managed to be almost an hour and a half late by the time I got to my last few patients. luckily they all understood I'd had to run out to emergencies and had no real choice but to let them sit and wait.  &nbsp; Also difficult stuff with friends at the moment, and wondering if I'm really dealing with anything properly. I'd love to take it all away and sort it out, but I cant and that's that. I must stop feeling that I have such a&nbsp;responsibility to solve the problems of the universe.  &nbsp; I think that my username and profile aren't actually private enough for me to be really honest in this blog. not that there are any comments and I don't suppose anyone actually reads it other than me, but I'm quite identifiable from various bits on my profile. think I'll change it a bit. even so being totally blunt and honest seems weird when you know people may read it and work out who you are. especially if you want to say anything about anything.  &nbsp; the whole point of teenage diaries was that no-one ever would read them and you could say anything. until your mum found it and sneaked a peek...grrr. so, think I'll go and change some stuff. will write another day...under the cover or more anonymity.  &nbsp;

      It's sunday afternoon again! how on earth does that happen? I dont understand how the weekdays are so slow and then Saturday and Sunday race by. I was at work most of yesterday, so that ate up the best part of the day, and&nbsp;then by the time I got home I was too grumpy to do much other than veg out on the sofa. It was our 5th wedding anniversary, so we shared a bottle of champagne, ate a curry and went to bed early-ish. Well, I did, but my beloved ended up coming to bed at 2am after fixing my PC, which I'd managed to bugger up by installing something weird, which erased all my internet settings. I then got a serious case of computer rage and stormed upstairs in the huff. So, romantic evening or what...It's really dangerous knowing only a tiny little bit about computers! It means you can accidentally screw them up without realising it and then it's beyond your limited capabilities to actually do anything about it.  &nbsp; And I HATE not knowing&nbsp;how to do something! At work, I usually know how to do most stuff...it really grates on&nbsp;me that this machine is a mystery.&nbsp; &nbsp; Off to get weighed tonight! I feel a bit nervous...daft, 'cos the only person I'll have let down is myself. Actually felt sick when I tried some rice last night with my curry. I felt bloated and sluggish even after a tablespoon&nbsp;of the stuff.&nbsp; &nbsp; I'm feeling a bit anxious today, for no special reason. I hate free-floating anxiety. It's one of those "there's something I ought to have done, but I haven't" feelings. Cant think what it might be though.&nbsp; I'm off to look at some more interesting peoples stuff, so I'll leave this here.

      so its day 5 of the new diet today, and I've lost 4 pounds I think! although, these are different scales at work, so it might not be as much as that. Someone said today that she thought I looked as though I'd lost weight and I felt irrationally delighted. It's usually just something people say I reckon, especially to fattish people, cos they know how over excited they're likely to get by that comment. still, if I've lost some weight on the scales I probably do look a little different. Hard to tell when you're 4 stone heavier than you ought to be. So I'm on the road to not being a great big fat lump and being able to wear what I want, and feeling good about myself.   Having looked at a few weblogs and being pretty new to all this, I realise that this is trivial in the extreme so far. There are journalists and authors and important people writing important and insightful things, and here I am, a wee fat scottish woman, navel gazing about my weight (if I could see my navel.) Still, it's what's on my mind to the exclusion of most other things at the moment, so that's what I'll write about.   How does food get to be so important to us? I wish I was one of those people who doesn't give a toss one way or the other; one of those freakishly thin women who could happily live on a slice of toast or apple a day. I love everything about food! I love cooking it for people and watching them enjoy something I've made. I love buying a bag of crisps and wolfing it down in front of the tv. I love sitting in the cinema with a big box of sugary popcorn. I love opening a bottle of red wine and working my way through it.   What I dont love is being obese and embarassed about it. I hate the way I look in a vest top or in a smart shirt for work that strains over my chest. I hate feeling out of breath when I climb stairs or catching sight of myself in a shop or car window and thinking "who is that wee fat lump". I hate being embarassed to wear a swimming costume or get in the pool or...the list of things I hate about being fat is as long as my arm.   There are no excuses either; the only reason I am overweight is laziness and gluttony. There probably is some genetic explanation...that's obvious when I look at my mum, who is exactly the same. But basically I eat more than I need to, and I drink more wine than I ought to, and I dont get off my fat arse as much as I should and use up some energy.   So that's where I am today. Slightly proud of a little achievement, slightly anxious that I'll fail this diet thing again, low in confidence that I can shift this weight. Ashamed that out of all the stuff there is to talk about, with people scrabbling around the face of the earth to have enough to eat, I am 48 pounds overweight and that's all I can think about.   Enough navel gazing for today I think. I'll never be as fat as I am today again. Hopefully

      started my 400th diet yesterday. am trying a low carb thing now, tho not Mr Atkin's version. feel not too bad, but bit scared will be yet another failed attempt to get thin. am in the totally obsessed by food mode at the moment! perhaps cutting out caffeine is also a mistake...my poor brain is screaming for caffeine. we'll see how it goes.
