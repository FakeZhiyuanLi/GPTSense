      In one of the shops that we explored this morning, the proprietor apologized for the "upset" in front. We looked out for an accident of some kind, but he referred to the street which was torn up, preparatory to paving with blocks of some Australian wood which was guaranteed to last  twenty  years!  We said that we were perfectly used to that sort of thing as it was always going on in New York. At first he didn't catch the "New" and seemed surprised at what we said. After some talk, he found that we were from America, when he said "Well I thought you didn't speak like Yorkshire". This was at a stationer's and library; and we were shown into a little back parlor and seated when we asked for souvenir postcards. It was almost like a social call, but we finally purchased some and went in search of the P.O.  On the street, a large square two-wheeled cart, in which sat a very stout woman, was being drawn by a tiny donkey, not as high as the dash board, nor half as big as the stolid driver. But he trotted cheerfully along with his load.  The famous-English-complexion mystery is solved. When you come near those beautiful rosy cheecks, you find them to be on the same principle as a red nose - simply a congested condition of the capillaries, due no doubt to the heavy eating and drinking. It looks very well - at a distance - when the proud beauty is youthful, but towards middle life it becomes purple and mottled and apoplectic and all such things. America is safe, yet a while.  When the paper hanger came to the house, he handed my sister a package and asked her if she would please "hot" his tea. The package contained about a small cup of dry tea and some large crystals of raw sugar, and he explained that he would like to have it about the middle of the morning.  As the household teapot is very small, holding only two cups, she hastened to carry up the decoction, saying that she was afraid it would be rather strong, but he assured her that it was "quite right". "Thank you" is the response for everything - rising inflection on the "you".  We were referred to the draper's, the chemist's and the green grocer's, and saw no barber shops - only "Gentleman's Hairdressing Saloons". Fare on the tram cars is a penny.  The ruins of Birkenhead Priory, now partly restored as St. Mary's Church (Anglican), are out toward the river.  Dating from 1150, it is of late Norman architecture, showing the beginnings of Gothic in the slightly pointed arches, springing from a central pillar.  We were shown the crypt under the refectory which was unroofted, and the ground floor of the chapel. Here and there on the moss covered ground, lay fragments of stone carvings. The old fireplace could be traced - no chimney rising from it: there had been a hood and flue to carry off the smoke through the kitchen. One old stone bore an inscription in curious Latin, telling of the burial of a beloved prior in 1473.  The new church was behind the ruins, which are zealousy guarded and very proudly shown by a special keeper.

      We landed at 8:30 and went to the custom inspection office, where the baggage was arranged in heaps, alphabetically, so that one could readily find his own and be ready to open it when the official appeared. The examination is very perfunctory and we were in there less than half an hour.  A ferry brings one to Birkenhead, the residence of many Liverpool business people. Lines of tram cars meet the boats - small affairs (the cars), with seats on top - but very nice to ride in.  It is a comparatively new town and looks not unlike ours, only the buildings are so low, small and all of brick or stone. Most of the dwellings are enclosed by low walls, and a hedge inside.  20 Maple St. is brick with ivy over the front and a brass knocker on the door. In each room is an open grate, and in the kitchen, a range for soft coal. You cook over an open fire in the middle, and the oven on the left is heated by coals pushed under it. On the right is the hob where a kettle or pot may stand and simmer.   The kitchen and scullery floors are of red and white tiles, and the latter has a copper kettle set it masonry, under which a fire is to be built.  Although there is gas in the house, we lighted a candle and set it on the little mantel of our bedroom at bed time, and felt really in England.

      This was a day of days, for it gave us our first glimpse of foreign shores.  It was light very early, entering St. George's Channel, and about four o'clock, the early risers were excitedly walking on the deck and scanning the horizon. Soon it came into view - the southern shores of Ireland, rising in steep cliffs from the water. At first, in the gray morning light, these heather-crowned steeps looked very desolate. For miles, not a house could be seen; only the rugged rocky shore with here and there an old gray square stone tower rising from some headland. These were watch towers, where in the old days a lookout was kept for smugglers who would bring liquors and tobacco from Spain. The lighthouses were a feature of the coast. The tower, surrounding buildings and enclosing wall, were all white, stood out clearly against the rich dark green background. Fastness Light is on a small rock island, off the coast. Gallyhead is on a bold projecting promontory.  As the morning advanced, the sun shone brightly in a sky of deep violet blue and lit up the water, which here has a very clear greenish tint.  And now appeared cultivated fields, looking, at a distance, like squares of different greens, fitted together like patchwork, and joined with dark lines, which were hedges. Dotted here and there were hamlets - a little cluster of low stone buildings, white-washed and ofted thatched; and in their midst, the spire of a dark stone church. Not a tree to be seen, except in two or three places where they had evidently been planted around a homestead.  At ten, we came off Queenstown. It lies in a beautiful bay: at one side of the entrance is a lighthouse and at the other, massive fortifications, reached by an enormously long and broad staircase of stone. The town has the effect, from a distance of a faint reddish haze at the base of the green.  The steamer came to a stop, and the union jack was run up at the stern, the White Star ensign at one masthead and the stars and stripes at the other. Then the tender came up and took off passengers and mail.  As we sailed on up the coast, new and varied beauties appeared. The whole scene was indescribably charming. There on our left the wild, rocky foreign shores, here and there, on the Irish Sea, steamers and battleships and dark brown-sailed fishing boats; the great vessel cutting her way through those matchless waters, in her wake, a flock of seagulls which hung poised over the ship or circled and swooped into the waves, and over and around all, glorious sunshine and sparkling exhilirating air. All the afternoon we sailed, it seemed, in a dream-land. We had our chairs on the deck, close to the rail, and it seemed like a picture that was spread before us. Later we veered to the eastward and were soon out of sight of land.  Early in the evening, dim, cloud-like outlines appeared in the east. It was fitting that the land of King Arthur and the Wizard Merlin should first be seen, veiled by a haze which gave it an air of mystery. And such jagged peaks as those which gradually lifted themselves into view: even more wild and desolate than the Irish coast. As we came nearer, low, settled shores were lying close to the sea; and after two or three hours, Holyhead Isle appeared.  It is one great rock, 700 feet high, fissured and wave beaten, with the usual lighthouse on the southern shore. It seemed more like a picture than solid earth: its grays and browns and the white and red of the lighthouse were so vivid in the sun which was slowly sinking - so slowly, for this day was longer than any we had ever known. All the evening, those pictured shores stretched away on the east, and it was not till nine o'clock that we turned to the west to see the sun set. And there it hung, a great red globe, low in the hazy west. Above it were flecked layers of dark clouds, below it, trailed the black smoke of a steamer and between it and over and around us, floated and circled the graceful birds. As if flattened and dipped below the horizon, the most exquisite tints came in the sky; and for more than an hour we watched the changing colors.  In the east, the half moon was already high, and it silvered the waves and the wings of the gulls.  And so the long twilight lasted till eleven o'clock came and we floated over the bar at the mouth of the Mersey and were soon at anchor in its muddy waters.  On this last evening, the little party which had enjoyed the day together had supper in the saloon. It is the usual English meal of bread, cheese and ale or coffee, and so delightful for the last night.  There were Mr. and Mrs. Jackson, going home to Yorkshire; Dr. and Mrs. Norman, just married and bound as missionaries to Africa; Mrs. McClure; the Rev. de Soyres, an Episcopalian rector from Canada; Mr. Wilson, a Canadian touring; Mr. Normal McDonald, a Scotch actor; my cousin and myself.

      Fifteen hundred miles from land, and yet not isolated - in feeling, at least. We are a world of our own, and there is no feeling of loneliness. Although we are rushing across the ocean at a great speed and with resistless energy, yet we are always in the center of an apparently small circle of water. And this water never looks twice the same: now blue and dancing in white-crested waves, now gray and oily beneath the fog, now smooth and sparkling, but always beautiful and giving a feeling of rest and peacefulness.  On board there is a heterogenous crowd: English going home for visits, missionaries to Africa, Japanese who have been to America for education, Australian and Canadian colonists bound for the mother-country, the ever-present American tourist and the indescribables - people who seem unaccountable, and the like of which one scarcely sees anywhere else. Of all places, a trans-Atlantic liner is the best to see a variety of classes.  A delightful Bohemianism prevails. At every turn one runs upon an interesting bit of conversation, an odd manner or a new type of face. You may join any group, listn or enter into the conversation as you choose.  Here is a beautiful Norwegian woman. She is of the purist Teutonic type - profile like a cameo, complexion of pearl, almost golden hair and eyes of that deep northern blue - she is beautifully gowned in American style; sitting in a corner of the library and telling in broken English and the sweetest voice, of her native country. Two smooth-shaven English tourists are interestedly listening. She is very intelligent and all she says has the charm, not only of interest, but of her own manner.  There, an Englishman who has lived several years in America is asserting that the only way in which Americans may hope to perpetuate their national characteristics and preserve their liberties is to have larger families, and so prevent the foreign element from preponderating.  The wife of this man tells us that the first time she crossed, she was on her way to be married, her intended husband having been over in America some time before. She was from Yorkshire, but educated in London and had been a teacher in a girls' school. Her speech to the casual listener retains only two words that are dialectic: "welly" for very and "gell" for girl.  And such a feast of English dialects and inflections! It needs a trained ear and a quick understanding to catch all their peculiarities, much less to distinguish their origins. The Australian asks if "a good cowt will do ye" when one complains of being cold: some one else tells a small boy to "stawp" some prank - everyone says "cahn't" or "cawn't" - but strangely enough there are few or no "h's" dropped. More than anything else, the inflections differentiate the English and American speech.  There are some Scottish women, with a very pretty tongue, and some Irish - with a brogue and without.  The day begins about five when the deck stewards scrub the deck with much emphasis just outside one's port-hole, and take down the shutter of the same with a bang. Then you look out and see the blue waves racing past, and perhaps pull down the dark shades for another nap. But not long are you allowed to remain in peace: the rising gong sounds about six, and, in order to get around for seven o'clock breakfast, the occupants of a stateroom must begin to make themselves ready, for dressing is done on the installment plan - one at a time emerging from the berth and steadying herself cautiously, fastening hooks and buttons that seem most refractory.  The cooking is English - you leave your native land when you board the steamer. To an American it is appalling to see the average breakfaster surrounded by plates of bacon and eggs, kippered herring, racks of toast, jam, marmalade and tea, and to see him calmly and deliberately laying away generous supplies of all these delicacies. Dinner is at one and is very like ours, except for such dishes as Yorkshire pudding with roast beef, etc. "Ten" at five is another assemblage of delicacies like those of breakfast - "Twice-laid" on the menu puzzled even a hardy Briton. Upon being set before him, it was gravely investigated and pronounced "not mooch".  It was a sort of salmon-mauve compound, browned, like hash, on each side. Then, for the hardened, there is the bread and cheese and coffee - or whatever tipple your fancy - supper at nine. All the time between these serious achievements, you may hear corks popping cheerfully in the smoke room and see fruit baskets marshalled on the deck.  Walking is an important feature of the day's business. The athletic Briton counts his paces and does his mile or so faithfully: the more frivolous walk, or stroll or stop to chat or to look over the deck rail as the fancy pleases. But the air makes exercise a delight. Such air, off miles of sea water - there is nothing like it.  Then to stretch comfortably in a deck chair, well tucked under a rug and to loaf away hours in delicious idleness. It is impossible to carry a single worry across the water.

      The sail to Carnarvon gave us a nearer view of the Northern Welsh coast than the one which we obtained from the Majestic. It is about two hours from Liverpool to Llandudno. The latter place is the fashionable watering place on the northern coast, and lies in a semicircular bay, between Great and Little Orme's Heads. As the St. Tudno came up to the pier, we could see that it was crowded with people, some to meet friends and some merely to watch the landing.  Then on to Beaumaris Bay, past Puffin Island, and near the Anglesea shore. The island is a great bare rock, like Holyhead, but smaller, and takes its name from the multitude of puffins which live on it. They rise like a cloud from the rocks as the steamer comes near, and then settle back with harsh cries. There is the usual lighthouse on the island, but no signs of habitation.  The inner shores of Anglesea are much softer than the wester & clumps of trees appear here and there, and cultivated fields. Beautiful country houses dot the shores - all of stone, and many built in castle style.  The ruins, ivy covered, are seen from the pier. The village is very quaint - white washed stone houses.  The strait continues to narrow till both shores may be seen: on the right, the trees and farms of Anglesea, and on the left the wilder shores of the mainland with the towers of Penrhyn Castle in the distance. Farther back rises the Snowdonia Range, with the bare peaks of Penmaenmawr and Conway. The great wealth of this region lies in the slate quarries; and the Penrhyn estate is particularly rich in it. Bangor is the nearest port, from which quantities are shipped.  A little way past Bangor is the Menai suspension bridge, famed in this region, but nothing when compared with the Brooklyn Bridge. At the Menai Bridge pier, we left the St. Tudno, and took the Ynys Mon, a tiny steamer which plies the narrow. The scenery here is much admired and is pretty, in a simple way, near the shore; tho' on the left, the grand, bare peaks are constantly seen.  The Anglesea Column was erected to the Marquis of Anglesea, who was wounded at Waterloo. It is a magnificent pillar with a statue of the Marquis on the top, and stands on a height of land overlooking the beautiful Anglesea estate and mansion. The house is of gray stone, built on straight lines - no arches, but everything right angles.  Landing at the wharf at Carnarvon, we walked up to the massive gray walls, and entered the gate. Inside, we felt, more than in any other place we had visited, that we were in a foreign city. The street was scarcely wider than the arch of the gateway, and was flanked by narrow old stone houses, very irregular in height and cheerless in appearance.  On through the town, toward the castle, which could be seen from a distance, until finally the street which leads to it was reached. And there it was, towering far above the houses clustered about it, far more magnificent and imposing than I had imagined. It made one realize the power of feudalism. Looking at it and then into the faces of the people on the streets - dull and ignorant, and then thinking what their ancestors must have been, centuries ago, it was not hard to realize how might had ruled in those days.   A further walk through the streets gave us glimpses up narrow lanes, from which outside stairs led to the upper floors - into queer little rooms - of houses, whose second story windows might be reached with the hand; and every where the queer Welsh chatter - every child spoke it, and the grown people seemed to, also, except to strangers.  A quaintly dressed old woman keeps the castle gates, and lives in one of the towers at the entrance. In the courts, grass is growing and a few sheep are pastured. The visitors are left to wander over the building by themselves and so one may enjoy it in his own way. It is well preserved and has been so skilfully restored from time to time that the new can scarcely be detected from the old. In each turret is a well staircase - a perfect spiral around a central post, formed by the end of each step, and completely filling the turret. We climbed to the top of one on the Eagle Tower, and tried to imagine how the scene below must have looked six centuries ago.  The view was beautiful. It was about six o'clock, and the sun, though high, threw a peculiar warm light which gave a reddish instead of a purplish tint to the distant mountains and to the stand bars and waters of the strait.  There was a peculiar form of arch which appeared again and again in the castle. It is like this:   and is unlike the Early Gothic style of the building. The towers and turrets are mainly octagonal - some hexagonal - and the walls are of great thickness - usually containing a narrow passage. A loop hole is about 4 feet wide on the inside, narrowing to a mere slit on the outer wall.  Across the street from the castle we secured the coziest lodgings: a sitting room, in which our meals were served, and a bedroom. The latter had an old mahogany dressing table and wash stand and a bed with a valence of white damask. In the grate, a fire was laid, and we were given a candle at bed-time.  The sitting room had an elaborate fire place with fender and fire irons of highly polished steel; and over it, a cabinet mantel containing very curious ornaments. Another little three-cornered cabinet was likewise decorated. There was an easy chair, a brown leather sofa, and three very small, oddly shaped chairs, entirely of some dark wood and showing traces of some odd enameled decoration.  Castle Square is a large open space on the town side of the castle, under Queen Eleanor's gate. Seven streets open from it, and a fountain plays in the middle. About sunset, there were many groups collected about the fountain: red-coated soldiers from the barracks under the city walls, children in clattering wooden-soled Lancashire clogs, girls in their queer Sunday best, and freshly washed youths bashfully circling round. Everywhere the strange language, and faces of a new type - or rather two: one dark, heavy with rather large features; the other red-haired, small hazel eyes rather close together and often crossed and the fair skin that goes with red hair.  The city walls are narrow, and the semi-circular towers which jut out from them at frequent intervals are now used for a variety of purposes: one is a part of an office building and has large square windows; another forms the outer walls of the barracks; and another is the choir of a church, and has a large oriel window and some attempt at a tower.  The promenade is just outside the walls and along the Seiont River and Menai Strait. Strolling along it and sitting upon the benches were the same kinds of people. The red coats, their tiny capes set jauntily on one side, with their arms about their sweethearts' waists gayly allowed their way through the throng of children, women with fruit baskets on their heads, and grave knickerbockered and monocled tourists.  By rail from Carnarvon to Conway is a picturesque ride, with glimpses of the water on the left, and mountains of the right. The villages, such as the one here pictured, are clusters of white-washed, slate-roofed cottages, set in the luxuriant greens of field and tree. Sometimes roses or ivy climb to the roof. Then, nearer the water, there is always the pier from which is shipped slate from the hill quarries.  There are six tunnels, each about three fourths of a mile in length in this ride of about 40 miles; and through each of them we rushed without a ray of light in the compartment. There were gas jets overhead, but as no guards accompany the trains, excepting one on the rear platform, they remained unlighted.  To a stranger, it is bewildering to pass through unfamiliar stations, and to hear the names only in a distant shout from the platform. A few guards remain on each, and open carriage doors and take tickets as the train stops. If there are too many doors, the passenger must let down the sash in the door, reach out and unfasten it himself. They are never locked unless you wish the compartment to yourself and make it worth while for the guard to secure it to you.

      The postmen here have no idea of geography. They do not know how the U.S. are divided nor where they are.  Olive's maid said: "Isn't King Edward your king too? I thought he was king of the whole world."

      In a pastry shop in Liverpool we looked over a list of beverages and decided to try "lemon squash". The maid brought a glass of what appeared to be unsweetened lemonade, but when we put in a big spoonful of sugar, there was a great fizzing and it boiled up out of the glass, over on the plate, table, floor and incidentally on my skirt. I was torn between the desires to save the squash and my clothing; but the maid condescendingly brough me a large towel. After it was all over, we tried the straws and found this favorite English drink to be a bitter mixture of bottled soda and lemon juice; and when the sugar is put in, the fizzing results. The initiated put it in gradually, stirring with the straws until the right amount of foam is obtained.  French pastry is fearfully and wonderfully made. There are a great number of varieties: mine was first a cup shape of puff paste filled with some kind of cake, then layers of jam, meringue, chocolate, glazing, almonds, etc.; but it is very good.  When you order anything - cheese for instance - you are served with a great piece from which you areto help yourself. Then the waiter comes in, surveys the ravages and makes out your check. I think they must have brought us about a cubic foot of Chesire cheese at Bolland 'R' and in Liverpool, we had a great tray full of pastry from which to choose.  Birkenhead park is beautiful. There are so many varieties of holly: some leaves no larger than    and this variegated kind.     The famed English daisy - the "Wee modest crimson tipped flower" of Burns  the "flower whyte and rede" of Chaucer - is indeed wee: something like this:    It has a stem about an inch long; and in some places the grass is thickly spangled with them. While in bud, they are "crimson-tipped", but when fully opened, the tint is not noticed. A small buttercup with very short stem also grows in the park. I did not see one familiar tree.

      We wore winter suits and wrapped in heavy shawls for the sail on the Dee. It was extremely windy. Many people wore furs.  The Victoria Dining Rooms are on the second floor on the corner of Eastgate and Bridge streets, opposite the Cross, and are reached by a narrow crooked stairway which leads past a tap-room in which a rosy cheeked bar-maid was serving bluff Britons with foaming glasses. A tall old clock stands on the last turn, and then we enter a low square room with a big fireplace in one corner, leather cushioned seats all around the walls, and four tables set for dinner. A bell, like those used by milkmen in the states, stands on each table and a vigorous shake summons a diminutive maid who brings us some excellent roast beef and vegetables. She seems surprised when we ask for bread and butter and disappears for a long time. Finally she returns bearing a plate on which are huge six slices, ready buttered.  Later we entered a sweets shop and encountered a maid with a dialect unlike anything we had heard and communication was difficult. Finally she said pityingly: "Ye dawnt oonderstahnd mooch English, do ye? It's hard for ye at first." We smiled apologetically and finally used the word "candy". At this her face lit up and she said: "Oh ye're Americans: that's what they always ask for. Do they have a language of their own over there?" We assured her that many of them could understand English and she seemed much relieved.  The river Dee is pretty in a peaceful sort of way. It is scarcely more than a brook, a little up from the city. Little tea-houses dot its banks, and it is a favorite afternoon sail - to Eccleston Ferry & Eaton Hall, or shorter trips.  Eccles cakes at Bolland's in the Rows are far famed, so we went there for tea. But only one Eccles cake remained in the shop, and we carefully divided it. It is a round of crisp pastry, in the middle of which is a layer of currants, sugar, spice and other things nice, and we only wished the supply was greater. But we had delicious chocolate, toasted scones, Cheshire cheese and indescribably nice tea cakes.  On the way home, our train stopped opposite another, and in the compartment opposite us, we heard "The Star Spangled Banner" from a merry party of tourists. The smile and stare of surprise and delight with which we greeted the song was answered by "Oh, we're Yankees" - "So are we - Hurrah for the States" - and the train moved on.

      Christ Church (Anglican) at 11 A.M., and we particularly enjoyed the sweetness of the voices in the intoned service. The pronounciation was exactly as with us except the Italian  a  and "ag a inst".   In the afternoon, instead of going to New Brighton as we had expected, we sat around a soft coal fire in the open grate. The weather was cold and stormy.

      After a great search, Olive found some snappers at a confectioners, and a tiny toy pistol and caps at another place. These, with the stars and stripes and a strictly American breakfast, constituted our Independence Day celebration. To use fireworks, one must get a license, over here; such things are sold only for Nov. 5, the Gunpowder Plot anniversary.  In Liverpool in the afternoon we visited the Museum where there was a most interesting collection of Anglo-Saxon relics from graves and sand pits in Kent: many brass buckles, iron sword blades, drinking glasses, ivory and wooden combs, a few silver and gold ornaments, glass beads, etc.  Then to the Walker Art Gallery where I particularly enjoyed a painting. On the road to ___________: A Fine Elaine and a Sampson also.  In St. George's Hall we enjoyed music from the largest orgain in the world.  A ride on the overhead railway gave us a very good view of the Docks, where ocean liners float easily. We tried the second class compartment and found our fellow passengers about what would be seen in a N.Y. elevated. The seats are a little smaller, and there was no crowding nor hurry. The stops are not called but a leisurely wait is made at each.  Then across the Birkenhead ferry, on the top deck which is entirely open and covers the entire boat. They turn the side of the boat to the wharf and let down a plank by which the upper deck passengers may reach steps to the wharf. The Mersey here is not more than half as wide as the Hudson between Hoboken and N.Y. and is much prettier. There is every sort of craft floating about, and the docks and riverside are not so ugly as our port.

      I want to be one of those old hippies who wears mumus because they're comfortable and wears her hair long even though it's gone grey.  Is it weird that I'm looking forward to aging? I mean, I'm not looking forward to aches and pains, and I'm not hoping to rush the process or anything. But it seems like I will feel less pressure to be "pretty" when I'm old.   I know that a lot of women feel it's the opposite: that it's easy to be young and hard to age (and if I worked in Hollywood--where a career can be ruined by the natural aging process--I might agree). But I think it's terribly difficult to be young and not fit cultural standards, physically speaking. People look at you more when you're young. It's when you're supposed to be finding a mate and orchestrating your fairy tale ending. A task that poor self esteem makes quite dicey, I must add.  When you're old, all that stuff is--supposedly--over and done. Decided. There's no pressure.  Maybe I'm just delusional. It's easy to pontificate this way from 24 years old. I might feel differently when I'm 60.

      I hate to diet. I absolutely  abhor  it.  It seems like I am always setting myself up for failure. I set goals--sometimes tiny, sometimes enormous and unrealistic--and when I fall short, I feel guilty.  Guilt and dieting, for me, go hand in hand.  I think I have built up a resentment to the entire concept of dieting  because  of the guilt I feel when I break the regimen.   It's a bit silly really, because I have had self-imposed dietary restrictions for as long as I can remember. I limit my dairy intake (because of lactose intolerance, and also, dairy isn't that good for you!), I don't eat red meat or pork, and I limit my carbohydrate intake (despite constantly craving carbs). This is just something I do, but if I called it a diet, I'd eat half a cow and a tub of ice cream tomorrow, just in spite of myself.  I wonder why?

      Here's the deal: I have never been supermodel material.  I look at women who spend their days on the catwalks and my mind boggles. No amount of proper eating, exercise or metabolism-enhancing pills will ever give me their physique. And being so bombared with adverts and images telling me I'm TOO FAT and I need to LOSE WEIGHT FAST puts me into sensory overload.  I can't be all bad, because I've had boyfriends, and people tell me I'm pretty quite frequently. But I don't feel attractive, and I haven't for as long as I can remember. I have never been, in my estimation, a pretty girl.  But why the fuck am I so hard on myself? Why are we all so hard on ourselves? When did life become a constant obsession with dieting, instead of something to be lived and loved and  enjoyed ? When did Atkins become more important than God?   I recently met a man on the Internet, and he's really wonderful. I'm so enjoying getting to know him that we're slated to meet in person in early Autumn. Already I'm worrying--will I compare to other women he's been with? Will he be disappointed? Mind you I went through all of these worries with my ex boyfriends, and it was all for naught. They still took me to bed (where I work magic, because nothing makes me feel better about myself than pleasing my mate), and in some cases, took me into their hearts.  I decided to start this blog because I'm tired of being holed up in this prison of poor self-image, which in turn just fuels the fire of depression (which seems to come and go cyclically). I've asked some friends to come on board and join the "Strangely Shaped Girl" team to post their thoughts too, so that together we can all start to reform our bodies, minds, and spirits, one post at a time.

      I've been thinking a lot about relationships lately. Specifically, I've been thinking about what I bring to the table, and why I have a hard time selling myself to potential partners.  I've been blessed to have some really meaningful relationships in my short life. And I think they've bene formative, too. I've learned a lot about how I behave in a partnership with another human being. All in all, I think I make a pretty good S/O.  I am kind and caring. I am compassionate. I am generous. I am passionate. I am faithful. I am honest. I am supportive. I'm a very good lover (and honestly, I probably wouldn't be if I were catwalk material and all I had to bring to the bed were my looks). I'm attentive. I listen well. I give good feedback. I love to experiment. I am adventurous when able so to be. I am open-minded. I am willing to compromise. I appreciate little things. I like to rise to a challenge.  So if I bring all of those qualities (and more) with me to a relationship, a sort of personality dowry, why has it always been so hard for me to be confident about seeking and securing a partner? I read through personals adverts and a lot of men are looking for the sort of things I have to offer.   I am getting better, though. A little bit every day. I can't take all the credit for my development, though. I have friends who do a great job at boosting my ego!

       A Palm Beach Post writer, making the point that America's obesity problem is not limited to humans, reported from the Boca Greens Animal Hospital (Boca Raton, Fla.) in June that "Pumpkin," a 12-pound Chihuahua, was up and moving well after her recent liposuction surgery. However, the 12 ounces of fat she lost still left her among South Florida's overweight pets, said to be two-thirds of their population. As Pumpkin's owner was reminded, surgery is not to be a substitute for sensible exercise and a modest number of treats. [Palm Beach Post, 6-22-04]   urlLink Click Here for More   What the heck? Honestly, it's not bad enough they're doing liposuction in the stupidest places on people now, but dogs? DOGS?

      Self-esteem, for me, seems to come and go. Almost as cyclically as depression (which, mercifully, I haven't suffered from in quite some time).  Sometimes my self-confidence shifts multiple times in a day. It depends what I'm doing, who I'm with...if I am working on something and accomplishing a lot, I feel very self-confident and proud. Somehow that all spills over to my body image and I feel better about myself. Probably more realistically about myself--because I am my own worst critic.  If I am with someone romantically I can easily feel good about myself, if not great about myself. Love is quite a tonic. There was a bit on  Xena  earlier on in the show's life, wherein Xena tells Gabrielle (paraphrase) that she can only believe in herself when someone else believes in her, first. Written out like this it sounds rather sad, but I can relate to that. Having someone fancy me makes me feel like maybe I'm decent human being material after all.

      Many people tell me that one symptom of depression is a lack of libido. For it, it's always been the exact opposite. When I'm very depressed, I am hypersexual, because giving another person pleasure makes me feel good about myself. I get a sort of high from it, not unlike being buzzed on drugs or alcohol.  As a general matter of course I'm a sexual/sensual being. I love sex and I love making a man feel good. Even when I'm not depressed, nothing makes me feel sexier than to watch a man's face when I'm doing something naughty to him.   But sex, to me, is only good when it's with someone I care about. I can't derive the same boost of self-confidence from attempting to please someone I know nothing about. It just feels hollow and lacking in any substance.  When I am not depressed, sex becomes almost a holy act, for me. I can escape into a "sexual trance" where the only thing that matters is what I'm doing and what's being done to me, focusing entirely on the union of my lover's body with mine. Being in that moment, sharing something so personal...it really is the stuff of dreams.  I haven't been in a deep depression in a long time, and I am making so many positive changes in my life, I don't think I'll be sliding down that slope again anytime soon. Hopefully, if I ever do, I'll be in a relationship with someone who can recognise the depressive tendencies in me and help me to nip it in the bud (either by himself or by encouraging me to seek therapy) before it gets out of hand.  Meanwhile, as I continue to make positive changes and sound steps forward, I am finding my self-confidence creeping towards a better place. The support of loved ones helps immeasurably, but at the end of the day, I've had to be responsible for my own happiness--or misery--and now that I am starting to attain some joy, I'm working even harder at doing what must be done to hold on to it.

         Here is a picture of me at my thinnest. I was 15, 4'11", and 115#. You really can't see it in that picture, but that sweater was literally just hanging off of me in bags, as were my jeans. This is what I'm  supposed  to look like according to all of those wonderful-happy charts. Gag me with a spoon. (can you see the circles under my eyes?)

      So I was tooling around on MSNBC.com's Health news section the other day and came across this little bit of news:  ""Anyone with a body mass index (a ratio between your height and weight) of 25 or above - that’s someone, for example, who is 5-foot-4 and 145 pounds - is considered overweight, according to the National Institutes of Health. Anyone with a body mass index of 30 or above - such as someone who is 5-foot-6 and 186 pounds - is considered obese.""  Isn't that happy news??  Honestly, I sat here and cried. It made me think of me waaaaay back when I was a teenager (20 years ago). An anorexic teenager. I was anorexic because I never felt like I was good enough. I was always too fat, too short, too stupid, too something, too anything, too nothing.  I feel bad enough about weighing 220# as it is, although I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm that heavy - people look at me and can't believe I'm that heavy; I must "carry it well" or something. But then I read articles like the one I quoted,and I end up feeling completely devestated. According to all the so-called "health charts" someone my height is supposed to way somewhere in the vacinity of 110-120#. At the height of my anorexia years, I weighed 115#. I looked awful. I looked like I had one foot in the grave. And I was *not* healthy. My freshman year of college, my swim teacher/coach did that body fat thing they do with callipers, and I came up with *negative* body fat; there wasn't anything on me to pinch!  Reading this made me think of Dina's post about self-image. The American woman is bombarded almost constantly with images and sound-bites about diet and appearance, or at least it seems that way. Ultra-thin women on magazine covers, in advertisements. Advertisements for weightloss supplements and diets, 99% of which never work.  I honestly think that the biggest reason I've had trouble losing weight, aside from not getting more exercise, is that somewhere in the back of my head, I'm terrified of becoming anorexic again. I admitted that to myself a couple of years ago and erroneously thought, "HA! I admitted it, now maybe I can lose weight!" Nope. I've gained 15# since then. And lost it. And gained it back. And lost it. And ... well, you see ... :sigh: Too, I've heard quite often since Tayler was born 13 years ago that women who have c-sections have a hell of a time losing weight, especially when they're given a vertical cut like I was. Maybe I've stuck that into the back of my head and my subconscious hangs on to that for some reason.  I have no idea.  I do know that at one point I lost 75#. I'm not sure how. I do know, though, that 40# of it came right back.  I don't know what it is. I don't overeat; in fact, if anything, I don't eat as much as I should. I eat an apple with every meal. I drink almost two gallons of water every day. I don't drink soda anymore. I pay attention to what snackfoods I eat - I don't eat very many of those anymore, and I make sure I don't eat more than the given "serving size" listed on the nutrition panel (sometimes I don't even eat that much). I don't eat a lot of candy, but what candy I do eat is the new kinds which are sweetened with Splenda. I've cut my caffeine consumption down by 95% - something I thought I'd never do nor ever be able to do. I stopped smoking this time last year; I don't even crave cigarettes. I do Yoga every day, and I bellydance like a maniac once a week. I'm supposed to take a walk every morning, but I refuse to do so during the summer while it's 90* out; with the climate where I live, that's a good way to kill yourself, and I *did* give up being suicidal a long time ago. :sigh:  At this point, I honestly don't know what I'm doing right and what I'm doing wrong. I had a long talk with both of my doctors - once in April and once in June - and they both agree that I *look* good, that losing weight shouldn't be my focus, that being healthy should be. Honestly, right now, my only huge concerns are my blood pressure and my on-going, continuing problems with panic disorder; and truly, everybody seems to agree that my blood pressure problems are largely due to stress issues. (which sets off my anxiety problems ....)  Anyway. I'm glad this blog is here just for this, and that we're here to help and support each other. That means a lot.

      In 3 weeks I'll be leaving for Paris. Tanning, primping & preening, getting myself into some sort of shape (whatever shape it may be, remains to be seen). Three weeks! Cannot possibly be coming that quickly...can it?  I can't help but think back to the AbFab season 4 episode where Edina decides to go on a crash diet to lose weight quickly. (Though that's hardly what I've been doing for the past few months, there's very little "crash" about it...) Quote: "In three weeks I want to be on the cusp of organ failure."  Good old Eddie.

      The "BodyFlex" exercise routine marketers just plain got greedy. And it's a shame, too, because they have a product that I think genuinely works.  When I bought the BodyFlex videos & isometrics bar a long while ago, they weren't making any outrageous claims. They were simply telling the facts: increased oxygen into your body is good! Add resistance for muscle building and you'll have a sure-fire way to fight flab. I had been practicing pranayama for some time, and it seemed like a natural thing to combine both structured breathing and physical exercise. Plus, isometrics just feels  soooooooooo good . (As does deep breathing!)  I was immediately thrilled with the BodyFlex program and loved the isometric "gym bar". It's a little wonder. And I liked the sensbility of it all--no hype, no pressure, just a lot of positive reinforcement and good vibes. Greer Childers, the spokeswoman, has a very gentle way about her. Her little words of encouragement are quite nice, despite the fact that she looks  exactly  like Barbie, right down to the unnatural proportions. She's still huffing and puffing away whilst doing the exercises with you and that's kinda neat.  Plus, you do the entire routine sitting in a chair, but at the end your heart is pumping, you're feeling the burn, and you're definitely aerobic--no doubts about it. It's cardio in its own oxygenated way.   Then the marketers decided to try the tactic of "lose 7-14 inches in 7 days without dieting", which is ludicrous. Of course, the FTC sued. I don't think the BodyFlex program is still being produced, which is a pity. If they hadn't tried the gimmick, they'd still be selling the product--and at not an inconsiderable profit (but people would be feeling good about it instead of feeling cheated).  FWIW, I did not lose 7-14 inches in 7 days, but I did lose a combined total of 25 inches (from all measured points) in the first month, just doing BodyFlex by itself. I still do the routine and still like it very much. It, alone, is not enough to cause substantial weight loss, despite my initial dramatic results (they were not sustainable). It takes proper nutrition & diet, lots of water, and I find that if I do yoga after the BodyFlex routine the results are much more permanent. It's always a combination of things.  Nowadays it's hard to weed out the genuine treasures from the hyped-up junk. Every company seems to be trying to one-up the competition with increasingly incredulous claims. The FTC must have several full-time employees doing nothing but sueing fitness companies. But I consider "BodyFlex" to be a gem. YMMV, of course, because exercise is nothing if not utterly subjective!  I do not think I would have purchased "BodyFlex" had the claim of 7-14 inches in the first week been front and centre when I bought it. I don't recall that phrase being bandied about on the web site or infomercial. I wonder when the parent company decided to jump on the hype bandwagon? At any rate, there is no magic bullet for weight loss, and every time we try a gimmick & fail, we just run the risk of feeling worse about ourselves ("why does this work for them, but not for me?").   I try to steer clear of any product that raises the "too good to be true" red flags. But if you like breathing exercises and you like stretching & resistance training, look for a BodyFlex kit on eBay. You'll want the instructional videos and the "gym bar" (sometimes referred to as "BodyFlex Plus"). Just don't expect to lose 7-14 inches in 7 days--I'm not sure that's possible unless you're dead!
