						   Today marks the start of a new school term, and the end of the June holidays this year. It has been a fun yet boring holiday, with much free time for me, but only me, so boring.. I am Only Lonely.   Finally got back to playing street soccer, but as a goalkeeper. I didnt like the extremely bouncy ball, and as i had only my squash shoes on, i didnt want to play in a outfield position. Made several saves, one which i was pretty proud of. Then finally, the ball's bounciness got to me. As i stretched my leg out to block a shot, the ball bounced over my leg... Oh well.. Off to squash.  Czech won, with Baros on a rampage. He is as he says, in Euro Dreamland. But no matter, he wont last the whole long competition, with Portugal facing them in the finals or Greece. Portugal will still remain victors.  PS: The pizza is still in the fridge. I think i should throw it away soon...

						   Yesterday was a fine day... with setbacks and victories(dunno any better word).   Firstly, Shu Ying spoilt the computer, AGAIN.... As usual, WenJun reformatted the com, deleting the whole of C Drive, which had my Diablo II saved game!!! I had just gotten my Iron golem! And my Civilization III!!! I just discovered OIL!!!  Secondly, the first victory is that WenJun installed WIndows Professional, as i had lent the Windows XP cd to Chee Hong... And now we also have Office 2003.  Thirdly, as i have predicted, Owen will score, because i am Owen. And Portugal will win Euro 2004, noone can stop them. Owen did well, but if i were there with Owen, we would have won it.  That's all i'll write today.  Chee Hong, bring my cd on Sunday! Zhi Yang bring my Diablo II Cd on Sunday!

						   Wah.. today i woke up around 9am, just to hear the phone ringing irritatibly... What a nuisance, ringing so early in the morning. I didnt bother to pick it up, as i thought somebody was at home, and awake. Apparently, noone was... they were either at work or stilll sleeping.   I couldnt care less... too early for me to care. I just ignored it. Then as i was about to drift back into Dreamland, the morning call arrived again. What a bother!  This time, i waited for about 5 secs, then i slowly pulled my unwilling body up, and rushed to pick up the phone. Just as i picked it up, i could see Shu Ying opening her door and staring at me. And the person who called had put down the phone, leaving me with a tooooooooooooooooooooooot sound buzzing in my ear.  Just as i went down and started surfing the net, my mother called to say that she was coming to pick us up, to follow my father,mother and bro to Evan Lim & Co. to collect some drawings, visit my elder sister who just returned from Hong Kong, and went for breakfast, which was more like lunch. Then, finally, home sweet home....  didnt do my physics in the end.... didnt know how to do.... Oh bother... either copy or ask my SMART cousins.   Let's hope they come tomorrow, cause i have to ask them a lot on hw, and finish the potato chips, and i rented Master And Commander. Also, my mother must give them the biscuits from Hong Kong.   Cya...

						   Today i just signed up with bravenet's affiliate program, which promises to pay me 1 dollar for every person who signs up with them through my referral. I have attached the link at the bottom of my blog, does who want a webcounter pls click at the bottom. THX  I think they're lying, but its a bet!   Whilst doing my English summary with my bro's com, i found out that he had a lot of stored music in there. HAHAHHAA! Using my CD-RW, i took 10 songs. They're pretty nice, they include California by Phantom Planet( THe OC theme song ) and Band of Brothers theme song.   Today got a lot of shows to watch! Titan AE( watch b4 but its damn cool) also got S-League Soccer, today is Alberix vs Woodlands, qutie tough match. Then got Robocop: Meltdown.   Shu Xia, Shu Ling, u all can help me check if Sunday got mahjong anot? Cause if got then i tomorrow go rent some shows to watch. That day i went, wah got a lot i want, but i dunno about u guys.

						   More and more ppl have started bloggig... I suppose i can say that Shu Xia introduced us to the term blogging, and now, a lot of ppl around me have blogs. I have one, Shu Ling has many, Shu Ying has one, and even Chee Weng has one. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT???  I guess blogspot will be very happy with the sudden jump in ppl blogging. But now i have no idea which blog i should post my messages in. Should i post in Shu Xia's tag board, my tag board or my own post?  I have been regularly posting new entries into my blog, but whether i can continue when school reopens remains to be seen. The hectic school life may just interrupt my blogging career.   My Mummy just bought tons of Breadtalk bread back, feeling hungry again, will be eating soon. The potato chips bought on Sunday may be in my stomach while i watch the England vs Switzerland match. It depends. Food Food Food.   This entry is kindda boring. Dont u think?

						   Well... it hasnt been very smooth so far, and i have only semi-partially completed the CHemistry worksheets handed out. Almost 3/4 of it is blank, the reason is because i dunno how to do... Hopefully when my cousins come over, they can help out! ;)   Started on English today, decided to leave all the summaries for later and do the compre qns only, but i was just too lazy to complete all the qns. Left 1 worksheet i haven started on it yet. Its just beside me now... i think i'll do it tonight or tomorrow then.   Maths will be left for school reopen when i shall CO-OPERATE with my dear friends and do it together. Its an online quiz which ends on 30 June, thus we have time to do it together in the library.  Chinese will be done soon too, anything i dunno i'm sure Shu Xia can help me out. I still remember u got DISTINCTION for Chinese right? Chicken Wing was so like "'wah kao' u lie to me, say u sure fail one... then in the end get Distinction". LOL So humble ar some pppl.   Well thats all in the past, and the future awaits. Will be older and hopefully more mature next week, when my birthday arrives. Yong Sheng supposed to accompany me go Liverpool FC Fan Club to buy jerseys and football, but not confirmed, maybe any of u out there also can help me do this favour and bring me there. I've been wanting to go for 4 years.   Thx, and eternal gratitude... Love ya

						   Today, i finally got to meet Shu Xia's DEAR... but only his picture on the net. Frankly speaking, he wasnt wat i expected... Cant help it. I expected a more macho and handsome looking guy, someone to match up to the PRETTY cousin of mine (Happy?). His specs made him look nerdy and old, exactly like those nerds in the TV Dramas.  He is exactly like those nerds, aiming for high marks, extremely sentimental and sensitive to their emotions, then when they get heartbroken, they lose their minds and cannot accept it, then they decide to die together... :(   Oh well, bad points aside, he seems like a pretty nice chap.  Will be watching the Euro 2004 matcheS today, especially the Holland vs Germany. I'm hoping that Germany will win!   Well.. then 2 Face to Screen experiences today... how about that?

						   Watched the 2.30AM France vs England Euro 2004 match today, wasnt as spectacular as i was expecting, but it was good enough! I had to struggle with the temptation to sleep to catch the 'live' action, but it was worth it. England were struggling throughout the match but they managed to pull ahead through Frank Lampard's header.  The second half saw several yellow cards and penalties. Silvestre should have been red carded, and David James too. Beckham's missed penalty inadvertly cost England 2 points, but i felt Barthez did great, and i felt it was logical for him to guess the England Captain would shoot to the left. He takes his free kicks side-footed, thus most of his kicks go to the left.   The funny part of the game is that Barthez blocked a shot with his nose!!! Can you believe it? He fumbled with a normal shot and it bounced off the ground and hit his nose!   It wasn't until injury time that France made the surprise comeback. A freekick just outside the penalty box taken by Zidane gave France their equalizer. 1 minute later, Henry was set free by Gerrard's miscued backpass but was brought down by David James. YELLOW CARD? I felt it should've been a red. Zidane calmly put France 2-1 up.  Overall, i felt that France dominated the game, while England's defence held strong. Won't be catching the match tonight though, as it aint a great match, and i need to sleep tonight!

						   Early in the day, my cousins came over again... Had fun playing basketball but we lost to some younger boys... Cant believe it! We LOST! We were leading by about 5 points when they started catching up. Soon it was 19-18 to our favour, and yet we still lost in the end.  The girls were buzzing around taking photos with Shu Xia's digital cam, and they kept telling me to end the game quickly, just so that they can go get their ice-cream.  Later that day, i went online and checked for 'Live' coverage of the Euro 2004 on TV3 and to my surprise, they were broadcasting it live on TV3! So for those without Cable, tune in to TV3 at 2.45am and you'll be in for a treat! With the likes of Zidane, Henry, Viera, Gerrard, Owen, Lampard and more, prepare for a match with lots of action!

						   Today played Gunbound with E Face and Lard Ass... got to see Lard Ass in action, and he seems slightly lousier than E Face. I was the main lagger as my connection was not at its best. It has been like this for the past week... when will it get back to its usual peak performance is still a mystery.  Had several wins, but i lagged out of 1 game, and lost a few, i think only 1 game or 2. They kept choosing Meta Mine when i hated it, and Lard Ass wanted to kick me out because i lagged too badly. I feel that i have improved vastly, but i will not rest on my laurels.  Aiming for Metal Axe by Tuesday. But next week marks the start of the HOMEWORK RUSH.   Will work on my blog if i have the time. Cya... hoping to find a UNIQUE tag board.

						    This post is meant to be a secret, and it should not be talked about at all.      Today is the day of the Plain English Speaking Competition. Iw as one of the supporters, and i had to be at the competiotion, giving my support. Edwin was sitting beside me, and we were cut off from the rest of the Chinese High boys. But no matter. wats the difference, i thought.      Then the rest of the supporters starting pouring in. One by school by another came in, taking their seats. Nanyang was behind us, NanHua was in front.      I noticed this girl sitting in front of me, quite pretty.(Yes this is what the post is about) She had her hair tied back, and i saw blue earrings on her ear lobes. Very pretty.       Wished i could have her contact... wished for a phone to take her pohoto. Oh well... too bad... Next stop, getting a phone to do waht i wanan do!!!

						   Went to watch the movie with Chee Hong, Zhi Yang, Yong Sheng, Job and Wei Yi today. Quite a fun day, but very confusing. Had to decide on what time the movie we should watch, as Chee Hong and Zhi Yang were still in Choa Chu Kang.  Called Chee Hong about 5 times and still no reply. Then finally, they are on&nbsp;their way. Movie was great. The cinema was a bit too cold, but i had a great show, or maybe 2 great shows.  Cause only 3 seats away, were a couple who were VERy intimate. Then i was supposed to sit beside them, but i didnt want to play Gooseberry, so i moved urthur away. Wei Yi and Job went to sit on the VIP Sofas!  Then we went to kick ball. Walked so far, stupid Yong Sheng very dumb. I know one street soccer court very near to West Mall, yet he went to one so far away....  Haiz... and even the game also go agaisnt me! Shot so many times, and their keeper damn zai! I hit the post twice already!!!! WHY NEVER SCORE?&nbsp;  Then my parents cannot find their way to us... So angry.. i so scared... but my composure saved me from a lot of scolding.  TATA

						   Today Miss Foo came into class, and sat down, laid her specs on the table, and put on a very grim face. She was waiting for everyone to settle down, yet everyone knew it was a different day, as she was not her usual self.  Then the surprise came. She said she didnt want to have lesson today. Instead, she wanted to talk about Life.   Whyfore do we live?    That was the question posed to us. Then she started asking ppl, What is the purpose in life.   Funny answers popped out, such as To have sex. To ensure the continuation of our species.  But i knew what i would say, my purpose in life is to find out wat my purpose in life is.  Miss Foo's purpose in life was to find the meaning in life. Confusing?   Anyway, this simple pep talk spooked us all out. Her usual scoldings were all redundant. This was the real surprise. A sudden talk on Life. A sympton of suicidal, as taught by a lecture the school had organised.   Now i wonder..... where is she.... Earth or Heaven.

						   Stupid Mr CHong. Go and confiscate my soccer ball.  THe ball was in my plastic bag, and Wei Xiong stepped on it, it rolled out. He put back in, and we all went to the back of the class to sign in the Account Logbook. Then i was in the crowd when i saw the Dumb DUMb Chong go to my seat, pick up my "Robinsons The Sale Worth Waiting For" plastic bag and put it on the teacher's chair.   That dumb dumb. I found out that he had seen someone playing with the ball, apparantly it must have been the rolling of the ball out of the plastic bag, and perhaps a couple of kicks when ppl walk past.   THAT DUM DUM. Then he like that say confiscate for 1 month. WHAT THE CRAP. Today supposed to play soccer with Jun Hao lor, who just came back from Australia. He will be going back tomorrow. So of course must treasure this chance. Too bad no Nougat.  NVM. Luckily, Zhi Ming the smart guy helped me get the ball back.   Conclusion: CHONG IS A DUMB DUMB.

						   Yup. Today's a day full of events that hover around Jun Jie.   Firstly, the first bit of action came when it was nearing the end of recess. Yong Sheng and me were begging Job to play Sexy Poker, as it was a fun game, not for any other reason. Then as i walked away, Jun Jie came over, and for no reason, grabbed Job's 16-year old brother. Poor thing.  Everyone had the same reaction. "Gay!" Job was the one who was shocked the most. Jun Jie has been renowned to look like Jamie Yeo, but we didnt think he would do a thing like that.  Next, the following event is rather minor. It happened during Chinese lesson. Kee was babbling and niaoing ppl as usual, and she stopped, looking at Jun Jie and Wei Xiong, she said in chinese, " You two, what are u guys doing? The two of you stop helping each other pluck your hand hair off. GAY ar?" She actually said that!  The final event was the most interesting of all, i was the one who spotted it.  It happened like this. We were reading a chinese article, when i heard water splashing onto the floor, as though someone was urinating. I turned around, looking for the source of the sound, and i saw a puddle of water under Jun Jie's table. Instinctively, i thought Jun Jie had some problem and could not hold back his urine.   Then i looked at his table, and i saw a sight that was very unique, practically the only time i would see this.    WATER WAS FLOWING LIKE A WATERFALL. The table was dripping water like mad. I saw that his waterbottle was on the table in the small ditch, and the ditch was overflowing with water. I quickly alerted Jun Jie and he stopped the leaking of water from his bottle.  Woah. what a sight. The ditch full of water, the floor with a puddle of water, and his worksheets were wet. God knows how he managed to miss the water filling up on his table.    Ending here... PS: I violently objected to Mr Hon's proposal of buying the Clock Model for 85 dollars. he has gone mad!

						   YES! THE MEETING HAS BEEN CANCELLED! Hip hip Hurray!  Finally, i can relax a little now! Now just have to handle MRP. I found websites with quite a bit of info liao. Just need to have the heart to do it.  Oh yar. played soccer today. Scored 7 goals. My previous record was 14 in one day.  When can i break it again?

						   Wah.. so zai, i've been called up to meet with my dear principal, Mr Hon Chiew Weng.  Reason is simple... I failed my 2nd submission for MRP(Major Research Paper). Since my first submission was a 3.25/10, i guess that means i failed it completely. The only for me to pass my Humanities now is to score well for my Contextual Procedural Knowledge( 3rd Submission).  WEll, the meeting is next Wednesday, and luckily it aint only me. Everybody in the school who failed must go meet him, which inculdes about 8 ppl from my class. But one thing is for certain... Everyone under my mentor in my class all failed as well.  I dun think its my fault that i failed. I followed what she told me to do, but she still failed me. What am i supposed to do? Now my MRP fail, that means my Humanities also fail. And for me to go to Sec 4, i need MSG of below 4. Then now i got at least a D7, maybe if lucky C6. What to do?    TELL ME!!! ANyone Out THeRe?

						   Today Shu Ying was doing a compo, on My Idol. As usual, her puny brain could not think of anything Idols, and had to seek my help. She asked wat i would have written if i were given that.  Firstly, i gave the suggestion of writing about myself. I am my own Idol. I am unique. I have to go through everything personally, and i can only give comfort to myself by telling myself that what i have done is for my own good.  Next, i came up with Robin Hood. who else can be an idol than the guy who robs the rich and gives to the poor? I feel that he is a great guy who fights for the good.  In the end, Shu Ying chose to make her Idol, her very own brothers. WHich includes me and WenJun.   Dun wan type liao, need do my IH ws. Due tomorrow. Sianz........    OH YAR! I just registered my I/C today!

						   Well... the imposter posing as Slayer is 99% E Face, and he is doing it just to get revenge. ANyway, Slayer already knows wat E stands for and wants me to call u Steamer. Maybe i will.   Today no mahjong, no bball, no soccer, no nth. So sianz. Another day for me to think of how much hw i have that is uncompleted. When should i start? Dunno. Dun even feel like doing the IH Ace anymore.   My father went to bet on Euro 2004 Finals. I told him to buy Portugal, but he dunno English, so in the end bought Greece. Why??? I support Portugal since the start, and he go and buy their competitors. Never mind. If he wins, he will get 197 dollars-50= 147dollars in profit. Compared with the 90 dollars -50 dollars profit, its a better bet.   Sleep from 10-2, and then OLE OLE OLE OLE... OLE... OLE...   I rented Torque for my dear cousins. Cheaper By The Dozen and School Of Rock still rented out. Maybe i'll watch it later.   Buzz me if u want me to keep it for u. I have to burn it on my cd if u want.

						   Well Well Well... Mr E refers to my dear friend, Lim Yong Sheng. Who is also knows as E Face, for his everglowing red face. Dunnot ask me for what E stands for as it is not good to say it.  He, so smartly, brought my mini cd home, as i had asked him to help me burn Gunbound and Kazaa Lite, and so smartly listened to the songs in it, and without bothering to erase the files, started some crap burning. He was so smart to burn when he didnt even erase. So Smart.  Then, he took his own initiative to use one of his own CDs, and so smartly and supposedly burnt the installation files into it. The next day, he handed both disks over to me. Today, after i just took a look at what he had SUPPOSEDLY burnt in them, i saw to my dismay, my cd practically untouched, and his cd used, as it indicated no more free space, and no files in it. SO SMART...  Just looking at him will make my life shorter....

						   Today is the aftermath of 2 disasters....  Firstly, my uncle has been hospitalised... Chee Hong's father. He is having some heart problems and is undergoing a checkup. I went to visit him today and boy, he was so full of energy and optimism.  THe first thing he said to me was, " Want to play game?" and he lifted up his vital stats controller to me. That was damn funny. He's a funny guy.. and good guy. Good ppl dun die that easily. He wont be in hospital for long i hope. He better get well soon, or else my father got no 'car'... cannot play mahjong.  Next is the second disaster. The departure of  Michael Owen, me.   Sad thing to happen. He should have waited for me. just 7 more years and i can take over the reigns and reign over the soccer world. He's off to Real Madrid, and now my favourite club is slowly changing.. once Diouf and Hyypia leave, I guess i will have 2 favourite clubs.    My jersey number is likely to change too. No more 24(Agu Casmir) for me. My new favourite would be watever Owen takes. Hopefully its 24, its not taken yet in Madrid.   I am Owen.Owen is me. WE ARE ONE

						   I have been robbed. I have been robbed of 140 items. I have been robbed by my FEMALE cousin.  She has also cheated her brother of quite a sum of money, which she spent to buy a iPod Mini(U call that pink?). And it was THAT iPod Mini that now holds my precious robbed items.  My 140 songs... all robbed from my dear computer. Years of effort, all snatched away by one puny obsolete noise producer.  Ai ya... cut the crap. Anyway, she downloaded 140 songs from my computer into her iPod. Nothing is free in this world.  Wonder what she can give me in return.   Offered her an option of paying 2 dollars per song;rejected Offered her an option of paying 140 dollars in total;rejected  I have another option for u.    BE MY SLAVE!!!!

						   I feel sleepy. In fact, i have been feeling sleepy for a few weeks already. Dunno why. Worst of all, i have been having diarraheo(dunno how to spell) lor. Sianz. First time since P4 that i went to toilet to do big business during lesson time.  Then during the whole day, i felt so sleepy. Miss Foo's lessons were boring. Chinese was pure boredom, keep going through chinese compre, so sianz!  PE WAS THE BEST! Didnt score, but managed to improve a bit on ball control. Finally executed a turn that most good players can do. My first try and first success. Still didnt like the cross from An Xuan, as it hit my face. i didnt know whether to head or use chest. but using the chest was a better option, still, the ball went to the wrong part of the body.  Shu Xia is sick. dunno wat illness. Fever? Flu? Watever.. get well soon. U dun come my house i cannot test the ringtones leh. My VCD burning software expired. cannot find serial no. anywhere. wat to do?   Soccer, ANYONE?
