      Why is it that friends are receiving so many GMail invites that they don't know what to do with them, and I cannot seem to get even one to offer to my wife??? Some people sign up, and have three invites to offer by the next day. I activly use and test my account, but nothing... no invites to offer. Aurgh...

      Well, I'm on my way to work this morning and find that the Mass Pike, the only main highway to my mindless daily interuption is closed due to a severe fatal accident involving 2 tractor trailers. Those drivers are having a much worse day than me, so no complaints... I took back roads which add an hour to my commute. I'm sitting in my Jeep, waiting to turn left once oncoming traffic is clear, and some bug behind me honks her piece of shit compact station wagon horn at me. I felt an eye twitch and I had to use all of my strength to not get out and punch huge dents into her hood. Can't wait for this Stress Management class.  I finally get to work to see that everyone else in the office is out, stuck on the highway. What does this mean? All workload gets forwarded to my friggen phone.  I'm sitting at my desk taking other peoples calls and receive an email letting me know that my much needed Stress Management class has been postponed until next week.  I now have to wait another week for this class which I know isn't gonna help anyway. I picture being half way through the class and having the speaker hit a hidden button under his/her desk, which calls the men in whites jackets with nets to come storming in and grabbng me.... We'll see. Anything which keeps me away from my desk can't be half bad, even if it means being completely drugged up and thrown into a room for 25 years.

      Well, here I sit at my desk... Monday Morning.  Instead of working, I continue with my quest for a GMail invite. I've been looking for an invite for some time now, and I have yet to find anyone with an Invite to offer. I've been sending out Orkut invites like crazy, but nobody has GMail invites to send back in return.... Aurgh.  In the meantime, I watch my job slowly wither away as they train my replacements out in India. Whatever... I hope they learn to hate my job as much as I have. I hate my job which comes along with a pretty nice salary and great options. They'll have to do my job for a lousy $3.00 equivilent... Serves them right.  My cohorts here at work say that I need anger management... I signed up for a Stress Management class here at work sometime around the end of the week. Can't wait to see how that goes. I'll be lucky if I get through the day without screaming at the teacher like George did in Sienfeld. We'll see... If it goes well, maybe I'll be able to drive to work without driving some jerk of the road.  Anyway... enough bitter banter for now, See ya.
