      In September of 2001, I married a diver. Of course, at the time, he was still a student. We had no concept of the life he had signed up for. A pleasurable scuba dive in clear waters hardly compares to the rigors of the riggers (I have been dying to use that one). Kris had not worn a dive hat. He had not welded under water, nor had he ever dove deep enough to require breathing anything other than the air we breathe on land. He was what the diving community would call a guppy. What I have come to learn is that being a diver is not really about your job title. Being a diver is who you are.  It became obvious at an early age that Kris possessed the unique (read: insane) qualities inherent in all divers. When Kris was a child, he used to hold his breath in the bathtub. "Surely this is not an unusual behavior", you might say (if you talked like that). The difference is that Kris would not come up for air until he reached that peak moment when his brain kicked out the endorphins one receives just before he or she   drowns  . More than once, his mother entered the bathroom in a panic at the sight of her son lying under the water only inches from death.  And this is the man I married.  Divers are a fascinating breed. They live with true passion and conviction. I think it comes with the knowledge that they have one of the most dangerous jobs in the world. They actually rank second in the "Two Bricks Shy Of A Load" competition. Ranked number one, in case you are curious, is crab fishing in Alaska. Apparently the crabs are not too eager to be eaten. At any rate, divers stare death in the face every time they go out on a job, and they live their lives accordingly.  Of course, being married to a diver has its perks: The upside is that Kris pursues  me  with the same passion I spoke of earlier. The downsides (note the use of the plural indicator "s")  are worthy of individual attention. I will explore each one separately in my upcoming entries. I leave it up to you to decide whether to laugh or to cry...

      The most common question that I am asked when people find out what Kris does is, “Aren’t you lonely?”. What people don’t seem to realize is that there is a difference between being lonely and being alone. The truth is that I kind of enjoy this time to myself; it gives me the opportunity to explore my interests and to be independent.  Besides, I don’t understand why everyone pities me – Kris is the one off in the middle of nowhere on some barge without television or Internet or women for miles and miles. I, on the other hand, get to spend our time apart in the comfort of our house, with our friends and with easy (and frequent) access to the charge card. Personally, I think that Kris is the worse off of the two of us, so aim your pity in his direction.  In fact, a recent experience made me realize just how scary this lifestyle of frequent travel can be for divers: Kris and I decided to switch banks and, since he was going offshore that night, I was in charge of making any necessary changes. Before he left, I had him sign and void a check for me to give to his company's accountant for the direct deposit of his paycheck. When I called the next morning, I was informed that, despite my legal rights as his wife, and the fact that we share a joint account, it was company policy that only the employee could make changes to the direct deposit. Why, you may ask, must his company be so difficult? Perhaps its time I introduced you to Jodi.  Jodi is the name of the man that every diver fears for he is the man who is sleeping with your wife while you are away at work. Nothing pleases a seasoned diver more than to regale the newlywed, young, wide-eyed tender with tales of the dreaded Jodi. In fact, Jodi is so scary, that many tenders have quit their jobs for fear of their young brides finding comfort in his arms.  Jodi was actually named during the Viet Nam war. Originally, Jodi was the military name given to draft dodgers. The idea was to train young draftees to despise Jodi for staying behind while they honorably served their country. Of course, as a young, naiive soldier, you were told that Jodi was a filthy being who, not only sherked his duties as an American, but who also took the opportunity, while you were away, to move in on your unsuspecting wife. So, first you learned to hate Jodi; then you learned to associate Jodi with the enemy; next you learned to hate the enemy. Isn't brainwashing fun? Amazingly, still today, the fear of Jodi lurks in the hearts of all married men who work offshore.  The reason I bring up Jodi is to illustrate the point that some divers cannot trust their wives. This sad but true fact is so common that it explains why Kris’ company will not allow me to make changes to his banking information. I assure you that I am not just jumping to conclusions; the accountant told me point blank that this was the reason for the policy.  When Kris first got his job, he told me that a tender at his company had recently quit. Apparently, he was married to a professional cheerleader who seemed to think that her husband would be diving for oil out of their backyard. Or, at least, that is all I can figure because this young man was sent offshore on his first job and, two days in, received a frantic phone call from his wife threatening to divorce him if he did not come home immediately. Some women just can’t handle the pressure. The saddest stories that I hear are of women who take their husbands' earnings and skip town without warning. These women are famous in commercial diving legend and are the inspiration for strict company policy when it comes to paychecks.  Somewhere between Jodi and these glorified-prostitute wives, divers must be very cautious about whom they trust. The companies that they work for are forced to implement some extreme policies to protect their workers. Whether you dive or not, I guess it is a pretty sick world out there. Everyone handles the stress differently. Take me, for example: I am not a cheater or a thief, but my shoe collection is quietly growing…
