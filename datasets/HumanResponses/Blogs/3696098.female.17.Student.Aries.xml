      So i knew from the start i should get my own blog, just for me, just as Dave said.  My head is a puddle of thoughts right now waiting to explode. Guys. Arn't guys the cause for everything? I'd say so. And one thing about guys is...they never EVER know the right things to say.  Today has been well crap. I have spent most of my day pondering, moaping, crying over Tom. Well not really crying, just a few tears. The fact is he will never know how much i love him, and how i would do anything for him. The truth is he just doesnt care. Well why should he? I have a boyfriend now. The fact is i will never be able to get over him. I could never love anyone like him. Of course i cant exactly tell him that. I try but i think he gets a little freaked out. Which is understandable. I'm like pouring my heart out to him. I wonder if he ever loved me. That's something that is always gonna play on my mind.  I don't really talk to him anymore. I always want to, but i dont cos i know how it will upset me, what with him being in England, and me now in f'in canada. Aww it's like one of those tradgic love novels you read. Heh. Well kinda... Anyway back to my point. He starts a conversation with me every now and again. It starts off fine then memories come back. Gahh i hate them. I think the worst thing for me though is seeing how much he has changed. I told him i will never love anyone as much as him. Yeh great move kelly he's already not good at commitment. But well i can't have commitment with him anyway. *sulks* he called our love 'Puppy love'. What the hell is puppy love? I don't want puppy love.  The other problem is AJ. I am realising how much i love him also more and more. I don't want to be in love with two guys!? AJ is so good to me, and im happy, but its the simple fact i will never be able to get over Tom. End of story.  Wow glad i could get that out. I wrote a popem whilst waiting for my damn sister to get off the comp so i could start this. I desperatley needed to pour it out!  Love is a strong word i wish i never had to say, giving my heart away day after day.  Love is a strong word but i said it to you, knowing how i felt, so deep and so true.  Love is a strong word, you once said to me, little did i know it wasn't meant to be.  Love is a strong word, and now i take it back, burn it with my memories and tears i held back.

       This is me posting for the happiness of mr david Lee.    &nbsp;  A penis.&nbsp; All guys are given the gift of a penis, but really is it a gift?&nbsp; Well obviously for sexual purposes its a gift, otherwise its like a very bad friend.&nbsp; One of those friends who stears you in the wrong direction, Gives you bad ideas and leads you astray.    &nbsp;  Once the penis is in control it takes over. Im sure you wonder what the hell i am talking about?    &nbsp;  I have just got back from a cottage with my boyfriend and his family.&nbsp; I had a great time, i really did...apart from a few things.&nbsp; No sex for two weeks due to the fact we had no condoms. It wasnt really a big deal, we could still have fun.    &nbsp;  It was very hot at the cottage and being in the sun makes you very tired, and maybe even give you a headache as it did me.&nbsp; That night in particular when i wasnt feeling so good i was ready to go to bed. I was not up for the fooling around we did on the sofa as i did not feel very well.&nbsp; I tell AJ im off to bed and he flips out.    &nbsp;  He was so angry at the fact i didnt feel well and that he wasnt going to get any. Fuck you. :Growls: I told him im not well, and he sulked like the big baby he is.&nbsp; I got angry and was like fine, ill stay and then i'll go to bed. He was like "im sorry". Your sorry? Your sorry for keeping your sick girfriend up just so you can have some fun.&nbsp; What an idiotic, arsehole kinda thing to do.    &nbsp;  The penis was in control. Thats what he says. It definatley has a mind of its own, and over powers his actually mind.&nbsp; Can you see why i'm angry?    &nbsp;  This wasn't just on one occasion but on a few.&nbsp; If he didnt get any every night he sulked. It made me so angry.    &nbsp;  My conclusion: The penis controls which is why guys are such jerks...most of the time.    &nbsp;  DramaQu33n    &nbsp;

      Right now i feel...well i wish i knew.  I'm having doubts, worries, somethig just doesnt feel right and i don't know what or why. I'm guessing maybe something to do with AJ. I think its about time i ask myself WHY exactly am i going out with him, because i really dont know. If you asked me to draw up a list i wouldn't be able to. Sure its great to be with him, but i just dont think my heart is in it, i dont think its ever been in it. He'll sign on msn, i couldnt care less if he talked to me or not, surely thats not teh way it should be.  Lets talk about his possesiveness, if that even is a word. The other day AJ says to me "what would you rather do, live without me forever or marry me?" Now this question cam as quite a shock. Knowing what he wanted to hear i said "i'd marry you", which is infact a lie. I always fiond myself telling him what he wants to hear to save an argument, or even face reality about how i really feel. The conversation progressed and he said to me "So, if you dont get landed immigrancy you can marry me!" I was stunned and replied with a lot of "dont be rediculous", "that will never happen"'s. I told him i wouldnt marry him. I would not leave my parents and my family and the life i once had back home to marry him, especially at 17. So he says "ok i'll move to England then." OMG, what the hell have i done? He goes on about what if he had a job in england, a place to stay... It would NEVER happen. Never will i or can i see myself marrying him. He is so possesive over me that it scares me sometimes. I'm not sure i really want to be in a relationship. I am forced to say "i love you" whether i mean it or not, again to save from an argument. I don't know i just really don't, and again i find myself coming back to Tom. I know i should let go, i think he has even told me that but i cant see it happening. Everyday i'd look forward to seeing him, try and catch him around school and give him a little smile. He made me feel inceridble, and teh happiest i have ever been in a relationship. AJ will never be able to do that.  So what...am i looking for too much? Looking for what i had before? I wish i knew i really do, and i wish i knew why i was still with AJ. I find myself flirting with people, mainly online and i shouldnt be doing that, but maybe i just want to be free and have some fun?  Dave if you could shed some light on this it would greatly be appreciated you filthy pee-er!  I'm sorry if that made no sense :/  DramaQu33n
