      Heh, once again I'm waking up at about 1:30. ^^ I love being able to do that during the summer. I guess I'm compensating for the school year. *gags* I hate school.  So yesterday I woke up at about 1:00 and got in the shower, cleaned and such, and then I decided that I was going to walk up to my friends house, which isn't really all that far, but there's this really fucking steep hill you have to walk up and then down. And then she's at the end of the street. Well, the sun was out and it was pretty warm, but not too bad, but I was stupid enough to wear a black shirt and pants. I got so hot, but cooled down after I started nearing her house. So I got to the door, rang the doorbell like twice and nobody answered. So, then, kind of frustrated with being ditched when plans were made, and still a little warm, I walked back home, and by that time it was just so 'ugh' and hot that I went up to my room and put on shorts and a tank top. (Mind you that I NEVER wear shorts) So I came home and by that time it was about 2:30...so I came downstairs and got on the computer, and CJ IMed me, wanting to know if we could do anything, so It turned out that they were going to show up here at my house at about 7. So Mike and CJ showed up, and we walked up to Erica's ONCE AGAIN, but this time it was alot cooler. So we went up and got Erica, who wasn't exactly dressed. She was in her pajamas. But she left with us anyway, and we walked down to Jill's house to recruit her. Well, she already had some friends over so she couldn't come with us, so we invaded her house and took a bunch of soda and CJ grabbed this huge bag of chips. So we sat around and Mike and I watched "End of World" on the computer and "Before you vote!" which is a Bush-Bashing Flash animation with a song by NOFX called "Idiot son of an asshole". And then we watched Badgers do Euro 2004. It's hard to explain, so you'd have to watch it. Then we all sat around and watched forest gump, and erica decided she wanted to leave and get changed and that she was going to meet us back at my house in like 20 minutes. So, about 15 more minutes of Forest Gump, and CJ munching on chips...and we decided to get up and go. We said out goodbyes and headed out to my house. When we got there CJ fucked around with the remote to see if he could figure out how to work it. Surprisingly,  he figured it out. lol. So we watched Rockzilla till about 9 and then switched it over to "Who's Line is it anyway?". That is the  best show in the entire world, and it was so funny. Probably one of the funniest ones I've seen. ^^ so we watched that until about 10, and then we left to walk Erica home, and then by  the time that we got back down to my house (with random stops to pick up sticks and name them) at about 10.30. So, I said my good-byes to the boys and went inside. I went in to my room and with nothing better to do at 10:30, I watched Elimidate, one of the gayest shows in the world. Then I watched The Drew Carey show for an hour (I love Drew Carey) and then I was flipping through chanels and started to watch "Nova" on Fireworks. That was one of the most confusing but interesting things I've ever seen. It showed how fireworks were made and what you use and stuff...it was crazy. So then, after that, I turned it off and rolled over and tried to sleep like a thousand million times, but from 2:30-3:30 all I did was toss and turn. And then I finally fell asleep. Hey, I got about 10 hours, so that's good ^^.  So today, I'm figuring I'm just going to chill and kind of rest up. I have Kelly's birthday party tomorrow and I swear to god we'll be running ourselves out. lol. I think it'll be really cool. We're going up to Lake LocLavon and we're going to do some swimming and stuffs. It'll be really AWESOME. So yea. Well, nothing's really happened this day, so yea. And I'm on the phone with Kelly, and I don't really have anything else to say, so I'll write more tomorrow or later today if something happens.

      Well, so much for getting our internet ripped out. My mom cancelled once she realized that she wouldn't be able to work from home anymore if she did. *snickers* So yea, last night when we went to go see The Day After Tomorrow....oh my god it was the longest, most stupid, un-logical and confusing movie I've ever seen. And I was even paying attention. But, whatever, it was something to do I guess. I was driving there and back yesterday, and my dad was screaming at me all the time and I did just a horrible job. I'm never driving with him again. Stupid bastard. My mom's okay, though. But I swear to god if I had to drive with my brother, it better be for only a short distance, or I'd throw him out the window. So obnoxious.  There's nothing to do today. My brother went to go see "White Chicks" with his friend Jason, so we have some quiet time. My mom will be staining the deck and stuff, so that means I'm stuck in the house, possibly doing chores,ick, until somebody calls me with something to do or something. Whatever. I'm just patiently waiting for Brandon to get home. *sigh* so bored. I really don't have a plan for today, but I've only been up for about half an hour, so, I guess I shouldn't. Oh Tyler backed out of hanging out yesterday. I want to kick his spikey, mohawk ass. I had nothing to do until we had to go to that stupid movie. But oh well. Well, it's monday, so I have two days to sit around and do nothing until Brandon comes home. Woo and hoo. X_X This is going to suck. Maybe I should just go back to bed, and sleep all day, ya know? That sounds good to me. Yea ^^. Well, at least I'll be able to do something on Tuesday. Yea, my friend Erica asked me to do something, and so I'm saved for Tuesday.  I miss Brandon :(  Well, I am going to go clean my room and tell my mom that I vacuumed when I really didn't and sit around and play video games or something all day. I'll write more tomorrow or later when something actually happens.

      Well, last night was pretty interesting. We, as in Me Jill and Amanda, went to the Garage and I busted my ass all day to work and get a bunch of money to be able to go and do a bunch of things. Well, some of my money paid for a pack of cigarettes for both me and a friend, but mine ended up "running away" in Tyler's pocket. I'm still kind of mad at him. So I got a few from Josh Jaye. He's the bassist for Frequency, and he's really really good! so by the time I ended up at the garage I had three of 15 dollars left. By that time I had called my ex-boyfriend Tyler to ask him to come to the Garage because it was getting kind of boring and he's the most obnoxious, rambunctious person I know. So, he said he would go if he could get money, so he said he'd call me back. He called back and it sounded to me that he had money and he said that the only way he'd be able to get Nate to give him a ride, is if I could pay for Nate to get in. So I ran around and got two more dollars from two random people. I called Tyler back and told him that I had money to get Nate in and then he brought up the fact that he didn't have any money. So we were pretty much screwed anyway.    We stayed and Watched Frequency, and then ended up calling my cousin to come and get us and drive us back to Jill's house. One of the cigarettes I had stuck in my shirt (i didn't want it to break in my pocket) broke when I took it out. But I smoke the half of it that was left anyway. So we went back inside and I drowned the smell out of my breath with Cheez-Its, Dr Pepper and gum. Next thing we know Andy and Ryan are at the door wanting to hang out, so Jill let's them in. We hang out until about 11, when I go out foranother cig before leaving home. Another one fell out on to the ground and I accidentally stepped on it, and it broke! :( So the one I was smoking was my last one, but that was okay. So we  hung out for a little bit more, and then I came home and watched Life of Brian until I fell asleep.     You know what sucks, though? Brandon's band was supposed to be playing, and that was the reason I went. But he called me and told me that they had to back out because his Aunt had died in a motorcycle accident, and that they had to leave right away to drive up to Wisconsin for her funeral. Depressing. So he left Saturday, and won't be back till about Wednesday, or so I'm guessing. Oh well. I'll survive.  Now, today.  Woke up at about the usual 1:00. I called Tyler because we were supposed to do something toay but my dad freaked out at me and told me that we were doing something instead. But that's okay. So I guess we're going to go see "Day after Tomorrow" at 4:30 or something. Nothing else really happened, so I think I'll just write more...whenever.   I'm going to try and update as frequently as I can, because I'm getting my internet ripped out tomorrow :( NOOO!

      Sorry I haven't updated in a while...more like two days but oh well. I've been busy. Wednesday afternoon, I hung out with Brandon. And all day Thursday I hung out with him too. ::Rapture:: It was fun. We went to World Buffet for lunch and then went and saw white chicks. It wasn't as good as they make it look, but it was still funny. So that was fun.  He left at about...10:30. It was alot of fun too. We knocked this candle-holder off of my wall. He wanted me to go sit with him on the couch but I was sitting in a really comfortable chair, curled up in a blanket, and I really didn't want to move. So, he grabs me, and I hang on to the chair, and he picks me up, but I wont let go, so he starts to move away and the chair kind of tips, so I let go, and it scooted back and hit the wall and the candle-holder came down to the floor. Nothing broke thank God, and we put it back up like nothing happened and then I finally sat with him on the couch. So, then we watched MXC until about 10...then we watched Spongebob, and he left at like 10.30. Then I came inside and watched Family Guy and the Aqua Teen Hunger Force. And then I went to bed.   And now, today. I woke up at one. Cleaned me room and such. Had breakfast and watched Courage the Cowardly Dog. Yesterday was social day. Today is most likely be a loser day. Brandon works until about 3...and he said he'd call me when he got home, but I'm pretty sure he's going to practice since he's got a show at the Garage tomorrow. I think that'll go really well. I like the Garage, and I love music...so..hey! it's a win-win situation. :P It'll be alot of fun. They're playing with Tinted, Frequency, Y?, and a bunch more. I think it'll be really fun. Well, my plans for today are:     BE A LOSER!   woohoo! Yea, anyway. I'll see if I can find time to type more tomoorw because I have Collin's part at 5, and then I have to get to the Garage around 7....Meh, I'l type more tomorow...hopefully.

      How sad. (Yes so very sad) Shut up, stop thinking. Brandon's been very busy lately...And I respect it.  (Then act like it) I really do...But when it comes time for seeing each other...Do I need to say more? (No more!) Then I won't.   Today was just..Not all that great. I finally had gotten to sleep after my two posts last night, at around 5. At about 7, the phone rang. It was my dad, no doubt, who is on business in London. I got up to find the phone but couldn't, so it rang until it stopped. Figuring he'd just leave a message, I rolled over and tried to sleep again, just as I was starting to doze, it rang again. It was him. Didn't answer it again...Couldn't find the phone. I fell back asleep at about 7.30, but the phone woke me up again at 9. By that time I had found the phone since it was less dark...And answered. After I went upstairs and delivered the phone to my mom I went back downstairs and collapsed on to the couch. I slept until my brother came downstairs screaming and yelling and blaring music at 11. I told him to turn it down and shut up...Much to my surprise he listened and I was able to sleep until 1.30...but woke up to my mom bitching at me.  "Those dishes STILL aren't done!? Get up! Go do you job!And clean the basement before you come up, and then your room after the dishes!" So, I rolled off of the couch and cleaned the basement.As soon as I was done I went upstairs to do the dishes, my mom was already doing them and I asked her why. "Because they wont get done! You didn't come up here and do them like I told you to!" So, I told her that I was cleaning the basement and I had just come up to do them. She sent me away and told me to clean my room. After I did that...I sat on the computer and talked to old friends over IM until Brandon got here. (Quite a sad day.) It was a horrible day for me...started off wrong...got a little worse..and is still bad. (Quit whining!) ...I don't know why I'm making such a big deal about it. (Then stop) I have such a headache...   So, I'm possibly goig to get together with an ex-boyfriend who moved out here from Oregon in May. I haven't seen him yet, but after a sudden halt to the relationship..I don't really blame him..or me for that matter. (Get over it) It'll be good to see him though. I don't even know if we'll ever make plans or anything like that...but...oh well. Shit happens. (I tried telling you that earlier) Well, that was pretty much my day...   Oh joy...   I'll write more tomorrow night.

      Wednesday Morning. I'm still thinking. (maybe...too much)  I want to be an Artist.(But you'll never make it). I want to go to college for it...I want to do what I love. But...people don't seem to appreciate art as much anymore. Sure, you have your people who do...but now everybody's miniscule minds are focused on society, stereotypes, and social standings.  (everyone's judging you)  The only thing is...is you don't get people out looking for someone to paint a large mural on their ceiling or on the side of a building anymore, you know? They don't care anymore.  It'll be really hard. And now all I can do is think. (Stop! Stop thinking) It's all I have left right now. (Bullshit).  ....  I don't want to fail...        ....again.

      I think too much... (you're always thinking) I always do this (stop)  I can't help but think. (then stop thinking)  Every time I go to sleep at night...I get afraid...Afraid of not waking up in the same room. I can only wonder...what if everything around me...will slip from my fingers? Running through them like dry sand, unattainable...unable to get the same small grains back. (Afraid?) When I'm on the phone with Brandon...What if I ask him a question...and he's not there? I only hear a dial tone...like he was some fond thought played out in my head...and thought real? What if none of this were real? (...None of it's real?) What if I were dreaming? (...dreaming....) But the pain is real.   I feel lost...I don't know what to do. The death of some of my friends...were they sick thoughts running through my head; wishing them ill? What if *I* killed them...in this dream? What if I were the drugs...what if I were the uncontrollable emotion of suicide? But no...it couldn't be that. What if...  What if....  Always wondering. Always thinking. I do this too much.  My friends. Are they really my friends? Are they just people....(of course they are...)....who pretend? Do they smile to my face and sneer at my back? Or are they really there? I'm afraid that if I touch them....they will slip in to me, fuse back in to my mind. To be lost in the fragments of my memories. My mind.  And Brandon. Will he dissappear? Will I lose him too, to the creativeness my mind projects? What if, when we hug to say goodbye when he leaves my house...he doesn't come back? What if....  What if...  He's gone?                  I guess I'm just afraid.  Afraid to lose them. All of them.                 .............     Afraid to be alone.                 ...such a sad person.     {Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there. With opens arms and open eyes}  I wish.  But I can hold my own. As long as I can stay like this...I won't lose them.     I won't lose him.

      Wow. It's been a while since I've updated this thing. OKay, let's start from the 4th...  - I went to my Uncle's house, as usual, like we always do every single year. But Brandon was going to meet me there after he got off of work at like 7. So, he met me there, we had dinner, hung out for a little bit, but he wasn't able to stay the entire time because he had to go with his family to their neighbors house. But he invited me to go along. So, I asked my parents, but they were being dousche's and said no. So Brandon left we played around with fireworks, I started hanging out with my cousin Mandy (20) and we had some fun. Then she left alittle later and went to her friends house, so she came back with some weed. That was fun. I smoked like three bowls alone and so did she then we shared the fourth one, so, yea. It was fun. Then she gave me some to take home. So, yea. I've never slept that good in like..my entire life. On to the 5th!  -I can hardly even remember what I did the fifth. I think I hung out with Brandon, but I'm not sure. Can't really recall that day. o.0  -The 6th...I hung out with Brandon again. I think. Yea. I did. Yea! that was fun! We went out to Quizno's for lunch, and then stopped at Barnes and Noble and looked through the Kama Sutra. But whta was best aboutt hat...was it was Pocket version! lol. So we looked through that and stuff, and it was fun. Then we came back to my house and watched Nightmare before Christmas and then messed around and stuff and then he left at about 6. It was really fun. I loved that day.  -And yesterday...wow...that was great. So the original plan for me and Brandon for yesterdat was, was that his mom was working, so the house was empty. And I was going to go over there and we were gonna have fun and suff. Well, it turned out that his mom had taken the entire week off. Which sucked. So he ended up coming over here at like 1. We hung out until about 6, and then we all left to go watch my parents play Volleyball. Which was awesome. Because we didn't really watch them lol. We said we were going to DQ at like 7. So that gave us a little over an hour. ^^ lol. So we went to some random parking lot. Which was funny because it was a church parking lot. So yea. Cranked up the Used in his cd player, and had fun. lol. It was about 80° outside, and we still managed to fog up the windows. LOL! So, by about 8:10 we headed back to the Volleyball games, and they weren't quite done yet, so that gave me a little time to calm down and cool off. So that was cool. Then he took me home and my parents went out and he went home to get some stuff done. Then he called me at about 10, and we talked till close to eleven then we both went to bed. It was fun. So, on to today.  I was feeling really sick today. And I couldn't figure out why. So I laid around, complained, and just felt really icky. So then I found out that I had started my period. Self-explanatory. So it was because of that. I have had cramps that knock a horse off of it's feet, make it seizure and then kill it. They suck. So I'm drugged up on like 4 Ibuprofen, a heating pad, and they're still really bad. So, I laid around all day, waiting for Brandon to get home from work  today at about 8:00, and stuff like that. So, I'm on the phone with Brianna who just got back from Hawaii. So, it's all good. Yea, so, I don't know what the plan is for tomorrow, so I'll write more tomorrow.

      Well, Firday was fun. Hung out with Brandon, went swimming, watched movies, had a bonfire at his house. It was all good. I missed him alot and when he came back thursday night, they got home at like midnight. But oh well- I was extatic to see him ^^.  I saw Spidermna 2 today. it was pretty good; could have been a little better but Spirderman 3 is going to own. The story line was pretty good, and the acting was phenomenal. I like the effects...and it was really pretty good.  I don't really have anything else to say...this is one of my shorter entries I guess. Tomorrow's the 4th, so I'll probably end up writing earlier in the day.

      Well, Kelly's birthday party was pretty cool. I got there a little late, but it was worth it. We went swimming for a little bit and hung out on the water trampoline and the lil floaty dock with a diving board. It was alot of fun. So, we swam until about 5...and then went and sat on the beach for a lil bit; ate, talked, some of us smoked. But yea, you get the picture. So then we decided that we wanted t go in and watch movie and such. They were arguing over watching School of Rock or 28 days later, until someone suggested Gothika. So we decided on that. So Maddie went and got her movie and we put it in. It's actually a really good movie, the underlying story is awesome, and the acting is good, but I think they should've chose someone else other than Halle Berry. But whatever. So, halfway through the movie, you could tell Maddie was getting freaked out, so she used the most common human manuever to avoid it: flippancy. She was always making jokes about the movie, and commenting on almost everything they said. When we told her to shut up, she said "It's  my  movie, I can do what I want." Then, at that moment, I realized that Maddie is a stuck up bitch and I feel really bad for her boyfriend, Jojo. Luckily for Maddie, I didn't say anything to her, and didn't realy want to; because I didin't want a fight to break out, especially at Kelly's birthday party, ya know? See, unlike little miss mine, I have courtesy and respect for people. I swear to god I'm never watching a movie with Maddie ever again. Kelly and Chris got kind of bad too....Chris would kind of egg Maddie on, and then Matt would start and then Maddie would finish, and almost everyone else would laugh. I almost left a few times, but decided not to. So, after the movie, Chris and I went down to the Lake to feed the fish and stuff. Then Matt came down and then the rest of them came too. So we sat there and fed the fish and it was about...9:00 or something when we did. We sat out there for like 10 or 15 minutes, and then we went back inside and played DDR and had cake. I ended up leaving at about 9:45, cuz my mom came early because my Uncle was at our house and wanted to spend some time with me before bed and stuff.And holy crap he is a freaking idiot! We lit off some fireworks, and there was one that was like  a orcket or something and you wqere supposed to stick it in the ground. Well, what does he do? He holds it! He did it with a roman candle too. So I went home and hung out with my uncle, and we watched Futurama, Family Guy and Aqua Teen Hunger force. So then he decided that he was gonna crash in the basement, so I went back upstairs to my room and watched The Drew Carey show ^^. Then I ended up falling asleep, cuz I was really tired. My uncle woke me up at like 5:30 this morning to say good-bye because he had to drive back down to Aberdeen for a wedding that was at like 3, or something. And it's a five hour drive and he had to go buy a suit or something, so I don't blame him for leaving that early.  I had the weirdest dream last night. It was just a bunch of crazy stuff. And Brandon was in it. It was crazy. So yea,  Well, I'm thinkin I'm gonna go hang out with Brandon.

      Wow, today was...Weird. I don't know where the sudden wave of honesty come from but I admitted to my mom that I smoked and stuff like that.@[smiley: Frown: [29/29_1_8]] never again. That sucked. But hey, it scored me an almost $100 bikini from 'Everything but water' in Mall of America. Good store ^^ I got it for Kelly's party today- we're, as you know going to LocLavon, and I needed a suit. SO yea. But, $100, can you believe it?!? Prices are just soo high for things right now. Why do they always have to go up? >.  Well, so anyway. It's a ROXY brand, so it's white with like brown roxy flowers and stuff and cool designs on it. Yea, I know what you're thinking: Brown!? Ew! Right? well, it actually looks really good, and since I'm actually tan this summer, and the fact that my hair is brown, it looks pretty good. The only thing I'm afraid of is, is that it ties in the back and around my neck, so people could easily pull it and it would just come down. That would suck. I think Kelly's party is going to be fun! ^^ Even though it's kinda hot outside, but that's what the water's for!! ^^ The mall was fun. Lol the guy working in 'Everything but water' was gay, which is cool, because then he offers professional guy oppinion. Lol! So, yea we walked in and he was all 'so what can I get for you darling? are you looking for anything in particular?' and when we told him 'no', his eyes lit up and he's all 'can I offer an oppinion?' so, we went around the store, and he was all 'red would look really hot on you!' and he picked out all these different kind of bathing suits, and they were all really cool. It made our job easier at least. And he was so helpful. He would have me model each suit for him and he would tell me what he honestly thought- and that's good! So we decided on the one he liked best, and the same one I really liked, and my mom liked, so it was all good. I love that guy. There needs to be more employees everywhere like him!^^  My uncle's supposed to come out here today. Which is cool. He's from Mississippi, and is in love with guitars. I think he's really like Brandon, they're both rockers, lol, and I'm sure they could talk guitar and really get along. I guess my uncle was down in Aberdeen, South Dakota, with my cousin Zach and my aunt Debbie. My aunt's parents live down there, so they're out seeing them. But I think only my Uncle paris is coming to see us, because Zach is working (and getting paid $18 an hour! to do nothing!gah!) for his grampa, and Aunt Debbie's just helping around the house. So that will be fun.  Speaking of Brandon, I think he's still up in Wisconsin. Which is kind of sad and depressing because I've not seen him for about a week. Well, technically it's been 6 days, but whatever, it's almost a week. :P I really really miss him and I was looking forward to seeing him at Kelly's but I don't know if he's going to show or not. Or when he's going to be home. It's all...lonely here.@[smiley: Crying: [29/29_1_3]]  well, nothing else is really going on, So I'll write more after Kelly's party!   R O C K O N ! ! !   @[smiley: Head Banger: [15/15_8_200v]]

      Wow, it's almost been a month since I've updated. Alot has happened.  Through most of July...I just hung out with Brandon and Brianna...And I've been keeping a separate diary. But oh well. I spent some time up at the rat and insect-infested mudhole we call our "cabin" and then came home and hung out with Brandon a little more.  But there was one night, that I had alot on my mind, and after talking to E, he told me that one of our friends smokes Marijuana to help her sleep. SO I figured, hey, maybe I could actually get some sleep for once and not be tired and be able to enjoy the day at the spa with my mom. Well, I was wrong. I got caught, in trouble, supposedly grounded (they never really enforced it) and now I'm seeing a Psychologist.  Nothing really exciting happened though. Now I'm on the phone with Ernie.  lol, I love E. He's great. He's like my big brother.  I saw The Village yesterday it was really good; alot better than I thought it would be. The movie had an unexpected twist, and it was just so incredibly awesome. M. Knight Shymalan is such a creative man, I want to see more from him. If you haven't seen it, and you don't want me spoiling anything...then don't read this.  So, as you know, there are "monsters" or, "Those who we do Not speak of" to keep the Villagers from going in to the woods. And that if you went in to the Woods they would break the "truce" and then they would come out and kill and such things like that. Well, there was a guy who actually went in to the woods, and then the creatures started appearing and stuff. They'd kill little animals and strip them completely of their fur. And they'd put red marks on the door.  Well, it turned out that they actually lived in modern times, and they wanted to keep the innocence in the village, because ever adult who lived there, had a relative killed in the city, so they wanted to protect the kids and people of the Village. So they made up the creatures so that they would stay away. It was really awesome but also kind of confusing. At first it was, but once you got in to it and such, it was completely awesome and worth seeing.  Well, nothing else has really happened, other than the fact that I'm leaving on Friday to go to A wedding in Detroit, and then going over to Canada for another wedding. Oh man, that'll suck. Lol. Two weddings. Great. Oh well, it'll be fun.  Well, I'll write more tomorrow. I doubt anything will happen.
