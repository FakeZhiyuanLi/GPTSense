      ok school reopened today, DAMMIT i hate it, why can't the holidays be forever or longer. A lot of problems arouse when i got back to school, first my maths holiday homework was not complete and i had to see my stupid form teacher, a dam bloody HYPOCRITE, try to act as though nothing happened and try to act INNOCENT, try to act as though he is my friend, huh dam pissed see his face, bloody no good for nothing, you wanna tell me something, tell me directly on the face, DON'T BADMOUTH ME BEHIND MY BACK!!!!! bloody hell if i had the equitment and money and the authority and power, i am going to place him under my creation of "101 types of very painful and slow types of sadistc torture" by Lucien Phua, then he will not try and double-cross me, or better just slice his head off clean, then take it and feed the pigs, the body also!!!! ok continuing on well nothing has changed about my class except a classmate of my class transferred school to punggol secondary school or something, by whatt the other said, so if he reads this all i have to say is Yih Dar good luck in anything you do, we will be missing you. Alrighty then continuing off, well most of my teachers have not change, except there is a sudden surge in the no. of female teachers who dyed their hair, but none of my teachers have changed, but there was a funny thing that my chemistry teacher, miss queenie chua has forgotten most of our names or to be exact, she can't remember shermans name and when she ask him what was his name, yong rui kept on saying 'sheman sheman' and she was dam confused and said sheman and sherman, but finally she remembered his name was sherman, while i just sat in my seat and laughed in contemplation of his suffering, in others words i am just being a sadist enjoying sherman sufferring muhahahahahahahahahahaha oh yeah for those who do not know laughing in contemplation of other peoples suffering in short means sadist. okback to where we werei fainally got back my no.1 uniform, oh god i missed it and tommorrow i have to pay jeremt ng $5.40 for the corporal rank for the no.1 uniform. so after school i went home, but had to get back to school for NCC day rehersal, bloody hell colin chia and guang yi liang say i don't want them to go for the standard first aid course, bloody hell is you all who said that you don't want to go because it was too expensive, so now you all want to go, when last term you all said that you didn't want to go, it is your fault you all didn't want to go not mine, if you want to blame people don't blame me, blame yourselves for not wanting to go to the course. so wer had to rehearse for the NCC day parade,at first i had nothing to do, but suddenly si4r wie jie ask me to go up to replace matthew heng as announcer as he was not there for the rehersal and i was dam nervous as it was my first time. so we finished the rehersal, had our meeting and then went home. tommorrow is going to be a long day first lesson will be my crazy english teachers lesson, bloody ang moh. ok i won't continue anymore4 ok i want to sleep now dam shagged ok bye!!!!

      As i sit in the darkness of my room typing this on my com, typing what i feel about myself or something, i suddenly ask myself what i have really become!!!!! Well i tell you something, i have become one person whose heart has no love or compassion or anything. I have no dam feelings for anything or anyone, call me heartless if you want to but that is what i am!!!! Coburn yesterday told me that i could get the gal of my dreams if i tried, huh that i will never believe, because i know that i do not have the looks to have a gal notice me!!!! in fact i don't think any gal will ever notice me!!! because i know i don't possess the good looks to get a gal to notice me. ok back to the top, well some people may ask why i have no love or compassion in my heart, well i can tell you why. Because nobody has shown me love, care ,compassion or even concern. instead before i lost my humanity in my heart, i had a lot of it in my heart, but everybody just treated me like trash, no one respects me and the things i do, i am just a person to be used or pushed around, some of them even back stabbed me even though i help them, to everyone in my school or in NCC i am just one extra, nothing more and nothing less. That is when i had it, i told myself why should i show love and compassion to anything or anyone huh!!! nobody respects me at all so why should i even give a hint in even showing a bit of compassion to any of them!!! that is why from then on i have become a heartless person,my hearthas no feelings , no remorse or sadness or even pity, just emptiness nothing more and nothing less. Some may say i am a sick violent sadistic bastard, but i don't really care, so long as any person who dares cross my path, he will pay dearly and wish he never did!!!! While i will just stand there and savour every moment he suffers hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!! ok so this year i won't be expecting any Happy birthday wishes to me or even presents this year, i will just ask me parents to put me up in some fancy restuarant with a large buffet and just enjoy myself!!!!!!!! and to think my birthday is only 21 days from now!!!!!!!!!

      Dam shagged and pissed today!!! first of all i went to Willy's house to do the stupid PE project, if you think about it, who in this goddam world would do a PE project. Well i can tell you 1 person who is dumb enough to do that, that person is Sherman Low Cher Nguan. He is the only dofus idiot in this world who is so loving and so dam trusting to his other friends on the internet except me and willy who have help him so many dam times!!!! ok continuing on when i arrived at willys house, i thought i am the earliest considering the fact that i arrived there at 9.30am, but noooooooooooo someone was earlier then me and worse he was the loser that suggested that we do finish the project, instead he was playing DOD(Day of Defeat) that wasn't bad enough well listen to this. When my mum who invite them for lunch out of her kind heart, but instead stupid sherman talk rubbish in the car saying a lot of rubbishh, as it progresses it starts to get worse, then there was this stupid no good for nothing auntie who's dam fucking job was to just sell drinks, but no she had to be a busybody and comment on our seating and when we move our place, huh i tell ya go and suan me, when she was gone and walked away i said to myself she was a busybody and then my mum scold me. Why can't that stupid aunties just shut her gap and do her job, but she just had to be a stupid no good for nothing busybody. Then we went back to willy's house and play more DOD instead of finishing the project, whats more the one who got us there in was just playing and playing and playing non-stop, worst of all throughout the whole afternoon he was suaning me all the way. Oh the temptaton i had to slit his throat with my knife that time, even when i told him i was going for counselling and was telling them how i hated it, he was just making fun of it. So what if i have no love of compassion in my heart, he has way too much, in my opinion i never trust anyone that much, unless i really know the person very well, if not i never trust that person, only my best friends who really know me know what kind of person i am. then i got home, my mum just like yesterday just keep on nagging at me non-stop, ohhhh how i wish i have a gun a bomb or even better a nice clean sleak and sharp samurai sword and slice sherman, that stupid coffeeshop auntie and my mums head, then i will just stand there in great satisfaction and laugh non-stop, that will tell them not to mess with me hahahahahahahaha. But most of all i want to slice is Sherman Low Cher Nguans head, i am telling you even though i relax on him a bit and try to forgive him for what he has done to me and Willy dosen't mean i totally forgive him, today i just tolerated him, but if he pushes me a bit more one more time, he might have an even worse fate then what he previously had from me, EVEN WORSE I TELL YOU!!!!!!!. now i am listening to all of Linkin Parks songs and it is so dam good that it is making me more angry and aggravated that i want to kill Sherman now!!! but i am just tolerating until he pushes it to far, then he will suffer hahahahahahahahaha, if he will read this let it be a warning. ok need to do that online chemistry homework now so this is when i say BYE!

      *ways to Torture a Cat*   Many times I have wanted to beat the shit out of that furry little bastard  that always seems to piss me off.  Either by taking a nice warm shit on my  brand new carpet, or decided to use me as a clawing device.     I'd like to suggest ways to hurt or piss off the little shithead that you  can't get rid of, usually cause you're mom thinks it's the nicest fucker alive.    1  --  Kick it Around, you know, when the fucker get's in your way, whether it be when you're taking a shit and it comes in and watches, or when you're sleeping and it sits on your face.  Just put a little force into it and BLAM! The fucker goes flying.  It's especially nice to watch a cat go flying on a wood floor, with all four spread, doing 360's and crying like a Mexican without his burrito.  Kicking him from under (like under the stomach) let's loose a flying cat, spinning and twirling in the air.              2  --  Tail tricks....This is the fun part...Seeing the cat can't really get to it's tail, you can do shit with it and the cat it defenseless.  Try tying the cat's tail to his front paw, cause everyone time it walks, it's tail get's pulled, looks like some diseased person trying to walk.  Or even better, get a nice grab of the tail, and start spinning the cat around using it, the cat will have to take the pain, cause by force of nature, it can't reach it's paws around to scratch you since it's spinning so fast it's paws are spread-eagle like.  If you have glue, and the cat's tail is long enough, or maybe just a tad shorter, you can glue it's tail to it's nose, which is cool.  The cat moves his head and his ass comes up with it (how'z that for a chain reaction?)  Like it'll be walking around town with it's ass all dangling up, all the other furry fucks will ram it up, which in turn, will make the cat freak when it tries to sit down (get it?).  But that's kinda mean.  3 -- whiskers (heh, heh, heh)....Ok, you know who you are people, you kind that clips cat's whiskers and laughs like hell.  Cat's use whiskers to navigate in the dark, like when they're entering a tight spot, their whiskers will tell them if they're about to run into something (kind of like those cadillacs with those metal tubes sticking out the side).  So what do you do?  You cut the fuckers whiskers, down to you start getting fur.  Then you gotta through the cat in a closet, and open the door, oh, about 4 inches.  The cat will naturally be fucked and stunned that us humans would do such a thing (it probably is equlivant of a cat cutting off your dick) and he'll start bumping around, wondering what the fuck....So you just sit there and laugh your ass off.  The cat might eventually make it's way out of the closet, but maybe you could, hmmm...  4  --  Pillow Case....Well, this is kind of funny...All you do is throw the little fuck in a pillow case, and go into an open room (you don't want to beat it to death, well, not yet atleast). And start swinging the fucker around in circles, again and again, the cat will probably be crying for it's life (but don't give in to it's whining, cause when it get's out, it wants blood) keep swinging it around and around, faster and faster, stop when you're too dizzy to figure out where the cat is, then quickly open the pillow case and let the bastard fall out (it WILL fall, believe me). You got to make sure you can see it (cause you're gonna be almost as dizzy).  The fucker will be sitting there, moving it's head in circles, still thinking its spinning. This is the good part, cause as far as the cat knows, it's totally high on Catnip or something.  You can do anything, it's up to you.  4  -- Water  ...We all know that cats hate water more than dogs, and would rather travel in a car then deal with it.  But cat's are funny as hell in water. Try filling up a tub, or a sink, or something with water in it that the cat will fit in.  Throw the fucker in for a minute or two (unless it's definitely going to drown, we'll talk about killing them later) and watch it squeal..They act like water is acid or something and yet they still drink water out of the toilet when none is available (these fuckers gotta get their facts straight).  After the cat has had enough torture, grab it by the ear, or tail, or get a good grab around it's head and throw it out (throw it outside you fool). When a cat get's wet (especially a long-haired cat) they look like giant ferrets, really nasty like (which might persuade you to do something else, like nail it to a 2 by 4 and shoot it full of b-b's) but don't hurt it too bad..  5  --  Misc. shit....Stick the cat in the Microwave (no, really) and don't turn it on (yet) just let it sit there, and look through the little see-through window...It should be scared as hell, since it's in a really tight spot, can't move much at all...If you really want to screw the fucker, nuke it! Just nuke it for 20 seconds at a time...The cat will start squirming at about 10 seconds (depending  on  the  wattage  of  the Microwave)...After about 30 seconds, the cat will definitely have radiation poisioning, which will probably kill it within a month or less.  If you nuke it for a minute, you'll probably kill it, depending on the size of the cat, the microwave cooks inside out, so after a minute, it's intestines and lungs will be a little toasty, maybe killing it, if not, probably sterilizing it or leaving it a slow and terrible death.  Of course, you can go "All-Out" if you REALLY express rage for it, and can nuke it for 5 minutes...This is NOT for the Squeamish....I DO know someone who did this, and saw it....It was pretty fucking gross, and being the cat hater I am, I still felt sorry for it.  In 30 seconds, it starts kicking and screaming and freaking out (which brings me to the point, you gotta make sure the door can't be  opened, and you gotta make sure you don't want the microwave anymore).  In 1 minute, it was started to spaz like nothing you've ever seen before, some blood was coming from it's mouth due to internal cuts the Nuking did, all types of seisures and some last moans were following at 2 minutes.  At about 2 and a  half minutes, the cat was still alive, it's pupils were dialated and it was twitching like someone stuck a Electrolysis gun up it's ass...At 3 minutes, it's almost dead...The smell of the cat would make any mortician throw up, that's why I would suggest alot of open windows and doors and some type of gas mask on. The last two minutes it the cool part...Now that the fucker is dead (for good reason too) it's time to watch the fireworks...I think at around 4 minutes, the cat started popping, it's eyeballs literally popped out of it's sockets, and the blood started to ooze, not a pretty sight..At about, 4 mins 15 seconds, it's fur starts to curl (although it was already crispy) and at about 5 minutes, the whole microwave is one big slaughterhouse.  Which brings me to clean up...DON'T! I said earlier, Nuke the cat in a microwave you no longer want to use (not to mention the microwave is probably broken anyway).  Just throw the microwave away and chuckle off a couple laughs...Even take poloraids if you want.    (this article was given to me by a friend)

      Well i am updating my blog, despite the lack of time i have!!! ok here goes, today was my school's founders day, I tell ya it is not a nice experience, we the catholic boys have to sit in the hall for 1 hour to do what!!! huh I tell ya just to sing songs!!!!! i didn't sing a single thing as a lot of you people know i will never sing even if I am singing for my life, but it was better then staying in class and having chinese lesson, at least in the hall i could sleep and no one will give a hoot about it. ok so i stayed in the hall sleeping and talking rubbish to Benedict, oh my butt really hurts sitting there for 1 hour, but i manage to get out of the hall by telling a teacher i am going to the toilet, when in actual fact i went to the canteen to get a drink and i came back 15 minutes later, bloody hell saw Daniel Chye&nbsp; in the canteen, stupid bastard, think he very big shot that he is Staff Sergeant, Bloody hell i don't want to give you medic report man, simply why because i don't respect him, who he think he is i give my medic report to the ASM or CSM not to you!!!! ok so skipping that part, i went back to the hall, we had the Founder's day mass and i was sleeping with my eyes open or was i just sleeping normally, It was very hard to be awake, as our school's hall is so dam small and cramp!!! so i slept until end of mass went home, had to cut my hair as my mum was scolding me for the pass week that i cut my hair as it was dam long, i tell her billions and billions of times, my hair is not long, it is dam short and i look better like that, but i had no choice so i went to cut my hair, met Willy and Stupid no good for nothing Sherman there. I just don't get it sometimes, why bastards like him can have a GF, but his GF looks like some abomination so i will not continue on that, but i have been trying to pursuade Ade to delete him off her msn, but she refused to, saying that she pitied Sherman, ya got to be kiddding me man, pity him!!!!! don't know whats with her??? i should be the one to pity, see his face everyday, after he COMPLAINED to DK, he is back to acting like a big shot, because now i am not there to stop him, DK told me that if i did it one more time, he will suspend me!!!oh my sad sad life, now i have to plan another way to get back at him!!!!! i just don't understand how come people that are like Ade who are not my school friends&nbsp; but know sherman through msn cannot understand this conflict, instead of siding me as a friend, they side with the enemy, it is not just Ade, other prople also, i get support from my own classmates, most of them don't like Sherman!!!! but it is logical in a sense, how come people cannot see i used the differents way of trying to solve the problem, first i used Diplomacy, i talk nicely to him, but he didn't want to listen, so i used Aggressive negotiations, where i raise myself using myself, by scolding him and negotiating and also throwing the truth right in front of his face, but he still refuse to admit he was wrong so i declared war!!!! then he took notice and called a third party into it, i am using the strategy of politics and American way of solving problem's, like the Iraq war, i am using the same sstrategy, Diplomacy first, Aggressive negotiations 2nd and lastly if all else fails, WAR!!!!!!! But i tell ya one thing, my friends know i am a person who will never give up and stop something halfway, when i fight, i fight all the way till death!!! the peace now is just only a temporary cease-fire, so i can just declare war again!!!! ok so tommorrow is the POP!!! yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!! finally, but i cannot go for Cath. class, soooooooo saaaaaaaaad!!!!!! ok but the good thing is that i&nbsp;don't need to wake up early tommorrow morning, yes!!!!! finally can sleep late. ok i will end it here now i gotta get some rest, so dam tired, ok bye!!

      Well sunday was the NCC day parade, and boy was it a memoriable day. It started of when i woke up at 6am, for god knows why, because my parents told me to put my alarm clock at 6am, so i went to eat breakfast with them, then arrive at Amoy Quee about 15minutes earlier, we went in and as usual SEA is the most worst one, we drew the arms from the amoury, then went to practice our drills, after that we took a bus to get to SAFTI MI, i was sleeping in the bus, but at the same time i had to wake up sometimes, because my rifle kept on slipping out of my hand, so in actual fact i was only half asleep, hahahahahahahahaha. ok so we arrived at SAFTI MI and had our lunch, our luch so far was the best we had compared to the rest, we had western food and ice-cream. After that we went to the dam big parade square, had soem rehersals, slack a bit though, hahahahahahahaha and then we also had to practce a wet rehersal where we went into this hall and was told not to stamp o the floor or it might fall with the combine force of everybodies stamping, the only contingent was the Guard of honour contingent. well we then rested for a while, rehydrated ourselves and had to change, i was the only idiot who stuffed his no.1 uniform in the bag because my uniform cover was stolen by someone, i don't know who, so i was feeling dam inferior to everyone because my rank was a coporal and almost everyone had at least one badge in their uniform, but i later grdually felt more comfortable, because there were part B's whose rank was smaller then mine and had no badge so it was not at all that bad. So it was the moment we have all been waiting for, the moment we rehersed so long for, so we marched out as the Guard of Honour for the Sea district. God was not on our side that day, because we stood there for like i don't know maybe 1 hour or so, the sun was dam hot and my feet as killing me and my whole body was dam numb, the only movement we had was the presenting of arms and the wriggling of our toes which the spectatos could not see. So when the moment came for the march pass, it was a sigh of relief, at last finally the parade was going to be over, so we did the march pass, but the last part we screwed it up because we could not hear the RSM command for our heads to turn back to the original position, that part was a screw up, but in my opinion the whole parade was a success. We then gathered to the FUP and hydrated ourselves and took pictures at the same time, we were then given the confetti shooter or something and were told that at the grand finale, we were to run as fast as we could and make the whole place as messy as possible. So the moment came we stood in position and all of us charged forward with our rifles. The marits then all gathered at the place near where all the NCC coucil people were sitting and made a lot of noise and took our school flag, our part b's were allowed to join us, we jumped around like a bunch of mad people, also raising our rifles in the air and son on, then the national anthem was played and we stood in attention and sang the national anthem dam loudly, that moment was a moment i would never forget in my life, i will never trade anything for it, i wish i can relieve that moment again. so after the parade we went o return our arms, said goodbye to our Bukit Batok friends we made then gave Jonathon who will be leaving the US by next week or so, we are all going to miss him though. so we stayed back and help load the arms in the truck, then went for the reception for some refreshments and food. we were like the zai gor in there as our uniform was then best over there, oh i love my no.1 we also meet Sir Wong Kim Sim and Sir Domanic Tan of the pioneer batch of the Barracudas, we ended up going back at about 8pm. that day was the most memoriable time of my life, i will never trade anything for that moment. ok well i am also suppose to write about today also, well i went to school, made sherman lifes miserable, he snapped, told DK made a whole hooha out of it, but he actually dosen't know he is falling way down to my trap, muhahahahahahaahahahahaha, ok well Koh Siang Chen said she was disturbed by the fact that i am very scheming, but i told her the reason for my actions, i think she understood my situation. well history lesson we werte taught about the Ubited Nations, after that Mr. Wong played the role of the United Nations by trying to mediate for us and try to solve the problem, but i tell you the problem won't be slove so easily, my brain has hatch a plan, becausre i see no reason in what way i am wrong, because i am treating him the same way he is treating me, so we both are on par. This incident has raised the attention of our class alright, but i tell you one thing, the whole class know i am the one that is right, because a lot of people in our class don't like sherman as they say he is very proud. well now i have achieve something though, it has made the teachers don't like sherman as i have shown them who he realy is muhaahahahahahahahahahahaahhaahhahahahahhahahahhahaha ok so i will end it here, but one of the most freaky thing is that i don't know who reads my blog, but i don'tt know how my aunt found the address for my blog, i gotta go solve that, ok so i will end it here because i just got back form my maths tution at my cousin's house dam tired, but i still have to study, ok i will end it here now ok bye!

      ok my birthday was celebrated last satuerday on 10th of july instead of the actual day on the 9th of july, well it wasn't a good start that satuerday, i had to wake up dam early, as i had to go for NCC training, 6am man at dam time i was dam tired, but i knew that if i didn't go, they will have a lot of problem, as being the only qualified medic at the scene, i was the only qualified to treat the injured so i had no choice, well i arrived there, but log spec. had not arrived there yet so we had to wait for him to come before i could draw my medic kit and i resupplied it, as certain items had either expired or had finished. well the CO's parade was dam long, as Ms. Queenie Chua  our acting officer had certain principals, so the CSM had to do the checking and i tll you i took dam long, about half an hour to finish it man. so he dismissed us and the prepared for drill Lee Lee put think he so dam big huh!!!!! want to knock me down just because the things i do he don't like, fuck you man i tell you, who medic me or you huh!!!!!!!! lets not care about him, well like i was saying they had drill and i was like acting the idiot running here and there seeing my juniors do drill as i look and laugh, then the school band came and we had to clear the multi-purpose court. Coburn Kong the new CSM was dam pissed off man at that time, as the Part A and B drills really suck and when i say suck i really mean sucks man, Coburn even threatened to take away their games time if their drill dosen't improve, that must have scared te shit out of the Part A's and B's ok some people might take me the medic as unimportant, but i tell you one thin at that training i showed how inportant i was, a lot of them had leg cram and i treated my casualties with a lot of care ok!!! i even went up to get beehoon and drink for him toe eat man, because there was free beehoon and i also wanted some, but that is not the point, treated him very good already ok!!!! also Our Log spec. i don't know how he sprain his ankle in the Log room ok, but i had to run and treat him and i even went and stayed in the room to look after him even though i wanted to slack in there, but again that was not the point, but the most worst of all injuries was when a Part A cut his to on the drain while he was playing soccer bare feet, i had to go treat it, the flesh of the bottom part of his toe was cut, it was still hanging there man, i checked my manual and this type of injury is called an avusion, a lot of people cannot stand me and the way i treat his toes, as i took water and wash his toes, then using some cotton biud i wipe of some of the blood, then i took the twizers and i unflap the piece of flesh, a lot of them seeing me could not stand it, they all looked at it and were dam disgusted i tell ya don't know what is so scared about it man all were just a bunch of soft people, i did that as i had to open it and clean it with water then kill the bacteria with a alcohol prep pad or i might have an infection. then after that i took the oxide spray and pray it on the unflap flesh in order to clog the blood then i put a plaster on him. that is why i am important, if i was not there nows what will happen to all these casualties, depend on colin chis, oh please!!!! at the end of the day i had a sense of satisfactory i had done my job!!!! ok so i went home feeling very tired, so i slept after my lunch until i had to go for cath. class, i was still dam tired, but i had no choice, so i went to cath. class and uncle james was back, the lesson was dam boring, but uncle james told us he was sufferring from some kind of dieseas, he never told us, it maybe could be cancer. ok so after cath. class, we went out to get a bus to my house, so it was sam, ade, justin, ben, gerard and tham followed, well ben's dad told us the fire station was on fire and it was pretty ironic man, i mean a FIRE STATION ON FIRE WHAT THE HELL MAN!!!!!! so we found out the road was closed and that no bus could access the road from st.mikes, so they had a idea that we walk to my house, but i warned them it was dam far, but they said never mind, i can tell you the fire station on fire incidenti tell ya pretty ironic as we had to walk pass it to get to my house and the road was really closed until i could walk in the middle of the road and no car will bang me, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD!!!!!!!!! pretty ironic huh. So they finally arrived at my house and started raiding it, should have saw the reaction on my mothers face when i said the fire station was on fire hahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!! ok so all my friends eventually arrived, but both sides did not want to mix with each other, sam told me she was afraid of mixing because she was afraid they would think she was flirt????? but paul was dam shocked when he saw ade and sam, dunno why though?????? ok they enjoyed the food, but the best part i think eveyone enjoyed was when they grabbed me and threw me to the pool!!! but they threw me to the pool 2 times ok first was they grabbed me and threw me, the second time was when justin or ben push me in hahahahahaha!!!!! dam wet, then took pictures also another funny thing was when they were telling ghost stories,so i went to scare sam, she scream dam loud until i nearly deaf man, also she wanted to whack me 15 times!!!! god!!! dam pain, whack until dam hard man!!!! hahahahaha but i don't know why everybody say i am rich, i don't know why though everybody say i am rich when i am not!!!!! good god!!! so after the party i went to see everybody off and went to clear the place up before going back, shower then open my presents, thanking all the people who bought me a present!!!! so the next day i skip the GOH training, today well Koh Yew Kiat told us tommorrow he going reservist, YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so happy!!!! don't need to look at his face for 3 weeks!!!! ok today yoko ask me why me and sherman keep on fighting, i told him the reason, yoko heard it he dam angry man the main thing that pissed him off when i told him that sherman said that god and jesus did not exist so why waste our time going to church!!! wah i tell you a lot of people dam pissed when they heard that yoko told benedict, benedict was also not ahppy about it man, i tell ya sherman is near a thin red line in our class, he bigshotness and disrespectfulness for people is going to get him into trouble. ok ya know where i am typing me blog right now, not at home but at willy's house hahahahahaha, i don't know what happen to CJ, the last i heard she told me that she maybe had dengue fever, don't know whether she is in hospital right now, if she is, i am gonna pay her a visit, considering the fact that she will be dam bored in the hospital, if she ended up there hahahahahahahahaha, ok now i need to end here so bye then!!!

I ONE DAY AM GONNA WHACK HIM SO DAM BAD MAN I TELL YOU WHEN I CANNOT CONTROL MYSELF ANYMORE. SO THIS IS A FINAL WARNING SHERMAN LOW CHER NGUAN, ONE MORE TIME OF YOUR DISRESPECTFULNESS YOU WILL GET IT FROM ME!!!!!!!!!! ok now on what happen today, well at school we had PE and dinesh was forced to do push ups so sad, hahahahahaha then darren chow shouted to DK "racist ah", but in the end ryan cheog to the rap, stupid cowardly darren chow,me willy and edwin as usual walk all the way during the run, didn't bother about anything, just walked and talk at the same time who cares!!! ok the bottom part will be for the people whom are invited to my birthday party, does not invited, don't bother to read!!!                       Minor change in day of party       I change the day of the party to satuerday because not many people can make it on friday, people from my cath. class we skip mass and straight away from church go to my house and party, to my school friends if you know where is my house go there yourself i will meet you all there, may my 15th birthday be a memoriable one!!!!!!!!!
