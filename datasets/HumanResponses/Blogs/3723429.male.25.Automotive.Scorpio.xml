      in a guys world, being laid at the age of 14 is a somewhat rare occurance.  //[lets add some spice...]  being laid at the age of 14 by a 23 year old woman (5'9, 110 lbs.).... thats ultra rare. in fact it is considered taboo (no duh!).  //[now add some msg....]  at the age of 14, being laid by a 23 year old woman... who is a... school teacher...  //[it doesnt stop there....]  at the age of 14, being laid by a 23 yeard old woman who is a school teacher and who has a husband... (who cannot perform up to expectations - by what this report mentioned)  http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0628042teach1.html

      happyhooking.blogspot.com  she is a very good writer! on her post today - she explains how many books she's read since 4. since then - laura comes up with the "conservative number" of 3,000.  //[in other news...]  my tongue still aches from last sunday's event (see below!). yesterday i felt so groggy =P. yet i thought i was about to *yak* @ work in my recycling bin (someone took my trashcan!). it was probably this drink that was similar to NO FEAR/RED BULL/ ETC. the amount of servings this can had is 3... THREE! either way - it was cheap (2.50 vs. 5.50 NO FEAR)- i may have gotten sick from that (too much caffeine).  but today - i won some padre tickets. although not too excited - i may give them away. i used to be a baseball fan when i was young but there was football.  //[san diego and the june gloom...]  yes folks! san diego, during the summer, is gloomy in june. clouds populate the sky as if they too were on vacation. it feels like washington but without the cold air. washington, during the summer, is the opposite of the 3/4 of gloom washington state has to offer during the rest of the year (yes i did live there). washington state is the most beautiful it can be during this time of year (other than fluffy white powdery snow - which leads to snowboarding.. which leads to beautiful runs!). the sun is out - its not hot nor humid like a sauna but just right.

      well - the default settings for this blogger is "alright". first step - change the color. we'll see how it goes for the next couple of weeks. if i continue to post more - more changes and if i post less - glad i didnt spend an exuberant amount of time.  //[as for the weekend] we all take "short vacations" and by what i meant by "short vacations" is:  having the most fun in the shortest amount of time (before monday).  so what did i do? well - i went to a "rave". the one in particular is called "electric daisy carnival". if you are asking the following:  1) did i roll? (aka - e, pills, extacy, etc...)? yes!  2) did i dance lavishly and was promiscuous with the women there? cant say that i havent =P  3) how many bottles of water? about 7.  4) other than dropping e? weed.  5) is this an every month occurance? no.  for those who think i am an addict of some sort... you are in error! extacy - ill take once a year at the most (and this was my first for this year). i refuse to do any more than 1 for numerous amounts of reason. as for weed - i dont mind doing that every 2-3+ months.  why did i do it? i couldnt take a long vacation. I needed some relief in a short amount of time due to the fact - i am one of those who dont like there job! computer graphics - i cherish the thought, but the economy (in my area) is not too graphics friendly.  yes - i had a good time. lots of weirdo's (aka - candy kids, club kids.. etc), others of the rave culture, normal 20+ year olds and suprisingly - even adults 40+! quite the astonishment to see even the older generations wanting to get away from reality.  //[well..] edc (electric daisy carnival), seemed quite the reality escape i needed (as much as everyone else needed). the event hosted a number of top notch DJ's. the highlight of the night was the DJ who was playing @ the house area and Chistopher Lawrence (a good set finally!).  //[see ya later!]

      as i'm scouring the plains of endless blogs, i finally come across some that i can truely consider very interesting:  //[life as a video store clerk] this is about a girl who works at a video store and sells porn. it's not her avenue of expertise to sit behind a counter and watch people make there selections.... but she does take into account certain situations and certain customers. she documents them in a way that is tangible to the reader (including myself!). for example - she talks about some customers that return a video tape but have...(trace evidence if body fluid - egad!)and the use of anti bacterial gel to protect her from "dirty hands". very funny writing!  //[my secret life as a prostitute.] i absolutely love the journalism in this blog (which is now down under since June 28th). of course its about a hooker (but not just an ordinary one but rather in incognito). she has a real job and as a hobby - a hooker. Rather than just tell what this blog is all about - i suggest to rather read it yourself (if it ever comes back up!)! laura (author of happyhooking.blogspot.com) has a very intelligent approach when writing about her situations hooking /w guys. honestly, laura can be a very good writer if she really wanted to. up until yesterday, she has religiously updated it everyday.  it maybe that i am [perverted] but rather intrigued about what these women had to write, how they wrote it, and how they transpired thoughts into very tangible, if not amazing, pieces of work.

      //[a matrix of personalities]  blogger is quite the massively-online-mega-diary available to the public. lots of people's thoughts go in to these entries (including myself). so i ask - of those who write entries.... who get comments... do we seek comments from other people? are we searching for interaction? well - i do! just to sit here and type will get monotonus and eventually lead to the death of this blogger. interaction breathes many reactions but ultimately - some has responded to the likes of ones ideals, values, sympathy... etc. and so some bloggers continue to type away making it more interesting to do so because someone has found them to be of intrigue.  some interesting bloggers i found last night:  -lots of international diaries -a just beginning pr0n(porn) star starlet -school/college functions -a person in europe who listen to gabriel and dresden sets on a daily basis and likes to use obcenities in every sentence.  of these that i saw - the pr0n star one was quite interesting. she is living in los angeles and she is trying to get into the mainstream portion of the industry. girl/girl scenes seem to give her the rush she seeks but she is also willing to do boy/girl scenes. lots of detail and inner thoughts she has to offer. the mind of a pr0n star.  off to work =P

      //[a brief intro..]  alt[255] is actually an ASCII character that is blank but it has a byte to it (sounds oxy moronish). try pressing alt and 255 (number pad) and youll see a blank character come up. it may seem like a space but its rather identical to a tab.  //[anywho....]  i have never documented anything in my life until now... at this moment (of the post) im dead bored. the idea of blogger came from google (the search engine that aids humanity but can also be a abused like.... gmail - the email that is also searchable by google).  //[currently...]  confined to my room because of economical needs (like stupid gas prices being 2.20+!!!). if america had adopted some type of mass transportation system like... bullet trains (europe/japan) life could very well be:  a. faster than a car... with some walking (get some excercise!!) b. less pollutiion (of course...) c. skip the traffic! (wasting time on a freeway not moving is not my idea using time efficiently) d. etc etc etc (and many more reasons why mass transportation is a great idea!)  i am also confined to my room because of my roommate. why? long story short.  well first of all he has been a friend of mine since highschool. every since in highschool he has never admitted fault and has never been sorry (and doesnt even say hes sorry!). of course when he is Dr. Jekell - he a really good friend. but when he is Mr. Hyde - he is explosive in all types of negative mood swings =P  fast forward on to this month - he asks me to help his friend move out of the city. he calls me early morning but its a saturday for godsakes. he leaves a msg. i check voicemail!!! im willing to help - just give me another hour to enjoy sleep! an hour goes by, i wake up, take shower, he gets home to meet up with another friend, i get dressed. then....  "Where do you think your going?" "To help you." "Well how come you didn't call me back?" "I was sleeping, I got your msg and I was about to call you when I got ready." "Well, I dont need your help."  he proceeds to walk out. completely ruining a saturday with his "Pretentiousness" complex.   of course he has had a history of doing this and im just tired of it! i'll admit when i f*ck up - i'll be reasonable to admit "hey its my fault - im sorry!". but with him - its a different matter. he will never ever - in the 11 years i have been friends with him - say hes sorry.  although we live in the same apartment - i havent seen him for 2 weeks. a dose of his negativity is like bacardi 151. im fed up - he needs to admit that his actions were uncalled for!  //[in conclusion]  its rediculous how some people can never confess to admitting fault. im guilty of that too but hey - i have learned to correct my mistakes. recognize, realize and reform!  //[so what now...] go sleep and wake up to a job that is.... well you get the picture!

      Something about me that I havent mentioned on blogger is about my ability to learn and adapt fast, which leads to me having a career crisis. Basically, I lost my career goal.  //[Sad by true]  I never, ever had the idea I would be doing account exec. work (sales and marketing) and thrive doing it. And now i'm thinking about going back to college to get a degree in business and administration?  I hate office work. I hate office work. I hate office work. I hate office work.  //[Office Space]  Yes, most days it seems like there is no end to my question. I've always had the desire of being in media arts (Graphics and such). No matter how less I think about drawing, doodling and etc.... my mind wanders off into an abyss of... artistic wonder.  Specifically, I get bored easily. Office work is boring. I am not challenged. I seek challenge and sometimes create challenges to rid my mind of boredom.  My other talent is computers. Yes - I am a computer geek (but undercover). Computers will continue to evolve and therefore I like learning about them because its a challenge. Enough (I feel geeky)! This job that I have gives me challenges by learning databases and daily IT issues that come in the companies way. It keeps me "occupied".  Doing something artistic and problem solving is leading me to strive to do something ultimate. Something along the lines of.... video gaming. How does this work you may ask? Artisans come up with all sorts of ideas and with those ideas come problems. I solve problems I create from my ideas when I do 3D graphics (try saying that 10+ times). Being in constant thought of trying to solve problems that are perplexing leaves me to wonder and search throughout the day. My feelings keep me engulfed in a sea of artistic ideas with problems being as numerous as visible stars in the night sky.

      Friday, Saturday, Sunday..... party! Of course there is Monday (recovery day).  //[Friday] - Went to Sinbad's in PB. The Hukkah's were blazing in all the glory of getting "Legally High". Met 2 ladies - one is in fashion school, the other doing liberal studies @ UC Davis. Both latina women (spanish) and very adorable.  Foreshadowing my evening, I ate chinese food, which led to my condition of being dizzy and just about border line dizzy from a hukkah! So I layoff on the hukkah and enjoy the rest of the night in intelligent conversation with the 2 ladies.  //[Saturday] - Went to E-Street Alley - a nice, lowkey club - 21+. Let me tell ya.. crowded. Had lots of fun however the parking was horrendous! Nothing else to explain here other than dance and mingle with the ladies =).  //[Sunday] - I got invited to a friend's house in Fallbrook. Amidst the mountainous terrain sits a house on top of a hill overlooking the valley in all its glory. "A view to die for!", my motto everytime I visit his house. Upon my arrival, I am pleased to see all my friends having fun. A keg of San Diego's finest beer - Stone (Particularly Arrogant Bastard) set the night off with the finest weather San Diego can offer. But suddenly...  A friend of mine bought over some vodka and redbull. The combination of the 2 pair up fine:  Vodka - for that "kick" you will feel. RedBull - covers the taste of vodka no matter how much vodka you put! Plus the effect of energy.  Made the first mix, felt great. But the 2nd mix brings chaos. One of my other friends happenend to put a little more vodka than I had originally put and since Red Bull masks the vodka.. I dont need to explain! He literally put half a cup of vodka and 2 red bulls. After I had finished the cup - I blacked out.  The sound of a car starts. I awake. My surroundings - in my truck. The skies - sun down. My mind - asking myself 50+ questions on how I had arrived here.  I walked back to rejoin the party. To my amasement, my friends told me I walked over to the truck myself and passed out. But what they didn't tell me was I had thrown up next to my truck and my door handle (YUCK!) - I had found this out myself. At least I didnt vomit in my truck... that woulda been 10 times worse!  Great - I didnt feel any worse other than having a nap. The night was young. Finish the night off in the jacuzzi, eat and go sleep!
