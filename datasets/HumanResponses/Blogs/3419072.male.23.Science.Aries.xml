      Dear Green,  The days are gettting better now.I am more used to waking up early in the morning and staying throughout the afternoon, "looking" after my home. Watching the workers work gets me thinking that they are more tired than me and I am complaining that I need to bear the dust and the boredom for the next few weeks last few days ago.And most of the time I am spenting it behind the computer and books. I can't help it, can't I. Maybe I am just born of a nagger brain. Tomorrow, I will be going for the Talk on suicide at Awareness Place. Why do people want to commit suicide? Is there such a self destruction part in our brain that prompts us to do the unthinkable- Killing ourself,and causes pain and suffering to those whom we love so dearly? I am not too sure about it too. But i have seen a few death from the last few months to arrive at a reasonable conclusion.  Anita Mui, Zhang Guorong and Roman are all famous actors and singers. Their death brought about media frenzy and speculations of the underlying reason behind their deaths. Yet each has different outlook of life, thus their decision differ. Anita Mui seeks treatment at the later stage of the cancer. Zhang Guorong jumps from a building to his death after struggling with his depression for some time. Roman just died naturally even after undergoing treatment. Maybe Roman has a better outlook. I am not sure of the reports of his illness. At least I know that he is willing to go for treatment to save his life. That is the wisest choice.  Now I better get on to do a write up for Chun Kit for the LOW.Hopefully I get it done sooner or else Chun Kit will sure to kill me. Will he?  With Love Alex

      Dear Green,  New star on the block......Just want to share with U. Enjoy the music. This is the first time I heard such "Buddhistic" song on the radio. This is hit song from his album.There is even part of the heart sutra at the back which is rapped by him  寺庙  曲：张峰奇 | 词：张峰奇 | 编：   * 深山有一块圣地 是修行的静土 里面住着出家人 众生在里面修行 参访的居士里头 和那路过的过路人 见到庄严的寺庙 恭敬顶礼拜佛脚 里面没有任何的烦恼 没有愚痴的困扰 精进用功修行不停 别问到底行不行  # 清静的佛堂 庄严的法相 精进用功修行不停 看着佛像心生恭敬 想一想我是该修行 清静的佛堂 庄严的法相 精进用功修行不停 只要虔诚的向佛顶礼 就能还我 清静  Repeat * #  《般若波罗密多心经》 观自在菩萨 行深般若波罗蜜多时 照见五蕴皆空 度一切苦厄 舍利子 色不异空 空不异色 色即是空 空即是色 受想行识亦复如是 舍利子 是诸法空相 不生不灭 不垢不净 不增不减 是故空中 无色  Love  Alex

      Hair No more 7:11 p.m. 2003-11-22  Today I did something brave.Brave could be a overstatement. But then I am happy that I did it. I am balding and once i did say that if I am bald I am sure to cut away all my hair. Easy said than done.I refuse to do for three years till today. I cannot face myself in the mirror trying to cover the bald area with hairs growing healhy at my back. So I said Good bye to my hair today.It is also a way to regain my confidence as a person.But I see a first step not a last one. I bound to feel affected by what people say about haircut.So that is it.Today studies are so laborious and slow. I manage to study one topic in the morning and afternoon after trying to wake up in the early morning. So slow......Haiz I think I better buck up now or else the grades will be like a constipated feces on my face.YUcks. See U soon. Alex  2003-11-20 6:53 p.m. Dear Green,  Life is always in a state of influx.....impermance is always there   Alex

      Dear Green,  Thanks for lending me your listening year. Yesterday, I found a friend of yours. His name is called Blue. It has some entries from one year back. It kept me accompany when you are away for your long holiday.I never did called Blue Blue but with the numbering system of article one, two and so for. Yet Blue needs to be more personalised, more humanised like U, Green. Besides, after being with me for a long time, you should know that maybe some of my complaints are due to my oversensitivity on my part. So you may get bored or irritated by it.So Blue can act as a buffer for you.   Greem.....one of my friend, Gordon read my entries and noticed that there is a error in your name.   I could have done two things:  1)With my ignorance and arrogance, I refused to accept it as a mistake. I would rather make an another mistake to cover this error of mine. Maybe i opt to call you grimy green. Saying I add the "m" for a reason.  2) Admit it as a mistake.  I choose the later but with a reason attached of course. People do make mistakes and that are sometimes unavoidable. We are NOT as enlightened as the Buddha, our teacher, who is capable to see the cause and effect for every phenomeno in every situation. What I can do is to realise my mistake once it is taken noticed by someone. This, thus, may enhance my learning to be a better person.  These are some of the entries I have taken from easyjournal.  30.4.2004 // The countdown Posted at 3:21 AM  Dear Green,   It is now 2am. The date is 1st May 1, 2004. Labor Day.   I am trying to sleep at around 1am after watching one of favorite show, Emperor Kang Xi.  I believe not many people will want to watch this show. The only person I know who watches this show is Jun Jun. I met her on Monday to get some posters on “Sounds of the Human World' Buddhist Hymns Songwriting Contest” by Fo Guang Yuan. The date has been extended to the 16th May 2004. Lyrics are provided. There is some monetary return if your song has been chosen. This is the link: http://www.blia.org.sg/Poster/P4.html.if you are interested, please take a look. That was five days ago.  Tired….  Alex    30.4.2004 // Continue...... Posted at 1:12 PM   In less than a day, I have written to you twice. Maybe I start to pick up the momentum to have more entries in the journal after the first one at 3am. Last five days ago, besides meeting Jun Jun to collect some posters, I went to job hunting with a friend around the Bugis area. As the interview starts only at 2 pm, we went to the nearby Pasa malam to window shop. I come to notice two shops that had escaped my attention when I previously walk through after praying at the temple nearby. The air-conditioned second floor of the shop houses sold mainly the young girls stuffs. And a Tibetan shop that sold Buddhist Artifacts.   I am thinking of getting a Thangka (http://www.buddhanet.net/thangkas.htm) for my room. Maybe it is for both the aesthetic and religious reasons that I wish to have one. Thangka has fascinated me recently. The interest grew as I read more on the subject from a book borrowed from the NUSBS Library (Images of Enlightenment by Jonathan Landaw and Any Weber).   Now this is my next aim: to get Thangka since I have gotten my prayer wheel from the 25th Management Committee and of course there is the two CDs.   A big Thank you again to them……if they are reading this.   Last four days ago, I went to watch a movie with Gillian, Weiyang, Darren, Chun kit, Pearlyn and Siling at 4pm. The movie is “ Into the mirror”. I am not very fond of sacred movies. They just frightened me and I would lost sleep after this. But there is some part of me who wanted to watch it…….Don’t u get that kind of Feeling, Green. I did watch the movie without closing my eyes and ears. The movie is not as scary as I thought it would be. On the other hand I am more concerned about Chun Kit scaring me as he is sitting right behind me. Fortunately nothing has happened. But I still believe that I would have screamed if someone have tapped on my shoulders . Scary   The plot of the movie is good if Green will to ask me. Very convoluted and thought-provoking.   There is a second movie I watched in this week. Guess what is the movie called.   Hint:   I looked at you baby  And what did I see  I saw love in your eyes  Made me feel so warm inside   Now look at me baby  And what do you see  You see love in my eyes  Gleaming just for you   And now we know it's  Time to get alone  To get alone  And just be together  We'll only be together   Come and do a couple days  Just a ways  Away from the people  And safe from the people   The pine-scented air  Smells so good in the snow  In our toboggan we'll go  Screaming down the mountainside   The touch of your cheeks  When they're rosy and cold  Feels so cozy to hold  Just to take you close  And make you warm and   Time to get alone  To get alone  And just be together  We'll only be together   Come and do a couple days  Just a ways  Away from the people  And safe from the people   Lyin' down on our backs  Lookin' at the sky  Looking down through the valley so  Deep and wide   Aren't you glad we finally got away  Glad we finally got away  Aren't you glad we finally got away   Now I looked around baby  And what do I see  I see love in your eyes  And I'm so glad that we  Finally had some   Time to get alone  To get alone  And just be together  We'll only be together   Come and do a couple days  Just a ways  Away from the people  And safe from the people   With Love  Alex    17.5.2004 // Quan Yin and the renovations Posted at 5:08 PM   Dear Green,   I am back for good for now. It has been a wonderful experience that I can only say it is Chinese to U. 法喜充满.After I have been back home, my HDB flat is now undergoing a major renovation. The Kitchen and the two toilets ( common toilet in the kitchen and the master's bedroom toilet are now in the midst of getting a face lift. Now the whole home is covered with a thick layer of dust and sand.And when U walk on the floor, it just give a smooth and uncomfortable feeling.My face is also not spared from the agony too. Sand on the face. Free Facial. If u want it, I beg u to come. At least I am save from such suffering.  This whole renovation is going to take about three weeks. That is long,man if a person thinks it negatively.  Ok lah  i will write to u later.  With Love  Alex    20.5.2004 // Results............... Posted at 10:32 AM   Dear Green,   What can I say now?  My results are the cause of my idleness and complacacy.  Yesterday night, I checked my Second Semester Results. This is after some friends "forced" me to do it. I didn't want to do it because I want to prolong my carefree and happy state.  Am I wrong to do?  Not sure.  Yes, because I am deluding myself. Sooner or later I am going to know my results.  No,because I will be happy.....only for the moment. That is ok right.  My results are terrible.  Maybe not so bad if u deem bad as having failed grades.  But my CAP drops and it continues in that way for the last 3 semesters.  Maybe I have too expectation of myself,  Comparing myself to those high flyers surrounding me.  What will I do now, Green?  I think I have to focus and study hard for the next four semesters.  i can 't afford to allow my CAP to drop any further.  The reprecussions is ......  I am not at all intelligent just hardworking.  Peace  Alex    23.5.2004 // Vincent....E-mail.  Posted at 5:11 PM   Dear Green,   As you do not have access to my mailbox, I have send this e-mail by one of my friend called Vincent.  Allow your mind to ponder.   Hi,   I very much agree with David on it, all talk and no practice comes to naught in Buddhism. The debate on hinayana, mahayana has been around for two thousands years already. Discussing it won't make it any more right or any more wrong. But it does broaden our knowledge on the  history of Buddhism. The other much talk-issue since the Buddha's nirvana is the precepts (monks accepting money in violation of precepts? Is there really bodhisattva precepts? and so on)   Highly accomplished masters, arahants or even bodhisattvas (if we know who they are) will encourage others to practice and living out the Dharma in life instead of preaching mahayana, hinayana concepts. Read the biography of the great teachers of Thailand, Tibet and China  and we will truly feel how close the Dharma is to our life. The great compassion exhibit by the teachers is really touching and worthy of our learning.   The crux of the mahayana is the love on sharing the Dharma with others, hoping they will be free from samsara. Worthy of such praise in modern days are the committee members in buddhist organisations, volunteers, teachers who share their time and effort to bring Buddhism to many. We may have abundant knowledge of Buddhism, but when it comes to simple things like lending a helping hand in Dharma  propagation and outreach, can we apply the things we have learnt?   Vesak Day is coming soon in Singapore and most Buddhism-related emails I have received are mostly calls for helpers. The NUS Buddhist Society is also having their freshman orientation camp and outreach projects for the coming term. Many of them are at the forefront sharing the Dharma with others and through it, they also experience  the importance of Dharma in their lives. Their actions truly reflect the spirit of praise-worthy Buddhists. So are we theoretical (academic) buddhists or the true disciples of the Buddha?   Vincent   With Love  Alex    Meditative Love Alex

      Dear Green,  I have decided to move you here because I think that easyjournal is becoming a bit commercial. I just cannot upload the photos i want you to see. This is causing me some frustrations so I make a difficult decision to make this your home for a third time around. The first one is easyjournal, the second is diaryland and hopefully this is the last one. i believe that you are as adaptive to changing environment though i cannot say much for myself. I am not a person who gets comfortable quickly in my surroundings and the people around. I take more time. These are the few entries from your previous homes.  1)8.1.2004 // 1st Time or Last time Posted at 12:28 AM   Dear Green,   This is my first time writing in this journal.Hopefully it won't be the last. Previously I have a few: a thick notebook which I called Green as the cover is green in color, a stack of papers written my dreams and goals for that semester and the one in diaryland. Whenever I write something in the diary there is always the feelings of confusion and depression as though i am the only one left in this world and the only way to pour out my sorrow is to write. Writing has its therapeutic effect on me besides helping me to organise my messy thoughts and my life and of course going to those unpleasant moments in my life.However this time round, i do not have these feeling in me.  With every beginning there is always a ending. My favourite Buddhist characeteristic of the life and the world at large-impermance. After some times, I stop writing. Why? Procracination, sick and tired, and no time.  Will I stop at this page of the journal. I really do not know. Only time will tell.   From  Alex

      This is written especially to those who are reading my blog. Green is no where to be seen. Maybe she/he/it is too shy to appear after making his debut appearance. Life is a bit tough for Green as she/he/it does not have a physical form to take up to. Neither he has the power to choose from the situation he is in. My friend, Chun Ser come to my home the last few days. He is an understanding and encouraging person to be with. He is indeed an inspiration for me to continue to blog if time and place allow me to carry on this new hobby of mine. I first got interested in blogging when I started to realise that it may be helpful to find for answers on some pending questions in my life. Writing helps you to organise your thoughts so that you can better focus on the solution which is there but needs to be discovered. In this way I feel that blogging is done not because I want people to read my blog but to find it as a joy or frustration place or thinking of a solution( This is akin to Ancient Greeks who walk around in circles, searching for answers.

      Dear Green and Katrine,  Green, there is a friend from NUSBS that will be joining us for this session of complaints and learning. Her name is katrine.....(Hi Katrine). It is a pity that I do not have her photo to show it to you. You need to base on your imaginations on how she looks like. Hopefully she reads this blog and if she does not,then Green will be unable to know her personally except through me. This is how things work here in the land of blog where things come alive when people makes them as real as the life they are leading in. The Land of Blog is like any other worlds......the middle earth......it is only able to keep its own existence by breathing in the life of others. If not, it cease to exist. Ok that is enough of blogger land. You need to discover blogger land yourself.  Humans have the weirdest and wildest imaginations and all these come alive when u r in blogger land. Ok, Am I boring U, Green. (No, not actually except that......it is damned boring. I know the place i am staying in so there is no need to give so much details. If there is so much, people may get bored and stopped reading blog and I may disappear soon....................) There is a talk that I went to two weeks back at Awareness Place at Bras Basah Complex. It is organised by Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery.  The topic is on Suicide:Resignation, Protest Or Problem Solving. The details are as followed (Boring): Sociological 1) Altruistic- This means that we kill ourselves so that others can live such as in the military. 2) Egoistic- As in the recent mother and child incident, there is too pain for the mother so she opt to kill herself. 3) Anomic- There is loss of social continuation. This means a disruption in the social routine. This can also be a rightful place the person stands in the society. 4)Fatalistic- A rigid and traditional system where the people such as widow and slave are being forced to comply to certain unfair rules.  This is one of the quote the Speaker,Dr Lim Kok Kwang gives during the talk. I am not sure whether I get it fully. It is something like that " People are still living because of two reasons. The first one is living because you are not dead and the second one is you are not dying"  I understand by the second one is that you have a higher purpose to live for so you do not think of dying.  I need to take a break first......feeling a bit tired or maybe lazy....will be writing later......  Peace Alex

      Dear Green,  There' s so much for me to do. But then does it really matter whether I do them. I am not sure of it too. I am, as my friend, Pang who makes a reference to the fly without any head. The flies just fly about, knocking their heads on things. Haiz. Maybe i should try to take thing one step at a time. It is much safer this way.  Peace Alex

      Dear Green,  Time is not at my side. There seems to be so much unfinished work in my life. I am not sure what to do about them. When I set up my mind to do them, there is always procrastination coming along the way. I cannot say that it is entirely the fault of procrastination as I create it; for it to obstruct my progress in life. Or is it to block off any prospects of successes. Still remember last tuesday, I am nearly ticked off my KP for being late for my Buddhist class. He is finding hard to believe that I can be late for two times or maybe three times consecutively. He mentioned that I am not putting enough effort in it. Maybe that is why I am always late. Being late means a few things to me, as I recently find out,number one is that I am late because of some pending and important stuffs to do.This could be procrastination at work. Or I am forced to do what I am supposed to do--- Living a politically correct world.   Have to end here or i will be late for dytc  Alex

       Dear Green,    &nbsp;  Today is my off day from work. Actually I have planned on what to do today. I was supposed to have a gym session with a friend, L. And I was thinking of going for a meeting with the SIF overseas organisers. In the end, these two plans did not actually happen, I have instead something better. I was out with a friend, E. E is my secondary Two friend and he is the one I know and have kept contact . To be&nbsp;exact,&nbsp;we have known each other for 10 years. Wow that is long.    We have breakfast at the hawker centre&nbsp;just&nbsp;in front of &nbsp;Hougang Heartland Mall. Afterward, we went to my workplace to&nbsp; buy medications for his trip back to Australia. E is studying there and will be leaving tomorrow morning. I wonder when will he be back. He said in November. And I know I will be missing him. This outing is never meant to be just an meeting. He called me yesterday to ask me to help him to buy medications for him. I agreed. So i asked to meet him at 1030 at Heartland Mall. As usual I was late.   When we are at the pharmacy, I urge him to dye his hair and after much persuasions&nbsp;he did it at the saloon near my home.    Just as I expected, E looks like a changed man. Mature and more pleasant looking.    He was very worried what his parents will say.   I hope they will not say that Alex is a bad influence.   Hopefully.   I do admire those people who can dye their hair.   Maybe it is jealous.   Now that I am balding.I cannot do these anymore without looking more werid.    I do regret I did not comb my hair as often in secondary school when I got a chance.   I do not think that it is vanity.   Vanity is more of a egocentricity.   And looking good is not only for yourself but for others too.   Hope to see u soon E  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Peace   Alex    &nbsp;

      Yes.  In Green world, Green has problems. So does his friend. Problems which are probably similar we see everyday. One of them that Green highlights to me is something I can't really help "him" In "his" world, Sexuality is never a issue.But it becomes a issue in this world I am living in.  If I will put Green as a his, people may have the wrong preception that Green is a male.  Yet Green is not female. And there is no combination of gender.  In the Green world, the concepts of sexuality is something we cannot know. This is because we are so attuned to our own surroundings and knowledge of this world that we use them in "their" world. And this does not exactly explain what is happeining there. Anyway Green's friend problem is that  When both man and female are in love with one other in the real world as in ours, do u really need to have the sexual intention to make the relationship work as in becoming married? Is having sex a extension of marriage? I wonder together with Green ( Green is very proficient on life in this world) Yet there is no solution. Is there???  Peace Alex

      Dear Green,  I am sick. I am not feigning sick. But I am really sick. Eversince I started work, I have this unexplained gastric pain with excess belching and hunger pangs. The weird thing is that all these symptoms appear after I have eaten a meal. The doctor from School said that i should take small meals. Ok I have not done that. Now it has become somewhat worse. So I try not to drink and indulge in my favourite hobby- coffee drinking. And it works. But then I will be missing that cup of daily dose.  Then again the benefit is that i can get whiter teeth. Hopefully. Yes another illness is my sprained ankle that become sprained since I started my intern at Guardian. I am uncertain how I sprained it. I am aware that it is a relapse of an old injury I have when i was in Secondary Three. Now that it has become worse that I can no longer run. The hope of me running for the Army Half Marathon this year becomes somewhat bleak. Not only that I am also getting fatter by the minisecond. Yes from the start of this journal I have gained enough fat to last me for the next few months. Sad. How? It has been two weeks since the doctor says that I can recover by then. But the pain, though tolerable, still exists. The pain could be due to my prolonged standing at the pharmacy. What am I suppose to do? I can 't impossible sit on my job. Fortuately one more weeks this pain may soon cease as the internship is ending soon.  Peace Alex

      Yes I have this urge to write this essay or maybe it is a short writing whatever one may call as short.  Yes I am torn between the right and wrong that is perceived by the world at large I am torn between what is meant by natural beauty and comestic beauty. I am torn between the need to achieve worldly success and the want to fulfill one 's dreams.  Why? Isn't The Law of the World is as such that peace is always maintained and the Evil is alway punished. And noone will in the right state of mind to launch a war against any countries like Hilter or maybe Stalin. But then what we are seeing now is somehow very distorted, we are seeing that some countries are taking arms to fight for peace. War for peace.  That sounds so ironic, isn't it.  Yesterday night, I was watching a documentry by Gongli. She was asked what is in her beauty that attracted many. She answered that there is nothing special about her and she preferred natural beauty. Then something come into my mind. If the person  being interviewed is not Gongli but the infamous Albagil. Should she have said she preferred natural beauty. Won't that be a joke?  ........I have utilised all the energy.......to write  Alex

      Dear Green,  My holidays are soon coming to a close. There is so much to do that I fail to do during my holidays. Maybe I have much expectations of myself doing more work. I must really learn to let go. In less than a week, I will be going back to school and buried myself in books. The modules I am taking this semester are as follows  1)PR3102 DOSAGE FORM DESIGN III 2) PX3108  PATHOLOGY 3) PR3101  Principles of Medicinal Chemistry  4) PP2107  Pharmacology II (Systems Pharmacology) 5) GEM2005/HY2243  Film and History       Except for GEM 2005, I will be taking exams for the rest of the modules which requires the hard memorisation on my part. I really need to work hard to get into Second upper. I hope I can do it. No more heavy committments except for BS DC.      Now I am listening to Josh Groban first Album. So beautiful and this music has accompanied and supported me emotionally during my exam period last semester. And I only managed to get all Bs for the papers. Sad.       Seven days in Singapore.      I just want to write what I have been doing for the last seven days.   Just a reflection.   Just now I have written to KP about the suggestions on DC.    KP is my buddy in the Buddhist lesson at Sagaramudra Buddhist Society. This is its website     urlLink www.sagaramudra.org.sg .   Maybe I should start last monday. That is the day when I have my lunch with my mother. I treat her to a simple meal in a restuarant. But Ma does not seem to like the food.The food is too oily for her taste and I regret not telling her that. Maybe we should have dim sum as orginally planned.   Last tuesday, I went for my last Buddhist lesson for that term in the evening. There is four terms in a year for this three year Buddhist course. And that is the third one. I cannot imagine that I have studied for three term. Wow that is amazing. I can 't remember what I did in the morning.   Last wednesday..........I can't remember as of now. Ok yes i went to library to borrow books for my presentations in school. I taught my tuition in the evening for a hour.   Last thurday, I went for lunch with CS at Suntec. We have Teochow porridge. After which I went to teach tuition.   Last friday, I went to the matriculation fair to help out. There seems to be not many people on the last day. Someone told me that it is no longer compulsary to enter through the fair to get out of the SRC. Then I went to have lunch with FY, A and N. Later, N and I went to Geylang and I show him some of the temples. Buddhist Library is one of them. I need to go there as I need to borrow books for my presentation.    Last Saturaday, I have presentation on Death to the DYTC. It is very inorganised. Maybe I have been very lazy and did not make the necessary preparation. Hahahah. That 's me.    Last Sunday, I went market with Mother. In the afternoon I went out with S to the Esplanade to return and borrow CDs.    This Monday, I stay at home and taught tuition in the afternoon.   This Tuesday, I went for lunch with CS and I am supposed to teach tuition but the student change the timing last minute. So I stay at CS house for a while before departing for home.   This Wednesday, I went for the meeting for Welcome tea. Prior to that, I have a meeting with P as I need to settle the module with him. After the Welcome tea, we went to watch Spring Summer Autumn Winter with BS.   This Thursday, I went out with A and N to watch the movie The village. Great film. Then we went for Ajahn Brahm talk.    Now I am going to sleep      peace   Alex

      Dear Green,  Someone commented that I have been neglecting U. Do you think so? I mean won't u be happier when there is a person lesser to pour all the problems and complains to U. Do you feel this way? Sometimes I think that you are a difficult "person" to understand.  Since someone makes a remark such a remarks, I am quickly addressed the "problem" , right.  Jacqueline Du Pre died on the19th 1987 in London. She is a musician, a cellist to be exact. A good cellist. Still her talents, I feel, is not fully utilised because she suffers multiple sclerosis which causes her to have decreased nerve functioning, thus decreased coordination. I am listening to her recording when I am typing this journal entry.  I watch the movie, Hiliary and Jackie two times. It features the biography of Jacqueline Du Pre's life. I am not sure whether the movie indeed follows closely to her real life. But by watching the movie itself, I am sympathised with her tragic life. She is often misunderstood by others, especially her sister. Yet she herself has many presumptions about others. So this somehow makes her life difficult to live. She is tormented mentally. I feel that I am like her in a certain sense that I always have many assumptions about what others think about me. And sometimes I will act in the irrational way to fuel that wrong preception. I mean maybe I am too used to what I think may be correct though how wrong it may be, thus I will try to prove them to be truth. Is this ego?  Maybe so.  I have to go now Alex
