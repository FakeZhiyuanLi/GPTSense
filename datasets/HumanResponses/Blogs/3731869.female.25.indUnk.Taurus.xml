      The boys wakes at age 14, in this world that stood no longer familiar To this world of dishonest. As the boy grows more into the man he must be, he starts to wonder.. "who is that man I might be? Who is he? Will I ever find out?"  That day the boy, now a man will fear for the rest of his life. the day that all curiosity stops..... He starts to day dream..... Face to face with him, no longer can fear, no longer can run, this is that day!! He looks him in the eyes, Studies him head to toe, now wonder what his voice sounds like.The man now approaches the other with a soft introduction, the man says I have feared this day, as the other nods his head in agreement. The man continues, I have lived for this day, I have many memories that I would have like to share with you, but now I stand here many years after I awoke, waiting for this day. I now ask if you may be part of my future memories......The man turns and starts his walk down the white carpet...As he approaches the end he turns over his shoulder to see his father watching him begin his new life....

      Just a little day dream I have we walk along the beach holding hands smile far from fake with an honesty only dreamt. Talking past, present, and future.. Rolling around laughing were the water hits the sand, never knowing when night end and morning begins for eternity, feeling complete weather 2 feet or 2 miles apart having that eternal completeness....... And right past me you go, oh yeah remember I told you just a day dream, incomplete I'll await, soon I'll find my new 11:11

      Till this day I live for This day of happiness and completeness Till this day I live This day I no longer be alone Till this day I wait This day I conquer the world Till this day I dream This day I close my eyes and you watch me Till this day I don't even blink This day of happiness and completeness, dreams and trust Till this day I wait stand alone and dream with wide open eyes Till this day I live for

      Sadness turns into anger, misunderstood feeling as though I'm missing something not to happy with what I turned out to be, my so called life. But yet who ever is? Everyone always wants more then what they have, so how is complete happiness possible? I don't like what I turned to be, what sucks is that I tried to get here!? I think I might have been happy before, or was I just able to hide it better? At times I think I might be happy but yet unable to remember a night of pure happiness. But are you? So close but yet so far, I think I can feel you, can you feel me? Do you work from the outside in or inside out? Just asking cause I could put off a bad ora .. So sadness turns into anger, misunderstood turns into attack.  Just lost lost!!  Not to sure if I'm here or not, not to sure of where I'm going or where I've been. Tried to move on.. I thought I did. But no, I find myself in the same place..... IN THE ROUND ROOM.... now just different faces, and none seem to be smiling and it seems a bit darker, I guess when they say dreams come true, they left out day or night.. So should I try again,but what if it gets darker? If I except what I turned to be, would I conquer happiness? If able to except why have expectations!! I just want to wake is it just a thin layer between light and dark? where have all the smiles gone?  maybe I'm just up side down!???

      Chaos and disorder this shadow of life in which we live in. Chaos in which we bring upon ourselves, or we just can't change the disorder we were born with. time to short to decide what disorder we choose to live, care if anyone judges you? lay back your gonna die any way. or live up to everyone's expectations... but what are yours?

      Sleepless nights, horror dreams, when finally rested afraid to open my eyes, afraid to face the reality of chaos and disorder, which I find myself at. people same world, walk around with a smile ear to ear. I ask myself, do they see something I don't? Do they have something I don't? MAYBE I JUST SEE SOMETHING THEY DON'T.......

      CLOSE MY EYES FOR A MOMENT AND NOW THE MOMENT IS GONE.... you could think of a thousand moments, but if you could have held onto one what would it be... would you want to dream it forever or just cherish it for a day?

      walking down that street the first time, seeing that big house, seeing that yellow buggy in the drive way. You'll never see it like that again, the first time you see things they just seem so great, so unusual. then that big house just turns into that house, the buggy just turns into the car. I wonder if the house looked at me and said "who is that girl" and if so, does it now say "just that girl". I was just wondering....
