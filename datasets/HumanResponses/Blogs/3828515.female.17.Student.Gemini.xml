       Please excuse the long post; it's just that I am a little bit bored and feel like writing and rambling on and on. I didn't do much today except for wait in line at the DMV for about an hour and a half... But I got my actual plastic driver's license today, so that was good. My picture sucks, but there is no such thing as a decent picture of me anyways. Oh well. After arriving home, we had some food from Burger King for lunch, and I went outside to mow the lawn. It was a very nice day, a little breezy at times. Anyways, I actually watched TV tonight, which is something I almost never do. I watched the 2004 Nathan's hot dog eating contest on ESPN. That was both interesting and disturbing. I also watched this X-Games (blah) surf contest with Kelly Slater and Taj Burrow and Corey Lopez and some other awesome surfers; it was scored like a basketball game, but much more complexly, which was strange. I then proceeded to watch a rerun of the tennis match between Roddick and Kiefer because one can never get enough of Andy Roddick. So that was all.      Last song I listened to:   Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger  by Daft Punk.   Last album I listened to:   Discovery .   Last meal I ate:  A Whopper and fries from Burger King :P.   Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  Ugh... Band camp begins on Tuesday of next week.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  Don't know.   Last person I talked to:  Dan.   Favorite song today:   Clair De Lune  by Claude Debussy.   Favorite food today:  I don't know.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Got my driver's license.   Funniest thing that happened today:  I don't recall anything especially hilarious taking place today.

       Well, today was relatively boring. This morning, we took a ride back to Niagara Falls for breakfast and to look at the falls, I guess, again before we left. So yeah. Then we drove for pretty much the rest of the day and got home at about 9:15 tonight. The pictures I took in Canada should be posted on my profile by the time you read this, so feel free to check them out. &nbsp;    Last song I listened to:   Requiem  by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.    Last album I listened to:   Re-Load .    Last meal I ate:  A McChicken and some fries at McDonald's.    Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .

Last person I talked to:  Melissa.    Favorite song today:   Gone  by Ben Folds.    Favorite food today:  The home fries and sausages at the breakfast buffet we went to this morning were pretty good.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Came home!   Funniest thing that happened today:  Well my dog went insane when we walked in the door... That was entertaining.

       Well they call it one of the most beautiful towns on the North American continent. I wouldn't doubt it. If you love flowers, they are absolutely  everywhere  in Niagara-On-The-Lake. Anyways, we stayed in this town for quite a while and visited the lakefront, where the Ontario River and Lake Ontario meet, took a ride in a horsedrawn carriage through the town, and walked around for a bit downtown. It was very cool. After leaving Niagara-On-The-Lake, we went to the Niagara Parks Botanical Gardens and walked around. That was very cool. The plants and flowers are so much bigger and more colorful there than around here. I got a bunch of good pictures in the gardens if you're interested in looking at my albums on my profile. Anyways, after that we came back to our hotel room and headed back out to dinner at a place called Murphy's in the town we were staying in on the harbor. That was good food. Then we drove by the falls again when it was dark. They had lights projecting on them that looked pretty neat - the water droplets broke the white light into the spectrum. And the town of Niagara Falls is actually a pretty jumpin' place at night! So yeah. That was today. &nbsp;    Last song I listened to:   Master Of Puppets  by Metallica.    Last album I listened to:   S & M .    Last meal I ate:  Shrimp Tetrazini.    Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .    Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .    Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  They had a shop selling tiny model saxophones... Heheheh... I refrained from buying one, though.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  Don't know.    Last person I talked to:  Absolutely no one.    Favorite song today:   Jump In The Fire  by Metallica.    Favorite food today:  My shrimp tetrazini. :)    Most interesting thing I did today:  Walked around and took a carriage ride :P.    Funniest thing that happened today:  A family seated behind us at the restaurant in which we ate dinner had apparently sold their boat today, so they were celebrating... And they were all drunk as skunks. It was more annoying than funny, but funny nonetheless.

       Today was interesting after all, and the weather was relatively decent. We did end up going to Niagara Falls today, and there we went on a double-deck bus tour through the whole area and took a ride on a boat which takes you right up to the falls. We got kinda wet, so that was fun. I took a bunch of pictures that I will probably post on my blog/profile once I get home, if not a little sooner... Perhaps. Yeah. And we went out to dinner at what seemed to me a Canadian version of T.G.I. Friday's... Except for the fact that they had pictures of various celebrities all over the walls. We actually sat in a corner with Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston hanging on the walls... So that was... Interesting. Anyways, that's pretty much it. &nbsp;    Last song I listened to:   Master Of Puppets  by Metallica.    Last album I listened to:   S & M .    Last meal I ate:  Cajun chicken alfredo.    Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .    Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .    Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I do not know    Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  Don't know.    Last person I talked to:  Absolutely no one.    Favorite song today:   Jump In The Fire  by Metallica.    Favorite food today:  I'm not much of one for sweets, and I don't know exactly what it was, but it tasted like caramel ice cream. Ooooh, that was good :).    Most interesting thing I did today:  Went for a ride on a boat up to the base of the Niagara Falls.    Funniest thing that happened today:  In the restaurant where we sat in a corner booth with Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston hanging over our heads, a fly landed on Jennifer's forehead, and a mosquito landed on Brad's forehead. That was rich :P.

       Well, I am in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada, on my brother's PowerBook using the wireless Internet connection of a Holiday Inn. Woot. Anyways, today was just a driving day, basically... We spent pretty much the whole day in the car, and it was a pain, I guess. I probably listened to about eight CDs on the way. We also stopped at three McDonald's restaurants. That was insane. Anyways, the weather is kinda lousy up here... It's pretty foggy and rainy, so we'll see if we end up doing anything tonight. I might end up hitting the weight room or something stupid like that. &nbsp;     Last song I listened to:   Master Of Puppets  by Metallica.    Last album I listened to:   S & M .

       Yes. It's getting late, and we're leaving around 8:00 tomorrow morning, so I'd better get to bed at least relatively soon. I just thought that I would let you all know that I'll be blogging for the rest of the week in Canada, and I'll probably be online a little bit at night, too. &nbsp;     Last song I listened to:   Magic  by Ben Folds Five.

Funniest thing that happened today:  I read through some of David's old school assignments, like poetry books and the such. I hope he never pursues a career as a poet, and that is all I can say :P.

       That's right... It will be good to get out of Batavia, Illinois, for a few days. I still haven't done anything about the old CD player... We'll see about that later. Anyways, today I played these addictive little games we like to call  urlLink Yeti Sports . After a while, I went to play tennis for about two and a half hours (as usual), and that was about it. Oh yes, and we washed my dad's car. While we were doing this, David started throwing these seed type things that have orange pollen on them and stain your clothes very well. So I got just a few big orange marks on my pants and shirt. Yes. And that was my wonderful, elusive day. &nbsp;    Last song I listened to:   Jane  by Ben Folds Five.    Last album I listened to:   The Unauthorized Biography Of Reinhold Messner .    Last meal I ate:  Chicken, green beans, rice.   Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .

Funniest thing that happened today:  A kid on a skateboard smoking a cigarette obviously did not know where he was going, and he asked for directions to the Geneva Train Station from my neighborhood.

       The only thing I really did today was tried to take an Xbox controller back to Circuit City... Apparently if one wants to return a broken item, one must deal directly through the manufacturer (aka: Microsoft :P). So we'll see about that. Anyways. I also went out to try to find a new CD or MP3 player that I could take with me for the ride up to Canada on Tuesday, but everything was really crappy and really expensive. One of these days, when I have the money, I will just break down and buy an iPod. I must admit, Apple products really are superior (shut up, David, because I know what you're thinking). Well, I was fruitless on the MP3/CD player hunt, as you may have guessed. So I guess I'll need to head out and buy some double-A batteries at the least :P. Ugh... Well that's my story. I hope you had a nice time wasting less than a minute of your life reading it. &nbsp;    Last song I listened to:   Brick  by Ben Folds Five.    Last album I listened to:   Some Kind Of Monster .

Favorite song today:   Narcolepsy  by Ben Folds Five.    Favorite food today:  This weird basil-seasoned roll. Good stuff.    Most interesting thing I did today:  Went shopping... in computer and electronics stores, of course!   Funniest thing that happened today:  I was talking to my brother and didn't realize that he had the digital camera in his hand, so he just flashed it right in my face in the middle of my sentence. That was weird.

       Sorry for the random Metallica lyrics-related title for the second post in a row... or something like that. Anyways, I went out to lunch with my dad and my brother, and after that I took my driver's test and passed! I know, finally! Woot. But it sucks because they weren't giving out licenses today because the computer system was down throughout the state, so I have to go back another day and get my actual license. After that, I went out to play tennis with my dad. That was fun. And that's all. &nbsp;    Last song I listened to:   Some Kind Of Monster  by Metallica.

       Today was pretty boring. I have been spending most of my time lately playing games on  urlLink addictinggames.com  - it's great fun; you should check it out. My dad and brother and I went out to Circuit City earlier tonight and I picked up a few new albums for our trip to Canada next week. Woot. Anyways. We got a new digital camera, too, so I'll take some pictures in Canada for all of you guys to see; I'll probably post them on my blog and make some photo albums to put on my home page. &nbsp;    Last song I listened to:   Some Kind Of Monster  by Metallica.

       Well, today was interesting. I went to play tennis again at 10 this morning with Moe, Erin, and Melissa. It was really hot outside, and nobody wanted to play after a while, so I hit a few balls with some random tennis instructor at Big Woods and was told I should join the tennis team. Go figure. Then we went to Erin and Moe's and played ping pong and watched the Cubs game - I am still perturbed that they lost. Anyways. I'm so worn out from playing tennis for the past two days. I even fell asleep for almost 2 hours once I got home. Oh, yeah... And David still hasn't got the web portal working.

       Man, I really wore myself out today. I played tennis from 10:00 till 1:30 or so this morning/afternoon, and then as soon as I came home I had to mow the lawn. So I've basically felt like sleeping for the entire day since that point. We're trying to set up a new web portal here... I'll let you know when it's up. Our newest site design idea is for a website where you can meet new people to communicate with on AIM/ICQ/Y!/MSN.

        "Revolutions have never lightened the burden of tyranny: they have only shifted it to another shoulder." - George Bernard Shaw  This is yet another aspect of this world that is so sad but true. Humans often do not have the power to revolt productively and maintain that forward progress peacefully. The saddest part is that no one will ever have the power to stop these kinds of things from happening. Remember entropy? Entropy is the idea that the world has a strong tendency toward chaos. What can we do? Mankind in general is not intelligent enough to figure it out. If only everyone would take the time and thought to seek the guidance of God through His Word. I'm sorry for rambling on. I'm exhausted.

       Well I spent most of today playing ping pong/table tennis with my brother. I'm crazy good at that game. Other than that, I mowed the lawn this morning. I'm feeling kinda grungy right now, so I'm going to go take a shower. Tomorrow's my mom's birthday, so we're going to the Chicago Botanic Garden for the day and having a picnic! Fun stuff. Ta ta for now.     Last song I listened to:   Squishy  from the  Finding Nemo  original soundtrack.    Last album I listened to:  Soundtrack from  Finding Nemo .    Last meal I ate:  Fish sticks and fries. Yuck.    Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .    Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .    Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I listened to October by Eric Whitacre today.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  No sé, mis amigos.    Last person I talked to:  Erin.    Favorite song today:  Main Title from  Finding Nemo .    Favorite food today:  No sé.    Most interesting thing I did today:  Played ping pong. Woot.   Funniest thing that happened today:  We're going to Canada, eh?

        "Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything." - George Bernard Shaw  Ever run into a stubborn person? I have. I'm a stubborn person, and I agree that you must be versatile in order to make progress, but what happens when you stubbornly know the right answer and no one will accept that fact :P? But, nevertheless, a change of mind is good for everyone once in a while. It helps us open up our minds and, indeed, make progress. But often when you've been holding a certain opinion about something and you change that opinion, people will look upon you as a sort of hypocrite or traitor of sorts. But who cares? Their opinions never matter anyways.

       Well, band was officially killed today because I found out that we're not going to the U of I Marching Band Festival in October. That was like the best part of the whole year in band. On top of that, did&nbsp;I mention that our music selection absolutely sucks? Yeah... It's like all Beach Boys music (shudder).&nbsp;Oh well. I'm thinking about going by myself regardless of the&nbsp;"scheduling conflicts" :P.&nbsp;Anyways. So today I went with my mom and my brother to the mall in Oakbrook for the whole day. That was fun. I picked up some new stuff. And that was all I did! Exciting.      Last song I listened to:   Suite From Porgy &amp; Bess  by the Boston Pops.    Last album I listened to:  Soundtrack from Cirque du Soleil's  La Nouba .    Last meal I ate:  Tuna sandwich, rice.    Last movie I watched:   For Your Eyes Only .    Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .    Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I actually am saddened by the fact that we're not going to the U of I Marching Band Festival.    Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd: &nbsp;Making marshmallow oxide. Woot.&nbsp;    Last person I talked to:  Erin.    Favorite song today:   Stairway To Heaven  by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.    Favorite food today:  Rice.    Most interesting thing I did today:  Went shopping for the first time in an eternity :P.    Funniest thing that happened today:  My mom sat down in a massage chair at Brookstone and burst out laughing because she claimed it felt like animals were running through the chair. Oh my...

       Well this is early for me to be making my post for the night! Regardless, I made a new web design template today, and it really looks pretty nice! You can check it out in the web template section at  urlLink DHP1080.com . Feel free to comment and let me know what you think. Oh! And I made a  urlLink deviantART  account today and posted my new template design  urlLink here . Other than that, nothing really major happened today.

Favorite song today:   Rectifier  by RA.   Favorite food today:  S'mores.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Made my awesome new web design template.

I guess you really had to be there.

        "I'm not a teacher: only a fellow-traveler of whom you asked the way. I pointed ahead -- ahead of myself as well as you." - George Bernard Shaw  Because of its essential completeness, it is difficult to make constructive comment on this quote, other than to say it is amazingly thoughtful, thought-provoking, and well-worded, and it beautifully illustrates the progression of two eternal and essential parts of our existence: knowledge and learning.

       Sorry about the random title... I'm listening to System Of A Down right now. I listen to Internet radio to hear new songs, but all I'm hearing are songs that I listen to every day. What's up with that? Frustrating. Also, I will unfortunately never understand why women are attracted to men with brown hair and blue eyes because not enough scientific research has been done on the topic to provide a base for my own further research :P. Steph, I know you'll be disappointed to hear this. Anyways. Not too much happened today. I went to Jewel Middle School in North Aurora for a rehearsal for this Aurora band thing that I'm supposed to be involved with at 6:30 this evening, but no one was there! I tried to call Mr. Heath, but, being the excessively preoccupied person that he is, he was not at home. Oh well. Looks like I'm not going to the concert tomorrow... if there is one after all :P. I don't really remember anything else that happened today, except for when my brother tried to wave his hand in front of my face, missed, smacked me right in the nose, and managed to poke both of my eyes. That sucked. So I'll call that my day.     Last song I listened to:   Only The Strong  by Flaw.   Last album I listened to:   The Best Of George Gershwin .   Last meal I ate:  Spaghetti and meatballs.   Last movie I watched:   For Your Eyes Only .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I listened to random drumline cadences throughout the day.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I explained to my brother that we can hit the air, but it's always hitting us harder... Each particle hits us at 500 miles per hour :).   Last person I talked to:  Dan or Steph.   Favorite song today:   Careless Whisper  by Ben Folds featuring Rufus Wainwright.   Favorite food today:  Spaghetti :).   Most interesting thing I did today:  Criticized my brother's graphic designs. I love critic authority :).   Funniest thing that happened today:  Ugh. I have no idea.

       That's right; I made a web design template tonight, and I stayed up way too late doing so, since it is once again exactly 1:00 right now as I glance at the clock. I didn't put as much time and effort into this design as I had hoped I would, and it doesn't look  exactly  as I had envisioned it, but I still think it looks pretty ghetto... in a good way. you should be able to download it  urlLink here  soon. In other news, I mowed the lawn today. It was hot outside. And that is all.     Last song I listened to:   Holdin On  by Saliva.   Last album I listened to:   Back Into Your System .   Last meal I ate:  A Junior Bacon Cheeseburger and fries.   Last movie I watched:   For Your Eyes Only .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I listened to Illinois Loyalty this morning.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I was looking at metal backgrounds on the Internet this evening, and as I came to some that were more rust than metal, I said, "These aren't  metal  backgrounds; these are metal  oxide  backgrounds" :P.   Last person I talked to:  Melissa.   Favorite song today:   Holdin On  by Saliva.   Favorite food today:  That Junior Bacon Cheeseburger was pretty good :).   Most interesting thing I did today:  Made my newest web template and graphics.   Funniest thing that happened today:  Saw a photo of a bum with a sign that said "Money for Beer." At least he was being honest :P.

       A while ago, I discovered a recording of  Stairway To Heaven  by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Sounds interesting, right? I hadn't picked it up for a while, but as I listen to it once again, I am reminded of how absolutely awesome it is! So. Check it out. Let me know if you like ;).   urlLink Chicago Symphony Orchestra - Stairway To Heaven

        "People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and if they can't find them, make them."  - George Bernard Shaw  I'm actually going to elaborate on this quote because I truly believe in it. I really believe that everyone is equal to everyone else as long as they are putting in enough work to make it for themselves. People tell me often that they are disgusted with "how smart I am." Damnit, you're blaming your circumstances when you're doing that! Rather than telling me, these individuals could be working harder to do and accomplish the same things that I am. People in general must learn not to waste their time complaining about why they can't do something; they should be using the time instead to gain those "circumstances" that they are looking up to and looking to achieve, and that is the factor that determines true success and fulfillment.

       Ugh. It's late, so I'll keep this short. I went to Sweet Tomatoes for lunch today. The food there was okay, but it's definitely not my favorite. I don't remember what I did for the rest of the day, but then at about 5:30 I went to play tennis at Mount St. Mary's for a while. It looked like it was going to storm, so we left. After that, I watched the Cubs beat the Cards (finally), and I played on Xbox Live with a bunch of crazy guys. Heh. I guess I lost track of the time while doing so. Good night.     Last song I listened to:   Don't Tread On Me  by Metallica.   Last album I listened to:   Metallica .   Last meal I ate:  Salad, bread, and pasta at Sweet Tomatoes.   Last movie I watched:   For Your Eyes Only .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  Again, I played my saxophone today.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I just started naming off the elements today while I was in Office Depot. And they were selling periodic table posters there, too.   Last person I talked to:  Steph.   Favorite song today:   Outlaw Torn  by Metallica.   Favorite food today:  Don't know.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Looked for a new digital camera in Office Depot.   Funniest thing that happened today:  Hahahaha, Steph. That is way too funny and ironic. I won't elaborate any further.

       This one's for yesterday because I stayed up until 1:30 AM or so, and I didn't feel like making a new post at that point. Anways. Well I didn't really go anywhere yesterday. I just played the piano a lot and played a little on Xbox Live. The funniest thing happened, though, last night. Late last night. You see, we found this free trial membership for Xbox Live, so we figured we'd make another account just for fun. We spent about an hour and a half coming up with random stupid nicknames because we couldn't decide on a good one. Finally, I just picked one and went to the next step to enter the activation code on the card. The code was rejected. So I looked at the back of the card, and it turned out that the thing expired back in March. What a waste of time. It angers me that they actually put expiration dates on the cards.     Last song I listened to:   Big Apple Heartbreak  by Yellowcard.   Last album I listened to:   One For The Kids .   Last meal I ate:  Nachos.   Last movie I watched:   Seabiscuit .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  Don't know.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  Once again, I don't know.   Last person I talked to:  Steph.   Favorite song today:   The Luckiest  by Ben Folds.   Favorite food today:  Don't know.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Wasted an hour and a half of my life trying to come up with a good gamertag on XBL. But it was still funny because everything gets funny when it's that late at night.   Funniest thing that happened today:  David managed to fall over in both directions in his chair, hitting his elbow first off the drumset and then off a plastic storage tub.

       So we went to Great America today. That was fun, but we didn't get on too many rides. Oh well. Going with my choir buddies was a lot more fun, and the lines were a lot shorter! We waited for Superman for 2 hours! That was bad. And I was very saddened to find out that both Vertical Velocity and Deja Vu were closed for the entire day :(. And, as usual, I got sunburned today. Like I said before, skin troubles are in my future :P. And that is all I have to say.     Last song I listened to:   Sabbra Cadabra  by Metallica.   Last album I listened to:   Garage, Inc. .   Last meal I ate:  Fries.   Last movie I watched:   Seabiscuit .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  Pfft.

Favorite food today:  I had a nectarine. That was good :).   Most interesting thing I did today:  I went to Six Flags.   Funniest thing that happened today:  I saw what looked like a six-year-old kid with a cell phone. How pathetic. But it was funny nonetheless.

       So. Today. I played tennis for a few hours this morning with Melissa. That was fun. Andy Roddick is hot. There were some British people sitting and talking in the park next to the courts... It was interesting to hear that type of accent in Chicagoland (Chi-CAAAAA-go-leeeeaaaaand). Crazy Illinois people. I will never conform :P! Anyways, like yesterday, I played the piano for hours on end, and I played some stuff on Xbox Live. And it turns out that I am going to Six Flags yet again tomorrow because my brother wants to go. So there. More fun for me :). And if you didn't hear about the other time I went last week or so, that was a lot of fun. I went with my church choir buddies. Andy screams like a girl! Heheh... Anyways. Right now, my mom is at a refresher class at Delnor, and she took my car :(. She called during her dinner break and told me about how she had to practice artificial respiration and CPR on a dummy. Heheheh. And my dad is in Cincinatti, Ohio, at some client's factory. I wanted to go with him and take a side trip to Paramount Kings Island, but that never happened because the "weather was supposed to be bad" :(. But since my parents aren't home, I can blare my music as loudly as I please regardless of the time >:). Well, I think that is all for now. Woo hoo! Tomorrow should be fun :). I bid you good night.     Last song I listened to:   Too Late Too Late  by Metallica.   Last album I listened to:   Garage, Inc. .   Last meal I ate:  Spaghetti.   Last movie I watched:   Seabiscuit .   Last movie I saw in a theater:  Friggin'  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban !

Wow, that really took me back :P.   Last person I talked to:  Steph.   Favorite song today:   The Element of One  by Killswitch Engage.   Favorite food today:  What? Julia enjoying something sweet in nature? Mmm... Peanut butter Rice Krispies treats.   Most interesting thing I did today:  I'm blaring Metallica in my room with the window wide open right now >:D. And tennis was fun.   Funniest thing that happened today:  I reminded David of his pants :). Heheh... A guy in a game I was playing kept yelling, "Gitterdone, y'all!" Oh, that was great. And some little kids attacked Melissa's car, and she bitched 'em out. That was great, too.

       Well, today I was recruited by Mr. Heath to be in the Aurora Community Summer Band (or something like that anyways) because they are in need of a bari sax player, so I'm going to be busy for the next two weeks on Tuesday nights for rehearsals and Wednesday nights for concerts. Apparently it is a paid gig, so I'll get a little fundage out of it :). I played the piano a whole bunch today, and I played Crimson Skies with my brother on Xbox Live. How eventful.     Last song I listened to:   The Luckiest  by Ben Folds.   Last album I listened to:   One For The Kids .   Last meal I ate:  A Whopper from Burger King.   Last movie I watched:   Seabiscuit .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  Umm... The summer band thing. Who else but a band nerd would spend their time doing something like that?   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  Discussing with Dan why Mr. Wheeler was such a terrific teacher.   Last person I talked to:  Melissa.   Favorite song today:   A.W.O.L.  by Yellowcard.   Favorite food today:  I can't say I thoroughly enjoyed anything I ate today.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Improvising a little on the piano. Try it sometime - it's a lot of fun when you're bored :D.   Funniest thing that happened today:  Nothing excruciatingly hilarious took place today :(. It's too bad because I could have used a good laugh :P.

       Today was so boring that it doesn't even deserve a synopsis. However, I did do quite a bit of work today; I mowed three lawns and washed my car - I like shininess :). Anyways, I got a blister on the inside of my thumb today while mowing the lawn, and it apparently popped while I was mowing, too. And then I got to stick it in some nice, dirty, soapy water to wash the car. Fun stuff. So I'm sure you're pretty grossed out by now, so I will stop :D.     Last song I listened to:   Emaline  live by Ben Folds Five.   Last album I listened to:   One For The Kids .   Last meal I ate:  Salisbury steak. Yuck.   Last movie I watched:   Seabiscuit .

Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I found a collection of programs from band/choir/jazz concerts in my closet today... Along with my pep band shirt :P.

Last person I talked to:  Dan or Melissa   Favorite song today:   Gimme Three Steps  by Lynyrd Skynyrd.   Favorite food today:  I'm going with a beverage again - water :P.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Washed my car so it shines. It needed it bad. Heheh :P.   Funniest thing that happened today:  David ripped his pants completely by pulling on a tab on the back. Maybe it was a self-destruct tab :P.

       Today was a loooooong day. Yeah, so I awoke this morning at 6:00 - probably the earliest this summer so far - got showered, and spent two and a half hours at church. Sitting through the same service twice in a row is not exactly my idea of fun, but oh well. After church, I stayed home and watched Andy Roddick lose to Roger Federer at Wimbledon. Tear :*(. Moving right along, I played tennis today for two and a half hours, too, and that was great fun. I swear I'm going to get skin cancer as a result of too much sun exposure this summer. Anyways, my dad went out to buy a new racquet, and this thing apparently features something called "Power Bulge Technology." I think I have some of that in my stomach region :). Oh yes - and things did not go as planned today, mainly because it would have had to do with burning blue hand rinse solution. Ahem. I won't go into detail :P. Instead, I went to the fireworks at the high school with Dan and David, and we met Steph, Jayne, and Poawtah there. I swear Dan and I are going to take over music duties for the show next year :P. And that's the story of my long day.     Last song I listened to:   Chemistry  by Semisonic.   Last album I listened to:   One For The Kids .   Last meal I ate:  Fried chicken, macaroni salad, root beer.   Last movie I watched:   Seabiscuit .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban . I must see  Spidey !   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  All the band nerds started singing "Sing, Sing, Sing" and "Thriller" at the fireworks. It didn't last very long, however :P.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I looked up the densities of various gases. Propane is heavier than air. Congratulations; you learned something today. Oh yes... I also listened to the chemistry song a few times.   Last person I talked to:  Melissa.   Favorite song today:   Rough Draft  by Yellowcard.   Favorite food today:  Does fruit punch count as a food?   Most interesting thing I did today:  I beat my dad in a short set, 3 games to 1 :).   Funniest thing that happened today:  Hmm... Jayne got up and performed an interpretive dance for us at the fireworks. That was amusing. And the tennis racquet with the "Power Bulge;" that is good stuff.

       Today was the laziest day I have experienced in a long time. Maybe it was the weather? Anyways, other than doing some laundry, nothing productive happened until like ten o'clock tonight :). If all goes well tomorrow, I will explain to you the result of this productivity ;).     Last song I listened to:   Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head  by Ben Folds Five.

       Well, today was interesting. Melissa and I were supposed to go and play tennis, but we actually ended up not going at all. My dad and brother and I went to Fry's Electronics in Downer's Grove at around 2:30, looked around for a while, went to Tiger Direct to return something, and got back at about 6:00 PM, so we had some dinner right afterwards. Anyways, that Fry's place is absolutely enormous! It was practically a supersize Best Buy with a café in the middle (and more stuff!). I had a smoothie while I was there, as a matter of fact. It was good :). So... That was basically my whole day.     Last song I listened to:   Mississippi Kid  by Lynyrd Skynyrd.    Last album I listened to:   Pronounced Leh-nerd Skin-nerd .

       I stayed up way too late last night, so I slept late this morning. I mowed the lawn and washed my car, and then I took a shower. Exciting thus far, right :P? Today was Nicole's birthday, so we decided to go to Caribou and hang there for a while. Jake showed up earlier than the rest of us because he apparently didn't hear that we were all coming at 7:30 or so... I was the second to arrive, so I sat outside and talked with Jake for a while. I saw Erica there (I hadn't seen her in a while) with Tim, and I was disappointed to see that she has really let herself go and is smoking and stuff. She even told me when I said "hello" that she wasn't sure if I would recognize her or not. We spoke very briefly about college and all that... Anyways... Steph and Poawtah showed up, so we went inside and talked for a bit. Jake left to "run errands" :P, and Nicole and Steph and I had some interesting discussions about various stuff. It was all in all a good time. I decided to leave at 10 because my mom wanted me to be home around then... So yeah. That was my day.     Last song I listened to:   Magic Bus  by The Who.

       OK. This is the fourth time I have had to rewrite this stupid post. Here I go again. Of course, you will only see it once, but it's really starting to piss me off. Anyways. Take four! Our insurance agent came to my house this morning to go over some rates and stuff and go through the principles behind this "Y.E.S." program deal so I get lower insurance rates than  all of you ! Haha! Anyways. After that affair I went to school to check on my parking spot status and to see if I could get a copy of my last semester's report card faxed to the insurance office. I came up fruitless in both efforts. Oh well. I came home, had some lunch, and my mom and I went out to a few stores. I returned home once again and then my mom and I left to go to church to neaten up the flower beds and bushes and the like. I guess we were there to make the building look a little nicer for Pastor Jim's funeral on Friday. He passed away on Tuesday night. Enough sadness for one post. We worked at church for a bit more than two hours, and I swear I am still coated with a fine layer of dust from sweeping off this filthy pathway running alongside the building :P. Yeah. So I came home and I have just been chilling out, playing the piano... Stuff like that. I'm trying to break this late night habit in order to wake up early with enough energy stored up to cause my brain to function correctly, so we'll see how that goes :P.     Last song I listened to:   Army  by Ben Folds Five.    Last album I listened to:   The Unauthorized Biography Of Reinhold Messner .    Last meal I ate:  About one half of a Whopper, a Coke, and some fries.    Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .    Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .    Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I missed band camp for the second day in a row :P.    Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I noticed in the garden section at Home Depot that it was warmer near the plants. I thought to myself, "That is because of the numerous exothermic reactions occurring within each individual plant cell!" I guess that could go down as a biology nerd moment, too :P.    Last person I talked to:  Steph.    Favorite song today:   Don't Change Your Plans  by Ben Folds.    Favorite food today:  Tangerine sour Altoids.    Most interesting thing I did today:  Worked at church.    Funniest thing that happened today:  I was demonstrating to my brother how on my first attempt at writing this post, I pushed the little "back" button on my mouse... Except I actually pressed it and I had to start, once again, all over. That was so  stupid !

       Well, I'm lazy and I don't want to type too much, so I'll keep this relatively short. Today was the last band camp day! Woo hoo! The morning was pretty routine, and in the afternoon we won the squad competition, so we got to perform our little show during the demonstration tonight that all the parents and such attended. That was fun. In preparation for this, we covered Mr. Heath's, Mr. Lesniak's, and Mr. Buckley's cars in streamers and car paint. That was fun. And on the backs of our shirts we wrote messages informing them to check their cars. More fun :). We had a lot of fun with the squad competition, and I guess the show went pretty well, too. Band camp is over! Hooray! Except for the fact that now there are about two weeks until school starts up again :(.      Last song I listened to:   Tuesday's Gone  by Lynyrd Skynyrd.

       Somehow I have a feeling that tonight is going to be a late night. Today was another day at band camp, week two. Only one day left! Woo hoo! Anyways, today I skipped part of the morning session because it was basically orientation for the people that weren't at camp last week. That made me a little perturbed, so at about 10:15 I went home and mowed the lawn and showered off and went back to camp after lunch. The rest of the day was pretty much a normal day at band camp. Normal. Right.      Last song I listened to:   25 Or 6 To 4  by Chicago.   Last album I listened to:   The Very Best Of Chicago: Only The Beginning .

       Well, today I went to church at 9:30, and Kyle and Nicole were drafted to be accolytes. That was pretty funny. I went home and did stuff. Namely, I played the piano and scanned some old band photos. Then my mom and I went out to a few random stores, and I bought a new Chicago album and some Altoids. Woo hoo. Tonight I went through a bunch of old pictures of me and my family and friends and stuff. That was interesting. So yeah. It's back to band camp starting tomorrow... Fun, fun, fun. I'd better get some sleep soon. Good night.      Last song I listened to:   Tuesday's Gone  by Lynyrd Skynyrd.   Last album I listened to:   Prounounced Leh-nerd Skin-nerd .

       Well I didn't sleep very late this morning after all. I felt like I had been hickory smoked from the bonfire last night, so I got up and showered and went with my family to breakfast at Lumes. Then we went to some random places in Aurora. Yeah. And I stayed home and played the piano (which has been my addiction of late) and did some other stuff.

       Today was a lot of fun. It's Friday, so it was the last day of band camp for the week; we start up again on Monday. It was also a half day of band camp; we were released at 12:00. I went home, had some lunch, and drove over to Big Woods park to play tennis with Erin, Moe, and Melissa. Traffic on Wilson Street was the worst I have ever seen it on the way over :P. And oh, my... I got so incredibly sunburned today; I am probably the reddest I have been all summer. We left the park at about 3:00, so that left me with about two and a half hours to get showered and do whatever before Melissa, Steph, Poawtah, Erin, Moe, Matt, Marjorie, and I headed to TGI Friday's for dinner. I drove over there with Steph and split a cheeseburger with Erin; it was pretty good. We didn't really have any plans after dinner, and Steph had to be out of her house for a good part of the night because of her mom's teen-aphobic "friend" named Ken, so we decided to have a bonfire at Marjorie's place. That was... um... interesting to say the least :P, involving "band nerd tipping" (as opposed to cow tipping). I won't go into detail, but it was lots of fun (Thanks, Marjorie!). I was supposed to leave at ten, so I did. I played the piano for a while once I got home, and that takes me up to about right now. So that was my busy day.      Last song I listened to:   Zak And Sara  by Ben Folds.   Last album I listened to:   Rockin' The Suburbs .   Last meal I ate:  Half of a cheeseburger and fries.

Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  Yelling "step and close!" at our little bonfire when we were counting.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  Watching wood and marshmallows combust and making aluminum oxide.   Last person I talked to:  Carl.   Favorite song today:   Fired  by Ben Folds.   Favorite food today:  I do not know.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Dinner at Friday's and the fire at Marjorie's.

       It's beginning to get late and I am tired once again. Today was a good day at band camp. I went out to lunch at California Pizza Kitchen with Ed and his girlfriend, Dan, Erik, Dan, Steph, Jayne, Melissa, Kim, James, Emily, and I think I forgot someone, so I am sorry. We were really late when we came back, so we carried James in tied to a flag pole. That was fun and interesting and we actually received a compliment from Mr. Lesniak about it... That was even more funny and interesting. Anyways. I went home to dinner and then went back to school to register. What was sad about that is that the picture I took for my ID was probably better than all of the other pictures I've taken in high school, and this is the one that doesn't count :P. What a load of crap. Oh well. Tonight's rehearsal went pretty well; we put music to our maneuvers on the field. And we were all crazy as usual - the best part of band camp. We made some plans for tomorrow night, so we'll see how that goes. After all, it's only a half day of band camp and then two days off! Woo hoo! G'night.

       Well, woo hoo. I'm celebrating my 50th blog post. Blah. I've just about run out of gas. This is the second night in a row that I have almost forgotten to write something in this blog, so you know I must be sleepy. In fact, please forgive me if anything here sounds completely incoherent. Today was a band camp day. Something was wrong with the show. Blah, blah, blah... Something about tennis... Some food I ate... Um... That's all. I've already forgotten what I have written thus far. Lots of craziness and laughing - and drama - at the rehearsal tonight. Despite the drama, that was so much fun. By the way, we've got some inconsiderate, immature, and illogical people in the Batavia High School band program... Just in case you did not already know this. Good night.      Last song I listened to:   Until It Sleeps  by Metallica.   Last album I listened to:   The Unauthorized Biography Of Reinhold Messner .   Last meal I ate:  Macaroni & cheese.   Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  Oh, you know. The usual yelling and screaming and insanity at band camp.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I don't know.   Last person I talked to:  Dan.   Favorite song today:   Don't Change Your Plans  by Ben Folds Five.   Favorite food today:  I do not know.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Once again. Stupid band camp. I'm such a nerd.

       I'd really better get to bed soon, so I'll make this as quick as possible. Today was the first day of band camp! Seniors! Woot. And I am first chair in the saxophone section this year, so that is pretty cool. The morning session of band camp was a pain. You know, reviewing how to walk and stand is not exactly my idea of fun. I went home for lunch and ate some food, sat around, played the piano. We had our music rehearsal in the afternoon, and I realized that there are not many good saxophone players in the band this year. Or, if there are any, they simply were not at camp. So yeah. Dinner came next. That was a nice break. The night session today was cool, most definitely. Paul, Jake, and Mikey B. are in my squad this year, so that should provide for some good times. Anyways. I was hoping for some more interesting and rigorous drills and music... That always makes band just a little more fun for those of us who actually wish to try. However, the show this year is downright elementary and stupid. Straight lines, lines, lines... Hey, look! More lines! Probably because we're slacking off for not going to U of I this year. Roar. I'll stop complaining now. By the way, our dismissal is awesome! I wonder why ;)... Well that was really not a short post at all. Oh well. Good night.      Last song I listened to:   Magic  by Ben Folds Five.   Last album I listened to:   The Unauthorized Biography Of Reinhold Messner .   Last meal I ate:  Scallops with linguine.

Woot woot!   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I don't know.   Last person I talked to:  Melissa.   Favorite song today:   Don't Change Your Plans  by Ben Folds Five.   Favorite food today:  Salad with Italian Dressing.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Umm... Went to band camp? Oh, actually, that is  all  I did today :P.   Funniest thing that happened today:  Permanent convertible! And the idea of Jayne driving an airbrushed car with a tarp over her head. Good times.

       Argh! Band camp is tomorrow! I really don't want to go :(. Oh well. I guess I am just a lazy senior after all. Anyways. I worked pretty hard today. In addition to washing two cars last night, I washed my car this afternoon. Not only did I wash it, but I waxed the finish, as well. Not only did I wax it; I shined the tires and rims. Not only did I shine the tires and rims; I cleaned all of the windows inside. So yes. I tried for perfection today, and I suppose it paid off. Tonight, I went to play tennis at BHS... That was interesting. I guess the quality of the courts has declined. Yeah, that's all.      Last song I listened to:   Magic  by Ben Folds Five.

Last person I talked to:  Melissa.   Favorite song today:   Don't Change Your Plans  by Ben Folds Five.   Favorite food today:  I don't know.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Cleaned the car and played tennis.   Funniest thing that happened today:  My brother was operating his IRC chat server and he changed some poor guy's name to "imanidiot" without any warning. And of course this guy burst out laughing. It was pretty amusing... I guess you had to be there.

       Well, today should have been eventful; we were thinking about going downtown for the day, but my brother complained that he felt sick, so we just went to Cantigny and left him at home instead. We didn't stay there for very long; we just walked through the gardens for a little while and left. We then went to Gino's East for pizza and brought some home for David. Tonight was exciting :P. I played some intense ping pong with my brother and then we washed my mom's and dad's cars, which I really didn't understand because the point was indeed to wash mine, and we never ended up getting to it... Hmm... Anyways. As I am typing I am still a little wet from doing that. And that is all, my friends.      Last song I listened to:   Damage, Inc.  by Metallica.
