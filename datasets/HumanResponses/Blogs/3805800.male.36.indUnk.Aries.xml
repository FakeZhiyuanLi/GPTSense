      I am the prophet of insignificance, the seer of the void, the cipher of the apocalypse  In my hands burn the six keys to the vacuous doors of tomorrow  The First one is  urlLink Dichloro-Diphenyl-Trichloroethane ; sweets for the crucified young  The Second is  urlLink Lyserg Saure Diethylamid 25 , deceitful dream of vapid paradise  The Third is  urlLink Thalidomide ; dangling carrot for the two-toed child  The Fourth is  urlLink Diazepam ; chill teat where the limp baby succors  The Fifth is  urlLink Agent Orange ; necklace of ruby-hued tumours draped on pale blue skin  The Sixth is  urlLink the Pill ; counterfeit pulse of the moon  In my eyes flow the sands of a thousand deserts. In my mouth are the tears of those yet unborn On my waist is chained the Book of Empty pages which is your life Each page scorched blank with ashes of past indiscretions I stand at the altar of your future where each hour of the false confusion is Consecrated It is there I watch your struggle to put meaning to the meaningless  Come, Celebrate the Great Mass of your folly in the Flesh of vacant evil Wear this opal as it weeps a spent rainbow of shade around your thick neck Gaze into my face and see the impotence of the generations to come Feel the barren soil of your deeds, where each seed of discontent was sown with abandon  All you are left are the stillborn amusements at which you play Your world has nothing for you or your children yet you continue  Stale circles practicing a culture of Death  Even in this death there is no honor, no glory, re rest You die with mediocrity in your bile: a whimper In your time there is no history, only the momentary blur of missed  Opportunity A corpse for burial dissected by apes, it sputters in the phlegm of the living dead.

      I don't want to be corny, or cliché, but certain information should be contained in the first post to a new blog - something that tells you what to expect, where the blog is going to try and go, even the kind of audience it is looking for. And it should give you a glimmer of the person behind it, the all-powerful author draining his blood through the keyboard onto the screens of the world.  I am a writer. I am many other things, but I am most at home with words and the flow of letters that open the conduit from my mind and inner life into the bright sunshine of the world where it quivers for the other, all others and makes whatever sense it can of life.  When I write I feel like a  urlLink Charlie Parker  or  urlLink Jimmy Smith  solo. My mind speeds along, fingers trying to keep up, each letter jumping in line with the next until the pages are full and I feel spent.   I don't care much for the daily entries of people's life. I have enough of my own life to live and wade through. I also don't have the time for the ubiquitous lack of quality that pervades most on, and off, line writing. It’s as if the ability to use words has slipped from our hands into the darkest crevasses of our world, hiding, waiting until the flash of technology and all its self-importance becomes encrusted and oxidizes. Only then will the use of language come back to the very people who need it most. Words and the richness of language seem to have been lifted from our minds while we stroll the local malls wanting to consume our way to the inner peace that has nothing to do with the exchange of money, but everything to do with the exchange of ideas and emotions. Instead of enjoying the steam rise from a fresh hot cup of coffee and being able to drift along in a conversation full of passion and nuance with a new friend, we are forced into sterile electronic blurbs and verbiage. If we are becoming more and more dependent on text then we should revel in its joys and drink deeply from its richness of form and function. That is what I intend to do, making as few spelling and grammatical errors along the way.

      I have to gear up to write more each day. I have a short story idea that I want to finish up. I have earlier drafts, but they really suck, so I am going to start fresh. Should be good because it has  urlLink Nazis  and  urlLink cannibalism !!
