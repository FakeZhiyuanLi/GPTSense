      I've been reading Fanny Howe still. I enjoy her work so much:  Unable to rest because unable to know.  If Christ doesn't rise in two hours, then God has forsaken us all. The whitening of the east spreads over the west. Mourning doves warble.  Morning men are raving on the beach, of alcohol and some mental derangement associated with loss.*  Last night, a good film:  urlLink The Corporation .   * Moving Borders: Three Decades of Innovative Writing by Women , ed Mary Margaret Sloan, Talisman House, 1998.

      It's late. I'm reading Chomsky's blog over on Znet, trying to keep up with his insights about the Middle East, which are increasingly frightening.   An independent Iraq would probably take steps to gain a leading position in the Arab world, which would mean confronting the main enemy, US-backed Israel.... Can you imagine the US tolerating anything like this?              What's frightening to me is the idea that the same thing could feasibly happen with both Iran & Syria very soon. The stops are in place: threats of Iran's nuclear capacity, & Syria's too. No one's mentioning ours. Why don't we get 'overthrown'? We have plenty of WMD. It makes me want to vomit.  I need to stop worrying about the election. Every four years or so, people show up & feel like good citizens. Kerry's DNC speech tonight was rousing but centrist (which means rightist in these parts).   A new poem, in the making, & my poetics is on the way:  Take me on directly. This is my Letter Of Resignation. From the sole to the soul again. My mother always told me to man the stops with the right toe forward. I listened, breathless, pinching my own undrawn arm.    Great Power , I’m resigning from your coalition.

      I am not persuaded by arguments. This week, a harshness in returning to my life. Perhaps I'm on the cusp of a break. A needed break. I've been in the same place for so long.  I'm still reading Fanny Howe these days:  When she was alone in her cell, she didn't exist. Only bliss. Clay angels Popped off the walls outside, fates For each figure, the highways Couldn't be reversed.*  *culled from my anthology of choice lately,  Moving Borders: Three Decades of Innovative Writing by Women , ed. Mary Margaret Sloan, Talisman House, 1998.

      A link to an interesting article on CounterPunch:  urlLink the truth about Jimmy Carter . My own emotion is swaying me as I listen to the Democratic Convention this week. It's an odd commodity: the speeches are all pretty listless linguistically & structurally, but folks are really riled up.

      I'd like to give Vaclav Havel a big kiss:  Absurdity is the experience that something that has, should or could have aspired to meaning---that is, something intrinsically human---does not do so at all, or else has lost it. It is, therefore, the experience of losing touch with Being, the experience of a disintegration of the power to confer meaning, the experience of a humanity that has discovered it has defrauded itself.... The moon is not absurd. What is absurd is the junkyard man has left on it.*  Only a saint could turn machinations into a vehicle of change. Only a saint could turn emptiness & darkness into light.  I suppose it's been done, but not so well & so vocally by a former world figure. He bears all the marks of honesty: imprisonment, unabashed epicureanism, gushing.  Perhaps it's time (or past time) for a pilgrimage to Katernia, the village my grandmother's family was from. It's in Bohemia, near Prague.  I'd like to think it looks something like central Pennsylvania, what I remember of it, towards Philadelphia, on highways past fields & starkness.   * from  Letters to Olga   The finished 4th draft (I try to do 4 quick drafts at once), begun & finished over days, which usually doesn't happen! Traveling cuts the mind in half, in a good way, I hope.  Conservativism notwithstanding,   I’ve been practicing your flute with the dogs. The low howling whirrs in the clicks a little.   Mary polishes the inside of a dying cup. The high moon spins.  My first priority is sleep.  Not noetic: the myrrh-bleeding stub  of elbow socket, sprouting the aesthetic  wing-stem. Let me generate the chord charts for    your part. Some Republican says  luxury is worth it on the  parallel bridges.   I can smell you jutting out from broken  wave to bent pole. Loamlike & cresting, what’s your final answer to the road’s caves?  The inaudible rattling, the blowing of air through pipes. One homophony: groaning, a deaf man’s sight: the motion of the blooming.   Not wind and breath alone, but more of the tattooed  tree. It echoes. The gale forces  itself through the nostrils & over the broken shield.  Mary strokes the inside of   her lover’s leg, rubbing off the  thin shrived hairs.   The sly moon cringes. What  do you base yourself on? Not  less than slipping out of monsoon edges,   the martyric hum & liftings.  A section from Diane Ackerman's amazing book,  Natural History of the Senses , mentioned many times here & already reminding me of the beach:  A dolphin has a brain as complex as our own; it has language, culture, and emotions. It has its own society, with codes of conduct, family groups, and a civilization, but it lives in a world on "our" planet, as we like to say with chauvinistic bravado, unimaginably different from our own. We may have much to learn from it. Deep down, we know our marriage to reality is just a marriage of convenience, and we leave it to the seers, the shamans, the ascetics, the religious teachers, the artists among us to reach a higher state of awareness.... It began in mystery, and it will end in mystery.

      I've been watching & listening to the Boston convention this evening. It's interesting. I'm not a Democrat, but I guess you could say I'm way more Democrat than Republican, &amp; I'm moved by the "rhetoric" (if you want to call it that).   Jimmy Carter has a way, I think, of getting to the heart of things. In spite of his speech plugging Kerry & Edwards (just like everyone else has done, including Kucinich, whom I really like), he managed to continue to assert his platform, which is that of human rights.   It's not a bad platform to have. People who talk about the "economy" without acknowledging the greater implications that policies have are sickening to me.   Conservatism notwithstanding, I've been practicing your flute with the dogs. The low howling whirrs in the clicks a little.

      It's raining in Atlanta, my first night back here & the water has followed me from Amelia Island. I could live at the beach, I think. I think I could adjust to the slow pace after all.  I finished  Natural History of the Senses . It's a fabulous book.

      Tomorrow I return to Atlanta, to my normal life. I'm not particularly happy to return, but not sad either. I've been trying to work on a poem while I'm here & have gotten a couple of lines at most, which is unusual for me.   But the water is lovely, & I'll miss the sound of the waves.  Today, good listening:  Buena Vista Social Club . I must've walked a good 10-12 miles this morning.   Dancing....

      Beach walking is unique: you're at a slant (if you're like me & want to get your feet wet) &amp; therefore slower & dizzy at the end. I have distinct pains from the&nbsp;slant.   I walked to the pier today, listening to  Green Grow the Rushes  &amp; Michael Stipe's haunting "amber waves of grain" vocal, while actually being  in  the waves. It was nice.

       *   Mother used to gather the car for me to drive away in.   The car was lost in a sweeping. Colors of flame and finally the ultimate  burst . I used to have favorite types of fire: the bright white, the cyan, the fingering orange. My body: burning, on a wire, for no one to salvage for meat. The newspapers are full of pictures of crying women and victimized soldiers. Their children sleep at night, lightly.   *    O keeper, lend me the better part of the following things: a basket woven from frayed strands / and / or / twigs; a runny-eyed kitten ; I write my incomplete prayer out, solid. Its solidity frightens me: if I pray to a  keeper , am I asking a / the / god / God / for bottles of fresh milk? I cannot think of a better word. I want to be kept: i.e. held; maintained; numbered; kept down; limited; circumscribed; confined; continued; proceeded; kept on; litigated; processed; sued; proceeded against; asked; requested; challenged; expedited; withheld; kept back; conserved; preserved; saved; denied; refused; blocked; frozen; immobilized; prevented; checked; broken off; paused suddenly; defended; observed; made good; looked after; catered; plied; provided; supplied; had; held; kept up; accommodated; lodged; abided; borne; brooked; endured; stood; stomached; suffered; tolerated; patronized; left; left unaltered; left unchanged; rested; stayed; celebrated; ritualized; commemorated; marked; bielded; retained; kept on; entered; recorded; put down; held open; kept open; lived; supported; bread-and-buttered; resourced; subsisted; celled; jail-celled; donjoned; dungeoned; brigged; strongholded; oublietted; castled; gamed; played; turned.  O keeper, lock me in . I’m a good trembler, a good begging trembler. Someone will write me on a calendar as a card to send. Mother will mark her arms with my fingerprints.   *   There are moments when a child’s face hurts to touch. The child wants to hang a sign on himself:  Closed. Not open. Not open for business . Mother makes an addendum:  Back in 30 minutes , the goofy little clock with the plastic arms, hanging from the kitchen stove. The child winds the hands until they point downward, at 6:30, from loose cogs.  6:30 is a good time for Mother to come back , he thinks. He hides his face in a bucket of warm water.   *   The mother does not return. He sleeps with the TV on. No one shows him how to fit his feet through the pajama bottoms. He sleeps with his jeans unbuttoned, for comfort.   Morning ticks by.   Mother lineates her checkbook at the train station.   Mother slopes into the garage.   The downstairs neighbors are suing for custody. Mother falls out of her pearls. The moon catches twenty-seven oysters, one for each year of her life. It is Mother’s birthday, she is hoarding a soot-bag and three bottles of gin, one for every important lover. It is almost Christmas. The child is cold. Mother marries a toeless immigrant. The child falls into sin. I heard that he ended up making an elaborate fortune in the mines. He died young. Mother wrapped herself in a smarmy man’s web, held the gun to her head, and backed out. I heard that she fell into a very deep hole called America.   *   In Mother’s house there are many rooms. Each room is painted with my blood. In Mother’s house I creep between windows, looking for the rustle of enemy leaves. In Mother’s house I cannot hear, I must revise myself into one passing movement: the barrel of a rifle snagging on a vine.   It is disabled by the green.

      I have been told I have "Slavic feet." (The second toe is shorter than the big toe.)   More from Havel, whom I proudly call a countryman of sorts:  Thus if it seemed at first that my responsibility---as responsibility "toward"---simply meant responsibility toward my immediate surrounding, to my "non-I," to my world and thus to my "particular horizon," then it is obviously not entirely true: I am genuinely, fully and reliably responsible for my immediate surrounding only if that responsibility is permeated by, based on and subordinated to responsibility to my "absolute horizon." Any form of clinging to that surrounding as such inevitably ends up as "worldly" utilitarianism.... Ultimately, therefore, even the very absolute horizon of our relating is not something abstract that floats high above the heads of our neighbors, but something we approach through the medium of their disturbing existence.... Another person, in short, is the only entity capable of opening the human heart, in the sense that we have understood that notion over the centuries.*   while "Being"---as the absolute horizon of our relating---is for us---as a "voice" and a "cry"---identical with a moral order (as though Being were not only the "reasoning mind" of everything that exists, but its "heart" as well), the world, or rather existence in it, is a temptation for us to cling in a more complacent fashion (because of indifference to the difficult "voice of Being") to superficialities, immediate aims, details, to adapt ourselves to the flow of phenomena while  giving up on their meaning (leading inevitably to the weakening of one's own Being) . Behind this notion is a sensation of the ambiguity, the instability, the contradictory and paradoxical nature of the human position. *  *from  Letters to Olga , emphasis mine  How can we change without changing? This from a jailed activist, a theologian, a writer. I bow to him.

      I've been reading Fanny Howe:  I was blind until my eyes were opened My heart could feel the clatter & the wind of endless changes, painful drops & voices  Then I saw what I had heard and time grew slow, each lilt a wither Light brought pace & pace brought scatter*  My own writing does not often enough capture the simplicity of verse like this, deceptive simplicity. Here's another sample from Howe:  Huron red, the mist in inner Connecticut as on a wet meadow, clears the distance  Yellow tractors do their job and the purple berry's dye, spills  on a pinch.*  She's marvelous.  *culled from, once again,  Moving Borders: Three Decades of Innovative Writing by Women , ed.

      I've been thinking about the different voices at work in my poems. I feel like it's a reflection of my relationship to contemporary culture: love, hate, dishevel, seek peace, seek war. All these wavelengths that connect & disconnect alternately. I'm not going to apologize for wanting to both emulate speech and yet tighten it. (With a dose of fluidity for the Romantics, to whom I proudly belong also.)   Here's the full second draft of "On the Eighth," which I finished last night &amp; am still puzzling over:    Losing the marimba came easy: It wasn’t in  my mood to rattle the ultimate plating.  Jut of the silver equinox: once a Platonist, soon  not. The inch of ear and fingers declines to say.  The index augments all that is not heliocentric. Who’s to  say which tip burns out on one end? Or the other:  idiosyncratic, hermetic by design. The ulterior rambling.  Nothing lost by these thoughts, just hideaways,  stow-overs, infinities. Risk: it is. On the  eighth ball, the imprint of chalky c-notes. Covering  Massenet’s cabaña, the found ghost, who played him so well.  Two strands of early gut-string, tiddly-winks, guitar-pick style, the pick in the pan. Glyphing radio listeners from over  amber. The man forgot his Tao. What woman  wouldn’t slip into that garden? Momentum appears,  for lovers, an aquatic shadowing. Bodies slip past the    E-N-  D . To stay in one place, slipping the veil over Tuscany.  I wore someone else’s ring for eight years. On our eighth  christening I annihilated the center. Losing it was easy,  then, before the other was an Other. Murmuring came easy  for us: theorists, documentarians. You see me,  on the eighth, running after my watch, ticking along,  you call me  crazy , lost, losing, you do. I’ll drink with anyone,  didn’t you see the empty crush? In comes the cavalry, at the  eighth thought’s crunch. It’s a mess of passive snogging.  Tick and more ticks, the soft slink. Teach me to teach the  gunshots to deflect their targets. Excuses: money, green, the man  made me sign on the line, man. Young again? I’m not so sure.  Age happens with grace/disgrace, depending on timbre and  soot-links. My mother polishes her soot. The rag is  portobello. It’s her manuscript. Mine is in your movie. Losing  on the eighth was less difficult than playing for the bigger bucks.  You rolled big money and fell out of your own pocket.  Who was waiting in the window? We slept that night. My father  called us vanguard for trying to play three low moons upside down.  His images didn’t quite coalesce. How are you gonna make your living,  anyway? I’ll wear your ring for the time it takes to make a baby.  Close three doors for me on your way out. One: Cellophane Wraps  Two: Sleep / Cocoon / Quicksand / Horse’s Hooves / Soft Hair  Three: The Disintegrating Stormy Shadow. On the eighth,  of the fifth, (8 May / tonic? / wholed?)  pa pa pa pa pa pa   “You’re really singing” da capo in the belly---  Take what is left of the loss and file it here:  A) Before you get to the cabinet stop and make sure the over-  turned bottle of indigence is enough to last us for  before you pass the screen cut the hole wide enough to pass  through in case of fire before you curve through before you  break out count the fifths and thirds and divide by three hundred  and then make them all danceable octaves---thin as blanched fourths,  or sixths would be OK---  B) File Under  Straight   C) Mother would tell you a story here, before you get to the porch,  which is creaking under a heavy swing---   It was a cold night, colder  than usual , she begins, and you don’t let her finish, you’re  too busy staring down the muscle-man behind the coat rack, swinging  the flux of your iris over her cashmere pool, ensemble-  like, the eyes are for pairs, the falling man could feel you  real good, the thumping of the bassist’s  dies irae , on the  eighth, not the sixteenth  D) File The Garden With The Socialists & Me. Wear A Black  Turtleneck &amp; I’ll Tune You In Plough & Scythe. With The Right Inch  Of Neck You Can Tell Me Many Slow Stories / Myths With The Right  “I-Know-The-Way-To-The-Subway” Face I’ll Believe You  E)    This loss comes as a story of my own, we’ve all got ‘em  &amp; some of us can’t help but spread the ill. Come near to the blood-  red petal here, the smear of the sun over Zion. You plucked me, love,  out of myself, brief crazy plucked, your personnel time  shodden with the fire-ropes, motion of unwilling workers, unionized  for the brief kiss, hands slipping down the burlap hips & belted  hands breaking under the partisan leveler hands are  reeded &amp; gourded beside the still waters hands are   F) Loss: 4 definitives: Early, Late, Late Before The  Absolute & Rum &amp;, Late After The Sinking Out, Late More Like Coping Under The Willow & Later As In Altarpiece Without The Hollow Sinking    One Last Thing One Last Melodrama Being  That As It May Being As It May Be That As It May Be That  On The Eighth, I Counted In 32nds, Slipping The Pulse In  Under Mother’s Linen Tableskirt, Where I Hid The Birds &amp;  Wires From Destructing   G) it is unable to be defined precisely, because, precisely, it is unable to define itself &, precisely, it is unable to  H) in terms of time:  1) discography, which is never chronological---did  you remember to ask the waitress for some fresh  quarters?

      I am no longer political.   A beautiful story from  urlLink In Communion 's website (Orthodox Christians for Peace):  In 1944, the Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko's mother took him from Siberia to Moscow. They were among those who witnessed a procession of twenty-thousand German war prisoners marching through the streets of Moscow:   The pavements swarmed with onlookers, cordoned off by soldiers and police. The crowd was mostly women---Russian women with hands roughened by hard work, lips untouched by lipstick, and with thin hunched shoulders which had borne half of the burden of the war. Every one of them must have had a father or a husband, a brother or a son killed by the Germans. They gazed with hatred in the direction from which the column was to appear.  At last we saw it. The generals marched at the head, massive chins stuck out, lips folded disdainfully, their whole demeanor meant to show superiority over their plebian victors.  "They smell of perfume, the bastards," someone in the crowd said with hatred. The women were clenching their fists. The soldiers and policemen had all they could do to hold them back.  All at once something happened to them. They saw German soldiers, thin, unshaven, wearing dirty blood-stained bandages, hobbling on crutches or leaning on the shoulders of their comrades; the soldiers walked with their heads down. The street became dead silent---the only sound was the shuffling of boots and the thumping of crutches.  Then I saw an elderly women in broken-down boots push herself forward and touch a policeman's shoulder, saying, "Let me through." There must have been something about her that made him step aside. She went up to the column, took from inside her coat something wrapped in a colored handkerchief and unfolded it. It was a crust of black bread. She pushed it awkwardly into the pocket of a soldier, so exhausted that he was tottering on his feet. And now from every side women were running toward the soldiers, pushing into their hands bread, cigarettes, whatever they had. The soldiers were no longer enemies. They were people.  --- A Precocious Autobiography , Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Collins, London                                                                The anger I've had is always unfounded, even against my own "country." I am ashamed. So much petty talk from my mouth, so much strife in my own smallness.   I've been reading Vaclav Havel's  Letters to Olga . The man is amazing. A quote:  I think the answer is clear: that curious feeling of "responsibility for the world" can probably only be felt by someone who is really (consciously or unconsciously) in touch, within himself, with "the absolute horizon of Being," who communicates or struggles with it in some way, who draws from it meaning, hope and faith, who has genuinely (through inner experience) grasped it.       The majority of the United States has not yet been driven to community. We will only find community & solidarity in poverty. Will this happen?  Je ne sais pas .... This is what frightens those who call themselves Christians but use their faith in the service of their own wealth.   I am not enough spurred to action. But I have been writing. By God's grace may it mean something.  Part of a new poem, a long one, modeled on the incredible Anne Waldman, co-founder with Ginsberg of Naropa's poetics school out in Boulder:  Losing the marimba came easy: it wasn't in my mood to rattle the ultimate plating.  Jut of the silver equinox: once a Platonist, soon not. The inch of ear and fingers declines to say. The index augments all that is not heliocentric. Who's to say what tip burns out on one end? The other, idiosyncratic, hermetic, real by design. The ultimate rambling. Nothing lost by those thoughts: just hideaways, stow-overs, infinities. Risk: it is.                              Another late night. Something must be stirring, which is good. I'm ready to move on, to "shake on through," in the grafted words of Jim Morrison & Michael Stipe. Isn't  Murmur  a great album?

      I've been involved in an interesting conversation over on  urlLink Ron Silliman's Blog . He responded to an e-mail of mine, &amp; there's quite a fun response to it. (A response to a response....) It brings up some interesting questions.  &nbsp;  One question that intrigues me, perhaps more than codification of schools and/or politics of any sort, is the notion of dissidence. I'm an essentialist, a complete Platonist, and (I'm realizing) a more complete pacifist. Not as in  passive , necessarily. But not necessarily  not passive , either.  &nbsp;  Nor am I a Buddhist, or an agnostic. I want this to end with  something . I may know a few things, in the long run. Perhaps I'm enough of a realist (former titles notwithstanding) to realize that the vacillation itself, the struggle, the consciousness, qualifies as a dissidence. What is not done in the service of something/someone/some system, necessarily becomes an independent action, which is unique. I.e./e.g.: Is it "dissident" to carry a sign in a group, &amp; not "dissident" to struggle internally with the decision to react in a particular moment to a particular individual, wanting to maintain an integrity, wanting to feel whole? I'm hokey (&amp; Polonius-esque) enough to believe the latter is dissidence. I don't have a party line, but maybe I'm taking certain things for granted:  &nbsp;   Of course our government is ridiculous! How could an intelligent person not see that?   &nbsp;  Both sides here. Donkeys &amp; elephants. If the Green Party isn't careful, they'll be&nbsp;bearing machinations&nbsp;as well. (Smart move to ditch Nader.)  &nbsp;   Of course codification is ridiculous! Of course art is not as important as hunger! In the large scope of things....   &nbsp;  The job, it seems, of a pacifist is to make&nbsp;the best peace of&nbsp;what is available. Internally (a prerequisite), externally (to the best of his/her ability), &amp;c.  &nbsp;  It may mean going hungry. But not at&nbsp;someone else's expense.  &nbsp;  Not  not passive  as in&nbsp;---  &nbsp;  1. observation  2. soaking  3. allowing  4. strengthening  5.  &nbsp;  It is best to use the sword on oneself. Figuratively, to cut away the dead weight.    You were expecting quietude from me, but I have been writing my own psalm. I've begun carrying nails in my pockets for broadcasting.     Those are my words. These are better:  Only in connection with a body does a shadow make sense. I called mine a dog, the way it ran ahead of me in the dust, breathing rapidly and sticking its small head out in front---though there are intervals where the light stands still, and the air does not resist.*                                   *Rosmarie Waldrop, from  The Reproduction of Profiles , culled from  Moving Borders: Three Decades of Innovative Writing by Women , ed. Mary Margaret Sloan, Talisman House, 1998.

      Of course  Blues and Roots  (Charles Mingus, 1959, available on Rhino) wasn't well-received by the mainsteam jazz community! How could anything that brilliant be well-received?  &nbsp;  The fact that John Coltrane is still to some (albeit very few) a controversial figure shows you how difficult it is for people to  let go ....&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been listening to Pharaoh Sanders. It's impossible to rest the mind, even past 1am, with music this good running through it.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thankfully, some artists have diverse careers, in which they change &amp; grow with themselves, each other, the weather, the political climate, the aesthetic connections they perceive,&nbsp;&amp;c. How could it be otherwise?&nbsp;

      Another late writing night. My deadlines are always far, far ahead of the editors'.   A political issue of  The Mississippi Review , which may singlehandedly redeem the state from its horrible healthcare policies (worse than Georgia's, I believe, which  must be  pretty horrific). The editor of the previous issue encouraged me to submit for this.   I've been listening to my new MAGNET Mag CD. Some fabulous stuff on this one! I'm particularly taken with a band called  urlLink Disclaimer . I'm also really likin' the sweet-sounding  urlLink Reubens Accomplice  & the sexy  urlLink Pipschips&Videoclips . What it is to swoon.... Nice.      Here's the fourth draft of what I hope is overt (do I?) enough for the issue:  Slightly  off to the left—--a bruised face bends in the slant of Capitol & mall—--  no votes fall here, no pock  of slung gun & virile hap.  Mississippi snaps a photo for the file—--   see the green grass : marks the bass line  fiscal ,  lines the indigent  socialists up for coffee.  From the north—--revisionists drop  their arms. A codified pharming.   File under poor : slots of talc  & rattraps. From the underside, flipping  from channel to chain. Off  from the offsters, cough of grass & limination, the rattling teeth shake in meniscus. : Drop a few small minutes / tasks /  in the cusp of us, stone & camouflage; sorry soldier, you  dropped something. Shiny,   manipulative,  off to the side of south,  bird droppings itching out.  It may be a short night of sleep.   I'll leave with a better sample of the type of writing I hope to achieve, from the amazing Eleni Sikelianos's  Earliest Worlds , Coffee House, 2001. This excerpt is from the first book collected therein,  Blue Guide . It's the first part of a poem called "The Brighter Flesh":  Where is the center of human suffering? A tight pit at the pit of the city with the brighter flesh radiating outward. Or inside out, the dark rings around the city moving in and in? At St. Denis? A man by the freeway picks black- berries, and no wood-  lot bloomed without song.  How clear and beautiful---fabulous stuff. I have  so far to go ---thankfully, poetry is a fine bedfellow!

      There are moments when the world ushers in its own expectations. Reading engenders those moments for me, an odd juxtaposition to what we call 'the world' (i.e. the sensual, moving-cloud-in-the-sky  thing ). Perhaps this is why the appearance of a text can affect me so. Other times, though, it hardly matters.   I am always thinking of Bertrand Russell. Perhaps it is because I grew up in a conservative Southern religious environment & was taught (or easily inferred) that his book  Why I Am Not a Christian  is the incarnation of evil.    Reading about Russell's life, I hardly agree. He was a brave & visionary pacifist who happened to be disillusioned by organized religion. (I am as well---not brave & visionary, but disillusioned---though I hope by God's grace that I am a Christian in some respect.)    It is best to be honest. If one is against a mass murder / war, & yet honest in a critique of a "religious" culture that seems to exploit that, &, as with our present administration, commits greater crimes in the name of God than anyone refusing to use his name could do by the negation, then I'm close to calling that person a "saint." We've gotten a bit off track as far as what's "Christian" & what's not. It ought to be a bit more apparent. Unfortunately, nominalism is a real problem (as it always has & probably always will be).  A note from Olivier Clément:  What is wrong is destructive suffering inflicted on others. Wrong must not be returned for wrong. The only thing that counts is shared sympathy....*  I leave with a piece from Russell himself:  Those whose lives are fruitful to themselves, to their friends, or to the world are inspired by hope and sustained by joy: they see in imagination the things that might be and the way in which they are to be brought into existence. In their private relations they are not pre-occupied with anxiety lest they should lose such affection and respect as they receive: they are engaged in giving affection and respect freely, and the reward comes of itself without their seeking. In their work they are not haunted by jealousy of competitors, but are concerned with the actual matter that has to be done. In politics, they do not spend time and passion defending unjust privileges of their class or nation, but they aim at making the world as a whole happier, less cruel, less full of conflict between rival greeds, and more full of human beings whose growth has not been dwarfed and stunted by oppression.**  Today it is close to rain. Last night, at 4am, in a car, it was beginning. It was beautiful.   * from  The Roots of Christian Mysticism , New City, 1993.  ** from  Proposed Roads to Freedom---Anarchy, Socialism and Syndicalism , Henry Holt, 1919.

      I spent some time yesterday getting acquainted with the work of Lorine Niedecker. What a joy! Here's a sample:   Last lines being sentimental, reaction is in the first of the cold. The contemporary scene is, said the green frog by the charcoal wood, false in every particular but no less admirable for that, and isn't it humorous to designate it all?  Here's another sample:   It comes out in March by the back fence, the full and true Relation of the present State of new country and the coming of the world green. Some believed she was immune from such a Thing being they had adopted a youngster in dispare, most persons, you find, peck and pock and seldom really lay any eggs, red though sun set for windy to-morrows. Spring looms also in phonographic deep song on a level with the water  and in spoken acknowledgment of carved humidor so calm what is this woman a man should say: woman.  --both excerpts are from "Progression," culled from Mary Margaret Sloan's anthology  Moving Borders: Three Decades of Innovative Writing by Women , Talisman House, 1998.  Niedecker's work has to me that symbiosis of (or perhaps juxtaposition of) the visual & the theoretic, the sensual & the theoretic, perhaps. It is, of course, carried out by her swimmingly amazing ear.  One more piece from "Progression":   Meanwhile surviving burial and the garden with too many tall stones entails backroads, berries and what is socialism. If I had two pigs, said the farmer, and you hadn't any, I'd have to give you one, said the gardener and, fist to mahogany, no more petals would fall from the silver vased red poppy than enough.  A fitting commentary both on Niedecker's blossoming time & our own expired one.

      Ideally, I'd like to have something to say most every time I post here. However, I'm of the opinion that most everything wonderful & worth reading has been said previously, & I may be pulling from others' words most of the time.   About me:  1. Politically, I'm a democratic socialist who is pro-life on three fronts: abortion, war, & capital punishment. I support economic reforms that ultimately are life-saving. I support the protection of the environment. I am especially interested in animal rights campaigning. I'm not quite politically-minded enough to see past the human equation in terms of policy &c., but I try to be well-informed & consistent. I tend to find that my interests coincide more with human rights organizations & pacifist religious organizations than with any particular political party. I am indeed an independent in this respect.  2. Artistically, I have many interests. I study poetry writing in graduate school. I have studied music & feel perhaps more proficient in that art form because of the intense pragmatic approach to its formal training. My academic interests (which are necessarily artistic ones, according to my definition of academic) lie in the congruity between art forms. In this respect I am holistic. I am a bit dismayed by the specialization in our universities that precludes experimentation.  3. As a poet, I'm always trying to find writing that both soothes and enervates. Perhaps what moves me most about a piece of writing is its energy. Energy + language + risk = , to me, the beginnings of a solid voice, a voice I want to believe & turn to again. However, it's hard to codify poetry! (Thank God for this!) If I had to come up with a word for what I love, I'd call myself an imagistic transcendentalist / subtitled: lango-pacifist. (What an ugly series of sounds!) I do tend to write by ear, so perhaps it's best just to refer to oneself as a  callista  or  callistos , one of the most aurally pleasing words (with a fabulous meaning). I take great pleasure in poetry's connection to music & speech, & also to philosophy. I'm not quite visually oriented enough, though certain visual-word-images resonate with me: i.e. "blue," the title (partial) of this blog, becomes a particular sound & sense also attached to a visual. I could continue, but think I'm becoming didactic & pedantic here.  I leave with a section of Ginsberg's  Howl , one of my favorites in the above respects:   I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an     angry fix, angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the  starry dynamo in the machinery of night, who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the   supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz, who bared their brains to Heaven....

      Now that I know people are actually reading this, I'm going to have to choose a focus (Or Am I)? It's a Bit Intimidating---but fortunately, the mask is still On---  You should (all?) know that this is the umpteenth blog I've tried, because I spent a good month deciding on a name, which I'm still undecided on. (I love retractable publications!)  1. Confessions of an American Dissident (this was first an AOL journal, & then I found the lovely blogspot) (hence the URL---dissidentspeak.blogspot.com)  2. Veneration? / Amber Waves? / (Dissident Speak)  3. some various Odd &amp; Sundry names: "I Have Almost," &c. (me trying to pick the perfect Peck of Pickled Peppers, though the color would certainly be either Blue or Black, minima)  4. Blue Revisions (I like this because it cops a poem title ("Blue"), from which I cull this most interesting line of my early (and perhaps later---who Knows Where Fate Leads?) writing life: "This blue rock fosters the pacifist.")  I intended this blog to be political but have decided that my head is not in politics (though my heart is in its uncontrollable consequences), which is why I would be an inherently dangerous &amp; endangered President (my 7th-grade math teacher told me he thought I would become "the first woman president").  Howard Zinn has an interesting book called  Artists in Times of War , and it provides an illuminating historical precedent for those of us who care to understand the 20th century.    It is time to shift gears & tackle the submission question. I'm always concerned when folks are worried (over-worried, usually) about publishing. I told my creative writing students to always remember that there is a little Hobbit in Middle Earth who is writing poems better than  anything  we will ever write, &amp; that no one will  ever read them . A student I later came to look to for inspiration & intellectual "Keeping-The-Teacher-On-Her-Toes" pulled a ring out from under his shirt. This was, of course, right after the second installment of  LOTR  came out, right in the heat of the wave of it. But I think the point is a good one.      Today I got two literary mail items (&amp; another "check" from CitiBank, trying to get me to order some silly insurance): Paul Hoover's  Post-Modern American Poetry  and a copy of a nameless journal in which one of my poems is featured. I was immediately ashamed & shoved the journal in my purse while walking Viola to "doggie play group" at the park in late afternoon. I almost threw it away. I reluctantly updated my "vita." (It is not, however, my  life , which, true to the meaning of  vita , is rather different and more likely found in a riff of an early R.E.M. song or something.)      So. I feel the same way when sending stuff out. I have an immediate regret. I feel "productive" & am usually spontaneous abot it, &amp; then, the "morning after," I re-read the submission & hope the editors aren't guffawing or yawning (guffawing might not be too bad, actually). Maybe I just want some feedback. Maybe I'm subconsciously trying to humble myself by putting my unfinished work out there. Maybe I just love going to the post office (this is actually the Hot Seat on the Ballot right now). It's a curious test of an editor. Or a first-line reader. When I was reading for  Five Points , I was often surprised at the second-rate work that came in from writers I was familiar with. Why not make a Stunning Debut? Or a Stunning Second Debut? Or a Stunning Third? I don't know. I suppose perfectionism has its downside, but in this line of working &amp; playing it probably has more perks than not. I once suggested in workshop "waiting five more years" (I'd been writing---loosely speaking---for four years at the time, last spring) to publish & was immediately shut down. Not a good "professional strategy," I suppose. But worth considering.    Enough about me. This was meant to be Compassionate but here I Come Again with my Pity.  The "R.E.M. Sampler" CD I made myself: 1. Try Not to Breathe, from  Automatic for the People  2. Sweetness Follows, from  Automatic for the People  3. There She Goes Again, from  Dead Letter Office  4. The Voice of Harold, from  Dead Letter Office  5. Stumble, from  Dead Letter Office  6. King of Birds, from  Document  (a song I'd like to cover with my wispy lyric mezzo voice distorting vowels & playing the consonants---Licorice) 7. Feeling Gravitys Pull from  Fables of the Reconstruction   8. Driver 8, from  Fables of the Reconstruction  9. Green Grow the Rushes, from  Fables of the Reconstruction   10. Wendell Gee, from  Fables of the Reconstruction  11. You Are the Everything, from  Green  12. The Flowers of Guatemala from  Lifes Rich Pageant  13. Sitting Still, from  Murmur  ( kallisto --- 14. Shaking Through, from  Murmur  ( kallistos --- 15. Electrolite, from  New Adventures in Hi-Fi   16. Me in Honey, from  Out of Time  (the first album whose release I anxiously awaited, right before spring break of my 9th grade year) (I want to  be  Kate Pierson, still---remember the great Iggy Pop duet  Candy ?) 17. I've Been High, from  Reveal  (I first heard this song when I hadn't  really  listened to pop music for some time---I was re-democratized--- happily happily so--- it was Pentecost Sunday!--- 18.  Hope, from  Up  (the name of one of my patron saints--- Esperanza ---  "You want to trust the doctors that procedure is the best, but the last try was a failure, and the intern was a mess. And they did the same to Matthew, and he bled till Sunday night...."---from the last song, the Last Word---  Peace. L.

      I had prepared to draft an essay (a brief) here on the correlation between Stevens and Ivan Karamazov (I'm not feeling charitable). I may reserve this line of thought (which veers into Russian religious aesthetics) for later.  I was going to talk about how Christianity is not a "culture," as Stevens asserts.  I was also going to talk about aristocracy & democracy, as Auden does.  I was going to compare Stevens &amp; Pound with Salvador Dalí & talk about how Pound &amp; Dalí represent a madness that is redemptive, a leaping off one side of the boat that implies that the other side exists. I was going to talk about how Stevens smells of fish & the leatherette pilot's chair.  But then---  μεταφορα  transfer of energy (not "meaning from one thing to another")---μεταφορα appears on Greek trucks &amp; means "transfer"---we assume a "metaphor" must mean that  x  is  y  (and extend this to a faulty extent---Extend/Extent----&c.)---another pet peeve---  [Why did I make my students buy that darned creative writing textbook? I never used one in composition class....]  The Point:  Here comes someone with more "breathing room" than the Poetry Editor for  Atlantic Monthly !  ---  Charles Olson must have a Music Background (though I know nothing of him). My time spent wanting to pursue 17th-century English poetry and later Irish poetry has left me in a place where I'm writing out of intuition without finding models.  Here's one more to add to the list!  ---  OK---an observation: not mine (thankfully):  the poem itself must, at all points, be a high energy-construct and, at all points, an energy-discharge. So: how is the poet to accomplish same energy, how is he, what is the process by which a poet gets in, at all points energy at least the equivalent of the energy which propelled him in the first place, yet an energy which is peculiar to verse alone and which will be, obviously, also different from the energy which the reader, because he is a third term, will take away?  ---C. O., from  Projective / Verse   The working out of this answer is waiting USE.  As a singer, I find this especially instructive. There's an implicit audience in a singing rehearsal, but none so with poetry. The writer is the reader, the audience, at least initially. But I do feel, and I'm not entirely  naive , just partially, that a movement of breath (the foundation of all good singing---so much more important than talking about tone, which will come if breath is strong, or posture, which is sometimes delineated though each person stands differently naturally &amp;c) automatically guarantees a reader,  somewhere , at some present or future time. Which is why publication doesn't matter. Unless you want a job. We all know this dilemma. I was drafting, mentally, a post on "submitting," but then I read Olson.  μεταφορα μεταφορα μεταφορα  ΚΑΛΛΙΣΤΩΣ  PostScript---he talks about the circulation of the breath (it's really all we can do with it---it comes &amp; goes)---Joni Mitchell talks about "circulating [his] soul around"---this is, ultimately, a "religious" (better definitions needed of this, for sure!) concept---I'm Not The One To Tell It---try Fr. Schmemann--- For the Life of the World , preface (St Vladimir's Seminary P-->link to the right)---  I have a New Preceptor, second only to ...  ssshhh

      I am in love with this beautiful avant-gospel music out of Sumter, Alabama.  Currently the project is sold out, but check out  urlLink teamrecords.org  for future updates.  From their site:   Every aspect of the project aims to present a loose, freewheeling composite of the spirit of a unique place. The packaging was handmade with Amos Kennedy, a local letterpress printer and creator of York Show Print and the Ala-Miss Book Arts project. In addition to the recording, Hyatt created a unique environment for listening in The Coleman Center's Art Gallery. Using just-processed raw cotton, he shaped the billowy white bunches into cloud formations, which float through the exhibition space among electronics, microphones, and an antique piano.  After viewers navigate through the mess they can settle into a church pew set in front of the piano where they will see on each of the exposed hammers (all 88 of them) a small portrait of each member of this mythical band, The Clouds. That's right, eighty-eight people sing and play together on this CD, and just as their portraits dance in harmony as each chord is played on the piano, so do their lives intersect in Sumter County Alabama.  The project is non-profit.  Hart Crane, my new crush (new / old --- I'm reading him in a new way lately):   in poetry the  rationale  of metaphor belongs to another order of experience than science, and is not to be limited by a scientific and arbitrary code of relationships either in verbal inflections or concepts. ---from a Letter to Harriet Monroe   "Compass, quadrant and sextant contrive no farther tides." ---from "At Melville's Tomb"    Crane follows Eliot's lead to its natural conclusion. For this I applaud them both. Chronology notwithstanding. It's interesting how vision supersedes time.

        I'm up to W. C. Williams in my poetics readings, so I'm gonna be real earthy here. The retired Writing Center Director (dear, sweet Dr. Graves) told me she went to church with a man who had / has? a scar on his head with the craftsman's signature (not literally). I wonder how many older folks out there remember Dr Williams as a doctor....  How I Write:      Find a poem with an interesting form.     Write out the syllabics of the form.     Fill in the blanks.    This works with prose-poems, too. Just count the lines of text.  This way I don't get discouraged & overwhelmed with where a poem is going.  I may be stuck in this emulation for Ever---Quite a While.  How I Choose Words: pop music, PBS, the Internet, other poems, mis-types*  *If I write "vernal" where I meant "verbal" I consider keeping it. Subconscious slip of the hand.  The incessant typing satisfies my pianist hands in this pianoless stage of my life.  Keys / letters are Close to Being the Same!       Your Scholar, L.

        Direct treatment of the “thing” whether subjective or objective.   To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation.   As regarding rhythm: to compose in the sequence of the musical phrase, not in sequence of a metronome.   ---from Pound's  Retrospect   My words: Because I believe the ear is the word of choice, I believe the metronomic is only sequential so far as it is metronomic, the silvery tick of the bone. The Sequence Is Calculated & Unmusical---the word is the ear, to be married by the humidor (see previous post on Lorine Niedecker).  The word that does not contribute is a contribution. It is the Natural Ebb &amp; Run. Compression? Only for the carburetor.   E. P., I am your pupil in most ways---  I am however the most humanistic of the Imagists---  Your Scholar, L---

       To present an image (hence the name “Imagist”). We are not a school of painters, but we believe that poetry should render particulars exactly and not deal in vague generalities, however magnificent and sonorous. It is for this reason that we oppose the cosmic poet, who seems to us to shirk the real difficulties of his art.  ---from Amy Lowell's Preface to  Some Imagist Poets   My response: I am Imagist & also not so---I am Imagist & Ear-bound Song. The difficulty of the art lies in the Being. Yes, the being of not being a revisionist. But I am now a revisionist of Revisionism---I do not count the stops & ticks, I only draw them in---  How difficult it is to counter the real with the Real!

      What is poetics? My poetry itself, I think, while wholly derived from emulation (is not language itself an emulation? I've never understood the "three-word" plagiarism rule), is necessarily a commentary on my poetics. Every formulaic critical paper I've written has been about this. Seamus Heaney & The  Glanmore Sonnets , the liminality of his particular life & "digging" into writing; The Lady of Shalott & that godawful mirror; &c. Perhaps I feel unfit to write Freudian critiques of other writers' sexual desires. Perhaps I will not pretend to understand Lacan. (Did he understand himself?) Perhaps it will always always be Derridean for all of us (since we're brought up to think that way. I wonder what Derrida thinks of Derrida. He is supposedly a kind man who drives a Kia). Do I need more than this? How much 'poetical' thinking is enough? How much veers into the Great Question without an Answer. I will always, maybe it is only because I am religious, refer to  The Cloud of Unknowing , even though it's Roman and I'm supposedly Byzantine/Moscowian. (Is Moscowian a word? It has less the effect of Antiochian, which is inherently beautiful ( callisto/kallisto )). Why do we transliterate Greek with  c 's instead of  k 's at times? I've always wondered that. I do it, to feel more like I'm romancing the languages or Cataloning. But a Kappa is a Kappa, &c. My Greek teacher never addressed this, I suppose because our Greek script was so much more interesting to discuss. Is transliteration possible? No. After reading both Plato & Aristotle in Greek, I'm convinced that any discussion of them is (or  ought  to be) intrinsically bound to their use of language: Plato is lyrical, Aristotle more muscular. Their worlds were, however, so very very very similar. The Greek language affords liberties that we don't understand in English. But the mind is one. It's wonderful. If I had 14-hour free spells I'd study more often. It took me many hours to begin thinking & writing in Greek with some fluency, some whole Sundays. The Mind is One!  I'm so hesitant to delineate myself, but here the poetics come, again!  (Note: Moscowian being lesser, as I insinuated, is no slight to the Russian Church. I was simply trying to create an adjective around a single city---Russia is diverse & its cities ManyFold.)  The Poetics Begin in Hiatus.     As previously established here & elsewhere, I am no cynic. I refuse to speak about poetry in the ubiquitous "one" here. No Lies.  Energy: as in Music. The Energy of One Private Letter to the unseen Lover.   Each 32nd note is two 64th notes. Each 64th notes is two (mind the math!) 128th notes, and so on to Infinity. Each letter, each morpheme, each syllable, is an Infinite Number of Motions, sweeping---under nothing. Sweeping over & around the heart / noesis / the Great Eye.  I write "by ear," because I have great pain of ear & less pain of eye.  The sound of the word "humidor" (employed beautifully by Lorine Niedecker in "Progression") is as intriguing as the image it evokes (visual); my Humidor is an arrogant box in the closet. I can't quite see it.   How Faulty to Revise More Than 3X!   with a quick sweep of the ear the world becomes illuminate & shifts from Bflatmajor7 to Csharpminor in perfect progression  The Poem will Never Equal the beauty of Handel's "Care Selve" (del mio cor---the high pitch---the sail) or the 2nd Alleluia of Arvo Pärt's Berliner Messe---If There Is Beauty as this in Poems, I Am not able to continue  I do not pretend to enjoy Wallace Stevens.  There is no such thing as being perfectly in tune, ever, but it is advisable for me to try to aim (OK---here I'll generalize---for  all  to try to aim) for the   center of the pitch    the strength of Length Lies in its Sustainability? NO! How many letters make a Pentagon Paper? how many are needed for beauty---how much pain in the weeping Eye? how many vowels together are meaningful simply for openness's sake? Not Quite Enough---we are lucky English speakers, are we not guttural?  The poem must reach at stealing sounds in pastiche. These sounds must be stealable. The poem must combine (as in food combining---hokey, huh?) the poet & the poet's world. If the poet is a poet, the poem is a poem. I have believed this from an early stage as a musician & find that it bears well. (Confession: I've always hated Elizabeth Schwarzkopf's voice, loved Callas's though it pinches)   Good Morning, Saturday.   The rules of trees: Don't Bend The Double Crouch If Inflection Thinks Around The Diffusion. I've had it before. I'll stay diffused.  If I were a musician, I would not have to over-think. I am almost Perfectly Convinced that Poetry ought to follow the same rules. If I were to Pontificate along Lines of Steel-thinking, I would lose the curiosity of All Normal People.   Chomsky: "what's valued here is the ability to work on an assembly line, even if it's an intellectual assembly line." (from  Understanding Power , seminal discussions with the great man)  We Americans are too dang Disciplined for Our Own Goods!

      Have you ever been so sure  you were sure  you were sure you are never sure  Why did you revise your life away, Walt?  ***  M. Stevens, you were a  man .  ***  Do not tell me that the cabin stands deserted on the beach. Tell me that it moves. The cabin should have moved. If the cabin had moved, I would not have sold your Poems to buy my bread.  ***  You were only one season. I would like to have seen four or four thousand.  ***  My words to you: I introduce them your way: they are words: they are more than words: they are:    O Eyes---Revolve Away! Sharpen Yourselves On The Bloom & Rescued Fire!

       "writers have begun to dwell upon the element of evocation, of suggestion, upon what we call symbolism in great writers"---WB Yeats, 1900  Reply: I cannot decide how to address you. (I am in second-person automatically, however, and cannot avoid  you .) I'm not chasing you. Am I? Are YOU a symbol? Is YOU a symbol? Is the small "y" a symbol for---the large "Y" a different sort?   I have lost the desire to pursue anything but dialectic. Defined as: Discourse With Image & Word. This Is Maybe Not Entirely Religious.  Do My Concepts Evoke & Suggest In You? (you--YOU--YoU--yOu--YOu--yOU)  With Hopkins, I assert: My Poetry Errs on the Side of Oddness.   It was always to be expected!  My aesthetic is such: (i really don't want it to be odd)  ***  Having said the above, or written it (written it? said it?)  the following:  I dug the preordained Spot Of Water. I hung the Silver Bucket Over The Disembodied Tarp.

      Will Alexander's "Alchemy as Poetic Kindling":    One commences the poetic quest with a thirst for illuminate language, as if one had been branded in the womb, with the anti-linear condensed in the image. And I am not speaking of an affected, self-appointed heroics, condoned by escapist grammar, but conviction, burning like a phantom mesmerism, always calling one home to the fruit of one's bones. ..... An imagination, pre-cluded against contamination, where one could imagine a slaughter house producing arisen angelics, or imagine a gryphon atop boulders staring out into a magically crafted dawn of magenta. ..... And it is in this rising when mesmerism becomes synecdoche and spillage, where the words take on a butane colour, in constant orphic transmutation.... Therefore, the ambiguity thrills, and opens up the reader to constant illuminant spiralling throughout a duration of simultaneous transparencies. ..... And I'll always remember my first encounter with Bob Kaufman, at an angle on a street in North Beach, wordless in his phantom movements, like the silence of an alchemical crucible. The nutrients inside his skull like interior flashing muscles, his seismically arched back beneath fables of sonar.*   *from  Primary Trouble: An Anthology of Contemporary Poetry , eds. Schwartz, Donahue, Foster, Talisman House, 1996.  From now on I ought to fully devote my energies to poetry. I've been half-assed: writing a lot without fully explicating why. I promised a poetics at some point, so I'll begin. Now. Thanks, jlo, for the good discussion.

       Thus, in that inevitable taking of sides which comes from selection and emphasis in history, I prefer to tell the story of the discovery of America from the viewpoint of the Arawaks, of the Constitution from the standpoint of the slaves, of Andrew Jackson as seen by the Cherokees, of the Civil War as seen by the New York Irish, of the Mexican war as seen by the deserting soldiers of Scott’s army, of the rise of industrialism as seen by the young women in the Lowell textile mills, of the Spanish-American war as seen by the Cubans, the conquest of the Philippines as seen by black soldiers on Luzon, the Gilded Age as seen by southern farmers, the First World War as seen by socialists, the Second World War as seen by pacifists, the New Deal as seen by blacks in Harlem, the postwar American empire as seen by peons in Latin America.*   .....  I am supposing, or perhaps only hoping, that our future may be found in the past’s fugitive moments of compassion rather than in its solid centuries of warfare.*  *from Howard Zinn's  A People's History of the United States , highly recommended reading (I'm always re-reading this one)

      I've used the word 'enervate' on this blog several times, I think. I meant 'innervate' instead. Thanks, jlo.  For those who are interested, 'enervate' means to deplete energy, 'innervate' means to rile up energy.   I'm listening to old 10,000 Maniacs today. Jangle-pop,  ahhh .  An excerpt from a poem that went over well at the Rome reading at Harvest Moon (in the upper room with Jess, Sara & Sara last month (or was it June?)).   My father is a smart man. When he closes his eyes he pictures my mother holding a toucan at Disney World, & a deep sorrow pierces his heart. I think of my mother as a young Yvonne DeCarlo, or a hip Donna Reed. My mother thinks of herself as a giant womb, unable to see its feet well enough to cross rivers. She carefully matches her shoes to her sweaters to avoid this. Somehow, if colors match, better things will happen. I wore my green sweater & carried my Costa Rican purse once, & I felt awkward that day. However, a rustling man helped me onto the train, though he did not shelter me once on board. I was afraid, so afraid that I played with my lighter in front of a woman with two babies in a stroller. That man followed me to the bus stop, but the bus driver’s uniform frightened him. Bus drivers always wear one color, always the almost-police-officer look. The next day I bought a long navy dress & was venerated by a flock of geese.   .....  I listen to jangle-pop/rock & ride the subway, which is decorated with weeping sculptures & the Vietnam Wall. There is a close-up of me putting on lipstick & writing a poem about the government.

      I'm still reading Chomsky:  When a state carries out aggression, its propaganda system has the responsibility to justify the act and suppress the reasons for it in favor of acceptable pretexts.... The radically different reactions are readily explained by the doctrine that the US alone enjoys the right of lawless violence..... The basic doctrine is that the state can do no wrong (apart from tactical misjudgment, an excess of benevolence, personal failings, and the like); it is the enemies of the state who are fundamentally evil.... a dominant theme of the doctrinal system has been that the traditional benevolence and humanity of US foreign policy is now enhanced by an even-more-passionate-than-usual commitment to democracy.  from  Letters from Lexington   I am about to finish watching an old movie called  The Philadelphia Story . Today I quit my job to pursue life outside an office.

       There are all sorts of filtering devices to get rid of people who are a pain in the neck and think independently. Those of you who have been through college know that the educational system know that the educational system is very highly geared to rewarding conformity and obedience; if you don't fit the mold, you are a troublemaker.  from  Letters from Lexington: Reflections on Propaganda , rev. 2004, Paradigm Publishers  Can you blame people for 'hating' school? Where does 'school' really happen? Maybe we should ask Robert Frost. (He wasn't particularly interested in school either.)

      I'm looking forward to the new semester. It's wonderful just to be  around  other writers. As averse as I can be to studying art forms (which sometimes leads to uniformity), I think the social aspect is unbeatable.  I'm enrolled in Social & Political Philosophy but may drop it, simply because it's more fun to learn on my own (a good read tells most truths about itself).  Here's the rest of the poem that's been in progress for  too  long:  Take me on directly. This is my Letter Of Resignation. From the sole to the soul again. My mother always told me to man the stops with the right toe forward. I listened, breathless, pinching my own unautomated arm.    Great Power , I’m resigning from your coalition.   Tell me you didn’t pinch the white man. (Pinch me instead.) I’ll vote for the man in the white suit this time, & next time I’ll pick the black-suited man. In eighteen years it will be the vote that motivates me to help you arm your military. Together we can balance a good budget this way. Don’t scream. You might find yourself looking at my gun. I can talk like you, I can talk it all up.   Salve for the salver—I’m serving your disposition. Ostensible: me sleeping on your tavern floor. Grant me my own constitution to live by. I Hold My Truth To Be Your Evidence. It’s too late for me to be deceived by your grey suit.    You’ve left me talking to myself again. I used to have Insurance To Prevent This Kind Of Thing From Happening. In night dreams I watch the red rocks crumble into a hurricane of ash, making their ways up my coast. How many times it happened without me watching, I don’t know, maybe only a quarter of a century’s moon-droppings, maybe only a half-century’s kisses, in between.   Every morning I kiss you before you are awake. You release your white ibis into my mouth. Three dilations, in small circles, as he swallows the bottom of my educable services. He has fleas, odd for a bird, but sensate & flipped-out, like me. I forage for him, sometimes, when the light is low over the marina. He has long hairs, strokers, whiskery feathers, tinged with my footprints & your saliva.   The ibis (let’s call him Junker) always did What He Was Told. He Was Told Many Things by Many Erudite People Until He Died in My Washer. He Believed for Many Years That He Was an Ostrich. Once a Peacock Brushed by Him & He Felt the Free Motion of Tanglement & Spam.

      I'm reading Noam Chomsky's  American Power and the New Mandarins , originally published in 1967 & revised two years later, in 1969. It's fascinating & still relevant.   These various factors---access to power, shared ideology, professionalization---may or may not be deplorable in themselves, but there can be no doubt that they interact so as to pose a serious threat to the integrity of scholarship in fields that are struggling for intellectual content and are thus particularly susceptible to the workings of a kind of Gresham's law.

      I am realizing how much I run my mouth when I shouldn't. It burns in the breast.   By entering into the arena of argument and counterargument, of technical feasibility and tactics, of footnotes and citations, by accepting the presumption of legitimacy of debate on certain issues, one has already lost one's humanity.... The war is simply an obscenity, a depraved act by weak and miserable men, including all of us, who have allowed it to go on and on with endless fury and destruction---all of us who would have remained silent had stability and order been secured.  Noam Chomsky, from  American Power and the New Mandarins , 1969 (rev.)  I know why I've never been attracted to a man in a uniform.

      Tear it down. There are no walls in Vietnam. Where once the boards met, where once the arches formed, where once the houses collapsed under rain, where once the thickness called,  where once it was a choice. No hat required  for the burning job—--the burning man disappears, the wall released from its job, and the forest, and the whole of forests, and the country,  and the whole of countries, in the service  of the wall, the wall, the wall.

       Polls show that almost half the population believe that the U.S. Constitution---a sacred document---is the source of Marx's phrase "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need," so obviously right does the sentiment seem.

       A friend, a young Asian scholar, visiting a tiny island near Okinawa a few months ago, stopped at the home of a farmer who had become the leader of a struggle to free their land from military domination---the movement a curious blend of Christianity and traditional beliefs with a strong populist strain. On a wall, he noticed a poster in Japanese which read: "Which road is the correct one, which is just? Is it the way of Confucius, of the Buddha, of Jesus Christ, Gandhi, Bertrand Russell? Or is it the way of Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, Hitler, Mussolini, Napoleon, Tojo, President Johnson?"  from  Problems of Knowledge and Freedom: The Russell Lectures , Noam Chomsky, The New Press, 1971
