      Well, my girl loves Freddy.  We all love Freddy. But only she woke up at 5:30 this morning to pet Freddy. And only she kept petting Freddy for the next six hours.  And only she got growled at when she tried to pick him up to carry him to his blanket. He looked up at me over her shoulder during one of her many hugs with his saddest, help me please eyes.  Poor baby. She really is very gentle with him, but I'd want to bite her too if she was on top of me, arranging my paws and giving me toys every other minute.  Here's another shot of Fred

      We're gluttons for punishment. We have a big ole black lab who loves to sleep on anything but the floor and now we're picking up a beagle I spied at the shelter.  Wasn't really in the market for a 10 year old beagle, but hey, who could resist?  Actually, the best part is he may be 12 or he may be 6. The shelter guy had no idea. Here's my boy     Hey, just tried the picture thing and I'm pretty proud of myself. Off to the shelter....  Well here is the new guy. His name is Freddy, they're guessing six years old.  I am guessing deaf.  He doesn't seem to hear a thing!      LOVE HIM!!

      So. What to say. Got two kids 7 and 3 and one husband. So..three kids it is. Work a little bit. Read a little bit. My son is finishing up first grade. Very mouthy. Every bit his mother. But, all in all a good kid. Daughter is a whirlwind. Wicked tempermental, cannot make up her mind to save her life, but gives a million kisses a day.  Mostly mommy stuff here.  That's what I do mostly.  Working part time, mostly from home is great. Except when it's really sunny and hot out and who wants to go to work at 7:30 at night?

      Well, we're off to Maine for four days of camping with the kids and the dogs. We own some land up there with my parents and we're going to hang out up there, do the local thing (swim at the town beach, etc...) and put some work into the driveway to the permanent spot we want to put our camper/future building site for a small cabin. We totally love going up there, no electricity, campfires, dirty kids...the good life. More when I get back.   urlLink    Here's a picture of our brook with some fallen trees.&nbsp; urlLink

      Well, the conjunctivitis was no better today, so I figured who better to infect than a bunch of strangers at the aquarium. It was jammed with people and parking costs a fortune ($28.00 for two and a half hours!!) but my son's class has just finished a huge ocean lesson at school (and I got a nice discount pass from the library) and I thought it was a good way to add to it. Sadly, the aquarium hasn't changed all that much in years.  It needs a good update. Although the kids really love the round coral reef tank that goes right down the middle of the building from the top floor to the bottom.     urlLink    Lunch with a wild bunch&nbsp; urlLink

      I know, yuck. But too bad. This is the first time anyone of us has had this eye goop so I felt like sharing. Here we are at the doctor's office      That's my son's eye. It doesn't look nearly as bad as it does in person.     I work one day a week and today, the longest most beautiful day here in New England, I go into the office before I remember that the girl I work for was taking the day off and told me that I could have it off too. DAMN, DAMN, DAMN! So I put in one good hour and took off. My girl was already at the baby sitters so I read, ate a quiet lunch, pet my doggies and off to the babysitter's. Then I got the phone call and the mad rush to the doctor's so I can get the prescription so he can take the medicine twice before bed so he doesn't miss the last day of school. AAAHHH- relaxation at it's finest.

      Here's a little something for all of you who are getting hyped up (or not) for the big presidential race .... urlLink Wish you could take a swing at either guy?  Try that.  We have the big Democratic Convention coming to town in a few weeks and apparently they figured that this would bring millions of dollars in revenue to the great city of Boston. What the brilliant planners forgot to figure was that, in having to shut the entire town down for a few days, it was going to cost approximately one third of their "revenue" in lost money. Good thinking. And quite literally, they are shutting down major highways and access roads into Boston. What a mess. I truly feel for those people whose bosses won't let them take a few days in the sun.

        Forrest Gump!    urlLink   What movie Do you Belong in?(many different outcomes!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Okay, I found this quiz on  urlLink Words of Mikey  and thought I'd give it a try. Forest Gump??!?!? Sweet irony.  I think I am the last person in the free world who has not (and will not) see this movie. There are a few movies that just totally do zilch for me and then years go by and it seems as if everyone has seen them and I just won't based on principal (and complete lack of interest).  1.  Forest Gump 2.  Titanic 3.  Shawshank Redemption 4.  My big fat Greek wedding  I know number three is questionable because apparently it was really good, but I've made it this long and now I can't break the spell. And now I find out my true calling is to be in a movie where I would be a man who has never aged mentally after, say, the THIRD GRADE?? Super. Run Jenny Run. G'nite.

      Sorry all I keep posting are pictures of the kids and the dogs.  Maybe that's not totally true, but it seems that way to me.  They're just easy marks for the camera. We went to our friend's boy's birthday party tonight and in the goodie bags were little squirt guns.  Well, because my daughter is only three she didn't make the cut and got bubbles.  Far be it for that to stop her from soaking her dad.  She sticks her whole face in the pool, takes in a big mouthful of water and spits it all over him. SURPRISE! Makes a mother proud. Only sixty nine days of summer vacation left. Oh, and we brought Freddy to the vet. It's official --- 11-12 years old and probably deaf with a heart murmur (which the kind doctor told me would most likely lead to congenital heart failure). Poor guy. Now he's allowed to sleep on the furniture.   urlLink    The monkey bars at our friend's son's birthday party.&nbsp; urlLink

      Any other  urlLink NETFLIX  lovers out there?  I love it. No video store with my kids rearranging the shelves and fighting to watch a totally horrible or inappropriate movie. No late charges because I never even drive by the stinking video store on my way to anywhere...Sound like a commercial??  Well, sorry but it really is awesome.  Some favorite movies I've seen recently: City of God, Kill Bill, The Quiet American, Reservoir Dogs, Rabbit Proof Fence.  Okay, on to Mondays. Don't like them. But for some god forsaken reason I volunteered to work on Mondays.  The kids babysitter is my husband's aunt and she lives 23 minutes away and I work about 1/2 mile from my house. So I drive 45 minutes for a commute that really could take 5. The best part is I really like my job. Monday's are  four office hours they've offered me (aside from my regular job of attending meetings and taking minutes) and I figured that I should take them just to keep my future options open.

      Well, it started off with a bang. Literally. Thirty minutes into the trip we rear ended a car on the Expressway in Boston. It was very minor and no one was hurt, thankfully, but the reason behind the entire accident was that my dear husband was pointing out a big dump truck from the company he works for to my daughter...."Look Honey, a truck..." SMASH. Now, he only sees about 150 of these trucks every day at the job site, but I digress.    urlLink    The damage.&nbsp; urlLink

      Don't underestimate the importance of this blue bag. The picture was taken after we returned home because it sat forgotten in the bathroom all weekend long. Now, alone this would have been enough to really get me stressed, having to stop to replace the essentials and getting all worked up over what I can't replace (son's antibiotic for the lovely conjunctivitis), but after the accident, it didn't seem so major. Please, scroll down. :)   urlLink    The all important (and totally forgotten) bag.&nbsp; urlLink

      Well, we pull into a Rite Aid to pick up the all important toothpaste, etc. when my husband doesn't quite make the turn and blows out the right wheel of the popup. Bends up the rim and kabloowey. The spare didn't have any air in it so our friend who followed us up (and almost rear ended us in the first accident) pumped it up and they put it on and we were off...   urlLink    The blowout.&nbsp; urlLink

      Here's my son in the same site. All in all, it really was a good trip. The kids had a blast, totally covered in dirt. We took icy showers in the woods and cooked our dinner over the campfire. It did end up raining all day Saturday, but we went to a Family Festival in Augusta that day. Camping is a relatively inexpensive way to have fun with the family. Here's what it cost for us to camp this weekend  $500.00 in missed overtime work $ 31.00 spare tire $100.00 gasoline (although the prices seem to be coming down) $ 55.00 Rite Aid replacements $500.00 Insurance deductable if we want to fix the truck  So for only $1,186.00 you too can have a stressful, rainy weekend with the family, no food, water or electricity included!!   urlLink    The future campsite!!&nbsp; urlLink

      Friday was the evening of my eagerly anticipated book club meeting.  I say eagerly anticipated because A. We only meet every six weeks.  B. Usually we have good snacks.  C. We really have a blast together. We're all moms and most of us don't hang out together outside of this group, but we've all become friends and spend a lot of time laughing and commiserating.   Anyway, I had to enlist a babysitter because my husband and son are in Maine.  I also had to enlist the service of my good friend (and book clubber) to stay at my house while I brought said babysitter home.  Now, it's 12:10a.m., barely a car on the road.  I have no kids in car seats and some good music on the radio (no wiggles, thank you very much).  We have exactly two stoplights in the entire town, both of which were red when I rolled  through to make right hand turns.   Now, don't get me wrong....I slowed down and looked for oncoming cars and only one was coming, but they were still very far away.  I certainly didn't pose a danger to anyone (because that was seriously the only other car around).  The crummy part is that it was police car. He saw me blow off the first light and followed me to the second (which I also just slowed down and turned through).  Out come the lights and the sirens. He takes forever to get out of his car (doesn't he know I need to get back to my house???) and comes over, but not before searching the backseat for my non-existent open alcohol containers laying on my kids car seats. Oops, not only are there no bottles, but I don't have my drivers license (in my purse on the kitchen counter) or registration (lost it about a year ago).  He was very polite asked me some questions and returned to his cruiser for a very long time.  Came back with a written warning, so it could have been worse. My poor friend back at my house was working up to full on panic mode because I was like 15 minutes late and she figures I'm in a wreck somewhere.   Nope, just a typical mom with no kids in the car, listening to music, driving a little too fast on some empty roads.     urlLink    The evidence.&nbsp; urlLink

      I've been wanting to take the kids on a whale watch and yesterday seemed like the perfect day...Sunny, not too hot, kids weren't fighting.  So off we go.  It's over an hour boat ride to the whale feeding grounds. No biggie. Everyone is all excited.  Whales, whales, whales.  Then we get there, and we float and we float and we float.  Nothing.  Then we zoom off on a hot whale tip and nothing there either.  Wait...in all fairness we did see one Minke whale 1/2 mile away for approximately 1-2 seconds and later in the trip we (along with four other whale watches giving chase) saw another one about 1/4 mile away for 2-3 seconds.  I wish I was exaggerating.   My kids hooked up with another family and started playing hokey pokey and other kiddo games and soon enough we had a big group of kids playing simon says and the like. The kids had a great time anyway and what do they know that I'm out sixty bucks for this trip.    What really annoyed me was the fact that they didn't even offer a discount for another day or one free candy bar to every kid on board.  A little customer service goes a long way.  They were like "sorry, they're wild animals and that's how it goes". Good for them but for sixty three dollars next time we'll find some guaranteed fun.   urlLink    Sleeping Contest. One of the parents on the boat promised them a prize for whoever could pretend to sleep the longest on the way back to Plymouth.  Brilliant Parenting.  One mom came up to the top deck and asked if we were playing 'Jonestown'.  &nbsp; urlLink

      We couldn't have asked for a better weekend. Perfect weather, good food, great friends and family.  Went to a local beach on Friday with the kids. My son caught a huge crab and snail plus two of the hermit crabs we caught committed suicide rather than be put in the bucket we had (they crawled right out of their shells and fell back into the tide pool, 'goodbye cruel world') which we had never seen happen before.  My son loves that stuff.   Saturday we went to a marathon 12 hour cookout at my best friends house. She's got a pool and lives on a lake so it was back and forth from the beach to the pool. (Tough lives, eh?) and when it got dark we lit off fireworks and sparklers at the beach.    Sunday we lazied around in the morning and went to the inlaws for the afternoon. They've got a pool too and my sister in law did ALL of the cooking so what could be wrong with that?  Today it rained and the kids played and watched a movie and then we all went out and got Red Sox shirts!!  Reverse the curse baby!!   urlLink    Rainy Monday and Legos&nbsp; urlLink

      With the husband out of town we got up early this morning and hit two yard sales.&nbsp; I love poking through other peoples goods to see if I&nbsp;can find a treasure or two.&nbsp; I've&nbsp;found some really good things in the past, today it was just some Barbie clothes and a couple of Where's Waldo and Magic School Bus books.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; My husband is pretty much mortified that I would buy some one else's old stuff so I usually only go to two a year.&nbsp; But one of the ones that I do go to is really a lot of fun.&nbsp; It's an entire neighborhood, well, not the every house but about 75 -100 houses take part.&nbsp; I go with a friend of mine, from about 8 am - 12 noon.&nbsp; It's always the same weekend every year and this year we have a wedding to go to (husband is the best man) so I'm already in panic mode trying to schedule the time to go. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Wow, just read yesterday's post.  Think the kids (and husband for that matter) were getting to me?   Today was busier than usual.  Argued about the sitter's house this morning and like a light switch he went from screaming meanie to totally okay with going.  Who knows what goes on in those brains of theirs. To the sitter's, then to work, back to the sitter's, then home, immediately cooked dinner (of the gourmet grilled cheese variety) then I walked to soccer camp with my kids and Fred. Well, upon arrival my daughter starts crying, she's hungry, she's thirsty, she's bored.  Great.  So, back home we walk, get the drinks, some popcorn, and sweatshirts (why on earth is it so cold in July??), drop the dog off, grab some markers and paper and walk on back.   Then, when we get home (husband is out trying on tuxedos for his brother's wedding) I try to put them to bed. After 1/2 hour with the girlie she was wide awake (and now it's 9:15) so my son volunteers to try and I go upstairs to start working.  Just when I feel really fresh and awake (NOT!!). And I cannot put typing this meeting off for even one more night because I like to submit my work prior to the next meeting.  So I just finished working and my husband went to bed angry because I had to work and the computer bugs him and now I'm going to bed but first I have to finish this (blogging is a requirement for right now) and then let the dogs out, then cover up all of the furniture because the lovely big dog, Baxter, will sleep and shed all over it, then put a load of clothes in.    Sorry, just had to whine to anybody who'd care to read it. Am working tomorrow night, will return Wednesday....Till then...

      How do I know they're back? Well it couldn't be the attitude my son gave me when I tried to put sunblock on him before he went to a pool party.  Or the way my daughter cried when he wouldn't let her pet Freddy (because she saw him all weekend) or the way my husband got angry because I forgot to write the last check I wrote in the check register.  Well, they leave again Friday for another weekend....Adios boys!  Really, I'm glad they're home safe and sound but a few days without them suits me just fine too.  Plus my son threw a total fit when he found out that tomorrow was his day at the babysitter's house. It really is boring for him there but cripes, you'd think I was putting him in a playpen for 22 hours instead of his auntie's house for 4 1/2.  It's all babies (my daughter was the oldest one before he came for the summer)and not exciting at all but my son does not know the meaning of the words 'suck it up'. I mean, I only work one day out of the week and it's a half day at that.   Oooohhhh, my neighbors invited us over for a campfire and while I told them I have to work, my husband is loafing on the couch.  Hey bud, it's only summer for another month or so...get out there. I only included this last bit because the yummy campfire smell is being blown into my bedroom window from the fan and I love it. :)

That's the sound of my husbands truck stalling out and dying.&nbsp;   The garage calls us yesterday and for $1,000.00 the truck will be driveable again.&nbsp; The best part is that my husband could have fixed both my car and his truck but he just doesn't have the time to squeeze it in after work or wait for the weekend.&nbsp;  Oh well, can't win them all. Who really needs $1,000.00???&nbsp; Still going camping but not in a tent.&nbsp; We're taking the pop up to Cape Cod for a few days next week.&nbsp; Just me and the kids, my husband can't get out of work.&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a&nbsp;drive in movie theater a few miles away so we're going to see Shrek 2 one night & we'll bring our bikes so we can hit the Rail Trail.&nbsp; Other than that, no big plans.

Me, two kids and the tent.&nbsp; Yikes.&nbsp; I was going to head to the property in Maine with them but the husband is concerned for my safety.&nbsp; The nearest neighbor is about one mile away and sometimes we get visitors from down the road (guys on quads) and he doesn't entirely trust them.&nbsp; What's not to trust about toothless men on quads carrying guns?&nbsp; Just kidding.&nbsp; They have a few teeth.  &nbsp;  Actually, everyone who's visited us seems pretty nice (they usually bring their kids-not their guns-and some beers) but still, it is a long way from help and the cell phone isn't too reliable up there.

      Take the quiz:  urlLink Which&nbsp;Religion Best Suits You? &nbsp;  &nbsp;       Atheist   You are Godless! You could care less about religion. As far as you're concerned, if you can't see, touch and kick something, it's not real to you. You're day-to-day activities consist of eating, working, sleeping and the occasional Internet or coffee shop debate. Lastly, if anyone chooses to preach at you otherwise, you will either leave or debate them until they finally shut up.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Yikes.&nbsp; So the weather in hell forecast I just added to my blog can't be true can it?&nbsp; Ah, well I've gotten alot of grief for not introducing my kids to church.&nbsp; Totally not true.&nbsp; We've been to a Christmas Craft Fair at one and the holy man of Christmas himself was there.....It's Santa I speak of.&nbsp; Sorry to say my kids worship the bringer of presents.&nbsp; My son dressed as Santa for Halloween one year. Honestly, I just try to raise kind, polite and responsible&nbsp;children who can conduct themselves correctly in the world.&nbsp; Kids that I'm not embarrassed to say are mine when in public (That last one doesn't always work).  &nbsp;  Anyway, I've read the Left Behind books and they make it out like we've got plenty of warning if suddenly we need to switch to God's team.&nbsp; I'll probably wait until I see some of that stuff, disappearing people (most of my friends will still be around so I'll be in good company), the antichrist, etc. before I make any move.

      Well, we've returned. A day early. &nbsp;Damn the Weather Channel and their unreliable forecasts. They guessed at non-stop rain for Wednesday and Thursday and Surprise - wrong.&nbsp; We packed up and left yesterday&nbsp;and by the time I was done packing the entire camper up it had slowed to a light drizzle.&nbsp; Then it stopped.&nbsp;   The kids were&nbsp;kindy of &nbsp;whiney and greedy all weekend.&nbsp; My son informed me that he would stop complaining if I would just do whatever he asked.&nbsp; Pleasant boy. And my daughter is a champion instigator.&nbsp; We actually didn't have a bad time.&nbsp; We had campfires, went for a couple of bike rides on the bike trail that was attached to the  urlLink campground , went to the  urlLink Wellfleet Bay Wildlife&nbsp;Sanctuary  where a very aggressive member of the Audubon Society tried to muscle me into purchasing a membership.&nbsp; I cannont say enough good about the rest of the place.&nbsp; It was gorgeous. The&nbsp;trails were easy for the kids&nbsp;with little boardwalks sticking out into the&nbsp;coves for close up views.&nbsp;&nbsp; We saw tons of turtles, a red squirrel, frogs, fish, tons of birds and dragonflies, chipmunks and butterflies.&nbsp; Nothing really out of the ordinary for this area, but the setting was sublime.&nbsp;&nbsp;   We mini-golfed by ourselves&nbsp;at 9:30 in the morning at a place right off the bike trail.&nbsp; Turns out we beat the crowds.&nbsp; We drove by like 2 hours later and the place was jammed. Yay us!!&nbsp; Then the kids met some fellow campers and shot cap guns, played spy and painted rocks.&nbsp;  I got an awesome  urlLink campfire popcorn popper  for Christmas last year so I made a batch of popcorn then shipped them off to bed.&nbsp;   After the quick pack up we went to Provincetown for awhile and spent too much money on&nbsp;some&nbsp; urlLink necklaces , a&nbsp; urlLink dice game and a Thomas the Tank Engine card game  and we headed home.&nbsp;&nbsp; How does my son not notice all of the men couples and girl couples holding hands and stuff in this town??   And that was my camping trip.&nbsp; The End.&nbsp;

      Well, it's official....he's gone. After receiving such sound advice from his friend the chiropractor the roomate has patched things up with his mom and moved on outta here. My husband was pretty cool about the whole thing but he gave his true feelings away when we pulled in the driveway last night and he said "Please don't be here, Please don't be here".  My husband got rained out of work yesterday so we took a drive up to Kittery Maine to hit the  urlLink Kittery Trading Post . It's a fishing/camping/everything outdoors store. He wanted a new grill, I wanted a reflector oven for the campfire and my son wanted some fishing lures. So off we went. We spent too much money (a new jacket for my son and some books for us, a stuffed moose for my daughter - all necessities) but it's really a fun place to shop.  I hit the beach again with the kiddos the other day. My son got his first lesson in "don't let the ghetto kids play with your shovels". Not to be crude but when a brilliant remark like "I think I peaked out on my color, last few times I've been here I ain't seen no changes" comes out of the mom's mouth - steer clear. The kids that were with her and her friend took my kid's shovels, rakes and pails and one got stolen. Not at all a big deal, but c'mon when your 1 year old is toddling off down the beach (after he climbed over a big stone jetty) with someone else's things - try opening your eyes. I know, I know, your eyelids won't get no more color girlfriend, but sheesh- he's a  BABY !  I brought my Book Club book, My Sister's Keeper to the beach to read and thank god for the sunglasses. I was almost done with it and should have known better. After all it's a book about a 13 yr old girl who is trying to medically emancipate herself from her parents because they want her to donate a kidney (after a lifetime of other donations) to her 16 yr old sister who has leukemia and is in the final stages of renal failure. Sob, sob. It was really good. Sob, Sob. I had to put the book away and swim with the kids. It could've gotten ugly.

      Okay, I was rereading last night's post and thought - shut up already Jenny.  Or maybe not shut up but tone it down.  Is it really that bad, two days in our camper???  Probably not.   I was at WalMart scanning the high quality magazines for the one with the different cover story (wish you well Mary Kate but I read about you two weeks ago) and courtesy of US Magazine I saw that Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner may be an item.  Why, why do I care?  Don't know but I was strangely happy to see them together.  J Lo was a huge error in judgement (she's way too overrated), the Poker stuff, Ida know, maybe it's the Boston connection and  while Matt Damon's on a yacht in Italy while Ben's in a smoky casino playing cards for hours.  I just want to root for Ben.   Don't for get to vote in the  urlLink 2004 Gossipy Awards !

      My husband got some great aerial photos of his job site so I thought I'd throw some on my blog. They're building a new four lane road through a pond/cranberry bog area in these. He's also residing the house with the help of you know who. (And if you don't know who just see yesterday's post.)  Roommate Update: Quite obviously, having him help with the house was one of the biggest mistakes we've made in the recent past. He's back on the couch watching the Red Sox with the husband. He says that he was kicked out of his house...hhmmmm... his mommy called tonite and I answered the phone. She says "do you think he'll speak to me?" Hello....why is  she  groveling? Whatever the outcome of that conversation, he's still on the couch.  And another bit of great news....his parents were harping on him to get a job (which coincidentally will lead to money, a place to stay and all sorts of other great and wondrous things) well, his chiropractor says that a job for him right now would be counterproductive with all that he's going through. Hey there chiropractor, what's your address? Because I'll be sending him your way next. And naturally the guy ate that right up. Since when is a back cracking guy authorized to ruin my life? This joker has got to get a job and get the heck out of dodge.  The only part that sucks is the whole confrontation. I talk tough but really am a gigantic wimp. Fish and houseguests(camper guests) three day maximum right??? Please, send some encouragement and tough love talk my way..... it's cold stuck up in my room with the air conditioner, plus I want to watch a DVD.

      Hey, super, exactly what I didn't want.  My husband's newly seperated friend from high school with a host of issues has just taken up residence in my camper in the driveway.  He's now watching TV with my husband in the living room (hello, that's my seat on the couch buddy) and I'm hiding in my room watching the Amazing Race, blogging and basically freaking out.  His Story:  He starting dating this girl right out of High School (say 1986 or so).  They lived in their own little world and maintained their outside friendships. They both had family issues (hers a somewhat abusive dad, he a very hermit like father) and kind of dismissed their families altogether.  Well, ten (read 10!!) years ago he hurt his back at work (self employed carpenter) and he hasn't worked since.  Not at all. He started taking painkillers and smoking alot of dope.  She works as a dental hygenist and went to school for massage therapy, which she started doing too, in addition to teaching at the massage school (three jobs).  He became kind of reclusive, not keeping in touch with his family or friends.  All of his friends were kind of disgusted, lost all respect for him,  he goes dirt bike riding, doesn't do a thing in the house (no cooking,  some  cleaning) doesn't even try to find a job.  (Hint to friend: If you can dirt bike ride for a day or two you can certainly get some type of job)   A few years ago he quit the dope, doesn't drink and still doesn't work.  Then the wife bought them a house that needed to be completely redone.  Thinking he might be jolted into action and maybe work on his own home while she's working.  HAH! Wrong again.  She worked her three jobs and planed boards and framed walls while he watched.  Did I mention he's a perfectionist?  No?  Well he is and annoyingly so.   So the wife is getting a bit tired of this life, she's brought him to therapy (both back and head), chiropractors, doctors, holistic girls, whatever.  She bent over backward for years, waited on him, did whatever he wanted.  Now they've become isolated from both families and friends. He constantly puts their family members down and puts the wife down for wanting to mend fences.  The wife asks him to leave, he tries suicide.  Well, he only tried halfhartedly and mostly told his wife how terrible she was.  She calls the cops, gets a restraining order and boots him.  He moves in with the parents he can't stand.  Even better he makes no effort to get along with them.  Super.  And he's badmouthing the wife, telling my husband, he only wants her money, retirement, etc and he's going whole hog after it....  Hello Freak-She worked for that money!!  He's been helping my husband work on siding the house for the past two weekends and forward to tonite 8:00 p.m.  KNOCK KNOCK.

      Totally a normal day today.  I worked at the town hall for a few hours.  I got elected to bring up the boxes of old Conservation Commission stuff up to the attic. I made about 30 trips up and down a set of those pull down attic stairs in the stifiling heat. God knows I'll be happy never to see another storm water management plan for some stinking cul-de-sac in town.  It's very cheery up there - check out the picture.   But the treasure I found up there made it all worthwhile.  I had no clue where I should be putting these huge boxes so I was looking around and spotted an  old  Fisher Price garage and airport in just about perfect condition.  Now, I've got alot of the older Fisher Price little people stuff because my mom saved most of mine except I never did have that garage. But I've always wanted it and  bad .  So my mission tomorrow is to accost the town administrator to see how I can make that garage mine.   I bought a blow up boat for two this weekend and I took it out on the pond with my daughter after supper.  It was so beautiful out there and totally peaceful.  We live about 150 feet away from the shore and don't have a great view (my neighbor's house is in the way) but I wouldn't trade this spot for anything.  There aren't any gas motors allowed on the pond so its only paddleboats, canoes and rowboats.  In the winter we have big ice skating/hockey parties with the neighbors.   SNIFF......(pause here, I'm stopping to smell the roses).  Got an invitation to my brother-in-law's fiance's bridal shower for this weekend in New Hampshire.  Thanks for the 4 day notice. My husband is the best man in this shin-dig.  They've also planned a cookout locally for those of us that cannot make it to NH in a few weeks and we have plans that weekend too, and these are with my sister-in-law (sister of the groom to be).  Quite obviously, we aren't at all close to this brother-in-law, who will  be called BIL for short because he's really not worth typing all those letters for.  Anyway, this BIL of mine is a complete jerk.  Even my husband has had it up to his eyeballs with him and seriously considered refusing the best man duties.  We've met the prospective bride precisely one time for about 5-10 minutes.  This isn't a question of long distance, they live 30 minutes away.  I will tell this story another day, I'm just venting for now. The upcoming nuptuials are causing some stress in the family and it's rubbing off. But put it this way....after this BIL called to tell us he was getting married and would my husband be his best man, my husband gets off the phone and says "What the hell was that?? Three months ago I dropped him off at the train station with $7.00 and a tent and now he's engaged????".

       urlLink USATODAY.com - 90% of Afghans registered to vote   My husband's cousin called us from Germany last night. He's leaving very soon for Afghanistan to protect these newly registered voters. He is one of the nicest guys you could ever hope to meet and now he'll be in a desert far from home hoping to steer clear of sniper fire.  He was told by his commander that the local warlord types will wait for the first 10 or so voters to get off of the bus at the polls and shoot them dead to prevent the rest of the passengers from voting. His job is to prevent this from happening. My son thinks he is one of the coolest guys in the world. He is an only child and his mom's whole world. Please keep him in your thoughts.

      I can do whatever I want whenever I want.  And it ROCKS!!  It's 11:30 at night, Incubus is blaring from my computer and there's clean laundry all over my bed, begging to be folded.  I watched a movie while eating Chinese food on the couch! Usually a forbidden activity.  Not this weekend.  Rules?  Who needs 'em???   They've called a few times.  It rained and rained and rained on them.  My sister in law packed up and drove home.  My son begged to stay, so stay they did.    Did I mention that my husband is really in the top 25 of dads in the entire universe?  His husband ranking is still in question , but these daddy things he pulls, always get him a few notches higher.  Then his proverbial "So, what did  you  do this weekend?"  as he surveys the house with a disapproving eye will send him spiraling back downward.  This post is taking me forever to write (a bit o' Godsmack comin at ya loud and clear).   Turns out I am not a very successful addict.  Done with Webboggle.  Probably something to do with me not being a very successful player.  MMMMmmm - I just smelled my hands and they smell like bleach.  (proof I have been doing  something ).  I love the bleach/chlorine smell.  I also love the smell of a New England Boiled Dinner as prepared by my mother in law,  fresh cut wood, campfire smoke, and gasoline.  Who cares?  Maybe someone.  And if you're that someone...thanks!  The Pats won the first preseason game tonight.  I love that damn team.   Here are some pictures of my personal favorite:    Vs. Jacksonville     Tonight's Preseason Game  Well, I wasted alot of time fooling with those pictures, now it's late....g'nite.

       urlLink    Lunch!  urlLink     I can just hear my daughter hollering every time I look at this. Which is a good thing. I took this at Lion Country Safari this past March. My inlaws rented a house for a month this past winter/spring and we flew down for our first airplane ride vacation. We didn't hit any of the Disney/Sea World stuff and opted instead for the river boat 'alligator sightings' cruise and the beach and mini golf and that type of thing. At the airport all of the grammy and grampy types were asking the kids if they were going to see Minnie and Mickey. My son was like "Disney World is in Florida?!?!?!?" Oops, did I leave that out?  We tried the Kennedy Space Center. It bored us to tears. It was  hugely  expensive and so, so dull. The only way to even get close to where they launch the shuttle and all that is a 2 1/2 hour bus tour.  Huh ?? They want us to sit on a bus for 2 1/2 hours and get off once for a photo op and once at the gift shop?? Not this family. We opted for the space shuttle playground then took off to Cocoa Beach.  We loved stinkin' Lion Country. The kids were cuckoo on the Safari. It's one of those deals where you drive through this park and the animals roam freely (except the Lions, they have their own lion spot, because pretty much most everything else there was dinner) the Zebras and giraffes, elky things and Lions. They had such a blast it was impossible not to love the place. There's a zoo there too. A lot of lizards and birds, turtles and things. Did I say we had fun?  Well, they're all gone to Maine. I had to work tonight and they went without me! The house is quiet. Not the 'Phew, they're in bed quiet'. The 'The house is way too empty' quiet. The longest I've been totally without my kids before is 27 hours. My son's gone away with my husband and I've taken him away too, but no kids? After 27 hours I was pacing around, mindlessly cleaning the countertops and looking out the window waiting for them. Now I have three days if I want it. I could go up tomorrow night, but it's supposed to rain a lot in the next day or two and I'm not sure if I want to hang out inside the camper with the dogs and the kids. Plus my sister in law, her boyfriend and my nephew. But for now, I'm going to watch Dave Letterman in bed, wake up too late, eat cereal by myself and only make one bed. Did I say I was actually thinking about going to Maine???

      I just wanted to say thank you to  urlLink StrugglingAuthor  for giving me another reason to sit here instead of say,  doing laundry or dishes or something productive.  The reason is  urlLink this .  My name is Jenny and I'm an addict.  Of course, I kind of suck at the game, so this fascination won't last but another night or two at the most.  I swear three or four nights of this game and it's done.  I promise, by the end of the month I'll be ready to cut down to like every other hour and by like, Halloween I'll be almost ready to play only once a day.  I know, it'll be my New Year's Resolution.

      Last year my son wanted to join the Cub Scouts, big dreams of hiking, archery, outdoor adventures sucked him right in.  I was less than thrilled, they're pretty homophobic and then there's the duty to God thing.  But he was interested and if either one of those issues came up (which I really doubted) then I'd deal with it and chalk it up to a learning experience.  Well I attended the informational meeting for parents and because NONE of the other parents there were interested I volunteered to be the leader for the Tiger Cubs.  The parents come to all of the meetings at this age (and watch you while they drink they're Dunkin' Donuts coffee)  so that effectively doubled my group size to 26.  That's allota people.  It went pretty well, a few of the mom's thought they could do better (they never said so, I just got that vibe) - but since they never volunteered - oh well.  Let me first say that kids today will blow you away with their rudeness.  I heard that's dumb, this is boring, that's stupid from one, another one would make faces if you told him to stop talking during the closing or don't run and jump off the bleachers.  I will remind you at this point that the parents are also present at these meetings and do literally nothing but watch you discipline their children.  Some kids were just plain annoying but most of them were okay.  Now, the son wants to go to the next level and really wants me to be the leader.  I SO don't want to commit to this.  (The pack guy said one hour a week, LIAR!) I was told I could hand pick the kids in my group (which would have to be small because my house is teeny) so all of the jerky ones would fall in with some unsuspecting soul.  But the work load for this year in scouts (Wolf) pretty much doubles and I've picked up some more hours at work starting this fall.  And all of the parents expect me to come back and worst of all my son got his teacher assignment and 6 of the 13 boys from last year's den are in his class.  At least one of which was classified earlier as annoying.   How, out of seven second grade classes, did that happen?  I've started planning for the den meetings but then I got bummed out that these are every week and cripes that's alot.  Plus the relief I felt when it ended in April was still feeling pretty fresh.   I have no idea what to do.  Do it (and possibly resent it?)  or not do it (and possibly regret it)?  I really had some good ideas and really boy scouty things planned for this year but Ida know.  Done with the guilt, on to the leg warmers  Well, we're off to buy some jeans for my son, which he will only wear when he works with his dad, when he goes fishing or when he goes to Maine.  Never, ever to school.  The horror.  I bought him his first button down shirt to go with his first tie yesterday for the BIL wedding.  I cannot find a darn thing for the daughter, all denim jumpers and plaid for back to school.  GRRRR.  Just last month I was talking with a friend of mine and we were laughing at the clothes in the stores (ponchos, etc) how it was childhood revisited and I said the only thing missing is leg warmers.  Well they are missing no longer.  I saw them twice yesterday.  Can nothing stay dead?

      I am on the short track to hell. I found this over at  urlLink Dooce  and thought I can't be  all  bad. Turns out I was wrong.   urlLink The question you should be asking is 'Am I good  enough  to go to heaven?'

      Okay, so do Nakomis'!!     I've never watched BigBrother before this year, but I'm thinking she's on to something....giving Jase his key and picking Diane and Marvin.  Now they're all playing for the veto and Jase has no idea he's gonna get whacked.  At least he better, because then I've totally underestimated their stupidity.  It kills me that it's on three times a week.  I usually only catch one and a half of one.  Kind of a big TV commitment for me.

      Let's see....ummm.... Not a lot going on here.... More work on the house for the husband. Son is complaining that we haven't gone anywhere fun for three days and complaining about going to the sitter's house tomorrow. Daughter tried to learn to hula hoop.  She holds the hoop and shakes her bum around. Love her. (Love the son too especially with these earplugs I'm wearing) I cleaned the house, changed my daughter's bed two nights in  a row (love that overnite potty training), cooked dinner for company two nights in a row, babysat my mom's 14 yr old dog and rowed my dinghy over to the beach on the other side of the pond and layed in the sun for two hours with my next door neighbor.  Bliss.  Last night our good friends came by for dinner with their two kids and every time I think I'm am literally going to go crazy I should just stop for one minute and picture their lives.  They both work full time, they have a seven year old daughter and a five year old son that they just adopted through the Department of Social Services.  The daughter is having some real issues with her brother and now they are getting letters from the boy's dad saying that he wants his yearly visit and please keep in touch with me and wah, wah, wah.  She desperately wants to work part time and they just cannot afford it.  When she was pregnant with her daughter her mom told her that she'd babysit for her so that they could save all of that childcare money and put a small addition onto their small home.  Well, they did the addition and then had the baby and the mom changed her mind.  Nice, huh? I can't imagine coming home at 5:30 at night and only seeing my two terrors for 2 hours a day.    Then some more friends and our neighbors came by for some drinks and a fire 'round the chimenia.  I love summer.  My inlaws came over for dinner tonite and they played frisbee and hula hooped with my kids.  Again, I love summer.
