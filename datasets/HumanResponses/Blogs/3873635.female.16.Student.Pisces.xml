      I'm here at a baby shower and it has been 4.5 hours since I got here. (A little too long for my liking.) It was fun at 1st, but now it's boring. I wish I drove myself so I could go home now :( :(  Please don't do annonymous posts.

      I made Steffi watch the movie with me. I don't care what anyone says. Orlando Bloom is way, way, way hotter than Johnny Depp.   You best start believing in ghost stories Miss Turner. You're in one.

      Ok...showed up for debate club, NO ONE was there. I'm pretty sure I'm going to quit unless things change soon.  But while I was at the library, I checked out the trashiest romance novels I could find, so hopefully I'll have fun with that!

      I thought I would have fun doing this, but no. It's just making mre more bored. What do you do when your bored? I usually watch tv, but I spent 2 hours watching pure Jessica Simpson last night, and though at the time it was fun, I really regret it now. I just am not the type of person that deals with being bored easily. I guess I could do the SAT and ACT books my parents bought me... actually, no, I don't want to. I could also read, but that doesn't seem like doing anything to me! And I can't go to the pool becuase of this gay weather! >:(

      I haven't posted in awhile. I guess I just do it when I'm bored or angry. This is an angry moment. I suck at tennis. Today I played so bad :( I was playing really good the whole week until today. I don't wanna get demoted. So, I'm stressed about that. I need to go hit groundstrokes with someone.  Yesterday was a really good day though. I went to a fun party. I have to look at the good things in life.  I mean tennis was kind of fun today, because we had our annual Mother's Pizza thing. And Caitlin gave me a souviner (can't spell). That was cool.
