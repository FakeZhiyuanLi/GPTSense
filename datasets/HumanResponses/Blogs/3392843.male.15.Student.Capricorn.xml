       Well, today started off OK, I guess. Since my parents sold their restaraunt, they've been off for a bit, but my mom just started working part time at a green house about a minutes walk from my buddy's place. So I had to get up 6:30, which sucked. She dropped me off at school around 7:00. I was feeling OK, I got to the gym, one of the senior players was there. Talked to him for a minute or two, before I worked on some ball handling and shot around a bit.   I wasn't feeling it today, dunno what happened. Nothing seemed to be fallin'. Foul shot was off, the works. But you know, that happens sometimes. Some of the senior girls showed up, we shot around and talked for a bit. Nothing special. I finished off the morning with a game or twenty-one with this kid from my team named Chance. He's gotta be my favorite Rook' on the team. Seems a lot of the other ones are bitches. I was ice cold. I barely won the damn thing. I wasn't impressed at all.   Yeah, anyway, went to Math, got my test results back. 82%. Meh, I wasn't too excited, I wasn't disappointed, but I feel I could do better. Mark went up to 77%. I'm really underachieving this semester. Parents are riding me a bit. Then I went to English, lunch came, same old, same old. French, doing OK in that. Then I went to Socials, as usual Ms. Brown was a bitch.   Hopped on the bus, went home, wasn't feeling great. Came on the computer did some shit on here. Then I went and watched Sacramento play Minnesota. I was not impressed with that missed lay-up by C-Web. Cost 'em the mother fuckin' game. Garnett was nuts, as usual.   MVP style. MVP class. MVP ability.   He's a sick mother fucker I'll tell ya that much. After the game was done I watched the end of the Calgary, San Jose game. Man, everyone here in Van-City has jumped on the Calgary bandwagon and I'm pissed OFF. They're going to the Cup, everyone couldn't be happier, except me. Bastards.   Anyway, that's today for ya. Catch ya later.   -J
