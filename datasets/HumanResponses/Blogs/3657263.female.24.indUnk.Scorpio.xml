      it's the little things that get me. i burned my hand and you didn't care. i say something witty and you break it down. you say you'll do me a favor and then leave me hanging. hanging on your every word. why? why do i depend so much on you? why does my emotional health need your elusive approval? i didn't use to be like this. i was independent. and now i am slave to your love, against my will.   i wonder what it will take to get your attention? to make you care?

      borrowed from alanis morissette {so-called chaos}  Spineless    I won't see my dear friends as much male friends especially I'll no longer be in touch I'll change my hobbies to match yours   I'll stop reading my favorite books I won't spend all this selfish time alone I'll cater to you and hang on your every word  I'll be subservient and spineless I'll lick your boots as empty shell I'll be opinion-less and silent I'll be the prettiest appendage to ever lose herself  I'll redefine self-sacrifice live my life as apologetic compromise I know you'd leave if I rocked the boat  I'll be subservient and spineless I'll lick your boots as empty shell I'll be opinion-less and silent I'll be the prettiest appendage to ever lose herself  I feel this, truly proclaimed, will help the curbing of this tendency I know this sharing of shame will ensure that I won't forget myself so easily   I'll be low maintenance and agreeable  I will not talk about my dreams so much I'll listen to you for hours, won't need for anything  I'll be subservient and spineless I'll lick your boots as empty shell I'll be opinion-less and silent I'll be the prettiest appendage to ever lose herself"

       sometimes i can almost forget the bad dreams and pretend everything is ok. as long as i don't feel needy or clingy, i am all set.

       damn you for making me feel guilty about wanting to be with you! damn you for making me feel as if i don't understand what you are going through. you turn things around and all of a sudden i'm the bad guy.  apparently noticing my different hair color is asking too much of you. apparently telling me about your day drains you too much. apparently my fears and doubts hurt your feelings but your indifference does not hurt mine.  how can i get your attention?

      she lay awake at night after he'd gone asleep, wondering what she had done wrong. the man she loved lay next to her, on his side, snoring softly. the snores never bothered her. she actually kind of enjoyed it sometimes. he was fast asleep. he fell asleep quickly. after love, he was the typical male lover. turned around, fell asleep. or sometimes he would get up to watch tv. she was left to lie there in the empty bed, eyes wide open, craving a hug or a whisper.  the bed was empty even when he was in it. when she inched closer to him, he would move away, claiming she had cold feet.   "that's why i move closer to you," she said, laughing lightly. "to warm my feet!" but she felt no humor and her eyes moistened.  so she lay right on the edge of the bed, with barely enough space to feel comfortable or even enough blanket to cover herself.  he was not a bad person, really. but sometimes she did not feel loved at all. he did not touch her hair, except when he accidentally put his elbow on it and she cried out in pain and then he would move it away. she longed to feel his fingers run through her hair, which she strived to keep pretty and soft. he never sent her little notes or cards anymore, and did not remember to give her gifts. usually on her birthday he would just tell her to buy whatever she wanted. the present did not matter -- it was the  attention  that she craved.  she craved being near him without feeling afraid that he would grow sick of her presence. she craved being able to laugh loudly and carelessly without being told to shush down.   he said he was just busy and asked her to understand. of course she understood. but she needed him to understand, too. she wanted him. she craved him.  meanwhile, she lay on the cold mattress, and finally fell asleep.

      she found out. accidentally.  she found out about the letter. she entered the room and stood behind him and she spied the name on the letter in his hands.  that  name.  her  name. of the other girl.   she ignored the fact that things were not maybe going as well as they should be. she tried her best, really. she tried to be interesting. she tried to be romantic and warm and caring. she did care. she did.  but how could she compete? with memories. with invisible, unreachable, uneraseable memories.  she could not.  so she kept it inside and never told a soul. and it gave her nightmares.
