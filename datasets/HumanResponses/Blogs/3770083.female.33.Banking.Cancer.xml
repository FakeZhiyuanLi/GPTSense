       I am standing on the edge.  The edge of what I'm not quite sure yet, but I can feel the gaping maw of something waiting to swallow me whole. I feel it there, yet I just stand here on the edge, looking around, checking out the weather, looking at the trees. Basically trying to look everywhere but into the abyss.

       Standing on the edge of something much to deep...What is it in me that refuses to believe, it's easier than the real thing. Sara McLachlan said it best.   I can't sleep, and I'm exhausted.  I can't seem to get comfortable since I'm tired of laying on my back, and it pulls my staples to lay on my side.  It's making me crazy.  I think most of all I am mentally tired, worn out, numb. My food is gone, my comfort and my drug is gone and I don't know what to do without it.  I feel like a junky that's been thrown in rehab only I'm the only one here. I don't have the daily group therapy, no one encouraging me to "let it go" or "tell them how I really feel". I feel like I'm slowly unraveling while at the same time frantically trying to hold all the frayed ends together. On one hand I'm excited at the prospect of losing a significant amount of weight, but on the other hand I have this little stomach that needs to be fed all the time when I'm not hungry and this gas that won't quit.  I have the fear of not losing the weight, of being one of the few for whom it won't work as well as for others. I'm mostly afraid that the results won't be worth what I'm going through now.  Deep down I know that I did the right thing, and that it will change my life for the better, but I also feel that it's going to get ugly on the way there. I have been emotionally constipated for so long that I don't know if I can handle the flood of crap that is on it's way. Getting this surgery has popped the cork on my emotional bottle and It's been shook up good so stand back!    I have had other times in my life when I lost some weight and tried to change my eating habits, and in the process have begun to think that this is it! This is the time it will work!  Only after a couple of months I start to feel all the emotional blackness pushing to the surface and I get scared.  I get terrified.  I feel like if I let it go even a little that it will completely overwhelm me and I won't be able to control it. Kind of like the Hulk (only with a better script).  I know I need to go into counseling but that scares me too because I am afraid of what I will say.  I have things burried deep inside me that would turn my whole life and the lives of others upside down if I revealed and admitted them to myself. My doubts about my relationship with Doug, my relationship with God and my church, all of the things I've done since I moved here to Portland that would make my mom throw up if she knew.  It almost makes ME throw up thinking about them.   I suffer from depression but please GOD don't let me go back on anti depressants.  Not being able to have an orgasm was worse than being depressed. I need help and I need it fast.  I need spiritual help, professional help, personal help and a little divine intervention. Bottom line is I'm scared. I'm scared that loosing the weight and losing the food excuse will make me actually LIVE.  Damn, what a scary thought.  I have had the excuses for so much of my life I'm not sure how I will handle not having any.  Well, I'm falling asleep at the wheel here, so I guess that's a good sign that I've purged at least a little of my frustration here, at least enough that I can relax and go to sleep.
