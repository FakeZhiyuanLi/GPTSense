       Hey all, I'm here.....typin on my blog. Today, The first thing I did was eat breakfast.....lunch actually. I woke up at the crack of noon as usual. Then I went to my friends' house across the street to work on The SIx Cents. Ask me about it. We almost finished today. 2 People need to die and then we need to go to McDonalds to do the last scene. Also, me, my sis, and my Nazi Grandmother went to eat dinner at Jose's. A really good Mexican restaurant. But on the way out, some psyco mexican dude almost ran me over with his truck. Friggin moron...well, at least im still alive.

       aAnd Now, a quote from the great movie Monty Python and the Quest for the Holy Grail:      [trumpets] NARRATOR: The Tale of Sir Robin. So, each of the knights went their separate ways. Sir Robin rode north, through the dark forest of Ewing, accompanied by his favourite minstrels. MINSTREL: [singing] Bravely bold Sir Robin rode forth from Camelot. He was not afraid to die, O brave Sir Robin. He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways, Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin! He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp, Or to have his eyes gouged out and his elbows broken, To have his kneecaps split and his body burned away And his limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir Robin! His head smashed in and his heart cut out And his liver removed and his bowels unplugged And his nostrils raped and his bottom burned off And his...   SIR ROBIN: That's-- that's, uh-- that's enough music for now, lads. Heh. Looks like there's dirty work afoot.         I love this movie.....ah......
