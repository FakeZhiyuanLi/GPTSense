       So I'm sitting here, mocha in hand, wondering why I wrote that Pt.1 of 2 story in my previous entry. I started off just letting my mind work it's magic.. to see what I would come up with. I didn't even know what the story would be about, I just wanted to write. I think I'm pretty satisfied with how it turned out, yet I didn't mean it to be so long. And now I'll have to do a follow-up, which is fine because writing is something I love to do. So is that little mind flowing exercise. But I'm not sure when I'll follow it up.   I forgot how much I like Poe.

       Now, this has been itching at me. And it's my memory. Why were people staring at my mary-janes? This continually happened throughout that year of school, yet I never knew why. Too shiny? Too new? Too girly? Was I the only one wearing them or was I just following the trend? Or does this just prove that kids, of whatever age, have that evil side to them? Okay, that's a given. Hm.. I keep coming back to being the only one wearing them. Maybe that conclusion will quench my mind for now.  ***  The wind blew the tree branches against the window, bringing forth a strange scratching noise. One that Maggie could not stand, but thankfully she was about to have company and the approaching storm would not be a bother to her much longer.  She rose from her chair and padded over to the counter, where a bottle of wine and two glasses rested. Pushing her hair behind one ear, she removed the cork and held the stem of her glass as she poured. Once the liquid had settled, she brought the glass to her freshly glossed lips and took a tiny sip before a knock sounded at the door.  She set her glass down and made sure that her clothes were straightened and that her red hair was flyaway free. Satisfied, she sucked in a breath of fresh air and headed to the door.  Hand tight on the knob, she hesitated. This was something she'd been waiting for for a while. Yet she had her doubts. But this was not the time for them, so she forced all bad feelings out of her mind and softly smiled as she turned the knob and pulled the door open.  There he was, smiling back at her, with roses in his hand. His hair was spiked and his clothes were casual. His blue eyes shined bright as he stepped forward and wrapped his free arm around her waist, pulling her forward and into a hungry kiss.  Their mouths parted, still smiling. She stepped back into her apartment and away from the door. "Come in."  Wayne's eyes swept up and down her body before stepping inside and handing her the roses. She was wearing a blue and purple, form fitting sweater with dark blue jeans. They had decided not to wear anything special since they weren't going out. Yet there was something about the way she looked that night that made him think she had spent some extra time in front of the mirror.   Once the door was closed, Maggie walked back over to the counter and turned to him. "Wine?"  He nodded in response from the chair he'd seated himself in. Her apartment had a vintage look to it, one which he liked very much. It was a small apartment but one that she had fixed up to her liking, making it feel quite comfortable to all.  Before he knew it, she had seated herself in the chair across from him and handed him his glass which he promptly took a sip of. And now it was time to begin.

       So I'm on Ebay and I'm bidding for this item and I decide I'll just sniper* it. Good idea, right? So I go back an hour or so later, to just check in, and it's already gone up over 50 dollars!  I don't understand why people just sit there, constantly clicking the 'bid' button whenever they're outbid. Sure, it's an auction, and if you want the item you bid but if you keep bidding, you know someone else will and it'll just skyrocket and eventually you'll go over your maximum amount set. So why do it? Why don't people just sniper all the time? There could be like.. a mad rush to bid before it's over. And then the price won't be jacked up to where you can't pay and it's not worth it. Sure, the seller probably won't get as much if that's everyone's tactic, but it makes sense.   *sniper - For those who don't know, snipering on ebay is to bid during the last minute of an auction so you'll have a higher [almost 100%] chance of getting it that item.

       A little girl, about 6 years old, slides out of the car, lunch box in hand and backpack on her shoulders. She smiles at her mom before closing the door. One of her front teeth is missing but she’s beaming, ready to go to her first day of school.   She slams the car door shut and turns, facing the school. She’s wearing a white long sleeved shirt, with a red dress over it, and Mary Janes covering her tiny feet. Her blonde hair is curled all around, it’s ringlets galore.   She tightens her hold on her lunch box and marches confidently up towards the school, walking around many kids, much taller than her, some even shorter. She finally reaches the line outside her class, which she has been instructed to wait at until the bell rings and the teacher comes out to let them in.  As she takes a place in line, she smiles around at her fellow 1st graders. But they weren’t looking at her. Everyone’s attention was directed down at her shiny black shoes. The smile remained on her face, not understanding why everyone was staring at her shoes.   A few giggles erupt from the mainly lines outside the schools, all eyes on her shoes. The smile slips from her face, still not understanding.   The bell rang suddenly, and everyone’s attention snapped to the door, being opened by the teacher with curly red hair. A smile was plastered on her face as she ushered the kids inside. But the little girl did not go inside; she stood there, eyebrows furrowed, looking down at her shoes.  The teacher, Mrs. Rowley, walked up to her and gently took her hand in her’s. “Come on inside, Jessica,” she said with soft grace. “You don’t want to be late.”  Eyebrows still furrowed, tears threatening to spill down her cheeks, she let go of the teacher’s hand. “Hold on.” She bent down and set her lunchbox on the gravel beneath her. She then quickly removed each black shoe, leaving her small feet covered only in white tights.   She stood up and took the teacher’s hand once more, hiding her confusion and sadness by putting on a small closed smile. As the teacher led her inside, she kept wondering what had been the cause of the staring and laughter not 5 minutes before.   Though she could not figure it out, she went the entire day with her Mary Janes in her backpack and borrowed sandals on her feet and only replaced her own shoes with the sandals when it was time to go home.  ***  I was compelled to write this once it popped in my mind on the way home from a restaurant earlier. It's a good writing exercise, I would say.

       Our brains are so powerful. Though I suppose you all knew that.  "Out of Sight, Out of Mind" is a fun thing. I've seen it in action. When my dad had major back pains, so bad that he couldn't walk one day at home, he kept telling himself "out of sight, out of mind" and he was able to get up from the couch and walk all the way into his bedroom and lie down on his bed. Though it took him about 30 minutes and my mom to help him, he did it. He was pushing the pain from his mind, because the pain is really in your brain, not where you think it is.   I had an IV in my hand yesterday, and my hand itched, though common sense, people, you don't itch your hand when there's an IV in it. So my dad told me "out of sight, out of mind". That's usually how itches go away, too. Whenever I have an itch in my leg, or my arm, anywhere, you leave it alone and it'll go away. Because you ignore it and bam, gone. Usually, though, I'll itch said spot for like.. 10 minutes, because it's human nature, I suppose, and then I'll realize that itching it really won't help it. So I leave it alone, no matter how tempting it is to scratch, and the itch goes away. This really became a daily thing for me after I came home from Tampa last week. My feet had been attacked by misquitos over there, because I was always out at dusk, waiting by my friends while they had a smoke. And, I don't know, I was like, the person the misquitos would go to, sadly. And my feet were just eaten alive. Ew. So after realizing that itching them would only make it worse and probably leave scarrs, I just said "You know what? Screw it. No more itching." Lovely. Yeah, so out of sight, out of mind.  Pain is a thing I can deal with easily. I have a high tolerance for pain. The out of sight, out of mind thing really helps that, too.  I don't know why I'm making this entry, maybe it's because I'm just so out of it right now from the pain pill I just took [no, I don't have an addiction, blahdy da, I just had surgery yesterday], or maybe I have an actual reason. Oh well, who will know, I'm ending the entry now.

       The flames reflected off her smooth, honey-do skin, making a soft glow lighten up her body.  She was beautiful, lying there, not completely naked, but enough to be a masterpiece. Something to be cherished.  Her hair was swept up, almost playfully, in a small clip, keeping it from hanging over her beautiful hazel eyes. Locks of hair would slip away, though, and cast a light, beautiful shadow across her face.  Candlelight did that. Created the most beautiful shadows. It was all about the lighting, setting the mood was key. And lighting was a big part of that. Also light music in the background, playing faintly, as though it’s there, but not quite. It had to be comfortable. Calming.  The room was sensually dressed, silk sheets hung randomly across the chase lounge. Along with rose petals, a dark crimson, setting off a velvet look, making the few select petals lying across her body look right at home.   Her hand was placed under the side of her face, her head resting on her arm, which lie peacefully on a golden silk sheet. Her face was intimate, one eye at a sort of sexy glare, and her other one was half influenced. Her mouth rest in a sort of smile, which was barely visible to the untrained eye, but it was there and her pouty lips cast the tiniest shadow.   A golden sheet lay effortlessly over her body, as though it was just tossed on and never messed with. It exposed just enough of her breasts, to make it even more sensual, more nature. Her legs were exposed as well, along with her stomach, leaving the rest of the sheet to cover her even more intimate regions, slightly exposing the swell of her ass.  He sat there, across from her, watching her intently for a few minutes. Getting a feel of it all. And then he began to paint.

        Written on 6/25/04 at 3:52AM   " And it's ironic, too Cause what we tend to do Is act on what they say And then it is that way "  I'm sitting here, watching The Craft, listening to Jem, and writing this impromptu blog entry. Just a few minutes ago, I was also burning paper.. to watch the flames dance.  They do dance, you know. And just watching it is mesmorizing. It looks like a fun dance. It just, hops [that would probably actually go under 'jumping', though].  " And now you're satisfied A twinkle in your eye Go to sleep for ten "  I wish there could be a big building, rooms full of many different styles of burning fire, where you could just go to watch and lose yourself in the flames.  Of course, fire can be bad. And can bring forth scarring memories, ones which you may have tried so hard to repress, repress, repress.   " Child don't worry, it's okay The son is out for another day Today's the first day Of the rest of your life "  Why would somebody wants to repress something, though? No matter how traumatizing the experience, wouldn't just letting it go be  much  easier?  That way, you're at peace with it, having fun, and nothing can make it disturb you again. That would be an amazing way to live, wouldn't you say?  " Okay so here we go If it works, I'll let you know One, two, three, I say stop "  And if we could all live that way, wouldn't life be perfect and maybe even insecurity free? Besides those one-in-a-while traumatizing experiences, which we're end up letting go of, anyway.  That way, they wouldn't influence our decisions and there for our lives and futures. But then again, why would we  want  to live in a place called "Perfect"?  " I'm not messing, no I Need your blessing And your promise to live free Please do it for me "  Drama is boring, sure, but let's be honest, we need it to function. Do you know how unbelievably boring it would be to live  without  drama and just live out through a day-to-day basis, just doing the same thing, never getting your daily.. "balance" of drama?  Pretty damn boring.  And then it wouldn't really be boring, I suppose, because when you're bored, you resort to doing things, often times stupid things, like I do. And then the stupid things would create drama.. so you see, it's all a cycle.  " Please tell me that it's fiction Tell me it's just a lie Whatever you choose to tell me Please say he didn't die "  So even if you're one extremely strange person and want to live where everything's perfect.. you just can't. The cycle will repeat over and over and cause the unperfectness of life. Evening itself out.  And if you say you're life is perfect, you're flat out lying. Obviously. I mean, sure, you could be satisfied with your life, but it'll never be perfect.  " Or that city life is too frightening Won't you come home Please come home "  Oh, and by the way, I'm not watching I Know What You Did Last Summer.   All lyrics by Jem, song 1)They; 2)Come On Closer; 3)Finally Woken; 4)Save Me; 5)24; 6)Missing You; 7)Wish I. All lyrics were written down as the song played. There's no real.. cycle in that sense.

       Wouldn't you just love to be standing in line behind someone at a local grocery store who asks to have a bag of skittles put on layaway? Then, when the cashier insists that that person is playing a joke on them, the person makes a big scene of how she insists she wants the bag put on layaway? And that if he didn't do it, she'd go see the manager and complain? Wouldn't it just be easier and time saving if said cashier put the skittles on layaway for her?  People. They're funny.

       Travis was the perfect guy. The one for her. And she knew it. The day she'd met him was like a dream. You know.. the kind of things you only read about in books or see in movies -- or hear the 'friend of a friend' stories of.  His locker was next to her's. He had been there, pushing all his books in on the rustic top shelf. She walked up with her friend, James, to pull out some chem books when she saw most of his books come tumbling back out of the locker. Leaving him to look around, crimson cheeks, and bend over to gather his things.  She felt bad for him, and was surprised. He didn't look like a clutz to her. So she bent down and helped, glancing quickly at him, but catching his eye, locking the gaze. Slowly they rose from their previous position, books in hand.   Handing his thing back to him, she looked down, suddenly aware of her bright "Toilet Love" t-shirt. Embarrassed, she quickly crossed her arms over her chest and smiled. "Hi."  "Hey.. thanks for the help. I'm Travis." He put his hand out, to shake her own, which surprised her even more. It wasn't a common thing done among her age group.  This would also mean leaving part of her shirt uncovered. She slowly took his hand in her's and gave it a firm shake, then quickly tucking her arm back under the other one. "I'm Diane. So how is it I've never seen you around here before?"  "I'm new. As in I  just  got here, new," his nose crinkled at his words. Getting the extreme ridiculousness of them.  "Aaah... opposed to the.. got here 20 minutes ago, new." Diane laughed, hoping he'd join her so she wouldn't look like a complete idiot laughing at her own joke. Reluctantly, he laughed, too.  And that's how Diane met the future love of her life. They would go out many times and pass notes in class everyday. But nothing would happen. They would share their first kiss on Halloween, but decide it would be easier to not act on their want, their need. Their quiet passion for each other. But they would remain friends for years and years to come, and one day become secret lovers.   That was her storybook life.  /END

       It's crazy how at one minute, you're so excited, you can't wait for something. And the next your angry, shaking, and crying. Or the other way around. It's crazy how our emotions can change so fast, weither you want them to or not. Weither it's over.. shoes or memories or a silly number. Trivial, not so trivial. Doesn't matter. It sucks, and then it doesn't suck so much. Life, my friends.  I may be going to LA a little earlier than I thought, this summer. Because of moving and such. Which would be great but then I'd still have that dreaded Atlanta layover. Though if I went on the day I planned, my layover would be in Cincinatti. It's basically up to me. Oi.

       Why do people ask such stupid questions?  An example would be to say you're standing at the counter, with a toaster, which you're about ready to buy. And the person comes up to you and asks "Can I help you?". What does he think he can do? I mean, you're standing there, right? You have a toaster on the counter, right? Still he asks "Can I help you?". No, no you don't need help! You just came in to brown up some rye bread. Then he asks "Can I show you something in the toaster?". And you'd like to say, "Yes, your head," but you don't because you're trying to be civil, which isn't easy considering you're talking to a stupid person. Then, when you hand him your credit card and he asks, "Will that be cash or charge?" you say "Charge," because at this point, you're just as stupid as he is.  Makes you wonder if these people used to ride the short bus to school.

       Psychology is fun. Just makes me really look forward to it in high school and college. At least one thing to make me look forward to high school, yeah? That and drama. I think my whole perspective on high school is changing, as I get closer to it. I think I'm mostly looking forward to being social again and having more than one extra curricular activity. Although, kids are really, really cruel in this day and age. Aren't they? What's made them so evil? Where they this manipulating 3 years ago? 4? 5? 6? Okay, yes, so I'm a teen. But I don't think I'm cruel.  Isn't the 21st Century grand?  Oh, and I've also become more and more aware that in FL, you almost always have to look at the ground in front of you when you're walking outside at night.. because of the freaking huge bugs. I became pretty damn aware of this when my brother stepped on a potato bug the other day. Ew.

       As a Taurus, I'm prone to extreme jealousy. And extreme anger. And it's true, too. I have some severe jealousy issues, and possibly some anger ones.   See, my friend told me she had a kick ass time somewhere. I'm not going to go into any details, but instead of being happy for said friend, I became immensely jealous and got really upset, to the point of crying about it. Lately, I've been doing the crying thing a lot, my emotions just seem to be running high. But I hate crying, because then I feel sorry for myself and then I feel angry that I'm feeling sorry for myself. I'm good at being overdramatic, I think. I'm also good at feeling the wrong emotions at times.   While thinking about the fact that I get overwhelmingly jealous and angry, I began to think of how my friends forgive me so many times and still manage to love me. Makes me wonder how wives, who get abused by their husbands with anger and jealousy problems, continue to forgive their husband over and over and love them nonetheless.   I struggle to understand myself more and more, yet I keep leading myself into these 'going nowhere' corners of desperation. Desperate to understand life, to understand why people do the things they do, why I do the things I do. Why I'm driven to just be inappropriately jealous. And that's the real issue here, in this entry. Is why I become jealous and hurt when I should be happy and caring. I'm naive.  Back in December, I was desperate to find my purpose. Honestly, I can't remember what made me want to do that. Do I have a purpose yet? At my age, who knows? Just got to wait and see.. that's one of the things I really suck at, too. Waiting.    ETA : Okay, I feel better about it all now.

       Okay.. so I'm indulging in the act of doing stupid things lately. Not on purpose, of course. But sometimes it's just those things that everyone does now and then.. and then sometimes.. it's not. There's the little things like.. when my contacts aren't in, I'm going around looking for my glasses, when they're on my head [where I put them when I'm taking my contacts out]. And there's the looking under the desk for my shoes and having like.. a blind spot where they're under there but I can't see them, so I walk around the entire house before I decide I'll check under the desk one more time and they'll be there, waiting. And just this morning, I was looking around for an article of clothing which I needed because the packers were about to come in and estimate how much packing they'd have to do in my room, and I was literally looking for about 5 minutes until I realized I was already wearing it. And by that time, I was uber frustrated.   And though I've mentioned it, I'll do it again. I always have a problem finding my shoes. I just have some sort of blind spot for them or something. They'll either be by the couch or under the desk or by my bed or by the counter, whatever, and it'll always take me a second or third time looking there before I actually find them. Everyone does it, I know, so hopefully I'm not the only one who does it about a million times a day.  Okay, and is it weird that I'm singing along to Abra Cadabra and liking it?  Make me laugh, make me cry ...   On a side note.. did you know that you have to sign up [and possibly pay] for dictionary.com so you can get a 'premium' account. What's a premium account on  dictionary .com? A place for people without dictionaries to go and check out the kick ass things you can do with regular dictionaries? Oh, fun! Let's go sign up!.. in the way that, no, no it's kind of aud..

       Have you heard the 'such is life' saying? What does that really mean, anyway? Though I don't understand, it annoys me nonetheless. Because it's always said about the bad.. just like 'everything happens for a reason'. Sure. I believe that. But ever notice that whenever someone says it, it's always about something shitty? It's strange.   Onto another topic I was thinking about earlier, on the way home from the airport. Ever just stop to think about the life of a greyhound? Here's a greyhounds average life cycle: You're born, you're trained for about a year and a half, you begin racing, getting whipped, kept in small cramped spaces, you run until you literally can't run anymore, you retire around 3 years old, and then you die with scars all over your body from a life with nothing but work. "Such is life" John, a friend of mine, says. But shouldn't it be different? Shouldn't it be different at some point? My dad says you shouldn't get a puppy greyhound because if you get a puppy, an adult will die. You see, if nobody rescues [houses] the greyhounds once they retire, they kill them.   I had a greyhound when I lived in Las Vegas. Her name was Fay and she wasn't quite three yet, but she wasn't fast enough to race. So if nobody adopted her, they would have killed her. Once we got her, her body was covered in many, many cuts and scars and she was extremely timid around humans. We had two little mini-chihuahuas at the time, too. But I loved Fay and I wanted her to be happy and free around me, not timid and scared. So everyday when I'd come home from school, I'd go and I'd hang out with her, just because. I'd pet her until she would fall asleep or I would pet her while laying down next to her and napping with her. She warmed up to me instantly, and to my dad, who loved her just as much as I did. But she was still quite timid around my brother and mom. It even got to the point where, when I would come home from school or I had free time, I would go down in the big front room of our house and get on all fours and bark at her and run around playing with her. I would get a bowl and fill it with water and whenever she would go get a drink and rest, I would go and get a drink from my little bowl and drink out of it like she did, and lay down beside her to rest. She was basically my dog. And she was soo sweet. My little chihuahua dog, Sampson, was like her little puppy, too. He was the same color, just so much smaller, and he looked a lot like her. He would hang out with her in her big huge cage [she didn't have to sleep in it, of course, she had the freedom to do as she pleased around the house, but she liked it in there] and act like her little pup.   Until the day my mom decides Fay was too big for our house so we had to give her away. I was completely devistated. I was out on a bike ride with a friend and when I came back to the house, Fay was being put into someone's car. It felt like something was being ripped out of me and chopped into little pieces. My mom promised me we could go see her but we never did. Even when I wanted to, I would remind them 'Mom, you promised! Can we go visit now?' and it was always 'maybe another day, honey'. I miss her even to this day. I still love her, and wish she were here. Wish I had more than a few minutes notice before she was taken away, wish that her entire life had been different. That she didn't have to endure the years of pain and not being loved until she got to our house. I'm just glad she was among the many greyhounds they kill when they don't have a home to go to once they retire. I wish greyhounds didn't have such cruel lives, that no animal did. "Such is life"? No, life should be different.

       Now, since I'm boycotting all personal entries in LiveJournal, looks like here will have to do for a semi-personal-type entry. Okay? Okay. :)  Today I had the unpleasant experience of getting hit in the face. By who? My mom. Not a punch, at all, but actually more of a slap. We were in the movie theatre [about to see The Day After Tomorrow] and as the slides were rolling, the slap happened so I shot onto my feet and stormed out of the theatre to the girls restroom, where I just waited for about 10 minutes. Waiting for nothing really inperticular. Then I went out and sat on the bench by the concession stands [what a nice theatre, by the way] until my dad came out of the theatre and began to lecture me. Hmm...  I must figure out a way to buy a romance novel where my mom won't question the contents.. because I'm craving one and I want one by a published author.. my friend raves about the ones she owns and then another friend highly recommends them, too, so I must oblige and get one!  ---  "My name is Diane. I fell in love at the fragile young age of 17 but sadly, nothing ever happened with him, though I wish it had. Since I met him, my expectations of men have been high, yet I've never met one even remotely as perfect as him.. so there became a void. Some people use support groups, friends, school, and other stuff to fill their voids.. I use men."  /to be continued.

       Ever been just so fucking damn frustrated that you feel as though you could punch a hole in the wall? I'm sure we've all felt it. So many times throughout today, I have felt that. One of those times was caused my LiveJournal. How, you ask? To put it simply, it's a bitch. So I'm boycotting it for a few.   I wish I wasn't such an ass all the time. And I'm aware that I am. Which makes other people irritable around me. Why would I be an ass if it made people moody, themselves? I don't know. I guess that's what makes me an ass.  Oh, and I must comment on the latest dumbass show.. WB's 'Superstar'? What a terrible show. You're boosting people's self-esteem and making them feel great just so you can take it away in the end, when you tell them that, basically, they suck and that you were toying with their emotions for public amusement. It's almost as terrible as The Swan was. I swear, these people run out of ideas so they just randomly think of the worst thing and make it into a series and humiliate those involved. I'm so sick of these stupid reality shows.. the games shows, the hoaxes, the publicity stunts. Can we have some actually worth watching television programs, please? All reality TV shows should go to hell.  /rant ended  So.. bring on the summer. :)

       How come the world 'trippy' isn't around anymore? I've taken to saying it more and more because it's just one of those fun words to say! Like.. 'hugemongous' or-or 'qoinkidink' or 'fucky'! And this is my inner child poking her head out.. or is it my all-the-time child? Hm. Back on the topic, don't you remember when 'trippy' was around all the time? I really don't, actually. But it should come back.   A memory came flying back to me the other day.. when I was a little girl, my mom had my brother and I going to church every sunday and had us also attend primary school once the sacrament was over. We were Mormons [I don't belong to any one religion as of late]. And there was this TV show on PBS which was affiliated with our [and others] that chose different primary classes from different schools to come and participate in the show. It was some childrens morning game/talk-type show. So once our clas was chosen, I was ecstatic.. I was around 5 maybe?  So we went to the studio and my dad waited in the lobby while my brother and I went into the filming room with the other kids and the first thing which was filmed [it was live, btw] was which one of us could say 'insert tv show's name' the loudest. Of course I raised my hand to participate in that and once he got to me, I went to scream it in the microphone but no sound came out. I had lost my voice. On live TV. At the age of 5.   ETA : I absolutely must add this.  urlLink George the Monkey

       Here's my question for today: How are some people not comfortable with their sexuality? I mean, those who know me know that I'm extremely comfortable with mine. So you can see why it's hard for me to comprehend why some people aren't comfortable with theirs.  My newest obsessions are mochas and astrology. There's some random facts that you can stick in your pipe and smoke.  *** "So how've you been, Maggie?" Wayne would start off the conversation. It took all he had in him not to get up and just carry her to the bed in the next room. It'd been a while, but he still loved her. He wondered if she knew that.  "I've been okay.. I mean, not as okay as I was when we-- I mean, when  I  was living back in New York." She paused, thinking carefully. "Well, my sister is coming to visit me next week so that'll be fun." She sighed, and set down her glass on the table. "I miss New York though. I don't know why I moved all the way out here."  "To get away from me," he flattly sad. Though he hoped it wasn't true. They'd had a bad break up and she moved half way across the country. This was the first time he'd seen her since then.  "Don't say that because you know it's not true. Shit, I even made plans to move out here  with  you." Her hazel eyes moved to lock with his. "But life stuff got on the way."  His eyes scanned her body, again. She looked so gorgeous and she was wearing a sweater that had been a gift from him. Again, he had the urge to just bend her over the arm of her chair but, though she was great in bed, catching up was something that must be done first.   While looking at her engagement finger and seeing the ring he'd proposed with gone, he whispered, "I still love you, you know."   He then looked up at her and saw her eyes gleaming with love and seduction. She smiled. "I know. I love you, too."   That's it , he thought. He rose from his chair and went to her's, pulling her up to him by her waist and kissing her long and hard, making up for all the lost time.  Her body seemed to go lip in his arms, but her mouth was still entertwined and at work with his. They collapsed together in her chair and their hands went while, reaching out to feel what was once felt.  As Wayne's hand headed to unclasp her bra, the phone shrieked. Their mouths parted, leaving them short of breath.   Maggie looked apologetically at him before reaching for the phone, one leg still over his leg, keeping his body close to her's.   "Hello?" She paused before slumping her shoulders and silently sighing. "Hey mom."  Wayne rolled his eyes and sighed with her before heaving himself away from her body and off the chair. He walked back to his own chair and picked up his jacket from the back of it. He then took his glass from the coffee table and quickly gulped the contents down before sliding on his jacket.  By this time, Maggie was carrying on a conversation with her mother, seemingly becoming annoyed. She looked up at Wayne, who's hand was on the doorknob, yet he was turned, facing her, waiting to get a word in.  Her mom was going on about her poolboy, who was apparently Mexican and kept eyeing her, which made her uncomfortable. Typical of her rich mother who had married for money and afterwards fell in love. "Mom... mom! Hold on a second."  She pressed the 'hold' button on the phone's base and set it down before rising from her chair and walking to him. "I'm so sorry. You don't have to go.. I mean, you can stay if you're not too freaked.."  He betrayed his heart and shook his head. "No, I better go, work in the morning and it's getting kind of late."  He brought his hand up and tucked a tendril of her hair behind her ear before kissing her forehead. "It was great seeing you again, Maggie. Really."  And that was it. He smiled before turning and pulling open the door, walking out, and shutting it behind him, leaving her alone once again in her apartment. She turned, dejectedly, and walked back over to the phone, pressing the 'hold' button and lifting the phone to her ear. "Yeah.. I'm here."  /end

       Not until now have I noticed how similar little girls are. They each go through the same phase, which is funny.   There's the "Everything Pink, Blue, or Purple" phase, where all they want is pink, blue, or purple things. Barbies, beddings, clothes, walls, ect. In this phase, which also lasts another phase or two, is the barbie or paper doll phase. Now, I remember when I was really little and would save up all my money to get a book of paper dolls. Weither it was Cinderella, Snow White, Beauty and the Beast, or Anastatia [which I personally loved the best], I loved paper dolls and bought them all. Just to put the paper clothes on the paper dolls, and make them walk and talk. I also, of course, had barbie dolls, though I was much more fascinated with the paper dolls. So there's that phase.  Then there's the "Fake Make-Up, Princess Shoes" phase, where you get very into the plastic princess shoes and those little girl make-up kits with the dark purple, blue, red eyeshadow, and bright pink, purple, blue, white, red lipstick, and you just  can't  forget the blush! Assortments of INSANE colors to dress your face up with.. or your hands.. or the walls, it was just fun to play with.   Then there's the phase where they because the stereotyped 'sporty', 'tomboy', or 'girly'. Sporty is, of course, where sports are your main priority and something you'll love throughout your life. Tomboy is just.. being very hands on. Going outside all the time, playing, getting dirty, not wanting anything to do with pink or girly things.  And then there's Girly. Where nice girly colors are your favorite, and you like fashion with the dresses and the skirts and the extras. Not wanting to get dirty and just wanted to be very careful and lady-like.   There are phases in between, obviously, but these are the main three, I think.  My phases were [in order] Paper dolls, Barbies, Doll Houses, Princess Shoes, Fake Make-up, Britney Spears, Sporty, Rock, Dark Colors... you get the picture. Very different.   And then, once you're in your "double digits", the adults that knew you as a child, be it somebody related or friends of the family, love to bring up the silly things you did and if it's completely different than your personality, you crinkle your face and make 'ich' sounds, while secretly becoming nestolgic and wondering what other things you did as a little kid.  Of course, these are only the female phases.

       For the past two weeks I've had so much to do, all day and everyday. It was so awesome. There was a day of rest in there, as well, but I was so occupied, it was wonderful. And now, I can't, for the life of me, just sit around and do nothing all day, after I've done so much for the past two weeks.     I've just moved to a new state, so I figure, hey, I'll be able to do many things, i.e. unpack, clean up, do something. Yet, it's always "No, those are going to be unpacked later," or "No, we're not picking those out until your room is painted NEXT WEEK". I can't even fit into my room, man. The living room is practically my room. Privacy, much? I can't stand having nothing to do all day. Seriously.    What a wonderful point in my life, I've reached.     /sarcasm

       Today I confirmed one of my long time suspisions. I'm afraid of time. Or.. I just hate it. Though, it's crazy, time is passing right now, but I hate time. I either want it to pass or just go so slowly so I can savor the moments.  Earlier today, I met somebody who made me realize this. His name is Kelly. After meeting him, we were walking down the street, passed the Los Altos Apt/Hotel building, and I got shaky in the knees and had to sit on the sidewalk for a second, replaying it all. I suddenly went into this total asshole person, angry that the time was over, the time of talking, the time of meeting, and visiting with this person. Someone who, I never had a clue that I'd meet. I never expected to. Maybe his brother but not him. You know how that is?  So.. maybe I'm afraid of time or of memory, or I just hate them both. Some people get extreme merriment or pleasure out of memories and are fine with the passing time, but I'm not. Sometimes I'll look back on memories and giggle, going "oh that was fun, that was quite awesome!" but mostly it'll be "why didn't I do that? what the hell was wrong with me? why did it have to be over so soon?". I guess it's just the kind of person I am.  I can't stand it, either. I hate being an asshole when it comes around.

        Abby's Tradition   Excitement filled Abby's eyes as she watched the fireworks shoot into the air and explode, eliciting sparks and a loud POP! sound. Each time, her eyes would follow the accending ball of light into the air, as a cat would to a string being dangled in front of his eyes.  Her eyes would go wide everytime a firework would expand and fall away to the ground, fading as it fell.   Each year, though, her mother could never afford fireworks, so Abby was forced to watch the festivities without participating. But that was just fine to her, because she had nothing else to compare it with.  She loved the colors, the shapes, everything about the bursting fireworks. Anticipating what it would do once it showed it's true personality was something she loved to do.  She went into a child-like state on the 4th of July. Every time. Which was expected when she was an actual child. But this 4th of July, she was 15, and it still amazed and excited her.  And this year.. she bought her own fireworks.  ---  It's funny how.. as we get older, we begin to mold our memories so they're whole.   When I was much, much younger and still watched Barney, I had an accident while my mom was in the shower. I wanted to hug Barney so I went up to the TV and hugged it, only to have it fall over on me, splitting my lip open. This is how it happened, or so I'm told. I don't remember it at all.. and the only thing I do remember of any of that experience was at the hospital when I was getting stiches. But that strange thing is.. I don't remember  being  in the room. It was like an out of body experience, or so I remember it. I just remember being in the waiting outside the room, hearing myself scream inside.   I'm told that my dad had to hold me down, as well as the doctors, and I was also tied down to something, while they put the stitches in.   Maybe I just dreamed this or thought it up.. molded a memory so I'd be able to say that I do remember part of it.. who knows? Maybe it really happened and I did have an out of body experience.  I've also molded a memory as to how the falling went. This one I've actually put together, just so I can put some sort of image to what I've been told.   It's strange.. funny, even. How every person will mold or dream a memory. It's also intruiging. Hmm.. have you ever done it?

       Be prepared for musical ranting... meaning I'm going to be going on and on about music. :)  I love music. It's a big part of my life because it helps shapes my moods and see the other sides of things. But it has to be some kind of music that tells a story or opens up your mind a little bit.  Lately, I've been an eensy bit obsessed with the band Kane. I've been listening to it vicariously, pretty much non-stop. Weird thing? It's country. Now, I'm not usually a country fan. I mean, sure, it's okay music, but I'm more of a.. everything else girl. Besides hip hop and rap. Eugh. So it was strange, I had never heard of Kane before two weeks ago, at a convention. I even bought their CD before I ever listened. But the first time I did listen was at a concert, and it was amazing. They have such stage presence, man. Anywho, I'm not one to really listen to country! But Kane is country. It's.. country/rock. And it does just that.. rock. Their music tells all sorts of different stories.  Jem is also an artist high up on my list. And I sincerely enjoy her music because it helps you. It makes you feel good, gives you a bit of perspective.   For me to like music, it has to be 1)original; 2)interesting; 3)enjoyable [*coughobviouslycough*]; and 4)something to make the mind expand.  Hmmm.. is that too much?

       I'm drowning in my life right now.. and I try to focus on the good things.. but it doesn't help. Getting through the day is just so hard.. even when I have something to do. And the one thing I was looking forward to in NC has now been taken away... and it's too much for me to handle.. I'm trying to handle it but I can't. When did I become so fragile? When did I become so negative? I've just been so negative for so long that it's hard being positive for myself and not just for others.. not even an entire year ago, I was positive and helpful.. now I'm just pessimistic and weak. I'm being run down but pessimism.  The thing I'm having the WORST time with is talking to my best friend. I need somebody to talk to in a huge way.. to help me get through the hard parts.. but whenever I talk to her, it feels like it's going in one ear and out the other.. and I'm just as alone as ever.  I just need somebody to talk to.. just somebody to listen.. and to tell me the truth, instead of the "it'll get better" bullshit. Because I know that it may.. slightly.. but it's not going to get better until I'm happy.. and I'm having such a hard time being happy here. I really am. I can't stand my life right now.  ...I want an acting job.. and my mom doesn't even support my ambitions! I'll be happy.. when I'm acting.. and maybe my fears will be quelled once I'm actually ENROLLED in school.. but I'm not yet. And it starts on the 16th.. I don't know what I'm going to do.. I just feel like screaming and I know I can't. Maybe I'm being overdramatic and maybe I can feel it, I know it... and maybe I've sung this tune before, many times.. but I just feel this way every day and I can't go without getting it out. I just can't.  I can't get this out on LJ so I'm doing it here. Deal.
