      I had a lovely day yesterday. I went out with someone (His name is hidden in my blog) and I was so comfortable with him around. We had dinner together, still can remember his funny facial expressions when he ate the cheese nuggets. The advise he give me after dinner was " Dun ever offer things to pple if u had not tasted it urself" hehe.... So cute of him. After that, we did some window shopping and I got him some chocolate biscuits cos I know he got a sweet tooth but then I shd have ask if he's ok with the biscuits. Silly me.  After that, we went to play arcade. He was into shooting games, but he dun mind watching me play Guilty Gear. Not very gd at it but still not bad lah. haha...... Anyway, the graphics were gd and I got him to try out the game as well. Can u believe it? He actually complete the game when it's his first try. Really make me look damn lousy.   After the game, we took mrt and I saw him off at Boon Lay before I took mrt back to Hougang. During the journey, he called me up to tell me abt the blackout. So sweet of him, rite? hehe...... But then it was real horror when I reach home. The street lights are down, traffic lights are down and I got to use my hp light to find my way around. Damn tiring.   That's all for yesterday.  Told K abt my feeling for the guy I went out with yesterday and I thought that he would be happy for me. In the end, K called up the guy and start wishing him and me to be happy together. That's it. The guy thought that I am rushing into things and I am so confused now. Dun dare to think of the future. Dun even know what would happen to both of us now. Sigh........  Really hope that I can get to know him better with more time and maybe see if we are suitable for each other. Now that this happens, I also dun know what I shd do now. I am always at a loss when I am sad. Life sucks BIG TIME..............

      Sigh......... I send GB a personal sms&nbsp;before noon&nbsp;and he had yet to reply back to me. Wondering what's wrong? Too scared to send another sms to him cos he might be busy and I really dun want to disturb him but the waiting is killing me liao. Guess I give him some time till tonite loh. Planning to meet him up soon again cos I had a surprise for him. hehe.....   Quote :&nbsp;You know that you are in love when you keep talking abt him and not urself. You keep talking abt him cos he's always on ur mind and you want to know more abt him.

      Wow, I had not been posting anything for 2 days liao. Well, I was on MC on Wednesday in order to avoid a damn annoying bitch. She's such a horrible bitch at work loh. She send me 16 sms in a row on Tuesday evening to make sure that I would talk to her on Wednesday. She keep saying that she wants to show me a different point of view. I was like " WTF", I bet you only want to show me YOUR point of view and make it accept it, so that I can lessen your workload and do ur bidding. Well, fat hope loh cos I dun want to talk to you at all and I mean it. How dare that fucking bitch even try to threaten me over the sms, to make me do her bidding and get our boss to approve both of us to have this informal talk. Fuck her lah.   Wednesday   I was on MC, so I just basically stay at home and rot the whole day. Not much happening cos I am really not feeling well. Didn't even really chat with anyone on the phone and it was a nice feeling I guess, to stay in my room and have the whole house to myself. Such peace. All I lack now is someone to hug and listen to some music. Sigh...... When can I find the rite one for my life? I just realised that cos someone feedback to me that quite a few pple from the forum is reading on my blog. OMG!!! What are they trying to do? If they are reading cos they are curious and concerned, it's fine with me loh, but if they want to make me the topic of the next outing, then pls leave loh. I am not going to be the gossip of anyone loh. Since some could be still reading my blog, I got special nicks for those that mean a lot to me liao. hehe.........   Thursday   I came back to work but that bloody bitch is still trying to get me to talk to her. Fucking Hell !!! I put on an act and claimed that I lost my voice. I&nbsp;even send out an e-mail to everyone in the office asking them to e-mail me rather than talk to me cos I would not be able to reply back to them due to my sore throat. Well, that did stop the bitch from approaching me anymore and I simply ignore the e-mails she send me. Girls, they can be quite a bother sometimes. Sensing that I need to get out before I go crazy due to her, I simply put on a sad and stressed face in front of my boss and she approved my half day leave immediately, knowing that she would need me for the financial report in Aug. Clever Woman, at least you know that you should not push ur luck too far. So, I went to Taka for the toy fair and I sms GB abt the toy fair. He dun sound keen but he dun mind coming down to Orchard if I can simply wait for him. It may take him around another 1 and a half hr to come down but I really dun mind waiting for him, cos it's him loh. I would have walk off and have a gd nap if I have to wait that long for others.   Anyway, we walked around the toy fair for a while, did some window shopping around, had a super late lunch at McDonalds, and moved around hunting for some stuff. hehe........ Our last stop was at Times, where he lie on my shoulders for a while. Immediately, I can sense the fast pumping of my heart and I feel so warmed then. It was such a nice feeling loh. Got him a book that he likes. Just feel gd to do something nice to him and get to see him smile. Waited a while for his friend cos I need to rush off for KTV. Can't bear to leave him alone so I stayed with him till his friend turn up. Received 2 sms from him in the evening and I was feeling so warmed by his sms loh.   I think I am so touched by what he did loh. He only send me 2 simple sms and I am alrdy in cloud nine. I am so easily satisfied loh. Guess if anyone would to be my dear, he dun have to do much for me loh, but the I would be bullied by him. hehe.........  Just received another sweet sms from him and I am so happy. Maybe I would have a nice talk with my that female colleague. Oh God! Never know that he had so much effect on me. hehe......... Not going to post anything for the next 2 days since I am not working and I would be meeting GA tonite. Hope that it turns out well. BB is asking me out on Sat and I alrdy agreed liao, so I may only go Nines later in the evening loh.  &nbsp;

      Wow, I am really really very happy yesterday loh. R*** sms me in the afternoon and he agrees to forgive me and be friends again. I am so happy to receive his sms loh and we agreed to meet up for dinner. My Treat. hehe..... I would do anything to have him back as a friend.   We went to Burger King for dinner as usual. Not his favourite fastfood restaurant but I know he dun mind the food. Chicken Whooper meal as usual. I remember that he dun like to eat the tomatoes in the burger so I got the staff to remove it from him. When I told him abt it, he looks surprised that I still remember his likes and dislikes but then I was so excited that I forget that he prefer ice tea to coke. Sigh..... Poor memory liao, but then I must admit that we were acting a bit uncomfortable at first. Guess we need some time to adjust back to being friends again.   We did some window shopping around, looking for his ear stud and comics. hehe... It did not take us long to get back to be as close as before and I must say that I do enjoy being with him loh. We went to get his favourite sweets for his sweet tooth. hehe...... We walked down to Plaza Singapore from Orchard, talking and joking along the way. Played Guilty Gear as usual and at one time, he scratched my leg to get my attention loh. Dun know why, but I feel so nice then and he got that playful and curious look on him, as if to&nbsp;tell me to pay attention to him. Feel so warmed then........ Send him home as usual and the funny thing about both of us is that we keep hinting to each other to find out if the other party is still single. haha..... Throughout the whole nite, I received 2 jealous sms from someone loh, so I showed it to him. He did not have much of a reaction but then he seem a bit cold towards me, or am I imagining things??? Sms him but he never reply. Guess he's busy and I remember how much he hates it if I keep smsing him to get his attention, so I better keep it this way. Would sms him once in a while to check on him but then would not sms him again that day if I never hear any reply from him.  Frankly speaking, I still feel something for him. In fact, I am still very concerned about him and his health. Know that he never make an effort to take gd care of himself and I do hope that he could find someone soon to take care of him.   Just realised that my life is still in a mess, cos I got 3 guys to worry about. ( not including my didi )  R*** - Someone that I once loved deeply. Someone that I would still worry abt. Someone I would still wish to be by his side. ( He's still no ready for ltr, so we may end up in diaster again. )  Jas*** - Someone that care a lot for me. Someone that's very sweet to me. Someone that wish to develop something with me and is serious. ( Find him a bit too possessive liao. Not sure if I would be able to chat so freely with him when we meet up and that forms a kind of pressure for me loh. )  S** - Someone who get me confused of my feelings for him. Someone who give surprises once in a while. Someone who understand me well and make me feel comfortable. ( He's so confused loh. One minute, I am someone he likes, the next minute, I am not his type. And if anything happen, he would always call for me, so what am I to him??? I dun know the answer loh. )   I have feeling for&nbsp;them ( feelings that I am confused abt ) and I admit that each one of them occupy a small space in my heart. I would not mind going steady with any one of them. I am just waiting for something big to happen to make me confirm on my decision. Dun want to rush into things but one month later, I shd be able to know my choice.

      I really can't believe that I log in at 4 am just to update my blog but then so much had happen to me that I think I can't sleep at all loh, so it's better that I do something to make myself feel better. Maybe writing down all my bottled feelings would really make me feel better loh.......    Saturday, 24 July 04    It was quite a busy day for me. I got to work in office and I had planned to go swimming after that, but the weather sucks so I decided to stay at home instead. When I was at home, I actually started to think of Buddy, so I called him up loh. We had a long talk as usual and Buddy actually told me he had some feelings abt me. Am I suppossed to be happy abt it cos I may develop a ltr with him? I dun know cos the next minute, he just hanged up on me. Sigh.......  In between the talk with Buddy, I managed to realise I have a very very messy life. Before I can step into a ltr with anyone, I shd clear all these mess loh and then maybe, things would be much more better. I called up K*** and told him we could only be friends. He was angry with my decision, I dun know cos the next minute, he was telling me that I never give him any chance and I was never better to him than others. In simple words, he feel that I dun care for him at all. Sigh.... We did have a lot of quarrels recently and I just feel that we never get to see eye-to-eye to most of the things which is bad. I dun think a ltr cos I feel that there's a lot of pressure from you and to me, that's a bit demanding. I dun like to sms pple but I try to sms you every morning. I am making an effort to change myself for you and it took me some time to realise that I am doing it as a form of duty rather than something from the bottom of my heart. Sigh.....&nbsp;I know that things are not going to work out well cos I hate arguments and quarrels and I would feel more relaxed if we can only be friends. Sorry k***.  I settle one messy thing in my heart and got things ironed out liao but how come I still cry in the end. Is it b'cos I feel something for it or was it I get to hurt someone again? Sigh.......  In the evening, I went to attend a relative's wedding dinner but then my heart was not in the dinner cos I am going to meet buddy later. Anyway, the dinner sucks but I dun want to write more abt it here. Immediately after the dinner, I rush over to meet Buddy. Got to meet some of his friends and I am glad that I can still mix in well loh. hehe...... Anyway, Buddy got to play with my hp while I was talking to his friends. I didn't bother to check out what did he do to my hp but I would talk abt it later cos it was something very sweet loh. Buddy was not sure if he could make his way home so he passed me his wallet, keys and hp. I was quite touched loh cos he trusted me so much. We got into a cab and I walked him back to his hse when he invited me in. We sat down and talked for a while before he got me out of his hse so that he could sleep. hehe..... On the way home, I played with my hp and I got to notice a new pic being taken. It was a pic of Buddy. So he had been using my hp to take a pic of himself and the sweetest part of it was that he labelled the pic title as "DAR DAR" That was so sweet of him loh. I didn't told him anything abt it at all, cos I was hoping that he could see my reply to this in here. Thanks DAR DAR, that was a very sweet present from you. Muackz..........  Sunday, 25 July 04  Woke up super early although I slept late last nite or shd I say this morning? haha.... Went for a swimming since my student postpone the tuition to 11am. The swim was gd cos the weather was fine. Managed to get myself a nice tan although the pool is so crowded loh.  After tuition, I started to miss Buddy liao but then he's busy with his own work so I leave him alone loh, in case he gets angry with me disturbing him. Anyway, P*** finally called me up liao. I was expecting his call since Sat loh, but then who am I to get angry with him. Afterall, I am supposed to be the most understanding and gd kor. haha..... We chatted for a while and I almost miss the time meeting him up loh. Never realise that both of us still have so much to talk about even though we seldom keep in contact nowadays. We met up and had dinner at Pizza Hut. He managed to finish the meal before and he told me he need to rush off to buy something first and he would be back asap. When he was back, he had actually purchase a coughing syrup for me loh. I was coughing quite badly during the meeting and I am very touched that he got me the cough syrup. I know that P*** is a very gd gd guy but then .......... Sigh........ Anyway, he told me that he's going to watch King Arthur with someone although I did send him a sms few days back, telling him I would watch it with him on the coming Saturday. Guess that the other person is more impt to me, and he may have forgotten abt it, I keep quiet loh. As usual, I got to pack his fieldpack for him and took a cab back camp. The taxi driver was a jerk so I am not going to say much abt him. Idiot!!! During the whole journey back camp, I had a long chat with him. I told him that all this while, I am here for him cos I am waiting for him to find someone to take gd care of him. As I had said before, if the person who I love can't love me back, I would at least wanted him to find true happiness then. I know that we can never be together liao and I think it's time I got to change my this silly love for him to brotherly love. It's difficult but I got to get rid of the crush on him to really start a whole new life and hopefully find love along the way.  P***, I just wanted to let you know that you are still the most impt pple in my life. I treasure you more than anything else cos to me, you are a light in my life. I really think that I can be a gd korkor loh and then I know that you are giving me time to adjust myself back. I really meant it when I said that I would slowly fade away, in the sense that I dun want to sink too deeply in ur life and get myself confused again. I know that it's always a gd feeling to know that I am always here for you and that I would never ever let you down, but then I can only be back after I sort out my life. I would always be here for you cos you are still the one I love most. Wish you all the best, Di.  I got rid of another messy thing in my life liao, but I cried after I send him off to camp. I cried cos it was a hard decision to make all the while, but then it may be the best for both of us loh.  Jas*** called me up and we had a long chat. He was still as nice to me as ever but then I can sense that I had make him upset from the tone of his voice. I hate making pple upset loh. I hate it and I hate myself for doing that. Why must all of you be upset when you are talking to me? Do you know that you are hurting me cos I know that I am the one who caused you to be sad? I hanged up on him cos tears were flowing from my eyes then. Sigh........ During the consveration with Jas***, someone actually send me a Gd Nite sms. R***!!! I was really surprised loh cos I never ever expected him to send me a sms loh. I told myself he must had sms the wrong person but then at least, he still had my number in his phonelist for him to send me wrongly loh if that was the case. I replied immediately to his sms, cos I am really very very happy to receive his sms loh.  Buddy called me up quite late at nite, and I really wanted to ask him a question badly. " Who am I to you now? " " Just a friend " So I was right loh. Buddy and I can't be together at all cos I am not the one he seek. He actually told me a very funny thing. I am giving you marks everyday loh cos you are very very nice to me, but the moment I see you, I fail you. I guess he's trying to tell me my looks or figure sucks or is he trying to tell me that I shd make an effort to always wear contact lens when I meet him up and for god's sake, try to slim down. I dun know what's going on in his mind but then I do know that I did feel a thing or two for him liao ever since I get to know the pic he took in my hp. I dun know what's ur true meaning to tell me all that, but I would make an effort to wear contact lens to meet you up next time and as for the slimming down thing, I would try to make an effort loh.  Conclusion : I cried a lot for this past 2 days and I got myself so troubled that I can't even sleep now. Sigh........ I clear up some of the mess based on what buddy told me. I think that he really meant a lot to me loh since I can listen to him and sort out my mess. In a way, he make me face my deepest fear. I would have never say "Bye" to K***, cos I dun wish to get both of us hurt in the process, but then in love someone is bound to get hurt if things dun work out well. I would never tell P*** " I would only be your kor", cos it's so difficult for me to accept the fact that we can never be together although he's the one I love most. After listening so much to him, in the end, we are just only friends. I must be a damn fool loh..... I think I had enough of all these liao. I would just be myself. If love ever knocks on my door, I would slam the door at it.  Quote : Never ever get urself so tired with all these emotions that you can't fall asleep in the end, cos it's never worth it.  Why be so nice to me when you dun love me? I am a weak player in the game of love and I dun want to get hurt.  &nbsp;

      Had a great day yesterday and there was this little warm warm feeling in me. Is it love creeping up on me? I dun know loh. I am scared. I dun want to hurt anyone and I dun want to get hurted too. I just wanted a happy life with someone by my side. A lot of things were going through my mind yesterday and I am so tired loh. I stand for 3 hours yesterday, waiting and waiting in silence and I am still down with flu and sore throat so I guess, things are not really happening the way I wanted them to ,cos I am sick now, seriously sick loh. ( Sick of getting hurt or &nbsp;physically sick or mentally sick or what?? Sick of being in love and not sure what to do next? )  Seriously speaking, I do crave for love, to be deeply in it. To take care of someone and be always there for him, but then is it possible???  I dun want to get into anything too fast again so I am going to be very&nbsp;slow this time. I want to observe more and then see if anything develop out of it. I am keeping my options open since there are quite a few to consider, so I am going to be fair to everyone. I would just relax and see how loh. The one that's able to make me feel most comfortable shd be able to win my heart as well. hehe......

      OMG! It's finally friday liao and I can get to look forwards to the weekend loh. Really hope to have a nice swim on Sat and get myself a gd tan. Started to really work out on my body and hope to see more results in a few months. hehe.........  I was really tired yesterday loh. Got to know this confused 16 yr guy that just got attached and we were chatting for 2 hours till 1am loh, cos he had some problems with his bf and he dun know how to go about settling it. In short, I think he's feeling insecure abt the ltr and he's so blur and innocent that I really hope his bf is not cheating on him. I dun think my this new found friend can take the setback loh. Buddy called me around 12+, I think he wanted a chat after watching OC, but then sorry loh Buddy. My friend really need me by his side then. After ending the call, I thought I could go and sleep but another friend called up and chatted till 2am+. Finally, got to sleep around 3am loh. Jas*** is going to be so angry when he sees this.&nbsp; Sorry lah, but I just can't go to sleep and leave all my friends alone.  Actually, I am going out today with someone SPECIAL loh, but then never mind lah. He just said that I look scary and I am quite pissed off. haha......... but then I can never be angry for a long period of time. In fact, I wax my hair to meet him today loh but I dun think he give a damn. Sigh.........  Well, something nice did happen during lunch time loh. P*** sms me and told me that he could book out tonite liao. That's so gd loh. Was really hoping that he could get enough time to rest and recover from his cough. In fact, we were planning to watch King Arthur this Sat, but I turned him down. I am so surprised loh. I thought I would agree to anything he said, somemore a movie with him loh, but then I think he needs the rest more than anything else. Better let him have enough rest lah on Fri and Sat. Afterall, he is making a major decision on Sun and I wish him all the best loh, although it's not something that I support. Sigh.......... We agreed to meet on Sun liao so that I can help him pack his fieldpack again. U know lah, he's always so slow and lazy and I got to help him fold his underwear, pack his clothes and squeeze everything into that small fieldpack. Would be taking cab as usual to the camp and bid him good-bye while I make my way to the MRT and take the train home. Maybe we are only meant to be brothers, very close brothers. I really shd not think too much into it anymore.  Interesting Quotes from me : I am the most selfish person in the world, cos when I am nice to you. I am actually expecting you to be nice to me back. haha......... but then who actually bother to be nice to me back???

      Yesterday was a very bad day for me cos I vomit on my way to home and I was feeling so weak loh, Luckily, I got better in the afternoon and I received a pm from Skye, telling me that he's feeling so sian...... haha......... Anyway, I called him up and have a chat with him. Skye did leave a gd impression for me. He's someone deep in thinking, know what he wants, too emotional for normal pple and a bit protective of himself.  Deep in thinking I feel that he thinks a lot everyday, and I think he would sit down and do some serious thinking abt anything whenever he's free. Maybe, that's the main reason why he tries to keep himself occupied? I dun know.  Know what he wants Skye clearly know the way he's heading and I am impressed by the way he admits that he's stubborn and I can still recall, halfway through our consveration, he told me to end a topic cos he feels that we may get into a quarrel since both of us can be stubborn. Cute Guy. Oh yah, and never never try to interrupt him when he's talking to you, cos he would go off in his super fast talking mode that you would just surrender.........  Too emotional for normal people and protective of himself I have that strong feeling that Skye is afraid of hurting others and getting hurt. Sometimes, I feel that he tries to act a bit fierce just in the hope not to know more pple. Knowing more pple always tend to increase the chance of them knowing more secrets and in return, hurting you back. I must admit that talking to him is quite comfortable to some degree and I dun calling him again for a chat but then I am a lazy one............  This is just my impression of Skye and my guess on his character. Guess I am bored but then I find him to be an interesting friend to have loh. Anyway, I meet up with Sea*** tonite and we had quite a nice chat and he gave me a surprise kiss on my cheeks before we parted. That was very sweet of him loh but then I still feel a bit uneasy abt it. Dun intend to let him know. Just hope that he can behave himself a bit better next time or I would have to think twice abt meeting him again. Went home quite late and buddy called me up for a chat after completing his homework. Glad that he's getting better liao. I was so worried abt him loh.  Anyway, give buddy a morning call today cos chatted till 1am yest. nite and I was worried that he may not wake up in time for his school loh. Buddy sms me at 7am, telling me he's feeling better liao and got me to call him up at 7.30am to kill his time while on his way to school, but I was having a flu and sore throat so I can't talk much too and he got me to end the call so I can rest. hehe...... Thanks buddy.  Got to thanks someone here as well beside my buddy, cos he sms me without fail every morning and send me morning kisses. hehe..... So sweet loh. Feel so warmed, receiving such sms in the morning. hehe..... Btw, I am sure yong got nothing against you lah. Stop thinking too much into it.  Quote of the Day => Expectations is the root of all headaches, so dun ever expect anything from me but be glad that I did something for you.

      Yesterday was a horrible day for me, I guess. I got to rush here and there for meetings and then buddy is so sick loh. Keep telling me that he thinks he got to faint liao. How I wish I can go there and force him to see doctor and have a good rest. Anyway, I had&nbsp; a quarrel with him cos he scolded me for being too naggy liao, by including take care in all my sms to him. Sigh.... Care for him, also get scolded. If I know better, I shd just leave him alone loh.  P*** sms me last nite and in a sms, I saw "kor" twice. Sigh..... I am not sure loh. Must I only be a kor to you only? Maybe I shd not think too much liao. Just leave it to nature loh. I am still single and available, waiting for pple to pick me up loh. I may get lucky and get attached the next minute loh. hehe......  Really hope to go somewhere to chat with pple and mix around but I am so poor now loh. I doubt I even have enough money to last me till my pay day. Sigh......... Everytime, buy things for pple and help pple with things until I myself become so poor. Really dun understand myself well enough loh.........

      Buddy is so sick today. Keep wanting me to talk to him to keep him awake but I rather he go and sleep loh. Anyway, just got scolded by him for not paying attention to him. Well, the background noise was very loud loh and I got to concentrate on my work as well. Sigh..... Now, that I got him angry liao, can only call him later to check if he's better liao. So big boi liao still got to make me worry abt him. Sigh..............  &nbsp;  Anyway, decided to post out the requirements to be my stead here. hehe....... If anyone who bother to read on my blog would notice that I choose love, trust, comfort and happiness as my four elements in a ltr. So let's me list it down in detail&nbsp;including my small 4 conditions as well.  &nbsp;  Element of Love  &nbsp;  Love to me can be simple and yet very complicated. I am talking abt the feelings both parties had for each other loh. Love must be from both parties. It may be not equal in quantities but it must be equal in qualities. Some pple often does not know that difference between love and lust so it's gd to know the differences first before u step into one.  &nbsp;  Element of Trust  &nbsp;  I admit that I tend to be a bit demanding in this field. I sort of hate it if someone close to me hide things from me. Sometimes, I know that they hide it from me cos they dun want me to get worried but then I would feel so useless if I am unable to assist and help in any way. I tend to be a bit insecure in terms of feelings so one shd not try to hide too much things for me. It would work out to be something better in the end. I rather prefer a frank person that can open up totally to me.  &nbsp;  Element of Comfort  &nbsp;  To me, I must feel comfortable with a person before I can get into anything closer than friends. There are times when I would not feel comfortable abt. When a person is sad, when a person is angry with me or others, when a person is backstabbing my friends or someone I think that is innocent, when I have to be in a group of strangers, when someone keep talking to me abt some topics that I am not interested in. To me, someone that's able to make me smile and laugh should be able to make me feel comfortable most of the time.  &nbsp;  Element of Happiness  &nbsp;  This is the most difficult elements of the 4, cos there's nothing you can do about it. Happiness and love is like a kind of feeling. To me, love&nbsp;may not go on forever but happiness may be with you forever. I always feel that I rather&nbsp;hear my bf tell me "He's always happy with me around" than "I love u." Being a happy person means that I have proved my love for him, I have cared a lot for him. That's no fault he can find of me as a bf, thus he's always happy.  &nbsp;  Four small conditions = Looks, Body, Time and Patience  &nbsp;  Looks  &nbsp;  I am not really into looks cos I am not gd looking myself. To me, anyone with an avg look would just do the trick. Well, boylish looks do have it's advantages. hehe........  &nbsp;  Body  &nbsp;  I really prefer someone slim, but then I am not really asking for it. An avg body would do just fine as well, cos I would get dear dear to do exercise so we can slim down together loh. hehe...... A smooth body would be gd as well since I get quite turn off by a hairy body. hehe.....  &nbsp;  Time  &nbsp;  I always believe that time can prove a lot of things. Time may prove a person's love of me and I may forgo all the elements and conditions just to be with him, but then we may not last loh cos he still did not manage to&nbsp;pass the basic elements requirements.  &nbsp;  Patience  &nbsp;  I am quite easy-going so I do not expect myself to get angry easily. In fact, I dun think I would ever get angry with my stead cos I love him too much liao. I admit that I am quite petty, so some patience is in place to bear with me loh. I can be quite stubborn too so you got to know the rite way to make me listen to you.  &nbsp;  Finally, finished typing out all the requirements I seek for in a stead. I just hope that I can find someone that I seek soon.  &nbsp;   P***  - Love (x), Time (x) and Patience (x) Think we can only be brothers. Sigh............   Jon*****  - Love (x), Trust (x), Comfort (x), Happiness (x) Fail all 4 elements so he's out of the game liao.   R***  - Love(x), Trust(x), Time(x), Patience(x) He decided not to continue cos I am not his type but I still feel that since we dun have trust liao, it's difficult to move on.   K***  - Comfort (x), Happiness (x) I dun know about him but I can telll that we are not always happy together. Either I get him happy or I misunderstood his msg and get myself angry.   S**  - Love(x) I am not his type and both of us sort of treat each other like buddy but we also know that we are getting&nbsp;a bit too close for comfort&nbsp; liao, but I know&nbsp;he can make a gd brother if he would only just be a bit nicer to me loh.&nbsp;  Jas***  - Dun know yet cos yet to meet up.   Sea***  - He's the one that kiss me as a surprise so I am not sure as to why did he do that.

      Finally got some time now to update my blog of what happen to me yesterday. hehe......... &nbsp; I feel like I am so attached to my blog liao. Like to let my feelings flow freely. Like to write it all out and let my feelings soar high up in the sky. Such a nice feeling.......... &nbsp; I did not had much to update for yesterday but then buddy did called me quite a few times whenever he's free. So sweet of him. I mean I can be quite lazy loh in contacting person. Even for HIM, I only bother to sms him once every nite cos he's in army and he can only read my sms in the nite. Anyway, I think that we really only can be brothers and I stand no chance to be his lover liao so I shd really carry on with my life............. Somehow, I feel that I am so much closer to buddy loh, cos he would call or sms whenever he's free and we are so used to singing to each other at nite. I mean both of us can talk for hours loh and then it's so in depth talking, sharing of problems and laughing over lame silly jokes. haha........... &nbsp; I managed to sms Skye for the first time and he was really cute loh in his sms. He would start and end off each sms with "haha..." I really find it cute loh cos it may means that he likes to laugh a lot which is gd. I hate to see sad or angry faces cos it would make me feel uncomfortable.&nbsp; Anyway, I got to meet someone from the forum and sort of get a surprise from him loh. He asked me to close my eyes and give me a surprise kiss. I was so shocked that I think I fail to react. I just stand there and look at him while he gives me a shy shy look. Sigh....... I was taken advantage by pple liao. I did not have the heart to tell him off but then I make sure I keep my eyes open all the while talking to him. haha.......... &nbsp; If love shd one day come my way, I may not be able to know what to do cos I am so afraid of getting hurt that I may just hide and run away.

      Finally get to log in to my blog and do some updates. Let me think of what shd I update first. Oh yah. The happenings for the past 3 days. Sigh........... &nbsp; Friday, 16 July &nbsp; Life was quite peaceful for me. I know that the guys were meeting up for the coffee outing but I could not go. I just feel that I shd not appear in front of Ryan for sometimes. At least, I must give both of us some time to cool things off, I guess. So I went for shopping alone, which is a bad choice and wasted so much unnecessary time. Sigh....... &nbsp; Decided that what I need is really a break so I headed for home early. Guess what. I received a call from buddy around 10pm, telling me that Kencer managed to read abt my blog and told the others abt me buying Famous Amos for him. Sigh....... That's why I thought a blog should be used for me to pour out my emotions. Now that, I know someone is reading it, I wonder if I can ever be truthful in this blog again. Anyway, buddy was greatly disturbed and I got to keep telling him that it's ok. Sigh.... Alvin and Koon called too cos both are concerned as well. Anyway, the karaoke outing tomorrow was cancelled. Sigh............. &nbsp; Saturday, 17 July &nbsp; Had to wake up early to go to&nbsp;work although I had a phone chat with buddy until 1.30am loh. I am so tired today. Managed to see Jasper's intro and get his hp number from the comment he left. hehe.... Decided to go for a swim in the afternoon since the karaoke was off but then buddy wanted to meet at Taka around 4.30pm for the food fair. Anyway, managed to sms Jasper and get to know him a bit better, really find him a nice guy. I try to finish my swim asap. Anyway, there was hardly any sunlight for me to get my tan. Sigh..... Rush all the way to Taka after my swim, only to receive a call from buddy at 4.30pm, telling me that he just left home. Sigh....... and I have to wait like 1 whole hour for him. Soon Alvin came along and joined us followed by buddy's friend. I must comment that buddy is not very nice to me loh but then I am so used to pple not being nice to me liao. Went with Alvin for his dinner cos he's broke and then to Suntec to collect his pants. Alvin shared with me on a few bad points of me that he dun like. It's gd cos I can see myself in a clearer light that I indeed have a lot of bad points. Sigh.... &nbsp; Went to Nines for a while and by the way I reached home, it was alrdy close to 12.30am. Did not managed to get to sleep cos I am doing some serious thinking. Buddy called me up loh and tell me he's bored and heading for home liao. I told him if he's keen, can always drop me a call. I waited till 1.50am and I thought he's not calling liao so I went to sleep. Later on next day, there's a missed call from him at 2.05am loh. Sigh........ &nbsp; Sunday, 18 July &nbsp; Sunday is usually the day I am looking forwards to the most, cos I can finally get to see HIM after a week and I missed HIM so much. Received a call from buddy at the afternoon and we chatted for an hour plus until he need to take a bath and prepared for his King Arthur movie with someone special. haha........ &nbsp; Went to aunt's place to have a late lunch and wasted my time there cos HE sms me to come over later. Sigh.... Went to PS at around 4.30pm cos HE wanted me to buy some Marks and Spencer Stuffs for HIM. I am so nice to HIM but does HE know why? Sigh........ I reached his place around 6.30pm as instructed by HIM but then HE was not ready yet. I was really angry loh cos after so much chatting with so many pple, I really feel myself as a very cheap person loh, doing so much for HIM and yet HE does not seem to care. Did not have a good dinner with him cos we got to wait for T. T was HIS landlord and a damn slow guy that dun care much loh. I keep reminding HIM that we are late liao loh and T was still as slow as ever. I was very surprised cos I show HIM the black face for that miserable hours we can spend together. When we were on our way back to camp, HE try to talk to me but I just ignore HIM and it hurts loh. Sigh......... We did manage to talk a bit while we were quite close to the camp. HE asked me to watch King Arthur with HIM on Sat when he booked out, cos HE wanted to spend some time with me, to stop making me think too much. I know that HE's gd to me but then if we can only be brothers, then dun be too gd to me. I can't take it loh. HE alrdy knows that I carry a torch for him, and by being nice to me, it's as gd as leading me on.............. &nbsp; If u remember my quotes, I am alrdy hurt cos HE's the one I love but he does not love me at all. Now, I can only wish for him to find true happiness so that I can avoid getting hurt again. &nbsp; Buddy, I remember to go and cut hair with you loh, but if you totally forget abt it, then dun blame me loh. Sigh........... &nbsp; Koon, I just want to say I am sorry for not picking up ur call but then I dun like to cut a person off by picking up another's call. That's y I tend to end ur call before picking up any other calls. Hope u can understand. Sigh........ Why am I always making pple angry? &nbsp; After chatting with so many pple, I manage to draw a conclusion. I am not someone great. I am not someone nice. I am not someone with an interesting life. I am someone that would never have a chance to fall in love. If I have any admirers which I doubt, I think they dun understand me well enough to see how bad I am. For those that had rejected me, there's only one word from them to me. JERK!!!!! I am so tired from moving around, seeking and searching for true love. I just need something simple. Maybe I shd follow my buddy and set my criterica..............

      Life sucks big time in office and I got to change my job liao. I was always thinking that I should move on, get a new job, have a new life but then it's so difficult loh. Sigh................ &nbsp; I forget to mention Thanks to xxkakaxx for linking me up to his blog, so now I got 2 close buddys liao. Jasper and Sam. hehe....... Anyway, Jasper, do pm me in the forum lah so I know who are you and we can chat more loh. Know that u got hint hint me about buying food for you and going to school to find you. Well, that would have to depend on the time you dismiss from school loh cos I knock off at 5.30pm everyday and if you are too far away from me, I may not reach you in time. I also prefer to give small surprises than arranging it nicely. &nbsp; Jasper - You had been a great pal and I really want to say thanks to you. I really appreciate the help and words of advise from you although I never really get to chat with you and express my deepest thanks to you. I hope that you would be able to read this cos it's the only way I can reach out to you. &nbsp; He shd be able to book out tomorrow liao. Think that he would need some rest and go clubbing but then I would still&nbsp;make myself available&nbsp;just in case he needs me.&nbsp; With so many things happening to me, he's the dearest person I have now and I can only do my best to ensure that he's safe and happy. &nbsp; Quotes of the Week => &nbsp; Situations when you would feel sad. &nbsp; 1. When a person you fall in love with dun love you at all. &nbsp; 2. When the person you love fails to find happiness. &nbsp; Somehow, I feel that we can only become brothers. Maybe I shd be content with it and move on. Maybe you are just not the right one for me and I wanted you to find your true happiness.

      Sigh......... I didn't have any chance to post anything yesterday cos life in office sucks. I had so many things to rush and that bloody bitch can just go off in the afternoon. Supposed to have a meeting with her today but she's on mc. In the end, I got to cover her part during the meeting and got to help her clear her shit and then help her remove her half day leave from the leave system. Really hate her to the core. Everytime can find extra work for me to clear for her. Sigh...... &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Some updates abt what happen yesterday??? Yesterday was a damn lousy day. I managed to know that xxkakaxx is having lessons in class till 8pm so I decided to go down and pay him a visit at Sp. Really hope that it would cheer him up. At 5pm, it was already raining cats and dogs and I am still deciding if I shd make the trip down to SP which is so bloody far loh, but then I think it's worth it to go down and pay this little friend a visit. Walked in the rain and get myself bloody wet, which really gets on my nerves and then took the MRT to Boon Lay. Planned to get xxkakaxx some Famous Amos cookies, know that he likes them and thought that he would be hungry after spending so much time in sch. Managed to reach SP around 7.30pm. Send him 2 sms, telling him that I am already here but then there was no reply from him. Call him up and there was no reply. Was thinking that he might had go home before I get to see him and his friends coming towards Dover MRT Station. Dun want to cause any strange misunderstandings with him and his friends, I followed him and boarded the MRT down towards Boon Lay again. Sian...... Only managed to talk to him when we were in Jurong East Station cos his friend alight at this stop. He was a bit surprised to see me but then his attitude towards me was so cold loh. He refused to accept the cookies and just alighted at Chinese Garden with a "bye". Got this sms from him asking me to trust and treat him like a normal person. I was like ," OMG!, did I do something wrong again?" Sigh...... Just thinking of maybe giving him a surprise and if possible, have dinner together loh. Didn't know that he could be that cold loh.  Just managed to read his blog today and not sure if these few lines quoted from his blog refer to me. hehe........     today i hurt a person who doesn't know how he feels about me    Wow! Is he trying to tell me he hurt me? Well, he did loh cos I make so much effort to go down and give him a surprise and he treat me so coldly. Bad xxkakaxx. haha......    another note to suitors out there: please be more clever & think carefully before making any actions. i can be veri evil if i want to. especially when i put studies as my first priority... try to make mi happy when you think i deserve it. you might only win my heart when i'm done. but seriously la, i won't be that sad easily. =D    Well, I think this is a warning for me loh. Telling me that he can be very evil if he wants to. haha.... but then I meant no harm lah. Think too much liao loh. Anyway, he send me a sms today telling me that we better keep our distance. I was quite shocked cos why would he want to keep a distance from me. Did I do anything wrong again? Sigh..... I am like so tired loh. It seems that I am forever, doing wrong things to cause pple to run away from me. I was really some kind of demon loh...... haha.........  Oh, I almost forget to mention that I was very very naughty yesterday. I was moaning over to someone over the phone *Blush* and I think I got him so high that he got to settle some problems later. hehe....... So, was it gd for u yesterday nite? Sorry loh cos I was a bit high too. hehe...

      Time flies and I did not have a chance to really update my blog since I am never online when I am at home. I prefer to go online when I am in office. Maybe that's b'cos I needed something else to kill time, beside working so hard and getting so many complains from that fucking bitch. Oh dear, I got to mind my language in my blog. Naughty Wesley, U shd watch ur tongue. haha.............  Got to update quite a lot of things since I miss out updating for quite a few days.  Friday 09 July 04  Decided to meet xxkakaxx up, maybe for dinner, a chat or whatever, as long that someone can just spend some time with me. We agreed to meet at Jurong Point since I would be able to buy the Famous Amos cookies for him. It's his favourites and I do want to leave a gd impression. haha........ Was really looking forwards to it but then damn it. That bloody bitch got to call me up and give me a fierce scolding just before 5pm. Got me so boiling mad that my ears turn red with anger. Sigh..... At 5.15pm, xxkakaxx sms me to say that he dun wish to wait for me at Jurong Point and he prefer to go home first. Well, I am ok with that so I decided to go to buy the cookies at Jurong Point ,then make a trip down to his house to pass it to him.  Waited for him at the bus-stop near his house, and xxkakaxx appeared in home clothes. Looked so cute. haha..... Passed him the cookies but he never even thanks me for it. :x But then he wanted to pass me something from Bread Talk. Not sure what's it, but I had been avoiding eating such stuffs so that I dun gain any additional weight. I just to reject him politely but he keep trying to passing it to me that I just board the next bus that come away. Sigh........ Bad choice cos it makes my journey home bloody long. I did get to see xxkakaxx storming off when I board the bus, so I called to check if he's ok. That guy actually slammed my phone 4 times in a row. It was after some sms that he decided to pick up my call and talk to me again. Sigh...... He chatted and sung to me on my journey home and the whole call time was 45 minutes loh. OMG! I dun dare to think of my hp bills when it comes. Sigh...... Got to sleep early tonite to prepare for the big day tomorrow.  Saturday 10 July 04  Today is the big day for me. I finally get to see pika after 17 days liao. How I miss him. Wonder if he's ok, did he slim down? In fact, I was so excited about it that I woke up at 5.30am, so kaisu, really typical singaporean. hehe...... I received a sms from pika at 6.15am, asking if I had woke up, and am I really to go over liao??? haha...... Didn't know that he would be so excited to actually see me again. hehe... Feel so warmed when I received that sms although he keep stressing that he dun need anything cos he only want me to help him carry stuff. Anyway, I did reach the camp early but then I only got to see him at 9.45am although I reach the camp at 8.30am. Stupid army, never change. After so long, still so slow in logistics. Anyway, we took a cab back home and I got to keep remind him to do this and do that. Really make me sound like a old nag. Had lunch with him and Titus before moving to Orchard to meet xxkakaxx and Lao Shi.   After some window shopping and looking at delicious food, Lao Shi needs to go to gym to tone up his body and we meet up Alvin as well. Koon called and both of them decided to go Nines to meet Koon up but I decided to stay in Orchard cos pika mentioned that he may come down to HMV later to buy some stuff. I stayed and waited till 5.30pm and when I called pika up, this sleeping beauty is still deep in sleep loh so I decided to make my way down to Nines instead to meet xxkakaxx and Koon. Dropped by Famous Amos to buy some cookies for xxkakaxx, just in case something happen. Well, something did happen and I am glad the cookies did their small magic as well. Got xxkakaxx to cool down a bit but then he slammed my phone 3 times again today. Sigh.... Up to now, he's the only one that I talked to 2 days over the phone and get to slammed my phone 7 times in a row. Sigh... Why do I have to see bad things happening everyday in my life???  Sunday 11 July 04  Woke up early cos I remember I have to meet pika to go Beach Road to buy some army stuff. Not sure what time would he be meeting me but then it's better that I get myself ready first. Well, he gives me a missed call around 1pm and we decided to meet at Lavendar Mrt Ctrl Station at 3pm. Something happened at home and I am greatly affected by it. Shared with pika about my problem and he did managed to cheer me up for a bit. Ate a bit of snacks in Beach Road and shopping for army stuff was fun. I guess I was the one doing most of the shopping loh cos pika tends to be a bit shy and reserved. haha..... We did get all the things we needed and then we headed home, went out for dinner. After dinner, I got to help him pack his field pack, fold his clothes for him, adjust his smart 4 for him. Sigh.... Feel so much like a maid. Managed to squeeze in everything for him, and then we took a cab back camp. Both of us sort of agreed to meet every sunday so I can pack his fieldpack and send him back camp. At the camp, I had to bid him gd bye cos it would be another 6 more days before I get to see him again. Sigh... Start to miss him liao. haha...... Well, I did alight at the camp too cos taking cab home would cause a bomb and I am on real tight budget. While on my way back, Koon and xxkakaxx called. Had a small chat with Koon and as for xxkakaxx, he only wanted a listening ear for his concert. I know that his tears were flowing while he's singing but too bad that I can't be of much help to him. Chatted with him for a while, and when he mentioned me his friend is calling him now, he just slammed my phone without saying bye. I was like WTF! How can you treat me like that? but then strange enough, I was never angry with him. Maybe he's special lah. haha..........  Monday 12 July 04  Nothing much to appear except that I am very very sad. Went to see a doctor cos I had a fever and there were fresh red blood in my discharge. *Gross* That stupid doctor actually struck something up my ass to check if I am ok and it was bloody painful loh. Luckily I never scream and the worst part was the doctor was an old lady. haha......  Only a few guys got to know abt my situation and some called to express their concern. I was really quite touched loh and I must say thanks to all of you. I did some serious thinking recently. That guy was alrdy seeing someone again and picking up his life. Why shd I still cry over him at nite? He's not worth it loh. He keeps blaming me that it's me who over react to things but then he never realise that he's the one that shut me out even though he wanted to try a ltr with him. How much funny can it get??? Attempting a ltr with someone and shutting him out from ur life, does it work this way??? Since u r so happy with ur current life now, I dun wish to step in again but then it's time I pick myself up and start life afresh.  Tomorrow would be a better day cos I know that someone would be there for me.

      Can you believe it? He actually call me up today. I am so surprised that he called me up and it took me quite some time to decide if I shd pick up his call. I picked up and the first thing I got from him was "Are you evil??? in the forum?" I was like so puzzled at his question. I alrdy mentioned that I would not be in the forum anymore and I meant it. In fact, I am only keeping contact with Simple_Life, xxkakaxx and Asaki and they are the ones that update me of any happenings in the forum. I dun even know of any guys by that nick. If that's the way he's going to think, I got nothing much to say.  The next thing is that he's asking me whether I had the intention to apology to him. Sigh...... I admit that I really do want to apology to him cos I also know that it was wrong of me to do that but then I am always not gd at handling such issues so I ask xxkakaxx and Simple_Life for advise. Both of them agree that he's angry now and I should just wait loh and call him when he's better to apologise to him. I told him that but then I dun think he can tell that I am sincere about it. I told him about the thing that I plan to give him through xxkakaxx and Simple_Life on the coffee outing but then he turned me down immediately and asked me to keep the card and bear for myself....  Sigh..... Why did I cause hurt and harm him again? Am I really such a jerk? I dun understand myself anymore and I pity the way I deal with things and cause more troubles along the way. I really thought that since he's so angry with me, it would be slightly better if I pass him the bear and card next week. I am sincere in expressing my apology to him but I dun think he can sense it from me. I am really very tired now... Does he know what I am going through too? Someone u like told u on Wednesday that he likes you and want to try out a relationship with you and then in a week's time, he told you the truth that both of you can't be together. I am like speechless for words. I never intend to take revenge although he had it in his mind. I am just trying to find some peace in my time and getting a hold of myself. I would not come back to the forum again as it's not a place for me lah. Maybe I need to find comfort in some other places and lead on a simple, peaceful life. Nothing more that I wish for or want........  I only want you to know that I would call you up tml and sincerely apologise to you for my mistake. I still hope that you can forgive and let me be there for you as a friend. I can't do much but I know that at least up to this point of time, I still care a lot abt you. Sigh.........

      I cried and cried the whole of yesterday afternoon. I was so surprised that I could cry for so long. I was in office then and my tears just flow down my cheeks slowly while I am wearing a smile on my face. Everyone thought that I must be mad. Even I think that I am mad.......  When I had a chat with Koon, I did shared with him that I wanted to buy something from R's wishlist. I hoped that he would accept the things I got for him and I plan to ask Koon and Sam for help to pass it to him on the next coffee outing. I did not want to go for it cos the angel in me is already dead....  I know that deep inside my heart, I still feel a lot for him. I wanted to be there for him but then I can only hide my feelings now cos both of us are just not ready. I dun blame him for his decisions but then I just can't help feeling sad and keep crying.... I still hope that we can be friends so that I can still watch over him from an angle but then I need some time to recover. He seem so ok now so I guess he was not as affected as me by what happened yesterday.........  Maybe I really do not deserve true love.......

        You're a Caramel!!  You are known for your sweetness. You are comfortable with yourself, and help others feel the same way about themselves.  You are generally friendly to everyone, and believe in second chances.      urlLink   Which kind of candy are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Never know if I am known for my sweetness. haha.... Anyway, life had been quite ok for me lately. Time just seem to pass so slowly. How I wish it's friday now and I can get to see someone immediately. hehe......  I had a rather long chat with someone over the phone yest. Quite surprised cos it's the first time I call him up on his hp and in the end, we were like chatting for 2 whole hours loh. Ok, I am amazed at the length of time we spend chatting and the jokes and laughter we shared throughout the whole consveration. I must admit that I did enjoy myself chatting with him and in the end, I had to wake up early to give him morning call for school. haha..... Luckily, I did wake up in time to give him morning call loh.

Jonathan was a 17yr old guy that had a crush on me but I am not quite willing to step into anything with him although he's quite cute looking. I still remember once we went out for dinner. I told him that I am facing financial difficulties and we shd have something cheaper but he insists on dining at Pizza Hut. In the end, I paid for everything and was left with only $7. After dinner, he insists that I send him home which I agree. Once we reach the MRT Station, he complained that he dun have enough cash on his e-Link card so he took my wallet from me, emptied it of the $7 I have and top up his e-Link card with another $3 from him. I still send home and went home with a empty wallet. He did promised to pay me back the money and I believed him..........  The next time he met me up, he forked out $25 and asked me to place a bet for him on the Euro match. Weak and poor at rejecting pple, I helped him placed the bet. It was only after the bet that I realised that he used up every single cent in his wallet to place the bet. I was so angry with him. I questioned him on the money he promised to pay me back and he just ignored me. In the end, he scolded me in public and caused me to cry. I cried not because I was being scolded but someone that once told me that he loved me can hurt me so much. He called up yesterday and beg for me to be friends with him again and see if we can develop into a relationship. "Sorry if I hurt you deep cos I really do care and concern 4 u. I really appreciate what u have done 4 me. I really can't live without u in my life. U r someone I cherish most." Sigh.............  Why am I hurting someone back now although it was me that got hurt at first?  Am I not a gd lover cos true love seem so near but yet so far away?  Maybe I dun deserve any good things in this world.

        cuddle and a kiss on the forehead - you like to be close to your special someone and feel warm, comfortable, and needed    urlLink   What Sign of Affection Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I had a long talk with someone last nite and I get to learn something more from him.  " Love is like holding sand in ur hands. If u hold on tightly, the sand would rub against ur hand and cause pain, If u hold on loosely, the sand would slip through your fingers. "  Maybe I am giving him too much pressure liao, I must really learn to relax and see how things go. I am not sure if I am the right one for him, but for the time being, I feel that I shd treat him as a friend and maybe lessen my expectations of him. When ever my phone ring or give a beep, I thought it was him calling me or smsing me but then, I am always disappointed. Sigh......  Just hope that I can announce to the world one day that we are together liao and I would protect him from all harm.

      Hi, I had not been updating for quite some times cos a lot of things had been going through my mind. I am so confused and disturbed now. He knows that I love him and he told me he is willing to give it a try. I promise not to give him any pressure but then things are not going on smoothly for us, I think.  We meet up on Friday for dinner and movie. Everything was great at first, or was it??? I am not sure. We did manage to hold hands when we are watching the moive. It was such a sweet thing cos I can sense him grabbing my hand tight. I feel so warmed and in love by his gesture. I was also floating in the air and I can't be even bothered on what's showing in the screen. When we moved out of the cinema, I can sense some sadness from him. Some deep hurt that he's hiding from me but his expressions say it all. I can't get him to share his pain and hurt with me and I feel so useless for that moment of time. When he did shared with me, the moive reminded him of his ex. Someone who left him without a reason, someone who can't be bothered to tell him the reason why. I can tell that he still love his ex very much and I am wondering to myself, "Would I ever lose this one that I love so deeply?" I find out that I dun have the answer to my question cos I am not even sure of my status with him. All I know is that I can only wait and try to let him see that I am serious in him and I would not do anything to hurt him. Sigh.........  On Saturday, I went shopping with my family and I got to see this real nice cute "thingy" Can't write what is it down here cos I plan to give it to him on friday. Not sure if he would like it but it's not cheap. Buying it means I have to simply eat biscuits for lunch for a few days but then I think it's worth it to get something nice for him, cos I always wanted to give him something nice.  Reading upon his blog today, I know that he at least cry 2 times out there. Not sure of what to do abt it, I did call him up but I guess he was at home liao so he didn't get to pick up my call and reply to my sms. Sometimes, I wonder if he's finding me a nusiance, keep smsing him to make sure he's ok and sometimes calling just to have a short chat with him.  Do u know that actually, I am feeling very sad now cos I know that he can't accept me now, and give me a chance to be really there for him, taking care of him, protecting him and ensuring that he can be always happy and cheerful. I dun know what's going through his mind but I know that I wish to help him as a lover, love him as a lover, protect him as a lover and care for him as a lover. I would do anything for him as long that I can remove that pain and hurt in his heart, to see his happy cheerful face again.  Not sure if u would get to see this, but I just want to say this. I am willing to wait for u till u r ready.....

      Actually, I was quite disturbed yest. when I was reading 2 of my friends' blogs. I must say that both of them are undergoing something bad and I really dun know how to help as a friend. When it comes to affairs of the heart, I think that the only thing I can do is to listen but then I am not even sure if it does help a single bit. Sigh.....  Feel real sad that such things had to happen to them and I know that they did cried a lot cos it's a painful decision to make. Sigh... In a relationship, empty voids may appear due to the fact that your partner did not fulfil the requirements you wanted or seek in a lover, and when someone comes dangerously close enough and starts to fill up the empty voids, the relationship just start to fall apart slowly. It's like you are hoping to receive something from ur lover but someone always manage to give it to you before ur lover does. As time passes, you would feel something for that guy that can be always there and meeting ur requirements. Hence, time can really prove one love for another.  Actually, every ltr has it's empty voids in it due to our expectations from the other party. We are all humans and we tend to think more for ourselves than for others. I admit that there are times that I get angry over deardear for not replying to my sms but then it's really my fault loh, cos I am the one expecting a reply. If I dun expect a reply from him in the first place, then I would not be unhappy with him at all. Sometimes in life, it's easier to simply accept things as what it is then having things done the way you want. There's no such things as perfect in this world so we must all learn to give and take.  I guess all of us have to really learn in terms of maintaining a ltr and ensuring that everything goes on smoothly. Afterall, we are all beginners compared to those that had a ltr for years. I only know that I love deardear very much. hehe........ Muackz......

      I am very happy today. In fact, I never stop smiling since last nite. hehe...... When I was chatting with BK, the 1st thing he noticed is that I sound extremely cheerful and he could tell that it must have something to do with deardear. Well, I was happy to receive deardear sms mah, so I sound a bit cheerful loh and I am still smiling now. hehe......  I am still thinking if I shd join BK and be a waiter at Swiss Hotel? but then I am alrdy giving tuition to 2 students and I would have totally no time for deardear liao. Really in need of more money loh. In fact, I think I better manage my money better from next mth onwards or I would be really eating bread for lunch everyday liao. Luckily I am getting my tuition pay today and alrdy, I have some payments in mind for that sum of money liao. Meeting deardear on friday and I am debating if I shd take half day leave. Maybe I shd take lah since I have annual leave of 21 days, and thanks to that bitch, I have only clear 6 days of last year annual leave. Sigh..... Would talk to boss abt my half day leave later when she's back and get her to approve it immediately. Would be on course next Mon and Tue so I would not be coming back to office to see that bloody bitch and the best part is they provide free lunch. Finally, 2 days without bread for lunch liao. hehe.........

      I am quite happy today cos I get to find a long lost friend yest. It was quite funny loh cos I was scaning through my friendster record and I really wanted to increase my friend list, so while I was scaning through one of my Pri Sch friend's friend list, I managed to find this long lost Sec Sch friend of mine. hehe..... Added him and he approved it immediately. So nice. haha......  Well, we exchanged hotmail account and was soon chatting over msn. He was my sch mate back in Sec Sch and I got to know him cos my best friend was in his class. Anyway, he was really nice to everyone in his class and I guess we sort of click on quite well whenever I pop over to his class. Him laughing and shaking his head due to my childish behaviour and funny character??? Well, I am still childish now. haha........ During the consveration, I checked out his friend list in friendster and guess what. I saw BaiLong's profile in it, oh ok. Could it be that my friend is also one of us too? Never thought that he could be one since he's quite str8 acting in Sec Sch, but then he could have just discovered himself in a later part of his life. haha........ So I just sort of come out to him and yes, he's one of us. haha........ He was quite happy for me that I was attached, simply feel that I could give my bf happiness. Well, I know that I would do my best to give deardear happiness since I alrdy give him my heart liao. hehe..... Seem that this friend of mine had some problems from previous ltr and got hurt cos he keep telling me that he's seeking for short term ltr or ONS. So sad. I really hope that he can get to know some nice guy and get attached loh. Always believe that love can really change a person totally. Well, I may bring him out for an outing if there's ever going to be one in the first place. The forum seem so quiet now. haha.....  Really hope that someone can start planning for an outing soon. I feel so bored loh. Anyway, for those that are reading my blog and keen to be my friends, add me at friendster leh. I need more friends. hehe......... My e-mail address is  urlLink jkcs1902@hotmail.com  Wondering how's deardear doing now. Guess he must be damn busy since I never receive sms from him for 2 whole days liao. Sigh..... Just got to get used to it loh. Maybe he would send me a sms tonite. hehe..... Can't wait to meet deardear up on friday liao. Miss u....

      So much happen since the last day I updated my blog. My mood is not that good loh cos I had been crying to sleep for the past few days. I sort of get reminded of some unhappy incidents and my tears just start flowing. Was planning to meet deardear today but then both of us had a busy schedule and I try to book him on friday liao. Really really hope to see him soon loh. I miss him so much. Arh.....  I start to regret a bit on updating my blog of my personal feelings but then it's my life and I have nothing to hide but I dun expect pple to pay special attention to my blog and make use of it. Sigh...... GA, u r very clever indeed. From my posting, u can tell that deardear dun chat with me over the phone at all and he dun have the tendency to reply to my sms and u make gd use of it. Thanks for the sms u send me everyday, it's very sweet of u but then I think someone out there deserve it more than me. Such sweet sms are just not meant for me. Dun use words like " Muackz" in ur sms to me anymore if u still value the friendship we have. I dun mind chatting with u on the phone when u r down cos I still treat u as a friend in need but calling me everyday and telling me u miss me is not rite loh. To make things simple, I know that u can be a very gd bf from the day I know u but then there's a very simple reason why I choose deardear over u. Deardear is the ONLY one in my heart and that feeling is going to last.  I admit that I feel horrible when deardear dun reply to my sms, but that's him and I dun want him to change for me. I love him and I have learn not to expect any reply from him. It's a hard process for me cos I am not used to it. There are times that I would be checking my hp every 5 minutes hoping that it's him replying. There are times that I would jump in joy hearing the message alert tone and being disappointed once I realised that it's not him. Such are the times I have to go through and it's not a nice feeling. I am still trying to change my expectation of him and it's slowly improving. I can't stop myself from smsing him cos I miss him everyday and we dun get to chat at all until the time we meet. I do envy those couples that could at least have a chat a day or at least a gd nite sms from each other every nite cos that's so sweet, but then I still think that deardear is the best although we have neither of the both mentioned above. GA, I believe that u can sense my deep love for deardear is not going to change no matter what u do, so I suggest u spend more time with others. U would also find a true love soon and u would be treasuring it like I do now.  Quote : Communication could be a must in some relationships, but then words would be useless if we express our love through our hearts. It's a form of understanding, trust and committment.

      I am so happy today. Guess it must be brought forwards from the happiness I had yest. hehe....  Was on half day lve yest, so went home early for a short break and meet deardear up at PS around 4 plus since deardear's class end around 3. Meet deardear liao and we go Carrefour for some window shopping. Deardear keep asking me why am I so quiet cos he's not used to it. haha.... Well, I had some problems at hand to settle and I was a bit troubled. Dun want deardear to worry abt me so I keep quiet mah. Anyway, deardear did get something he wanted during the shopping so I hope he's happy. I do know that he's happy cos he was smiling almost the whole day and he looks so charming with that killing smile. My heart almost melted whenever he looks at me and smile or stick his tongue out in a playful manner. haha.........  I told deardear that I am not going to sms him anymore liao since he never reply to my sms. He sort of get a bit anxious, hehe..... when he hears that. Anyway, I would never stop smsing u lah even if u dun reply to my sms. Sometimes, I do get worried mah when I never hear anything from u. Actually I never tell deardear why I only sms him but I never call him up. Well, the reason is quite simple. I got bombed once when I try to call him. He must be busy cos he hanged up on me and the next minute I got a simple sms from him.  " Why do u call me? What's so urgent that u must call me? Do u know that there's something call sms? "  Although it happen quite some time back, before we even get attached, I never forget this incident so I always make it a point not to call him up unless it's urgent. I personally think that it's better this way too cos I dun want to add on to deardear's phone bills. If he had allowed me to call, I may call everyday loh which is also not gd. hehe......    I told deardear that I got 8 impt words to tell him and the first 5 words are  " I dun like u anymore. "  As for the next 3 words, u r going to guess loh. haha....     Sometimes, I find deardear so cute and funny cos he said that I send him too much sweet sms liao and he would rather prefer a simple one and he seldom say or sms me, telling me he loves me. So bad of him, rite? Always bully me. I dun care loh. I would still send him sweet sms once in a while. hehe.... and one day just one day, I am going to make him say " I love u" to me in public ( maybe got to make him shout it out ). haha... I feel so warmed with deardear yest. and I really want to thanks him for making me a part of his life and allowing himself to be a part of my life. Dear, I love u. Muackz......

      I just found out that I have nothing at all to update in my blog. Not that there's nothing to update but the there are so much emotions in me that I find it hard to put it down into words. Would it help then if all my feelings and thoughts are in here? Would it change anything? Would I for once feel slightly better and have a happy life?  Everyone is craving for a simple life. Me too. I also wish for a simple life, a simple love.  Life itself can never be simple cos humans are just so complicated and everyone's life evolves around such complicated creatures. Creatures that are so ugly deep inside their heart, Creatures that have no sense of what they really want, Creatures that are forever demanding and craving for things. Sometimes, I pity us for being the superior creatures but yet we can't rid ourselves of worries, problems and troubles we created for ourselves. I wonder did God ever regret creating us in the first place cos I always believe that he created the world before he created humans, and isn't it funny now that the humans he created is destroying the world he created in the first place for them? haha......... but then again all humans are evil by nature and they can't escape from temptation, be it power, money, or lust. Well, I hate to admit but I fall under the temptation of someone now and that's deardear cos everything abt him just catch my heart. hehe........  I crave for a simple love, something simple but yet sweet. Just want to cook something with him and enjoy a meal, just want to have him on my lap while I play with his hair, just want to hug him whenever he's down, just want to cuddle him and whisper sweet words to his ears, just want to make his everyday a beautiful day. haha... I sort of tell deardear this before but he thinks that it's too fairy tales liao. Well, I really believe that it would come true loh cos I have faith in my love for u, deardear. I really do love u with all my heart. Muackz....  I am really looking forward to tomorrow cos I have a half day leave. Time for me to take a break. haha.....

      What a gd timing that I choose to update my blog. haha......  Sunday  I went for my swimming as usual and I was being cruised. haha... That definitely comes as a surprise and that guy was so damn cute. Yummy.... Come to think of it, it was really funny loh. As usual, the pool was crowded and a few lanes were set aside for continuous lap swimming. That's what I like abt hougang pool. I was swimming forwards and before I know it, someone was brushing across my body and his hands sort of hit me on my head. Orh... That was painful and that someone did stop his swimming and keep apologising. I was almost going to curse and swear at him when I realise that he was such a beauty. He looks yng and he got such a nice tan on his body. Wow.. and his puppy eyes looking at me, begging for forgiveness. That's so cute loh. haha... Anyway, it was not very painful and he looks too damn cute for me to get angry at so I just say that it's ok and continue on my swimming. Finished my 20 laps and decided to take a short break so I sort of just lean against the side wall of the pool. Was just closing my eyes and intending to rest when I sense someone touching my arms. I opened up hands and saw cutie again. He tries to start a consveration with me by asking if I just feel pain on my head and then he moved on to intro himself which is interesting. haha..... Not trying to be unfriendly, I did sort of chat with him and for some parts of the consveration, I did sense his legs rubbing against mine. Not feeling comfortable with him now, I make up an excuse and head for the showers. Cutie head for the showers with me too and he actually occupy the cubicle next to me. Oh ok, so what does he want now? I am sure he must be making a mistake on me so I just took a quick shower and head for the exit. Cutie did managed to complete his shower in time too to catch up with me, so we exit the swimming pool together. He got to walk beside me and ask if I would be interested to go over his hse. I was like ," Why r u so nice to me? I only get to know u today, u know?" He blush and replied, " Well, I sort of know u but I dun think u remember me. U know Gerald from MXXXXXXX Sec Sch? I am his younger brother and I sort of saw u having fun with my kor before and I was thinking if you want to, u know do it for me?" haha...... That really came as a shock. Gerald was my sex buddy when I was in Sec Sch and I never knew that his younger brother spy on us when we did it in his room and is actually making a move on me now. haha...... I just told him that he's indeed very cute but I would not have any fun with him cos I am alrdy attached liao. Anyway, sorry cutie, but you can always count on me as a big kor to give u advise. hehe........ ( Sorry but I got to leave out cutie's name to protect him. )  Monday  I didn't receive a single sms from deardear and I am worried. Wanted so much to ask him if he's ok but then, he could be busy with his own things. Thus, he didn't sms me at all or reply to my sms. Is it too much of me to just expect a single sms from you everyday to let me know that u r ok? Sigh......  I wanted to give a warning to someone that I know would be reading my blog. I totally trust my deardear and I hope that u would not speak ill of him again in front of me. Sometimes, I find that u r so scary loh cos u dun even know my deardear and u r trying to bad-mouth him in front of me? I still treat u as a gd friend loh and I hope it would remain this way. In your eyes, you may think that you would make a better bf than deardear and u may think that u would treasure me more than deardear, but I never regret choosing deardear over u. U r unique in ur own ways too and I am sure someone out there would see how gd u r. For now, we are gd friends and would always be cos I would always be attached to deardear.  Quote : Never compare love cos every love is different and unique in it's own way. Be happy in the love u found cos it belongs to only u and the one u love.

      Can U believe it? I am updating my blog at 3am plus. Well, I am really very very very happy yest. Someone sms me at 11am and we agreed to meet around 2pm. It was great loh cos I miss him so much. We managed to talk for a while and I did get to know more abt him and I also need to do some slight adjustments to myself. I was so happy when I saw him that I admit I started to act "very close" to him in the mrt and I can understand better now why did he feel uncomfortable. He also told me that he tend to be quiet sometimes but there's nothing wrong and I must agree that I had come to accept him being quiet. At first, I was feeling uncomfortable when he's so quiet towards me but during the journey back, I just simply enjoy his accompany. It was then that I realised it does not matter if he's quiet or talking to me or whatever, I just want to be there beside him and the feeling is so wonderful.  We watched the movie "the village", and I must say that the movie was ok but it's a bit too draggy. Not recommended for pple who are expecting a horror movie. From the movie, I actually get to know something impt, cos there was this quiet guy and his crush was asking him questions, hoping that he could tell her he love her. If my memory dun fail me, I can still manage to remember a few meaningful lines.   Girl : You used to hold my hands when we were yng. U stopped when u were 8 years old and I dun know why. I still remember once that I tripped in front of u, of course I did it on purpose, hoping that you would hold my hands once again but NO, u didn't hold my hands. Why is it sometimes in life we want to do something, but we do not do it cos we know that others can tell we would do it? Would you dance with me when we are married? I find dancing very interesting...      Boy : Why are all of you trying to make me talk? Does it make a difference if I tell u everything, my thoughts, my feelings? Fine, I would tell you everything then. I am sitting in this couch cos I am worried abt u, and for ur last question, YES, I would dance with you when we are married.   I can't recall much but that is basically what I can remember. It was then I realised that how impt is communication to everyone. If he did not share with me his likes and dislikes today, I may have carry on doing it and cause more harm to the situation. In fact, I told him to tell me all the things I did which would make him feel uncomfortable so that I can change. To me, I dun mind changing a bit of myself to ensure that the relationship goes on strong and in a way I do agree that I have too much faults in me liao. hehe..... Dear, I would remember what you say to me and do the necessary changes. There shd be some improvements at the next date. haha.... Come to think of it, I feel that I am very fortunate to have find deardear. He's very nice and sweet to me but he's always bullying me (in a playful manner). haha....... I really want this to carry on. Dear, I dun want to make empty promises to you but time would prove my love for you. Believe in me that I would do my best to give you a better tomorrow.

      Wow, that was really early of me again to update my blog. Yesterday was quite an interesting day for me. I finally decided to talk to her.There was such a need and I am surprised that I could summon enough to walk in and request for such a talk with her.  I started off as formal and as polite as possible. I told her abt me being keen to know more things in the organisation and how I wish to further upgrade myself by being exposed to other depts. Erh.... I sound so fake that I am so disgusted myself, and before I know it, I started to tell her of the true reason why I wanted a transfer of Dept. I just told her everything abt the bitch. How she try to control my life and thinking, how she sms me 16 times in a row to get me to to have a talk with her so she can wash my brain. I am like, " Fuck off from my life, u bitch." I had enough of you. I had planned to take half day off to meet someone special but that bloody bitch just added a pile of work for me to clear. Stupid Bitch to spolit my date. Damn it. Anyway, he sms me around 4pm that he was not feeling well and he's on his way home now. Hope that he's better now and I can get to meet him up asap. I miss him.  Without a date, I worked OT again in office till 7pm, and headed for home. Got friends asking me to join them at KTV, but then I just rejected their offer. You may think that I am silly but for me, if I have a date with anyone and due to whatever reason, we can't make it, deep inside my heart, I alrdy reserved that day for him only, so I would not meet up anyone else. On the way home, happened to meet Kang Wei at Hougang Mrt Station. That's so cool cos I had not seen him for a long time. Anyway, we had a short chat at the station to catch up on lost time before I headed for home. Kang Wei was a close friend of mine that I get to know when I was in Poly. He's quite cool and he was one of the few str8 that I come out to. He had always been a great pal but he's someone that dun wish to have a hp around. I can't imagine a 25 yr old guy like him without a hp around so you can imagine how difficult it's for me to contact him and even ask him out for a cup of coffee.  Got back home and I start to worry abt him. Wonder if he's ok now. Thought of sending another sms to check on him but then he's not feeling well and he needs rest. I shd just leave him alone till today. Dun think I would want to reply to a sms anyway if I m sick. Silly me. haha......

      Dear Blog,  Do you know that I had been pouring out my soul to you? To express my feelings to you cos I dun dare to tell anyone about it. I know that there are pple reading it but then at least they never get to hear it from my mouth. haha..... I had been doing a lot of thinkings recently. I am hoping for something nice to happen and I am wishing of it everyday. Do u know that I start to dream of him at nite now and I am thinking if that's normal? I wanted to tell so much things to him but I am scared I may frighten him off. I dun want to rush into things and regret it later but then I know that he's the one for me. He's the one that I think of everyday I wake up, he's the one on my mind whenever I had my meals ( worried abt him not having his meals ), he's the one on my mind when I start to day-dream and he's the one I think of before I go to sleep cos I was hoping to meet him in my dreams. Such powerful was his image on my mind that I can't help but think of him. I wanted so much to be with him and remove all his unhappy past. I wanted to promise him a beautiful future, a better tomorrow and a sweeter life. I know that I want him to have a happy life and I am going to give it to him. I am going to make sure that no one is ever going to harm him and hurt him again.  Dear, I love you and I am willing to stand by ur side against all difficulties. Others may think that I am trying to write all these down to impress you but I still remember what I promise you. I meant whatever I written down and it's only meant for you, my dear.

      Nothing much to update abt my life but I just want to let something out from me. I had a long talk with didi today. Apparently, he had been allowed to book out yesterday nite and is suppossed to book in this afternoon and he wanted to check if I am ok. Well, I guess I am fine. I got to understand a lot of things from my didi and I must say that he could be a cool adviser sometimes.  Few Rules that I need to get in my head.  1. Dun expect too much from others. Everyone need some private space for themselves. 2. Being there for someone does not mean that you must be physically around. He may just well, want to be alone. 3. Treasure what u have and learn to accept things in life. Things dun always happen the way you want it to be.  I got to get some control over my emotions. I got to learn to take things easily. Something bad must had happened to BB. All his blogs are removed and I mean totally removed. He does not pick up my calls and I am starting to worry a bit abt him. Really hope that he's ok. Sigh.........  I am going forwards to tml cos I had a date tml. Just the thought of it makes me happy. hehe.....    Your a Unicorn! Unicorns are pure, innocent, magestic creatures that have a spiraling white horn growing out of their forehead, and a white graceful, horses body. Unicorns represent the sign of purity, innocence, freindship, healing, rejeventation, and truth. Your horn is rare prized, but you tend to be naive, lured by a childs cry. Unicorns are rare, beautiful and shy mythical creatures, and you are lucky to be one.   urlLink   What Mythical Beast are you?     brought to you by  urlLink

      For once, I dun know what to write in  my blog. Is it b'cos I am confused to what I shd write down or I am simply worried that others may read on my blog and spread rumours abt me??? Sigh........  Anyway, I meet up with someone for dinner yesterday. I was really concerned abt him cos I actually pestered that bitch and another female colleague to recommend a medicine cream for ulcers. Can't believe that I can scoop so low to them in order to get a better medicine for him. Guess he must be very impt to me loh. hehe......  After dinner at Subway, we went for a dinner. Btw, I hate Subway loh. Never like eating the food there but then I know he likes it so I force myself to eat it with him. Guess u got to make some small adjustments in life to accept love. Anyway, he got to know that I hate Subway in the end and he mentioned something like not eating it with me again. That was so sweet. Muackz... We went for a movie and were holding hands throughout the whole movie. Guess I am quite bad cos I tend to move too much in the movie and he stop holding my hands for a while. Well, I would try to improve next time by being as still as a statue. hehe.... After the movie, we went for some small shopping before we went our way home. Not wanting to part with him so soon, I requested for us to take a longer route to another mrt station. It was a long walk and he shared a lot of things with me. I started to realise that he had quite a lot of admirers and I sort of feel jealous, sad and moody. He must have sense the change in my mood cos he keeps forcing me to talk it out. So I just said that, " I dun want to lose you" He kept quiet for a while and make me repeat that again. Bad Boi. Bully me. I got to say it again to him and I blush loh cos it's so embrassing to say such things in public. I feel myself blushing again as I think back of what I did yest. nite. After that, along the way, we sort of have 2 quick kisses on the lips and I make 2 quick kisses on his cheeks as well. hehe...... I didn't get to see him home cos he feels that he's so happy now he needs to be left alone. Being the obedient one, I can only watch him board the mrt and make his way home. I miss u liao. Muackz.....  PS : I received some funny comments on the special nicks I created and I had a great time laughing over it. haha...... BK => Is it Burger King? or someone who likes to eat Burger King? haha.......... GA=> Good AJ??? haha......... GB=> Good Boi??? haha........ BB= > Boi Boi??? Bear Bear ??? haha.........

      Sigh...... So much had happened for the past few days and I really dun know how to put it down to words. I am quite confused now for what had happened. Everything seem to be happening in a super fast pace and it's just too fast for my small brain to catch up and absorb loh.  Friday  I went and meet up GA as promised. Didn't quite enjoy the chalet thingy cos it's his god bro birthday and I dun get to know anyone at all and the worst part is that I am the only stupid idiot who wear sleeveless shirt although that was meant to be the dress code. Sigh...... Hate to mention it but I think that I look damn ugly in a sleeveless shirt loh although I have yet to hear any complains from anyone. Managed to see a very loving gay couple during the chalet and they are so in love loh. Touching hands once in a while, locking their fingers. Looking deeply into each other's eyes before they reply to any questions. How I envy them? Anyway, I received a sms from GB at 9pm plus and it was a very sweet and touching sms to me. It meant a lot to me loh, but it did came as a shock cos I simply dun know how to reply to it. Guess I shd make a choice soon as to who I shd get attached to liao. Actually, I alrdy know the answer liao but I just want more time to observe. Anyway, things got worse around 1am, cos BB happen to be in a nearby chalet and he's totally drunk. He sms me, asking me to go over and take care of him. I thought for a while and I decided not to go over. Firstly, I think that I shd just treat him as a close friend and I shd not go over now cos it's a class chalet. Won't I look strange if I appear and start taking care of him? Sigh......... Secondly, when I mentioned this to GA, he looks so upset that I am going to see BB and leave him in the chalet with his kor and friends. I can't stand a sad sad face loh and the best part is I can see GA's sad face right in front of me and I only get to see BB's sms. In the end, I stay with GA in the chalet and played some card games.  Saturday  Had breakfast with GA and received a sweet morning sms from GB. I can tell that GB is very nice to me loh. hehe...... Feel so warmed by the sms. Anyway, BB also sms me in the morning, asking for a date. He just wanted to have a feeling of being out with a good date and he thinks that I would make a gd date so ok loh. Anyway, I left home early to meet GB for a while before I head down to Beach Road to help didi with his sewing of No. 4. After having lunch at beach road, rush down to Orchard to buy movie tickets to watch with BB later. When BB arrived, he complains that he's thristy and I went over to get him a drink. Along the way to watch the movie, we did some small shopping and he was happy that we shared the same thoughts on some of the issues. Managed to reach the place in time for the movie but I rush off to get him some Nacros, cos he mentioned that he loves to eat Nacros before the movie starts. When he finish eating the Nacros during the movie, I took the empty plastic holding from him and put in my lap. I opened up my bag, took out my sweater and placed it in his laps. After a while, he just put on the sweater. We did enjoyed ourselves during the movie loh. hehe... After the movie, I then told him that I brought the sweater along cos I remember him telling me once that he's afraid of the cold air-con while watching movie. I am glad that the sweater comes in handy for him loh. Guess he was touched that I remembered and he commented that I would make a great bf loh. hehe..... BK also told me on Friday that I would make a gd bf. I am really quite happy with myself loh. Went down to Nines to pass Kenner his birthday present but I didn't stay for long cos I am really very very tired.  Sunday  As usual, I need to spend didi back to camp and it was quite a normal Sunday for me but then I received a few sweet sms from GB. I dun know why but I must admit that I do have strong feelings for him. If not, we would not have try to be together in the 1st place. I know that he's attractive and I know that there are guys going after him and I just can't help feeling jealous. Sometimes, I wonder if I have the right to be even jealous in the 1st place cos he dun belong to me and we are not even attached yet, so I really treasured the sweet sms he send me. every sms he send touched my heart and send ripples over my whole body. How I wish that I can really get to hold him in my hands, look into his eyes and tell him bravely that I love him and I want to be with him forever. I just need that courage in me, to really say it out.  Quote: If I love you, and I know it. why is it that I dun dare to tell you in the face? Is it the fear of being rejected again or is it the fear that you may not be the one for me?
