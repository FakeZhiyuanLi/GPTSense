      Ahh, the dung beetle. Noble, virtuous, honourable, and tireless in its pursuit of.....poop! If only we could attain such righteous standing. They eat shit, ladies and gentlemen. Eat it, roll it, collect it, sleep in it, raise their young in it. We, on the other hand ARE shit. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't hate all people. There are and have been many great people: Mother Teresa, Leonardo DaVinci, Wayne Gretzky, Bill Nye the Science Guy, Jimi Hendrix, Martin Luther King, my mom, and many thousands less famous. But as a species, we are failing. Miserably! What creature on this planet has squandered its potential as much as humans? None. We are greedy, self-centered, territorial and violent. But most creatures are, or can be, simply as a matter of survival. The difference? We have intelligence! And we've misused it. When any other species fails, it merely fades away, becomes extinct. It's Natures way.End of story. When we fail, we cause other species and other people to falter, fail, or die out. Such is mankind's legacy. Now, the dung beetle.....There's a creature I admire. Who'd want that job? Not me, thanks. But they love it, it's what they do. I'm sure they're not even aware they've got the worst job and living conditions on Earth. But they are happy and fulfilled (I think). Simplicity. Order. Discipilne. Family values. Let's imagine we can peer into a brief moment of a family of dung beetles; Dung beetle dad: "Honey, I'm home." Dung beetle mom: "Hi, dear. How was your day?" Dad: "Long and tiring. We were rolling some impala poop, when all of a sudden, a herd of the damn things nearly trampled us !" Mom: "Oh, the irony." Dad:"Hmm. I'm famished, what's for dinner?" Mom: "Cheetah poop." Dad: "Oooh, sounds good! I'll go get Billy." ----------- Dad: "Supper's ready, son." Son: "What are we having?" Dad: "Cheetah poop." Son: "Blecchhh!! I hate Cheetah poop." Dad: "It's good for you. Besides, I brought home something special for dessert." Son: "Really!! What is it?" Dad: "Gnu poop." Son: "New poop?" Dad: "Not new poop, son. Gnu poop." Son: "Is it any good?" Dad: "I like it. It's kind of like, uhh...remember when we had that baby lion poop? Well it's kinda like that, but with more fibre." Son: "Dad, why do we always have to eat poop." Dad: "Well, we're dung beetles, son, it's what we eat." Son: "Y'know, sometimes I wish I wasn't a dung beetle." Dad: "Billy! Be proud of who you are. There are worse things you could be." Son: "Ya, sure. Like what?" Dad: "Well, you could be a human." Son: "HA-HA-HA, you're gross, dad!" Dad: "Heh-heh-heh. Let's go eat, son."
