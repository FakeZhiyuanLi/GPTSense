      This is actually my second attempt at maintaining a blog. I really dunno what happened to the first. But what some eyewitnesses tell me is that it was first washed off by a tidal wave larger than the one in "The day after tomorrow".  Hmmm...there have been wierd excuses than this actually. In fact, I was bereft of technology when I was doing my summer internship and modern civilization lost on about two months of the most sublime and supine thoughts that ever struck me. maybe, they will be lucky this time.

       Hello. Is there anybody in there?  Just nod if you can hear me. Is there anyone home?   Come on, now. I hear you’re feeling down. Well I can ease your pain, Get you on your feet again.  Relax. I need some information first. Just the basic facts: Can you show me where it hurts?   There is no pain, you are receding. A distant ship’s smoke on the horizon. You are only coming through in waves. Your lips move but I can’t hear what you’re sayin’. When I was a child I had a fever. My hands felt just like two balloons. Now I got that feeling once again. I can’t explain, you would not understand. This is not how I am. I have become comfortably numb.    “Comfortably numb” by Pink Floyd has always intrigued me. I have not seen “The wall” but it does not require a rocket scientist to figure out that the song is about death. If you are crazy about this song like I am, read on.   To understand the song, you first need to understand the Wall. The entire Wall is about a troubled life. The songs have different perspectives to different people. Pink grows up without a father, a father lost to war. In a life with no father, only hearing stories, and such, Pink turns to music. He writes lyrics, words being his only outlet of expressions. Now, he only has a mother, and his music. His mother keeps him under his wing. She is afraid of loosing him, like her husband. She helps construct a mental "wall"  Throughout his life, he decides that he won’t let anyone take take advantage of him. He falls in love with a woman and when he looses her, he decided to commit suicide. This is the part where “comfortably numb” comes on. It is how the shots are affecting his body and he is feeling numb where "you are only coming through in waves, you lips move, but I can’t hear what you are saying"  PS I wont be blogging for a week. Yeah ...you can go ahead and pop the champagne.

      WOW!  This week has sure been very busy for me. I did not have time for the customary 25 daily trips to my blog. You would notice that by the value of the counter.  I have some very good news on the placement front. My next door neighbor got a pre-placement offer from WeP peripherals. Vijay has got a great pay package from WeP (which I cannot divulge for security reasons - my own security that is). We had a huge party the same night where we were all up until 4 in the morning and stuck our tongues out at songs like “papa kehte hai” (It must have been a loser who wrote that song, nevertheless it is an awesome song), “November rain” (when it was actually July rain).   It was also great to see India win in style after quite a bit of time. Nice to see, they have not dropped the winning habit like a hot potato.I go off to Hyderabad in a couple of days and will be there for a week. There is something about the city that I just adore. A funny incident occurred when some of us were in Hyderabad a couple of years ago. We had heard so much about Hyderabadi biryani and we really wanted to dig into it. The conversation with the waiter went something like this:   Me:  Boss, khane ko kuch milega? (Not the brightest of questions considering that we were sitting in a hotel)  Waiter:  Hou (Not to be confused with its English counterpart “how”, the former usually signifies a dynamic yes disguised with indifference unless ofcourse the Hyderabadi is speaking English)   Me again:  Hyderabadi biryani milega?  (This had him floored. Even the waiter’s keen sense of judgment failed him. Looking back at it today, I have a feeling the word “Hyderabad” confused the poor soul. Maybe, that was because we were in Hyderabad!)   Waiter again:  uhh …. Hyderabadi ?? Biryani …haan Saab!  So, do they call American chopsuey just “chopsuey” in the US? Do they play just “checkers” in the land of the dragons? Or Worse, do they just watch “blues 2” in Hyderabad??

         I am currently reading "snapshots from hell" by Tim Robinson which brilliantly summarizes what B-schools are like. The book is wild and hilarious and it has me in splits whenever I compare my own predicament to his.   Flashes from my own hell (when I was in the first year at NITIE) come back to me. Now that I am in the second year, it does not make things any easier. When I find terms like "term structure of interest rates", "nelson Siegel function form" and other equally obnoxious terms being flung at poor hapless me, I cant help pitying myself. Even Omar Khatib of Fist of God would have been put to shame at a heinous activity like this - testing the endurance limits of an innocent mechanical engineer whose only fault was that he dreamt of making it big in Business!   People tend to think that having an engineering background makes us whizzes with numbers and the like. I would say this is true - normally. But then there are the people like me who are at the fag left end of the bloody normal curve. I remember every moment of confusion, horror and abject humiliation I faced in my introductory Statistics course. I was stretched to what I thought was the maximum possible physical and mental&nbsp;limit of human endurance. Now I realize how wrong I was!   Six Sigma starts from where the last course on statistics ended. It talks about things that only people like Einstein (and fourteen others who understood his bally theory) would have an idea of. Making a guy like me (with an IQ level of 45 at my brightest) take this course would amount to a crime equivalent to sending a solitary soldier into hostile enemy fire with just a Swiss-knife.   So what prevents me from jumping off my fourth floor hostel room? Apart from the fact that the hostel windows are too small for me to get through, it is the presence of subjects like Organizational behavior, Human resource management and Strategic management, where I can jargon-dump* my way through 3-page cases and still score an AB.   * This is a special kind of  maneuver  which is in vogue at all B-schools. It employs words that are  incomprehensible and verbose  in nature and these words appear in  complex sentence structures  that are created&nbsp;with an intention&nbsp;to discourage the reader. The key to this technique is  underlining jargon  and using a  near-illegible handwriting .

      This issue is more important than life and death itself…. Guess! &nbsp;You are hereby certified an Indian by yours truly if u answered “cricket”. That is what we all live and die for anyway, right?   “Tendulkar slams doubters”, “Sachin – Mr Allrounder”  were some of the headlines that appeared in the newspapers after India pulverized Bangladesh in the Asia cup. This is becoming a habit for the maestro. Let me make this clear that I am one of the greatest fans of the little master and I do not mean even an ounce of disrespect to him (I love my life, of course). But what makes me irate is, Sachin is sometimes oh-so-overrated by all of us. All it takes is a decent innings by him against even a club-level team and he is splashed all over the media. Wake up and smell the grass guys! I admit Sachin is brilliance personified and watching him is sheer delight, but why go overboard?   Sachin does not play for India because he is an entertainer (We have a full-time Sehwag for that). He is in the team because he is a match winner. Take away the two matches at Sharjah where he manhandled Australia and then bam! We have to think hard for a third game which he won for India. Contrast this to Dravid, who comes one down and we are overwhelmed by the amount of matches he has steered India to victory. This is of course in addition to the innumerable instances where he helped India avoid the ignominy of follow-on or defeat. Very few people who know the game would deny that Dravid in full flow is as classic as it can get. This reminds me of a similar debate between Beckham and Zidane. One brings in glamour and spectators and the other inspires more players into the game.  PS You can comment and add any other game that you think Sachin won for India.

      I am going to keep this short and simple. No complicated humor&nbsp;or unintended puns . This is to say  Bon Voyage  to two of my very best buds. One is starting out on a trans-Atlantic cruiser (lucky bugger!) and the “matrix” has the other.  &nbsp;   urlLink Shivali  joins Infy from the 26th of July and this would be her first venture into the IT industry. She has been a great friend for more than three years now and this is wishing her all the very best in whatever she chooses to do. What she would do in life, this I do not know but, I am sure, she would shine wherever she goes.  &nbsp;  OjaS boards one of those obscenely huge merchant ships and heads off on a voyage which will last more than 8 months. He has been a friend&nbsp;since I was so high&nbsp;and we have had some of the best times in our lives lazing away on the  katta and BH . This is hoping he earns zillionz of non-taxable dollars and remembers me -&nbsp; a friend in need who is always in need.

      It was a normal day, albeit with a difference. You see, most of my days begin at 7:35 in the morning, which gives me enough time to have a leisurely breakfast, check my mail, update myself with some blogs, perform my daily ablutions (note: no newspapers to clutter my mind )and head off to class at 9:04 – which is the latest allowed entry time. The only difference was, “today” began when GAM woke me up, at 8:40!   I remember the day when we were new in NITIE, we had an alumnus lecturing us about the big bad corporate world. He threw an innocuous looking question at us – “what is management?” After negotiating a volley of answers that were extremely obscene in terms of both practicality and management jargons, he gave his 24-carat answer – “management is decision making”  No truer words were ever spoken! For instance, I had the following decisions to make today – all in a space of less than 5 minutes.   DECISION 1:  Do I wake up at all?  PROCESS:  Uhhh....Which was this first class anyway?I am never at my brightest in the mornings.Was it PM ? O my God!!! Hell yes!    DECISION 2:   Do I take a bath?  PROCESS:   This was easy, because there was a high possibility of a quiz being held in this class and I did not want to have people shying away from me just because I stink (Don’t we all do, anyway?). My principle is simple when it comes to quizzes – the more the merrier.   DECISION 3:   Do I have my breakfast?  PROCESS:  Now, this was a very tricky decision to make, something that even Jack Welch would have been proud of. On my way down to the mess, my intuition (so vital for a manager) told me that I had about 8 minutes and 35 seconds left (Duh...I could have also looked at a watch) before this class began. And the “stairway to heaven” would take up 5 minutes. So what did I do? Quickly munch on two slices of bread with the hope that this would somehow last me until 1:40.   DECISION 4:  Do I stop writing this blog?  NO PROCESS REQUIRED:  yes  P.S. I was thinking about a way to say something about Nishant Prasad in this blog. Mission Accomplished !

      I was talking to a friend on different ways to make a blog popular. Both of us came to the conclusion that readership for a blog is extremely important and unless the “comments” column looked full and populated, the whole effort is just not worth it. An “uncommented” blog looks like MF Hussain’s Gajagamini – Lots of big stars, talent in it. It even has an esoteric story line to go with it, but unfortunately no distributors.   Then, there are also the  “one blog wonders”  which have words of invaluable wisdom on them but the author never demonstrates the same virtuosity with words and worldly wisdom again, in fact he decides that he has done enough penning for a lifetime. I wish I could write once-in-a-lifetime blogs, but I can’t. The second alternative is to keep rambling on and on and on until you don’t have any visitors left. I have clearly chosen the second alternative. So, how do the dickens you know you don’t have any visitors? (No, the blog counter does not show this, it ticks because I visit it daily ….no! make that hourly) A sure-as-litmus test is to ask one of your closest friends in hostel (If you are not in a hostel, do not despair. Try the person in the next cubicle tearing his hair out over a bug) whom you know to be an unflinching reader of your blog to “casually” look over your latest blog. If he/she gives an excuse like “But I have to go and wash my clothes now and then blow air over them to dry them. Once this is over, I will wash them again!” or “Are you aware that the next release 12.11003b is just 8 months away!! I have to work!” you know you have had it! Better go back to the more conventional methods of torturing people. By the way, did somebody say “The pen is mightier than the sword??” This blog aims to lend a whole new perspective to it.  P.S. This blog is specially dedicated to the one and only GAM of Room no 466, better known to the world (read Banjara hills) as Gaurav Paji. It is because of his tenacity and persistence with my pen-downs that my blog is what it is. Also known as Ice man and the badshah of impromptu fart, he epitomizes everything that is “strategic” in nature.   P.P.S. This blog is also dedicated to all the other people in this world as well.   P.P.P.S I never thought this blog would ever hit double figures and be a month old. But then who thought the Congress would come to power!  By the way, enjoy the budget. No, I am not going to publish my special analysis of Budget 2004.

         Harry : kya main tumhe phone kar sakta hun ? Sally : Haan , mera number directory me hai Harry : Kool !! aur tumhara naam ? Sally : wo bhi directory me hai !  Today, I have decided to start writing short stories. Why on earth the sudden urge to become another O Henry??? Yeah, I agree with you when you say that we have more Henrys than this world can afford, but then I am human and I crave for my moments of glory. Of course that was only the secondary motive behind this. I actually wanted to do my own bit for civilization.   The main and the only characters in this plot are Harry and Sally. They meet in college (like all others do) and before you can say “Harry met Sally” Harry develops this huge crush on Sally. The next “logical” thing for Harry is to try and woo Sally. Now, Harry is one of those unoriginal fellows who think that being sweet-like-honey to Sally would do the trick. To be fair to Harry, it does work in a way. Sally can now see thru Harry like a transparent bottle. (There is also the gal’s “sixth sense/intuition” thingy that a friend of mine keeps talking about .I frankly dunno much about it)   So, the picture at this point reads something like this: Harry likes Sally  Sally thinks Harry is in the “friends’ zone”  Ouch! That does not make a very pretty reading for Harry. Then the inevitable happens, Sally utters the words every guy dreads of– “Let’s be friends!”  So, Harry and Sally become friends, in fact the very best of friends.Contarary to his own expectations, Harry starts enjoying being just-friends with Sally. They start understanding each other very well. So all’s well that ends well? Not quite. Harry starts having these moments of “madness” where he crosses that threshold of friendship. He crosses the line where friendship ends and something else begins. This naturally leads to unrealistic expectations on the part of Harry and arguments ensue between Harry and Sally who otherwise look very cute as friends.   So the situation now reads: Harry starts oscillating between being just friends and being something more Sally thinks Harry is the undisputed king of the “friends’ zone”  It is still not a pretty picture for Harry. It pains him when things do not work out the way he wants them to. And also the fact that Sally means so much for him - probably more than anything else in his life troubles him to no end. But then there comes a time in every guy’s life when he must grow up and cease being that 10 year old kid when he got everything he wanted. So, it is time for Harry to realise that some things are not meant to be, and that he should let go. Also , being one of Sally's best friends also means living upto it. But does Harry know all this? Would he change for the better?   NB The author has still not decided on Harry’s fate yet. Keep watching this space for more developments between the original Harry and Sally.

      The proven way to concoct a movie so hot that, it has even the Eskimos getting out of their warm clothes.  Disclaimer: The above recipe may not be palatable to people who tend to maintain a serious disposition towards the culinary field. Some might even feel offended by the effrontery of the recipe here. The author begs pardon for this and would like to state that the above concoction has been influenced heavily by personal tastes. He accepts no moral/ethical/political responsibility for any side effects arising out of public consumption of this recipe.  Ingredients: Camcorder (Qty 1) Villains (Bush, Powell, Rice and Rumsfeld) (Qty 4) Controversy (100 ml) A fat beer-guzzling reporter standing in front of the Saudi embassy with the camcorder (Strictly 1, 2 would mean a nuclear holocaust) Gullible audience (The more the better) Media and the internet, preferably manipulated (To taste)  Take the camcorder and set off to the White house on one boring afternoon. Talk to some congressmen and ask them if they would like to enroll their children in the army in Iraq. Mix the four villains with 100 ml of controversy and heat them over a flame until they turn brownish red. “Stir the pot” well until you smell something burning. Remove the pot from the oven and lay the misture on a newspaper-covered plate in the red hot condition. Garnish with some great “sneak peeks” in the form of movie trailers on all forms of media. Serve Hot (do I need to mention that?) on a platter to the gullible audience and hope that the audience likes the dish and “munches” on the crunchy villains.

      It is 1:56 in the night or the morning for the more human people reading this. I am on a high. No, I did not drink. The ambience got to me. Dancing for two hours on the trot does take its toll I guess.   I am no prude when it comes to what I believe people should do or not do. But I do believe in a code of morality that we as humans ought to follow. Does our life have a purpose? Are we bound by some mysterious string which holds us from crossing “that” line? Or are we just an improved form of animals (with the added ability to think rationally) and we have just four objectives in life (sleeping, eating, excretion and mating)?  When I hear/see people puking to glory after drinking too much, girls dancing the way they should not (the word “should” is again a very subjective term and it should not construed as chauvinism on my part, I just happen to believe that girls for what they are deserve more respect than guys), people carried away in a delirious state, girls going to guys’ rooms, and many more things that I am thankfully not an audience of, it gets me thinking. Is succumbing to carnal pleasures right? If yes, are we different than animals? If succumbing to materialistic desires is wrong, is it completely wrong or are we at a liberty to indulge occasionally? I mean, there must be some line where recreation ends and animal materialism begins. Is the objective of life to enjoy it to the hilt letting no other obstacle come in the way? Or listening to that tiny little voice inside us that sometimes squeaks to pass its judgment on what we do?  So what then is the objective of our life? I am a part of a class of 86 management students who have fires in their bellies and great plans for the way they are going to live life. Almost all of these plans (including mine) revolve around money, power, position and married life. Should the sphere of human thought be expanded to include something else too? If the answer is yes, pray tell me what something else is …….  The objective of life surely has to be more than: Born: 4th Sep 1981  Died: 24th Dec 2041

       This Blog contains material which might be objectional to certain audiences. The author recommends descretion on the part of the reader.He does not accept responsibility for any mental side-effects that may occur after reading it    I absolutely abhor quizzes !A Quiz is the worst and the bluntest of all methods to prove that your mind is sluggish, you can't think fast, you can't think right ...and so on. Just how many times do we guys think about women and bathing models and when a question about "Leela Chitnis was the first what??" is asked, it just does not come back !!!! Same goes with sex. They say 99% of a guy's thoughts are about sex or related activities and the rest is about beer. SO why the hell does our memory fail us with "Viagra"??? It should have been a reflex action - When someone says Pfizer , you think Viagra .....  But jokes apart , we had a ball. It is amazing how quizzing can give u the goosebumps and all that. Especially when you are able to crack something like this and you dont do this everyday:    Connect

      It all started in our strategic management class. In one of those discussions where just about everyone is trying to emulate Porter, we come on to a discussion on "who is a stakeholder in a company??"  I would be lying if i said that it did not start all right. Conventional answers like "owners","employees" and "shareholders" started pouring in. This is when yours truly decided to lend his brilliant creative streak to the above discussion by saying that "society at large" is a stakeholder. It must have been the late night or the missed breakfast (coz i dont drink), but the bottom line here is I actually said that. To top it , I also substantiated my answer with an example.  Now, all hell broke loose. The definition was quickly amended to include all those directly or indirectly affected by the company's performance as stakeholders. This was actually all right until the discussion took a nasty turn when one bright fella said that Standard fireworks has a stake in all companies coz if they dont do well , nobody gets a Diwali bonus and their crackers wont sell.  Somebody even dragged the poor leapord that has been stalking in and around NITIE all this time into the picture. I dont really remember how the poor cat got into this , but all I can do is take pity on it and hope that it never ever decides to eavesdrop again...For its own good ofcourse !  Somebody mentioned something about multicollinearity ....Well , that was the last we heard of that guy as the Prof decided to take things into her hands......   "Dil pe mat le ....Haath me le!"

      The sky was blue without a cloud, the grass green and seven members on either side....idyllic setting for a game of Futbol! ( I would like to interrupt here to mention that I am not a Pele or a Maradona ....in fact I am not even a novice when it comes to Futbol ....what do u call somebody who has played barely 4 hrs of football prior to this ??)  The match started off in real earnest. And then I started to weave my magic. I ran like the wind , dribbled like Figo , and drove like rooney. Hmmmm...I don’t know how much of all that really took place...But hey!! This is pure passion ... I just don’t know where reality ended and where the dream began!  SO, I ran like the wind for 25 minutes ....making a few intelligent passes .... But my team members were not as intelligent as I was and they were never in the places I passed to . I even made this Beckham-like-cross But alas! there was no Owen to tuck it into the goal ......  I really don’t understand why people have to be a specialist defender or a midfielder. I mean, look at me ! I am a natural at any place on the field. The opponents soon realized my dexterity with the ball and my speed and they had me marked well ....Maybe that was the reason my team mates were not giving me the ball ....So I ran like the wind for another 25 minutes. You might think that I was not playing an active role by just running around …..But then how many people here have heard of mind games in football …..??  The whistel blew ......Needless to say ….we had lost 2-3 ….

      This is a little lengthy but very inspirational....   God: Hello. Did you call me?   Me: Called you? No, who is this?   God: This is GOD. I heard your prayers. So I thought I will chat.   Me: I do pray. Just makes me feel good. I am actually busy now. I am in the midst of something.   God: What are you busy at? Ants are busy too.   Me: Don't know. But I can't find free time. Life has become hectic. It's rush hour all the time.   God: Sure. Activity gets you busy. But productivity gets you results. Activity consumes time. Productivity frees it.   Me: I understand. But I still can't figure out. By the way, I was not expecting YOU to buzz me on instant messaging chat.   God: Well I wanted to resolve your fight for time, by giving you some clarity. In this net era, I wanted to reach you through the medium you are comfortable with.   Me: Tell me, why has life become complicated now?   God: Stop analyzing life. Just live it. Analysis is what makes it complicated.   Me: Why are we then constantly unhappy?   God: Your today is the tomorrow that you worried about yesterday. You are worrying because you are analyzing. Worrying has become your habit. That's why you are not happy.   Me: But how can we not worry when there is so much uncertainty?   God: Uncertainty is inevitable, but worrying is optional.   Me: But then, there is so much pain due to uncertainty.   God: Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional.   Me: If suffering is optional, why do good people always suffer?   God: Diamond cannot be polished without friction. Gold cannot be purified without fire. Good people go through trials, but don't suffer. With that experience their life becomes better not bitter.   Me: You mean to say such experience is useful?   God: Yes. In every term, Experience is a hard teacher. She gives the test first and the lessons afterwards.   Me: But still, why should we go through such tests? Why can't we be free from problems?   God: Problems are Purposeful Roadblocks Offering Beneficial Lessons to Enhance Mental Strength. Inner strength comes from struggle and endurance, not when you are free from problems.   Me: Frankly in the midst of so many problems, we don't know where we are heading.   God: If you look outside you will not know where you are heading. Look inside. Looking outside, you dream. Looking inside, you awaken. Eyes provide sight. Heart provides insight.   Me: Sometimes not succeeding fast seems to hurt more than moving in the right direction. What should I do?   God: Success is a measure as decided by others. Satisfaction is a measure as decided by you. Knowing the road ahead is more satisfying than knowing you rode ahead. You work with the compass. Let others work with the clock.   Me: In tough times, how do you stay motivated?   God: Always look at how far you have come rather than how far you have to go. Always count your blessing, not what you are missing.   Me: What surprises you about people?   God: When they suffer they ask, "Why me?" When they prosper, they never ask "Why me". Everyone wishes to have truth on their side, but few want to be on the side of the truth.   Me: Sometimes I ask, who am I, why am I here. I can't get the answer.   God: Seek not to find who you are, but to determine who you want to be. Stop looking for a purpose as to why you are here. Create it. Life is not a process of discovery but a process of creation.   Me: How can I get the best out of life?   God: Face your past without regret. Handle your present with confidence. Prepare for the future without fear.   Me: One last question. Sometimes I feel my prayers are not answered.   God: There are no unanswered prayers. At times the answer is NO.   Me: Thank you for this wonderful chat. I am so happy to start the day with a new sense of inspiration.   God: Well, Keep the faith and drop the fear. Don't believe your doubts and doubt your beliefs. Life is a mystery to solve not a problem to resolve. Trust me. Life is wonderful if you know how to live. Best wishes for a good day!

      SO what was I doing all this while ? I frankly dunno . Blame my blognactivity partly on nothing interesting happening in my life and partly on me losing my creative streak ....(huh ...what ??)  Something new ...Gave my final summer project presentation in the college at last. It was actually a good experience and it was good to hear some intelligent questions at last ;) I mean when you have given a 2 hour presentation at your company out of which you spend half an hour on explaining why the normal curve is bell shaped ....you do tend to appreciate questions which r even remotely relevant to your project !  Back to my hostel room , which effectively means cacophonic hell for my neighbours. I have "graduated" in my metal music tastes (thou not yet to satanic levels like "cradle of filth") ....Am bordering somewhere in the doom-speed metal line ....    many people ask why the hell do they call all that noise "music" .... Petrucci of DT would retort " I play my guitar fast bcoz ....I can !!"   PS ...My respect for Schmie has immensely increased after the British GP .....

      I was reading  urlLink Shubham's blog  on nostalgia and I could not agree more with him. As I look back on my 'golden years' spent in school and college, one thing stands out above all else - the list of my crushes.Hmmm... I hear you saying "OK Ganesh, just because we read your blog doesn't mean we don't have anything better to do". Well, if that is the case, for your own good, I would advise you to leave. But, if you have nothing else to do and are depressed, this might make you feel better. You would know you are not the only love-struck guy around (pun intended).  So, are you still with me?   I was an early starter who acted on instincts. My first crush was in the fifth standard. I don't remember much of her except that she had hazel eyes and her name was Ashwini. Of course, she left school when we joined the sixth standard. This would, as you would notice, be a standard ending to most of my crushes. So Ashwini, if you are reading this and you are already not married, it is never too late. Err... I dont think I remember your last name.  The next lasted for about two years in high school. Even at my charming best, I was not the young and enthusiastic teenager who would strike up a lovely conversation with a girl. Stuttering, stammering and staring were some of my more preferred maneuvers.I quickly became the undisputed king of the friends' zone, something that "terrifies, petrifies and mortifies" all guys. Mine was the shoulder they needed when their boyfriends ignored them, when they didn't score well in exams or when they had a tiff with their best friends. This crush wanted me to "remain friends" even after we left school. I did what the best and the most unrelenting of guys would do in trying situations like this - remain friends.  Junior college was a drag - one of those situations where you know you are in college but how well you do in life depends on those crucial two years. So I made a great attempt to be a studios and a sincere student. This had the only effect it could have. I had a 12-feet magnetic force field effect on girls around me - the kind of magnetism in which they don't enter the field.(Now that I look back at it, I realize, not studying in those two crucial years would not have mattered a great deal after all)  Enter engineering college and times changed drastically. Fate put me into one of those unfortunate cliques. Yes, I had chosen mechanical engineering and fate had had the last snickering laugh. Yet, I managed my longest crush during this time. I was one of those determined individuals, who was not ready to let fate screw up his life. I decided to do it with my own hands and I did a damn neat job of it!   The Road ahead  I have given up on crushes now. But, if you are female and think that I am cute (I purposefully don't have a picture here, so don't scroll up to see my profile) and have not dumped me in the recent past, I might reconsider my decision.

      One of my recent mails to my friends working in IT companies in Pune:  are you guys allright ? shan replied yesterday ... ani and sau ....r u  guys still online ? just reply with a blank email so tht i know u r still alive   Ganesh   One of the guys replied:     --- Ganesh Iyer   wrote:    > are you guys working allright ? > shan replied yesterday ... > ani and sau ....r u  guys still online ? > just reply with a blank email so tht i know u r still alive   Yeah, He actually sent me a blank mail. I had no option but to reply in an equally fitting manner. I promptly sent him a mail which contained a single word.   Mazurdya    There were days when I used to meet one of my "IT" friends online and then he/she would chat like there was no tomorrow. They would ask me how I was, they would ask me how my parents were, they would ask me how our mutual friends were, they would ask me whether I thought the Sensex was going up .Heck ! They would even ask me how Tiger was. (The funny thing is I don't even have a dog called Tiger)  Now, what i get when I meet someone online is:   Me:   u there?   Him :  yes  Me:   What are you doing?   Him:   Duhh...like work dude...   (I actually used to get answers that were different from this and ranged from playing minesweeper to playing NFS 2 on the network)  Me:   So u r busy ?   Him:  (no reply)  Me:   well, Cya later   Him:  (no reply)  The message from the other side of the line is pretty clear.  "I don't have no time for jobless people like you. I actually work."   I used to think I could get into one of those companies where I can live the good life. But , it now appears that I would actually have to *work* for a living too. Gosh ! how much would that suck after being a student all my life !

      Why ?  1. I got up late for the first class and am too early for the second.  2. I had my breakfast and I am blogging the first thing in the morning. I am just hoping that the Prof does not decide to conduct a surprise quiz today.  3. I am doing all of this with my email client

       “How are you doing, Ma’am?”    “I am fine, thank you very much”   The question was addressed to the nice lady sitting opposite to me at Pizza hut. It had a touch of reverence and genuine concern to it. The guy waiting on us then turned to me and asked “And what will you have, sir?”. He had a look that was cold and arrogant. He spoke to me as if I was a fugitive from Somalia.  His demeanor would have caused even the most conservative English butler to clap his hands and legs furiously and dance with heartfelt approval (Raising their left eyebrow a sixth of an inch is the farthest they go, I am told).   “And would you like some Garlic bread to start off?”   The question wasn’t even addressed to me. However, I butted in with a meek “yes”. But the nice lady was not in a mood to have bread and my petition was overruled without a second thought. It just did not matter.   “And Pepsi, Ma’am?”  “No”   So, I had pizza without Pepsi,Garlic bread and mustard sauce. And I paid 300 bucks for all of the above. When we left, the nice lady sounded the bell kept at the door which signalled that the customer was happy with the service.   “Thank you Ma’am!!”  shouted the guy.  I felt like sounding the damn gong until it never made a sound again.  P.S. I had a very nice time that evening  P.P.S. Really

      1.Aim to provide  quality content . A blog on what you thought of the non-superhuman treatment of spiderman 2 where you get into the psych of Peter Parker is cool. Writing about "mujhse shaadi karogi" is well ..... Err.... Suicidal.  2. Blog regularly . I cannot emphasize enough on this. A live testimonial would be this blog itself. I generally use a 48 hour alarm clock and I start typing whatever is on my mind when it goes off. The timing can be varied according to personal preferences and the current level of joblessness.  3.Define the  type of readers  and the content you want for them. It is essential to understand here that not many zombies (if any) read your blogs, so as a general rule, writing about the nuances of death is not advisable.  4.This is a tricky one. Try using  keywords  that attract major search engines like google and AltaVista. Subtlety is the key here. Eg.  Sachin Tendulkar  of  India  plays  cricket . He likes  music  and  free Mp3 . His favorite  teen celebrities  are  Sharapova  and  Britney Spears .  Sex : male. He hates  Pamela Anderson .  5. Get involved in other blogs  in a big way. Always leave thoughtful comments like "visit my blog at http://iyerganesh.blogspot.com"  6.Mention your blog wherever you can - email signatures, comments on other blogs, websites, friends' diaries, caps, shirts, trousers, bikes, cars, and the big hoardings on the buses etc. The key here is to be imaginative.   Disclaimer:  The above are time tested methods which would bring the best and the most relevant readers to your blogs. The very fact that you are here reflects the efficacy of these methods. Why did I call this a disclaimer? It kinda looks cool. That is the seventh tip.  Finish in a manner that leaves the readers numb with excitement.

      I finally made it to Hyderabad. Unfortunately, I don't have pics to share of the trip for the  nisarg premis  amongst you. Not that we did not do anything worth capturing on the lens. Listed below are some of the finer moments of the trip.   - Saw  "with me marriage will you do?" . It must have been the stars or maybe the biryani at Hyderabad house, but the fact remains that I made a voluntary decision to go watch "mujhse shaadi karogi". Yeah, the Gestapo would have been better. By the end of the movie, I had a splitting headache and IMHO  Sallu bhai  in the movie was in a much better situation than I was. Atleast he did not have to see himself with a fake balloon on top of his head hamming away to Bollywood glory and Akkie doing the cool-guy stuff. The saving grace was the special appearance of some Indian cricketers in the end and the discovery that the bhelpuri of a movie was after all not original. Just a poor copy of Anger management with the prerequisite oomphs and sentiness which is so vital for Hindi films. Did I mention that David Dhawan was the Misdirector?  - Went to Begumpet and Hitech areas where there are like a thousand software firms around.I Was especially impressed by the colossal structures at Hitech city. Me and my friend were disappointed when we noted the decreasing aesthetic "quality" of receptionists at software firms. After a lot of deliberation and analysis on this , we blamed the BPOs and the callcenters for attracting the real "talent" out there with great paychecks rendering the S/W firms desolate.  - Saw Spidey 2. Enough has been said and done about this already. But personally, I liked the "human" side of spiderman. The script lacked conviction but the Special FX were great as usual. It had me wondering - how many times would MJ allow Peter Parker to go off with a "Go get 'em tiger!" while they are in the middle of a kiss?? Once or twice during the movie is okay I mean ... :D    Public notice:  There is a certain Mr. Hrishikesh Diwan who was kind enough to dedicate his entire blog to me. He was also kind enough to send me the link. What was not so kind of me is that I managed to lose it.(Dedications dont happen everyday. Was a bit over-excited i guess). So Hrish, if you are reading this, just add a comment to this blog and I will add your link to the sidebar. I get like a thousand hits everyday (I reset the counter daily to prevent it from blowing off) and more the blogging junta the merrier it gets !
