      The biggest difference between maracas and babies is DON'T SHAKE BABIES!   Perhaps a bigger difference is that 70s Spanish sensation Charo doesn't employ babies in her act.

      Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man how to fish and who knows when he'll eat.

      Did everyone notice that blogger.com publishes entries with the Anglophilic lower case 'l'?  I guess that's what makes it my favourite weblog.

      Those who are the least concerned with the harsh penalties for littering are those who've just torn up a contract.

      I just had a corn removed from my foot, and I'm told that if I continue to put Heel Balm on it every morning and occasionally scrape it out with some kind of drill attachment from a hardware store (this was recommended by the nurse), I will not have to go to the doctor often to get it shaved off.

      One thing that really puts things in perspective is that babies born fifty years from now won't be 20 until the year 2074.

      Some people think it's impossible to train fleas, but I figured out how. First, you will need to train a dog.

      I could use a quick cash influx, so if anyone has a nice, clean (white!), baby lying around please send my way. I plan on training it to make fashion accessories with ironic designs that hipsters will purchase from me. I believe this is how Paul Frank got started. Please help me to achieve my goals.

      But if any of you know somebody who wants to have one with me, please send her my way.

      I have kids. They're not babies anymore, however, in a Christmas newsletter sent out after we pumped out the last one (Which ran under the headline "Beautiful Birth Marred By Hideous Afterbirth," which the Onion also used as a skybox) we published a list of helpful tips on raising babies. I can't recall the entire list, but I'll attempt to recreate portions of it here. Feel free to add:  Helpful Hints for a Healthy Baby  Experts recommend early discipline, but be sure to take it slowly. Use unlit cigarettes until you get the hang of it.  Teething? Grandma was right to recommend brandy. Immerse infant repeatedly in Korbel.  Remember to use diaper wipes with a grade no lower than 60 grit.  If baby cries for extend stretches, the quickest resolution is to turn off the monitor.  ...you get the idea.
