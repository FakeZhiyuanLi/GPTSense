           ending up doing absolutely nothing does not exactly make me interesting now does it. i decided that tomorrow i will make a change and i will be on the prowl to find myself a job. not just any job though, no, it will be a grocery bagger, or a server at a fast food joint. you know those high paying, minimum wage, manual labor, type jobs. how excited am i then, to only be able to work when they are in need of some extra help. not when i want to work, but on their time, oh yes. its not that its not to be expected, because of course this will be my first, actual job. im just not excited about it. well thats tomorrows expectation, even though i still havent got to the whole cleaning up the room idea. oh well.          ...sometimes i wish that i could fly. i could make this happen of course, hop on an airplane, but thats not the same as making yourself fly without help of high powered engine beneath my feet. i could just sniff a can of paint which would make me feel as though im floating, but thats still not the entire experience either. ive always told myself that when im older, im going to go skydiving and then try base-jumping. an ultimate adventure lies in both of these, but still not the whole of flying. hangliding is about the closest anyone has come to flying. being able to totally be in control of where one is going while taking flight, without use of motor, is still impossible. finding a job tomorrow is kind of a metaphor of taking flight, i will be going somewhere that i have never been, but it still sucks.

        as of now i am here. among u now, is not the extrodinary, but the ordinary girl named petey. i wasnt always this, however. my rents orginally yelled at alicia, this was all drastically changed when this girl entered grade six. at this age my peers began to use this "petey" as some sort of nickname, understandably, for my last name happens to be petersson. it was either or it happened to be ironic. many of my life happenings are ironic though, but that doesn't leave me of a conclusion. why do nicknames exist anyway? why would some odd rent name their kin robert, but not ever once say this. instead they use bob or bobby as a substitute. this seems ironic to me, but then again i may be ironic in any sense depending on whom may be reading this most dull post.           now that i have got past the ironicies(if thats even a word for i am unaware) of the whole nickname thing. maybe u should be aware of my ampt for life(not). living in a town where the only thing to do is smoke weed and have sex makes me very bored. there is nothing at all in this deselent place. if only i lived in a cave up in the Andes mountains and be secluded by the miles of jungle seperating me from any near civilization, then i could find harmony with this lifeless life that i just so happening to be living. isnt that the way the average american teenage girl feels though? thats what i thought.
