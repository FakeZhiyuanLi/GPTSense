       Hey Cho! Young! I just got my big Clark packet... The Opening of school information one. And I was looking through the Parent and Student Handbook for 2004-2005. In the faculty list, Mimoto-sensei's name IS listed. I don't know why the alpha room list indicated it as "Mata." Perhaps it is a misprint? Typo? Or even a student teacher? Maybe Mimoto will miss the first day of school. I don't know. But for one thing, the faculty list seems up to date... Unless Mimoto-sensei decided to quit "last minute." =T Mr. Z Is not listed. And neither is Mrs. Myers. Huh, too bad Mrs. Thompson is still at Clark. There's also another Thompson listed under science. Hmmm. I hope that Mimoto is still around. I don't want to have to get used to another Japanese teacher. >__  Okay. Later then. =P School's approaching near! >__

       Yes you spoiled person, ahem, Kevin, who not only has wood flooring but has a maid. LOL. Just messing. =P  You know what I think? I think you should donate those couple thousand dollars to Tiffany so she could put that money into great use -- that is, her college tuition and expenses. =D Yea yea? Okay.  I don't know. I think your Honda civic is perfectly fine. Just fix that weird buzzing sound from the back and work on your stick driving! .__. The GTI looks like a crossover between a passenger car and a mini van. o_O I guess that's what a Wolkswagen is supposed to look like? LoL. I don't know. I'm not a car expert like you. Har har. You could wait another year or two until you get a good deal. Car prices goes down right? Well, for older models that is.  We all have something we want. We are already provided with all we need. I guess we should just be content with what we have. Patience pays! Maybe you'll find another stellar car than the GTI. There are new models every year. Save up, and go from there.  But I still think you should be generous and offer me some financial aid for my upcoming college expenses. =D College application fees. Yup yup.  Later peopleeeee.

       Whoa I haven't posted for a long time, and I'm getting lazy with my own journal. Time to get on track!  As most of you know, I've been thinking of buying a car lately, namely a  urlLink black Volkswagen GTI 1.8T . Why? The car's fast? It's sexy? It's roomier? Honestly I really don't have a good reason. I already have a car that's only 2 years old that runs perfectly fine. It gets me from point A to point B perfectly fine.  Maybe I'm just a spoiled kid who isn't satisfied with what I have. I look around at my other friends who still have to take the CAT bus everywhere and here I am wanting to spend $10,000 on something that I really don't need. When I first bought my Civic I told myself I was going to keep it for a good 10 years. Here we are two years later...   I talked to my neighbor about it and he said that if I really want it I should go for it, but that's the  philosophy of most worldly people today anyways. Hmm...I guess I should just pray about it and see what happens. If i get a extremely great irresistible deal I'll probably just go for it. In any case, Jesus is my great reward...in him I am always satisfied =)

         DAILY VERSE   What is impossible from a human perspective is possible with God.   -Luke 18:27 / (NLT)     DEVOTIONAL   Without seeing things the way God does, we can lose hope and get discouraged. Ask God to help you see your situation from his perspective. Things may seem more manageable. And don't forget to thank him for the opportunity to get a bird's-eye view!

       Hey guys~  I'm bored. I don't really have much to share. Hmm. I'm in a mood to listen to music. I need new music! You guys know any bands? Songs? Preferably Christian bands. (No Jay Chow for me... Hahah Leighton.) I know Kevin listens to a lot of those hardcore Christian rock music. Har har. I'm getting hooked on to that type of music too. o_O Gee, thanks Kevin.  Kazaa sucks nowadays. Is it just me, or you can't seem to download a lot of files anymore? Soulseek is retarded too. >__ =o ...Still in search of an IRC music channel. =P   Well, later everyone.

       I'm hungry.  Anyone want to take me out to Sweet Tomatoes for some scrumptious salad/soup/pasta buffet?! Hahaha.  Well, it's still somewhat early in the morning. I enjoy the time before dawn, in the wee morning hours (say, around 4 or 5 am). It's so quiet around me and I feel at peace. =P It's a relaxing time for me to lay around the bed or the floor and just let my thoughts wander. Sometimes I talk to myself, but at the same time, it seems like I am conversing with God. And I do believe God is listening to me. Whenever I am troubled, He calms me down. Whenever I talk about a problem, God helps me to solve it. It's just a wonderful time. =P  One of my peaceful morning moments was Sunday morning of the summer retreat. It was when everyone slept in until 9. Hahaha. But I woke up around 5:30 (yup! xP) and went up to the lounge area. The place is slightly lit, and the sun is about to rise. I don't quite know how to describe the feeling, but it's just so tranquil. xP The windows open to a view of the trees and mountains. Very lovely. Anyway, I just laid on the sofa and relaxed. I conversed with God, and kind of dozed off here and there. When the sky became brighter, I got my Bible and sat in the kitchen table for Q.T. It's a warm spot. The sunlight shone through the windows. I like. =P  Yea, just another quick share. Too bad the retreat went by pretty fast. I liked the days up in the mountains... Get away from the city. The air is much clean and crisp! I can tell that I can connect with God better up in the mountains than back at home. So, we must have another outting. I just hope I won't have anything conflicting! >__  When do you guys feel connected with God? Just a share. Well, happy reading. Until next time!

       We were supposed to be with the adult congregation at church today since James is still in Texas but me and Leighton decided to hang out with those crazy Sunday School Kids. After sitting for about 15 minutes watching some cartoons, Regis pops up and so we all decided to sit outside. Then after about another 15 minutes we see Jean! All these people late to church, geez..hehe.  So there we were sitting together in a small circle just talking about whatever (thanks to Jean, we know all the little dirty secrets about Shan, hahahaha!).  Looking back, the funny thing to me is how different the group of us that was sitting there were. Jean's 29, a school teacher and is married. Regis is 19 and is married to Jing, lol.  Leighton is 16  and is married to Miss Korea. And I'm 21, a senior in college, and a part-time banker.  If it weren't for me being in church, I don't think I would've ever known (much less been friends) with any of those people I was sitting with yesterday morning.  But because of His love, God has chosen us to worship him together and to be a church. God has put people in my life that I can talk to and see advice from. All praise and glory goes to God.

       Well, I came upon Leighton's Xanga a few mintues ago. He posted all the Miss Universe pageant contestants there. LoL. They all represent the Asian countries. Go figure. What's so great about only Asians anyway? I think there are much prettier women of other races than just the Asian ones. Leighton and his crave over Korean girls. LoL. But Leighton, there ARE pageant winners who are Asians from previous years. Miss India won for 2000. Oh, and Miss Japan won back in 1959. LoL. And there are also Asians who became runner ups. I mean, Miss Universe is more than just the looks, which Leighton always considers first (yes, very true). =P It must be difficult for the judges to eliminate and choose from over 80 beautiful women!   I don't know. Is that how all guys are? LoL. Picking and choosing people of a certain race? I am usually the only girl hanging out with the church guys, and it's rather interesting listening to the guys' coversations about Asian girls -- especially among Leighton and David (haha). Then again, we all have our own tastes of the opposite gender. Leighton goes for Boa, I go for anime guys. LoL. =P  But as I have said before, Jesus surpasses all others! Woo! =P

       Boy, Team U.S.A. in basketball played terrible! We lost to Puerto Rico. Sad sad. And all the players can't shoot the ball. Seriously! Anyway... I'm looking forward to the swimming event with Phelps, Thorpe, and I think Van Den Hoogenband (what an interesting last name, haha). I wonder who will win. o_O  Well, China is in the lead currently with the most medals (10 total, 6 golds). Then Australia (9 total, 5 golds), and U.S.A. third (8 total, 1 gold). One gold? Geez. Only thanks to Phelps. As for South Korea... They're down there somewhere. =P 2 medals, both bronze. Hee hee.  I want some rain here. That would be nice!

And Just thank him so much, because I remember my church youth group praising without heart, and now, we're jumping all over the place for him :-D. However, I still know that we can praise better! So please pray that we praise with our heart and truth :-D. I go pee now :-D lol Thank you all :-D

       Yea, Hurricane Charley and its aftermath have been on the news recently. I was watching the news eariler, and the news reporters interviewed/featured a few people who witnessed and experienced the hurricane action. I'm sure it must have been devastating and difficult to cope with in losing their house. I'm sure I would be. >__  Aside from that, I also saw on the news that help is on the way. The community is looking after one another... There is relief and help. A man volunteered to supply water to families without shelter. And shelters are offered and being built for those who are now homeless. Just like after the September 11 attacks, everyone grew close and became helpful. Whenever I hear of some sort of disaster or destruction like that, I also hear of preservation and encouragement, along with charity and compassion.  Perhaps, God allows such diasters to happen because it grabs our attention, and we turn to God for comfort and refuge. Especially after 9/11, the nation looked up to God for strength and comfort to cope with loss. And God provides for us when we turn to Him. So, whenever we face disasters or sufferings, lean on God. He will take care of you always. Sometimes you might find yourself in a cycle -- I know I do. >__  Let us keep those who experienced loss and sufferings from the hurricane in prayer. It's something we could do, and God will provide the rest. =P

       One more quick post! I'm watching the Olympics right now. They are having the men's diving event. I think it's the double ones? I don't know. But they dive in pairs. Boy, they dive at the exact same rate! They do the flips and neat stuff at the same rate... And also land in the pool at the same rate! Goodness. It's a wow. =P Wow wow wow. LoL.  Oh... And the Chinese currently has the lead in the duo/pair diving event. LOL. They would probably end up taking the gold. Who knows. =P And U.S.A. takes the last place currently. o_O Hmm.   (Few mintues later...)  Okay, China took home the gold. LoL. Then Great Britain. Then Australia. U.S.A. is last. Sad. Well, I'm looking forward to the gymnastics events this week. =P

       Just a quick post. I was looking through Young's Xanga for a bit. I saw his cool ABREADCRUMB and FISH shirt. ;D Coolness! Interesting, I see the words "GOT FAT" all over Young's entries. LoL. Young, you work out and such even though you say you eat a lot. I don't think your fat. =P  Anywayyy. I liked Young's tee shirt idea. I don't know what he said when I talked to him previously, but I'll figure that out later. Maybe we can customize a few nifty shirts of our own. xP   Next time!  Oh by the way, how much were your shirts Young? Cho?

       Am I the only one extremely confused by Leighton's post? Don't worry Leighton, you're still my buddy! hahahahaha!  Anyways, I just wanted to share with everyone a verse that I probably read at least once every other week, not because I make some special effort to read it but because for some strange reason, I always feel God pulling me back to those few verses. The passage I'm talking about is Psalm 51. The one where David is on his knees with a broken heart confessing himself to God. It'd take me too long to go over what the whole passage means to me so I'll just pick out one verse in particular.  Towards the end of his prayer in Psalms, David says in verse 17 "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart. O God, you will not despise." What does this mean? It means that what God really wants from me isn't first and foremost money, time, kindness, friendliness or even serving the church. It's a broken heart. Why would God want that from his people? Because in order to have a  proper  relationship with Him, we first have to realize how much we  need  Him. When we realize that we are sinful people, that we are evil by nature, that we wrong not only others, but ourselves as well as God who created us...that is when we seek God Almighty and rely on him instead of ourselves.  So many times, God has reminded me how sinful I am just as he did with King David. During those times, I am overwhelmed with sadness and regret and pray to God for forgiveness. Yet after a season of mourning comes peace and joy. I am filled with the wonderful knowledge that even though I am a sinner, I can stand before God because Christ died for me. It is then that I feel closest to God, that the concepts of "grace" and "forgiveness" are most clear.  Thus, only when we meet the requirements of having a broken and contrite heart will God accept our measly burnt offerings of "righteousness" and "make Zion prosper", simply because it is at moments like that when we are closest to God's loving arms.

Let's share!  Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!     Geez.. I want to go back to school now... I have a sudden urged to freak dance, and my groovy moves must be satisfied!

He watches his apples grow, tenderly prunes the tree, and, at the perfect moment, he picks the fruit--ripe and ready to be enjoyed.

       Hello people. I am back from my two-day trip. o_o Not that that really matters. Anyway, at least God guided my family and me back to Vegas safely. =D We had 12 people in the car!  Well, it's almost midnight, and tonight is the peak for the Perseid meteor shower. I think some of you guys are looking out for it. =D Just a quick share... I've always been fascinated by the night sky and space since I was in elementary school. (I have lots of astronomy books by the way! =D). Since I came to be a Christian, my interest in the night sky became an even better experience. You come to notice God's mighty and lovely creations. It's just... awesome. It's not just the stars and meteors, but if you ever come across pictures of different galaxies, aurorae, and other colourful space objects, you would be amazed of how everything looks. It's rather nifty in my opinion. To me, I draw closer to God by recognizing his majestic works in space. Also, space is just so mysterious! And well, God too is mysterious, but overall beautiful.  The best times to view are from 2 am to near dawn! =D Light pollution sucks - especially in Vegas. Try to find a nice dark and comfortable place and enjoy yourself! And of course, spend a few moments with God, and give Him credit for His awesome handiwork. =D

       I just want to begin my first post by saying just how blessed I am to have this undeserved relationship with Jesus Christ. Everyday he's by my side, everyday he forgives my sins; there's no greater reward than the loving arms of the Savior who died for me. Praise God!  One of the main ways that Jesus  surrounds  me with his presence and love is through all my brothers and sisters in the church. But it wasn't always like this. When I first started going to church, I didn't have any church friends, and the church was hardly a family for me. I would feel disconnected from everybody. After services when the youth group would hang out and fellowship, I would walk away from them and sit by myself. It wasn't that the youth group wasn't welcoming, I just felt incapable of bonding with them. Even when I did try to make a conversation with somebody, the only words I could muster up was "yeah" or "nah". As you can imagine, the "conversation" didn't go too far. I felt utterly pathetic. This lasted for about 5 or 6 years, believe it or not.  Then one day up at a retreat, God chose to come down and touch my heart and set me free from all my weaknesses and sins. Today, God has blessed me with so many friends in the church that it just breaks my heart knowing that God is giving me something that I longed for for years and yet is something that I totally don't deserve. But I accept God's grace with gratitude, with praise, and with a desire to shine back his love.  You guys all know who you are, those of you that express the love of God through your friendship with me. Words could never express what God has done through all of you to touch my life.   Hallelujah  .

           I love today's devotional and verse! I won't lie; everyone goes through crap. Some go through stuff you'll never imagine, but always remember! Trials are good and strengthen us and our character! So next time you go through something you dislike; remember; it's GOOD FOR YOU! Man... how do you do smilely faces in here?    DAILY VERSE   We know that [trials] are good for us--they help us learn to endure.   -Romans 5:3 / (NLT)     DEVOTIONAL   How will you know the depth of your character? God allows pain to help his people mature. The key is to turn to God and rely on him for endurance.

       Hey guys.  Anyway, I dragged Kevin (you know, from church... with the car and stuff. xD) into our little blogging community. =D So, welcome him! Yup. Who knows, maybe the entire church will be pulled in. But as for now, there are five members! And they are... Cho, Young, Leighton, Kevin, and me. =B I hope you guys enjoy this community thing. Please don't abuse it! >__  Oh, and check out Kevin's "coolio" site he made. Very simplistic and nicely laid out. Maybe we shall have Kevin spice up our community blog. Yea?  Well, enjoy. =D And remember, Jesus rocks all of our socks! =P (Haha... Young.) Later everyone!

       Someone requested John 3:16 as today's daily verse so I put that on my xanga and my profile if you guys want to read that. But today's real daily verse; here it is.   DAILY   VERSE   He has sent me to proclaim that captives will be released, that the blind will see, that the downtrodden will be freed from their oppressors, and that the time of the Lord's favor has come.   -Luke 4:18 / (NLT)     DEVOTIONAL   Jesus came to be a prison-breaker. Allow him to touch the chains that bind your heart, and he will set you free.

       Hello everyone. I just got back from church. Great to see you guys there by the way. Anyway, after reading Cho's little devotional post (the part where God wants us to share the Gospel with friends and family), I figured I might ask for a prayer from you guys.  As Christians, part of our duty is to share Christ and our beliefs with other people we interact with. We are especially called on to share Christianity to those who do not know about Christ, and to those who have heard of Christ but do not accept Him. Yeah, it's a pretty tough job. It's not easy to be a Christian. I'm sure you guys have experienced some kind of persecution and rejection. 'Tis not fun.  Well, ever since I came to accept Christ (two to three years ago), my main and top desire is to bring my family (mainly parents) to Christ. And, I'm sure some of you guys also have that same desire. But let me say that God will always listen to your prayers and will act upon those prayers that are according to His wills. I have seen little outreaches to my parents here and there, and God does intervene slowly. Of course, it requires much patience. But it's okay, just keep on praying. Prayer is powerful. =D And you'll be suprised.  So, I guess my little prayer request is to have God work within us and give us the strength to reach out to those we love, and also for God to intervene in those who do not yet accept and to soften their hearts. And also, another little prayer request for my cousin who just recently came from China (a month ago). He doesn't know much English, and will be attending high school, year 11. I believe he will pick up his English skills very efficiently, but I just hope that everything will flow smoothly. =D Maybe one day he will come to church.  Thank you for your time! And of course, I'll keep you guys in prayer. God bless!

         8/7/04     DAILY VERSE   How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news of peace and salvation!   -Isaiah 52:7 / (NLT)     DEVOTIONAL   There is no greater news than the message of Christ's forgiveness and glory. You may feel inadequate, but God wants you to share his gospel with friends and family. And he wants to bless you for this wonderful work!

       Okay, I changed the layout. o_o The orange/yellow one didn't turn out that well... Sorry Young. =P Other changes, I added the "who we are" paragraph and "miscellaneous links." You are more than welcome to add to the links list, provided that you know how to use HTML. =P If not, just let me know and I'll simply add it. Any other ideas and such are welcome too.  Oh, I might make use of avatars/icons. Once I know how to manipulate those, I'll ask you to submit your own icon. I'll upload it to my own server, and hopefully that will work out. In the meantime, it'll just be our user name at the end of each post.  I hope you guys all enjoy! =D
