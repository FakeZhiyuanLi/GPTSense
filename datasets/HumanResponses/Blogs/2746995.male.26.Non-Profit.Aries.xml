          Tonite is Madonnarama, and I think I'm gonna pass on this one. Madonnarama has a strange connotation with me now, post-SB, and usually involved hurtling a empty glass at raving idiots.   So, I'm passing on Madonna, and will cuddle up to the bar tonite and drown my sorrows at the passing of Ronald Reagan. Thank God the bastard is out of his misery. I wonder what they'll name after him now. Maybe the state of Montana. Reagan's death has, naturally, saturated the TV news programs, but I did manage to watch the Belmont Stakes today. I don't know why I like horse racing. Maybe its the butch in me. But I was a little sad to see Smarty Jones, a true rags-to-riches story, lose by half a length at the very end. Its amazing I can cry at a horse losing, but when an American President kicks the bucket, I laugh it off. Damn, I'm such a smug, bleeding-heart liberal. I love me.  Quick note: Why are they playing Amazing Grace at Cyberstop right now? The Reagan thing have reached a fevered pitch. Shit, I need a drink.

                         My friends, I give you the Talented Mister Ripley himself, Matt Damon.  Last night was an interesting event, complete with a handful of vodka sodas and sightings of Dupont's finest and not so fine. Tonite, a trip to JR's is in order, and possibly followed by a jaunt to Apex. Who knows. Something to cure my boredom. Maybe I'll go boy-hunting. I haven't really been on the prowl in a while, and the lack of a romantic interest has me kinda bored. So, I guess I'll get liquored up and go hunting. In the end, I can always make out with Jonah. *sigh*  I think I'll make a trip to Georgetown tomorrow and see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. If I have the time. There's a 10:30am showing, but I'm not sure how appropriate sitting in a room full of 10 year-olds and their parents and smelling of booze.

      Nothing says fun like another night of Gong Show Karaoke at Cobalt. It's been my favorite night of the week for a while, and for the longest, its been mine and Melissa's "date night" of the week, as roommates go. When we first started going, we didn't know a soul, as... well... I didn't exactly run in "karaoke circles."  But over time, we grew to be friends with a number of regulars. Lucia was quick to point out last week that in our drunken fun, there's always one random boy I seem to either be kissing, or running from. For two weeks in a row back in the spring, I fled from a military policeman on leave from South Korea, only to find him somehow coming back to my apartment (clearly, the ol' "can i use your bathroom" thing worked with me that time...).   Last night was quite intolerable, as I wasn't drinking, and clearly everyone else way. Melissa's rousing rendition of Natural Woman, which I'm sure she dedicated to the middle-aged lesbian losing her hair and who kept dancing like a weirdo and playing with the lights, the TV screens, and whatever else she could find, was a smash. Ry, our infamous onmisexual Halle Berry lookalike was mauling some guy in the face by the end of the evening, and Peter was wasted and shouting expletives at me. And poor Clint. Poor Clint. Our resident drunk actually fell asleep in the middle of it all, and would awake every few minutes to steal more of Lucia's cigs. Lucia, of course, would oggle the male singers, and then yell, "Take it off!"  As for me, I had to flee from a rather strange, newly-out-of-the-closet Maryland-raised, Virgina-dwelling fag who kept insisting I come to his pool party this Sunday. I swiftly lost his phone number he'd jotted down on a napkin and sucked down the vodka soda he'd bought me, and managed my way out of the bar.  Can't wait til next week, were I can return to singing drunken renditions of "My Way" and oggling the bartenders.  God help me.

      Associated Press: Woman Accused of Spreading Dog Feces   PORTLAND, Maine - A Portland woman accused of spreading dog feces at Deering Oaks Park as part of a vendetta against its weekly farmer's market has been banned from the park and charged with criminal mischief.   Lora Leland, 53, was caught early Saturday emptying 16 bags of dog feces in the road that winds through the center of the park, police said. She explained that she was angry at the Saturday morning farmer's market because it interfered with her ability to ride her bicycle through the park, police said.   [Ed.

          With the June 4 release of the third Harry Potter film, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, President George W. Bush today provided White House pool reporters with a rendition of himself mounting a umbrella.  Seriously, I can't wait to see this movie. Perhaps its the inclusion of Gary Oldman and Emma Thompson into the cast, or maybe its Hermione with tits and wearing jeans. I thought about getting tix to go see it at the special 10am showing in Georgetown, but the thought of getting up and having to sit through it with five hundred small children would be rather disastrous. Maybe I'll wait til the crowd dies down. That gives me time to read the book again.  By the way, doesn't anyone keep noticing the President's mysterious third eyebrow (above his left brow) that disappears and reappears? I'm waiting for a trip to the WH by the Fab Five. It would be just nice to see Thom guiding GW around the East Room, highlighting changes he's made to add "warmth and texture."

      I am completely over this week-long funeral to President Reagan. Put the man in the ground, already. As Phil notably said last night, the only thing that could knock Ronnie off the TV would be if the Pope kicked it. Yeah, JP2 is definitely on my death pool. And Ernest Borgnine.  Gay Pride is this week, and with that comes the torrential downpour of queens I've never seen before. Who knew Maryland had this many fags?   After chatting with Jeff, Ron and Hermione (Jonah) last night, Phil and I jaunted on down to Cobalt to have Serhuy, Sergei, (fuck, how does he spell his name?) get us plastered. Phil decided it was time to meander on to Cleveland Park for reasons unknown, so I stayed behind and cavorted about with Dupont Circle's finest. Parade tomorrow, rain or shine. Bad techno and muscle marys in scary outfits. I love it.  Tonite's festivities will include libations at Juke's, before I meet up with Pepin. Hopefully I won't be falling down stairs tonite. Pepin offered to "prop me up," but I think there's a double meaning in that.  As for the rest of the weekend, Jeff's moving in, and Ben will be writing about 8,000 cover letters. If not, I'm just gonna end up working at the Crew Club, cleaning shit off the walls.  And I realize I have neglected to mention that I finally got to see the new Harry Potter movie. It saddens me to admit my deep-seeded lust for Draco Malfoy, but I must say the film itself was brilliant. Much more adult. Not as silly. Loved the score. And how about that Emma Thompson! One note, though. Who the fuck is that fat black kid?? And why did he have so many lines?? I can't wait for Goblet of Fire, but it looks like I've got until November 2005 before it comes out. That gives me the chance to read it about 67 more times.  [Ed. note: Reagan. Still dead.]

      For some reason, I drink vodka like its water. After downing a couple Rose Kennedys at JRs last night, I ran into Clint (who was awake this time) and his friend Ron. After downing a few more, Michael and Erich showed up, and we happily consumed a few more adult beverages, before Michael, Erich and I made our way to Chaos (via McDonalds). Mikey joined us there, and after a fab drag show and a little dancing, we headed to that place where queers go to die, Windows.   By Drink #12, Ben was bombed, and ended the evening by breaking my glass by tossing it (as well as a chair, apparently) over the balcony. Which lead to us being thrown out of Windows. Which led to me missing the last five stairs of the stairwell and resulted in Ben landing on his ass, legs in the air. I woke up at 2pm this afternoon butt naked in my bedroom with no recollection of anything after the drag show.  I have to meet Phil at the bar in less two hours, so I thought I'd make a quick entry into my blog.  [Note: Ronald Reagan, still dead.]

      I've been in a mood this week over my job and my financial situation. But thats nothing new. Its just been more hard-pressed this week, I suppose. Having spent much of the week dying in bed of a fever, I managed to nurse myself back to health. But with the lack of a roommate, things can be quite boring around here. So, I forced myself to go out tonite, alone, to JR's.   After running into Jonah briefly, I was quarantined into a conversation with two blokes that ran for about three hours of sheer boredom, and I doubt I'm better off because of it. I like social comradery, and my folks were not on the town tonite. Clizzah did stop y and say hello, and for that, I am thankful. I suppose I should have just stayed in and watched Jeff's new porn collection.   I can feel myself getting into moods more and more lately about things. Mainly where I want my life to lead me career-wise, as well as if I actually want to stay in Washington. There is also that point in the evening where I have to ask myself if I am happy being single and if I yearn something more. And then I make my list of boys of who I want to make out with and then I realize I am a complete moron.  I should make a list for the blog. Michael would be entertained. Although, I would guess by now, he could name the list all by himself.

      To many things going on today. Jeff's moving some stuff, I've got interviews to deal with, and even more to schedule.  Big news of the day is another American has been beheaded by Al Aqada. There's also some interesting news floating around the net about a March/April event at Dirksen involving Rev. Moon crowning himself the Messiah, and now the fifteen or so House and Senate members who were there are scrambling to avoid the bad press of being there. I love http://politics1.com. Such interesting news.  In other news. Boys, boys, boys. (Shaking my head.)  And now, the weekend begins.

      Old soldiers don't die. They just fade away. So goes the old Douglas MacArthur saying. In these gay old times, it has been revised. Old drag queens don't die, they just seek more applause.  I didn't even want to leave my apartment tonite, but if I'd seen one more back-to-back episode of "Whose Laugh Is It Anyway?," I might have killed someone. Having slowly recovered from my cold, I decided that I did need to return to my Wednesday Night staple, Gong Show Karaoke at Cobalt.  Unfortunately, it was a bad scene all around. Now don't get me wrong, I love the ladies. But in recent weeks, Karaoke has definitely been infultrated by lesbians. I akin it to the Nazi infultration of Anne Frank's humble abode. Now, the ladies control the show, freely gonging every sober fag who can't hit a note at 11pm. (Show begins at 9:30 or so, well.. might as well say 10:15) The worse part was Porter, having to deal with drag queen screw-ups. I love Porter.  Regardless, the Lesbian Iraqi Governing Council now have their blessed Karaoke Night.  It was a fun night. Right up until a certain pseudo drag queen/soft drink landed her face in Peter's crotch and pretended to perform fellatio.  Taxi!!  Lucia and I made it to her place to make omelets and to discuss my shortfalls as a human being, as well as her beliefs in higher beings (or lack there of). And then it was clearly time to go. Well. She was passed out on the floor.  Three more interviews to schedule. Boston, Los Angeles and Miami. Oh dear. Choices to make.

      Fletch Lives may be my favorite Chevy Chase movie, and I think that its certainly the funniest. I couldn't sleep a wink tonite, so I watched it. Twice. And then sent out 20 resumes.  And I was ready to go to bed, but now there are a gaggle of Mexicans in the courtyard putting in shrubery.  Fuck shrubery!

      Bloggers everywhere are reposting this hilarious Craigslist entry. Don't know if its true or not, but it may very well be the most entertaining thing I've read. This is why online sex hookups are just BAD. But hey, it makes for a good story, I suppose.   Reply to: anon-33545771@craigslist.org Date: 2004-06-11, 11:29PM EDT  I arrived home yesterday and found a message in my inbox that read as follows:   O.K. Handsome, I'm choosing you. My original thought was to have you go right to my room, but you wouldn't get past the front desk, without my electronic key card, or all your info waiting at the front desk, so we'll do it this way instead.   Tomorrow night, Friday June 11th at 7.p.m. I'll be at the Starbucks on 41st and Broadway, if you're not familliar with it, you can find directions on mapquest or google starbucks for a list...whatever.... I'll know it's you because you'll wait for me right on the corner, outside on 41st in front of Starbucks, stop at one of the korean candy stores and buy a single carnation, any color...... I'll come and get you between 7 and 7:15 give or take a minute for traffic... i'll be cabbing it....   Unless the look of you scares me, i'll take you back to my room, but you must understand that we're not hanging out all night after, i will probably just ask you leave....sometime before 10p.m, i have a phone call coming that i will need privacy for....   I don't want a million questions or a hassle, but do e-mail me back with a yes i'll see you there or a no, i'm sorry i can't make it....   if you don't e-mail me back by tomorrow at noon, i will make other plans......   ciao  Theresa  p.s your cock is huge.... it better look like that...   I wondered where this came from. Like most guys in this city, well, in this world, I try and hit on as many women as is humanly possible in order to up the odds of the eventual connection....and on CL it works no different. So I searched through the CE section for "theresa" and found an ad I must have responded to that read as follows:   Handsome Only for this weekend fri or sat...one time - w4m - 27 (manhattan)   I'm tall 5foot8, (you must be taller than me)blonde hair (not a dumb blonde)I am very slender and sexy and i'm not interested in someone that is not very good looking and in shape,... no freaks or weirdos, safe sex means you will wear a condom.... I will be in nyc for just 5 more days.. I am staying at the manhattan east suite hotel, and i am looking for a one time....maybe two-time encounter....fri or sat.... I will only respond to those who send a photo....  If you are a cutie, i may just let you come over and make me cum.... I'm visiting from L.A. and yes i am horny, i have someone back home, so i'm not looking for anything more than this, there will be no hey let me have your e-mail address or phone # crap.... Lets enjoy each other and move on....  send photo, and a few thoughts for what you'd like to do when i answer the door naked....   --Theresa   "Is this my lucky day?" I asked myself. The response seemed intriguing...if a little pat...a 5'8" blonde nympho from L.A. with her run of a suite in manhattan to fuck for three hours in! Why the hell not? The flower thing seemed a little corny...but god knows I've done cornier for women. The use of the words "candy store" seemed a little suspect...I think that's Queensish slang...but I've overlooked worse in the past. My cock really wasn't all that big in the pic (you try keeping a full on hard on while fiddling with your gfs digital camera)...but maybe she was just being nice, flirty, sexy.   What the hell...I decided to go for it!   All day I was stuck in a meeting at work. Half the time with a hardon thinking about fucking that blonde for my allotted 3 hours that evening. Strange fantasies ran through my head. First the usual sex ones which we get enough of on here already. Then darker fantasies...what if this is some kind of way of jacking guys in hotels like in that Outkast song???...what if this is a reality TV show or something on MTV, or maybe that ABD documentary...what if this is just a hoax? "Oh well, what's the worst that could happen?" I thought.   The meeting threatened to run late. So I started making attempts to halt it so I could get out to my LA blonde. I dropped hints of the futility of addressing the issue today. Why don't we all just think about it over the weekend...etc....etc. Finally we adjourned...and I ran to the bathroom to pee before heading home for a quick shower and change of clothes. As I stood peeing in the urial, I farted. But wait...that was no fart. A runny stream had come out my bum and had the realization that I had shit my pants for the first time in 25 years. While still holding my dick in one hand I reached my other hand into my pants to cover my asshole and lessen the damage. Luckily the bathroom was empty...so I did a sort of strange straddle step into the stall and began cleaning up. Off with the boxers which I laid onto the floor. All the while I'm thinking I'll be late...I need to go...NOW! I finished wiping up, exited the stall, threw the boxers in the trash and covered them with the litter to conceal the evidence, washed the shit off my hands and ran out of the bathroom.   I hop into the first elevator, alone. I press L, for the lobby floor and the elevator moves for a minute then makes a small noise. Then nothing. I wait...and wait...and wait...for a whole 2 New york minutes then push the alarm. A friendly Purto Rican fellow comes on the intercom and talks me through it...and in 5 minutes I'm out.   I run into the subway..the train is just pulling into the station. I hop onto it...get to my stop...run off...all the while thinking of fucking that blonde Cali Nympho! After a shower and clothes change at my place I run to buy the carnation...but they're only sold by the bunch...which I purchase. Running down back to catch the train to Times Square I duck into another deli and buy some altoids in case the breath is kicking. Then the whole candid camera "they're all gonna laugh at you" fear kicks in again. I ask the storekeep for a bag...and place the flowers in it upside down to hide them from any possible reality tv camera.   I ride the subway up. Exit the station. Walk a block up Broadway and see there is convention of men holding bouquets of carnations...all colors. The men are varied too...PR, Black, White, Hipsters, Suits & Ties...all looking for that ever fleeting cheap piece of ass.   I throw my flowers in the nearest trash can...and hop on the first train home.   this is in or around Manhattan it's NOT ok to contact  this poster with services or other commercial interests

      I think I've got strep throat, or in the very least, a cold. Sore throat and a fever thats pretty much kept me bedridden for the last two days.   FoodBar finally got back in touch with me, so that looks to be a go. I also got an interview with Public Citizen for an Organizer position.  I suppose I should go take more medicine, but I really have no idea what to take. And, truth be told, I really should drink more water. I'm so dehydrated.  And I should probably shave my face. I'm going to start looking like Tom Hanks in CAST AWAY soon. Not pretty.

      So today began my latest excursion into the art of being a waiter. I've waited tables before, and forgot what a thankless, sweaty job it was. Thankfully, the new place is very different from good ole Court Street Cafe in Florence, Alabama. For one, its a hell of a lot gayer, and you're mostly outside, so you don't smell of friend chicken when you leave.  I also forgot how exciting it is to meet new people, especially when you're in the same boat of madness, running cocktails and platters of calamari and such out to crazy, bitter fags who you know are going to stiff you in the end, and not in a good way.  Today was training day for Ben behind the hostess stand, where I followed around Brian, a rather dainty 20yo from UMD. The crew tonite read like a list of gay Real Worlders: Vanna, the 20-something Asian male newly in DC from Colorado; James, who's hair is bigger than mine; J-Lo, the MTF tranny who doesn't speak English and is slow as molasses; Di, the funniest black girl I've ever met; Gidget, who's real name is Chris, and who decided to quit within the first hour of tonite's shift; and Kipp, the musclely bartender. Tomorrow, I'm training on running and bussing food, which should end up being a fresh hell.  I ran off to JR's for a bit tonite, mainly because I was jumping with energy and needed to get rid of it somehow. I ended the night lasting longer than showtunes, and watching a group of four Europeans drunkenly sing national anthems in the corner of the bar. I'm not sure that it was time well spent, but at least I know the words to the Dutch National Anthem.

      Its amazing how easily I get bored. Especially on the weekends. I was scheduled to work the Sunday brunch shift, but since DC is pretty dead this weekend with NYC Pride and all, I wasn't needed. I piddled around the house, and then met Phil for a drink at JR's. Phil was in a mood, so he left, and I decided to pick up some food and head home.  In my sheer boredom, I decided it was time to return to JR's, which wasn't that great of an idea, since no one was really out. Well, Jonah was out, but he's always out. I did run into the Karaoke crew and chatted for a bit, before they decided it was time for them to leave as well. People with jobs, I tell ya.   So, I kurtzied up to Tommy's well, and drank a couple more, chatting with some Brazillian named Frank. Very odd fellow, with broken English, who wouldn't stop telling me how cute I was. Take a number, Frank.  I'd had enough of our Brazillian beefcake, and decided I was done for the evening. Only to run into the FoodBar crowd. Yvette was smashed out of her mind, and ended up peeing outside of Lizard. So, yeah. I went to Lizard. And then the gang decided they wanted to go to Red. Interesting choice, since I'd be the only gay white boy there. But no dice, they wanted to charge Joe and I a $10 cover, we instead we stood outside the door and waited. I'm not really sure why. For a time, we were going to try to sneak in, but I doubt the 300-lbs bouncer would have liked that.  More job interviews to schedule, and I've got three shifts to work this week. I really do like it there, but the money is entirely too unpredictable. We'll see how this works out. In the end, we all know I'll have to resort to prostitution.   *sigh*

      I begin this blog entry with a reminder that its always a good idea for you to make sure that when you go out with out-of-town friends that you knew from high school, its always a good idea to stock up on bottled water...  Erin, one of my best friends from high school, and her friend Kirsten (pronounced KURSTEN, because thats how that do it in Wyoming) have come for a vist this weekend. E and K like in Manhattan, and its always a good thing to have 2 straight girlfriends who live in a place named after a drink.  I worked the brunch shift today, and spent most of my morning trying to recuperate from a massive hangover, sweating like a pig in the mid-day sun, and staring at Vanna's Cambodian fine ass. At around 5, the E and K arrived, so we decided to plan our evening... which resulted in something like 9 rounds of Cosmopolitans at FoodBarDC (thanks Yvette) and Cobalt (thanks Porter)... followed by a trip to Annie's.  Erin, shockingly enough, was comepletely fucked up by the end of the evening, and Kirsten (KURSTEN, or she'll yell at me) was making out with some straight guy named Joey. They're always named Joey.  I did get another look at Vanna's ass tonite, but beyond that it was pretty worthless. After me and the ladies made asses out of ourselves at Chaos (no foul there) we decided it was time to head back to the Cairo...  I'm just glad that Erin only vomited twice.  Welcome to my weekend.  Tomorrow: BBQ at J-Bird's "John Edwards' Mutual Masturbation Party"  ... I be strokin'.

      I finally met my crush. We made out. Oh happy day.  Yesterday sucked at work. Micros went down, and orders weren't going in, and we were getting slammed all at the same time when the micros system went down. Not pretty. Probably my least fun shift ever of waiting tables.  I decided to relieve the stress and head to Cobalt, where J and I ran into virtually everyone we know. I ran into my new crush, who's actually an old crush... so to speak... we then like true trailer trash, swapped spit in front of the Cairo, as my neighbors all strolled in. It was pure Heaven. =)  I can report that while there were no Andy Dick on Crack sightings at Cobalt, there were at least two earlier in the day.

      Why in God's name do I love Maroon 5? If it wasn't for the ubiquitous "This Love" (people call me on my cell when they play the remix at JR's. I am clearly too gay...) then my mind was made up by watching Kelly Preston slobber over the lead singer. I don't know if I agree with the video interpretation of the song, as I find a much sweeter meaning in the song. Damn me for being a romantic.  Its been a while since I blogged, so I should update you on the homefront. Kerry is now the Democratic nomiee. Theresa likes to say "shove it." I've given up on boys and have now decided the best way to get laid is to pluck unsuspecting virginal lesbians from Ladies' Night at Chaos.  That was a joke.  I'm off to galivant around Dupont, which should yield interesting stories. Hopefully, I won't run into Charles, my new 50-something stalker, who shaves his receding hairline and asks me about pointers for getting his eyebrows waxed. I beleive this marriage wasn't meant to be when he shoved his tongue down my throat for no reason, while shoving $2 in my pocket.  $2?  And then he asked if I wanted to go to Annapolis with him to get crabs. No thank you mame. I can get crabs here.  Mojito?
