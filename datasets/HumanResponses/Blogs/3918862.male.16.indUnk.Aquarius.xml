      Yes I know that we all do stupid things from time to time. Then there are those who are just completely and utterly retarded. They are too stupid to just make our lives easier and die.  urlLink The Darwin Awards  congratulates those who are at least stupid enough to die for the good of the planet. No they don't die on purpose but sometimes it does seemed like they tried to. Ok well yes anyway. I know some of you have already made your guesses on who I was going to mention: Bush, Jessica Simpson, The Pope, whoever. Well anyway my point is. Of course these people don't know they are stupid or if they do they don't believe it.    That's why I want to start a company (thanks to John Heffron for that bit) where you can send the person (whomever) a card, movie, or I don't a billboard if your budget accepts it telling these people that they are dumb and that they really need to stop and think before they speak. Maybe not a billboard because that's mean but you get the idea. Anyway, if you really don't like somebody because they are dumb then yes it is your duty, no, your obligation to tell them. They deserve to know. I know I would want to know who thinks that I'm sub-intelligent so that I could just shut up on certain things. I know many of you are going to comment on me telling me that I'm dumb and need to shut up. Oh well I don't care if that's how you feel then go for it.    Basically my point is, if you have a problem with somebody then tell them. No matter what it is. If you think they are stupid tell them. If they bother you in any way just tell them. It's much easier on them and you...sometimes. Yes I know that it could go horribly wrong and they could hate you forever and ever. That's only the negative part though. They could I don't know maybe change and you might actually be able to stand to be around them. Just let them know. They deserve at least that. I know I do.

      I just got out of a really really long talk all the while listening to my customized music station on one  urlLink Yahoo music video thing . Well anyway yes during the conversation I noticed that certain songs made me do and say certain things. For one, at one point I would change my display name depending on a lyric, or song title, or something to that effect. Yes I do know the fact that staring at a screen for 3 straight hours without looking any where else and being sleep deprived might also have something to do with my nature but that's contradictory to my point so they shall be left out. Oh yes by the way  urlLink Brand New-Sic Transit Gloria  is a really awesome song/video. Everyone check it out. Ok anyway continuing. Retractions; I do believe I've said things that some people might take offensive like the fact that Jessica Simpson is of the devil along with Toby Keith. Also that rap and hip-hop oh and I would also like to add here R&amp;B are faithful servants of the devil. Well I would like to publicly renounce these statements...no I don't like that too much. Nevermind the statement shall stay. Oh yes one more thing. Some people I see don't really like the same music as I do. I would of have to be totally distraught and ignore this person for ever and ever. But I learned something. Just because you like crap when it comes to music doesn't make you any less of a good person...well it does but not by too much. Plus I kind of like to talk to the person who likes the crap music so that doesn't help. Remember this one thing when it comes to music. Castro is old, therefore all old people are communist.    Possibly to be Continued...    urlLink

      Ok this is kind of just exactly like something I did in 9th grade but it bears repeating. I still say that, ok I lost my train of thought...well its gone. Ok I'll just talk about the effects of music on the human body or well my human body. See par example Fuel-Won't back down (Bring you Hell remix) just came on my little online music video radio thing. Anyway, the second I heard that first note I really started to anticipate the song. The notes come in measure by measure and then the words and I'm totally exhilarated. This song has woken me up. It has done things that caffeine and speed have tried to do to me for the longest time. Why then shouldn't I be allowed to use music as a drug or is what I'm trying to say is music a drug? Yeah sure, that'll be the new topic of my random talkingness...Ok so ignore everything to this point. OK.     Is music a drug? I know that I'm addicted to it. I've bought it off the street, I've had sleepless nights because of it, and yes I've tried to snort it. By the way it doesn't work. You have to shoot it. So anyway. Is it the type of music? and why does different music affect different people differently? I believe that in these latter days I was put on the Earth to show people the correct way that is rock music. In these evil times where Satan has sent his minions on the Earth to destroy us like with Jessica Simpson, Brittany Spears and Toby Keith. Not to mention his faithful servants in the rap and hip-hop genres. Well I don't want this to be too long so I think that I'll end here. I'll make sure to add to this later. So don't be too worried I won't leave you hanging. Look here does this make it better?                                   TO BE CONTINUED...

      Hm. My name is Sam and I'm just a laid back don't really care about anything kind of person. I won't touch all of the political issues because well one, everyone feels my views are wrong and two I just don't really care right now. Maybe once I get back in school and am forced to look into political things I just might. I might post every once in a while about some retard in the Phillipines who blew himself up on the steps of the capital for his people and then the following week when we go to war with them. I doubt it though. I will usually only talk about the things that I understand and most politics I don't. Ok I just bored myself and you. So...about me.  urlLink Look here.

      I heard this phrase last whenever. I must say, I find this quite true. I really was not sure if it was meant as a compliment or not but not seeing really how it could be a compliment I'm going to go with not. Well, it could be a compliment in the way that I might be fairly good at something. I'm not sure what it would be because I was only half paying attention because my "friends" were singing a hilariously depressing song. Yes that's right hilariously depressing. So anyway, back to me having no life. Everything that seems to happen is just slowly convincing me more and more about it. For the bad. So yeah, it's 1 in the morning and I'm sitting typing on the computer when I should be sleeping because I'm freaking tired from hanging out at my step dad's company picnic. Yeah see, no life. I am going to go to sleep do nothing all day tomorrow and there's a good possibility I'll do nothing all day Monday either or Tuesday. Oh but not Wednesday, that's the day I have to sit there for 9 freaking hours while pictures are taken for a wedding. Thursday and again on Friday I get to stand in line for 12 hours wearing a freaking tux because they want me in the stupid line and they decided to have two stupid receptions. That means I get to end out the week doing boring crap and I only have one week left of summer. Oh don't worry I won't be doing anything then either because well, I have no life.

      Funniest show ever aired. Thousands of people audition for a chance to be one of ten people in a house to live together for like a month so that America can decide who is the funniest person in America. It's kind of like  urlLink American Idol , but you know without all of the horrible singing and gay people...well minus Ant. Anyway they eliminate people by having battles, they all vote on who they know they are funnier than. The person with the most votes picks a person to go head to head with and the audience decides who's funnier. The least funny person is eliminated. It went to 5 then they brought one back for the wildcard. The final 6 are cut down to 3 which is cut down to just one. The Last Comic Standing.  urlLink John Heffron . Easily the funniest man in America. Watching the show from the beginning where they have all the crappy people is good, but it becomes easily quite annoying. People are freaking moronic. The same played out jokes are  NOT  funny. Anyway, Last Comic Standing, John Heffron. Funniest man in America. Blah Blah Blah. Hilarious show, watch the new episode Tuesday at sometime or another on NBC.  Oh yeah, freaking Jay Mohr licked Ant after Ant kissed him during the 2 hour special...he licked him...on the face...on live tv...yeah...that's a new kind of freaky. What do you possibly say to that?

      That's all you can do. When all of these "problems" come your way.  "So what's the use of making lies up, when promises have dried up, go out in the end."-Authority Zero-"Find your way". Basically, you don't really have a reason to lie when the promises we tell each other don't work out anyway. What's the use of making a promise when you know you are lying right from the start? You know, I thought I could trust people. There are some certain situations where betraying somebody's confidence is ok. This wasn't one of them.  I got a fortune cookie the other day at Chin Wah. It said, "You should make new friends".  Hmmm, I am over reacting a tad, but still I did learn a lesson from all of this. Keep everything to myself. People, no matter who, can not be trusted. Smiling seems to be the only thing I can do that seems to make sense of the whole situation. I can't yell or scream, hit anybody...Well. I can't swear, complain, just basically I can't do anything about it. Except smile.

      Ugh. School starts on the 30th and well I have to say I have somewhat mixed feelings. First I have to read a stupid huge book. The Grapes of Wrath. Ugh. I know it's supposed to be a good book, "classic literature" but I just can't start reading it. Oh well. I just got back from changing my schedule which took freakin' forever, and I dropped a couple classes and added them with what I hope are going to be somewhat interesting subjects. I dropped Intro to Film,business Law, and Comparative Gov. AP. I'll take CGAP next year with all my friends. I now have Creative Writing 2 (not with the cool teacher though), Electronics (which I'm stoked for kind of), and Computer Programming 1&amp;2 (which could go either way). I don't know Junior year couldn't be that bad. At least I can leave school. Plus Audrey is going this year. Nice. That means I can actually see her without her parents putting the lockdown on. I saw her for like 30 seconds today while she was at volleyball but that isn't enough by far. Hmmm this is more like a freaking journal entry than what I normally write. Oh well. Hmmm I guess I do need somewhat of a topic. A point to be argued. Screw it, I can't think of anything. Ugh. I don't feel like wakeboarding right now. I am so tired...

      Nice. I finally have something to play that sounds somewhat normal that everyone can load fairly quick. It's the Halloween theme in case anyone didn't know. I'm sure I will keep adding to my site as I find new and better things to put in it. I saw a guy that had a scrolling marquee thing. That's the kind of stuff I want. So yes, I will one day have all of the special things that will make my blog the best. Now if only somebody would read my blog then I will be set...

      I recently had the extreme pleasure of seeing M. Night Shyamalan's "The Village". And from my opening sentence you should be able to tell I really liked the movie. As I asked others about their views on this particular film I was quite shocked at the exactness of the answers. Most people either loved it, like me, or hated it. I try to explain that just because a movie that you think is going to be scary doesn't necessarily scare you doesn't make it a bad movie. The Village is not a scary movie at all. There are intense parts and yes even I jumped once or twice, but I tell you this, it's not at all what the trailers lead you to believe. It is a beautifully written script and an amazing twist which I won't say here or possibly ever because I hate it when that happens. I never saw The Others for that very reason, but anyway back on subject. The critics love this movie and I know why. I don't want to say the ignorant are the ones that don't like this movie, but I guess it would have to be more the people that go to movies to just sit there mindlessly and be entertained without ever having to think. If you go to a movie to actually be entertained on a higher level then definitely go see The Village. The way it all fits together and works is amazing. Of course there will be those in the theater that will claim to have known that is how it was going to work out the entire time. BS! But yeah, just go and see it and until I figure out how to make a poll comment on this post and tell me if you liked it or not and if not then why.

      I realize I don't have the motivation right now for a blog. A lot of stuff has been happening...not really I'm just lazy. Well whatever I'll just talk about something since I'm on right now. I don't really have a topic but, hmmm one sec let me think. Wow I have really bad eyes without my contacts in. I can't see what I'm typing from where I sit. I have to lean forward to tell whether or not it makes sense. Ok oh I know ummm starting now I make a commitment to write something at least once a week. I highly doubt I will keep it because I highly doubt anybody will hold me to it. So this post ends and I will start a new one right now.
