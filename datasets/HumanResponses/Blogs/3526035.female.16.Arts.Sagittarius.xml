      the clock is ticking, ever ticking.  couting down the moments with infinite slowness.  tick.  tock.  tick.  tock.  measuring my descent into madness.     don't look back can't turn back now just let it pull you a long there's no stopping it no don't look back you can't do that run faster now you can outrun him hurry up get up now keep running keep running it's almost on you you can't stop now you're so close almost there just don't look back.    fitter happier more productive.   the night air kisses my bare legs, my thighs brushed by a skirt that is too short for my father and too long for almost anyone else.  but here i am anyway, the comforting sound of flipflops on the pavement that's ever more reassuring than the click of heels on a marble floor.  i like the darkness here.  and music surrounds my head, wrapping me up in the velvet voice of some man coming from far away.  he no longer sings but the smooth sound of his voice has been captured on some device somewhere, to wrap me in the cushion of his voice.  i am alone here, but for the beat of my own heart i am infinite.

      yeah, so.  another day another journal.  i have a blog for every mood and every part of life that i happen to be in at that very moment.  this particular journal is dedicated to the moment that i stared up at my ceiling, vodka for blood, and couldnt see the world beyond your eyes.  and everything i remembered of you crystalized out of time's flow as i reached out for a fragment of words, an elusive rhthym, struggling on wisps of startled air.  But i could make no sound, and what I had remembered fled in a deathless song.

      remember when i said i was running away from my livejournal.  yeah now im retreating from my xanga.  i metaphorically killed myself off, as it is.  i think its gotten too much for me.  or maybe i just like to run away (literally run away) from my problems.  i left lj because i despised meg, and pretty much hated people there that i couldnt talk to, and im leaving xanga because sean's an ass and alex is fucking faith.  what the hell kind of name is that anyway- "faith."  i knew i should i hate that girl- faith is the enemy of knowledge.  maybe im overreacting here, maybe the "he" is somebody else, but i think it isn't.  i think her he is my he.  i dunno why this is bothering me so much its not like we were anything and ive been trying to get over him for months and proclaiming that i was over him, and here is the evidence that i was nothing to him, and it should mean nothing to me.  i always imagined myself getting over him, but never him getting over me.  i never really imagined him with anybody but me.  i dont want to go back there anymore.  i loved him like I love the sun.
