      Last week, following the political unrests spreading to all the universities of the country, the Iranian ruling clergy sent the same note to their European friends, including Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister that they had sent to George Bush before: Leave us alone and let us deal with the students and the opposition the way we wish. You want our oil, well, buy and take it. This is the main message conveyed to all the countries and international organizations criticizing the violation of human rights in Iran, expressed in different languages during the past twenty four years. However, now that Iranian youth have lost all hope in any reformation taking place within the present Iranian ruling system and the United States of America and her allies have established their forces near Eastern and Western frontiers of Iran in Iraq and Afghanistan, is the situation still as before?Twenty four years ago, when the Iranian people poured out into the streets protesting against the Shah's despotic rule, the students had a special day, when they protested and shouted slogans against the ruling system. On September 7, 1964 the Shah's Regime opened fire at the students who demonstrated against the Richard Nixon's trip to Iran. Three students were killed and ever since then, the monarchy faced yearly demonstrations and protests throughout the country for twenty four years.In the last year of the Shah's reign, when the students poured out into the streets in the memory of the above three students killed by the regime's special forces, the clergy gave many speeches for them and provoked them to fight against the ruling system that had shot their friends, and now, some twenty years later the children of the same students have their own day to protest, this time against those very clergies that are now ruling them. On July 9, 1999, the pro-clergy forces invaded the students' campus of the Tehran University, one person was killed, a female student disappeared and one of the students lost his eye and tens were brutally injured. Facing collective protests of millions of people, the clergy tried to console the students during the first days of that event and the Leader of Islamic Republic shed tears for them and promised to punish those who attacked the campus. However, during the next few days when the wounded students resumed their classes, none of those promises were kept. Instead, the students were imprisoned and even condemned to death while the invaders suffered no punishment, for they enjoyed the support of the ruling clerics. Since then the Islamic Republic too has a day to worry about the students' protests and unrests.This year, since a few months ago, the students released the information that they intend to accompany the anniversary of the ninth of July with wide spread demonstrations and showed that they can no longer accept the Islamic regime and US authorities supported the students who had stated in their declaration that they are not unaware of the fate of Saddam Hussein and his regime and they are happy with the democracy now established in Iraq. A declaration that provoked anger among the anti-US ecclesiastics. Thus the security and military apparatus started to prepare themselves to go on war with the students. During one of the Friday collective prayers, Hashemi Rafsanjani, the powerful man of the Islamic Republic accused the students of having secret relations with the US and demonstrating on the will of Bush's government. Mohammad Yazdi, the conservative clergy said at the same collective prayer that the demonstrators are belligerents, and in the Islamic legal codes, the belligerent in the sense of one who is an enemy of God should be executed. In this way the ruling clergy tried to intimidate the parents and force them to prevent their children's participations in the demonstrations.But the more effective measure was taken by the pro-government pressure groups who attacked a students' campus in the south of Tehran and wounded hundreds students and when as a protest the students poured out into the streets throughout the country, three thousand heads of the student societies were arrested. Meysam Joulaii who managed to deceive the guards and call his family from the dreadful Evin Prison told them that they would not be released until July 9.The parents of the arrested students in Tehran gathering before the Evin Prison everyday since last week hoping to find some information about their children, at nights tell the runners of the TV satellite programs broadcasted from Los Angeles that they are tired of the Islamic Republic and they expect the world to come to their aid.Ahmad Shirzad, the reformist MP, worried about his son who was arrested and not heard of for two days intended to go on strike by staying in the Tehran University so that his voice would perhaps reach the world, but the dean of the Tehran University who is also a reformist did not allow it. Shirzad was enraged and shouted, "I have lost hope in you Mr. the Dean and I have lost hope in the Minister of the Ministry of Sciences and I have lost hope in the President Khatami and I have lost hope in myself and I just hope people do something."The majority of the Iranian urban citizens share the same feeling and have lost interest in the Islamic Republic, the government that having failed to educate their children the way it wanted now seems unable to forgive their sin in not thinking like the old clergies. There are hundreds of people in the prisons of Iran whose only sin is that after seeing the reformists failing to keep their promises, they lost all hope in the Islamic Republic and seized any opportunity to hold hands and cry harmoniously for the downfall of the government as they did nearly a quarter of century before. In Tehran, there is this belief that every quarter of a century, Iranians succeed to change their government and this is said in reference to the Iranian history in the past century that witnessed the downfall and banishment of four kings and one president.Iranians were the first nation in the Middle East to establish a constitutional government during the first years of the twentieth century. If the clergies had fulfilled their promises, they would have established the first truly republic government in the Middle East. However, after the victory of the revolution, the clergy did not validate their promise and refused to go back to the religious schools and considered the government as theirs and routed out their political rivals and worst of all concentrated all the power in the hands of the leader for as long as he lives. Following these changes introduced to the constitutional law despite the will of the intellectuals and the people, the Leader of the Islamic Republic gained an unprecedented level of power not found anywhere in the world. Domination over the judicial power, having the last voice in the fundamental decisions related to the domestic and foreign policies and exclusive supervision over military and security forces and even the radio and television are among the leader's constitutional powers now. All these changes that transformed the Islamic Republic to a religious despotic ruling system were hidden from the eyes of the ordinary people and it was only the intellectuals and legal experts who protested against such changes and thus were condemned to long terms of imprisonment and death. The situation continued until 1997 when the people elected a reformist clergy as the President, but the whole apparatus under the leader's supervision turned against him. The people nevertheless still endured the circumstances and with their overwhelming participation in the parliamentary elections showed that they truly seek a radical reformation of the ruling religious system. So the followers of the religious leader turned against the Parliament as well and dragged the MPs to the courts and attacked their meetings and shut down the reformist newspapers and arrested the political activists and journalists. That is how the urban middle class reached the point to realize that the religious government is incapable of changing into a democratic system and the clergies in turn realized that in order to maintain their despotic religious rule they have no other alternative than to appeal to coercion and intimidation.During the recent students' demonstrations that the ordinary people joined in immediately, the slogans were all against the religious rule and its life-long leader and the daily propaganda on the national radio and television and the newspapers under the supervision of the leader that called the demonstrators US agents and spies made the ordinary people to fearfully hide in their houses while nobody went to the streets to defend and support the clergies either.Majid the twenty one years old student who has his own web log, writing daily for his young intellectual peers, remarked last week: "Ayatollah Khomeini, the leader of the anti-monarchial revolution said in 1979 that the Shah's regime has demolished the country, but fostered the prisons, but now although they have built hundreds prisons, they still do not have enough room for the four million students that should be arrested. It is now clear who has really fostered the prisons."Mohsen, who is 64 years old, says, if the Islamic Republic had succeeded to fulfill what it had promised, it would have not needed to face any difficulties now and the young people would have supported the clergies as they did in the days of the revolution. However, the clergies who forced three million people to emigrate from Iran were hoping to keep the next generation under their control through the compulsory religious education and propaganda. But it seems that it was just a wishful thinking as the generation born and brought up under their rule and who are now more or less twenty fours years old seem more determined than their fathers in their decision to change the ruling system. In itself, this is a sign of the failure of the religious rulers in educating the young generation in the way they wanted, so now they have no other alternative than to witness their own downfall twenty four years after the days when they enjoyed 97% of the votes. Now even the religious young people are not ready to obey the orders of the clergies who are at the present fixing their eyes upon a bunch of aggressive semi-fascist groups and the one million armed men who have been faithful to them so far in the same way that the republican guards and Baath Party remained faithful to Saddam Hussein.As the political experts anticipate, if the Iranian people manage to overthrow the clergies by their rebels and riots – in the same way that brought about the downfall of Millosovich in Yugoslavia – and a democratic government comes to power in harmony with the world order, the ruling system of Iran would be the second country of George Bush's axis of evil that would fall by the hands of people rather than the military intervention and this will be a greater promise to the ears of the US leaders who had said that after Iraq it is Iran's turn.Even if the extremist clergies – as expressed by the advertising apparatus of the regime – succeed to restrain the coming crisis of July and stay in power, it will still be quite difficult for them to rule a majority who do not like to concede to anything less than their downfall. Addressing President Bush, an Iranian student disguised under the name of 'a pro-globalizationist' has written in his web log "the only language that the ruling clergies know is the language of coercion and they maintain their rule with the aid of this language and that is why as soon as they saw your intimidations, they betrayed Al-Qaedeh and showed willingness to yield to the international laws in regard to the utilization of the nuclear energy and ask to negotiate with you. Their only hope is to see the defeat of the forces led by US in Iraq and their departure from the territories next to the Iranian frontiers. Please do not be defeated, otherwise they will rip our skins."

      Two months after the invasion of Iraq by the Coalition Forces, Iranian opposition groups inside and outside the country overcame their initial astonishment and by revealing cases of violation of Human Rights by Moslem Fundamentalist, they intend to pave the way to democracy, a demand that the ruling fundamentalists and ecclesiastic tend to ignore.Saiid Hajariaan, the theoretician of the reformation movement that started six years ago by election of Mohammad Khatami as the President and winning the majority both in the Parliament and the Cabinet revealed last week that the fundamentalist are using US led military invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq as an excuse to increase their pressure on people and seize back the power from the hands of the Parliament and Cabinet. Hajariaan has said that there is no reason for reformists present in the government to hide the iron fists of the fundamentalists from the world by acting like white gloves.  Hajariaan is one of the ex-leaders of the secret service of Islamic Republic. Three years ago he miraculously escaped assassination plotted by the extremist clergies, nevertheless as the result of the brain injury incurred by the bullet shot he has been hemiplegia living on the wheelchair ever since. Just before this fatal attempt on his life, Hajariaan acting also as one of President Khatami’s advisors was publishing a newspaper disclosing financial corruption among ruling clergies and their role in murders carried out inside and outside the country.In an interview with the only remaining reformist newspaper last week Saiid Hajariaan said that so far the reformist have shown a great deal of patience and have endured the fundamentalists' pressure in order not to give any excuse to Americans, but our totalitarian rulers with the fanciful excuse of the presence of a hidden enemy behind the frontiers are exercising a harsh dictatorship in the country.The reformists inside and outside the country hoped that president Khatami's election would force the fundamentalist clergies to yield to democratic changes and concede at least a part of power to the people. Since the very first day after September 11, the followers of gradual and peaceful reformation have been under great pressures exercised by the fundamentalists who with the support of Ayatollah Khamenei, the life long leader of Islamic Republic having all the major powers in his hand, have obstructed the way of reformation to the extent that in the last election of February 28, the overwhelming majority of people showed that they will not be satisfied with anything less than a total shift of power.  Refusal of 85% of people to participate in the election of city councils occurred when the reformists had already warned the rulers against the danger of loss of hope among people, but not only the fundamentalists did not pay any attention to these warnings, but referring to the US threats expressed against Iran after the fall of Baghdad's regime, the religious leaders asked people and reformists to stay quite and get mobilized against these threats and by participating in demonstrations await the fall of American Imperialism. The fall of America and spread of Islamic revolution throughout the world is a promise that the clergies keep on assuring people in Friday Prayers and consider it as one of the promises of Koran, the Holy Book of Moslems.But these are slogans that are only used to keep people quite, for in their negotiations with European and American authorities behind the closed doors, they emphasize on their readiness to surrender to the new world order and refer to their position in regard to the establishment of Us led governments in Afghanistan and Iraq as an evidence and promise not to hinder the establishment of peace in the Middle East and the international struggle against terrorism in the future. The positive reaction of European and American authorities to the growing flexibility of Iranian government in its foreign policy is encouraging the fundamentalist to continue the suppression of the students, journalists, lawyers and liberalist groups and by simultaneous increase of pressures, they do their best to keep the world ignorant of the internal events.The closing down of 82 newspapers, issuing of long term sentences for political activists and even reformist MPs and journalists, foundation of semi-fascist groups to attack parties and newspapers and student gatherings are among the activities that the fundamentalists carry out in order to maintain their sovereignty and to minimize the possible consequences of events going on around Iranian frontiers. This very policy is making political reformist groups to prepare themselves for a collective resignation and leaving the government.  During the last three years, and under the cover of an approved parliamentary bill in relation to possession of satellite dish, the military agents of the government have forced 400000 people to pay fines, sometimes as high as $100000, while confiscating their systems as well. Fed up with the tedious propaganda of Islamic TV, the middle class looks at the satellite programs as a mean to learn about what is really going on around the world by watching BBC and CNN channels and the youth who make up the majority of the present population watch MTV and films and programs never shown on the Islamic TV. During the outbreak of war in Iraq the demand for satellite dishes increased and in Tehran it was sold twice as high as its normal price, for people had realized that the national radio and TV only broadcast Iraqi and Aljazeereh censored news with commentaries on resistant of Iraqi people. And they continued to behave that way up to two days after the fall of Saddam and disappearance of Saiid Alsahaf.In addition, while the government agents were busy to prevent people from watching satellite programs, Iranian youth were busy opening their own sites and web logs disseminating the news of fundamentalist attacks on the universities and lecture halls. Suddenly the internet users quadrupled. And it was here that under the pretension of “protection of security and morals of the society,” the leader of Islamic Republic ordered the government to use filters for 110000 internet sites to prevent access to real information. Once it was revealed that the communication system of Iran is not equipped with the required technology for this purpose, the secret service pompously began to arrest young people who wrote daily in their web logs and by throwing them into dark solitary cells they created an atmosphere of terror to make other young people to close down their web logs at least until the government manages to buy the necessary equipment - costing over 10 million dollars – that would make access to political and sex sites impossible for Iranians.While this mortal struggle is going on between the fundamentalists and people particularly the youth, monarchists and followers of Mojahedin Khalgh – the armed opposition force enjoying military bases in Iraq, but forced to hand in their arms after the occupation of Iraq – have been asking people to demonstrate in street, promising them that if they rebel the people of the world will not leave them alone. So far their request has been ignored by the youth who perhaps still hope that the clergy and fundamentalists would yield to peaceful and non-violent changes.Another part of the four million people forced to immigrate in the past 24 years have recently published a statement called ‘Manifesto of Republicans’ in which they have asked people to insist on a referendum by the means of demonstrations, strikes, civilized non-violent resistance, violation of orders in order to spare themselves from living under the rule of a religious government. Despite all the dangers that publication of such a manifest could bring about, the above manifest was rapidly copied and disseminated in student campuses and posted on nameless news sites as it not only suggests another alternative, but tries to spare Iran from foreign military invasion. In the Manifesto of Republicans it is said that the fundamentalist clergies are driving the country toward a dangerous abyss, similar to that which Saddam drove Iraqi people to, that is to watch American tanks and trucks, through their home windows, passing their streets.These days the reformists and conservatives are referring to the present period as the time of the ‘stillness before tempest,’ while the fundamentalists are still opposing people violently. By writing letters to the leader of Islamic Republic, the reformists try to make it clear that the danger threatening the government should not be neglected and the internal state is rapidly moving toward militarization.  By arresting those who had written such letters to Ayatollah Khamenei, the fundamentalists tried to block this way of information dissemination as well, but the publication of Amir Farshad Ebrahimi’s letter startled every one. Ebrahimi used to work for fascist fundamentalist groups who attacked women and students and cinemas and had killed a number of intellectuals. He was sentenced after disclosing the secrets of these pressure groups and their connection to the clergies and the secret service in the office of an attorney and spent a year in prison. Last week he received a letter from a terrorist group informing him that the religious order for his murder has been issued and his body will soon be found in the streets.In a shocking letter to President, Amir Farshad Ebrahimi has written that people have grown tired of the President’s intellectual poses and his beautiful philosophical words and they have lost hope in the President with his photochromic glasses. “It is quite possible that by the time you receive this letter I am already dead, but you would still be sitting idle.” This 27 years old young man is one of the 21 million Iranian who were hoping to liberate the country from religious despotism by electing a clergy who claimed to believe in civil society and democracy, but as Saiid Hajariaan has said, not only what people hoped was not realized, but Mohammad Khatami and his reformist followers turned into ‘velvet white gloves’ hiding the iron fists holding the last signs of Islamic fundamentalism after Bin Laden and Taliban, continuing their ruler through showing flexibility in regard to foreign policy and violence in relation to people.
