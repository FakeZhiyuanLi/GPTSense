      I slept and rested the whole day. Hun stayed and played Front Mission 4 on my PS2. I tried to make my speakers work in the afternoon but apparently there's some prob with the software which I can't grasp. Hun and I didn't take a bath! Hahahaha!

       It was so fun today! Buddy, Ced, Hunny and I hanged out together at Buddy's house. We laughed, told funny stories and talked about pRO. Buds and I also reminisced our days in highschool and looked at our old pictures. I really enjoyed being with them coz it was so refreshing! It's as if we're back to our good old days in La Co. Ãœ   Hun and I got here at home just now... I'm so sleepy already but I've got to install Sakray in my PC and I feeeeeeel the urge to plaaaaayyyyy... And that's what I'm gonna do right now. Hehehehe! Oh my. As Ms. Pau once told me.. "Once an addict, always an addict.." Hoo well, that's me! Hehehehe! Sakray here I come!! XD

      It's amusing how I, at this age, realize that as an adult I should be responsible for every little thing I do. I guess I did so a little later than I should. I realized the hard way that every single positive thing I do has its benefits, the same way every single wrongdoing has its consequences. I guess I'm either stubborn or stupid or hard-headed, learning these as if I've just turned 18.   At this age, I miss classes then catch up in a panic; I play pRO instead of concentrating on my studies. The next two months are the most critical in my life because what will happen within this span of time will decide what kind of life I will be leading in the future-- if I fail my subjects I get dismissed from UP and become a college dropout; if I succeed I can go on pursuing my dreams of getting into law school. So what would it be? Sometimes the wiser decisions are the ones we overlook because of lethargy and apathy. I'm just tired of being too lethargic I delay living life as I should.   So again the question goes.. "What would it be?" If you were asked this question, which would you choose? Ah, the irony of choosing the better answer over the one preferred. I just want to play pRO but I mustn't! I guess I should concentrate on school, and finish the last 18 units of my undergraduate years. I guess I'll just have to keep in mind how nice it would be to finally finish school after all these years.. and how I can finally play pRO 24/7 once I graduate from college. Oooo yeah.. =D  [What I did today: Before going to class, I was at Hun's place. We ate noodles at the clubhouse then I went to UP na. I went home early. Miss ko na si Hun sobra...]

      I woke up at 11 a.m. today and I was feeling lazy. I felt like having a break after all the things that happened the past three weeks! I need it, but there are other tasks that need to be done. At 2:30 p.m. I went to my boarding house and packed up all the unnecessary stuff I can bring home coz I'll be moving out next month. I was delayed for about two hours because of the hard rain and I arrived home at around 6. I didn't take a break, I went on arranging all my stuff in my room. Hunny called at around 9, then my brother asked me to fetch him at his office in Makati at 11. Now I'm here. I'm bored. I'll just go play RO..

       I've been so afraid that Hun'd be sick with dengue, but fortunately he wasn't! I was so nervous coz I thought it was something serious, buti na lang hindi... I already miss him so much, I wanna drop by their place just to see how he is pero sabi naman niya he's ok na. Gusto kong puntahan siya but I gotta be crammed inside my room studying all that I missed in class. Hayyy.   Well I've been keeping up with my missed classes. It's a good thing my profs gave me makeup work for the things I missed. I guess I won't be playing pRO for awhile. Two months lang naman walang pRO eh, at least I'm gonna graduate once and for all. I swear even if it's Juno I won't ever ever ever topup. Ang mantra: "Buhay o RO?" Shempre buhay noh.. kasi kung patay na 'ko ndi na 'ko makakalaro ng Ragnarok. Hehehehe whatever!!

       I was with Hun in the morning at the Infirmary for a short while because I had a class at 10. His mom and dad were also there. He was negative to dengue and I was very, very happy! I rode a jeep back to Vinzon's to attend my 10 o' clock class, and on my way I bumped into Ernest. He's forever complaining about the thesis proposal he seemed to never do. Sigh. When we came into the Main Lib, we bumped into Bjorn. I was glad to see him after a long time! We chatted a while then I went up to my class. Felvs, Jesamine and I fooled around the PCs while we ate Lala [that homemade chocolate]. Hehehe.    I sat in Ernest's LIS 64 class and did my interview plan for later. I was feeling very nervous about the interview I have to do for my Comm 3 class in the afternoon. My hands were all clammy and I was shaking a little. After the class I bumped into Emong at the covered walk and talked about completing our inc's together. I don't have much of an appetite that noon so I just bought a large Four Seasons at the CASAA. I took it to my CL 151 class, which was boring as usual.   I encoded my interview plan at the CSSP computer lab after class and it was there where JPaul met up with me. We went to my Comm 3 class and I kind of chickened out. He was dragging me out of the room next to my class where we sort of stayed. At around 4, my professor talked to me and asked me to do a taped interview instead, but with a little extra. I called up Hun at home to 'report.' ^^   I went around with JPaul yesterday, catching up with things inside a little hut in front of the FC. I promised to treat him kasi if he agreed to the interview so I treated him to Chibox and a movie [we watched Imelda at SM Megamall, which was quite something to see]. But before we watched Imelda, we dropped by Mike's house. We texted and called him and all but he didn't even have the decency to show up. Fine, we gatecrashed his place but he should've at least talked to us personally about leaving him alone. His mom was pretty rude to us on the phone. I don't know what we did to him as his closest friends of 8 years to deserve that kind of treatment. I was embarrassed and angry. JPaul and I waited an hour for him to come out but he didn't. We thought maybe he really changed all the while we didn't keep in touch. Or maybe his girlfriend Aiza forbade him to see us. I know SHE's got a problem with ME, she better settle the score with me IN MY FACE coz I abhor goddamn backstabbers. God, I feel so pissed. Mike seems to have given up our friendship for some bitch I introduced to him. He better learn a lesson from what he did to us today. Better yet, I WILL give his girlfriend a lesson she'll never forget, if I get to prove that she's been behind all these injury to my and JPaul's pride.   So we watched the movie and I didn't expect it to have that kind of impact on me. Imelda Marcos was pretty funny and naive in the movie. I don't know what to feel about her. We went home at around 12 a.m. and I rode an FX home with a bad headache, the same I usually get after attending my Polsci 14 classes several sems ago.

      When we left home Hun was well na, pero when we commuted to U.P. he suddenly became very sick all of a sudden. I accompanied him to NISMED where he was to meet his mom then I went to my LIS 141 class. After that I bumped into Rovik [a.k.a. azrael at the ragnaboards] on the way out and talked about issues at the Ragnaboards. I came to my English 30 class late and my professor said, "Charmaine... if she's not absent, she's late.." I just smiled and chuckled at my classmates. ^^   At around 1 p.m. I came back to NISMED and saw that he really was very sick. I convinced him to come with me to the Infirmary. His mom came with us. They got his blood count and asked us to come back tomorrow for the results. His mom went back to work and we took a cab home to Northview. My poor Hun isn't feeling any better at all. I was really very worried because his doctor told us he might be sick with dengue. I cleaned up his room while he slept.   At around 7 p.m. I was about to leave for Pasig when his dad and mom came home. His dad offered to take me to Philcoa, where I may be able to properly get a ride home. I called him up as soon as I got home and didn't sleep well because I was very worried about him. My mom stopped me from going back to his place, telling me that he needed rest for now. I felt resigned to the situation and went to sleep.

      Hun's got a high fever which was on and off--one minute he's well then sick in the next. I was a bit alarmed, but I kept his temperature down by giving him sponge baths. We watched TV together all day. I sort of studied while I kept an eye on him until he fell asleep.
