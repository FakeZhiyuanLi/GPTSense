      Last night I had a really bad dream.  It seemed so real; I literally was crying when I woke up!  I was in this wierd house, old style, and me and people I have never seen before, but in the dream I was very familar to, were hiding from strange persons.  It was scary.  The "bad guys" were going to test bug chemicals(funny but not) on us, if they found us.  We hid in an attic type place.  Spiderwebs and all.  It was so real.  I was hiding for my life.  We saw them catch Family and friends.  I told them that I thought that if I showed myself, then it would give everyone else I chance to escape.  This all sounds funny, but it wasnt.  It really made me think about my freedom!  I NEVER have to worry about dieing or someone comeing after me!  And I dont have to hide from anything!  Ever!  So I guess I just wanted to tell everyone out there that I am very thankful that I am free!  AMEN!

       So today was registration at school. I saw a lot of the people that I haven't seen in months. We talked, it was fine. I talked to someone last night though that was a really good friend, but when we talked it was weird, like we didnt really want to be talking to each other. So pray for me about that. I wasnt in the best of moods so that might be it. My schedule is pretty good, most of the people that I have talked to have 4th lunch, so do I, so thats good. Art is right after lunch, so that will be a breeze!  Me and my parents got to sit down last night a talk. We came to a half way agreement, but I still think they were wrong about most of the agrument.  Yesterday I had an amazing quiet time. I was really in depth, it took me about an hour and twenty minutes. But it was real good. I had to finish up the day befores and that days. It was just about God love and mercy and it kinda touched on grace. The main thing that was on grace that kinda review of the last weeks. There was this big long thing on grace, but here was my favorite part: Things Which Gracious Souls Discover 1. To  " hope to be better "  is to fail to see yourself  in Christ only . 2. To be  disappointed  with yourself, is to have  believed  in yourself. 3. To be  discouraged  is  unbelief --as to God's purpose and plan of blessing for you. 4. To be  proud , is to be  blind ! For we have no standing beofre God, in  oursleves . 5. The lack of Divine blessing, therefore, somes from  belief , and not from  failure of devotion . 6. Real  devotion  to God arises, not from  man's will  to show it; but from the discovery that blessing  has been recieved  from God while we were yet  unworthy and undevoted . 7. To preach devotion first, and blessing second, is to reverse God's order, and preach  law, not grace . The Law made man's blessing depend on devotion; Grace  confers undeserved, unconditional  blessing: our devotion may follow, but does not always do so, in proper measure. Most of that is hard for me to understand and comprehend, but after I thought about it for awile I caught on to the majority of it. There are many other awesome things God has shown me through this Bible study Ive been doing. I have to thank Gloria for reminding me that I need to do it, I started it at the end of the year and then just kinda stopped cause I "lost interest" but it is soo good, and Im glad that she got onto me! There other quotes that I may tell you later, but I think for tonight Im going to call it quits. Love you all, my two adoring fans! nighty night! Oh, also something to pray for, it seems like lately I've been wanting and wanting stuff, and my parents have inportant things that they are paying for like the car getting fixed and the house getting fixed; money just seems tight lately and it doesnt help that I want a few new things.  So just pray for that, im not sure if I should be less wanting or that money should come more abundantly; maybe a little of both.   Psalm 90:14    Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.

       Last night at youth Krystle gave the youth a time of prayer without any of the college or adult leaders. It's hard to look at the youth in that perspective, but that really is what our youth is, everyone else are just leaders. The whole summer I spent most of my time with these college leaders and I grew so much, but to really put into effect everything God has taught me, I have to do it on my own. With God as my strength yes, but when I say own my own, I mean without the older influence right there with me.   In our time of prayer I really tried to reach out to some of the younger youth, especially the girls. Mallory is a senior and after this year she will be just another college student that is my awesome summer influence. I went and prayed with Ericka and Christine(sp). They are the girls I really think I should get close to as time goes on. I have always had someone to look up to during the school year, Mallory and Reilly. They are only one and two years older than me so I can really relate to the stuff they go through. When Mallory leaves these younger girls will become part of the high school youth and so they wont have her like I have. So I feel like I need to be that leader for them. If that makes any sense at all. It does to me.   My parents and I are fighting, once again. They think that haveing college students as best friends is a bad influence or w/e. I just dont see that. If anything would be a bad influence they would be the LAST thing! It's just hard being so different from my parents. They dont really see what I think is right or the dont want to see. And my brother just adds to the frustration. This is when the servant part gets tricky for me. I try to serve them and do exactly what they want, but I cant b/c some times what they want goes against what I believe, but I wanted to Honor My Mother and Father. Grr its frustrating. I dont want to go into detail so Ill leave it as that.   1 Timothy 4   12Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity.

        Today is the last Chance I get to hang out with Krystle and Jeremiah(Chili Pepper Popper, say that five times fast!) Im about to go play ultimate with the for the last time probably until next year or so. But this has been an awesome summer, and I cant wait till the next one! school is starting soon, Barf! I cant believe how fast this summer went by. I went to Gag days last night, it was boring, but fun. I caught up with a bunch of my friends that I havent talked to in months. It was kinda akward not knowing anything about their summers, but it was ok. I got to tell everyone what awesome things God has allowed me to do this summer. I think I really accomplished alot this summer, God provided my first really hard core job. I stayed a week with Keturahs grandma, which was awesome. I rode the Legend, thanks to Reilly Makeing me do it. I spent a week with my youth in Chicago ministring to Edgewater Baptist Church, awesome! Although I think I was ministred to rather than me ministring to them. My churches worship service is good, but I was blow away by the spirit during their service. God was totally the center of their service. Nothing was for their glory, and you could really see that in them. It was awesome, so I guess I just wanted to say what all I did this summer... umm a good verse to keep in mind is: Relvalation 2:3 You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name, and have not grown weary. I dont think that really applies but I like that verse.

        God has revealed to me so many things this summer. 1) To be humble. This is the most heart-felt one just b/c I need it so much. That I should consider everyone above myself. I think I have trouble with that. Even when someone is younger or w/e I think of myself better than them for some reason. 2) To Always be a servant. This one started at the beginning of summer and I still am being reminded of it. For me its kinda going hand in hand with the humbleness one. Even the simplest things that I should do for other people, like turn on a light, I feel like I should get repaid for it or I just get too lazy to do the dumbest things like that. But God is showing me that people in so many places don't even have things like lights to turn on, so why should I be so stupid and selfish to not even turn on a light. 3) To be truly and honestly thankful for what I have. So many kids and families have NOTHING and I complain day to day about not having anything or w/E. How Selfish! And to be thankful for a family who might not always see eye to eye, but for a family that loves each other and cares about each other. Some kids are totally ignored all day and some kids parents hurt them emotionally, physically or verbally and I am so thankful that my parents don't do that to me day in and day out. 4) That how much time do I really spend time with Him. Yes I do my quiet time and so on, but do I really spend time with God building a relationship. My youth talked about this at Mfuge, it was one of the evening topics, about how when we make a new friend we want to spend time with them and learn about them and what their qualities are, but how often do I do the same thing with God. He loves me more than any other human on the whole planet, I can't even comprehend God definition of Love, and yet I spend more time with the tv or with a earthly friend. 5) Meditation and Fasting are important to our foundation of Christianity. Krystle talked about this last night at youth. It's really cool that meditation was taught b/c throughout the summer I just have spent hours on my front lawn thinking about God and how awesome he must be to think up things like a cloud or rain, just simple everyday things. And also that Fasting doesn't have to be not eating food, it could be something like not watching tv for so many days or /we. 6) To have the heart of a child. Today I was working with little kids and they were putting together a puzzle and one of the pieces was the outline of a little child kneeling and praying and it hit me that children are the most precious things in the world, even through their bad behavior and so on, they were made by God and they will believe anything. They are so trusting and willing. 7) That our lives should mean fruitful labor for Christ. In everything we do it should be for Christ. EVERYTHING we do should glorify God, and to take it a step further its not us even doing the good work, its God doing it through us. WE GET NO GLORY, GOD GETS IT ALL!  Well that pretty much it, lol. God has taught me so much and I am so thankful of the youth I have. Its weird to just call them that, youth, b/c most of them are so much more than just my "youth" they are my guidance and best friends. lol Tearjerker! But really they are. ...Oh heavens...  Here's just a chapter about God's glory. Psalm 19 1 The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands. 2 Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they display knowledge. 3 There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard. 4 Their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens he has pitched a tent for the sun, 5 which is like a bridegroom coming forth from his pavilion, like a champion rejoicing to run his course. 6 It rises at one end of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other; nothing is hidden from its heat. 7 The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul. The statutes of the LORD are trustworthy, making wise the simple. 8 The precepts of the LORD are right, giving joy to the heart. The commands of the LORD are radiant, giving light to the eyes. 9 The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring forever. The ordinances of the LORD are sure and altogether righteous. 10 They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb. 11 By them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward. 12 Who can discern his errors? Forgive my hidden faults. 13 Keep your servant also from willful sins; may they not rule over me. Then will I be blameless, innocent of great transgression. 14 May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.
