      Well in all the clouds.. I could sit here and bitch about all the things are pissing me off, Oh My.. not a good idea... I am going to look at the which I see peaking out between the clouds.    I talked to Kaylee (bum ice) today...I'll bring you a t-shirt from John Mayer... big shouts to her and her crew in the 5-1-9.    My soulmate has found his own soulmate.. and I am shocked to realize that it doesn't hurt as bad at I thought it would.  But that may be the lack of alcohol in my system talking.....  I feel old..... maybe that's because my good friends here are all like 17.... but it's cool with me.  It's the parents I have to worry about.... hee hee      Um..... that's about it..... I am doing alright.. I am bored.... but dinner is almost ready... mmmmm.... smells soooo good!  So yeah.... man I am Lame! See y'all later!  Listening to: the shower going, Mandy Moore Thinking about: a certain someone Missing: SNOW!

      What can I say Josh is hot.... my Josh, not your Josh!  Danielle's party was a lot of fun, as I knew it would be! When you have your birthday party, those you say are gonna make it and don't.... and those who show up, it really, in my opinion, shows who your friends are. But we had fun, got some really cool picutres to PROVE IT!!! Cause I bring the camera and take pictures of everyone! (Alex has a nice ass!...... NOTHING HAPPENED!) But yes you guys missed out on a really good party.... so HA HA at you! (T. you are a jerk!)

      Today is the last day of class until the NEW YEAR!!!!!   Um.... Last night was a bore... I had to work till 10, then I went home and sat (like a bum) infront of my computer and talked to my friends back home on msn, with MY WEB CAM!!!! Yeah it wasn't bad, kinda fun to be honest.   I got my grad photos yesterday... they aren't bad..... I actually look like I can smile.. not like a total retard!  So I am happy with them.  Plus the one of Me and Danielle..... looks like I have 3 cheeks and that she is trying to bite my head off! SOOO FUNNY!  I got to upload the photos of Miles and Tai and Ryan last night cause my computer works again.... So I know have more photos of hot guys on my computer! It's cool!  Tomorrow night is Danielle's birthday party.... We are going to be lame.... and PLAY SPIN THE BOTTLE!  Yeah I know you are jealous!  I figure it is the only way I may actually get some action this month!  Unlike Danielle..... but she won't spill any details... but her blushings are enough  Well that is all... make sure you check back over the holidays for NEWS.....  OH and Check out the UNLABELED link for more exciting news!  Loves xoxo

      WE went bowling and it was fun, just me, Tracey and Danielle. I tripped on the step and sorta.... well fell on my face! (and had this hot guy laugh at me!)  The guys sorta stood us up... but oh well what can you do? ( I don't like boys now... not just because of them, but plus Tate called today... and that was weird, really weird...) So we went bowling.. then to Tim Hortons where there seem to be an overly large group gathering... and the guy weren't that bad.. well some of them were really scary... but the one in the tie was quite hot! So the guys were gonna come hang out after... but waiting 10 minutes has turned into an hour and we now no longer care. So I am going to eat pizza with Danielle and watch the O.C. cause I am LAME and have nothing better to do. Well I have to work tomorrow so I will not be doing anything nearly as exciting as I did tongiht..... Lucky me.  Hey Maybe Tate will call me tomorrow and stand me up like he always does... or just be honry... and that won't be cool either... so yeah I am now in a bad mood, and going to watch Seth and Ryan to make myself in a better mood.  Good night y'all

Anyways, as to bowling tonight, tempting offer, but I'm gonna have to see if I can go before I say anything...ooh that reminds me I'm gonna email Brian now to get him to come. LATER DAYS!

      As the title would say, LAME is what last night was.  We went to Courtney's to watch videos... which turn out to be us watching Ferris Bueller.... and sitting there with barely any talking..... so the fact that it was 3 guys and 3 girls... and we were all sitting on seperate couches/chairs... with the expection of 3.... (2 guys and a girl - AWKWARD!) it was weird! So yeah, I wish I had of been hammered, the night might have been more bareable.... The only fun thing of the evening was Tai and Ryan's MAGIC TRICK... and the photos.... photos of hot guys.....*droooling* haha!  Courtney, hunny, I love you, but you had the chance last night to KNOCK HIS SOCKS OFF, and you barely said 3 words to him... or to anyone for that matter.... what was up?  I talked to Tai last night on msn... and even though he doesn't look at me int he girlfriend light he thinks I am cool, and wants us to be friends... tight and stuff.... So I am cool with that.  (Plus I'll just change the lightbulb..... lol) So as we sit in our "SPARE" the guys are probably sleeping.. or getting ready to go see LOTR... lucky bastards!  But it's all about the fun bolwing tonight.  Plus the camera... photos of hot guy bums, as they bowl.... (right Danielle?) This should be less lame! I hope cause I can't take anymore lame nights..... it will kill me!     LATER MUCH

      Nat...hunny. You are so awsome. Remember we will always be there to lend an ear if needed, and that we love you soo much.  I feel the same way about tripping on the stage at grad, I fear that I have had for years! But it's ok, we'll trip together!  Hey do you remember the time we went to McDonalds and Allan said that him and Jenn were "fornicating" on the prep table? What a wierd night, but an awsome one none the less. You rock at drivin!  And yes...your birthday...haha it is going to be sweeeet. Oh...darling...I am so wanting to be 18 again, as long as the night turns out like it did last time!!!

      Today is a new day, and even though it is raining, there will be sun amongst the clouds!  Well my life is taking some turns that I am not sure where they will take me, but I will fight... and keep on fighting until I have succeed in getting what I want.  I won't be brought down... so don't even try.  Schhol is a conguest I shall over come. I am soo close to the finish line now I can taste it.  I have wanted to throw in the towel, put my hands in the air and scream I GIVE UP, but yet I am still here, sitting in class, still fighting for the finish. And when I walk across that stage at graudation, with my friends and family watching I shall hold my head up high and be proud of who I am and who I have become! ( And pray I don't trip!) I cannot wait!   Work is going great and I love it.  I am so lucky to have a job I love and work with a great bunch of people.  I just hope that upon my return to Ontario (In July) I can transfer to a Booltegger there. I hope I hope I hope!  I want to say thanks to Courntey and Jenn for last night.. when I had my little break down... I want to say thanks for being so supportive and listening so well. It makes me realize what great friends I have here, at it helps me miss the ones I have back home a little bit less. (Hey Courtney... remember that time Jenn fell on her ass in Tim Horton's and they hot guy with the side burns laughed at her...)  Tonight shall be fun.... beer plus chiilin... always a good time! Let's make it happen LADIES!  I have realized when it comes to the males species... or GUYS in general, I am meant to be without one of my own for now.. It hurts and i still feel lonely, but I don't need a guy to be happy.  I mean yeah, getting some lovin' helps to put a smile upon my face... But I do not require it to be happy.  Plus when I finally do find my Prince and we walk down the red carpet of happiness, so many people will be jealous, and then I will have won the fight. So I may be cute, and guys may try and be with me for the wrong reasons, and I may be frightening to others... But I no longer care!  My 19 birthday is in 9 days, LET THE FUN BEGIN... and the drunkeness!  I can't wait.  My birthday has changed.  WE are going to see INK's show at Cyber City.  There might be a gathering at my house before for food, and cake, and possilby afterwards.... but we are going to see Ink's show!!! Hey Courntey.... feeling 18 again?? ha ha  Well darlings, I am out....  LATER MUCH!!!

On a way better note, I watched part of the Coldplay Live 2003 DVD tonight(Nat I love you for getting me it!) and I almost cried, hhahah! It brought back so many memories....2005 fer sure!!!! I also watched The Emperor's New Groove and laughed my bloody ass off, that is so the best movie EVER. Nat's was fun tonight, other then the fact that SOMEONE didn't go, hahahah. Oh well, we had a blast. Anyways dahhlings, I am bagged and wanna get offline before that gross guy( you know who) starts talking to me. *GAGS* too late. Byeee!

      I am so sick of people acting like they are f***ing 5 when they are 17.  If you have something to say to me, just say it to my face and not behind my back as I walk away.    Work today was long and seemed never ending.  School was okay I guess... I passed my Geography mid-term... GO ME!!!!!  Boys are soooo damn confusing! If you have a girlfriend, or don't want one... please don't lead us on to believing you wanna be with us.  It's aggravating! And it pisses us off.  Well that is it, I am going to bed now as I am tired as hell, and pissed off with how this day went.  Maybe I just need sleep, then some hump and then more sleep.... where is that HOT GUY when I need him?

      Well tonight had the potential to turn into on of those mornings where I wake up and wonder what the hell (or who the hell) I did last night.  But luckily for me when I wake up tomorrow I will not have to question the strange looking individual beside me becasue THERE WON'T BE ONE!  Movies at Danielle's.  We eneded up in HOME HARDWARE!! Well that was interesting to say the least.  But the guy with the hair.... not bad, not bad at all. I could be partying with Andy right now, but no, I am saving my liver and my kidneys (that's a crock of shit, in 20 days they're fucked and they don't even know it yet!) WELL, I didn't talk to the one guy I wanted to talk too tonight so now I am taking my cute ass to meet Courtney so we can go to Timmy's.... No I now take that back.... she is NOT going for a walk.  Oh well, now I am still here, in front of my computer!   So yeah I wish I had something intelligent to say... but I don't.... I am a DUMBASS.  WEll I guess I am off to bed now... cause I do have to work tomorrow... JOHN MAYER FEBRUARY 12TH!!!!   Peace out.... SUCK MY DICK BITCH!!!  Natter

Well me and the girls had a good chuckle over that cause he ahd NO idea what we were laughing at, but he then didn't realize that it was a good thing either.... Boys, silly pets!

      Is loving your ex-boyfriend wrong?  Especially when you now you like someone else... who you think likes you back, but are not sure what is going to happen between you too. And you know the ex-boyfriend, if you were in the town, things may be different between you two, he may still care about you.  Boys are so damn confusing, and to be bloody honest I just don't want to be by myself anymore.  You know, I just want a last call of the day, someone who will love me and think I look beautiful even first thing in the morning.  Why does that appear to be sooo hard to find?  (Don't get me wrong... kissing in my laundry room is SOOO much fun!)  But boys are strange, and I am still trying to figure out why they do the things they do.  My birthday is in 21 days, I feel like I am getting old. Ok I know 19 is not old, but it is when you go to school with a bunch of 16 year olds.  Some of these I have made friends with, and I wouldn't get rid of them for the world!  But I still feel old!  Why does HE have to be in onatrio and not here with me?  Cause I am here with out you baby, but your still on my lonely mind....  My cousin/ best friend TJ is doing sooo well I am sooo proud of her, I just wish I could be there with her..... But I am a recovering NUT CASE!!! I think I am doing quite well.  School, work, a life for once! I want to learn how to play a cool instrument, but I have NO musical talent.... can I possilbe work around that?  I like cowboys and cowboy hats... so my next journey is...... TEXAS!!! I am going to go there!  Well the bell just rang.. this hell of a class is over!

Let's see, what's new in my old boring life? Um.... exams are done! My geography one was BAD! It was really bad.  I think I did alright, but it was the same crap over and over again!  Oh well!  I am sad my classes are over.  No more note passing in biology, no more foot touching in geography... sad sad!  I talked to my dad, and I cried, but hey, I always cry. But now he understands me a little bit better.  Oh and once again I am the BAD INFLUENCE.  I, apparently, am to blame for Danielle's changing.  You know what, FUCK THAT! She was changing long before I got here, you just don't like it and need a scapgoat.  Well feel free to blame it on me, I do NOT care, nor do I believe you.  Stop worrying about everyone else and live your own fucking life! And if you have something to say.... about me......... GET SOME FUCKING BALLS and say it to me!  UNLABELED is playing at Wellington on Wednesday February 18th! Gonna be a kick ass show!

      So it is done! I worked and worked... and I think I finally love it! I have to get the comments put back in.. but that takes time and effort.  Plus Danielle's help! So they will be back soon! If there are lyrics... or links to cool bands you would like to see on here, e-mail them to me: islandprincess19@hotmail.com  Today is my wonderful DAY OFF! No school, no work, just sit around and do nothing if I want to.  It's nice... well it has the potential to be nice. So far it is shit.  I woke up to my aunt and uncle fighting about everything for here to the moon.  The worse part of that? He used me as fucking a way to gain ground in a fight and refered to me and my rommate as dumb and dumber.  I ahte that. I used to be called that a kid. I am soo pissed off right now it is not even funny. Then to top it off, I called my dad, thinking he will be able to spare a couple minutes to talk to me and make me feel better.  Nope he said all of 3 words to me and when I asked him to pay attention to me he said "It's kinda hard, I'm playing with the boy" Thanks a lot dad. Good to know that you have time for me in all of this. I called to tell you I got my prom dress and that I am really excited and you can't even take 2 fucking minutes out fo your day to talk to me? HOLY FUCK, I am 5000km away... He pisses me off! And my step mom doesn't sound like she gives 2 shits about me when I call. Her voice always sounds like.."oh you again" This is what I am going back too? Why am I so excited to go back? I'm not really that crazy about the idea anymore. I mean I wanna see my family, and all my friends, but what about after a week when I am miserable? Cause I know it will happen? Then what? That's when I leave and go to Europe.  That is what I am excited for!  I hope my family understands that I am leaving them again.   On to Happier things:  ROB IS SINGLE!  Yes, Ladies and Gents, it's true. He and Jen and no longer together. I am sooo pumped! But I am not getting overly excited. I mean I will not be back there for 5 more months. So I have to wait and see!  HE'S GONNA WANT ME!

      SUNDAY night: we went to see Win a Date with Tad Hamilton.. it was cute... predictable.. but cute.  As our movie ended and we went to wait for Danielle's mom, Courtney ran into her friend Dylan.. who happens to be quite hot!  Things got really awkward after a couple minutes of talking.. so me and Danielle left Courtney standing there.  Then we all went outside into the cold night air.  Decided we wanted to see the hottness again and went inside where it was warm. We were sitting at the table with them and I looked at Dylan and if I were asking him to pass the napkins I asked him if we could see under his clothes! The best part was HE SHOWED US! Nice nipple ring he has! I wanted to touch it! hee hee  MONDAY: well I got up EARLY to write my biology provincial.  I think I did alright on it.  We went to Tim Hortons with Jenn and her sister and made fun of Josh for like 20 minutes! It was sooo funny! I don't think I have laughed that hard since me and Courtney laughed about our porn videos were "are" gonna make! hahaha Then my aunt and I went to look for prom dresses.... I FOUND IT!!!! I got one!!!! I LOVE IT! it's blue and black, and I look thin and soo nice in it!! I LOVE IT!!! Thanks soooo much Auntie Alison.  Well it's Monday.... I have to clean the bathroom.. and then I am going for a walk with Courtney... I'll write tomorrow.. on my very much enjoyable DAY OFF!!!

      So it's been a couple days, but nothing overly exciting has happened.    On FRIDAY after school we went to victoria, went to the movies, and then we drove home....  I had to pee sooo bad so we stopped in at the Ladysmith MacDonalds and... GOT MORE DRINKS! But it was fun! Jenn is a crazy driver.. I swear I see my whole life flash before my eyes at least once everytime I get in that car with her! So we stopped in at the All School's Dance.... of course we didn't go.. no tickets and WE ARE TOO OLD! We tehn went to MacDonald's..... again! For free food!  Then we all were tired... and Jenn decided she was going to go into work to help.  On SATURDAY I had to work at 2:30 till 6:30, that was that, not overly exciting, but not bad.  After work I came home to talked to Courtney... and my pudding cup was feeling down, (R.I.P. Kyle) so I went ofr a walk with her and made her laugh.  (Anacanda Returns: Featuring Jesse Gunn and Nat Bailey!) I'll bring the camera... ahh ahh oh Jesse ahh ahh Jesse! hahahaha Then I came home, and I was hanging out, having a few drinks and then Kendall shows up at my house and her, Courtney, Cara, Tracey, Cara and Jenn are waiting in the driveway.  So I am talking to Jesse and Alex online and I am supposed to meet up with alex in 15 mintues, and they are in my driveway! So I get off, and go with the girls... and we go and meet up with Alex.  I am a little drunk... but that's not the point.  So we go drving, and once again.. my whole life flashes before my eyes.  WE had a goodnight, we cheered up Courtney, and I got to hang out with Alex.... (Damn school at 1am!)   Plus I got to talk to Jesse..... DAMN HE IS SOO FINE!  I talked to him and we are gonna hang out!  I can't wait! It's gonna rock!    TONIGHT me and the girls are going to the movies ... cause it's Sunday and there is nothing better to do!    Antowne Fisher is soo sad. I am crying still! Damn that movie!

      I think I may be a groupie... but I am ok with that.  We went to Jesse's last night for a private Jam session! Unlabeled gave us our own show. The night started out by us busing downtown... (On the bus we met some guy, and he called me opera, due to all the funny stories we have to tell!) ...which was a distance from Jesse's actual house. We called and Brian started to give us directions to walk... WALK there, but then they came and got us. (so sweet)  They thought it was going to be just me and one other person... they pull up, and Brian, Jesse and HOT Dave are all in the truck! So all 3 of us pile into the back of the truck.. with Inkers... explaining that we had an extra cause she couldn't stay at home tonight because she had been hurt. So I got to sit on Danielle's lap the whole way there. But I had no compliants, I could see Jesse better! We stopped at the beer store so Dave could pick of a couple of OE's and I said, what the heck, let's get some coolers! It was an awesome couple of hours! We got Danielle a little intoxicated on a school night (REBELS), we had a party just us girls in the bathroom... (I'm always here for you...) and we managed to watch Danielle fall on her ass not once but twice! She spilled water all over Courtney.. who didn't laugh then.. but I'm sure looking back will realize how funny it really was! We had to blow dry Courtney pants! The guys thought we were nuts asking for a hair dryer! The guys were awesome... played all our favourite songs! We got some sweet ass pictures of them.... BUM SHOTS... we even got Jesse to stick his bum out.. You guys are right, Brian doesn't have an ass!  Jesse gave us their first c.d... the one with only 3 songs... 2 of which are my favourite! I can now listen to UNLABELED whenever my heart desires!  So it being a school night we couldn't stay out too late... so the night ended with goodbyes.. (and hugs and kisses) and we started on our journey to the bus.  We stopped for food and a bathroom break for Danielle.... then got on the bus to our homes and our beds!  We didn't manage to find anythng cool as a little memento of our night.. but we do have the pictures, and the c.d.... so "borrowing" their clothes will come next time!

      Because I have nothing better to write about and class is boring the hell out of me, I am going to write about all the lame stuff I did last night.  Let's see....  Well I got home from school in a bit of a rut..... Yes damn that J. So I was mad, he has nothing better to do then to lie to me and to Courtney... LOSER! So I am over him, he is not worth.  To quote Alex: "He should die" hahahaha not really, but WHATEV. (yes Tai I have stolen it!) I did some homework... yes yes I did! GO ME!! Then I cleaned the bathroom, cause it was Monday and I always clean the bathroom on Mondays. So now my crapper is clean again!  I talked to my darling best friend/sister/cousin (no we are not hicks) Tania... and she is having troubles with boys too... again.. just like me. Kyle moved out on her.. ASSHOLE.. if I was there right now I would kick his ass. Over... she is thinking about marriage.. and he is not.... WHATEV. I don't get it.... but he is hurting her.. which means I don't like him... He was supposed to take care of her while I was gone.. not leave her.  Went on msn... I live on my damn computer.. it is quite sad actually!  But MAN OH MAN I am glad I was on.  Jesse came on..... Yes, the lead singer of UNLABELED and I got invited.. along with Courtney, of course, to a PRIVATE JAM SESSION! Oh yeah.. FREAK OUT!  Courtney and I were going to go for a walk.. but next thing we knew it was late.. and neither one of us felt like it.  Watched O.C. I cannot stand Oliver.. fake and phony liar, stalker, creepy guy.... man, I was so happy when Ryan punched him! But thank the lord he is gone next week... if the spoiler is right... then he is gone! But it is going to screw things up more between Marissa and Ryan. Ok my lameness has reached a peak.. I am talking about t.v. like I know them! Speaking of people I don't know... but pretend too.... My husband to be.....   NICK CARTER IS DATING A SLUT!  Oh yes... I cried, yes i did. He is dating that twig, Miss "I have sex tapes, but I am not a tramp" Paris I'll suck your dick Hilton! I am shocked! He likes her... and she is like in love with him! It was sad sad night in my life! I have devoted my life to him since I was like 11.. and now this... Nickolas.... why her? ok..

      Honestly everything I ever thought I wanted was in being a housewife.... a mom and loving wife.  Then I saw a movie that made me question my thoughts, and why it really was that I wanted this dream of mine.  Was it because yes, in fact I want to have a family, raise my children and be happily ever after, or do I want to be that person because my mother failed so bad at it? Do I want to do what mother didn't do.. but only dreamed of?  Do I want to hide behind a man because it is what I know?  Maybe in my heart I don't really want this.  I question this because every guy I attempt to date, I push away, don't allow myself to really be honest to me or my feelings, then when things go wrong cause I have unaviodlable screwed it up, by trying to make it perfect,.... I cry and wonder where the hell I went wrong, and contiue to see myself as worthless because yet another guy does not want me.  I know now after coming here, meeting my aunt, who to me is the most amazing woman I have ever met! Independant, smart, funny, witty.. truely inspriaing.... I know that I can have so much more, I can be smart, see the world and not feel bad for it.  I can still have my dream of a husband and children, but I can be funny and independant and not feel like I have done something wrong. Knowing how to fold laundry is good to know, but having seen the world is a chance that I have, that not everyone gets.  I can do these things and not feel like I have become someone better then my mother, I should not feel guilty about this.  Because in fact, I may have always been better then my mother. I know that I can put myself first, not be a doormat to someone else. I may only be 19, and I am still young, an adult yes, but still drying my wings as a new butterfly.  I am yet to discover who I really am.. and that No in fact I don't need to know what my plans are for my future, but as long as I follow my heart, I will have no regrets, and I will achieve the happiness I desire and deserve.  So I may want to be a housewife.. but if I choose to be something else.... I have the power to accomplish that, but if I do choose to marry and raise a family, then there is integrity in that too, but I have to make sure I am doing it FOR ME. So what really is my dream?     I shall tell you when I find it.... but until then I shall see the world

      Both of you are bloody goofs. Josh likes Nat, Nat likes Josh. Courtney wants Rob, Rob wants Courtney. End of story. Nat, it's not hard to get him to 'pick' you. First off, you are way more fun than her, you are waay prettier and you and him have more in common. And Courtney? You are going to see Rob. This discussion has ended.

      He said he likes THE  BOTH OF YOU?!?!?!?!  K first of all, not to be rude and overly mean.... but she is a HORSE! A COW! ANYTHING THAT IS BAD! That girl is so overly perky she makes me want to take my ears and eyes and shove them down my throat. You know what I think you should do??? Do something drastic. Make him choose! Tell him that you are not one to wait around and see whether you're the  lucky winner  or not. I mean that is absolutely retarded! I mean, look at you, look at her(Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick!). I think he needs to choose. And by the way, I think Operation:Shaving Cream Vehicle should commence this weekend.

He was nice, I was a sacrastic Bitch... but in a few minutes I came around and was nice.. well sorta nice back. He misses me and wants us to hang out.... um... dunno... for now we shall stick to e-mail! It's easier that way!

      My day today wasn't too bad! I got 80% on a biology test! Which means I am now PASSING biology! Which also means I can write my exam! I am so happy! Having to tell my aunt I was faling that class was not going to be cool with me! But I am almost stress free! Our last unit: reproduction! The human body! Hello... labelling the reproduction organs isn't that difficult! I am soo going to pass! Only thus securing my place in graduation!  I went to the movies tonight with Danielle... as if it would have been anyone else.... We saw Chasing Liberty. It was a cute, sorta sappy, predictable teen movie. But yes I liked it, even more so when *gasp* he took off the shirt and undid the pants! OH MY! So went to the galaxy.... yes of course Josh was there.  Apparently he was flirting with me... I think he was sorta rude.... but whatever. The best part was after the movie... I was in the loo and Tara stops me and asks me if I am going to date Josh.  Well I want to scream and yell..... "I WANT TOO DAMNIT! IF HE WOULD JUST ASK ME!" But in fact I stay rather calm and answer... if he ever makes up his mind... I am still waiting for him to kiss me... so I'll let you know when that happens. So we joked about it and she said she would put in a good word... apparenlty she already asked him if he wanted to date me.... he said he didn't know.... HE DOESN'T KNOW?? 2 nights ago he did want to date me! He also said something about being just a guy trying to finish school.... I am soo confused! I got my birthday present from my P.I.C. today in the mail! I love it!!! It is a silver bracelet (cause I can't wear gold!) that says P.I.C.!!!!! I almost shed a tear! I love it! I can't wait till I am home again so we can go out for drinks! (official count: 6 months and 1 day)  SCREEEAAAAAAAAAAAAM! haha Chilling at Danielle's tomorrow night! Enough said right there (parties.. probably not... beer... that is also probably a NO)... we will be lame and go to bed on time and do our homework.... but the thought of possible rebellion is enough to give me goose bumps!  Oh and RE-COMMENT on here... the damn comments disappeared and I had to add them in again.. so it looks like I have no friends.... which to some degree is probably true! Well I must go now.... geography homework awaits me... and I still need to make sure I pass that class! SCHOOL IS ROUGH!  In the words of my wise friend Jazz: "You're like chocolate for my PUNTANG!"    GREAT LIST! ... words I am going to START living by!  ONE.  Give people more than they expect and do it cheerfully.   TWO.  Marry a man/woman you love to talk to. As you get older, their conversational skills will be as important as any other.   THREE.  Don't believe all you hear, spend all you have or sleep all you want.   FOUR.  When you say, "I love you," mean it.   FIVE.  When you say, "I'm sorry," look the person in the eye.   SIX.  Be engaged at least six months before you get married.   SEVEN.  Believe in love at first sight.   EIGHT.  Never laugh at anyone's dreams. People who don't have dreams don't have much.   NINE.  Love deeply and passionately. You might get hurt but it's the only way to live life completely.   TEN.  In disagreements, fight fairly. No name calling.   ELEVEN.  Don't judge people by their relatives   TWELVE.  Talk slowly but think quickly.   THIRTEEN.  When someone asks you a question you don't want to answer, smile and ask, "Why do you want to know?"   FOURTEEN.  Remember that great love and great achievements involve great risk.   FIFTEEN.  Say "bless you" when you hear someone sneeze.   SIXTEEN.  When you lose, don't lose the lesson   SEVENTEEN.  Remember the three R's: Respect for self; Respect for others; and Responsibility for all your actions.   EIGHTEEN.  Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship.   NINETEEN.  When you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it.  TWENTY.  Smile when picking up the phone. The caller will hear it in your voice.   TWENTY-ONE.  Spend some time alone.

      What started out as snow is once again rain... and more rain... and hey... just for something original more RAIN!  I had to work last night... yep for the last hour it was just me and Jason... and no even though I no longer crush on him... it was still fun, we had a really good chat. And lots of laughs! But it was still a really dumb shift... 3 hours.... What is the point of that? Not sure... but Oh well! The O.C. was on last night.... I love that show! Oh but why, why is that Oliver guy suck an ass? Cause he wants to get in her pants! And he has issues! But who cares cause Adam Brody is sooo awesome! And the Newly Weds was on... Could Jessica Simpson really be anymore dumb? Wow I have managed to turn my really boring life into a really long blog about nothing! It takes real talent to do that!  I was thinking that someone I do not know may read this... they do not know me.. or anything about me.... I LOVE THAT! It's all about mystery... but after reading this.. they will probably think I am some crazy slut bag.... oh well.. they can judge if they want.... But they don't know me.. and that I love! And if they wanted to know me.. they could comment to me.. or e-mail me.... This life is insane!

      Hello all.... I have been neglecting.. I know... but I am here now.  Today I shall sumerize the rest of my weekend and my day today.  Ready.. you should be sitting... this is gonna be a long one!  #1.  Today... well I was ON TIME... early actually for class this morning.. doesn't normally happen on a monday! but I was! We went to MacDonalds for lunch.. nothing really exciting... The best part of my day was in geography when OMG I saw Alex flex.... I ALMOST DIED! I was in shabmles.. I turned all red and cried a wee bit... yes there were tears! It was bad.... but It was ooooooh sooo good!  #2.  As for Josh and the whole kissing me thing. I asked him why he didn't try. It's cause his friends were there.... that's true so it was no big deal.  But.... OH MY LORD... we had plans to hang out on Saturday night... they were to go and play pool, but Courtney and Danielle couldn't come.. they were babysitting.. so we were going to go watch videos... his friends were even intvited along!  Nope... didn't happen! He was supposed to be on his way to come get me and his truck broke! SHITTY FOR ME! So then instead of calling to tell me he wasn't going to pick me up I got to wait at my house wondering where the hell he was.... NOT FUN!. So in the end my aunt had to drive me to Danielle and Courtney. I could have stayed home to pout.. but I had already given up my bed to family who was staying over... so I had nowhere to sleep.. not a sofa or nothing!  So even after all this.... crap with Josh.. I wait and wait.. finally around 7pm last night... I was chatting on msn... he comes on... so I say hi... he then tells me he is sorry, and we talk about what is going on with us.. very strange... I like him, he likes me... but we aren't together... work and shit.. I dunno.. I am still confused.. but he seems optimistic... assuring me that everything will work out for the best. WHATEVER! Oh and then at school today.. he was a total jerk.. barely said 3 fucking words to me... I must have smelled or something.. I dunno I give up.  Speaking of smelling....  #3.  Niki still smells.... apparently she is going to not smell as my christmas present.... but she still does. I don't want to be mean but I have no choice... she smells! Niki... please shower... get some deorderant, and wear some perfume!  #4.  BAM IS HOT! So I finally got over to Courntey and Danielle.. who were babysitting for this Mark fellow that Courtney knows.... we watched A LOT of t.v... including BAM! (MTV ROCKS, I now have to get that channel!) Wow he is hot! I think I may take up skateboarding just for him! And elephants are sooo cool. Lucky bitch from the mail got to marry Raab!  YUMMY!  So while we were babysitting... they came home.. as they usually do!  Mark and his friend/roomate.. Clint.... which leads me to my next point....  #5.  Having a 27 year-old man in his underwear hitting on you isn't always cool.... especially while you are watching porn.... hahahahahaha GOOD TIMES! Well I got to watch Bubble Boy... no we were NOT doing anything else! NOTHING I swear! But it was still cool to be hit on especially when I was feeling like crap because of Josh. Oh and that night I brought Danielle Tai's hat.... but that we shall talk about later!  #6.   We are going on our adventure really soon! On Saturday morning! It is going to be so much fun.  Courtney may already be there in Vancouver.... hee hee but the day is going to be fun... just do some crusing.. destress before we have to come back and study like mad for exams! I can't wait! oh yeah... 1 month till Linkin Park... 1 month and 2 days till John Mayer!  My friends ROCK! oh date tomorrow night... Chasing Liberty!  Should we invite boys? I think so... we hang out an awful lot just girls.. I mean I love you gals lots.. but it is not getting me laid...  #7.  I have come to the conclusion that funerals are not good for people's spirits or for your soul.  If it is not bad enough that you have already lost someone you care about.. and you have to deal with that... then you are forced almost to think about dying even more and then you start on this downward spiral of bad things in your life. All the thing that make you sad.. all the mistakes you made.. what you have to show for in your own life...(or what yu don't have)... who will be at your funeral.... These are things that only bring you down.. make you cry and before you know it.. you have spent 2 days in bed crying at all the bad things in your life.. and you don't even get to realize the good things. I don't know.. dying is unaviodable.. but why does it have to be soo sad?  #8.  Hi Tania... you will be 22 on Wednesday.. wish I could be there babe.... HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! I love you lots! oh yeah and Ink will be 21 on wednesday too..... look at all the birthday drinks I get to have... hahaha  #9.  Ok... back to Danielle (the hat) and Miles... or should I say Tai??  I've said enough!  You can figure the rest out on your own!   #10.  I have to work tonight from 3:30 to 6:30.. talk about the GAYEST shift ever! It's me and 3 managers! What did I do to deserve this torture? Well at least Jason will be there.... but I am going to be watched like a hawk..I hate that!  WOW this is realllllly long.. so I am going to go now.... write more tomorrow!

      Ok, I so spent 3 hours preparing myself if in fact he did try to kiss me, and if I would kiss him back of if I would dodge it.  But for all the worrying I did..... IT WAS USELESS! He tried do to um.... NOTHING.  Not hold my hand, not touch me, not nothing! I am not sure why I am mad about this.. but I am. Ok yeah he has chapped lips and need lip gloss in a BAD way... but I had been thinking about him kissing me, I had mentally prepared myself for that... and then NOTHING! That pisses me off. Fuck him! and his stupid friend who can't get a clue or take a hint as to LEAVE and GO HOME! Ok I am better now.

      Last night was soo much fun.  Long walks, piggy backs rides, funny pictures, talking to INKERS!, watching videos.  Danielle, Courtney and I hung out last night because, well to be honest, there was nothing better to do on a thursday night, plus we are cool and SO HOT so why shouldn't we hang out? Then at around 11, I walked home... by myself... in the dark and in the rain! But 22 minutes later I walked in my door! Safe and sound.  You know what pisses me off today?  When hot guys... in cars... see you walking down the road... in the RAIN and just keep driving! Ok no they are not taxi's, and no they don't know me and I could be a pysco killer, but even still..... the thought is nice!    SHOW TONGIHT!! Gonna rock! 6 bands for 6 bucks!  Can't wait!  There is gonna be a rumble! The  DANIELLE EXPERIENCE  is coming out tonight full force.... and they are gonna knock some socks off..... and maybe some heads, if required!  ~SKIT~

      I knew that he liked you, you can just tell. Anyways it shouldn't matter, let me cover up the way that i feel cause it's not going to make a difference anyways. He DOESN'T like me, he DOESN'T want to be with me, and nothing is ever going to change any of that, so just go out with him. I really don't know what else to say about it.. Maybe if I see him with you then I will finally be able to get over him, which is sad to be saying but it's the truth. Hopefully he doesn't read these blogs, let alone even know what a blog is. You are one of my BEST friends, but I am not going to let you pass up this little Josh thing because of me, cause that's not fair to you at all, and it's not fair to him, since he already told you that he likes you. He most likely knows that I still like him, but doesn't care since he won't even talk to me about it, let alone anything else as of lately. So, once again, just go for it, but this time do it before I start freaking out, hahaha.

      Courtney, I love you and you are one of the coolest friends I have ever had!  As for the little crush..... I can't do it.. I will not have you hurt because of it.  SO straight up.. yeah I think I may have a thing for him now.... and he told me he likes me... But I know you are trying to cover it up... you still like him. I understand. Plus, hunny, we talk about almost everything.. if something were to happen between him and I.. just like any other boy I would want to tell you about it... laugh about it with you and Danielle.  But it being HIM, I couldn't.. I wouldn't want to be pushing it in your face.. that is just too hard for me.  So..  yeah.. this sucks.. but I won't let him come between us.  And like you said.. there ARE other fish in the sea.... I don't need to try and catch the same one as you!  And hells yeah I am SOOOO PUMPED for our adventure! It is gonna rock.... boys or no boys! But hello.. LOOK AT US... there WILL be boys!

      Today should be called a RAIN DAY becasue it is just raining and raining and raining! Which is taking the snow away.. which makes me sad. I like the snow! Plus I have to work today... yesterday they CLOSED THE MALL!  It sounds crazy.. but here in Nanaimo: the land of slush.... When they get snow, the MALL CLOSES so I didn't have to work.  I am supposed to go play video games.... Don't think that is going to happen.. unless he calls....  Well, I must go now.... I am lame and will write back later.... SEE YA

      Today was a SNOW DAY... and I wanted to go to school today! No I am not ill... though I may have a temperature! I can never remember wanting to go to school!   So what did I do today you ask? Well.. I slept till almost 1 in the afternoon.... loving that! Then I spent the next  3 hours  on the phone! With whom? Well Danielle, friends back home.. but mostly one person.... very strange I tell you! Not him.. but the fact that we were on the phone so much.  I was going to go over, but his mom didn't want me to get stuck or hurt out in the bad weather... how cute is that?  VERY!!! We talked about video games, family, things that bug us.. it was really cool.  I am still not sure what I feel about him.. I mean yeah he is cute, and there is something there.... but   1.  He is only 17... won't be 18 till AFTER I leave and   2.  Is it fair to him to be with me and me love someone else?  I mean I will always love that someone.. so I should be able to date other people right? I mean  HE IS!  I have no idea.  Plus this will only end up hurting my friend....even though she says it won't. So I am SOO CONFUSED! I hope tomorrow is a snow day cause I have a test and because I am supposed to go to his house and play video games.. but at the same time I want to go to school.... see CONFUSED!    HAPPY 20th BIRTHDAY JOSH!  Party it up in VIC... I'll see you in 22 days!!!  Going to bed now.... sweet dreams  Oh and my aunts boyfriend... who I lovingly call my UNCLE DAN.. his mom died today.... so now everyone is sad... and I mean me too, but I never met her, and I feel kinda useless.... plus now I have to go to a funeral for a woman I never met.... It is really quite hard.... May she rest in peace... and fly with the angels now.   LISTENING TO: um.. sappy chick music WANTING: Life to be less complictated NEEDING: sleep... sex hahaha ...sleep!

      Wanna know what the impitmy of lame is?  ME! I spent my whole night.. at Danielle's.. that is not the lame part.... she is not quite that boring.... but I ended up doing HER DISHES... for HER MOM!!! WITH HER BROTHER!!! Ok... the kid is like 14..... THAT IS WRONG! I mean he is cute... and there may have been some VERY CARELESS flirting.. WHICH MEANT NOTHING! But HELLO talk about Lame! When in true GIRLIE fahsion I was wating by the damn computer for someone to get off work so we could go out!So...  THAT is soo OVER... before it even had a chance to start! WE had plans to hang out....to go bowling.. ok yeah that part is lame too... making me even more lame but he wanted to go... I get off work at 9.... Call my cell and we will hang out.... BULLSHIT! His phone wasn't on.... he wasn't at work... ok I am not a stalker but I called there.. I used to work for the same company.. I know the rules.... and HE DIDN'T EVEN WORK TONIGHT! So he can want me really bad.. but he is NEVER gonna get with this!   .....well he may apologize... and I am a sucker so I may give in... BUT I am going to try REALLY REALLY hard not too!  I talked to my sister today... that was werid.. once again I eneded up in tears.... She always seems to make me cry... maybe it is because she can make me feel guilty for the way I feel.. and for what I did.. But I don't feel like I did anything wrong.  My mom is now really happy and for that I am glad.. She has a really good job now too! Go her!  Now maybe with all the goods in her life.. it will start to include me.  Kaylee doesn't seem to think it will..  but I am optimistic about the whole thing... I have no choice but to think that way.  And in all my tears..... my new dear friend RANDY... (Big shouts to PERTH ONTARIO) was there to make me feel better and cheered me up! Thanks hunny!  My soulmate decided today to tell me all about (pardon my french) Fucking his girlfriend....  GREAT   LIKE I care.... NO it is not me he's making love too.... I sure as hell don't want to hear about it with someone else!  All I have to say is YUCKIE!  ... Speaking of sex.... my favourite cousin... my best friend my B.I.P.I.C. had sex this weekend for the frist time... ok.. to you reading this it may not be a big deal at all.. but for me.. for her.. it is a REALLY big deal! But it was with someone she loves and loves her back... and it was all about RESPECT... so I am cool with that.. and HE IS SOOO HOT!!! ha ha... Ok NO I AM NOT EASY!  Big trip coming up... can't wait... VICTORIA is GONNA ROCK SOME HARD CORE ASS!!!!  Well I must depart now.. I am not waiting any longer by this damn computer for him... I hope he has a really little penis.. gives me more of a reason to LAUGH! hahahahahahahahahahaha yep just like that!  HOW HOT IS SIDKA??

      OH My..... I forgot how much skiing... or falling on my face rather could be sooo much fun! Danielle and I went to Mount Washington and were quite the little snow bunnies! Plus with all the hotties we were meeting we were very busy.  BIG SHOUT OUTS to Mike and Jake.... let the snowboarding lessons begin.... I hope you are prepared to watch me fall on my ass.... over and over and over again! I love chair lifts..... without them there would be no Mike or Jake! Who both believe Danielle is 19!! WICKED! But in all the fun we had.. and sweet ass pictures we took, my whole body aches... my arms cannot be lifted above my head for any reason without bringing tears to my eyes.  My hands cramped last night so bad I thought they would fall off! And my muscles just above my boobs hurt so bad that breathing to deep is no go for launch! But it was worth it!  PARTY ON BRAD!!! Oh and why are soo many snowboarder guys named Tai?? VERY STRANGE.... I kept turning around expecting to see THE TAI and but instead seeing some other VERY GOOD LOOKING GUY....  my head was spinning.. and not just from all the falling! But JAKE is hotter! WE soo melted the ice with that one kiss!!!  New Years was good.... I rang in the New Year with the coolest Chicks in Nanaimo..... but indeed had a bit of a cry.... mostly because my soulmate.. or the one I believe to be my soul mate was kissing someone else when his ball dropped 3 hours earlier then mine.... but the TONY HAWK tournament helped to cheer my mood up.. plus the thoughts of skiing the next day helped as well.  Plus I know that when I ring in 2005 it will be ME he is kissing.. not that STUPID STACEY!  Go TEAM STACEY in TONY HAWK!!!  I have just one question.... what is wrong with making friends? I seem to have people made at me for having fun and making new friends... I do not understand.... and I will quite frankly sum it up to be immaturity. 'nough said  I would like to say that YELLOWCARD is amazing and I would like to thank Danielle for hooking me on them!  I am sad because of the sweetest guy I work with is leaving and going back to Victoria for school...... Josh I miss you already and you aren't even gone... I soo promise to come and visit you... oh and you can bet on that hot ass of yours I will have the camera!!!   ADVENTURES ARE AMAZING!! WE are soo going on an adventure to Vancouver... and Courtney if I must "go to the mall" for a few hours I am soo cool with that... you deserve it babe!  And hello John Mayer is less then 2 months away!! I booked it off work today!  I fly back to Ontario July 14th... I will miss you lots... but let's not dwell on that yet... I still have to HUMP Jake!!!!  Damn Jake you soo fine! haaa haaaaa haaaa haaaa Danielle I think I might pee my pants... haaa haaa haaaa  Well this is getting way too long to continue on.. wasting your time and mine.. so I will end it now.... Good night all!!   Back to school Monday... SCARY!!!

       "I love you"   So yeah,  he loves me and I love him . I couldn't even breathe! I am on  CLOUD 9!  Wow, could things get any better? Well, yeah probably but NOT THE POINT! The guys came over yesterday from Vancouver.  Well it was just Rob and Adam. Like Kevin would ahve come here anyways.. he is DIRRTY!  Adam of course came to see Danielle, and she well, wanted him to be here so Rob would come see Courtney.  But that is neither here nor there. We hung out, had a reeeally good dinner that Danielle made and watched videos. Oh and fruit and this really GOOOD dip, that was made with milk products and I got sick and puked it up! Plus the dip tasted good on Timbits and on chicken and just off your finger!  Went to Tim Hortons for  "TIDBITS"  I ended up staying up to like 6 am with Rob watching movies (BLUE CRUSH) and talking about Courtney and how they feel about eachother... I guess technically he should have been talking to her about it, but whatever. They left early today so she could go to Danielle's "Grandma's Birthday Dinner."  Tonight we are going to Courtney's to watch videos... it's gonna be fun!

       A Day in the Life of a GROUPIE   Last night was my nana's birthday dinner.  (Happy Birthday Nana!)  After that first bit of rudeness and her usual bitchyiness it wasn't too bad.  We had a nice dinner and cake and did the whole presents thing. I had missed my bus to downtown (cause I had already made plans for that night) so my aunt drove me. (Thanks Auntie A)  Some  guy got stabbed ... much before I arrived in the downtown area, but I saw the firetrucks washing away the blood, and that was enough for me! Then later that night, my cab driver said he knew the guy, he was robbed by him.. he is going back to jail now for sure!   THE SHOW:   UNLABELED  played downtown under James St. Billiards. I arrived and on my way in... who was right there, watching the door? BAM BAM it was Dave and Jesse! Dave was sporting a new Mohawk, he was looking pretty darn good! The turnout wasn't that great, but that's because it was a Thursday night.  The show overall was pretty good.  The Johnsons  from Edmonton were pretty good.  We bought pins and stickers.  Plus we finally had money to get the newest Unlabeled c.d. (and after the last track.. there is a secret song!.. December in the MO!) Before Unlabeled played we went to Wendy's where I had a little to much fun with the Ketchup,  "I need a na-kin, get me a na-kin!"  then me and Danielle had our photo taken with  ANOTHER FOUNTAIN!  Then it was back to the show to wait to see the guys play. While we were waiting Carl and Brandon were chasing each other around like small children over a flag. It was quite amusing.  The the guys went on! Jesse had asked me earlier in the night to take photos for them for the website. So of course we did.. Lots of different angles, just as Jesse had asked! We are the best fans ever! We tried to stand in the front row, but some weird girl who was on a bad case of blow... and looked like she was humping the audience took up a lot of space with her dancing. Plus Niki stood there, like a totem pole, not even moving with the music, hell she barely clapped.... and she knew we were with the band.... I was ready to tell her to fuck off. I have no problems with her being friends with the guys, hell she can even hump them if she wants, but if I am doing something for them, GTFO of the way!    AFTER PARTY:  The guys invited us back to the house for the after party, of course I was in.. I mean HELLO... Danielle was tired and needed sleep, and Courtney well she wasn't sure what she wanted.... So Danielle rode the bus home with Nick (yes hottie Nick from  Last to Leave ) and after I spent like 45 minutes convincing Courtney that this was going to be fun... she was in! We got a ride to the party with Mexico's girlfriend Casey.  We had a really good, chilling (literally) in the basement with The Johnsons and the MAKEUP GUY! (the makeup guy looks sooo much like Courtney's Rob, and a little like Benji from Good Charlotte)  Had a couple beers, saw Brandon  (wigga what?)  and Curtis and CARL! Carl rocks.  We were dancing in the kitchen, and I got socks and KISSES (the kisses were from Carl.. and STOP worrying they were on the check, so I  DID NOT  break Lent. Brian was there, and he is excited for prom, which is good cause I am sooooo excited! Dave is hilarious, we love him! I touched his bum... or lack there of! I saw some girls doing blow in the bathroom, and that was INTERESTING to say the least. I told Melissa that I like her much better when she is drunk. To quote her:  "I like myself better to when I am drunk"  Next thing Courtney and I knew it was after 1am and we had class the next morning, so unfortunately our partying had to come to an end. We found the phone, called our taxi, got lots of hugs and thank you's from the guys, and we left. Neither of got any hump... and we ALL know Courtney wanted some from Dave.. hahaha  "You think Dave is Sexy?"  aww Mexico.. you are soo funny.  "I am the best and I number one in this band"  No Jesse, you cannot kick Dave out! hahaha  The Johnsons are coming back April 9th for another show.. and you can bet your ass I am gonna be there! All in all it was a very fun productive evening. And I loved every second of it. After all I am still the best fan ever! Even Mexico said that last night! (well me and Courntey and Danielle are the best fans ever!)   UNLABELED ROCKS   ... wow I am such a groupie, it is sickening!

       "I think I might still love you"   the best things happen when you least expect them too   Lent started yesterday. I am going to give up sex. Not that this should be too hard, I mean I don't have a boyfriend (or a girlfriend for that matter) and there are no potential sex partners that stick out in my mind anyways... (Well expect one....  PHONE SEX!  ) So I don't think this should be too hard. And it is over before prom.. NO WORRIES! It would be much hard if I gave up something like say.... Sweets.... YIKES... I would  have  to give in.  Sweet dreams everyone... I know mine will be.... they will be filled with fireplaces and couches, with t.v's in the background...... well I am hoping... my luck I will get some old smelly man selling cheese or something

      Could it be possible.... shit son.. I think it is  2 GOOD DAYS IN A ROW!   This is going to sound really lame... but I love life.... I love staying up till 12:30 talking on msn about stuff with people.  (naming unborn children is always a plus!) As my stomach was alll rumbly from eating ice cream, I chatted easily with people here and people in Ontario.  It is weird to think that I am 5000km away from them and with the click of the mouse I can be chatting with them, or seeing them through the power of a cam. See I think cam's don't do people justice looks wise... cause depending on your cam, you can always look kinda silly, or messed up. But it is still cool.  Technology is a wonderful thing and I shall embrace it!    Love is a wonderful thing and when you are lucky enough for it to come your way you must hold on to it, cherish it and respect it.  Love like you have never been hurt before and live each day to the fullest.  Now that I have been completely lame.... (Rob look what you do to me!) I am going to read Courntey's 11, yes 11 page blog that she has yet to type up. Damn limited computer access!  oh and you can NOW e-mail me from here! Just click on my name (Natter) and it will allow you too! Sweet eh? I think so!  ~he's loving me for me~

      "Elmo knows where you live!"  Oh My God, Nick and his friends are crazy! We tried to go bowling but it was damn LEAGUE NIGHT.  So we went to Dairy Queen and had sooo many laughs. We mixed all this stuff in one cup.... YUCK, then I put some on Hillary's mouth! hahahahaha Oh and watching Danielle flip across the table... fedding Nick brownies.... listening to some guy.. Jason I think, make fun of Pat. Watching Jackie freak out because Jason was making fun of Pat. And Nick just sat there and took it all like it was nothing new. But they are his friends. so I guess it isn't. hahaha oh well Oh and Cara and Tracey..... heard some stories.... enough said there!  Good times Good times  For instance they were talking about Miles.... oh my... "his parents go to bed at 8, stay up late on Saturday nights till 9pm reading!" hahahaha or this: "You can wear yourself as a hat"  Don't say SNAP anymore...  tres  annoying! but I think I need to puke.... too much damn ice cream.. the lacotse is making me feel quite YUCKY!    ~still miss you babe~

      Toast to: National Tortilla Chip Day!  UNLABELED has a show on Thursday under James St.  So as for Rob.... we have an agreement, an understanding if you would.  It works for me, puts a smile on my face. (5 months may not be an eternity but it sure can feel like one.)  Sitting in the career center on my spare... bored out of my mind.... wondering what to do.    After school I am going to the mall... shopping for my Nana... what the hell do I get her? I have NO IDEA! Oh then I am supposed to hang out with Josh tonight at 6pm. (No Rob he is not the one I am allowed) I seriously doubt he will even show up.... his loss  Danielle is in SHAMBLES!  ~Loves~

      Another post today.....   I had an amazing night even though I was sick.... $40 phone calls can really rock a persons life. But then one person comes on and tells you that you, and I quote:    "I don't really have anything to say to you.... I know how you feel about Rob, but You knew how I felt about him way back in the day, and you still went out with him. I forgave you, and I stayed your friend. You on the other hand have made it quite obvious that if Rob and I ever do hook up, you wouldn't come home... and I KNOW you wouldn't talk to me.... I think that's shitty"   So yeah... someone who was my friend is not anymore because of a boy.... one we have agreed not to fight over. And all this stuff when we were younger, fuck I don't even remember that. And that may be my fault... but even still.... And I cannot ask him to choose between her and I, cause she is there and I am here, so he will pick her... so much for waiting for me, so we can try again.....   I think it is fucking impossible to have 2 good days in a row. I can have 3 or 4 bad days.. but good days..... NO... this is fucking bullshit.....  I'm out

       WE ARE WALRUSES!   Saw 50 First Dates, it was cute and funny. A typical Adam Sandler flick.   Yesterday me and the girls went down to the waterfront.  We were  tourists  for the day.  It was funny, we took pictures of us doing  random things  in  random places.   Danielle and I were like 2 little school girls running around the fountain barefoot (we decided to stand in the fountain!) and then I pushed her in! She was soaked up to her butt! So we had to go into the sun so she could warm up and dry off.  We saw the fast ferry and took picutres of the...um.... boat... being painted! We drove to MacDonald's after Jenn decided to drive really fast (almost scared the poop right out of my body) after she saw some chick she doesn't like.... (it's old shit Jenn, let it go) We drove through Lantzville (saw Tai and Ryan's house) so Jenn could point out a street, but then didn't. If you like him Jenn TELL HIM! We went to Piper's but it was too cold to get out and walk around so that will be another day. Went to the movies after all that. "Good Morning Lucy" I went over to Courtney's after that. (Have fun in Vancouver today!.... be good!)   Last night I had THE BEST phone converstaion of my entire life! (and probably the most expensive!) July should be pretty interesting.... I can honestly say that this chance will be the last one I need cause you'll be so happy! (I need you)  ....please just wait for me.......

        Major Events of the last few days:     Wellstock .. totally rocked. Acted like a total groupie and loved every second of it.  Saw Nick (did the leg thing again!) and saw the Baaaaad boys of Unlabeled... got some good hugs (thanks Shane, Nick, Brian, Jesse and Dave) and was the first to get a copy of Last to Leave's c.d! Listen to some band totally ruin Nirvana.... my poor ears.  Unlabeled almost got kicked off the stage by our principal only to have Jesse and the boys  keep playing!  fucking fantastic  I was so proud to be able to say, yeah I requested that song! I'm a bad ass too! Just keeping the music alive with the sounds of FUCK YOU!  "You're wasting my time crawling on your knees"    "YEAAAH"  getting random guys to YEAAH is now my mission in life!    Breakfast  with Josh and Courtney. I had to climb up into the truck! The damn thing is huge. Josh isn't compensating for lack of size elsewhere.. is he? It was fun.  "Josh can we see you naked?"   He has apparently put some weight on 15 pounds in a month! So we wanted to see his new defined body!  Guys with  Accents : I have only one thing to say regarding this.... no matter what they look like they are 10 times hotter the second they open their mouths! (ok that sounded really superficial, but that's me....) And besides... some of them are really nice guys too! (Kris is in need of a good  pump .. anyone up for humping a Scottish guy?)   My classes  this semester suck. I have skipped so much already. I hate them, but whatever. I am almost done and  I will  graduate this June so I don't care!   We are supposed to be going to  Vancouver   this weekend. I want to go, but I am not sure why.  Besides riding the  sky train  it will be Courtney and Rob all cutesy like.... sickening! and once again I will be all by myslef.... with Adam as he misses Danielle..... LUCKY ME hahaha  I am sick of being alone.... but there is no sense in bitching about it. I am not going to get a boyfriend that way. Apparently being me isn't the way either....  I am going to have a good old time with  "The J Man"  himself! Oh yeah.... it is good to be me! Anaconda Returns is about to start filming! But for once in my life I would like to be liked for more then sex....    Rob  isn't coming to visit me in March anymore, and I now know the whole reason.... he confuses the shit out of me, but I still care about him more then I should.  July's homecoming should be very interesting.  My cousin  Tania  is having a  BABY  and is getting  MARRIED !  Kyle has finally come to his senses! Godd boy Kyle Good boy.  I am  sick  today. I feel like absolute shit. And puking is  NOT  helping my sore throat at all.  Well that is all..  I am done ....   Alex hugs  can make a persons day go sooo much better!  ok really I am done now.....

       wee willy man   I skipped english yesterday to go to work, only to leave again 2 hours later because it was completely dead. Loads of fun.  Because of Trisha writing me up, if I am late again I get fired!  It's bullshit! But she is gone in 2 weeks and that makes me a very happy girl!  I met a new friend yesterday.... his name is Kris.. and he is SCOTTISH... and you can bet your ass he's got the accent to prove it! He transfered here from Scotland and knows my "cousin" Sarah.  She said I had to meet him, so last night we went for hot choclate.  then we came back and hung out at my house.  My aunt came home from being gone for 2 days and was telling us her crazy story about the bitch female cop and her truck breaking down. it was really funny.  He probably thinks my whole family is on crack or something... but it's all good.  Last night Nick's band was having a jam session.... so like we did with UNLABELED (the best band) we went over and watch.  It was cool, I have never heard them play before, they weren't that bad. Kris was supposed to go to the movies with a friend of his, but we (as in Danielle, Niki, Courtney and I) brought him along with us. It was fun.  I got really tired and lied down with Danielle. She was stroking my hair, and at one point by an ACCIDENTAL roll, my face was.. um.... NOT where it should have been! hahahaha I got to "hump" Nick's leg again, and that was GOOOOOOD for me!  So Niki drove us home and I was going to do homework, I even opened my book.  But then I sat on msn, and that was much more entertaining then my bloody english homework! Rob never did come online.... he was probably sleeping... 3 hours ahead... I talked to Adam for a bit.  He was trying to pimp me out to stay his friends houses when we come over on the weekend.  Then we was trying to pimp out his friends. I may not even be able to go, damn work, damn goals..... GRRRRRRRRRR So as I was talking on msn to my peeps.... I decided I was bored out of my mind, and hey... so was my new SCOTTISH friend.... so we decided to go for a walk in the rain.. then he was going to take his mom's car even though he doesn't have a license.  So I was supposed to meet him at the church with his car.  Then he shows up walking.  He didn't want his mom to kick his ass for taking the car! So we went for almost a 2 hour walk.  But it was fun.  Oh yeah did I mention that Kris may have a thing for Danielle? yeah it's always Danielle. I am not going to get into it.. then I will sound like a jealous sappy girl who isn't getting any love and is wanting some and her friend has way too much for her to handle.. yet the guys wanting to give her love think I am not good enough. (leave me be.... I am on the rebound, and not getting any to rebound on...)  So before I sound like that I will change the subject.  My friend John got in car accident.. poor thing. But I have talked to him and he assures me that he is ok. I still was worried and asked him a bazillion questions to make sure. Then I sent him msn kisses and hugs to help make me feel better. (HI JOHN!)  Well I love hanging a spare.. it is a wonderful thing. I should be doing my CAPP homework, as I have to do a presentation, but don't have the work done to do it! Oh well, I hate CAPP anyways! Ok this is getting  tres  long (like Courtney's letter to me today)   xoxoxox

      Nanaimo sucks, and because of this we are going back to Vancouver this weekend..... HOPING! I don't have to work and if we can all get some $$$$ we are going! Now.. we just need to figure out where we are going to stay.  It would be cool if Danielle and I could stay at Adam's... I talked to him last night.... he is gonna ask his dad, and then Courtney will stay with Rob..... I am in class right now and it is  tres boring  so yeah.... the ways of the law.... I have to work again today.. no big deal, then I can watch the tape of the OC..... SETH HAS SEX! I can't believe it.... poor Anna.  Ok.... I am lame I am talking about t.v characters like I know them! But I have to work again... I just wanted to inform thee of the adventure of this weekend! It's gonna be GOOD!

       black lights and glow in the dark stars   I couldn't have asked for a better weekend. It started a little rocky with Danielle not being able to come see Linkin Park, but all in all..... let the good times roll..... and I shall give you all the details I think you should have...... Oh.... Sit down... get comfy.. this is gonna take awhile.....   THURSDAY   Linkin Park Day  Courtney, Grant and I left for the ferry at 10am via my aunt who was driving us..... Grant forgot his "toothbrush" so we had to make a pit stop.  Then we were off..... We rode the ferry and I didn't scream and freak out like the last time I was on the really big boat. We got to Vancouver around 12ish and caught the bus to our hotel.  I was soo amazed by everything.... I was a big nerd! But I loved it! So we checked in and hung around Vancouver.  I saw NUNS!!! yes ACTUAL NUNS!!! I would say hi to random guys and I bought Courntey a flower... I think the ladies in the store thought we were lesbians! We pretended to be  "super cool"  and had a smoke outside McDonald's! We went to a c.d store that was going out of business and I bought a SHAI (some good old Motown music) tape for a buck! That night we had a few drinks in our hotelroom, JUMPED ON THE BEDS, watched Grant do summersaults in the bed and then we went and saw  LINKIN PARK!   Story of the Year, P.O.D. and Hoobastank opened for them.  Wow I wasn't sure who much I would like the concert.. but it was F***ING AWESOME!!! I had to sit by myself cause Danielle couldn't be there..... and as heart wrenching as that was I met some cool people.... including JONATHAN! Who I happened to get to know pretty well over the course of the performance! GOOD TIMES!!! Everyone around me was drinking beer and smoking pot.. so what did I do?? NEVER MIND! I will admit to NOTHING! We went back to the hotel after and talked about how amazing the show was... and how Grant touched 3/6ths of the band and how we all wanted to have Mike Shinado's baby's! hahaha soo funny!  And the SHINDAO WATER!!! I just love people who talk in abbreviations.... TY.... Then we all passed out....  FRIDAY  We got up to our lovely wake up call from the hotel... we HAD to turn the heat down... Courtney cranked it before bed... it was soo hot! Then we went downstairs for our breakfast...... NO PAPAYA!!! Grant where is the PAPAYA? I thought they would have PAPAYA!!  We got ready..... saw some blacks under garments (SNOOPING!) We went to Courtney's grandma's to drop off our stuff... cause lugging it around was painful! Rob called as we walked by his house. (Rob: the guy Courtney is just a wee bit in love with and cannot describe very well... cause what we were expecting is NOT what we got! He is tall and flipping hot! It's like BAM there he is... break me off a piece of that shit... And the way he says bye on the phone.... mmmmm!) Apparently we are loud... who us? haha Courtney was happy.... he came outside and we got to wave. It was off to downtown where I could act like even more of a tourist.  I went on a SEABUS! Yes a boat like a bus!! It was so COOL! We then bused down to pick up Danielle from the ferry.  We were a bit hung over and the acordian bus was wiggly and I was feeling a wee bit sick.  No I didn't puke!  So Grant went off to ride the  "big boat"  and Courtney realized she needed to ask him a question.. so like a sappy chick flick.. she went after to ask him. I was soo proud! It was funny! And cute at the same time! So we went back to Courtney's grandma's... we hung around for a bit..... and then we spent a nice little time getting ready to go watch a hockey game at Rob's friend Kevin's.  Danielle saw Adam first and shotty him.. and I was like wait, I shotty first pick... so I get to choose... then I saw Kevin and was OK... you can have Adam. BALD GUYS ARE HOT! (man I AM superficial!) The Canucks lost 4-1 but I didn't see the whole game... oh well (it's not like I even like the Canucks anyways!) They lost to Atlanta! I had a few drinks.... got a little drunk... night number 2! (I listened to Nine Inch Nails... and found out that water beds, black lights and glow in the dark stars are totally awesome combination!) Back to the game: Rob was quite mad that they lost so we went on adventure to see the view... and to burn Rob's hat in the woods..... We lost Danielle for a bit.... but we are assured that she had fun. It was raining.... I LOVE VANCOUVER RAIN! It is very very good! Plus my favourite thing: KISSING IN THE RAIN! So then we went home... making Adam very late for work..... for once we blame something on Danielle! hahaha We arrived back at grandma's to go to sleep..... only to freeze our butts off while we slept. One night I sweat my butt off, next night I freeze it off.....   SATURDAY    Happy Valentine's Day  I wake up freezing.... and no one else is up yet... so I wait around and finally they get up! Danielle has to see Adam cause she left her purse in his car.... another sappy chick flick move! We (as in me and Danielle) made plans to go DOWNTOWN with Adam, Courtney made plans to see Rob.  Downtown is cool! I saw more cool things... Like the STEAM clock! " What are you trying to prove? That you can steam, that you are better then all the other clocks?" aww Adam you are soo funny! And the businesses.. very professional.. I was impressed.  MMM Starbucks! Cranberry Juice, c.d. shops, and Adam's crazy driving (Bus-Adam, or Taxi Adam, or BizAdam.. take you pick!) are also on the top on my memories from the afternoon. So we had to be back for Courtney around 3:30... so we could get ready for  JOHN MAYER  Adam drove us back... only to leave again and then be back again an hour later to eat dinner with us.  Gotta love lasgna and garlic bread and fruit salad! We made a toast:  "..... and to stealing hats, and after shave....."  so funny! I thought I would die! Quote of the evening: "Just keep swimming, just keep swimming!" So after dinner.... it was JOHN MAYER TIME! Oh my Sweet Jesus, there are not enough words in this language to describe how amazing that man really is! I cried like a teething baby... Him singing his heart out.. on Valentine's Day really made me see how important someone is to me! PLUS it was taped.. which means DVD.... OH MY I will be able to relive that night over and over and over again After we saw the SEX GOD himself we got on a bus to go home.... chatted with Rob at the church for 5 minutes..... damn smoking! so tempting... then went home to bed! Let the sweet dreams begin!  SUNDAY   The dreaded day of leaving....... So we get up to the smell of warm homemade cheese buns! MMMMMMM.... after breakfast we went to Rob's (so Courntey could say bye) and to watch NASCAR Daytona 500!! Rob hates watching cars go round and round so Danielle and I went in the hot tub.... wearing what you may ask? Our knickers and Rob's dirty t-shirts.... let the good times roll! As we were leaving to go get the bus to the ferry BizAdam calls, he is going to drive us.... NOT SURPRISED! He just wants to see Danielle! So we survivie one more car trip with Adam! We board our boat... after everyone BUT me gets kissed goodbye... (I just kind of awkwardly excuse myslef and go inside)then we go up to the top of the boat to wave goodbye to guys there for everyone BUT me... oh well I don't care.. Courtney is in love and Danielle is in lust... and I am ok with that.  So after much waving, flashing and kiss blowing we are off, on the journey back to Nanaimo. DAMN SEAGULLS! Danielle's mom picks us up and we all go home.  What everyone else did I am not sure... I can only speak for me. I did laundry and sat in front of my much missed computer waiting for MY Rob to come online.  Oh and he did.... But before he did... I spoke with Courtney's Rob to get Kevin's number.. to you know call and say "hi, how are you, when the boys come to visit you should come too... that would be cool"... nope, can't have it. Well to be completely honest I can't say I am shocked... I mean if Rob thinks I am loud and weird, Kevin probably feels the same.  And I was ok with that..... because Rob is coming out to visit me... or is he?  HE IS NOT  I am not sure why.. he wouldn't tell me, but he is not. Did I cry? You bet you ass I did.. lots and lots. I love him... that's all I talked about this weekend.... How I didn't need to get some cause I have Rob coming in March..... well  NOW I DON'T!  and that breaks my heart!  Oh.. and the night gets worse.... so first Kevin.....(mild sting).... then Rob....(painful break to my heart)... then Josh.... my prom date.... well USED to be my prom date... has a final the day of prom at 7 pm...... that is just icing on the fucking cake!   In conclusion to what was probably a damn fine weekend what did I end up with? ummm... no prom date, a sore heart (possibly fractured) and a bladder infection (no explanation to be given).  But it isn't all bad. I have a few great memories that will last a life time.

      This weekend, to be honest kinda blew, but had some very fun highlights!  FRIDAY  night Danielle was at her dad's and I had to work till 9:30, afterwork I went over to Courtney's for what was supposed to be an hour or 2. I was there till almost 2 am! We talked about boys and did nerdy things, but it was fun. (I will hit you with my purse again!)   SATURDAY  I worked... as usual, then after work I came home and had a bubble bath. I must say that Danielle's tub is much nicer then mine.  Mine works, but it's not big enough and or deep enough! After my adequately satisfying bath, I went and hung out with Alex.  I had such a good time.  We walked around and talked.. like really talked... sat on top of a mountain and I got a camera lesson. It was a lot of fun. We realized how very different we are, in fact I think the only thing we agree on is that we are opposites. hahaha But as opposite as we are I enjoy his company and hanging out with him, it's fun. But because of drama queen problems people seem to stir up in their heads, I think we may not hang out anymore, and that saddens me.  "Look Alex... it's a boat!"   hee hee.... I was home 5 minutes, 15 at most and left again to go to Courtney's where Danielle and I dyed her hair this awesome brownish reddish colour... but as I tend to repeat a bazillion times...  "red heads have more fun and are more passionate lovers!"  hahaha WATCH OUT FOR COURTNEY! We watched JACKASS, my lord that was FUNNY! BAM and STEVE-O and all the guys... oh good times! Then it got late... so I came home and went to bed!  SUNDAY  Today I had to be at work for 10am for special training. To be honest it was actually quite fun! The I got home from work had supper, did some homework, TALKED TO ROB and have sat on my ass in front of the computer and done NOTHING! Speaking of Rob... if.. I mean WHEN he comes here over march break.. it's gonna totally rock, but I am still scared! ROB ROCKS!!  Well apparenlty I am fake and superficial.. I LOVE IT. You can judge me, and the more judgments you make just prove how truely little you really do know about me. And that makes me happy, cause in 30 years from now none of this will matter, you will have your friends and I will have mine.  Lord knows they won't be the same people.  Cause, you know, I'm like totally trying to like totally be different!  hahaha I spit at that. I am who I am, and I am proud of that. I don't hate anyone, I just like some less then others, and knowing someone smells bad, is not cool.... we have tried to help.. really we have. Now I could be a btich and pick apart you like you have tried to do to us, but you will never overthrow us, so try to come between us.... it will not happen.  More then likely you are just jealous that we get on so well, and you are left standing in the dust of what used to be your friendships.... Accpetance helps get through life... learn it, love it, use it! oh one more thing..... GROW UP!

      Well darlings..... I will try not to make this tooo long, but this week has been CRAZY and hectic and it isn't even over yet! Monday was Marnie's birthday... and we all know how I am with that. I e-mailed but what more could I do? Tuesday was the second day of new classes, and I had to work, work sucked and I missed Rob! I wanted him to hold me and tell me that yes indeed Marnie knows I love her, and that it would be ok. Wednesday was hard because I got an e-mail I really didn't want, and I cried some more. TODAY..... Let's see, I enjoyed my spare... NO MORE PHOTGRAPHY! I talked with my father only to find out he did exactly what I could have done which DID NOT help me AT ALL! I mean COME ON daddy I am sick, I need to go to the doctors, and can't. I may never be able to see a B.C. bar, or even get my driver's lisence.... what the fuck? So I got really mad at him, he once again didn't listen to a word I said so I hung up on him and had my aunt tell him that I didn't want to speak with him. I went to work, only to find out they had CHANGED the schedule and in fact I didn't need to be there! Trisha patted me on the head and called me silly girl... If I hadn't started to cry due to stress overload I would have probably hit her, or yelled at her! I was sooo mad about everything. I got home and had a couple drinks, so I called up Courtney and asked her to go for a walk with me.  WE went.. in the pouring rain... and we got to Inker's work and we waited for him to come out on his break, but we never did see him, oh well, so I came home... soaking wet.  I was still really really mad, and I have been crying all week.  I mean I miss my family, and yet I find myself not wanting to return to Ontario for more then a few weeks, if even at all. AND THEN BAM, I am sitting online... just doing much of anything, and Rob comes online. This puts a smile on my face... the first real one of the day.  And yet things just keep getting BETTER..... He very well may be.... DOUBLE BAM  COMING TO BC!  So what did I do? I called Courtney, jumped about my house and SCREAMED at the top of my lungs! Yes yes, just when I thought this week was not going to get better, it did.  ROB ROCKS MY WHOLE WORLD!!!  Nighty Night

      Dear Marnie Lyn,  Hi Hunny, How are you?  Happy birthday baby girl! Today you are 9.. I guess you aren't a baby anymore....I hope you have a great day! Did you have a party? I bet mommy made you a really yummy cake. Did all your friends come? Did you get some nice presents? I sit here and write this to you, knowing you may never see it, and it makes me cry.  I cry becasue I remember your smile, your laugh and how you could always brighten up my day. I also remember all the fun we had, how you changed my name so ours matched, and how I was once so important to you.  Do you remember that I love you? I told you I always would, you are my shooting star.  Happy birthday Marnie.... (the numbers match again...9 and 19.... you used to love that) You have a birthday card and some money waiting for you here, if you are ever allowed to get it.  Love,      Your big sister,                           "Sari"                                  xoxoxoxoxoxox

      Me again.... so last night I went to the movies with Courtney and Niki.  We saw The Perfect Score.  It was good. I won't give any details for those who want to see it, but it was good.   Friday night I went to Courtney's and we were chilling hanging out on msn when my best friend Jazz comes online freaking out about Rob...  "he's mad at me, you need to call him, he hung up on me, he's crying...."  So I call him from Courtney's and he is really upset.... I will spare you all the embrassing for him details... but it came right down to him asking me to come home. Oh man... I wish I could have gone.. to be with him at that very moment.  (Rob, you throwing up in my ear from 5000km is still really yuckie!) I will see him in July... and I can't wait.... I can picture it my head... and I know I will cry and I also know that he will be the one to make it better. He's my soul mate.... my destiny is with him.... I just hope he knows it too!.... cause if he feels differently... wow that would suck for me!  Well I am off to the mall..... I shall write more later.....

      So yeah we talked last night.. It was  tres weird ... mostly because it was as if nothing had happened and we were us again...but not...  pretty much right up until goodbye time. Then it got weird..... I actually had to say bye... No mushy gushy stuff.... I mean just because I am not saying it doesn't mean I am not THINKING it! It is amazing when you think things could not get any better.. How they always seem to crash. But I thank the heavenly father every night for the friends that I have. They were so awesome last night.. in everything. The tears, the shouting, more tears, and then the confusion and frustration.   (**thanks Danielle, Courtney, Tania, Jazz, Coreena and of course my Auntie A**)  So at school today.... It is sucking big time. I am tired.... due to lack of sleep! (my brain will just not stop spinning long enough for me to fall asleep at a normal hour) Everyone here is like in a daze.. void of anything but a frown... we all have so much going on right now. I guess it is just easier not to say anything at all.   Well my tummy needs food, so I am gonna go....    Parting is such sweet sorrow

      I am at a loss of words... I thought I knew what I wanted, I mean I guess I still know what I want and who I want these things from...  what I am trying to say is I got dumped.. on msn.. ok yeah that is where everything started again... but I thought it was going to be different this time, better even. How can someone say they love you and then tell you they can't say it anymore. How can you listen to them cry and hear their pain but not be able to be the one to make it better?  I love him so much, I still believe we are meant to be.. but I am truly hurt and angry, not at him just about the entire thing. I feel almost lied to, betrayed almost.. like does he really love me.. did he really mean it? I am so confused.. I mean I know I don't have to worry about it I don't go back there for 108 days or something like that , and by then everything could be ok.. but what about now? I mean Jazz didn't even think this was going to happen. He had mentioned it was moving to fast to HER, but not to me, I just kept getting the I loves you's. I don't know I really don't know. I want to yell I want to cry and I want to hate him and I want to hug him all at the same time. Mostly I just feel void... and all he said was he doesn't want to be with me, we are taking a big step back....  Ok I am done.... Yes THE OLD NAT IS BACK.... Be prepared for TROUBLE! No more sappy talking, no more making everyone puke.....  CRAZY OLD NAT IS BACK!  This could be scary!

I went to Courtney's and ate waaaaaay too many little cupcakes! and 2 cookies! Then I came home and talked on msn and then I went for a walk with Alex. We went up to the mountain.. our little chatter box spot. We saw people down at the beach and we saw some people walking their dog. It was cool. We talked about stars... and the moon! hahaha! WE are soo lame.. and of course we talked about my Rob.. lol.. LAME I am!   But I am tired... a long ass day at work.. and then downtown. So I am gonna go.. I don't really feel like typing.. I am grumpy! So good night all....

      So life is life eh?   I had to work last night and it was alright... Me, Jason and Robyn.. fun times. Plus I got to go say goodbye to Candice... (have fun in Victoria.. keep in touch!) Oh and we had this new girl, who is supposed to be competing to be our new assistant manager, but the entire time I felt like I should have been paid for babysitting! So yeah that is what I want from my new assistant! I spent 3 hours working completely on the stupid underwear rack.... GOOD LORD that sucked ass! But I had some fun anyways! It was better then being at home.. with no computer....  Yeah no computer... Why you may ask? Well when I was napping, and my darling cousin was on the computer "The power went out" I don't believe the little shit at all.. but whatever.. So needless to say our internet driver thing in our computer is fucked and had to be taken in to get fixed. But hopefully I will have that back tonight... I miss it!  The fleas are gone... yeah our house had fleas... Not cool , but they are gone now thank heavens.. Even the thought of them made me itchy!  I talked to my daddy last night for almost an hour! It was really good for us.. We talked about so much. For once in my life I can say I am sooo proud of him! (Love you daddy) Plus I got to talk to my bubbee... He makes the cutest sounds!   My toe hurts soooo bad, I hurt it and now it throbs and hurts to walk... but I am not going to limp... Limping is for wimps!   So it is FRIDAY.... and my big plans for tonight... I am going to work! YES I am soo cool! Last to Leave has a show.. but damn work... sorry Nick... And the big plans for SATURDAY... Well Coreena and us are supposed to having a blast.. but who knows these days! If I was back home on Saturday I would at a keg party... but let's not go there.. hahahahahaha   But the career center is getting really boring! I want to do something.. go somewhere...   So yeah.... That is all that is new with me... I am LAM-O!  Peace out... oh and I have gone through and deleted posts that are no longer a requirement... Because they involve people who I no longer associate with.... so if the blog seems a little sketchy in spots... that is why!  xoxoxoxox

       113 Days   $$ I skipped English today... only to meet up with Danielle and Courtney at Country Club... they were skipping too! It turns out that Courtney wants it to be Valentine's Day everyday.... but for everyone BUT me.... and why is that? hahaha she just wants to  lie on her back like a bug with her legs in the air!   $$ Turns out I might not have a prom date..  cause his girlfriend doesn't want him to go .... ahh Bite my ass!  WHATEVER!  I just happen to have bought the damn ticket already.. and have a $300  UN returnable dress... but  NOW I have NO date ... lovely!  $$ Family sucks sometimes...'nough said  It's just like Britney Spears in Crossroads... my mama doesn't want me either.....  $$ Work tonight was good. I sold so much stuff on Sunday I didn't even need to be there! But I just did more... haha. I closed with Jason... that was cool, I didn't have to vaccum! He told me how he thinks my aunt is hot.. and how she is a  MILF .... loads of fun! hahahaha plus Niki and Oriaunna came into visit me which was nice.. and the second time they came to visit they brought me a present! Which was.... Rhys and Kyle! The cutie grade 10's from across the hall. Rhys gave me a hug and Niki laughed cause I am now going to  jail  for sexual conduct with a minor! hahahaha It was JUST a hug I SWEAR it was just a hug.. and I said NO, your honour, people of the jury:.. I DIDN'T want that hug!  GOOD TIMES ... Niki saw Kyle's house..... and apparently he has a hottub.... kinky.... Plus I saw Candice.. she is leaving soon and moving to Victoria.... to what? Yes to be with a BOY! So we got to giggle and talk about cheesy stuff together!  $$ I came home... did my chores... had a  BUBBLE BATH .... painted my toe nails... played some cards with my aunt.. talked on msn.... talked on the phone....  $$ My cousin is really starting to piss me off. He thinks he can control me and tell me what to do and it really is starting to piss me off! I told him to FUCK OFF last night.  He just pushes my buttons sometimes. And he doesn't fucking listen to ANYONE... he has NO RESPECT... little shit.. I hope he gets his ass kicked.. maybe it will knock some sense into him!   I am writing this part because I know you won't read it and if you do I know you will laugh.. but I don't care.. it's not like you comment anyways!    $$ Rob and me we had... a something tonight.. it was really weird... I thought I was confusing.. one minute he knows what he wants.. the next.. NO idea again.... but we talked and things are better again...  (YES we are still having S'BABIES!)  .. I never realized how hard it is to be with someone who is soooo far away! And the more you love someone the more complicated it becomes.... But we are MEANT TO BE TOGETHER.. so we will work this shit out! Tonight we were making funny sounds... (I love you Marvin the Turkey.... but the  goooat  is so much funnier! ... oh and you promised Marvin!) I am proud to say he is my boyfriend and that I love him... cause he gets me... (he should we have been together on and off since we were 15!) They say when you find the one you will know... well I know! Plus he mailed me a letter... I got it Monday.. I LOVED IT!! and the c.d was sooo sweet! Ok.. I can hear the puking sounds.. I am done  So that is it for now...  Going to bed cause I have bloody class in the morning! Night y'all ...oh and the $$ are supposed to be there... I wanted them there!  **Thanks for the ride to work yesterday Niki... really sweet of you!**

       "will you be my girlfriend?"   So my friends don't read my blog anymore... why you may ask.. cause it sickens them.. hahahahaha so I guess I must find myself a new topic to spend endless hours talking about! I am on the search for something unsickening!  Friday evening Last to Leave have a show at Mal U but I have to work till around 10.. so I won't get to go.. which sucks... cause they are good.. and chilling with Nick is cool... gotta love air humping his leg! Oh Nick you is so fine! hahaha  This Saturday is gonna be soo cool..... COREENA you are soooo coming to the MO and having a good old time with us..... BEER MUCH??? nah.... we will just chill out and be lame.. but it will be fun!   So I said some really mean things to Niki.. and I probably should apologize for them... just I should have apologized for driving her car... which was SO MUCH FUN! But I don't feel THAT bad... I mean she is being retarded... WHY ARE PEOPLE SHEEP? Jenn is being retarded too...(yeah I called your brother ....DRUNK... for a ride... and to tell him to make sure you were ok... and YEAH I ASKED Tracey where you were.. she said she didn't know! And of course I was worried about you.. and how I was gonna get home.. I was intoxicated...) So maybe in fact it is just me... so shoot me... Maybe I am the screw up... maybe I am the one  CAUSING  the problems... I don't even care what people think anymore I really don't. Cause the people here who mean anything to me (they KNOW who they are) I will keep in touch with when I leave in 115 days!   March break is over.... 1 month and 2 days till prom... SCARY! I am excited.... now if only my date will call me so we can finish planning what is going on.... But reagardless it is going to be soooo much fun!  So that is it for me... all the GOOD news I have all invlove Rob... and I really must stop making my friends puke.... so I won't say anything..... except  I LOVE YOU!   .... no meh!   That's it.. I'm out....

       "S'babies..... I love you"   Last night was interesting..... I had a couple good old drinks at home, nearly passed out on the living room floor... then I went out with Jenn and Courtney to Tracey's ex Ryan's for a drinking party.... yeah! So we had a few drinks... watched Hilary get COMPLETELY hammered on  1  somewhat strong drink! Taled about prom...Cara:  "I'm going to prom with ALEX CASWELL"  Me:  "You're the reason I am not going to prom with Alex Caswell"  hahahah good times! We went on a mission to get Jenn laid...had this peter guy sorta interested.... then BAM that's when we noticed her GONE.... like NO where to be found.. no car or ANYTHING so we were worried.... in a wee bit of a intoxicated state with called her brother... then as we are calling Josh to come get us.. she comes back! Then she gets really mad at us.. she we call Josh back to come get us.... but it is Josh and he doesn't know directions AT ALL.. so WE LEAVE! WE are walking to the Civic place to call Josh to come get us... and we get honked at..... BY JEN... oh so now she can drive us in her car..... so at the end of the night... we were mad.. she was mad... so we all went home!  So now I was at home.. sitting on the computer.. a wee bit intoxicated.. when Jazz and Brad tell me to call Rob in like 15 mintues.... so... OF COURSE I DO... so I end up talking to him for waaaaaaaaay to long.. my phone bill.. AAAAAHHHHH Turns out my dad has been talking about me to people and CRAZY SHIT! And it gets back to Rob... but it is good stuff and he likes tha fact that I talk about him.... I told him to talk to my friends.... they could tell him I NEVER shut up about him! So we were talking... and he was being all sweet and cute.... (I miss you, I love you, come home) and I was being equally cute and cheesy!  But the best part.. his friends were there... and he didn't even care! Turns out his friend Aj knows my sister Kaylee....... so Rob is all excited cause now his hunt to find my family is going to be a lot easier then he thought! SO yeah I cired.. and Rob made it all better. In his drunken state he told me he can't wait for us to start a life together.... and his mom thinks I am gonna live there by the time they get back from camping 12 days later! hahaha Rob was like  "Yeah.. she is!"  hahaha but I am done rambling..... so I am gonna go....   PEACE OUT!

      I had a really good day today.. I SLEPT IN! and went shopping with my aunt. We went out for lunch and then went and played tennis. If you call what I was doing tennis... I must have looked so funny! But it was a lot of fun!  I did this really cool thing with my hair today.. it is really curly... and it looks so hot!  I am so in love... I don't know how much longer I shall be able to control myself!

      His name is  Rob .. he gets me, he understands, and good lord he knows how to make me smile and cry (happy tears) all at the same time!  She just makes me feel special, I've never had a female that really bragged about me.   I don't know exactly how it started, but I loved her in highschool, before she even knew me   I loved to just look at her, I just... there was something.... I just loved looking at her   I just haven't been able to stop thinking of her since we have broken up    So tired... and the headache is killing me.... I stayed home tonight... worked on the blog.. trying to find NEW template... so the search continues..... Work was good.... but I am bored now.. so this is it!   hey Coreena.... as your counsellor.. I think you need to CHEER UP! hahahaha.. where's my e-mail?

       Last Night:  It was St. Patty's Day.. so we need to party! And celebrate Niki getting a job.. so we got apple juice...mmm, yummy. I drove Niki's car... HOLY SHIT that girl can get mad.... LOL... but whatever... I won't write how I  really  feel cause someone might get mad.. and then I would be the bitch again.. and I should be nice at least one day a month... but NIKI: I don't recommend going around calling people ugly.... I can still make you cry! I may not be  "pretty"  but.. that's where I'll end that sentence...! We went down to the waterfront place... meet some  interesting people,  took some cool pictures... awww Frank Ney! Saw the "Girl" who humped Jesse  (it didn't mean anything to him!)  and I quote: Have fun fucking Jesse!" hahahaha! So much for  RETURN OF ANACONDA.  Danielle saved some seals lives... cause Niki wouldn't... even though it was her fault! Found a fountain filled with....  BUBBLES  So of course... what do Danielle and I do? PLAY IN IT.. and YES of course.. I made her FALL IN! It was sooo funny though.. her then being soaking wet.. rolled down a HUGE ASS hill! We had a snow ball fight! Danielle and I had a dance party in the parking lot....  SHAKE YOU BOOTY!  ...went to  Timmy Ho's to pee, so it wasn't in my pants ( a tucan beak.. and beety rat eyes...)  and then headed home... where I.. proceeded to stay up reallly late talking to a BOY... well THE BOY!  ... just trying to make it better... make it work.. I think we are cool now...xoxoxoxoxo   Tonight:  After my nap... wow I feel like an old man (that's what only 4 1/2 hours of sleep will do to you, and a day of work...) I talked to my hunny pie... who always manages to make me smile... even when I may try to be mad at him.. I can't be... This is one of the hardest situations of my life. (I love you... NO meh)  At around 11 Courtney and Jenn came and picked me up.. we got Danielle and proceeded to go to Timmy Ho's.  It was fun.. sat in there for an hour, just chillin, illin.....drinking some caffine beverages and eating TIMBITS... mmm yummy! Danielle had to be home at midnight, so we dropped her off, but the three of us weren't ready to go home just yet.. so we went downtown,  DROVE DOWN THIS SWEET ASS HILL!  ...Got pulled over by the cops for CHECKING JENN'S TIRES.... hahahahaha, went to Timmy's... again.. this time with Jenn's brother.... HILIARIOUS!  "YEAH.. baby.. you know you want it..."    HE HAS A FUZZY BUM!  Followed by more drving around... went to McDick's to see Dale... who DIDN'T  "yeah"  but we got free nuggets.. which was nice.. and then we drove down this one REALLLLY dark ass scary road... and yes I was scared... but I was soooo brave I didn't even cry! Finally we were bored.. the caffine had started to wear off.. so it was home to bed... to the BLOG! haahaha  But I am done now.... so I am off to bed.. cause I just may have to work tomorrow... we shall see....  Loves xoxoxoxo

       "I would love for us to build a life together, I'm at the age now, that I want to start gettting ahead in life, with that being said, I want to make sure that we build a foundation starting with her and I. That we are happy with life and we can move out and get ahead so we can start having kids...kids that giggle like her, I must add...."   I am on Spring break.. and it isn't bad.   I had to work tonight. Yesterday was my day off, and I didn't do much.. and it was NICE!   Well that is all I need to say for now.  Less then 4 months.. love you.. S'Baba!

He always finds some way to show me he cares, even from a distance.  "...whatever your tastes, they are truly in synch. You make one another feel fulfilled, appreciated and loved, and yours is a happy union"  A QUIZ said that about us... quizes are never that accurate.. but look! .. ok I know I am being sappy again!

      I had this huge long entry I was gonna type up and put in here.. but now it isn't woth it...  Well I have lost my 2 best friends over a boy.... and not that I care... but he is now leaving for 8 months cause of me...   The word sorry seems like nothing.. but I am not sure what else to say at this point.. cause arguing and begging just seems pointless.  The worst part is they were friends, had other friends and lead great lives before me.... then I come out here, and in the 7 months I have been here, it has caused them nothing but crap.... so maybe they are right.. maybe it is just me.... Maybe I attract trouble...   So yeah I screwed things up.. again.. FUCK... WHEN will I learn.....   Maybe my ontario departure is sooner then I thought. Cause maybe these people I care about will be better off without me....  C & D: I am sorry... I don't know what else to say.... and please don't hate me for fucking up.... love me because I am an idiot who doesn't know better...

I pray to God you treat her right.. or I will kick your ass!  You still don't deserve her.   Whatever.. I don't even care anymore.   YEAH I DON'T CARE!    Courtney.... be careful.....

       "you should go to bed now... you really should go to bed now...."   Back at school  I am still sick, feel like shit on a stick.. if it is possible to feel like that.. then I do! So yeah!  I have come to this:  people are sheep!  Why can we not get along and just have peace in our lives? Cause people are sheep and we feel it necessary to follow the herd.. or the one in front of us. So yeah.... if you cannot tell, I am slightly pissed off about a lot of shit. But it is completely irrelavent to you, the one reading this, so I will not indulge myself in all the bitching I would love to do and I will change the subject.  HE APOLOGIZED... Yeah Tate said he was sorry for hurting me waaaaay back in like November... I am over it now.. but it was still nice to hear. He said he wanted to be with me, but he wasn't ready. But he thinks I am beautiful and he will always be my friend. Plus he is really happy that I have found that one who wants to be with me! Tate.. what a good guy.. now if he would make up his mind and stop playing my cousin Sarah... the I would have a little more respect for him!  So yeah I talked to my darling Tania last night..... I am getting more and more excited to go back to ontario everyday! Yes I am scared beyond words about what will happen when I get back there, and how things will turn out.. with everything... But Fear is 50% Excitment.... so I open my arms to the many possiblities awaiting me and my life in Ontario....  and if it sucks .... I will come back to the MO... and become a BC resident.... or I could go to Europe or hey.. if I wanted to bad enough I could go to the moon, cause in the 7 months I have been out here I have learned that there is nothing standing in my way anymore... I just need to try! I leave in 3 months and 34 days!....... I AM COMING BACK TO THE 5-1-9! And I am bringing people with me! la la la la la  Well that is about it for me.....  Being told  "I love you"   everynight totally ROCKS!... even if my phone bill is gonna be HUGE.... it is worth it to me!   I see:   Mr. Fuzzy Bum.. who is sitting 2 seats away from me.... hee hee  I hear:   The radio in the Career Center.... gotta love the soft rock!   I want:   Some JUCIE!!  I am:   wishing that 3 months and 34 days would hurry up.... I mean Lent isn't over yet.. but I am kinda needing  some .... hahaha  I'm write more when I get home from work tonight.... providing I am well enough to go!... I wonder.... who will be working tonight....

      Courtney is complaining that I am neglecting my blog... so HERE I am showing it some love.    I have stupid broncitious and it hurts like a bitch! Danielle has strep and Courtney has a cold.. so we are doing just GREAT!   This weekend was alright, I didn't really do much, work and sleep. I hung out with Courtney a bit too. Watched some good movies. I had her mom take care of me.  Courtney played suzzie homemaker and made some KICK ASS spaghetti! I talked to my darling LOVER and he loves me! He told me he talks about me to everyone.  That makes me feel so amazing. It is undescribable... I feel like nothing is more important to him, it is.... I can't even talk I am speechless when it comes to my feelings for him.  3 MONTHS AND 36 DAYS!  love you babe!    Today was a really funny day!  First:  at lunch 6 of us pilled into Niki's car to go visit Danielle, but she wasn't home. And for the Record.... I did NOT enjoy having Rhys's crotch that close to me! EEK!  Second:  We skipped last block and went to Piper's.  Damn Seagulls! Then I got to drive Jenn's car! Then she drove and me and Courtney rode on the back.... HOLD ON TIGHT! ahahaha  Third:  Courtney, Lydia and I went down to the water front today after school. We saw some really yummy skater boys, and the best part... WE SAW BRANDON! He's soooo cute! Then we swang on swings and talked about sex, like we would talk about anything else.. hahaha!  I hate being sick.... GO AWAY GERMS GO AWAY!   I see:  my cute yellow jammy pants   I hear:  Fear Factor Sibling  I want:  To stop coughing and sounding like a dog.. bark bark bark  I am:  sick and tired and need sleep but am waiting for my love to come on line...... HURRY UP HUNNY!

       "....i got this one gift from this sexy beotch, I think she likes me, i don't know if she knows or not, but i like her too. she really put some thought into my gift and well it shows me how much she cares...."   Yeah, he liked his present I got him!   Tonight was another lame one.... I am starting to notice a trend... and because msn isn't working, I have  NOTHING TO DO .  Yeah my world is ending. So yeah... what did I do? Well aside from sitting on my ever growing ass I had a SWEET ASS  BUBBLE BATH  (removing unwanted hair, from unwatned places..... yeah I know..... TOO MUCH INFO) It was relaxing. Then after dinner I got back on the computer... wow  LAME ! Talked on the phone a bit and wrote in my journal... only to get back on the computer! Please Mr. Webster when you take my photo at least let me look cute.. that way I can be cute and lame.  Tomorrow is  MOVIE NIGHT .... Gonna be awesome! (Hey Coreena.. Fancy seeing you here... hahaha well at least now I don't have to hear you pee!)  But the reason I came back on the computer was to talk to my ROBBIE ROB and well.. he is not online.. as it is almost 3 am there, I can understand that, so I think I may actually retire to bed BEFORE MIDNIGHT! HOLY SHIT! yes darlings BEFORE MIDNIGHT!  Oh and I have come to the conclusion that I need to EXPAND my VOCABULARY.... I always end up saying the same shit about the same shit.... so if you have any good words.... large words.... ones that will make me sound smart... TELL ME WHAT THEY ARE!   I see:  song list for c.d. I want to burn...  too tired   I hear:   Linkin Park.. Hybrid Theory  I want:  To take one very kick ass road trip with my 2 best friends this summer   I am:  talking on msn... it is now working.... but Rob is still not on.. so going to bed

      Well tonight was pretty darn lame, I stayed home, worked on the blog, hung out, took a nap and had a chat with my aunt. It was good. I looked at prices for going back to Ontario. Why you may ask, Cause Danielle and Courtney are coming with me! I can't wait. I think Danielle is coming for a holiday, but I think Courtney may want to stay.  Either way, I am glad, it will make the fact that I am leaving my HOME and going back less SCARY. We are taking a ROAD TRIP!!! It's gonna be soo cool! It will be 3 sexy high school grads on a bus for 3 days! Can we say FUN TIMES?? Yes yes! hahaha  In all the shit that has happened in the past 2 days, I have learned this:  1.  Lying gets you NO WHERE. If something that happens, tell the person RIGHT AWAY cause yes, it may get you into trouble or you may hurt that person, but it will less severe then if you wait.  2.  In every bad situation there is something good, you just need to find it.  3.  In all relationships you need to remember the good things about it, you be happier that way and it will help you get over the sense of loss.   It is now 12 midnight, and I am going to bed... this is early for me. No more late night chats, no more msn till 3 in the morning.... I can't do it anymore, I JUST GET SICK due to LACK OF SLEEP!  Night y'all    I see:  pictures on my computer  I hear:  My family having a discussion....  weird hours for family chats.....   I want:  food of some kind.. but I am not sure what  I am:  well besides  beautiful .... hahaha VERY TIRED!

       Mondays are great!   I had school today and was dead tired.. but NO ONE can ruin the happiness I am feeling!  Rob is getting a web cam.. which means I  FINALLY  get to look into his eyes and see him! I am sooo excited!  I cleaned the bathroom and am doing laundry and I am grinning from ear to ear and I just can't stop! Love is a wonderful thing!   Presents in the mail are great too! I love mailing them... the anticipation of it all is the coolest feeling! I just hope he loves it!   I love you! xoxoxoxoxo

      I had this dream last night about my sister... Marnie at 13.... kinda scary to see in your head. She was at my house, in my bed, and we were talking. I remember her saying, "I may not be  baby anymore, but can I still curl up with you?" So I let her, and we kept talking about everything. Kaylee was there too... in the hallway, in another room... 19/20ish and completely drunk. I think my sister was talking to whom ever my lover was. My mother was there, though I never saw her, I could hear her voice telling me that it was all my fault, (and that was enough!) but then I walked my very pregnant self out of my very BIG bed to tell her to leave my house and that my sisters were staying. I have no idea where my brother Zack was in all of this... I am assuming he would have been 14... And 14 year old boys and family stuff.... Um doubt it. The question is why were they at my house, who did I live with? Why in God's name was I pregnant? Where was my lover.. Who was my lover? It was weird watch a conversation with your future self and your sisters in the future. Strange brain I have, well I guess this one is better then the time I dreamt about marshmallows.....

      I am still laughing about it. Ok granted it was mean to play a trick on her, but it was still funny at the time. Stayed at....... Last night. My aunt was mad at me, so I figured I would give her sometime to cool off, mostly I just had to get out of that house. I have only 70-something days left before I return to Ontario... and somehow I find myself screwing up the one good thing I have. Why is that? I have no idea. It is a cycle with me... it goes well... oh that's good... let's make it bad.... I have noticed I do this.. now I just need to find the way to  STOP IT ! Didn't do much last night.... but it was still fun. I stayed in bed this morning... well not my bed.. but   NOT THE POINT  ! I should have gone to english, I said aww FUCK IT! To be completely honest.. school doesn't even mean anything to me anymore. I have so much shit in my head, that the things that should be important... aren't. I dunno. When things get bad.. I want to run away and just go back to Ontario... but then when things are good I want to stay and  NOT  leave.  I am lost in this state of confusion.  Nothing in my life makes sense anymore. I know where my heart is, and I know who it is with, but as in location.... Geographically....  NO IDEA . I need to make my aunt realize that I am doing this to hurt her, that I am not screwing up as an attack on her. I am getting in shit for small stupid stuff that I am forgetting, stuff I should  NOT  be forgetting.. but why am I forgetting them? I have  NO IDEA .. I just am. The good thing is I have to work almost all weekend! Then next week I have 27 hours! YES I am soo excited... only one problem... money to get to and from work. I dunno.. maybe I will hitch hike! I sometimes want to scream and yell and tell  everyone ... yes  EVERYONE  to just leave me alone for 2 whole days.. and just lay in bed and not even move..  just cry until I cannot cry anymore.  I think that would help. Oh and Rob talked to my sister... and he won't show me the conversation.... he wasn't even supposed to tell me that much... well if you weren't.. than why did you? Cause knowing hurts just as much as not knowing! But yeah.. I am in class so I should probably be doing work....  OH WELL!    **Hey Coreena... when is that thing this friday? Cause I wanna come..... let me know**    Later Dudes!

       I want to fast forward 18 days, and then hit pause as if I could freeze time, allowing me to stay suspended in a fairytale. I am in a slump, one that I am hiding well behind a smile and a giggle. I want someone to know... to really know me. I want you to look into my eyes and be able to just know. I wanted it to rain more today... I wanted to be rained down on, feeling the cold raindrops on my face, it makes me feel alive, it's moving. I just want to feel your skin on mine, touching me, waking me from this dream, every sensation, every nerve, every movement. I crave you. The touch of your finger tips, the smell of your hair, the taste of your kiss, that look in your eyes when I see you looking at me. Sometimes, just before I fall asleep I can almost feel you here. Then I fall into that same dream of you and me. I love that dream.

      So yeah I am taking the time to really write on my blog. GOOO ME! Welll to those who said prom was over-rated.. THEY LIED! I loved it, and every second of it was worth it! I think it depends entirely on who you go with and who your friends are. (Yes Courtney it would have been better with you there too!) But Brian was hilairous! He dances like NO OTHER! hahaha and Alex and Erin... Good Lord. Josh came too which was cool to see him all dressed up. So by the end of the night I was wearing only HALF my dress and a tie! oh and I kissed Danielle. I have told the story of how much fun I had, and who said what a million times already.. But I thought I would write it too! So after prom.. there are parties... Tracey had a get together at Ryan's... where I managed to go get McDonald's and the FALL ASLEEP! Yeah I missed all the good stuff... hahaha oh well I was soooo TIRED!  Sunday night was Margarita night.. to hear all the details you can read Danielle, or Courtney's or even Coreena's blog! I had fun... up until Danielle puked and I held the bucket and cleaned up the bed she puked on!! But it was funny! Drunk Nat - Now I am Mom Mode.... lol! Coreena, Danielle and I shared some love in the tub. I shared some love with Caitlin of the sofa.... (y'all is soo hot.. haha) But tonight I wasn't the one kissing ANYONE! Yeah me!! Danielle cheated on me! But it was fun.... especially riding my bicycle home!   There are many things I am am afarid of, and scared to do, places to leave and places to go, but the one thing I am sure of is coming home to you. Please do not think that I am sacrificing my happiness to be with you.. cause I am not. You are the reason for my happiness. And yes BC has been better to me... but that is not the point.... I am happy whereever YOU are... and nothng is gonna change that.    I got a letter today!   "Some nights I lay in my bed, just like tonight and I can feel you with me.... Not saying a word, even though we both know what the other is thinking about..."   I love you babe!

      Prom is tomorrow.... I hope it is goona be fun.. that is all I ask.  Rob gets here May 14th..... yeah 3 weeks today.... Oh God I think I am giving myself an ulcer thinking about it. But I am so excited to see him, scared to yes, but tres excited.   Leafs played last night.... but becuase Calgary was playing at the same time and I am out on the West Coast.... I had to watch the Calgary game, not the Leaf game.... which is alright I guess.. considering my Leafs lost.. and that makes me sad. But Philly is a good team.. so... I still have Bragging rights.. They made it farther then the Damn Canucks!  Today is a crazy day... I have so much to do.... School till 1:40.... Tanning at 2..... Make-up Conseltation at 2:30..... Pick up my dress around 3:30.... then go home and get ready for work to be there for 5:30 - 9:30.... come home... and NOT talk to Rob cause he will be at work... (11-7am his time).... so I won't be talking to him till Saturday evening before I leave to go to Prom.... yeah I think I am getting excited now.. Plus Brian is excited.. which helps... A LOT!   So yeah.. this post was pretty much about nonesense.. but I have to take my mind of things... otherwise I will be thinking to much.. and that right now is not something I want to be doing.  I really miss Jazz.... Rob and I were talking about her.. and all the fun times her and I have had throught the years.. and I miss that...  (sticks in bum.... farting boys on rocks.... the WelFair... where I was a total bitch.... all our inside jokes and sayings... NOT ONE FUNNY, BUT TWO FUNNY... tequilla.. puking in her bathroom... Poor Man's pudding...) I can't wait to go home and just hang out with her again.... (YEAH JAZZ... WE IS GOING TO THE BAR.... SO GET YOUR PARTY SHOES OUT OF THE CLOSET AND DUST THEM OFF!)  Ok... well I am not done enough work for today.. so I guess I will do some now....   ** Hey Martha.... you are so cool..... when I get back.. we will go and do "girl stuff" hahaha and talk about "girl things"** (yeah I said that cause Rob INSTANTLY wonders what the hell I mean.. hahahahaha!)   Maybe Rob can kiddnapp Kaylee and bring her here too... see I should just go... I am still thinking!  ~Loves~  P.S.  This song rocks!    Just Another Day in Paradise    The kids screaming, phone ringing  Dog barking at the mailman bringing  That stack of bills - overdue  Good morning baby, how are you?  Got a half hour, quick shower  Take a drink of milk but the milk's gone sour  My funny face makes you laugh  Twist the top on and I put it back  There goes the washing machine  Baby, don't kick it.  I promise I'll fix it  Long about a million other things   Well, it's ok. It's so nice  It's just another day in paradise  Well, there's no place that  I'd rather be  Well, it's two hearts  And one dream  I wouldn't trade it for anything  And I ask the lord every night  For just another day in paradise   Friday, you're late  Guess we'll never make our dinner date  At the restaurant you start to cry  Baby, we'll just improvise  Well, plan B looks like  Dominoes' pizza in the candle light  Then we'll tippy toe to our room  Make a little love that's overdue  But somebody had a bad dream  Mama and daddy  Can meand my teddy  Come in to sleep in between?   Yeah it's ok. It's so nice.  It's just another day in paradise.  Well, there's no place that  I'd rather be  Well, it's two hearts  And one dream  I wouldn't trade it for anything  And I ask the lord every night  For just another day in paradise   Well, it's ok. It's so nice.  It's just another day in paradise.  Well, there's no place that  I'd rather be  Two hearts  And one dream  I wouldn't trade it for anything  And I ask the lord every night  For just another day in paradise  For just another day in paradise   Well, it's the kids screaming. The phone ringing  Just another day  Well, it's Friday. You're late  Oh yeah, it's just another day in paradise

       "we are the three legs of a tri-pod"   It has been an interesting couple of days.....  I am just to lazy to type it all out... So I will give you point form highlights:  1. ROB BOUGHT HIS TICKET! Thus causing me to throw a fit in the Career Center... And then run home to talk to him 2. I went to the movies with Coreena, Shawna and Tai.... Courtney and Danielle came too.. of course!       ** Coreena is super cool! and there is NOTHING WRONG with sex in a limo... hahaha 3. I am starting to look tanned... My tummy and my bum are NO LONGER deathly pale! Awe the wonders of a tanning bed... yeah I look hot!  4. I have skipped a bunch of class.... and we get report cards today... not a good combo at all.. my aunt is gonna  FREAK ! 5. Work is going really good... transfer here I come! 6. Prom is in 2 days..... am I supposed to be excited? 7. I threw up at work yesterday and had some customer tell Sarah that I was pregnant.... I laughed! 8. Rob and I have spent some really good time on the phone.. We have talked about so much... Yes you would be puking...  (Baby... What do you mean we don't need to be on hold? haha)  YOU LITTLE SHIT! 9. Danielle and slept together for like 10 minutes... then we just lay there and  SNUGGLED ... and talked... 10. The more I think about Rob coming... the more nervous I get... my stomach is hurting right now typing it.. and sleep... I have  NO IDEA  what that is anymore.... I just want him to get here so I can get rid of the anticipation cause it is killing me! 11. I have to put my tent up and scrub it down and air it out... LOL!  That's it...  BORING!  I get to bring my dress home tomorrow after tanning.. I am excited for that.    Friend: Even though we haven't spoke in a while.. I still miss you and want to talk to you.   Well I am gonna do some work now.... damn computer class!

        "I won't ask you to stay, but I won't tell you to leave either."    Talked to my sister yesterday... interesting is my ENTIRE opinion on it.   I am so tired cause I only slept 3 hours last night.. I could  NOT  get comfy! It sucked.. then I was late for class... but my law teacher loves me... so it's  all  good!   30 days till Rob gets here.... OMG... the best part... my "chikas" is coming with me when I go to meet him... Courtney don't let me puke on my shirt.. hahaha   Prom is in 4 days.... I am excited.. but I am mostly just hoping it doesn't suck.   Wow that is everything new in my life... oh and I think I burnt my nipple tanning last night and it hurts!   Movies with Coreena and the Ladysmith gang tonight.. can't wait.. it's gonna kick some ass hardcore!   The best part of this post:  THE CANUCKS LOST   .... THEY ARE OUT!!   hahahaha Now My  LEAFS   better fucking win tonight.. or I will be just as shamed as the Canuck fans.  LEAFS YOU BETTER FUCKING WIN!   Well that is it.... I am getting a new e-mail address this week... I just need to think of something good.... yeppers... that will be 3 e-mail addresses..... oh well.. the new one is only going to IMPORTANT people.. so if you don't get it by friday.. I either don't have it yet... or you aren't important...  MAN   I AM SUCH A BITCH .. hahaha  Later much!

      After the weekend had here in good old Nanaimo I think that it is important that I write on my blog. I celebrated 2 birthdays.. Auntie Alison and Antony. I had the whole weekend off work but did I do anything OVERLY exciting... NOT REALLY. I went to dinner and to a movie... The Punisher... and on Sunday I went down to the waterfront for some girl time and drank so good VOLDKA! Girl time.. That is a VERY IMPORTANT thing in a girl's life. Until this weekend I knew my friends were important and that we had each other's backs but I truly realized how much we need each other.   We need each other in good times to enjoy the  fun  and  smiles . To be there to  tell and talk and to make jokes about it.  When something bad happens to bad mouth him, or make plans to sabotage something, or to bitch about it too, a pillar of support and strength.   Friendship  is an amazing thing. In all my long 19 years (haha) I have come to have many friends... Some I still have, some whom I don't. But in all the friends I have now are probably the  REALIST  set of friends I have ever made. Yes we may fight and we may not speak ALL the time, but no matter what they are still there for me as I am still there for them.  I have treated some of my friends quite badly over the last few months and they know who they are and this is my sincerest apology. My behavior has been completely  UN acceptable. You are so important to me and I need you and I love you  (dew)  I promise to be a better friend and not let this happen  EVER  again... and if for some STUPID reason you find me falling into a bad way..  HIT ME ..  HARD ...  with a purse!  ok to summarize all that:  My B.C. friends rock!  (Danielle, Courtney, Niki, Sarah, and Coreena) No matter what they are there And I cannot even begin to tell them how much I appreciate  EVERYTHING  they do and how much I love them for  EVERYTHING  they are.  Smart, funny, beautiful, independent, strong, brave, shy, emotional, amazing, wonderful  people. They have helped me soo much. Helped me to grow and really find myself and who I am. These are the friendships I never want to loose! I leave for Ontario in  88  days and as the days till my departure dwindle away I get sad for leaving them and I get excited to return to my Ontario friends. I am scared to loose the 2-5-0 and the friendships I have made that inspire me to be a better person and to do the right thing.   So yeah I am a sap.. but you love me...    Courtney, Danielle ... Thanks for allowing me to step into your world and taking me in as your friend. You guys are the bestest friends I could have asked for. You have taught me so much. Everything we have done will be a great memory to tell my grandkids.....   Niki   thanks for being you, you have shown me that it is ok to be emotional and cry. It still makes you a good person.  Sarah  thanks for being my "cousin" and for understanding the boy world just as much.. or as little as I do. Thanks for taking my Tanning bed virginity. And helping me learn the lesson that a cowboy hat doesn't mean he loves you! hahaha  Coreena  though we haven't met (yet) you have been a better friend to me then some of my "best" friends back home. Your listening, the advice, YOU ROCK! You are so many good things... You don't give yourself enough credit!  Well this is long ass.... and I haven't mentioned Rob once yet..... HOLY SHIT! (hunny I love you.. you are so amazing! 31 days till I see your gorgeous face!)   I will someday write about my Ontario friends... When I realize who they are and when they show that they are still there for me. Cause it is pretty hard to call them my friends when they have me blocked.. or don't write me back.. or even FUCKING call me! So yeah... New Queer as Folk is on!!! I LOVE IT!!!  Peace out!

      Courtney and I are talking again.. sorta.. Which is cool.. I have missed her.  I hate school... but I go.. fuck I don't want to talk about that  Things with Rob are going really well.. I feel almost guilty about it.... My friends are hurting and I come home and talk to this guy who.... ok.. I can't even talk about him right now.. It is just not fair.... (I love you Tanker.. I'll see you in May)  Well I am going to go get ready for work.. Considering I have used up half of my computer time... FUCK that means I only get half an hour tonight.. SHITTY!   ROB WRITE ON YOUR BLOG  If everyone understood the meaning of RESPECT, TRUST and LOYALTY we wouldn't have any of these problems... PEOPLE SUCK!

I just read Courtney's blog.. and I guess I could have posted this on her comments... but I know I will end up writing more about this later... so I will do it here... saves me time....     the friend thing .. I don't want to be a jerk.. but it that about me? Cause if it was... a) I wasn't reeming you out.. I was simply defending him... both sides of the picture here..... you make fun of him.. he makes fun of you.. it is FUN! Showing you he was being himself.. and that there was no need to get mad at him... OR ME b) Everything back the way it was... when?? Before me.... well I am working on that.... before what though? Before him? I dunno.... but yes if this was directed at me.. I won't ask... I won't even mention his name to you anymore.... not to be rude but I will add it to the list I am not allowed to mention in front of you.... IF it wasn't for me.... then I am a total idiot, but you knew that.. and ignore that ENTIRE comment.... Hope you guys had fun watching to OC.... it was tres good no?   I just feel like I am no longer your friend... fuck I feel like a lepper or something... go have fun, and yeah don't invite me anywhere.. it's cool, I get it, I understand. So when I am "cool" enough to hang out with you guys after school.... I am assuming my phone will ring... if it doesn't well.. I will think what great friends I used to have.... I just don't seem to understand you anymore.... I get how Jenn used to say she feels left out and it sucks.. well FUCK YEAH it does... But nobody reads this damn thing anymore.. so no worries.... Only 91 more days... and Nat is gone... you guys won't have to try and like me anymore.... Mostly I think it is horseshit how we treat eachother.... way to much drama, no even trust and respect.... but hey.... (and I am gonna get bitched at for this one, I know it) maybe you guys like it that way... I just want to feel like I am important, and that when I do leave.. you guys will care....   FUCK now I am late for law.... DAMNIT! gotta fly

      DAY OFF!  I woke up this morning with the biggest GRIN ever.... I sorta walked around in a daze.. My aunt thought something was wrong because I wasn't really talking... I was THINKING.. yeah a rare thing fro me..... but  ROB IS COMING HERE!  Yeah.. I know... You're thinking march break... but this different. Rob has  NEVER  broken a promise to me, and I don't think he ever will.. and he  PROMISED  me he was coming here! I am so excited and sacred! I haven't seen him in a REALLY LONG time... It is gonna be so CRAZY to watch him walk off the bus to me.... My heart will be beating so fast, I know I will cry!  So yeah I went shopping with my aunt today.. Got a new shirt and a new pair of pants. Then I went to work. Nothing much happened there.. I just talked about Rob.. like always! Sarah was working and that was cool. After work we went to Subway for dinner then we went tanning! I went TANNING! It was so much fun. I got a membership type thing so I can go on a regular basis. I go again on Wednesday... When Rob gets here in May.. I am gonna be so hot! lol... 5 whole days in my backyard in a tent.... HOT DAMN! hahaha well I am off to bed... school tomorrow... Yahoo! Plus I have to meet up with Brian to discuss prom stuff. FUN FUN FUN! My next dress fitting in on Thursday!   nighty night xoxoxox

      I had such a good Easter... It was also my 8 month anniversary being here in BC. I woke up to my aunt, telling me it was treasure hunt time. Then we had breakfast and we got ready to go SWIMMING down at Long lake. I called Rob... he was still sleeping.. Awe muffin! lol... he called me before I left...  There were some special people there. I pushed Antony's friend Dan into the lake! Then I had to jump in or Antony would push me in as a pay back! WE took some funny photos... I am so UNsexy. My aunt and I made this dessert called Sex on the Beach... It is DAMN GOOD! I got a sunburn today.. It is gonna look mighty silly in my prom dress... oh well.. I don't even care. We came home from swimming and took apart our BBQ, we decided that it was a piece of crap and we wanted o buy a new one. So we went to the only open store with BBQ, the "stupid" store. We got a BBQ and a propane tank. Filled up on some propane.... We got slurpees and came home to put together our BBQ. I talked to Rob some more... Had dinner, SANG SOME KAROKEE, had a bubble bath... Talked some more to Rob.... and write on my blog... Almost bed time cause I have to work tomorrow, and I drank a little too much voldka!   Happy Easter y'all xoxoxoox

      I'm feeling inspired to write on here now.. Why I dunno I just am.. Listening to Nick Carter on repeat can do that to me! so yeah.. It's Easter... Jesus rose again on this holiday.... HAPPY EASTER everyone!   the highlights of the last few days include: ** seeing REALLY BIG trees on the way to Tifino ** taking pictures of the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen! ** splashing in FREEZING cold waves with Antony and my aunt on long beach! ** shopping with Niki ** having my first fitting for my prom dress.... I really do look cute in that thing! ** being taken out for dinner in a convertible MUSTANG! ... Thanks Tate ** working on a holiday.... time and a HALF! ** realizing I have fallen in love ** going out for dinner with my family ** going to see "The Girl Next Door"..... so funny! ** finding the song I have loved for years! ** Hitting day number 95!  yeah that's it. Rob wrote on his blog about how do you know when you are in love.. and I commented when I thought you know... so I won't write about it again. But when you do realize it  hits you like a tidal wave, and nothing else matters. I am still not really talking to people are supposed to be my friends, hoping that if I give them the space they need, things will get better. Had some really good chats with Coreena.... that girl totally ROCKS! Well Rob isn't on yet.. so I am going to go to bed now....   Jazz I am trying not to make it like my diary...... but I am just not as intelligent and good at writing as you... so I have to be lame. But hey me being LAME is why Rob loves me... so I guess it works! hahaha  Happy Easter... Happy Birthday today to my mother... Not that she cares.  PEACE OUT

      It's good thing you are sitting down.. cause if you were standing to read this you would FALL TO THE FLOOR! Ready..... ok.. I came to school today EARLY... I was here at 8:00am! Shocking I know, but my english teacher said I could do make up work, so I was here to do it! Yep, that's me, getting things on track! So yeah.. It is 8:27 and I am still in class, waiting now until I have to write my English test.  So it turns out that with Rob's college he will need to move to continue his education because the school in London only does so much. Interesting I said... where are WE moving too. The great thing about love is I don't care where I end up as long as I am with him. Sappy, I know... But it is true!   ....watched "Cheaper By the Dozen" last night. It was funny. No, I DO NOT want 12 kids, but 3 or 4 would be nice. But I must depart because class is starting.  PEACE OUT

      I HAVE THE SMARTEST BOYFRIEND! yeah.. that is right.. HE GOT INTO COLLEGE! I couldn't be more proud! (and scared.. what if he goes off and finds someone prettier then me, not to mention smarter) But I love him.. and I can't wait to spend the best summer of my life with him!  So yeah I have done so much homework the last two days.. I think I might go crazy! I remember why I hate homework..... IT TAKES FOREVER!  But there is nothing exciting going on in my life (besides Rob.. and that makes everyone puke)... so I am gonna go... 99 days... BABE WE HIT DOUBLE DIGITS!  Bye bye!

      so yeah.. I now have a boyfriend again.... he rocks!  But I am failing english.. and I did the right thing and told my aunt.. so I am only allowed 1, yes only 1 hour a night on the computer! It sucks! But it then gives me LOTS of time to do my homework... cause if I don't pass english... I DON'T GRADUATE! I hate the idea of throwing away everything I worked so hard for.   Went to Danielle's band concert tonight.. she was soooo good! mmmmm cupcakes!   So Courtney's Rob called her last night.. and he had the gull to ask about me... ASSHOLE! No wonder Courtney didn't talk to me today!  But I only get an hour... so I want to talk to Rob as much as I can.... so I'll write more tomorrow at school...   NIGHTY NIGHT

      AMAZING DAY! I spent so much time just sitting on my bum in the car.. but it was ok.. with the top part way down I was soo amazed at beautiful this island really is. It is really crazy to not have to even leave your own country to see such beauty. I wanted to shoot form roof tops, and scream in the valleys.. LOOK AT THIS! Then that got me thinking.. What am I doing. Why am I leaving? Couldn't I just go get him and bring him here.. cause this view.. the air.. the waves.. it took my breath away! I was standing in a wave.. freezing my arse off, thinking my poor crotch was probably dead never to be used again.. when it hit me.. BAM... I am in love with him. I mean I knew I thought I was.. but to be out there, competely free, sounded by nothing but beauty and people that love me... I just knew. I wanted to call him.. send him a pigeon if I had to just so I could tell him I do. I wanted to write his name in the sky and send him Savage Garden lyrics. (mostly cause that song was stuck in my head from eariier) I was soo awestruck by everything. I was again inspired by it all. I saw these huge trees, hundreds of years old... REALLY tall... I felt sooo small. I wondered what it was like to be a tree. Just standing in one spot.. watching the world change... I had so many thoughts today.... but I am soo tired it is hard to type... Unless you experience the true wonder that is our country, it is hard to explain... I want to show everyone... have everyone feel that freedom I felt inside the car out on that open road... It really opens your eyes to a lot of things!

      The wind in my hair.. I felt like a runway model.. or a cover girl.. doing a photoshoot with wind! It's amazing how you feel with the wind in your hair... it goes up your neck.. over your face... through your body. I felt free, beautiful, completely liberated... I could go anywhere... be anyone... I wanted. I could go anywhere but home.... or am I already home? Be no one but me, be with anyone but him. Is this where I am supposed to be? Have I done things right? I'm not sure.... but you never really know until you get there. But in questioning my life, my destiny, I become more aware of myself, who I am, what I am doing, and that is a positive thing.  Mostly I just want to feel his arms, have him hold me. I think I need to walk back into the wind.. I think best there, all alone, moving, I find the answers, and then I stop to write them down, and like the wind, they are gone. I find the truth for a brief moment, but before I can grab a hold of it.. it is gone.  I've noticed today that I am inspired by the people in my life. So many of them are so beautiful, inside and out. I see things in them that I am hoping they see in me. Independence, beauty, freedom, hope, faith, respect, honor, fear, love..... A spirit that is so moving, a drive in life, a passion to succeed. I think we too often take people for granted in our lives... and that we need to stop once in awhile and realize how amazing our family, our friends, the people in our lives really are. They too are changing, becoming better people, better friends, family, lovers... and if we don't encourage this growth.. they will never know that we are proud of them, and are glad to have them around.   That is my goal... to have my friends, my loved ones, know that I am so proud to know them and have them in my life. I guess hearing Rob talk about having my back really got me thinking, then Danielle wrote something moving, I just needed to tell you that I got your back... I am only ever a phone call away... don't be afraid to ask.... Don't be afraid to be just be you.... Because you are worth it to me.

ROAD TRIP to see the surfers! Well mostly I am going to see the view... the ocean and the waves... I LOVE WAVES! I can't wait. But I must go... let the walking begin!   Hoping he comes online tonight around 11:30.. so he can tell me I am important and then I can go to bed!

      We are taking the time to learn the little things so our arguments aren't so bad, or so often! It is funny to look back at the things we argue over. But love gets us through it all.  **I got your back babe!**   Heard Coreena's party was a blast.. Wish I could have been there  Gotta go shower so Danielle and I can go out.. We are so lame and we love it!  I am soo pissed off at the world right now I could shoot someone. I would like to thank the world for FUCKING UP MY WEEKEND! Man I need to get a new life, and get laid and go back to work.. cause I am UNHAPPY! ....DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT!   Watching Danielle prance around in her boxers makes the day sooo much better!  LATER DUDES!

      Second post of the day. Only difference is now I ahve slept. That one was before I went to bed. I am supposed to learn to keep things to myself... so that kind of defeats the purpose of this does it not? Well aren't' I just the open book of life! haha And I don't write   EVERYTHING   on here.... Just somethings...   So all about today: (be prepared this is long!)  Danielle went home sick today... I hope she took her vitamins. I skipped CAPP, to be honest it was way to early to get up and since my aunt is still nursing my broken heart, I got away with it! Courtney, Jenn and I went out for lunch.. Good old Taco Time! Then we came back, went to english.. where I actually have a part in the story now... WOW a whole 2 lines! After all 2 classes that I went today.. It was hometime! I was home by 1, chores done by 2 and then.. Of course I was on the computer.. but no one was on.. Shitty!  Speaking of my broken heart, we said some things last night that we aren't supposed to say. Yes they are true and come straight from the depths of our hearts, but in saying these things we aren't making it any easier on ourselves. To quote my self  "we're insane"    So yeah.. Prom is in less then a month. I still have so much crap to do. I mean my prom date doesn't even have his tux yet I don't think. We should probably get on that eh?   I talked to my Aunt Gloria last night. She gave me the whole  "what-are-you-doing-after-highschool"   speech. When she found out I'm not going to college she thought I meant for a year or 2. Nope I mean I don't think I want to go ..... AT ALL. I hate school, why would I wanna spend even MORE time there? and have to spend money on it.. Money I don't have.. No thanks. I told her I wanna work, travel, see the world, fall in love and be Happy. Apparently I can do all of that and go to college part time.  "um.. Aunt Gloria, I just don't think I am the college material."   Plus my cousin Amie just got accepted to 2 really good universities.... SO PROUD... so I kind of have to compete with that cause we are the same age. Also my cousin Trena is about to get her master's..... That's what happened to all the smart genes. I just happened to get stuck with the bottom of the barrel.. Slim pickin's for me!  I got an e-mail from my mother today. I believe that woman only writes me when she is grumpy or pissed off. Apparently now I don't know truth from lies and I don't love her. Whatever. I sent her a doozie of an e-mail back. I am not going to let her ruin my life (just my day) I realize that maybe I am better off without her. I have enough people that care about me that I don't need to worry about her. My daddy, my aunt, my family, my friends....She is the one who is missing out, not me. and for my brother and my sisters, they will realize that I am not the crazy bitch she says I am.. Just crazy! So I can ask he a million and a half times to forgive me, it won't happen.  So yeah.. I made Rob a blog.. I got skills! I still need to give him a really cool template, maybe I'll just change the colours of the one he's got, cause right now it kinda looks like peas. hahahaha It is weird, but in a good way, to see my name, my REAL name on someone else's blog. but I like it. (** and babe if I had of stayed in K-TOWN, we wouldn't be this close) I am supposed to be going to Coreena's tonight.. but I have no idea how I am getting there... Shawna was supposed to pick me up.. but now she is not.. so my aunt might drive me.. but who knows! I need to party.. This day just SUCKS! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE get better.  And to make my day just a little bit crazier.. I talked to my sister Kaylee today on msn.. that was WEIRD... but really we didn't talk much... just the usual... me talking... asking questions.. her talking around them.. not really saying much of anything.  Well I am grumpy now.. and gonna do something to cheer my up.... YEP THAT'S RIGHT... DANCE IN MY LIVING ROOM!..... ALONE.. Just for COREENA!

      So yeah.... 104 days.....  I came home from school today... and did my chores... got my phone bill... yeah $245 on Rob! Yeah he is worth it... but I don't have $245 dollars! Then I go on msn.... to him getting mad at me. Yeah we had an argument and we are better now.. but it was not cool. And he was mad over little things (sorry babe, but you were!) I mean we were fighting over blogs and msn profiles... but I acted like a mature person.. I think and we sorted through it. Love is a weird thing.... but I couldn't be without it! I LOVE YOU BABE!   So yeah.... on to better things: the highlights of my evening include a bike ride with Tanya (wearing my sexy  helmet,  (eh Courtney eh??) a bubble bath, making Rob a blog and having some guy ask me to get naked over my web cam (I didn't... just so you know!) so yeah.. now that I am OFFICIALLY the lamest person alive.. I am gonna go to bed.... Need a good sleep for TOMORROW NIGHT!   Night y'all

      Today was interesting. APRIL FOOLS! My daddy called this morning at 7 am! FREAK! I was sleeping and thank heavens my aunt didn't wake me up. I didn't speak with him until around 9:30 when I called him back. Plus I got to hear my baby brother in the back ground making cute sounds. SO adorable!  School sucked as usual. I got to law class 10 minutes late, but my teacher loves and me it was no big deal. She asked me how my heart was. After class I found my lock covered in glue or some kind of nasty. It was gross and TRES sticky! Then for lunch Courtney had some kind of stick up her ass and was a total bitch to me (sorry babe, but yah were). Once again I must be be at fault for her "mood" She now appears to be better, now we shall see. Yesterday it was drunkenness, today it was something I am unaware of, so tomorrow maybe I will be Satan! hahaha So we are coming back from lunch and there was a FIRE DRILL! We were worried about being late, then we aren't! I felt like we were driving though a parade. We talked to Josh.. Well mostly we stole his N! and we watched GAYBE (look at him prance.. He is so pretty... "oh I am cold"... hahahaha "My Khakis!")   Tomorrow is FRIDAY... Coreena's party! Shawna is picking me up, and we are gonna get ready together! I am sooo bringing my camera and taking so many pictures! Coreena don't forget our dancing song... We'll shake our booties together! hahahaha awww.. poor Caitlin.... she can shake too.. just not nearly as well.... it's ok Caitlin... you still rock! (I heart you Coreena!)  I am not sure what to think in regards to love. You can spend an entire life time loving one man, but having many lovers. You can compare every guy you ever meet to him and not have them even come close. Then you get a second chance to be with him, but only one problem, you are 5000km away. So even though he loves you, he cannot be with you. He tells you it is for the both of you, it is better now then in the future. I am soo confused. I know in my heart that I he loves me and wants to be with me, but how long do I have to wait?  Forever? Or 105 days until I see him, touch him again. It hurts to be without him, but yet it hurts to be with him because I am still without him.   Hey Courtney have fun with Mr. POP! hahahaha Don't touch it, I still have my purse and I know how do use it! Oh and I really love your OWL EYES!  Danielle don't forget to take your vitamin C! , maybe a double dose on Friday! I think you're coming down with something.....

      I am even more confused... but I am smiling now.... doesn't make sense... I know but that is me. What can I say... I love him and that isn't changing.  Called Coreena today. We talked for 24 minutes! She sounds preppy but doesn't talk preppy if that makes sense. She is cool! Shawna is picking me up on friday and then I am staying at their house! That is so totally RAD! I can't wait! Oh and I heard Caitlin in the background.... something about eyebrows.... haha  Going to Tifino (??) this Sunday.. can't wait! I have never been there! I am just going all over the place this weekend.... what is wrong with me? lol I just living my life and LOVING IT. Gotta see as much of BC as I can... 105 days left! I get to see surfer guys and stuff like that! It's gonna be soo totally tubular.. like yeah dude!  Well I had a nice nap today for like 3 hours.. but I am tired again... so I am going to bed!

      Well it has been forever since I wrote on here, and this shouldn't even count as a post cause it is goona be really short.   Rob is still here, I am the happiest I have ever been, I am talking to my mom again, school is going alright and I am almost done. I have found out some interesting things lately, thus confirming my belief that PEOPLE ARE SHEEP!  That is it. PEACE OUT!

      It's been awhile since I have blogged.. which is strange, even for me, cause I have been known to treat my blog like my diary!   So what is new?   Rob is currently on his way here, he should be in Manitoba sometime today! I am sooo excited, the scared feelings have subsided for now, and I am just smiling and giddy! He called me 3 times yesterday... From Sudbury, Sue Salt Marie and from some hicktown. He sounds like he is having a great time! Which I am glad, cause I was scared that he would be miserable. AND HE DIDN'T GET LOST! Good job baby... good job!  I could fill this post with NEW INFORMATION about my brothers and sisters... CAUSE I HAVE INFORMATION! FROM MY MOTHER!!! Yes, I have been e-mailing my mother, and her me. It is CRAZY! I am not sure what to think about it yet. I am cautious, but completely willing to give it my all and start a relationship with her. I miss her. Plus the best part... with her comes MY SIBLINGS! Yeah!!!  *jumps up and down like a crzy person*  I am still in shock... It is just unbelieveable. I just need to becareful that she doesn't have alternate motives behind all this.   Um.. I got my hair cut, it now sits at my shoulders and does this cute flip thing. I am not sure if I like it yet. it isn't a huge change, but I did get alomst 6 inches taken off the back!   I have done nothing but work NON STOP.... mostly because I have booked off 4 days in a row for when Rob gets here. I want to spend so much time with him!    Living in a tent ROCKS! More then you could believe!   I'm out.. write more later... PEACE HOMIES!

      I can't believe I forgot to write about the night I had with Courtney! Sunday night we got together so she could show me her new haircut... which looks SO GOOD and we went for hot chocolate. We ended up back at my house, and we thought we had no school.. STRIKE... so we had a few beers. I spent way too long on the phone, but she understood. YEAH BEER ON SUNDAY!  YEAH WATCHING ZOOLANDER!   I saw  Man on Fire  today afterschool. It was such a good movie. I cried through most of it. I was just so swept away by the storyline, and that little girl is such a good actress!  I talked to my daddy today and my step mom for almost 2 hours! It was really good. I am so close with both of them now, closer then ever before!  My leafs are out... please don't talk about it.... it makes me VERY SAD.  I had a good chat with Jazz today... we haven't talked in a while, and I missed her.   Living in a tent ROCKS! Rob will be here in 10 days... I am soo excited. We have some things to work on.... but the love is there, as well as trust and respect, so we will continue to chat and communicate like we do and we will be just fine. I love him. And it is hard with any new relationship trying to take 2 lives and live them as 1 life. Not to mention distance.... but I think are doing great considering.... and in 72 days when I am living in the same town as him, it will be AMAZING!  and that crush.. it is done.  well I am tried.. so I am off to bed.... NIGHT NIGHT

        "There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how..."    Last night it rained... and as I lay there in my tent.. listening to the pitter patter of the raindrops over head, I felt free, I felt washed of my feelings and my emoitions. I loved being outside with the bugs (who were NOT in my tent) with nothing around me but my bear, and my blanket and the vast openess of what is to come in my life. On most nights I put on headphones and fall into a peacful slumber, lost in a dream world. Last night, there were no dreams and no headphones, just total sleep. I woke up and my first thought was him, and to call him or not to call him. and this is why:   We have fought... A lot for the last few days. I questioned why. I thought it was my fault. That maybe I wasn't good enough, or I was doing something wrong. Maybe I was reading into things and maybe it was all in my head, exaggerated by my brain, and be me being a girl. But whatever reason I may have thought, or excuses he told me, the weren't the truth. They weren't the real reason. I would have rather them been.   "I miss her."   I knew something was wrong with us. She has e-mailed him, and yes, being the nosy girlfriend that I am, I have read them. Don't judge me on that. She has nothing better to do then put me down. I could say so many mean things about her, but I am better then that, I know that. I know they confused him. And last night they talked on the phone. She called him.   I want to scream:  THAT IS MY GOD DAMNED BOYFRIEND.    And now he tells me:   "I want to be with you.. I love you... I can see myself marrying you, I can see myself marrying her too, that is the problem."     Just how do I respond to that? He wants to know if I want a break.  I want to  scream  and  yell  and  cry  and then  sob . But I don't want us to break up. I want us to be together. God I am such a girl. So emotional.   I cannot hate him.  I don't know how too. No matter what he says, or how much he hurts me, I still love him and want to be with him. I hear him cry and even though I too am crying I want nothing more then to fix his pain.    Fuck I would do anything for him.    Maybe that isn't what he wants.  I feel second best to her.  I hate the he makes me feel vulnerable. I have a wall around my heart, one that has been put there to protect myself, and allows me to get what I want physically but not emotionally. Rob has got around that wall. Sometimes I love that, sometimes I hate that. My heart is hurting, and I know when he reads this it will hurt him and I am almost tempted to not write this at all, but I have to get it off my chest.   I fucking e-mailed HER. I told her to go and  SPEND TIME WITH MY BOYFRIEND!    I can't be in his life anymore unless I am with him. I know that hurt him, but it is the truth. I want him to be able and look me in the eyes and tell me he doesn't love her. Until then I know he does. That may be selfish and I can almost hear Jazz saying he will always love her... Yeah well he doesn't have to love her like that. I can't be friends with him anymore. And I am so scared that he will choose her. My heart almost knows that he will.   And everything I had dreamed will be gone.  POOF  Gone in a cloud of smoke. The hardest part of all this:   He is coming here in 11 days.    I am writing this in the Career Center at school.  WHY?  Because I walked into law class and when my teacher asked me how my weekend was and if I am excited about my boyfriend coming to visit, I said nothing but  broke into tears , so she sent me to the library because she didn't think I needed to be in class.  God bless the heart of Mrs. Moslin!   I am not mad, not at him anyways. And I don't want her to tell him she doesn't love him, and that she doesn't want to be with him.  I want her to tell him she does love him and that she wants to be with him.  That way he  REALLY  has to choose. Otherwise he ends up with me by default, and I will never know if that it what he really wants.

      Work was sooooooo long, I didn't think it would ever end. But I made my day, and that is what matters. So I get another GOLD DOT... one step closer to my transfer!  Supposed to have TENT NIGHT tonight, but my friends are going to Mark's. So yeah I hope they have fun.. I'll be home.. sick... maybe I will sleep!  The tent is offically up. Danielle and I put it up yesterday afterschool. I think I may sleep in it until I leave in July. I love it!  We are a team, I love you and when you hurt, I hurt. I've got your back, and I am not going anywhere. I would love to kick her ass, but that wouldn't solve anything!  I'm being transformed.  I have a crush, and don't know what to do with it.....   Ok.. the head is pounding... going to take a hot bath now and try and clear out my nasal passages.

      Well I wrote on here yesterday and the damn post didn't show up, so here I go again! So much has happened in the last little while, so I shall summarize.   #1.  I am still talking to my mother. I am shocked, and even though I don't know where she is at this time, she still is e-mailing me. Shocking!   #2.  My sister Kaylee is moving in with me. She had a falling out with my mother and now is going to stay with me. I have no idea how to take care of me, let alone a 16 year-old girl. It's gonna be tough, but I'll handle it!   #3.  Rob and I are doing great. We have had a few minor bumps the last few days, but it was nothing we couldn't over come. We actually set our wedding date. October 7th 2006. Yep book it in your calendars Ladies, it's party time!   #4.  I am leaving BC in 26 days. I am sad to leave, but excited to return to Ontario to see everyone. I am sad to leave my friends here.    I  want to say thank you to  Courtney and Danielle  for making this year so great. Yes we have had our moments where we wanted to kill each other, but they were brief, and we grew stronger together through it all. Thank you for being the realist friends I have ever had. You 2 are so beautiful inside and out, you have so much life and passion (yes even Courtney when she is frowning) you guys have taught me so much, and helped me find me way to who I am. Thank you for helping me find my voice and that brave-side that lets me take pictures of guys bums. Thank you for all the support and the chats where I have done nothing but cry, and visa versa. Thank you for letting me into your world and making me a part of it. I love you both so much, and I hope we manage to stay this close. Follow your dreams and always hold you heads up. You are worth it! Remember that always! And no matter what I am just an e-mail away! I shall see you at my wedding, where we shall get hammered and cry over the good old times hahaha and I will be there when Courtney marries John.(and Bryan Adams plays at her wedding)    We are the 3 legs of a tri-pod!    Coreena and Shawna , you guys are great. Thanks for all the chats on msn, the listening and the advice. I am so grateful for you two. You guys better come visit before I leave, or I will be PISSED! Keep in touch, I wanna know what happens in your lives. When Coreena does something wonderful, when Shawna gets married, I wanna be there for that, like you'll be there for me.  To all the other friends I have made here, (you know who you are) I love and espect you too! Thanks for an awesome year, and keep in touch! You are important to me, and I want to here about your lives!  Going home is going to be interesting, becuase at this point I am not sure who my friends are. Is the the people I considered my best friends who have done shit to stay in touch. Not even a lousy phone call or e-mail?  Guess not.  Is it the so called friend who claims to be looking out for me, but deep down may be trying to ruin my realtionship?  Don't think so.  What about the person who claimed to be my sister, we were so close, and then when I needed he the most let JEALOUSY get in the way of our friendship and walked away?  Hmm, guess not her either.  It shall be interesting to see who my friends are when I get back. The answer is no, I am NOT bringing BC bud back with me, so don't even ask. I am not even sure if I want these people in my life after the fact that they have treated me like shit for the past 11 months.   I get it! Your reason: I am out here, you are there.   Well that is fucking shitty. A letter in response to my letters, isn't that hard. A fucking stamp costs 52 frigging cents! Think about it.   #5.  I am switching Bootleggers! I found out yesterday that I will have a job when I get home! YES!!! GOOOOOO ME! it will only be part time for the first bit, but that is ok, once I WOW them with my selling skills I'll be bumped up! YEAH!   #6.  Grad Campout was Tuesday night, OMG, what a blast! Danielle... Erin - what a night!Too many "man-ginas" for me, but whatever! Rode in a car with some guy I don't know... but it was cool. Richard hubber drove us down the hill, apparently this is a big deal. I dunno. Power to Bon Fires! I had sooo much fun, a little too much, that by the time the bad shit happened, I was too hammered to be sypathetic. My only comment: She shouldn't have moved her car there. I came home around 2:30 and spent the next day lying on my bathroom floor next to the toilet.  I HATE PUKING!  But it was fun!   #7.  I AM GRADUATING! enough said... it is about freaking time!  That's it.. I am done.... I will write more soon, I promise to stop neglecting my blog. I will love it more. hahahaha  Peace Out

      He left yesterday. I can't stop thinking about him. I want him to come back.  Talking to my mom and sisters again! I am the happiest I have been in a long time.  Grad is soon. I am so worried about it, but not at the same time. I just want to finish it.  My biggest fear right now is if I am gonna be able to fly home.... I hate MONEY and everything about it. I might have to bus home. Maybe my amazing boyfriend will pick me up somewhere along the way.... I HOPE!  that's it. that's all

      I sit here typping this, barley able to sit in the chair because it hurts. Damn kidney infection again. Lying in bed yesterday after work, I knew I had a bladder infection... another damn UTI... cause it hurt to pee. Then after one of many trips to the toilet my right kidney started to hurt. Out of no where. Fuck. So I thought it was nothing I will go to the doctors tomorrow. Well in lying in bed... the pain got really bad.... to the point of tears. Rob was worried, did the guy thing and got upset.   "Why did you let this happen?....   I'm not getting mad at you, awww come here.. I hate to see you in pain.   You know I would do anything to take it away."

      Well I am home. The first week was really hard.... I cried a lot. I was really homesick. I still am but it is getting better! Things here have been good..... here is my summary!   I came home to Rob... who was waiting at the airport for me... with a pink rose.... my favourite... and I fell in love with him again... right there and then. We are doing awesome and I love him more then ever! I know in my heart... like I always have&nbsp;that he will be my fairytale.. that he is my fairytale. I am staying with him until I move into my townhouse with Tania. His family has been awesome, it is like I have always been a part of this family! I love it! I spent 6 days at his family cottage... that was so much fun. I am so tanned... ok not really but I am really tanned for me! I got to drive a boat and meet a bunch of his family... that was cool.&nbsp;   My friends out here have been less then adiquate.... to be honest... I&nbsp;wouldn't even call them friends! I haven't seen any of them... except one and that was by accident.. because I work at the mall.... So yeah... I miss my BC friends like crazy! The walks.... talks... girl times... all of it! They are  UN-REPLACABLE!  It is a good thing I have Rob and his friends... cause otherwise I would be a big time LOSER! hahaha   My family has been cool. It is awesome to see my baby brother again. Cody is the cutest thing ever! I am close with my dad.... again, and so close with my step mom now which rocks! As for my sister Kaylee... um... not so much.. in the first 3 days I had been home we argued and then got in a fist fight... which I am HAPPY to say I kicked her ass! I know that is pathetic... but I don't care! I haven't really seen anyone else.... my aunt Cathy and her kids.... but that is it. To be honest I don't care.   Work is going good.... it is not the same... my old store was waaaaaay better... but of course I will think that. I work with some really nice people and I am making my goals and that is all that matters.   So yeah... I am tired... back on Ontario schedule.... and I must work at 9:30am! BASTARDS! So that is all for now..... Rob and I had our anniversary&nbsp;on&nbsp;Wednesday... it was the most romantic date of my life! So much fun!&nbsp; I must go..... Good night all.... and do keep in touch! LOVE YOU ALL!     NAT ATTACK signing out!  &nbsp;

      as I sit here, nervous as hell, watching my last few days, hours, minutes dwindle away I think about everything I am leaving behind, and everything I am going back too.  I am leaving my home, the family I have known for the last year, and the friends who have helped me find myself and help to make me a better me.  My  Auntie A  and my awesome cousin  Tone , it will be hard to leave them, knowing everything they have done for me. I cannot thank them enough or even attempt to repay them for what they have done. I will be back! And they will always be my favourite people!   My friends  The things they have done I can't even put into words how much they mean to me. I know they aren't ready to have me leave, and if it were up to some they were chain me to trees... lol I want them to know that this is not goodbye... it will never be goodbye. I will be back, and our friendships will remain true, that is my promise to you. Danielle and Courtney, do not be angry for me leaving early.. it was my decision, and I am excited to go back to the east. I hate leaving you guys, but it was not for a boy and not for other reasons other than my own to go. You guys have helped me realize that living my dreams are more important then making other people happy. I love you guys so much, never forget that. I will miss you and you better keep in touch or I will come back just to hit you with my purse! (I'll hit you with my purse... you better be having some fun out here with guys... hahaha) To Coreena and all my other friends out here, you guys have made a huge difference in my life and I love you all! You better keep in touch or I will kick your ass!  I am crying now at the thought of leaving everyone....  But at the same time I am thinking about what I am going home too.... my family: my daddy, my sisters, my brothers, all my aunts and cousins! To my boyfriend, who is awesome! All his family, who apparently can't wait to see me, and/or meet me! To all my friends, though some have had a hard time keeping in touch, I know that they are excited to see me too! To my new roomate Tania, I can't wait to see her either! I will have an awesome summer. It is gonna be great!   So this is my see-ya later to the people out here whom I love dearly and will miss lots, but no worries.... the NAT ATTACK WILL BE BACK! And hello to everyone I coming back too! Let the party begin!  Sex Machine (hahahaha) signing out!   P.S. I will write on here from time to time while I am in Ontario so my peeps up in herrre (the MO) can know I am doing fine!  xoxoxoxox

      Hello, I realize now why I hate the bus. Don't get me wrong, the idea of public transit is a good thing, but when you stop to consider just who may be sharing the "luxury" of the bus, the idea isn't so great. Rob didn't have a car today, so I had to take the bus. I don't mind the bus, I even feel independant taking it, but having a smelly old man sitting to close, a creepy fat man with an eyebrow ring starring at your chest for 20 minutes and a weird old lady in a wheelchair telling me she is going to run me over... suddenly the 5 minutes it takes to dive to work with Rob in the car feels even more like heaven. (It already does... 5 minutes all alone with my baby.... makes me smile!) I was half an hour late for work, which yes was mostly my fault, but the bus is still toooo slow! So now by this time I have had to ride the bus, and didn't get sex this morning because I slept to late. Then I had to work till midnight. I was GRUMPY! Plus Rob got shit faced tonight, so... sex tonight... that is really amazing and not sloppy... not bloodly likely. (But drunken sex with Rob is still DAMN good!) It's Martha's 21st Birthday today. (August 7th) I know Brad screwed it up already. I wonder if his less then adiquite gift will reedem himself.... doubt it! (For the record... he is passed out inside and Martha is outside.. still partying... without her so called boyfriend) I can't wait for Monday.... I am moving into my condo! Tania is already there living it up... in our condo.. which I found in a day! It amazes me that she looked soo hard and couldn't find a place to live but I look for a couple hours and find a place.... hmm... I dunno, maybe it is timing and atittude. But I love her and we are finally OFFICALLY roomies! Oh and tomorrow I am going out for breakfast with Rob and Shelby. Plus we are unpacking dad's attic to make Monday's moving a little easier. In riding the bus I came to the conclusion that I have no friends. This is okay with me. (Okay... yes I do have friends... they jsut happen to be 5000km away.) Last night after work 3 people whom USED to be my friends were outside... I said a quite awkward hello and that was it. To be honest I want nothing to do with almost all of the people who were my "friend" when I left. Because to be blunt they are assholes. But I must go... Sleep is my friend and I have a long day.. I work from 6 till 1am! Pray Rob gets a car so I can skip the adventure with the scary people! Plus I need sleep cause I am grumpy, stressed out mostly and I am taking it our on Rob, and he is being amazing and taking my shit. Maybe he just knows me well enough to know that I love him more then I can ever say and that I don't mean to hurt him. (I love you baby, and I wish we had of got married last weekend) To those who this.... hope all is well.  Why hasn't Coreena commented lately... maybe she doesn't love me anymore. Big shout outs to Sarah and Courtney... I miss you guys sooo much! Sarah have fun at the lake.... go to the island... play some football! hahahaha Courntey you best get your ass out here and visit me! Big hellos to everyone else who reads this. Hope all is well. I wish you health wealth and happiness! xoxoxox

      I am moving into my own CONDO! I realized that I cannot stay with Rob's parents... for one that would be weird and for 2 they haven't been alone for over 20 years... so why would I ruin that? So in ONE DAY I looked at apartments and got my own condo that very same day! I am moving in on Monday cause that is my only day off! I am excited to live with Tania... and on my own, but scared as hell at the same time because I have never had to be that independant and I am scared of failing! Rob is leaving for school in less then 25 days and i am doing everything to aviod it. I know he isn't going to be that far away but I can't imagine not seeing him everyday. It is going to be hard to not be with him. My dad is on holidays for a week, he took my family with him, including Kaylee. I was supposed to go, but I had to work, so that was that! Things with Kaylee are getting better. We are working on being sisters, not enemies...which is nice cause I hate kicking her ass! haha Work is going well. I am doing a kick ass job! I might be able to go full time... other wise I am going to have to get a new job to be able to pay my rent. I might work at Central (for those in BC... that is a grocery store!) full time.. with Rob's mom, but we shall see. But there is beer here, and it needs to be drunk.. and I vote ME! so I am going to go.. I shall write more later! see y'all I miss thsoe in BC.. and I love y'all lots and I shall see ya soon! xoxoxoxoxox
