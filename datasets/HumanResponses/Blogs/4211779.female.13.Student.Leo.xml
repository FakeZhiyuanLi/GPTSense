I'm bored.Procastinating. :D Bored!I shall complain.      Today's topic: The Bitch.She's actually the housemate.Been here since July.And she's such a BITCH! She curry favours all the people in the house.Except me.I will never fall for her trap.And she opened my drawer once.And took my book and looked at it.Crazy bitch.And she keeps on asking people to 'teach' her to do her homework.Why?Cos' she's DUMB!She just sits there and shakes her leg.Oh yea,before she even 'do' her homework,she looks into the mirror for like,999 minutes?She thinks she's so pretty,yea,pretty ugly.

       Wow!I can't believe I actually revised!For only 1 hour plus though. :D I did my science and Chinese revision.A bit more to go.Yay.Geez,Prelim's next week and I just realised that this Thursday is our compo!So dead!Anyway I have thought of some vows.      I vow to:   - stay faithful to my blog.   - stay faithful to my journal and 'Zhou Ji'.   (Jesslyn's phrase)   - stay faithful to my idols.   - keep fit by playing badminton whenever I can.   - practise piano and guitar whenever I can.   - only use computer for 2 hours a day.   - only watch TV after everything is done.   - do my homework and revisions once I reach home(after bathe).   - show Chimp Lee my potential.   - not give my slaves their salaries.

       Catwoman was nice! I quite like the action and the plot. It was so cool!Okay anyway today I went to the bus-stop to wait for Denny to go to the guitar lesson together.And I waited and waited,but he did not turn up.So I thought he had gone to Kawai already,therefore I went there too.But,he still wasn't there,and the teacher told me to have lesson first. Surprise! Denny came when it was like 1.30p.m,which is the time we end the lesson!!!Urgh!      Okay so I went for my piano lesson after that and went home,duh! And went online for  a while,but nobody was online.So I played badminton for a while.Then me and The Bitch and my maid[Mini-baba]headed to the tennis court to play.But it was occupied.Then,at the playground,there were 2 so cute toddlers!One of them is my neighbour.She's only 1 and a half years old,but she's like 24kg!      Then I read my guitar book for a while and Mom came back.Then bathed and got ready to go to Jesslyn's birthday dinner.And straight to Tony Roma's!Mmm!Anyway after seeing everybody eat disgustingly,I did not eat much.But enough to satisfy my tummy.After that Nicole and I went to the NICE TOILET WITH AIR-CON.And then ate the birthday cake.And then talked for a while.And then headed home with Shinzu.

       Dang!Just came back from Chinese Oral.Didn't know what zebra crossing was in Chinese.Wtf?Anyway let bygones be bygones.Next week'll be English.Hmm,not that scared. XD       Hmm,may be going to Great World City to watch Catwoman with Mom and Charlene.Don't know if the botch is going to come with us.Hope not.Better go buy Jesslyn's present there.If not,*SLASH SLASH*,die again.      Think it's going to be a boring day.*Sigh*Let's complain!1..2..3..GO!      Children,today's topic will be on Ms Lee the Chimp Lee!   Introduction:A stupid Math HOD of RVPS.She is a chimpanzee which has B.O and belongs to the Singapore Zoological Gardens.Perhaps she's A-meng's buddy.She escaped from the zoo a few years back.      Okay enough of the crap.Chimp Lee,(we call her that because she so looks like one,esp. her lips.)is such a freaking biased Math teacher.Why?She(it)only favours boys,just becase she is the Scouts Mistress(which she doesn't deserve to be at all).      Example--Scenario 1:Spencer(a scout)got 74 for his CA1.Chimp Lee said,"How can that be?Come,Sayang,let me see your paper and see if you can get any more marks."So he got 75.   Example--Scenario 2:I got 74 for my SA1(Why?because she's a chimp,that's why.How can a chimp teach?).Chimp Lee said,"How can that be?Come let me see your paper.Aiyah,here lah,told you already you never listen!Bodoh ah!"So i got 75 for being scolded.      That chimp!Don't even know how to communicate properly.She speaks Singlish and acts like she can speak so well.How could I listen properly?She speaks so quickly and lousily.NOT that I did not listen.I want Miss Tan back!Well,she can't teach P6,I think.I want Miss Ang back!

       Aww!Today is Friday the 13th,as Elaine said on her new blog.Tomorrow is PSLE Chinese Oral!!!Can't get that off my mind. >.    Okay,now I revive.I just had Chinese tuition.Same old thing,did some revision.But before that we discussed on some oral pictures.*Sigh*But I'm a little more confident!      Today,Clara has finally remembered to lend me her Ou De Yang[Ocean]CD!His songs are not bad,I must say I quite like them.But the sad thing is,we don't know how he looks like. >.    Uh-oh!My library book is due today!But I haven't got the time to go to the library.Don't even talk about returning it.Anyway I think I have about $2++ fine on my account.Dead again.
