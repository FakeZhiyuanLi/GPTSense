      So then, wonderful world of never-never-land. Let's just see how truly nifty this service's abilities are...the following is the most recent blog from my website...     Creme Soda tastes a lot more like yams than the Popemobile does...   On the date of  2004-07-25 19:00:20   While  the whole Meteora CD  was blaring through my speakers.    Indeed, and the moon is made of I can't believe it's not inedible. Well, anyways, my birthday has passed. It was a rather fun day, my birthday was. Just about everyone told me happy birthday. I even got a call on the phone from kawauso-kun. There were two people who I expected to contact me, but they didn't...but I'm not worried about it. I am sure they had other things on their minds. *glares at the two people* and they know who they are. But let's not dwell on bad things, ok? I've finally brought myself to the conclusion that I will probably never get off my fat ass and convert all my old blogs over onto the archives page. Oh, and I also plan to take down the lynx optimised page, since I realised that the normal page works just as well in lynx anyways. What do you know, I was compliant without even trying.    But then again, maybe I should keep the lynx page just for the sake that the pages are smaller. *shrug* I don't know, but quite frankly it doesn't matter at the moment. Have you ever run scenarios through your head and acted things out to see how you would react if something were to happen? If not, I suggest it to everyone out there. Its kinda fun. Oh, and another thing. If you get in the bath with REALLY hot water, I mean like...you can barely stand to hold your hands in the stream. And leave your arms there for a while, until the skin gets red from being flushed with blood. Your blood flows so freely and is so thin after this that by sucking on your arm, your blood will flow THROUGH your skin. Seriously. I did it. I got three portions on my arms now that look like blood blisters or maybe bruises from it. Like a bruise thats kinda red on the edges. Its an interesting thing. Not to mention its a safer way of drawing ones own blood...in case you feel like doing that.    Masturbation. Why is this so...frowned upon by the general society? Is the whole world one big assed hippocrite? Hello, if you haven't noticed, just about everyone does it. Besides that, since when is it their damn business what you do in your private life? If I want to fucking jack off, not you or your damn momma can say a fucking thing about it. So fuck off. Seriously, earlier today, I was reading this thing online, right? It was a survey. I have a habit of taking these things to waste my time. But anwyays, it asks if you masturbate, and then how often. With this in parenthesis off to the side: "You fucking self pleasing sinner." I realise that this was a joke aimed at Catholics, but damn. Its kinda stupid, isn't it? Who the fuck thought up that sin? "Oh, you can't touch your genitals unless you're having sex with someone or unless you're going to the bathroom." Yeah. Fucking. Right. So fuck off, back off, and if you still want to condemn me for masturbating, come here and I'll shove a dildo down your fucking throat. And I hope you fucking choke on it, too, you little bastard.    Anyways, time for some random words to draw in people from Google. That's right! Shinji's baiting his page for more hits! Its quite simple. Just imagine that everyone out there is a sick, disgusting pervert. If all my talk of masturbation hasn't already lured some of them, this will, because they always search for weird kinds of porn and such. *ahem* Pokemon porn hentai XXX sex-o-rama. Digimon porn, Sakura porn. porn porn porn. sex sex sex! Hot kinky ass fucking cartoon shit!    Now, enough Google baiting. I''ve nothing else to talk about so...yeah.     teh shijni!!!111711ONE1

        Well, I am sure that not many people out there will be reading this, but if you do...then hi. My name is shinji, which is short for saihenjin. Japanese. It means "the extremely odd one". I am the graphics guy for a wonderful little online site called  urlLink Toasterlogic . TL. Yes, shameless plug. I know. My real blogs site is linked to up there, at shinji.toasterlogic.com, but you could see that, couldn't you? Yes, of course you could. Anyways, as a courtesy to my readers, I am doing a review of the Blogger service. And so far, it definitely has my go-ahead. There are only a few things here I dislike, but don't worry. We at Toasterlogic are working on our own blogging service. This is EXTREMELY nice, and I like it more and more with every keystroke. I must pass on the word.    *shinji has given this service three thumbs up, he stole the third from his neighbor.*
