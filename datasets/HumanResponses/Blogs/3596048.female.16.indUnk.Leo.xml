      --Thanks--    Just think about all those things,  That you've done,  To make all those hurt gone,  Thank you for all..   Thanks for being such a nice friend to me..  For helping me through all of my problems..  Thanks for being there when I need you..  For comforting me when I'm really down..   For all that you have done,  Just for me..  You just make me whole and happy..  And for that you are so cool..Ü   Think of those people you light up  And made their day complete..  Maybe being friends with you is just a coincidence..  But after all, this all make a sense..   I'm really happy to have you in my life...  Now, at times when you need me,  Don't hesitate to come to me,  And ask for my help or advice..   I'll always be here for you,  I'll always help you through,  I'll always be your friend..  No matter what happens, I promise..Ü       --Life is Worthless Without You--    I still remember,  since the day I met you..  I told myself,  you're the one I've been looking for..   your my soulmate,  your my life,  and I want to spend my life with you..  a guy who will love me too..   if you only knew,  how much i love you..  if only your here with me..  you'll know how you make me smile..ü   can this happen that you and me will be together?..  can this be true?..  that you'll fall for me too..  or can this be a dream forever?..   I hope time will come,  that you'll love me too..  I promise i'll never give up..  coz life is worthless without you.. ü

      I don't know how long I will love you..  I don't know how long this feeling would last..  I don't know how much love i can give you..  I don't know when will i give up on you..  I don't know if i'll ever leave you..  I don't even know if i could do that..  all i know is as long as there is time and love,  i'll always be here for you..  i'll cherish every moment i'm with you,  coz deep in my heart, i know it's true..  that i love you, i really do..  I know this may end,  you may leave me someday..  but i'll always look back..  on the mem'ries you had left behind..  the happy moments i had with you,  that once in my life you have made me whole..  how you have made me smile..  especially at times when i'm really down,  your there to comfort me and loved me unconditionallly..  I will always remember,  that once in my life i have loved some one like you..  I will always remember,  that once in my life i have learned how to love because of you..  I will always remember,  how precious life is since you came into my life..  I will always remember,  how lovely it could be when you love someone unconditionally..  if only i can love you forever, i will..  but i can't.. coz ya know wat? sometimes,  we just should give up someone so that we could be happy too..  but ya know what? I will never forget you, I PROMISE!ü  coz you were the best i've ever had in my life.  I LOVE YOU, I REALLY DO!!!!!ü
