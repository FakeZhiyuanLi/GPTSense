      yeah today was my 8 month anniversary with michelle. yeah we went to the mall. didnt do anything special walked around and got dinner went shopping and yeah. i bought her a tee shirt and jeans and she bought me a cd. (Beastie Boys- 5Boroughs) good cd! and yeah we went to the movies to finish it off. we saw the the bourne supremacy. good movie! the plot wasnt as good as the first but the stunts made up for it. ^_^ so over all the movie was as good as the first. yeah well I realised again today why I am deeply in love with Michelle. She is such a good person. she is beautiful, understanding, smart, and more than i can ask for. i know ive said this before but i gladdly call Michelle my one and only! and to restate the obvious I LOVE MICHELLE!

      well michelle came over for dinner, and a movie. well this was the first time that i have seen her in a week and a couple of days. as a short of a time that it may seem like i missed her soo much. and my heart was pounding when i first saw her. there is a feeling when you love someone so much and when you havent seen them in a really long time (in this case it was about a week) that you cant describe. it fills you with a warm and fuzzy feeling that sends chills down your spine and well ive come to reallize how much she means to me. and well i never want to let her go, because im prowd to say that she is my one and only.

      well after talking it out for a bit with her i have found that this whole thing was like a really big misunderstanding and well i guess we both have to be more careful on how we express ourselves to each other or at lease give each other the chance to explain what they really meant. one thing that i have really learned is that communication is one of the biggest parts of a relationship and if there isnt any communication then there isnt a relationship.
