       I don't think thats how you really spell delireous, but it's ok...I don't feel like asking Cary how to spell it ;) Anywho, em...last night was interesting. For one, i all of a sudden started feeling really hyper and happy...pretty much delireous. Around 2, i decided to make my bed.   What the hell???   After that i was talking to shayla, and it was like, 2:30, and i decided to wash the dishes...   ???   So after i washed the dishes i went back to the computer, and talked to Kimmers for a while, BTW thank you Kimmy you really helped me with all this shit, so thanks :o)   Ok but that wasn't the point, at like, 3:30 i decided to go in my backyard, my pitch black backyard and just lay there for like, 5 or 6 minutes...   What the hell???   "what you probably remember was more like this: 'doo doo doo doo wa wa wa wa!!'"  -Jurrasic 5

        hehe...i'm sorry this really is my last entry for the day, but i wanted to get this out of my sorry-ass mind...I really don't know what to do about this whole man-person situation...i don't want whats going to happen to happen...but then thats just me i guess, cause no one seems to agree with me about it these days. Anywho, earlyer today i sorta wrote some thoughts...i guess that you could call a poem down in my notebook at drivers ed, atleast it was something to do. It says how i feel lately about this twisted shit...   Desperate to see you fall  just like me  I had done the same to you  you hurt me  just like i had done before  So sorry that i messed things up  So sorry that i hurt you the way i do  So sorry that i took you and me,  so un-sereously  and now that i'd rather have you than anyone  You give me another reason  to run to my red walls  Rejection hurts,  just like everything once did  but the thrill is gone,  and the pain is numb,  and i can't tell you how much i'd rather have you now,  then had given you up at all.  I close my eyes,  and try to forget about how you tripped me  and watched me fall.  Try to forget about what we could have had  if i hadn't have been so selfish, so stupid  i would have realized,  that you are were the only thing  making me smile like i used to  Try to forget about what was better  but memories flood my brain because they would.  So kiss me, the way you used to  when i knew it actually  meant something good.  and shame on me for ever letting myself let you go  Because i know, that you know, that we both know  that together would be better   wouldn't it???

       I found myself in a interesting situation and thought i should just let everyone know that i am a phsyco and usually only really amazing kisses feel like this   I was talking to a friend, who has never kissed anyone before, and he asked me "what does a kiss feel like?" and basically this was the conversation.   Him: What does a kiss feel like?  Me: A kiss is beautiful  Him: Yeah but what does it FEEL like???  Me: A kiss is something that one cannot describe, a kiss feels like sipping water from the mountains of the gods, a kiss is a miracle only to be whitnessed by souls that are ready for such a wonderful experience   I worry about myself sometimes, where does it all come from???

       Ok, this is based on my friends journal entry on MySpace, i hope i don't fuck it up cause i get confused easily...and am a little slow ;o)    About a month ago, I broke things off with my Ex boyfriend lets call him #1. Me and #1 were together not that long at all, about a month, a little less. Yesterday I realized that i still have feelings for him, and that i was ready to be together with him again, and actually start a worth-while relationship, but things just didn't work out that way, so today, i give #1 a proposition to think about things for a little while, and then come back with his answer. Meanwhile, theres boy #2, who i met through school, and a couple weeks ago, we hung out and i found out he thinks of me as a little more than just a friend, at least thats what it seemed like. I still keep in touch with #2, but we haven't hung out really since that night a couple weeks ago, and i don't think he would want to start a relationship with me, it seems like just a fling.   Just when i thought confusion would blow my brain and heart to peices, boy #4 calls me earlyer tonight, and cracks me up, and makes me smile more than i have in a while. Now ofcourse #4 and I are stricktly friends, and we have always been that way, we have liked each other before, many random times, but he is one of my soulmates, and to have a relationship with him would ruin our connection, i've known him for about 2 and a half years now, and i love him very much, he helps me through EVERYTHING,which i am more than greatful for.   For now, thats about it...I will inform you with what ends up ending up in the end...lol no wonder why i am so confused, because all i say is so confusing. I will stop talking...hehe...Tata

        This poem was done a matter of months ago. I can't remember what inspired it, but it was basically a feeling i had inside of me that needed to be let out for a long time, it is one of my only favorite peices of mine, I hope you like it.   21 Grams   Hold your breath and take it  While your on your way down  like a drug  Making your body heavier  and all you can think is  I hope i don't drown  You look to your left,  Darkness  You look to your right,  Blackness  you look towards you  and realize that theres no one there  to hold your hand  Your alone but your crowded,  Something you know you can't stand  The hour goes by in slow motion  The minute ticks in time  mesmerising you in its only detection  The seconds sting your skin,  Like the razor blade your tears hit  as you looked at your reflection  So you ask yourself,  How could you be so meaningless  you ask yourself why?  21 Grams later, you didn't even say  Goodbye  -Heather L. Green

      I am going to start titling my posts with the songs i am listening to at the moment, why? i don't know.  But oh well.   I haven't posted in a long time, and a lot has happened since i have, so lets talk a little shall we.  The guy situation is a little interesting.  I was trying to get over someone a couple weeks ago, and so i was just waiting to see if another guy would show up MAYBE because me getting my hopes up about that kind of thing is a little crazy and impossible.  So then a coupe days after i decide that is what needs to happen mr.fucking PERFECT walks into the door and what happens? We have everything in common.  He's the perfect gentleman.  An artist.  A drummer (holy shit).  Tatoos.  A SINGER.  likes me.  i like him.  Hes 21.  point made.  Someday.  Allright well besides that, life has shifted a bit for me and alot of others.  A bitter sweet change in life happened on august 9th when good friend and practically sister of mine Crystal Brown passed away in a car accident. she will be loved, and i know that she is watching us from up there, or wherever her crazy self took her :-D  RIP-CB...she will be loved, we dance for you.

      haha i'm addicted its official oh well AAANYWAYS i think that the situation i am in right now is utterly rediculous, and i really shouldn't be thinking about this certain person anymore, because it is going to make things worse trying to convince either myself or anyone else for that matter that anyhting is going to work, but besides that...i am going to try my hardest to not hitnk about love right now, i'm talking about going out with someone, hooking up with people, all that shit.  I don't need any of it, im definatley not going to get into anything thats concidered JUST a hook up, because i have realized that those don't make me feel good in the long run, unless its with someone who actually loves me, which has only been the case with one guy, who is still around, but i'm just not sure what the case is with him even...we haven't hung out in forever, and i feel like i am losing communication with him.  But i still love him, you know? i don't know...i guess i'm just rambling... thats it for now, i'm just trying to forget about everything until my emotions shift a little bit, then i can return to regularity...until then, fuck you...HAHA im kidding, love most of you, keep it real

       This entry is an apology to someone, once you read it you will know who you are  Hi, lol. I have realzed over the past...hour that you and i are friends, and most likely will be (i can't predict the future). So with that stated, i want to say i am sorry for making a portion of your life really shitty and confusing. I know when we were together there was a part of that time that i was really a bitch (what most guys like to call a women :-D) and i know i was inconciderate, and confused, and not the best person i could be to you...I made every situation seem 10 times harder than it could have actually been, So i am sorry for anything that i did to have made any of this harder or more confusing, and i am sorry for blaming anything on you, because virtually nothing was your fault...and i understand if you are hurt, but i know we can still be really good friends, i don't doubt that. :) thats all, thank you. bye.
