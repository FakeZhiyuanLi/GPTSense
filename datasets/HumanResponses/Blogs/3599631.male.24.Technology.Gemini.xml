       So I got a  urlLink Gmail  account from  urlLink Fraser . So now you can send me an email at  urlLink jldera@gmail.com . However, my main email is still the one I'll read most often. Gmail seems like a nifty interface, we'll see how it works a bit.

       So it used to be that  urlLink Google  was just a search engine. Now they keep coming out with all of these other cool technologies based on searching. For example,  urlLink Froogle  allows you to search the web for low prices on pretty much anything. Of course, this whole  urlLink Blogger  thing is Google-owned now.  The real fun, however, is over at  urlLink Google Labs . That's where you can find all the cool stuff before it comes out. It's like going to an auto show and seeing the concept cars that just never get to market. Though a lot of Google's stuff comes to bear. I've been using Froogle for a while, it just recently got onto the Google homepage.  A pretty neat tool over in the Labs is the  urlLink Web Alert  tool. I don't know about you, but I've been known to do some  urlLink egosurfing  every once in a while. With Google's Web Alerts, i don't have to do it by hand anymore. Instead, the  urlLink results  are emailed to me. A new item comes up, I get an email about it.  So now I'll know when someone is talking smack about me, without ever having to look for myself. Computers: making life easier since the 60's.

       So, a little bit about myself. My name's Jason Deraleau. I'm in my mid 20's, 24 to be exact. I was born in the year of the Monkey and am a Gemini (at least, according to my  urlLink Blogger profile ). I live in western Massachusetts, which is located in the northeastern United States, which is located in the western hemisphere, which is located on the third planet from the sun, which is somewhere in a vast amount of void and matter known as the universe. You may have heard of it, you may not. I make no claims of knowing my audience.  I work with computers. I'm an IT administrator for a small business in Connecticut (somewhat south of that whole Massachusetts thing). My day to day involves managing several different servers of various operating systems. Going down the line, I have two running Windows 2000 Server, two running Mac OS X Server, one running Linux, and one running FreeBSD. I like to consider myself an equal opportunity OS employer. However, I honestly don't like Windows. I'd say I don't like Microsoft at all, but I have an Xbox and I have to admit it's a pretty good gaming system.  My true passion is for the Macintosh. While I would never have said such as recently as four years ago, in September of 2001 I bought my first Mac and I haven't looked back. I sometimes joke that Macs never existed before OS X, but I know that's not true. For example, I have an original Macintosh that has been hollowed out for use as a fish tank. There aren't any fish in it, mind you, because I can't seem to keep anything besides myself alive. I fear for my children, wherever they might be. Just kidding, I don't have any offspring. I think many people are thankful for that.  No, switching to the Mac was probably the smartest thing I've ever done. If I hadn't, I wouldn't have my current job, I wouldn't have written any  urlLink articles  for  urlLink O'Reilly , and I wouldn't be typing this on a beautiful 17" Apple Studio Display. I think I've taken the whole Mac thing to an extreme though. I've become quite a hypocrite, but also quite an evangelist. I love to be proved wrong and for every bad thing I've said about Apple in the past, I'm sure I've said at least two good things about the Mac maker. And I have plenty more good things to say about Apple, the Mac, and other technology stuff, so stay tuned.

       To be honest, I hate the word  blog . It just doesn't roll off the tongue very well. Blogggggggg. It's like saying blah, and we all know how dismissive  that  word is. In any case, I've signed up for  urlLink Blogger . Sure, part of it is to see if I get any  urlLink Gmail  invites, but I've been debating creating a more professional weblog that others can tune into.  Ya, I do have a personal  urlLink one  over at  urlLink LiveJournal . Plus I have  urlLink another  on the  urlLink O'Reilly Network . That one's pretty professional, but it's also pretty Mac-centric. As much as I love the Macintosh, I do keep up with other technologies and such. I don't update the ON one very often, either.  So here we are, gentle reader. Enjoy my musings!
