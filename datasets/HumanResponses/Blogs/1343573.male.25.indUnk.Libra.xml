       Well, I said I would post to Blogger everyday now, and, I'm keeping to my word.       I've decided, all the bad in the world must have a good side, every Ying has it's Yang, every black has it's white, you get the picture. So, here's to finding my light through my dark. Here's to being positive in a world of negativity. Here's to a future me and my thoughts having a flipside.       It's 7.55am in Brighton, UK. I've watched the sun rise - from looking out the window at work, I've been here since 05.00 this morning. I take 999 emergency calls from grief-stricken, panicked members of the public - actually, I take more calls about cows being loose on the road, still, it sure beats normal office work, it is at least interesting, unlike any job I've had before.      I get to surf the WWW whilst at work so that can't be bad. I've traveled all around the world, not in 80 days, but more like 80 minutes, from the comfort of my office chair and the internet. One day I'll go see it for myself.      I've been reading lots of other blogs over the last few hours, it's calming and reassuring to know that there are others out there with opinions and voices of their own, not led by the political heirachy that so many others seem to follow. It's a bit like the last scene from the 80's movie "Pump Up The Volume", where the young people finally take a stand, reach out and try to get themselves heard, even if only one person hears you, if that one person in the world gets to hear your thoughts,your message, it could make a difference.      I really don't know what my message is, or what I yearn for. I know my thoughts are deep, I know I get tied up in my dreams, sometimes it's hard to tell the difference between whats a dream, and whats a reality, but through blogger, I hope to find this from within myself. When I find it, I'll share it with you. When the thoughts run dry, Dravens message will be found, until then, welcome to the depths of Draven.

        Has it really been that long....nearly a year since I visted the world of Blogs, slapped wrists for me.  Well, I'm here again now and I intend to post every day, I need a diary, and what better place?       Dravens head is full of thoughts, thoughts of things I'd like to do, be doing, or should've done.  Thought about the world, the state of things in this world, and how a future little Draven will interpret all the hate that seems to be building up in the world right now.  Seems you can't turn on the TV, open a paper or a magazine, without seeing some kind of report about terrorism or a new war somewhere I've never heard of.  Why can't things just be, oh, whats the word, it escapes me it's been so long since ive heard it, oh thats it - peaceful?      I write poetry, i'm trying to finish a book thats been half written for about a year, but all the thoughts i try to put down are negative right now, not making for a great read.  Still, things might cheer up one day, and you might see a book on the shelf one day soon.      I have to go, as I'm at work, but I will post later.  Come back, there will be more from Dravens thoughts.
