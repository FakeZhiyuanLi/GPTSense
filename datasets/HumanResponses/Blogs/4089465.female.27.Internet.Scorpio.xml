      OK. This is what started this whole blog dream thing.  I found myself in this California desert town called Bakersfield. Well, the only reason I knew the place's name was because I asked this ex-friend, Walt, who happened to be there with me. Walt replied "You're in Bakersfield, California, don't you remember?  urlLink Amy  flew you out." Fair enough.  My surroundings: dusk or close to it. Dust. Cacti. Rocks of varying shapes and sizes. All together, not unlike a movie set. We were on the front porch of a house. Across the empty street was a little fast-foot place.  I walked over and stood to the left of the line at the counter and starting looking through an atlas to figure out where I was. To my right, a Phishhead (or maybe a DMBhead, who knows these days) came up to the counter and while purchasing a burrito started a conversation with me about atlases. During this conversation he mentioned he was from  urlLink Watertown, NY  - of course I exclaimed I grew up there (I did). Enough's enough, time to call Corey. I did find Bakersfield, California in the atlas before I left the counter.  Note: Bakersfield California is remarkably close IRL to the place I drempt it was, roughly speaking, since I remember California being somewhat more squat in my dream.   I tried using the pay phone any my calling card, but the operator told me we were over our ballance or some such nonsense. Feeling that old dreamy frustration kick in, I was told to try making a phone call at that arcade game in the corner - if you flip the right switches you can make outgoing calls. Cool!  Not cool, since no matter how I flipped the 9 or 10 different switches on the front of the machine, I couldn't make an outgoing call. From here on out it gets more guilt-ridden and panicky, and I'm going to try and just document the interesting part of my dreams - at least the parts that stick with me and not the parts that are just repetitive, unoriginal button-pushers for my psyche.   Note: I did what I thought would be a pointless Google search for "Bakersfield CA desert" the next morning, and Google - or fate! -  urlLink came through for me.   I realize most deserts look alike, generally, especially when you're talking about the American West deserts, but it was enough to really cement the wierd feeling I had all day. Of course, the barometric pressure was all fucked up that day as well and in hindsight I should probably blame that instead.

      Aaaaah, so stressed. MonkeyFest '04 (check out  urlLink www.monkey-fest.com  is the day after tomorrow. Jonny's building the stage today. The Health Department gave him a rash of shit today, but I think we can skate past it. We kinda have to, its too late now to stop! Too much forward momentum!  The out of town bands sound really awesome this year. I get the best spot in the festival - I'm a-swingin' beers from the Beer-O-Rama-Mobile - plus I'm stocking up on chips, Gatoraid, snacks, bug spray, and tobacco, just for sales. Ah, Shakedown Street all over again.  I still have to: burn mix CDs for Son of Disco Shakedown distribute flyers in Waverville get to the field and do a final rakedown  I took the day off tomorrow, as well as Friday/Monday. Jonny needs help. I want to make sure everything goes as smooth as possible.  Whoooooooooooooooooooohoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo..............

      The dream I had last night was long and involved, but what I remembered most when I awoke was the guest starring role of Aston Kutchner as a dreadlocked, crazed funeral director (or an embalmer maybe) smoking 4-foot bongs and telling me some conspiracy theory or another that fit into my dream logic, but damn he was hot.  And don't give me shit for thinking he's hot, either. I usually don't admit it - he is kinda a putz - but as far as eye candy goes, mmmmmmm-mmm.

      I take that back. People have thought I was wierd waaaaaaaay before I started scanning photos of dead people. But its my job! That makes it...wierd for profit. And in America, profit is never wierd.  My real Official Job is graphic and web design. I sound so fucking '99 when I say that, but then I think about it and realize I'm doing what I always wanted to do for a job, and plus I just kinda fell into it, so I call myself a hater and move on with my day. But you want to hear about dead people, right?  I work for a software company who designs software for funeral homes. Hey, they have to keep records and run reports too, missy, its a business just like any other. More on the myths and mythology of the funeral director (Is he really that pious? Is he thinking about sucking out my mother's vital juices with a stainless steel tube while he's upselling me on the leather bound register book package?) in later posts.  Sometimes I help out the funeral home next door by scanning in photos of the recently deceased for photo memorials, prayer cards, etc. Tonight I was really overloaded at work so I brought a selection of about 30 home with me to scan in for a service tomorrow. Now, since I've been doing this for almost two years, the odd feeling of spying on a dead person's life has pretty much faded when I tackle these little projects. But since I'm at my home, tucked in front of my little monitor on the big fake oak desk (monitor stickers: "I heart source code", "DSL is LSD backwards" and "Chuck D for President"), that reverant/intruder feeling is back. Dead people at my job I can handle, but in my own house? I'd feel better if C* walked in on me with porn on the monitor than...some normal dead guy. Granted, he was living in the pictures, but seriously.  So, in Photoshop right now, I have about 20 pics of Mr. Recently Passed On,  with his family, friends, and dog, at age 7 and at age however-old-he-was-last-year, that I'm methodically cropping, resizing, and saving as numbered .jpgs.  Smiling in a crazy '70s suit, wearing some crazy Bermuda shorts at a party, poking his head out of an RV window, posing with his siblings back when black and white was still your most common photo option.    * = C is my husband, whom I love too much to expose to the ravages of Internet blogging by name.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------   My funeral related rant of the day:  Who the fuck cares if the photo a family wants to use of their dear departed grandmother is one from 1939 when she was 18 and beautiful? I have actually heard disparaging comments about this choice, like complete and up-to-the-minute representation is required for a death notice or a prayer card.  Christ, this person probably thought of themselves as looking like that their entire lives, and now a family member is going to bitch because "that picture doesn't LOOK like Grandma!" Fuck you, buddy, if you weren't born 50 years too late and knew more about Grandma than her retirement home address, you might realize this beautiful young woman is just as much Grandma as the shrunken, aged body she left behind. And you had better not breathe a word of dissent if Grandma chose that photo herself to use when she made her preplans.  Me, I'm already Photoshopping a photo of myself at 18 to make me look hotter, taller, and give me better teeth, and you bet your ass I'll have that blown up poster size for my visitation when I kick it.
