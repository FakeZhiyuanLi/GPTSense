        Since blogs are apparently places where anyone can type just anything, then I guess I'm going to vent and tell the whole world how I'm "feeling"...which is, PISSED, because a certain "librarian" is a complete a-hole (click    urlLink   here      AND    urlLink   HERE      if you don't know who I'm talking about...but be sure to click hard on that last link)...and that pretty much sums it up for my feelings. I could embellish this, but I don't want to think about the one-minute-man any longer...I think I'll just go to sleep...yeah.

        Ugh...my family is so annoying...I wish I was back in Manitoba...at least there I didn't get yelled at...all the time, anyway...Matthew yelled at me a little...Anyway I've been awake since like, noon, because I couldn't sleep last night but then I went to bed at 7 AM...I fell asleep hugging Matthew's hoody that I stole from him before I left Manitoba...that's the second time I've done that... Now I've been up since then just listening to music the whole time pretty much...I downloaded a bunch of Nine Inch Nail songs again because I lost all mine when my computer crashed...but when I downloaded one song, I got a weird Marcio Niger version of it...it was all unsingy and creeping me out...so I kept it. Yeah, since this is my third post, I guess now is a good a time as any to introduce myself. I'M VALANN...or...Vallie, because I like that better. I'm everything in my profile, and...that's pretty much all that I can say about myself...Oh, I have a puppy named Muffy and she's the cutest little thing ever and she's one of my favourite things...my other favourite things are Matthew (one of my best friends...and lover I guess), and Lora (another of my best friends...and lover, I guess), all the rest of my best friends, robots, candy...things. Playdough is always fashionable, if you ask me...fun to decorate yourself with, but remember...NOT TO EAT!!     Anyway...August is almost over and school start September 7, and I still don't even know what school I'm going to, if at all O.o...yeah...anyway, I have nothing else to right...I'm depressed...

         Okay, well...maybe she isn't...but she's close enough. I was in Manitoba for 16 days...the whole time I was gone, my mom left my computer on, on the internet, with explorer open, on hotmail...uuggghhh...AND it was frozen...and it was like that for like TWO WEEKS...she just left it like that...so I restarted it, and now it's super super super slow...it took like 15 minutes to start up, and then 10 minutes to load explorer...my mom sucks at this...I should've locked my computer when I went away...too bad I never carry through with half of my threats...anyway...rantation!!!     I've been awake for over 24 hours!!! I woke up at 5 AM yesterday, now it's 7 AM...today...yay. I'm giddy and so so light-headed...I think I'd better go to sleep, but I had to post something before I did, because apparently I'm racing Matthew with posts or something...or not.

          Mmm...I'm not quite sure how to do this...but I'll try anyway...so...I'll just say what I did today. I had to wake up a five and drive to Winnipeg, to get on a plane to Montreal. Matthew's mom bought me a pretty sweater with a jasper bear pin thing on it, and it's all pretty...I stole Matthew's hoody because I was so upset that I forgot to take it off *shifty eyes* I was all crying and everything because I didn't want to leave Matthew, but then I somehow managed to rip myself away from him and board the plane...  There was this nice man on the plane that sat next to me, and I talked to him for a while, some of what he said was kind of eery, but he was really nice. He even offered to let me use his cell phone to call Matthew O.o  Anyway, then I had to stop in Montreal, and they confiscated my scissors...the scissors got all the way from Charlottetown airport, through Toronto airport, through Winnipeg airport twice, and only to get confiscated by the bloody French in Montreal airport. Anyway, I'm not bitter. So...then I flew from Montreal to Halifax, and stayed there for like two hours, and then flew from Halifax to Charlottetown...SUCH A LONG DAY. I saw lots of pretty weird people though, so that makes up for it. I saw this guy who screamed a lot, and I had to like, walk around with him for a bit...and I saw a girl who had tiny irises and pupils and her eyes were all cat-like, so she had to be accompanied by a person because she like, couldn't see because of it, or something.  Annnnnd...my puppy Muffy greeted me in Charlottetown so it was pretty coo. I didn't eat like anything all day except candy and a few pumpkin seeds so I went to Wendy's with my parents...but it was all crappy because I'd burnt my tongue on the sour candy that I'd eaten. Anyway, I'm bored of this now...so I'll write something later...
