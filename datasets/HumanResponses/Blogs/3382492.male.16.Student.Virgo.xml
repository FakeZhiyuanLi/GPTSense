      The average legal immigrant spends years in the process of becoming a US citizen. After rigorous tests, long legal forms, a citizrnship hearing, and a whole lot of head aches they may finally be rewarded citizenship. Mean while there are others who chose to bypass the system altogether, and they have a great loophole to get access to health care and social security, among other benefits. All they have to do to ensure a good life is pop out a baby on America (which will become an automatic citizen), and they are guaranteed the things all other citizens have worked so hard for. It is just not fair for the hardworking legal immigrants.  
 Background of the loophole  
In 1857 the Supreme Court ruled on the disastrous Dredd vs. Scott decision. They denied the right of citizenship, among other rights, to any African-American. To fix this injustice constitutional amendment fourteen was passed. The fourteenth amendment states  "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside."  Because America did not restrict immigration during that time they did not consider illegal immigration simply because it didn’t exist. They did not know that decades later people would be sneaking into America, that idea was non-existant at the time. 
 In today’s world   
The fourteenth amendment was a milestone in civil rights, but in today’s society it leaves us with a problem. Not every one having a child is legally here. It is important that we close this loophole and bring justice to our immigration system. It's time to stop rewarding illegal aliens with the very thing many spend years to achieve. Should the immigration system be re-done to speed it up? Yes, it is important for the future of America that we keep a steady flow of immigration coming in. But it is also important to know who is coming in, and if they might bring in any disease or bomb. I am not against immigration. It is what has made America great, but I do oppose people sneaking the back in when there is a huge line at the door waiting.

      First we must establish that the economy is getting better. The housing index has been used for a long time in America to determin how well the economy is doing. The index has risen this term, which means many are buying new homes. Unemployment on the other hand has gone down recently. In total, over 1.1 million jobs have been added since August, with 8 consecutive months of gains. The largest employment increases occurred in Florida (+29,000), North Carolina (+20,700), Missouri (+20,000), Michigan (+19,300), Texas (+17,000), and California (+16,300).  urlLink Find out how many new jobs your state added in April!   
At 5.6%, the national unemployment rate is below the average of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. The largest over-the-month unemployment rate decreases were reported in Michigan (-0.8 percentage point), Minnesota (-0.7 point), and Maine (-0.6 point). Another three states (Oregon, South Dakota, and Wisconsin) had decreases of 0.5 percentage point each.  urlLink Check your state data here. 
  
Now I must prove that John Kerry will kill the economy. When John Kerry gets into office he will raises taxes on the "rich"- i.e. $200,000+ per year; which is 3/4 of the small business owners in the U.S. Most small buisnesses file all of their taxes as personal to save money, and do not always reflect on how much money they have in the bank. Alot of the money is going to be used to further their buisness. It is going to cause business closures, job loss, and price hikes for those small buisnesses without the money free to pay the new taxes.  Plus we'll see a death tax introduced. Things that have already been taxed will be able to be taxed again when you die. Imagine your son or daughter not being able to keep a precious keepsake because they cant afford the tax on that item! Next comes the gas tax. (See gas tax article) With prices so high people will think twice before traveling down the street to spend money. Airplane prices, fed-ex, and prices to ship via semi-trucks will go up because of the high cost in fuel hurting the economy.      
 
As we can see John Kerrys tax policy will harm America. That's before we talk about the stock market reactions to these tax hikes, or any other effects.  What will 100 days of Kerry really look like?

      It is not a huge secret that gas prices are very high. Your "friend" John Kerry has spoken out against Bush for not doing enough to lower gas prices. Is this the same Kerry who plans to  raise  gas prices if he gets into office? This is one example of Kerry. He says one thing and will do the complete opposite.
