      Step up to the crease!  Here is the first of many overwhelmingly interesting posts, serving to inform the world of my futuristic vision.  Special mention needs to go out to my fellow visual prophets from the South African Institute of Visual and Aesthetic Significance (SAIVAS). Word to Nic Grobler, Sven Uhlig and David Bouwer!  Check out the following links:   http://nicgrobler.typepad.com/saivianation/  http://nkomazi.blogspot.com/  May the practice of online documentation serve as a tool that promotes living for a higher goal.

      Mr White, you made my day with your little 'stuff-up'!  Hetzner must be reckoning that we really like to play our cards open. ;-) Maybe they're thinking that we hope they'll offer us a better rate if they know we're gonna get it FREE somewhere else.  I also think that exploring the FREE hosting is a good option to explore. If it doesn't fulfill our requirements we can easily change our hosting. Our URLs will remain the same if it ever comes to that. I just want to make it clear that I don't want to be Mr Pink. I want to be Mr BurntUmber or Mr OliveGreen. Okay, lets just make it Mr Green.  Mr Green.

      dudes... I've found the mother of all free web hosting http://www.ihostfree.com/ This is like an equavalent of an R279 monthly account at hertzner. With no apparent catches. 500MB of space for each of us!...we'll have to test this out.... my credit card is not going through to register a domain name, some address inconsistency... maybe I'll check it out over the weekend sometime.  Vibe me your guts bru's.

      This one is not just free... it's quite fast. The question is..., can saivians live with ads on their sites?

      Hey Sir Snev, since I have registered my own hostname, I am battling to set up the hosting by myself at ihostfree, do you have any tips where I can start? Is there someone I can e-mail to ask them about it?

      Fellow SAIVIANS,  Just a quick note to say that it was really a pleasure to have spoken to you this morning. Its decision time for me again and talking to you guys will most definitely help me reach the right decision quicker. So thanks for that. You rock!  Just to let you know, I have registered the domain name www.svensven.com with ihostfree. To date there is nothing on the site, but at least I now have an address I am happy with. I will start posting bits and bobs to the site within the next two weeks. It’s a start and hopefully momentum will be gathered as we all start moving along. I’m looking forward to sharing my presence with you on the web in the near future. As Mr Grobler rightly said this morning: “Our future is fertile”   Carpe diem SAIVAS!
