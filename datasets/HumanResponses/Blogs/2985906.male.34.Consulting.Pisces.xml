      Stuff really pisses me off.  Sometimes it's stuff that would piss anyone off, but most of the time it's just because I'm physically and mentally exhausted all the time.  I've been doing this travelling to work for almost three years now and it's starting to take it's toll.  Four hours in the car every single day, plus a full days work on top of that.  I leave in the morning before my kids are up and I usually get home just in time to see them go to bed.  Weekends are usually a complete waste of time as I'm too knackered to do anything.  This should be the time when I spend quality time with them but every little thing they do winds me up.  It's wrong and I know I should have more patience with them but the Monday to Friday thing is to blame.  I look for jobs closer to home every single day but they're either not suitable or they don't pay enough.  I could take a lower paid job I suppose but that would mean we'd have to move to a smaller house, and we've all got used to the space.  Besides, moving is such a pain in the arse.

      What is it with those small-minded idiots on the local council? Are they genuinely stupid or do they just deliberately enjoy making stupid decisions?   My son goes to a local day nursery 3 days a week. A few years ago they moved to their new premises, they used to be next door. As part of this move the local council made the owner accept several new planning conditions. One of these is that the children are only allowed to play outside for 2 hours a day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. This, apparently, is because of the amount of noise disturbance that will affect the neighbours. Anyway, the owner applied to the council to have this extended to 4 hours a day and after a lot of waiting the matter finally came up at a recent council meeting. Depite having 45 letters in support of the application and only 4 against, the council decided to reject the application.   I just can't understand how they see this as being a balanced decision. Before the change of premises the kids could play outside all day but just because they move next door all of a sudden it becomes a major problem.   We hear all this stuff on the news about how we're supposed to encourage kids to get outside away from the TV, and then the local authority goes in completely the opposite direction and more or less says that we're not allowed to let our kids outside for more than 2 hours a day because they might make slightly too much noise.   What an absolute crock of shit.   I really cannot believe that the neighbours would be harmed or offended in any way by a bunch of kids making noise while playing. It's not like they're beating the crap out of each other all day or letting off fireworks or killing animals, they're playing for christ's sake. The ironic part was that one of the letters of complaint was from a group of students who live next door. They claim that the noise of the children playing would upset their studies. Tossers......   I could go on but I think perhaps I'm venting my frustration in the wrong place.   The only positive thing to come out of this is that my son was on TV the other night when the local news crew reported the issue. He thought it was brilliant watching himself and keeps wanting to watch it over and over again.

      I don't want to talk about it except to say that  urlLink this  man should be beaten to death, very slowly.  What a muppet, didn't even bother consulting his assistant who gave the goal and was much better placed.  I discovered this morning that he has his own website but even better than that is that there's a  urlLink feedback  section and even an option to join his  urlLink fan club .  Hmmm, must try and think of something constructive to write!!!  On the other hand I could put a contract out on him.  Know anyone?

      I had one of those conversations with my better half last night.  We were discussing tonights big  urlLink game  and I was telling her how the Portugese  urlLink manager  was a Brazilian and used to be their manager when they knocked us out of the World Cup 2 years ago.  The conversation then went as follows:   Her  But how can he be Brazilian if he manages Portugal?  Me  Hmmm......ok, and what nationality do you think  urlLink Sven  is?   Cue the sound of a large penny dropping, very slowly    Her  So they don't have to be the same nationality then.  The conversation went on a bit longer and included her asking why  urlLink Thierry Henry  can't play for England, because he plays for Arsenal.  I wonder why I bother sometimes.

      Good game last night, still trying to decide whether my English or French ancestry should prevail. ;-)

      Well it's all over now and has to go down as the hardest interview I've ever had.  Four and a half hours it lasted, which was 2 hours longer than planned so I'm hoping that means I was doing OK.  Just have to wait and see now......

      Well, today could be the day that things change.  I've got an interview later and I'm fairly hopeful that the job is mine as long as I don't screw up.  It's close to home and pays well, everything I'm looking for.
