      Well, I don't know what the dealy-o is. It's way late, I'm usually comatose-asleep by this point. I think part of it is a fear of re-entering the dream I left this morning - I was shot in my leg by a mugger, and it was just frame after frame of franticness. I don't remember much else, just immense pain, and panic. James seems to be staying asleep though. I hope he gets back on a schedule soon or he's going to have a lot of trouble once school starts. On other notes, I am pissed OFF at an online yarn retailer right now, because I ordered two bags of Diva ribbon yarn in the same color, and why would they send me two different dye lots? Oh, can't answer that question? Me neither. And a nice, painful way for me to learn a lesson about double-checking dye lots, since my ribbon cardigan in the round is done except for sleeves - complete with a faint color change mid-shoulder. So now I'm hoping I can unify the look by dyeing it - RIT should work, it's a wool/polyamide blend, so I guess I'm just gonna finish the sleeves & hope for the best. It pisses me off though, all that work, and makes me wanna chuck it. Except it also makes me want like $80 discount on my next purchase from them, since that's about what I spent on this yarn.  I am looking forward to hearing back from them to see if I ever buy from them again. On a sunnier, happier note, I have oodles of mohair from elann.com, love them, and pairing it with some fuchsia Brown Sheep, I have the uber-accessory of the season in my head, a poncho.  I guess everyone else is gonna have a poncho, so I better figure out if I'm doing the capelet sort or the rectangle sort. Everything I've read about Big Girl Design, a shaped one is better, but I like the pointy-ness from the squares. So, I must continue digging up designs. I hate how weekends go so fast, ya know? I need to figure out what other knitting classes I want to teach at the Yarn Store & More, and I need to catch up with Rob when he's back in town on Monday. We have so much cleaning to do tomorrow, plus I'm going to make pico de gallo with roasted garlic - YUM. I hope Six Feet Under is a good episode, too. The DVR has been a fabulous decision, if I dare pat myself on the back excessively. I can keep up with my soaps without them piling up for 5 hours on the weekend, what with the stop &amp; save feature that lets me pick back up watching it where I left off! woo hoo! Gotta love the gadgets. Well, I should try to go back & get some sleep. My mind was just whirring too much, and with Polly gnawing away on her nylabone, I couldn't let go to sink into sleep. Oh hell, I also need to do trivia for the company picnic, and I need to figure out if I'm doing something for the talent show.  Damn  damn damn. More to do tomorrow! I can't wait to talk to Liz about Terry's resignation - I miss my lizzie-lou-hou!

      One of the good things about going out of town or being on vacation around your birthday is that your birthday then seems to go on, and on, and on, what with make-up lunches, presents, and good-wishes from people! Today we had lunch at Thai Place, and there were 14 of us. It was really fun, except I'm disappointed that my friend Dana didn't like his food & said he wasn't ever going to try it again. I just don't understand being picky about food, even though James thinks I'm snobbish sometimes about what I'm willing to eat or what can or can't be on it. This has been a big food day, though, what with Lamar's for breakfast & then Liz's goodbye party at Uno's after work...... I feel bloated!!!!!

       I'm going to not be such a hater today. However, let's get the hate out of the way. Things that are wrong with today: 1. James is on crutches & therefore I am responsible for all ambulatory activity. This means taking care of the dogs, and since James has lost the key to the (locked) kennel, the only way to put the dogs up is to LIFT the kennel off the concrete on the far corner,and this morning, Miss Polly decided she just didn't want to go under. My neighbors probably are praying for me still, given the foul stream of Curse that I did not Edit and in fact, Shouted. As sweat was running in my eyes.   A few Thwacks later &amp; she is now safely inside her kennel.   2. People (or one person) who think(s) I need to be supervised. It's a title, not a calling. Give it up & leave me the F alone! I've been in the business longer than you and I don't need "mentoring" from someone my junior.   3. My onion breath   4. My headache   5. All this work!      Now, the good stuff.   1. James talked to (and showed his ankle to) Sarah's fiance', who's in school for Physical Therapy &amp; he said it isn't his Achilles Tendon, but either a heel spur or a small tendon that goes to the heel. Excellent. He also said a doctor would just say, "Stay off of it." So, crutches, good investment!   2. Got a call from my insurance agent, Ted Wheeler. Ted's the bomb. I always want to shop around & then I talk to Ted &amp; his service is Grade A. He had better news - they've adjusted zones & apparently for a couple years I was overpaying in insurance! So I'm getting a check for a couple hundred dollars. Yay!   3. I forgot to input round 2 rates for one of my stations, so I may be making more progress than earlier thought!   4. I now have the greatest assistant ever helping me with my paper palace, and she is doing an awesome job, which helps me do a better job on the bigger stuff!   5. Teaching Tunisian crochet was fun last night.   6. Diet Coke with Lime. I loves it.   7. BOLT CUTTERS. They will be my salvation. And also help me solve Bad Issue #1, because I will cut that padlock off and put in a new one, with numerous keys, and the main key will be on a small boat anchor so it is not easily LOST!      Well, the end of the work day is nearly here. I have just taken 3 Tylenol, which will hopefully sustain me through my volunteering tonight, and I need to remember to stop at Roger & David's to get my makeup bag so I can once again, be pretty.

      Today, I am a very tired hater. I am stuck in a bad spot & all I hear is the tape "I cannot do anything right." I think sometimes I just stop trying because it's simpler to sit &amp; fail than to be active & fail. But then I'll turn into that lady who's skin grew into her sofa &amp; they had to cut her out of it. And then she died. Badness.  I do not enjoy depression. (OH, scoff. I know there are some out there who practically revel in it. But no, they're not truly happy.)  I feel like work & life are big giant boulders, and while they are not bouncing down the mountain to land on my head, I feel like I'm wedged under them &amp; my shoulders &amp; chest are aching. I think that if I were an Army Ranger, this is what, say, hour 52 feels like on that no-sleep week of training. I am automatically piloting my life. It sucks.

       I ended my week informing James that everyone is out to get me, him included. The first half of the week was him gittin' me, then people at work lined up. Conspiracies abound. I know that muther F'er in that white van that nearly ran over Kristin was really coming for me. All signs point to a need for serious hibernation from society, living in a yurt, and taking baths in hot springs with mud.   Oh, wait, I can't, we have James' family reunion tomorrow!   Yippee!   (these things are always hard, I never remember anyone, because we only go every other year it seems, and I don't have any history with them.) I am taking the remaining pickles I made (thanks Martha, the zucchini pickles were a HIT.) Then it's celebrate James' birthday on sunday, complete with a trip to the dog track (that's new to me), PF Chang's (ok, I'll stay in society through Sunday) and cake & ice cream &amp; Six Feet Under. Somewhere in there I have to finish furry mittens for felting (if only my name were Fiona!) , do a TON of work I brought home (oh lord, I just can't wait! death, take me now! wait! lettuce wraps & Costco cake await! I'll do the work), and then the 800 other home things I never do: laundry, vacuuming, gardening, petkeeping (martha! send that dude over to wash my beasts), and have I mentioned the entire storage unit we've unloaded in the garage that IS ALL MINE? That remains to be sorted through, and where is that Mary Poppins wench when you need her? Spoonful of sugar won't make this chore list go down, more like half a bottle of Bombay Sapphire.    The good news is, the mitten's going FAST.    The bad news is, the Chiefs defense SUCK'T in their pre-season game. They must have many conspiracy people working against them.  Too.  The good news is, my Auntie Karen did not get hit by the hurricane &amp; they are safe.   There are many good things, I know this. I just get tired, and this was a week of Extraordinary Picking Upon My Nerves Like a Banjo, and I do not need another cross-eyed inbred young man on a bridge plucking out the rythym of my life next week.    We watched part one of Kill Bill tonight, and only Uma can make a canary-yellow track suit look good. I think if I got me some Okinawa steel, people at work might quit messin' with me. Maybe they'd start calling me "The Czarina" (like "The Bride"), too, and then maybe I'd grow to be 6' tall and have willowy limbs &amp; really long toes, just like Uma. But then I'd have to deal with Quentin's obsession, and as much as I love his movies, I do not need someone like that obsessed with me on top of everything else. Plus I'd probably be too tall to comfortably drive the Civic.    Hey, it's Friday the 13th. No wonder this week blew.        Can I just say the DQ commercials are flippin' hilarious? It only took ten+ years since I worked on that damn account, and they didn't even have to use a monkey.          Julia Child, we will miss you. What a life lived, though. Bravo.

      Walking towards the small kitchen, carrying my EMPTY Diet Coke with Lime can, that I had just finished dramatically crushing in front of Renee' and Troy to illustrate the stress levels plaguing our department & Stephanie passed me, and chirped, "Goin' to put that in the ice machine?"  I was literally doubled over, which is probably a frightening sight to see, however, it gave me great amusement and I will take it wherever I can git it 'round here.  (See previous post about yesterday's coke-in-the-ice-machine. It still won't be as funny to you. Promise.)  The second funny (Fright!) of the day came from Kristin, Princess of Yarn (I am the Czarina because I need to be foreign.)  urlLink http://www.ptleader.com/main.asp?SectionID=36&SubSectionID=55&amp;ArticleID=10138  Dudes & Dudettes everywhere, make SURE your metal needles have not been packed with gunpowder, and I forsee this tragic incident having a ripple effect BACK through the airline industry and the FAA banning the ol' knittin' needles again from air travel. Because it wouldn't be easier to just garrotte somebody with a circular needle, I'd like to try to pierce somebody's aorta with a size 0 needle that I've made razor sharp. Or create a dynamically exploding, highly targeted weapon by jamming C4 into the barrel of the needle. Nobody will believe you're serious when you try to set a needle up to their head, declaring you MUST be flown to Tahiti right NOW.  Whatever. I'm beginning to think that everything, virtually EVERYTHING in this world (or at least this country) is sustained by focusing on nit-pickley little shit that won't truly make a difference but creates volumes upon volumes of busy work for managerial types to "supervise" and none of the really goddamn important stuff gets attended to, because THAT is too hard. I do it, everybody does it, but you know what? People who make shitloads more money than me need to not do it, and focus on the hard stuff & get it figured out so the rest of us stop having tension headaches that start right about now.  Morrissey's singing about the Girlfriend in a Coma. That takes me back to such a simpler time. A time when you looked at the clock and said, "Yes, I can go to the Bar right now for Happy Hour, I will skip this godAwful Physiology of the Brain class!" God I hope if I ever end up in a Coma, James does not pull the plug on me. OH now on Retro Flashback at Lunch it's "Detachable Penis". My Uterus blogging friend might enjoy that as a theme song?

       1. Finish the tartalette scarf for Phyllis (birthday: 8/16)   2. Knit & felt Fuzzy Mittens for Yarn Store/Class. Yarn: Cascade 220 in pink, plus a furry pink eyelash.   3. Knit &amp; Felt Door Mitten for Yarn Store/Class. Yarn: Cascade 220 in bright cheery red.   4. Knit (uhhh, why do I keep putting "KNIT" as the active verb.) a poncho.   segue: Yes. Everybody under the sun will be sporting a poncho, and I figure with a quicky-trippy YO, k2 tog, knit the next row kinda pattern, I too, can sport a poncho of size. I plan to use my elann.com mohair that is a blend of raspberries & browns (I know, I do an internal "YIKES" every time I think about it, as I own nothing, repeat, NOTHING brown.) I am pairing the mohair with Lamb's Pride in fuchsia, to dominate the browns in their cheery bright pinkness and sustain the raspberries in the mohair. I hope it all works out.   5.  A wool Manly Sweater for my hubby. This will be a labor o' love! I will adapt Lucy Neatby's Big Gent's Sweater pattern, calculate short rows for his buddha belly, and as much as knitting in the round can be fun &amp; satisfying, I'm thinking this will have to be knit in pieces. Here's the logic. A. Need seams for this guy. This is an out-in-the-woods, on-the-lake hunting sweater. Seams will give it structure. B. Finishing each piece will give me greater satisfaction. Yarn: Acres of 100% wool in a dark gray. Brandname escapes me. Very rustic ball bands, as I recall.       Oh, don't be fooled. I probably have enough yarn, unfinished objects, and patterns to do a list totalling well over 100. The funny thing is, with all my stash & needles, I did NOT have a set of #11 DP's! So I risked a ticket (parking in the no parking zone/fire hydrant spot in front of the Studio over lunch) &amp; bought some today. James just laughed at me. Eventually, I will own the world & all the needles and yarn will be MINE, MINE MINE I telll you! MOOHAHAHAHAHA!      On a completely different note, somebody stashed an unopened can of Coke in the kitchen's ice machine this morning. Totally wigged me out. I live in squalor, I'll admit it. Dirt, germs, etc., don't normally get me too freaked out. But this just seemed to violate too many things. I give to you State's Evidence marked #1: The ice machine is not a flippin' COOLER! 2. People CONSUME the ice out of that machine, not put it in ziploc baggies and place it on their temples because they happen to work in a place that ignores morale as it circles the drain like the graying hair from your temples circles the drain in the shower. 3. People just seem to think they can do whatever the F they want because they want it and screw everybody else. A witness "outed" the culprit &amp; now I do fear for my safety, however, I do weigh about 3x the perpetrator's freshly-showered weigh-in weight, so I will trust in my ability to sit on her and subdue her, should a knife fight take place in the parking garage. God help me if it happens in the parking garage though, because the "security guards", and we use the word "security" quite loosely, are comprised of a man who could star in the Dukes of Hazzard - and maybe did - a woman who never moves &amp; stares out the door like a little nutcracker doll each night, and then - oh god help me if it's his shift - the man who is the father of the Dukes of Hazzard security guard, and sports about 4 teeth. Since he mostly smokes, I don't think he needs his teeth.       Well, I am frightened about the volume of work descending upon me, and I wish it were just my knitting list that were weighing on me. OH I have to go to bed, Reno 911 is back on as a repeat, and I love love love that show, but I DVR'd it so I should watch it at a time when I don't need immediate sleep, like now, 11:31 p.m. CST!

      I wrote a whole post and then tried to publish the Julia Stiles' scarf in it, and lost my whole damn blog.  Anyway, the curse of being a knitter is to delight in all things knitted, even at the movies. I coveted her scarf, it looks very Colinette-y!

       Well, I've been way behind on the ol' Ample Knitters list. And I feel like such a user-beyotch, because I've posted two desperate pleas for help in the past month, without staying caught up on everything. However, it's gotten so crazy with the whole "what's OT, don't post OT, Label your OT" blah-de-de-blah and with a list member I like leaving over it, I'm glad I was behind when it was happening! I think I'd have made the cranky complainers even MORE if they got a good dose of my rancor.  Well, no sense in spending any more on that.   I did put my Diva cardigan away for now. I will need to finish the sleeves, do all the trim & then - deep breath - knit some MORE swatch, do a practice swatch for dyeing, and then dye the whole thing. I still have not heard anything from YarnXpress, which honks me off, isn't it funny, how the more time that goes by, the more I just want a FREAKIN' apology for sending me two bags of different dye lots! WAH WAH WAH! I'm having a bitchy pity party! Bring some Doritos!   So right now, I'm knitting THE cutest baby sweater for my friend Julie, who is finally having the baby they tried so hard to "get". I told her at lunch yesterday that I am unnaturally excited about her pregnancy. I just feel like I understand how much she wanted this, and how disappointed they've been until the last go-round when the results were positive, it just feels like such a perfect blessing. People who want to have children as much as they do should have them! And a little girl - oh, the outfits I get to make her! :)  So I'll post what sort of yarn, I got it at the Studio during their sale, it's hot hot pink wrapped with a bunch of other colors. I also am enamored with the sweater Kristin knit for Janice's baby - it's SO flippin' cute. Baby sweaters are the best because, UNLIKE  a PLUS-SIZED CARDIGAN KNIT IN THE ROUND, they don't take UMPTEEN HOURS and then if you discover the dye lots are DIFFERENT, it's not the end of the freakin' UNIVERSE!   WEll, rant off. I'm off to play dominoes online against my hubby. He'll probably kick my patoot, because I'm out of practice at adding quickly in my head. :)
