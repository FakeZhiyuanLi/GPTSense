      My guy problems are never ending.  I've liked guys and they seem to like me back, but then they say that they like someone else. It's nerve racking.  Today I went out with Juju, Josh, and Anthony.  I felt like the third wheel the whole time; I hate that feeling.  I also get the feeling that Josh doesn't like me or maybe even feels threatened by me.  Juju says she gets that vibe sometimes too.  Oh well, roll with the punches.

      *sigh*  tonight was grrrreat!!  I met this guy named Josh while doing stage work for the play.  (he's the puppeteer for Audrey 2).  Well we've been gettin' to know each other and tonight he ended up going to Juju's with Juju, Joshie, and me.  We started out with just hangin' on the couch and a little cuddling.  As the night progressed though, he would blow raspberries on my face and shoulders, try to tickle me, run his fingers over my arms, and hold me.  Sometimes we would share marshmallows the fun way *wink wink* and funny noises to entertain ourselves.  When I finally got to kiss him it was perfect and I smiled which, I've never done when kissing anyone.  All night I've had a permanent grin from ear to ear and I'm to happy to sleep.  The only thing I hope for right now is for us to be together.

      I'm part of the stage crew for the play Little Shop of Horrors and I love it.  I get to see my friends act and spend time with them between scences.  Kyle and Sean are my favorite actors in the play, they just take to the characters so well.

      Yesterday was sad and very depressing.  The man I love just graduated and it broke my heart.  I mean for one I can never be with him and two I probably won't see him for a long time.  I told myself I wasn't gonna cry and to be happy for him and Amy but, when I saw him my heart shattered into small shards of despair.  Thats when the water show started and everyone kept wanting oncores.  There was some good though that came out of it, which is hard for me to believe.  Kyle gave me a shoulder to cry on and suggested to his mom we go for ice cream;  food therapy always helps.  Today I went to his house while Juju was at her Joshie's house and recieved the best welcome ever.  I was playing with his sister's cacti and he came up behind me, wrapped his arms around me and asked how I was doing.  We hung out and watched Mall Rats; it was great.  The best thing about him is i'm so comfortable around him that I can fall asleep in his prescence.  This may not seem like a big deal to you readers but, i've never been able to sleep around any guy before (even if it looked like I was).

      Lots to talk about. Okay Josh Rhodes was 2 timing me and that's not cool.&nbsp; I guess that was a good thing because now I have Codi, tehe.&nbsp; We hooked up when I went camping with all my friends.&nbsp; He so sweet!&nbsp; I'm sure how to go into detail on that but, he is.&nbsp; I know Josh Riggs says I'm only happy when I have a guy but, thats not true.&nbsp; I'm the same amount of happy as I was before, I just have this tremendously hot, sweet, loveable guy that brings a smile to my face. Is that soo hard to understand.&nbsp; ooh and KJ aka kyle I'm happy for you and kitty kat; I'm glad you two found each other.

      I love Codi so much sometimes I can't stand it.&nbsp; I haven't been able to spend more than 5 minutes with him in the past 2 days and it makes my heart ache.&nbsp; There's a problem though, if I tell him he might be frightened away.&nbsp; I feel like he doesn't feel remotely the same as I do, but Juju says he does.&nbsp; When I see or talk to him it seems like he doesn't even want to be near me unless he thinks he will get more than a cuddle and a kiss.&nbsp; The agony I feel is like any other and I wish it would just dissipate for, I can't take it much longer.&nbsp; As I write this blog entry he is with other girls doing God knows what.&nbsp; Yes I know I sound jealous and untrusting but, I can't help it anyone in their right mind would as I do.&nbsp; I also know I had the chance hang with him earlier but , when I&nbsp; asked him where he was going he said he didn't know and I can't just take off anywhere without knowing what we're doing.&nbsp; I cried tonight while talking with Juju about my dilemmas and I shouldn't burden her with that because she's probably annoyed with me already.&nbsp; Got to go being hollered at.
