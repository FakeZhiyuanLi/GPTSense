      I am blessed with the company of wise people.  I am always sure to ask their opinion...whether I follow it is another matter.  Some things I have heard lately from several of them has made me think.    I love places.  I love when one spot feels different than another, when people name things and the name stick, when it's hard to get around unless you've been there before, when there are local swimming holes in the creeks, when each and every hill is different from the one before it, when the sunrise and sunsets set the sky and countryside alight.  Naturally, I gravitate towards steep country, towards old neighborhoods, towards towns and cities with nature nearby.  I guess a lot of that has to do with me growing up in Austin and the nearby Hill Country, and a lot to do with me loving old Austin neighborhoods and the small, if cold, towns of New England.    Cities with nature nearby, in the U.S. at least, seem to be over-run with ugly suburbs.  Everyone wants to own a piece of it.  Not me; I want to live in town.  I wish everyone else wanted to too.  If I live near a town with nature, that nature better be well protected already.  I don't want to see it gobbled up by suburbs again.    So.  That's it.  That's all I want, a city or large town near a protected natural area (or areas) that has beautiful neighborhoods and a little river flowing through it or near it.  Preferably a town that's in the northern south or southern north.  It may be hard to find, but I am willing to compromise a bit anyway, so what does it matter?  It matters because my good friends are wondering if I will ever be satisfied with where I live.  I left Austin once (it was being over-developed, and was too hot), I didn’t like New Hampshire (too cold), I didn’t like St. Croix (tropical paradise, but far from family), and I don’t like Austin again now.  I LOVE the Austin of my memories, and I even like modern Austin as a place to have fun, but I don’t want to live here.  Or New Hampshire, or St. Croix.  In answer to my friends’ worries, I can only say: it’s a triangle, Austin-New Hampshire-St. Croix, and I have only lived at the extremes.    I’ve traveled through the middle (North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, etc.) and I liked it.  I liked it a lot.  I may fall in love with a place or many places there, and if I do, I am not going to leave them.  I am going to fight for where I live—-to stop ugly, improper developments, to protect water supplies, to keep the hills above towns beautiful and the natural areas protected.  I may live in a big city and have a house in the country.  I don’t know.  Whatever I do, I won’t run from a place I’ve lived again.  I just ask for a chance to fight for my place, to fight knowing the battle isn’t already lost.    I do know one thing about my satisfaction with living in one spot: it’s possible.  In fact, it’s already happened.  I have been completely satisfied with a place I stayed in for a while.  If I could move my family to Costa Rica, my whole family and my good friends, I would never come back to the States.  It’s that wonderful.    There is a road in the highlands of North Carolina that was  the  prettiest road in the world on the morning which I drove down it.  I think, I really do, that I will find it again.  Somewhere.

      A Tramp Texan (copyright, me, as of right now (June 18th, 2004), so don't you go stealing it without asking) is a world-traveling Texan.  Which, in Texas, means you've left the official seven-state Texan Traveling Area (TTA) more than twice (that’s Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado, and Mexico (yes, I know it’s a country but travel back and forth is frequent enough so we’ll call it a state for fun)).  I say twice because every Texan gets the urge to visit an uncle in Ohio sometimes, or go on a convention trip to New York City.  But traveling outside of the TTA is something that most Texans never do.  Many Texans rarely, if ever, leave Texas.  Most Texans never visit a foreign country other than Mexico.  Don’t look down on us, as travelers: we consider two-hour commutes doable and think nothing of driving an hour to the nearest grocery store.  Most of us simply do, well,  internal  traveling.  Texas is like a whole other country, you know?  Even to those of us from here.  The third time out of Texas is really the killer; it means you’ve gotten a taste for traveling.  My third time was my trip to Costa Rica in graduate school; forever more when I talk about Costa Rica, Texans inevitably turn to me and say, “Wow, you’ve traveled, haven’tcha?”  This is okay by me; I am proud of being a Tramp Texan.  I may be from Here, but I’ve been There.    Tramp Texans are legion.  You go around the world, and Texans are everywhere.   We include army soldiers, truckers, oil-industry workers, cowboys, and free-traveling souls.  We make for nostalgic expatriates, and we form Texas clubs everywhere we go.  How many states do you know of that have state-nostalgia clubs in London?  Tramp Texans are often responsible for terribly-themed expat bars where they serve strange margaritas and funny-tasting barbeque.  I believe there is a Tramp Texan bar in every oil-producing or –refining country in the world.  We inhabit out-of-the-way locales too; more so, I bet, than any other state.  We have cattlemen working in Venezuela, foresters working in Nicaragua, and stock traders in Singapore.  Texas is such a diverse state, and oil and cattle such important business concerns world-wide, that we are capable of infiltrating almost every society on earth (though we may let other states infiltrate Norway—it’s cold there.  But don’t they have oil?).    Texans are uniquely qualified to be tramps: we are  friendly , we are used to foreign cultures, we LOVE to talk, and we do well in societies where talking and alcohol are main activities.  It’s funny: many Tramp Texans are unhappy they ever left Texas, and many love Texas but would never go back.  For every two drunk oil riggers in an expat bar telling you about the glories of Killeen women, there’s an old cowboy who explains to you in a vintage drawl that he hasn’t left the island in 20 years and wouldn’t leave for nothing.  We can assimilate.    I left Texas many times, and for years at a time.  I have always returned home to visit, but I know for true now that I will never live here.  I have become a Tramp Texan, a drawling flotsam/jetsam on the currents of the world.  I hope I end up somewhere nice.  But I know, wherever I do end up, that I am joining the local Texas club.

      Some days I wake up when the sun comes up, but usually I go to back to sleep.  I wake up grudgingly, eat breakfast, and drag myself off to work at 9 am.  Usually I arrive around 915, but no one cares.  It's beautiful in the morning; dim clear light, cool wet air, and wind stirs in the trees like a sleeping lover.  When it's foggy, I think about clouds coming over mountaintops in New Hampshire.  It's the perfect temperature, and I think, "If all day were like this, I would LIVE outside."    By 1130 the clouds have burned off, the light has turned harsh and golden, and the temperature, while not baking (it's only June), is TOO hot for comfort.  The wind gets weak and sluggish, and the air dries out.  Three more months of summer are still to come: July and August will be oven-baking heat (read, 98-105) by 11 am, and September will mostly be like June.  Summer in Texas is a physical experience unmatched in the U.S.A., and really only surpassed in discomfort by the Middle East and Central Asia, where smart men wear robes to escape the heat and have many wives to distract them.  Here in Texas, on good days, I retreat into the office at 11 am to bask in the air-conditioning.  I wear shorts, not a robe.  I went to grad school in the great North because I loved hills and trees and thought I would like to escape the hot Texas summers, perhaps forever.  I think it is the consensus of everyone who knew me in New England that I probably overshot, a little bit.  I don't do well with -20 degrees air temperatures and five-month growing seasons.   After grad school, I (much to my surprise and consternation) landed a job in Texas doing just what I wanted to do.  Back to the Heat again I went.    As this summer begins to grind on into high gear, I think about a place intermediate between New England and Texas.  I love the heat, and I love the cold.  I just don't love the HEAT (months of greater than 95 degrees) or the COLD (months of less than 10 degrees).  So I've been thinking about...Virginia.    Virginia pros:  Not too hot, not too cold.  Full of interesting places, and the people are nice.  Not so many anti-environment, extreme Republicans there.  A long day's drive from Texas, and a day's drive from my girlfriend in NYC.  Mountains that have snow and creeks, and a beautiful coastline.  BBQ.    Virginia cons:  I haven't travelled Virginia extensively (though I've seen a little and liked it).  I know only 5 people there (my aunt, uncle, and three cousins in DC), so I'd be lonely at first.  Best nearby city is DC, which is a lil HUGE.  Gotta find a job.  Need lots of vacation to visit family in TX.  Have to talk girlfriend into visiting a lot.    These difficulties are surmountable.  The real difficulty is just getting myself to commit to this crazy idea of moving to a place just to enjoy the climate and land.  But as this summer gets warmer, I think my dream of just throwing everything into my old car and driving northeast will become harder and harder to resist.  If this blog suddenly stops for two weeks, you'll know where I went.

      I work at a nature preserve in the vicinity of Austin.  Suffice it to say that something breaks or goes wrong almost every single day.  The fence is broken by trespassers or car crashes--it takes an hour to fix each cut.  The old car won't start, and needs a jump.  The mower gets clinky, and needs to go to the shop.  The road develops a new rut, and needs grading again.  The rain storms last week caused the back roads to grow, and they need mowing again.  The trespassers are back again, riding their bikes, and I devise fiendish plans to chase them that never come to anything.  I could spend all day, every day on fixing the place and never catch up.  Every single day, my volunteers need something, or someone new wants to volunteer so I have to respond to their email.  I work long hours to answer their emails and needs, which just seems to generate more.  Sometimes I suspect they are actually more work than they are worth, as in the amount of work they accomplish.    Every single day, I run into a project I'd rather be working on: building something neat, raising trees for restoration, monitoring rare mussels, killing invasive plants.  These projects get put on the back-burner over and over again, and when I do do them, there is very rarely time to do them completely to my satisfaction.    Don't let anyone ever tell you that conservation is easy, that all you need to do is leave the poor animals and plants alone on their preserve.  It's hard-ass work just keeping people and their minions at arm's length.  Take it from me--nature preserves aren't exactly 'preserved' until you have a ten-foot wall around them and an entire army division manning the turrets. And, don't forget, fixing the dad-blamed roads.

      Not all my posts will be serious, I promise.  Although a good purging political rant is every bit as satisfying as winning at poker, it's not something you want to do all of the time, you lose friends that way.  I am a political animal, but a sort of detached one; I don't campaign, I don't read political fact sheets, or attend rallies, I just donate money (and that rarely).  Though, all that might change this year, the closer we get to the election.  I will keep you posted.  I put my heart into that last post, and I am not backing away from it at all.  I am moving on.    So far I haven't written much about Austin.  What can I say?  I guess I do have one thing to say, first and most importantly:  Whatever I say that's nice about Austin,  DON'T MOVE HERE .  This place is overcrowded already, and each new person counts (you will find this true in Austin traffic).  There are tons of Austins out in the U.S., waiting to be found and loved.  Go find your own; I will be joining you shortly.  I am not saying  DON'T MOVE HERE  because I don't want you to mess up my perfect space.  I am saying it because Austin is NOT perfect, and you will only make it less perfect by adding your car and development demands to the mess.  Austin is nice, a very cool place to hang out, but not to live, not anymore.  There are too many people here that want to own little bits of Paradise.  Now, the view is of the people: traffic, lines, suburbs.  I don't know of anyone that's seen Paradise lately, i think she's moved on.  So, WHATEVER I say that's nice, just come visit, give us a little of your money.   DON'T MOVE HERE .    So what can I say about Austin?  I grew up here.  It's wonderful, relaxed, and so rapidly changing.  I am not going to stay here for more than a couple of years (don't tell my nice boss, though I think he suspects).  It's too hard watching a unique place turn into a place like every other, too hard watching the beautiful countryside turn into suburbanized, upper-crust city.  I played on rough-grassed hills that now lie under green manicured lawns, flat streets, and over-large show houses.  I loved little restaurants that now lie perpetually besieged by tourists and hip California immigrants.  Austin is still Austin--lovable, rough at the heel, with a soul of outdoorsy, relaxed playfulness--but it's big business, now.  I'd like to stop mourning over the past one day; for me, that day will be the day I drive out of town for the East one last time.    That said, I am glad I came back.  It has reassured me that, no matter how many more people pile into this place and how much useless crap they build on empty, lovely land, some little pieces of my Austin will always exist.  Instead of thinking, "Where I am from is dead and gone.  Am I from anywhere anymore?", I now think of myself as an ex-Austinite in waiting.    I know I am someone who understands Barton Springs and the train at Zilker Park, who has played mini-golf at Peter Pan's, watched the bats come out from under Congress Bridge, who loved to eat at the Salt Lick, who knows where to get good Tex Mex, who swam every other weekend in the Comal, who knows to spin under the Zilker Christmas Tree,  who fell in love with a small city in the cool Texas fall.  That city still exists for me somewhere, and I will never lose it.  I thought, for a time, that was all that would be left of the original Austin: my memories.    I see now that East Austin is always going to be kooky neighborhoods full of big trees, hippies, and blacks and hispanic communities shoved across the tracks in the 60's.  I see that Zilker Park will always live, and Barton Springs will always flow, though that might take a good legal fight in years to come.  The endangered salamander at the heart of Austin, in Barton Springs, has a fighting chance to live.  Austin will always be Austin, at the heart.  The Hill Country at Austin's border will always have a few special places left to go re-visit.  Not everything will be lost to the relentless tide of immigration and ill=planned growth.  A few good things will always remain.  The other Austinites, the stronger ones than me, the ones able to stay and fight--they will keep them there.    Long live Austin, last of the dreaming cities.  I fear she may wake up soon, but I know now that her people will hold her in the night, dream or no dream.  That's what lovers do.

      It is raining in Austin, and it has been for three days.  It has been a wet spring, but this is ridiculous for sunny Austin.  My tomatoes have gotten so much water this spring that their cages are falling over, brought down by the abundance of new tomatoes.    I see in my overturned tomato cages a parable of nations.  A flood of wealth and power is dangerous if it washes at the roots of integrity and democracy.  The past century may be described in years to come as the century in which democratic principles were in constant conflict with the stresses of global war and temptations of economic expansion.  I speak not just of America now, but also of Venezuela, of Congo, of China, of Egypt, of Saudi Arabia.  All of these countries have been greatly influenced by poverty and sudden influxes of wealth, by war and reactions against war.  None of these countries, excepting only America, currently has a free and democratic government.  And some fear, perhaps rightly, that the U.S. is slipping on a treacherous slope.  Is Lady Liberty winning the war against dictators, the war against economic hegemony and the poverty of the masses, the war against war itself?  The largest country in the world is a dictatorship, the (let's call it like it is) Empire of China.  The second largest is a democracy.  The U.S., most of Europe, most of Latin America, the southern tip of Africa, and most of the Pacific Rim is free, with the notable exception of China and notable inclusion of India.  After two centuries of constant struggle for freedom, this is a respectable accomplishment on the part of the people of the world, a shining light for others to follow.  Across the rest of Asia and most of Africa, there are shadows and darkness.  Oligarchs run Russia and the CIS countries, Indonesia is a Javan hegemony supported by American military assistance, and the Arab world is full of dictators and zealot oligarchs.  Africa is wracked by instability, war, disease, and poverty, and the world watches with, for the most part, indifference.    Why is the world made like this, you might ask?  The easiest answer is that the rich countries wanted it to be this way; they chose the distribution of freedom in the world.  They supported dictators in little-noticed countries for economic and political gain, to fight the cause of the moment or exploit their resources quickly.  They, the rich and free countries of the world, supplied money, arms, and even soldiers to the cause of oppression and proxy war.    Democracy is just an empty word at home if it is not practiced everywhere.  Democracy in the rich, free countries of the world is under constant assault, not just by our enemies abroad, but by our actions abroad.    Take America, the posterchild of Freedom.  Every child killed in a foreign country in the 20th century by American troops, every democratically-elected official brought down by CIA action, every gun we sold to dictators that was used to quell bloody rebellions, every nation we invaded to protect our economic and political interest, every country we have troops in to keep the Pax Americana, these all are a blight on the face of Lady Liberty, and a blow to the cause of Democracy.  Only honesty, not blatant hypocrisy, will safeguard a republic of free people.  The U.S. would be more democratic, freer, and safer, if the entire world were more democratic, freer, and safer.    A more democratic, free, and safe U.S. would not necessarily be richer or more powerful...on the contrary, it would likely be poorer (but still rich) and less powerful.  But what is the point of endless riches if others starve in Africa because of it?  What is the point of power if your people must fear destruction in their beds at night?  The sweet taste of wealth and power has led our nation on a century-long (and still counting), never-ending chase after political and economic domination of the world.  And this chase has had clearly negative results.  Since the 1950s the democratic process that is at the heart of our country has been steadily eroded by economic forces and political corruption.  In that time, the U.S. has grown more equal, but not more free, more democratic.  Our foreign policy has increasingly been dictated by our military and economic interests, and our domestic policy has largely been one of neglect and lassez-faire growth.  For the last two decades, less than half of the registered voters actually voted; meaning that no President of the government of the People, by the People, and for the People has been elected by a majority of the People.  Our public servants, pressed by the need to get re-elected, care only about raising funds to pay for television advertisements that should be free.  Our money-driven politics is paralyzed by partisan bickering.    The gap between the rich and poor is larger than it has ever been in the history of our country.  The manufacturing industry, once a vital middle-class force and a generator of American capital, is in ruins.  Soil erosion is at an all-time high, and decades of subsidies has concentrated farming, once the American occupation, into the hands of a few heavy-handed megaconglomerates.  Only 3% of Americans farm anymore, and agricultural land and wildland is rapidly being swallowed by suburban development.  Our land, our beautiful land of purple mountains and amber grain, is becoming increasingly polluted by mercury, altered by global warming and invasive species, over-grazed, strip-mined, clear-cut, and fragmented by poorly managed growth of cities.  We are falling behind in the race to create sustainable technologies, we are exporting our scientists to other countries, and science and engineering, the American birthright, is no longer a favored profession for our young workforce.  Our cities and countryside are crushed by poverty that resists upswings in the economy, our youth are inured to violence and hypocrisy, and we live under constant threat of terrorist reprisals for our oppressive, interventionist foreign policy.    To all of this I say, as  urlLink Langston Hughes  so eloquently said: Let America be America again.  Let us be the steadfast, honest voice in the world for liberty, democracy, and human rights in the world.  Let our allies be only the free and the honest, and let our money follow our principles, not the reverse.  Let us own up to the hypocrisy in our past, and embrace the new promise of our future.  Let us be the America that never was, and will be.  Let America be America again.  Let us be a land of middle-class employment, of responsible corporations and people-sized businesses, of organic farms and small-town factories.  We want to respect our leaders again, and help our elected officials avoid having to sell their principles for the chance to be heard.  Let us free the poor from worrying about sick children, about homelessness, about starvation, and let them worry about finding a good job.    Let America be America again.  Let the parks show us beauty, not destruction, let the forests and farms be fruitful forever, not just once, let our air be clean, our waters pure, and the quilt of our landscape, unique and unfragmented.  Seize back our birthright of science and engineering, and put it to work on making the world's economy sustainable and pollution-free.  In a world with a growing population and diminishing water and unrenewable energy resources, the biggest growth industry of this century will be providing clean water, renewable energy, and energy-efficient appliances and vehicles.  Let us be the leader in the technologies of the future, not a follower.  Let America be America again.  We want to live, free of fear of attack by foreign terrorists, secure in the knowledge that our troops are not exposed to danger in foreign countries, and confident that our political leaders are not eroding our freedoms.  Let us all create the America that never was, but will be, one day, I know it.    Because as America goes, so goes the war for liberty and democracy.  The United States of America is the greatest democratic light of the world, and without her we doom humankind to a dark future of beleaguered freedoms, oligarchs, and warlords.  The wealth and power of this country is a by-product of the integrity and democracy that originally built it.  Let us prevent that wealth and power from being the ruin of this Republic, and let us restore this old house together.  She's beautiful, and she will be beautiful again.  Let us help America be America again.

      When I was a young teenager, my PawPaw began to fail.  First his memory went spotty, then his body became weak and bed-bound.  The pain, and delusions of pain, followed in a year or so.  This wonderful man, the storyteller and kind, wise grandfather of my life, he was my father-figure, the man I wanted to be when I grew up.  And I still do.    PawPaw was never wrong, never less than gentle and witty and all-knowing.  Near the end, when he forgot everything, forgetting all of his daughters, his grandchildren, his friends, he remembered precious little.  By some cruel quirk of mental wiring, he often remembered my face, even as he often forgot my mother's.  I had to introduce his own daughter to him, and I know that hurt Mom terribly.  When Pawpaw hurt, as he often did, he would cry out from his bed.  My mom and I answered his cries one day, and he told us, "My hair is on fire!"  As we patted his hair to put the fire out, he urgently directed us to each new spot, as if he were burning..  He was in real pain in his mind.  The fire out, my mom returned to the Thanksgiving cooking.  I stayed, to talk with PawPaw; he couldn't remember my name, but he remembered me.  The fire came back, and he helped place my hands on his head to put the flames out.  He thanked me.  I realized, at that moment, that I loved this man so intensely, that he had made my life meaningful and that he was taking something indescribably fine and good out of the world with him.  I cried in my heart, but I smiled at PawPaw.    I loved PawPaw.  My Mom loved PawPaw.  My Nana, who took care of PawPaw through two long years of sickness, holding his hand, cleaning him in bed, and watching her love lose his senses and memory, loved PawPaw.  I learned from Nana and PawPaw that love is not something you can keep like a treasure in a box; it is only something you can receive, and then give away.  Love is only alive when it is free.  Nana gave PawPaw away on a sad day some years ago.  Their love is living still in the hearts of our family, and it will burn there forever.  It will go down through every generation as kindness, gentleness, and good stories told to children.  It will outlast every evil of the world, and one day, we will give it away.

      In the last two days, I have slept little, driven much, lucked into a biblical case of chiggers, and had several valuable insights into the world's inner workings.    First, when you decide to go birding in Texas the morning, you learn things.  For one thing, the dawn is really pretty.  I never, ever get up before 6 am, so this was quite a nice thing to re-discover.  For another, birds are damn noisy, and fascinating in a sort of coral reef-fish fashion.  They just keep flashing in and out of your view, and they are entertaining little suckers.  How blind is the bulk of modern humanity, not to hear individual species on the air, see them fly, and see birds in their nests as we lumber by.  How blind I was, and still am, mostly.  But I know of my blindness, now, and that, I think, is the beginning of wonder.    Second, I have been rudely introduced to a couple unpleasant facts.  Poison ivy does indeed grow to the large shrub/small tree size.  This terrifying form of the nasty stuff occurs both in Isle of Shoals, Maine, and in Killeen, Texas.  Even heaven may not know where else it reaches that size, but I bet the Devil does know.    Another friend of the Devil, the chigger, has recently taught me that it can indeed occur in infestations of more than 100.  From my recent trip through the bushes of Killeen, I currently have more than 100 chiggers buried in my torso and waist.  While chlorinated pool water typically helps to kill the chiggers and reduce the duration of the itching from weeks to days, I discovered to my chagrin that it does not come close to stopping itching right away when you have a HUNDRED bites, and you are STUCK in a board meeting.  The Chigger is a wonderful insect.  For more information read this:  http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/2000/2100.html.  For those of you from the north (including my girlfriend) or California, rest assurred that chiggers are a common occurrence, everyone gets them now and then, and they are not catching.  This MANY chiggers is just the result of birding in poison-ivy bushes.    Third, I have learned that bats are the most beautiful creatures on earth.  If you don't believe me, go to the Bat Conservation International website, write them, find out where the nearest breeding cave is to your locality, and watch the bats emerge at dusk from their cave.  Thousands of bats whirl around like a tornado, a moving darkness, each individual bat more graceful and liquid than a dancer in the soul of the moment.  When they decide to go, they peel off in moving columns, flowing over the trees.  You see them in the sky like storm clouds of mercury, forming and re-forming with incredible speed and unending variations in form.  And this last for hours, repeating every night.  Those who wish for a little humility, a little insight into the vast mind of God, should go witness the endless peregrinations of bats.    Lastly, I have learned that two twenty-hour work-days are enough for anyone.  I miss talking to my wonderful girlfriend in New York City, and I haven't seen my community garden in days.  No doubt the squirrels are eating all of my tomatoes.  I highly recommend not doing the same thing every day; being a stick in the mud stops you from seeing the birds and bats, from the listening to the very pulse of the earth.  But maybe the birds AND the bats are a bit much to do all at once--they keep different hours, you know?

      But what better way to make sure people really do read your journal?  And to see if they like your writing?  And to get to complain, to REALLY complain, about this unjust world in the only place people listen anymore, the Net?  And, when something really cool comes along, to just share?  So, I am sharing.  Heaven help me.  And God save the King of Texas, Willie Nelson.

      Until recently, I must confess that I was quite a slob.  Although I did do my dishes and sweep my floor about once a month, I cleaned my room only when I had to, usually prior to the arrival of my mother or a hot date.  I never believed in being clean; I couldn't see one good reason to do it.  Hygiene?  Bah!  People can tolerate a lot of bacteria and dust before being bothering by it; most people could operate on their kitchen table, let alone eat off of it.  Self-respect?  Bah.  I respected myself a lot, and I preferred a comfortable mess.  Since I wasn't going to clean my apartment frequently without a defensible, honest reason to do it, I used to laugh at my mother's comments that "I'd change, one day."    About a year and a half ago, when I was 25, things started to, well, change.  I had switched from a Ph.D. track to a Masters track in Biology, and I had more free time--not much more, but just enough extra, worry-free time that I resolved to take better care of myself (read: exercise) and try my hand at cleaning the place once.  So I cleaned up my apartment, rediscovering many cool trinkets in the process.  One of these, my original Game Boy with the Chessmaster game, was definitely worth finding.   Finally I had found one good reason for cleaning: locating your stuff!   As every messy guy knows, if you can't find it, you don't own it.  And that sometimes can get expensive.    With that good start, I ran into the greatest of luck: I met my girlfriend, B.  B isn't a clean-freak by any means--she couldn't be, dating me--her attitude may be described as normally clean to slightly messy, and self-respecting.  What she did for me was give me an uncritical, funny audience I cared about impressing.  The apartment, once improved, stayed more or less improved until I moved out six months later.  I really didn't understand it, but I figured it had to do with getting older.  I just kept letting things go, then finding myself picking up before B came over or re-organizing after every time I couldn't find something.   School ended.  B went to NYC, and I went to Texas.  And yes, we are still together, and I am in love with her.  Soon after arriving home, I went to a job in the Virgin Islands, and I lived with seven people in a little house where we all shared a fridge.  I had eight by ten feet of personal space to be pseudo-messy in.  I was required to clean the kitchen as part of my job, but I had so few possessions I found I couldn't BE messy in my free time.  That was the second of my discoveries: being truly messy requires owning  too much stuff .  Being dirty is easy as pie, but being messy requires expenditures of money--for purchasing too much stuff, and buying a space bigger than you can clean.  I returned to Texas, moved into an apartment larger than I can afford, unpacked an ungodly number of boxes filled with files, books, and nick-knacks, and started a job that takes most of my organizational energy (see  urlLink an earlier post ).  Needless to say, I've back-slid.  Not to the level I was at back in grad school, but my place is often a big clothes and paper mess nowadays.  I can clean it, really clean it, in less than four hours, but it tends to return to disarray and chaos rather quickly.    Fear not, gentle souls: I have great plans to rectify this situation.  I can't quit my job; I like it, and my boss would be very sad.  But this place is too big for me (the bathtub is big enough to sleep in), so I will be moving into an efficiency or a small one-bedroom in January, first-thing.  Next, I need to get rid of all my unwanted, unused clothes, books, and scientific papers.  I have five large Tupperware container filled with ecological papers I will never read.  I can't burn them, and I can't give them away...any ideas?  I am considering burying them in sealed treasure chests, and then creating a map.  Then I will put the map in a bottle, cork the end, and...well, you get the idea.  Finally, there comes the most important part: I've got to talk my girlfriend into moving down to Texas and living with me.  Forget love and all those romantic notions; from an objective standpoint, I really just need her around to laugh at my piles of stuff.  I know what you are thinking: People from NYC don't move to Texas and like it.  Connecticut maybe, Long Island maybe, but not New York City.  That's may be true; I am just hoping she'll view it less as a move to Texas, and more like a temporary relief mission to encourage good sanitation.    If you have any ideas on how to be less messy, feel free to email them to me, but I will warn you: my copy of “Taming the Paper Tiger: Mastering the Mess in Your Life”, has been long-lost in the piles and drawers and boxes.

      In the last week, I have been to Austin and New York and Brownsville in Texas, and to New York City for the Fourth of July.  I have seen the sun set through pine trees and listened to the frogs at night, and looked across the Rio Grande at the palm forests of Mexico.  I have watched men in gangster exercise clothes mingle with blondes in sailor dresses on the bus, and marked the shuffling of longhaired, homeless men and women down the street, their carts loaded down with brooms and bags of recyclables.  I have spent an hour talking politics with the Border Patrol, and have stood beside the naked force of a flooding creek in the Hill Country.  I spent three happy hours driving across Texas in the middle of the night, arguing about culture with my girlfriend.  I saw the nest of Pale Male, New York City's only redtail hawk, on the side of a hotel.  I belly-laughed at Much Ado About Nothing in the heart of Central Park, and saw TV actors in person for the first time.  Did you know famous actors are real people too?  I didn’t.  I went fishing for crappie on a chocolate brown lake in the peaceful heavy wind of a Southern evening, people-watched on the Promenade in Brooklyn, and drove around a deserted nature preserve at dusk, watchful for illegal immigrants and drug-smugglers.  Italian food and the company of friends in the heart of the world’s greatest city, and walking through a thunderstorm on a dirt road, alone.  My life has been so full of glorious contradictions lately, I cannot even begin to interpret or digest the meaning of the wonderful sights I have beheld.  You know what I am going to do now?  Sleep.    When I wake up, maybe I will figure out what I have learned.  I don’t know; I suspect I will still be enrapt, in a state of continuous wonder.  This world....it is something, something glorious and terrible, a joy and a mystery.

      When you face the blank page of life, I heartily recommend that you start writing right away, don't erase too much, and never, ever stop to edit.  There is nothing better than true love, nothing worse than death, and the only way to learn is to try and fail (often, depending on your learning curve, repeatedly).  Life is what happens to us when we are making other mistakes.  Mess-ups are creation, literally.  A new species is like a mountain built out of a few critical mutations, a few mistakes in the language of DNA.  Life is failures, life is learning from failures, life is living to fail again.  Somewhere in there, if we allow ourselves to fail, we make a few great decisions.  In mistakes and their correction, we create liberty, we create knowledge, we create freedom, we create a good life.

      It is more fashionable to be jaded about politics than to be interested in it.  And, well, every third news story you see involves politics, be it the war in Iraq, the presidential race, or corrupt politicians putting another one over on the American people.  I personally like to tune out all that rubbish, and just enjoy my life.  Except, well, I can't do that.  I love my country, I love my citizenship, and I am going to vote this November.  My vote may not change the status quo, it may not alter the direction of the country, but it will be a statement.  I am not afraid of the cynical truth about our government, and I am not afraid of trying to make a difference and failing.  The only failure I can make is to not try.  After making that statement, after voting for John Kerry and a change, I am going to go out, get some Chinese food and root beer, and plunk myself down on my friend's couch for a night of cringing and yelling at the elections on TV.  I will have earned it--because if you vote Democratic in Texas, you have nothing to lose, and everything to gain.  Down with the Shrub!
