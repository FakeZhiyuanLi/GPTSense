         I woke up early……I was excited ‘coz I’m gonna see Jason Mraz! The whole day……I played Jason’s cd over and over! For those who have been living under a rock, Jason Mraz is a 26-year-old singer/songwriter from Mechanicsville, Virginia. He’s the dude behind such radio hits as "Sleep All Day," "The Remedy," and "You and I Both." And he has an uncanny resemblance to actor Hugh Grant. At 7pm, My friend Marvin (‘d ultimate j. mraz fan!) & I went @yes fm station, it’s located beside Aliw Theater where the "big event" was held. Jobert a.k.a. "Edu Mansanas" (my co-edt oldy* who’s now a dj) is the disc jock from 6-9pm. We stayed @the booth ‘til 8:30pm. jobert interviewed us &amp; we made fun of vin! (…in tv u call it televised……what about in radio!? radiovised???) Haha. It’s cool to be a dj. And then it was time to go to Aliw for the much awaited concert. When we came in…Paolo Santos was already performing. Everybody was busy looking for their seats, chatting, texting, checking their cel camera and nobody seems to notice that the front act started already! Haha. And then Jason Mraz and his band came out on stage! In his comfy polo-and-jeans attire (and, ofcourse, his omnipresent hat), he looks nothing more than your average Joe, but with a little more wit and charisma. And a hefty dash of naughtiness to boot. He never ran out of gimmicks or jokes, even coming out wearing roller skates for the finale. In short, the 2 hrs. show was nothing less than fun and fabulous. Whew! What a nyt! 2T bucks = definitely WORTH IT!

         Our 1st laco gs/hs batchm8s outing! I woke up early, my head still ache a bit…still have sore throat. But I have to get moving and pack my clothes for the outing. And before leaving the house, must not forget the medicines…eeiuuww. Meet up with batchm8s and then we were on our way to the resort. After so many mind boggling troubles, we finally get inside sitio lucia in bulacan! Some aren’t going to stay overnyt so we have to make the most of the afternoon. 1st outing together of my dear friend berlyn with her 1st ever bf rommie……diary worthy itu! Ahaha. This is one of my fave scene…the dinner. It was nice. I was full and at the same tym glad that I decided to come and spend this day with all of them. A week ago, I was hesitant to go, for some petty reasons, aside from my being sick. Then it was tym for the others to go home. For the nyt swimming, we played at the pool (Aissa & Joan, 2 of my buddies in 3rd yr high!—memoirs flooding in!). But before that, mama elmer had to put make-up on gizelle and I had to fix her hair…why?! Hell…I don’t know! She just wanted to luk lyk a gyrlash that nyt! Linda blair in the haus…pray over! Haha. And at midnight, we spent about an hour or two at the KTV bar. Some of them sang on the stage. Wonderful. And then the riotous yet exciting charades, with the ever "sungit" alvin as the host =P. category: tv shows, movies (X-MEN, gagamboy, himala, dadedidodu, ET, magic kitchen, etc. -- &amp; yeah, sherrie in the abyss of her dreams). boys won. I don’t know how! I felt lyk we were getting the ryt answers and they were not…but when the game was over, yeah they did win. Well, it didn’t matter, we had fun anyway. Most of them were lyk bat-empty already…especially the guys, because of the alcohol I guess. I didn’t sleep, even for a minute. Thank goodness jessie, rholette & conrad were also up all nyt. We chatted &amp; I was able to learn some jokes from them (nasty ones!) Hehe. And then it was tym to leave sitio……gizelle, allan, rommie, berlyn, alvin, mike, rholette, jessie, elmer, joan, aissa, chris ember, joben, michelle, sherrie anne, lalaine, conrad……guys, each of u made this get together a memorable one for me! ;)

         Intercollegiate Dance Contest @ateneo (Irwin theater-8pm). Irene, tyrone &amp; I watched with the rest of the edt members. UST-Eng’g Dance Troupe joined. They performed patrick’s ‘basura’ dance…the one which made them win the 1st place in UST’s dance contest last 2002. 15 dance groups from different universities/colleges competed. Douglas Quijano (the super strict choreographer), Jason Masda (break dance champion), Fritz (of the Big Men) were three of the five judges. Chiqui Roa-Pineda hosted the event. UP Filipiniana won…they danced really well. One of the most beautiful performance I have ever seen! Thumbs up to those ten girls. Miriam College grabbed the 2nd place and UP Dansa 3rd. well…my dear edt didn’t get anything, but they were really good…I miss dancing! it was touching when CSB dance troupe performed in the tune of BEP’s ‘where is the love?’. They were all deaf/mute…they just feel the vibrations and dance without hearing the music. It’s funny that some of us can actually hear the music well but still can’t dance with it! Haha. I learned the proper way to clap for the deaf/mute…all u gotta do is shake ur hands up in the air. It’s nice to see how other people make the most of what they have…I felt so blessed after this night.

         Dinner with ezil, grace & stel @pancake house in glorietta. Coffee @starbucks 6750 after. People are all over coffee shops nowadays. I wonder what kind of coffee I’d be??? Hmmm……I’d probably be an iced coffee ‘coz I’m cool, then a little bit of caramel ‘coz I’m sweet and a double espresso shot ‘coz I lyk to think I’m strong.

        Erik "El Terible" Morales (Mexico) won over Carlos "Famoso" Hernandez (Dominican Republic). Morales peppered Hernandez with jabs and rocked him with right uppercuts to take a unanimous decision in their super featherweight title unification. My kuya Edison & I were glued in our respective seats…this was a great fight! No, it was not one for ripley’s. But, for Muhammad Ali’s sake, did u see what Morales &amp; Hernandez did to each other in the 12th and final round?! They hugged like loving brothers, then proceeded to lock horns and blast at each other on one of the most ferocious final 3 minutes of a world boxing championship. It was both warm and amazing. Morales has an awesome record of 47-1! He was defeated once by another Mexican, Marco Antonio Barrera. And come to think of it, Pacquiao won over Barrera last year. I personally believe he has a chance against Morales. Pacquiao’s aiming to go after the so-called triumvirate of Mexican boxing, namely, Barrera, Marquez (whom he fought with 1st quarter of this year and had an unfair draw decision), and ultimately Morales.
