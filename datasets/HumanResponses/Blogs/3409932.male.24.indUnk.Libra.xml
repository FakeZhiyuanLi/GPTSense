      For those of you who don't care about F1 may I firstly say that you're missing out. A lot of people have suggested in the last few years that F1 has become a boring and one sided sport with Ferrari dominating and other teams failing to meet the challenge. That coupled with the fact that the smaller teams get less and less screen time and less advertising money would seem to make the problem worse.   Today, however, was a race which reminded this slightly jaded F1 fan quite why the sport is so great. Monaco is a wonderful track, you can't hold off for a second and the result can often be very hard to predict. If memory serves me 14 cars went out before the end and some of them in spectacular style. I won't go into detail but if you do care and you missed it you can read up on it  urlLink here . I was going to post a picture of the winner but you may not know the result and be wanting to watch it so on reflection I'll not bother. Not that I flatter myself that I've got more than 3 readers :)  It's one of those truly lovely Sunday afternoons. I've not spent much time out in the sun if I'm honest but a coffee with some friends this morning was enough to mark it out as a particularly nice one. In our island home we get precious few lovely days like this so I should really go for a run or something like that and make the most of it. It's only early evening and the lighter nights mean that I can take a little more time and write a little more nonsense before I head out.   As well as some work today, because I don't work enough as it is, while the GP was on I also wiped my Windows machine and reinstalled everything. It's a much happier little box now and I've decided that I've been playing with these machines for far too long given how easy it was to just strip it and start again whilst watching something else. Perhaps I need to get out more :)  All this reminds me that I should also run a backup today too - perhaps while I'm out running? :) See how you can have 2 or three ideas and they all fit into place. That would be on account of this being such a lovely Sunday. And with that I shall take my leave of you good people to finish my work and do some form of exercise. I've also just received a text on my delightful  urlLink N-Gage QD  telling me that a friend is about to come online so I should prepare to tell him all my exciting news. I've not seen him in at least 3 hours so I'm sure to have lots.  'til next time  Iain

      Please be gentle with me today as I'm feeling a little bit delicate. I must emphasise at this point that it is entirely self inflicted and the result of one too many beers last night. It's always that last one that gets you isn't it and you realise at about 5:30am when you wake up with a start that it was a very bad idea.   I'm currently taking a minute out from some work I'm doing for the reprobates who took me out and got me so drunk last night. Some friends from Manchester are starting a new venture and have asked that I give them a hand with some visual elements which means that on this glorious day I am sitting in front of my computer. If it weren't such a lovely computer I would be inconsolable :)        In other news I have recently discovered the joy of Halo on the XBOX. With all the fuss that was made of Halo 2 at E3 the other week I decided that I'd given Halo a hard time and that with all that hype I must be missing something. One of the journalists I was in LA with sang its praises and I decided to ask my good friends at  urlLink CA Games  to furnish me with a copy to see what I'd missed out on. I have to say that I'm really getting into it. Perhaps it's because the focus has shifted to the new one that I can now look at the original in a more objective fashion but whatever the reason I'm really enjoying it. I fear that this may be a short lived sensation as I'm assured by a good friend that as you go on all the levels start to look the same. It's something I've already noticed about some of the locations but thus far the AI and combat situations are keeping me entertained. Those Warthog jeep things are ridiculously hard to pilot though. Not a fan and it's hopefully something that Bungie will see fit to change in the sequel.  I should probably get back to it, I'm sure the boys will be on their way back from the shops now and I've been promised a pizza for lunch as long as I work hard :)  toodleoo Iain

      Hello!  I'm back. I've missed having a blog and thought it was about time that I had one again but I couldn't face writing the back end for it, or rather the work involved in designing a front end and getting help with the back end so I decided to use some perfectly good existing technology :)  I'm going to be writing something proper later on but in the meantime it's lovely to be back and be sure that I'm going to add all kinds of cool postings from time to time. I've lots of E3 tales to tell and a few choice piccies to post up :)  ttyl Iain

      Pah! I laugh in the face of your silly tube strike!  This I say now of course before I have tried to get home ... it's probably a very silly thing to do but I am firmly of the opinion that I can and will be as successful going home as I was coming in this morning. The route I take is all overground, train then bus, so with the exception of the masses more people actually on the road and walking about it was a pretty normal commute. Well done Ken for getting all those busses on the roads I say - but I say it quietly so that cab drivers and people who need their car for work don't hear me ;)  I noticed something today actually which I've been meaning to write about for ages now actually. Namely that I've noticed a really odd sensory effect whenever I'm in London. As you walk about the place it's hard to notice everything around you because there's so much. So many people and so many different things to look at. In fact you'd think that with so many people around it was pretty much impossible to notice anything in any great detail. I mean, I see where I'm going and all that but I don't tend to really see things. My sense of smell on the other hand seems to pick up on things in a really bizarre manner. Now that I write it I have to admit it sounds incredibly lame but it feels significant some how.   I can be walking along in a part of London which means very little to me and then a smell from some food, or a car or someone walking by makes me think about something or will catch my nostrils despite all the smog and dirt and other things getting in the way. I guess I'm just impressed that one smell can be picked out along side all the others or perhaps I'm just grateful that something distracts me momentarily from the smell of car fumes :) I'm not really sure which but it certainly seems a little perculiar to me.   And probably doesn't make very exciting reading ...  I should probably think about going home, I have a leaving bash to attend and with the potential chaos on the roads I want to leave early to avoid disappointment as I have a very very early train journey to a meeting in the morning. Y'all have fun and I will catch you very soon. Wish me luck getting home :)  Iain

       urlLink This sort of nonsense needs to stop right now!   Reality TV is pretty much the only format that seems to get commissioned these days and this new Christian take on the knockout musician wannabe format has got to be a step too far hasn't it? I know that the church is desperate for the press but this is proof if any were necessary that nothing is sacred anymore.   I'm not religious. I generally feel that there are loads of great ideas in religions from all over the world but ultimately the problem with them is that people are in charge of them. The great Stan Lee taught us that "With great power, there must also come great responsibility." and the power that TV has to touch lives can undoubtedly do a lot to promote the Christian cause. Except that's not why people will watch it. If it is a success it'll be because 'good' honest folk will be paraded for our amusement so that we can not only laugh at their ability or lack of it but also mock them for their honesty about their faith. The sound bite potential is very very high and the lowest common denominator TV format loves nothing more than to just rip it out of whoever they've put on screen. Look at Emma and what's-her-name who were in the bedsit on Big Brother. I would hope to God that they're not as dull witted as the show makes them out to be but that's also what makes them fun to watch and is certainly one of the reasons they've been put in that house. It makes us feel better about ourselves.   It also makes me sad that people like Michael Moore come under fire on a very regular basis for trying to highlight injustices and genuine problems with the society that we live in and Pop Idol and Big Brother are constantly commissioned the world over.   Grumble grumble grumble ... See the real problem I guess is that they're just giving us what gets ratings - which makes me about as sad about this as I can get. It's not that I hate popular culture either. I love the huge cash cows like Harry Potter and Star Wars as much as the next brainwashed corporate whore. It's just that I remember when the first series of Big Brother came out. It was a fresh and exciting concept because the people in there had no idea whether or not anyone was even watching. The excitement and enjoyment came from 10 people not all getting on very well and having animated conversations about how pointless it all was because no one was watching. At around the same time I was treated to all my fave shows like Buffy and could look forward to new cool shows like Angel. The thing is though that all these dramas are finishing and being replaced by nice cheap reality TV where the actors are free and the papers and magazines pick up the tab once they're out in the real world again. Meanwhile I've nothing new to fill that regular story telling void that has always been filled by something for the last 15 years from Lost in Space and Quantum leap to 24 and Spooks.  I know that this is quite an angry rant and that once I've stopped typing this a hundred or so great shows will pop into my head. I think that there's a far larger proportion of this crap on TV than there used to be and it's a problem that we should address before there's nothing but reality TV on our screens. It's also probably something to do with the time of year and my regular show appetite will probably be filled again come Autumn. The times they are a changin' and for once this liberal minded twenty something isn't sure that change is such a good thing.  Iain

      I have decided for the first time today to take a break.  I ate my lunch at my desk because I had a meeting which lasted until 12:30 and have decided that I'm going to need at least a half hour break if I'm to apply myself properly to my already burgeoning afternoons work. It's the end of week 2 and it is fair to say they're working me hard. Thankfully everyone is very helpful - if a little stressed today for some reason which I'm assuming isn't me because otherwise they'd have said something.  So highlights of the week? Well I've been working on proposals for work, I've been reading the fifth Harry Potter book  urlLink "Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix "  which is excellent and generally celebrating the fact that the  urlLink iTunes  music store is now available in the UK. I've been celebrating but I've not actually had time to buy anything yet. It's probably a good thing I don't waste my money anyway :)  In other news I have been accepted to the  urlLink GMail  beta program. A wholly unimpressive feat given that I now know of a few other people who seem to have gained access to it as easily as I did and as such I am feeling far less smug and 'Geek' cool than I was before. Gmail is a fabulous product. Messages are presented in a conversational format so you can see the entire flow of a conversation which is very useful when you've got multiple recipients and have had a conversation involving all of them. This isn't exactly revolutionary but the way that it is laid out seems to work really well. I am also a huge fan of the concept of using Google's search engine to search my e-mail. It's stupidly fast and although a little primitive looking I'm sure that's going to change. There's a lot of storage there and I challenge anyone to really use that gigabyte of space, and I mean use it not just fill it up with crap because you can and to test their system. I like the idea of never deleting stuff and so far the spam filters and all that jazz seem to be working well for me too. They've already identified the porn junk that I get sent on a regular basis and filter far more effectively than my desktop does.   So yeah, it's good and as weeks go this one looks like it's been a particularly geeky one but what can I say. You're reading this so you know by now that it's all this sort of stuff that gets me going. I'm sure I've had 10 minutes of my break by now so I'm going to head downstairs and make myself a nice cuppa and come back to attack financial spreadsheets.   Toodleoo  Iain

      Your starter for 10 is naming the song that the title of this post comes from. Very easy but should provide those of you struggling, as I am, to keep your brain going in the heat a few moments amusement.   Welcome back, I've missed you all terribly. This week feels like the longest of my life so far and it's only Wednesday. I started on Monday in a simply delightful office filled with very busy creative and technical folk. It is safe to say that my work life for the foreseeable future is going to be hectic. Having said that I am starting to settle into a little bit of a routine and although three days in no way constitute an experience of London life I am at least a little more confident that I can do it. Had you asked me at 10:30 last night I'd have wanted to go home and even at some points today I wanted the world to stop so I could get off but now I'm home, settled and have a cup of tea in front of me. I'm feeling pretty good.   London is a bustly place but I think I can get used to that. What I can't get used to is the possibility of paying Â£9 for a cinema ticket. Last nights trip to the rather excellent Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkabahn was an eye opener. May help me to lose weight though because at that price I'm not yet prepared to go for popcorn and drink :)   I should go sleep as this has been interrupted on and off over the last hour by phone calls and such and I've an early start involving presentations from a client tomorrow so I really should be super awake and alert. I also have my first trip to the gym planned which is rather exciting I think you'll agree. Even if you don't, I'm looking forward to it.  Toodleoo the noo  I

      It has been a funny day to be sure. Not least because it started with me feeling a little rough after a night on the booze with some friends. I've landed a new job and to celebrate my imminent departure to pastures new I went out last night with my flatmates to have a couple of drinks. A number of mojitos later on top of wine and champagne and it's fair to say I had given my body good enough reason to kick up a stink.  There was no time to waste today, however, as I finished up some work for a client and hit the road and headed to Edinburgh on something of a goodbye tour. Saw two friends who I've not seen in ages and it was very nice to see them again. It made me realise that I've not taken full advantage of the capital while I've been up here and that ironically it's something I may explore more when I've moved away and come back for weekends. On top of the excitement of seeing E & J there was a rather nice unexpected surprise. The Dalai Lama was in town and as I walked down part of the Royal Mile I was greeted by a crowd of people.   "I wonder what this is" asks J and is answered by a tired looking photographer with a huge camera and tripod who looks unhappy at having to navigate the growing crowd. After 25 minutes and having avoided the temptation to tell newcomers to the crowd that we're waiting for Iain Farrell and that he's "really cool" the man himself appears and from 20ft away is every bit the smiling man that you've come to know and love from the TV or books you may have read. You can read a piece about his trip  urlLink here . I especially like the part where his laugh is referred to as being similar to that of the late great Sid James. The man I saw today could definitely have that kind of laugh and get away with it.   So my hectic week continues. I start my new job down south on Monday with an amazing company and can't wait to get going. It's going to be a challenge but I'm most definitely ready for it. Have lots to do before I leave and should really be rested to do it. It's past midnight and way past my bedtime so I shall bid you adieu.  ttfn Iain

I suspect that eventually some kind of relationship could have been struck but now we'll never know.   I don't know if you can download the Real software now but my advice would be to download it now if you do want it in case it goes away although why you'd want to hack and potentially damage your iPod is a mystery to me.

       urlLink BBC NEWS | England | Leicestershire | Game blamed for hammer murder   The issue I have with this type of story is not that the game may have influenced his behavior but the assumption that of all the influences on his life this is the one which caused the murder.  This type of story has always troubled me not least because the media is following publicly something which I feel is likely a reaction to the sense of helplessness in relation to losing their son.   I realise that they have suffered a loss and I cannot even begin to understand what that must be like especially when you feel that you can see a clear cause but banning a video game isn't going to help or necessarily save anyone in the future.   This is dodgy ground because the closest thing to this I've ever been through was my Mum dying and that was due to an illness. If I could have blamed a form of media would it have helped me through it? Maybe, but if I could would banning the game that caused it really ease my pain. I suspect that in the long term probably not.

      I've been doing patchy posts for a while now and it's mostly due to being so busy at work. My free time has been prioritised to things like going to the gym to ensure that I don't get fat. I'm testing out Jamie Cullum's theory that I'd find 'things much easier with a tight six pack'. Well it's worth a go and if I really go for it a better toned bod could be my Christmas present to myself.  The reason for the post, however, was that I have discovered  urlLink BBC 6 Music  and would highly recommend a listen if you like to listen to great music during your day but with intelligent banter.   Also the lovely Vic McGlynn replied to my e-mails and played a song for me. The station has a new best friend and I'd certainly give it a go - love your BBC and get the most out of your license fee :) One word of warning though, if you like new tunes, and who with an iPod doesn't, make sure you've got a way of noting artists down. I got through 2 post-its in an hour yesterday and I wrote small and everythin'!  Better head and get some work done :)  Iain

      Yesterday was a good day. Had a very busy one at work but knew I was heading out later in the evening to meet a friend from Glasgow who I've not seen in quite a while. She happened to be in London and invited me to an art exhibition - see previous post.  I set off with printed map from TFL.gov.uk in hand and headed for the busses. Upon alighting at Holborn I set off on the last part of my journey on foot and who do you suppose I saw? I saw Whoopi Goldberg! She was leaving a bar/ restarant and headed over to a bus stop to look up - presumably, the bus back to wherever she is/was staying. How cool is that?! I stopped at the bus stop even though I didn't need the bus and pretended to be sending a text for just long enough to be sure it was her and that she really was trying to avoid the eye contact of passers by. I don't think many other people around her knew who she was. Satisfied that the last tihng she wanted was me to say hi to her and tell her that I loved her films and appearances in Star Trek I continued on my way ... and phoned my step dad to tell him who I'd seen.   Still recovering from the excitement of my chance encounter I arrived at the startlingly posh private members club just off the strand where the event was being held. A couple of free wines later coupled with discussion of whether or not there is such a thing as a comedy editor in film and places to live in London - something of a recurring theme at the moment, we were ready to eat.   In that time we had been joined by a very good friend of the person I was meeting who brought along her kids and husband and the seven of us headed out to a great chinese place in Leicester Square.  Great evening and am very proud that I was able to make my way there and home without getting lost! An achievement I think you'll agere.  Must dash, have a leaving presentation to attend and am flat hunting over the weekend. Wish me luck :)

      So yeah ... I want super powers. Not a terribly surprising state of affairs but I think is only going to be a problem as long as I'm reading comics on the way into work. As soon as my latest batch is out of the way I'm going to be back to normal and not thinking on my way out of the train station that it would be easier to get around these people if I could leap buildings in a single bound or float.  But the commute is still fun which is surprising given I've been here a month and still don't mind it.  I have a pretty busy week actually. Work is keeping me entertained of course, but I have been invited to the opening of an exhibition in the city later this week. A prominent Scottish artist by the name of Julie Brook is showing her new work. You can find out more about her  urlLink here . I'm not really terribly well read but it should be an interesting event and if nothing else will be populated with interesting people, wine and a good friend I've not seen in far too long. Also may go see a movie afterwards so any recommendations gratefully received.   In other news I am taking this Friday off work so that I can nail the flat hunting. Should be a good opportunity to get in there and try and have a place by the middle of the following week. I'm staying with a friend just now and it's great but I don't want to take the piss. She lives alone ordinarily and it's very good of her to have me stay at all and I don't want to overdo it.  Well my work is calling me and I should really answer but have a great one whatever you're doing
